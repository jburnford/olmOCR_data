Hudson styled it emphatically the 'Great River,' or the 'Great River of the Mountains;' no doubt from the extraordinary circumstance of such a body of water flowing through the mountains without a cataract. The name of its discoverer, however, was early attached to it. I find it familiarly called Hudson's river, in some of the public documents of the Dutch colonial government; but more frequently the North river, to distinguish it from the Delaware, which was discovered by the same navigator, and which being within the territory claimed by the Dutch, was called by them the South river.\n\n\"The Dutch immediately began to avail themselves of the advantage which the discovery of Hudson presented to their view. In 1610, it appears that at least one ship was sent hither by the East India Company, for the purpose of trading in furs, which it is well known continued for a number of years to be the principal object of commercial attraction to this part of the new world.",

A number of settlers during this year were sent out, under the command of Cornelis Jacobse Mey, who were most heartily welcomed by the few previous inhabitants. Before these arrived they had been two years without supplies, and had been obliged to cut up the sails of some of their boats for necessary clothing.",

Minuit is considered by some as the first Governor or Director of\nNew Netherland. Subordinate to him, the gradation of authority and rank seems to have been: 1. Opper-Koopman; 2. Onder-Koopman; 3. Koopman; 4. Assistant. The office of Opper-Koopman, chief-merchant or commissary, was vested in Isaac de Raiser.

At this period, the English and French extended their settlements in the colonies, and each were anxious to secure the most eligible situations for trading-houses and forts.

These lands consisted of two parts: one part comprehended all that part of the state lying west of a line beginning at the north at the mouth of Great Sodus bay, on Lake Ontario, and running thence southerly to the north line of Pennsylvania, except one mile on the east side of Niagara river, and the islands in that stream.",

It was fortunately, however, firmly sustained by the proposer and his friends, and finally sanctioned upon the principle, 'that it could do no harm and might do some good.' But the joint committee, possessed in favor of the Oswego route, directed the surveyor-general to cause a survey of the rivers, streams, and waters in the usual route between Hudson river and Lake Erie, and such other route as he might deem proper; shifting to the surveyor-general the responsibility of countenancing a project deemed absurd.",

The government of the city was extremely rigid, and often cruel; it bore the character more of a military despotism than that of a civil police; heavy penalties were imposed for the least infraction of the laws regulating the trade with the Indians, and many families consequently ruined. This severity drove some of the \"traders\" to the Schenectady flats, where they intercepted a considerable portion of the fur on its way to Albany, and which occasioned for many years the most bitter animosities between the inhabitants of both places. The circulating medium then in use consisted principally of sewant, or wampum.\n\nMinisters of the reformed religion were regularly sent out from Holland to the colony. In 1657, the Rev.
