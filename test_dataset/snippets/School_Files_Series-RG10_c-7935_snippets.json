The two Cayuga boys were sent after I came to complete a course of treatment begun before the holiday. There is no charge appearing in the account for those former treatments.\n\nThe mastoid operation for Ralph Smart was an emergency operation. He has been directed by his doctor to go to the hospital.

You will note that he states that she is not a fit subject to continue in residence in the Institute, and that she should be placed in a Preventorium. Pursuant to suggestion from Mr. Phelan, I have interviewed the authorities of the Brant Sanatorium and they will admit her to their Preventorium provided, of course, her admission is authorized by the Department with the assurance that the usual fee of $1.00 per diem charged to municipalities will be paid.

Bishop Anderson who was at Albany was summoned and was making satisfactory arrangement to have the work of the schools continued. He has placed in charge Rev. Griffin from Albany until more satisfactory arrangement can be made.\n\nIt was discovered that several of the children in the boarding school were very badly affected with T.B. and gland trouble, so a weeding out was necessary in order to prevent the spread amongst the other pupils. Dr. Day examined every pupil and as a result some action had to be taken.\n\nIn the school there were five Neepineskum orphan children. Lizzie died last winter with T.B., and three of the other children Mary, Peter and Henry have developed the disease. These children are orphans and Bishop Anderson has agreed to place these children with the grandmother and to be looked after and properly rationed until such time as they are able to return to school, on condition that the Department continues to allow the usual grant to be paid the school for them.",
