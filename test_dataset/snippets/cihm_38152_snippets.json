Some of these seem to have been inscribed by lovers: and others, in a delicate and unsteady hand, and a little inaccurate in the spelling, have evidently been written by the young ladies themselves, or by female friends, who had been on visits to the Hall. Mrs. Phillips seems to have been their favourite author, and they have distributed the names of her\nheroes and heroines among their circle of intimacy. Sometimes, in a male hand, the verse bewails the cruelty of beauty and the sufferings of constant love; while in a female hand it prudishly confines itself to lamenting the parting of female friends. The bow-window of my bed-room, which has, doubtless, been inhabited by one of these beauties, has several of these inscriptions.",

Master Simon did, indeed, go to the races, and that with a new horse; and the dashing widow did make her appearance in her curriicle; but it was unfortunately driven by a strapping young Irish dragoon, with whom even Master Simon's self-complacency would not allow him to enter into competition, and to whom she was married shortly after.\n\nIt was a matter of sore chagrin to Master Simon for several months, having never before been fully committed. The dullest head in the family had a joke upon him; and there is no one that likes less to be bantered than an absolute joker. He took refuge for a time at Lady Lillycraft's, until the matter should blow over; and occupied himself by looking over her accounts, regulating the village choir, and inculcating loyalty into a pet bullfinch by teaching him to whistle \"God save the King.\"\n\nHe has now pretty nearly recovered from the mortification; holds up his head, and laughs as much as any one; again affects to pity married men, and is particularly facetious about widows, when Lady Lillycraft is not by.",

Thus, I have overheard a very solemn consultation between Lady Lillycraft, the parson, and Master Simon, as to whether the marriage ought not to be postponed until the coming month.\n\nWith all the charms of the flowery month of May, there is, I find, an ancient prejudice against it as a marrying month. An old proverb says, \"To wed in May, is to wed poverty.\" Now, as Lady Lillycraft is very much given to believe in lucky and unlucky times and seasons, and indeed is very superstitious on all points relating to the tender passion, this old proverb seems to have taken great hold upon her mind. She recollects two or three instances in her own knowledge of matches that took place in this month, and proved very unfortunate.",

However, there was an anecdote told by Mr. Van Rensselaer, and preserved by his son, and the story goes thus:\n\nAbout the year 1675, Mr. Tappaan, of New Amsterdam, Hoboken, and other places, heard the appearance of a Dutch\nand alarm; but the next flash would show her far off, always sailing against the wind. Sometimes, in quiet moonlight nights, she would be seen under some high bluff of the highlands, all in deep shadow, excepting her top-sails glittering in the moon-beams: by the time, however, that the voyagers would reach the place, there would be no ship to be seen; and when they had passed on for some distance, and looked back, behold! there she was again, with her top-sails in the moonshine! Her appearance was always just after, or just before, or just in the midst of unruly weather; and she was known by all the skippers and voyagers of the Hudson by the name of \"The Storm-Ship.\"\n\nThese reports perplexed the governor and his council more than ever; and it would be endless to repeat the conjectures and opinions that were uttered on the subject.",

Around the table were two or three dogs in attendance. Maida, the old staghound, took his seat at Scott's elbow, looking up wistfully in his master's eye; while Finette, the pet spaniel, placed herself near Mrs. Scott, by whom, I soon perceived, she was completely spoiled.\n\nThe conversation happening to turn on the merits of his dogs, Scott spoke with great feeling and affection of his favourite, Camp, who is depicted by his side in the earlier engravings of him. He talked of him as of a real friend whom he had lost, and Sophia Scott, looking up archly in his face, observed that papa shed a few tears when poor Camp died.",

The heart of Robert Bruce, the hero of Scotland, had been buried in it. He dwelt on the beautiful story of Bruce's pious and chivalrous request in his dying hour, that his heart might be carried to the Holy Land and placed in the Holy Sepulchre, in fulfilment of a vow of pilgrimage; and of the loyal expedition of Sir James Douglas to convey the glorious relic. Much might be made, he said, out of the adventures of Sir James in that adventurous age; of his fortunes in Spain, and his death in a crusade against the Moors; with the subsequent fortunes of the heart of Robert Bruce, until it was brought back to its native land, and enshrined within the holy walls of Melrose.",

He found the house full of guests, Scott's whole time was taken up in riding and driving about the country, or in social conversation at home.\n\n\"All this time,\" said Wilkie to me, \"I did not presume to ask Mr. Scott to sit for his portrait, for I saw he had not a moment to spare; I waited for the guests to go away, but as fast as one went another arrived, and so it continued for several days, and with each set he was completely occupied. At length all went off, and we were quiet. I thought, however, Mr. Scott will now shut himself up among his books and papers, for he has to make up for lost time; it won't do for me to ask him now to sit for his picture. Laidlaw, who managed his estate, came in, and Scott turned to him, as I supposed, to consult about business. 'Laidlaw,' said he, 'to-morrow morning we'll go across the water, and take the dogs with us—there's a place where I think we shall be able to find a hare.'\"\n\n\"In short,\" added Wilkie, \"I found that instead of business he was thinking only of amusement, as if he had nothing in the world to occupy him; so I no longer feared to intrude upon him.\"\n\nThe conversation of Scott was frank, hearty, picturesque, and dramatic.",

I set out for the Hall on horseback, in company with Colonel Wildman, and followed by the great Newfoundland-dog Boatswain. In the course of our ride we visited a spot memorable in the love-story I have cited. It was the scene of this parting interview between Byron and Miss Chaworth, prior to her marriage. A long ridge of upland advances into the valley of Newstead, like a promontory into a lake, and was formerly crowned by a beautiful grove, a landmark to the neighbouring country. The grove and promontory are graphically described by Lord Byron in his \"Dream,\" and an exquisite picture given of himself, and the lovely object of his boyish idolatry:\n\n\"I saw two beings in the hues of youth\nStanding upon a hill, a gentle hill,\nGreen, and of mild declivity, the last\nAs 'twere the cape of a long ridge of such,\nSave that there was no sea to lave its base,\nBut a most living landscape, and the wave\nOf woods and corn-fields, and the abodes of men,\nScatter'd at intervals, and wreathing smoke...\"\nArising from such rustic roofs;—the hill\nWas crown'd with a peculiar diadem\nOf trees, in circular array, so fixed,\nNot by the sport of nature, but of man:\nThese two, a maiden and a youth, were there,\nGazing—the one on all that was beneath\nFair as herself—but the boy gazed on her;\nAnd both were fair, and one was beautiful:\nAnd both were young—yet not alike in youth.",

In crossing a street a cart came along, driven at a rapid rate. The driver called out to her, but she was too deaf to hear his voice or the rattling of his cart.
