In such regions the process of alternate prairie and forest making may be constantly observed, fire being the great factor on one hand, and natural tendency on the other. The prairie soils, it may hence be inferred, are peculiarly rich in nitrates and phosphates, those great nourishers of plant life, and it is from these virgin regions that America must ultimately draw its supply of wheat.\nCARSCADEN,\nPECK & CO.,\nMANUFACTURERS OF\nCLOTHING\nHats, Caps, Fur Goods\nAnd Men's Furnishings\nWHOLESALE.\n\nManufactory—622 St. Lawrence Main Street, Montreal.\nWarehouses—Cor.

Numerous old Indian graves attest that the Prince Albert flat must in early days have been a meeting place of the Indians, owing no doubt to its easy landings and to its large area of camping ground; but more perhaps to its central situation, for the Indians had a keen eye to convenience, and their ancient rallying points are invariably the sites of the white men's cities of to-day.\n\nThese features, no doubt, commended the spot to the subsequent founder of the Mission of Prince Albert in 1866, the late Mr. Nisbett, around whose farm has extended within recent years what is now the well-known capital of Saskatchewan.",

The climate, food and water are all that can be desired. Within the past five years this great branch of our future wealth has made some wonderful strides; every year has seen not only the natural increase but large herds of the best grades imported, and today there is no question as to its future for all kinds of stock raising purposes.",
