A detachment was mounted on the horses of the country and immediately pushed on up the Mississippi to surprise the villages there. They were all taken as secretly and suddenly as Kaskaskia, and the power of Great Britain was entirely broken in the Mississippi River country, by the sudden onslaught of a few hundred men.\n\nWinning the favor of the French at Kaskaskia by kindness and shrewd management, Clark got them to take the oath of allegiance to the United States. Then he dispatched a friendly priest, Father Gibault, to sound the people at Vincennes, an old French settlement on the Wabash which had become a British post, and which now lay between Clark and the American settlements.",

But the son came not, and the great Blue Jacket Mining Company never found its mine.\nCHAPTER XI.\n\nDEATH OF WAWILLAWAY—TECUMSEH AS A PEACE-MAKER.\n\nWe again find Tecumseh engaged in hunting, in the spring of 1795, on Deer Creek. This occupation he carried on more as pastime than as business. It is said of him, on the authority of those captives and half-breeds who knew him well, that he was not avaricious, but that his generosity was proverbial. The furs that he caught or the goods acquired by exchange were dispensed with a bountiful hand. He did not hunt for the purpose of bettering his fortunes, but from love for it as a manly and soldierly employment, and as a means of furnishing food to those who were not able to hunt for themselves.",

An Indian agent, Mr. Jouett, wrote to the governor that he feared this meeting would result in some\nhostile movement on the frontier, and advised that the Prophet should be seized and imprisoned, in order to extinguish his influence. General Harrison rejected this proposition, probably because so violent a measure would have precipitated hostilities with Tecumseh's band.\n\nThe Pottawatomies and Kickapoos granted Tecumseh and the Prophet a tract of land on the Tippecanoe, one of the tributaries of the Wabash River. To this place, in the western part of what is now the State of Indiana, Tecumseh and the Prophet, with their party, started to remove in the spring of 1808, much to the relief, no doubt, of their civilized neighbors in Ohio.",

When they found that he was encamped two miles further up the river, they immediately started off, saying they intended to kill him.\n\nA Mr. John Sells was told of the visit of the Indians the next morning, and started off for Leatherlips' camp. He came upon the six warriors, who were headed, it is believed, by the chief Roundhead, seated in council in a grove of sugar maples a short distance from Leatherlips' lodge. The old chief, with his arms tied with a slight cord, sat calmly in their midst. A few white neighbors were also present, and a sullen and gloomy Indian, who had been Leatherlips' companion, sat apart in the camp. Going up to the Indians, Mr. Sells found them in\nearnest debate.",

The accusers spoke with much ceremony, but evidently very bitterly. The prisoner answered eloquently, but without passion, occasionally smiling disdainfully. The council was closed with a sentence of death. Some of the white men inquired as to the time of the execution. The captain of the accusers pointed to the sun, indicating one o'clock. Mr. Sells asked him what Leatherlips had done.\n\n\"Very bad Indian,\" answered he; \"make good Indian sick; make horse sick; make die; very bad chief.\" Mr. Sells tried to induce the white men to interfere for the safety of the chief, but they refused, fearing the results of Indian animosity on their unprotected settlements.",

Up to this time there was no weapon visible. Leatherlips again sank on his knees and prayed as before. In this position he remained, after he had finished praying, until the fatal blow was struck, with a tomahawk suddenly drawn from beneath the blanket of the leader.\n\nLeatherlips, in all his rich clothing and decorations, was then buried, and the executioners returned as they had come.\n\nThis execution is believed to have taken place by order of the Prophet.",

The agent urged him to state his complaints against the government. The Prophet replied that the Indians had been cheated of their lands; that a sale to be valid must be\nsanctioned by all the tribes. Mr. Dubois told him that he ought to go to Vincennes and present his complaints to the governor.\n\nThe Prophet declined doing this, saying that he had been badly treated on his former visit. Mr. Dubois also visited the Wea and Eel River tribes. They were fearful that war would break out, and that they would be involved in it.\n\nOn the 4th of July, four canoes filled with some of the Prophet's followers descended the Wabash. One of these canoes, containing some Kickapoos, came down as low as a settlement above Vincennes, where they stopped and attended a Shaker meeting on Sunday.",

When this messenger reached the Prophet's Town he was received in very dramatic fashion. He was first conducted ceremoniously to the place where the Prophet, surrounded by a number of Indians, was seated. Here he was left standing at the distance of about ten feet from the Indian prophet. \"He looked at me,\" said Mr. Baron, \"for several minutes, without speaking or making any sign of recognition, although he knew me well.",

Mr. Baron then read the following letter:\n\n\"William Henry Harrison, Governor and Commander-in-chief of the Territory of Indiana, to the Shawnee chief and the Indians assembled at Tippecanoe: Notwithstanding the improper language which you have used towards me, I will endeavor to open\nyour eyes to your true interests. Notwithstanding what white men have told you, I am not your personal enemy. You ought to know this from the manner in which I received and treated you on your visit to this place.\n\n\"Although I must say that you are an enemy to the Seventeen Fires, and that you have used the greatest exertions to lead them [the Indians] astray.",

I will immediately take means to send you, with those chiefs that you may choose, to the city where your father lives. Everything necessary shall be prepared for your journey, and means taken for your safe return.\"\n\nThe Prophet made no answer to this speech, but promised to send Tecumseh to visit the governor.\nMr. Baron had much conversation with Tecumseh, however. He said that he did not intend to make war, but he solemnly declared that it was impossible to remain friends with the United States unless they would give up the idea of making settlements further to the north and west, and would acknowledge the principle that the Western country was the common property of all Indian tribes.\n\n\"The Great Spirit,\" said Tecumseh, \"gave this great island to his red children; he placed the white on the other side of the big water.",

But Harrison had determined not to await Tecumseh's readiness.\nCHAPTER XXI.\n\nGETTING READY FOR WAR.\n\nIn a letter to the War Department with regard to this council, Governor Harrison speaks of \"the implicit obedience and respect which the followers of Tecumseh pay to him,\" as wonderful. He says: \"If it were not for the vicinity of the United States, he would perhaps be the founder of an empire that would rival in glory Mexico or Peru. No difficulties deter him. For four years he has been in constant motion.

Not being strong enough to risk a fight with the Indians, the remainder stopped within twenty-four miles of the fort, while Mr. Oliver, with the Indians, Logan, Captain Johnny, and Bright Horn, endeavored to reach the garrison. Within five miles of the fort, Logan discovered that there were holes dug along the roadside. These were used by the Indians in night watching, each hole being large enough to hold a man. Logan's party therefore left the road, and by another route rode to within half a mile of Fort Wayne.",
