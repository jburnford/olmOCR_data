Hoey\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI now wish to nominate Miss Mildred Hitchcock as teacher at the South School on Fort a la Corne Reserve. I have given Miss Hitchcock's qualifications in a previous letter, and I would like to add that she is most anxious to help in Indian work. I have every confidence that she would do good and faithful work on a reserve. I have not heard from you regarding the transfer of Mr. L. Ahenakew from the South School to the North School at Fort a la Corne and of course Miss Hitchcock's nomination is subject to your agreement of the proposed change.\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\n(Sgd.) Henry D. Saskatchewan.\nOttawa, July 17, 1945.\n\nMr. H.J. McLeod, Acting Indian Agent,\nDuck Lake, Sask.",
