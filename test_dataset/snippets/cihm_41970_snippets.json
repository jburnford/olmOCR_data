According to the practice which has always prevailed in Lower Canada, the Attorney General is charged with the duty of carrying on criminal prosecutions in the Courts of King's Bench, in the several districts of the Province; and upon the depositions put into his hands, before the opening of these Courts, he prepares the necessary indictments, which are in readiness to be preferred, as soon as the Court assembles.",

This duty was discharged by me, with perfect impartiality between the parties concerned.—The criminal court for the district of Three Rivers being held before that for the district of Quebec, the depositions to be acted on in the former district first received attention. By these it was substantiated, that one Charles McCarthy, a clerk of Mr. Lampson, with a party of men under his orders, had assaulted one Antoine Hamel, a clerk, and three hired men, in the service of the Hudson's Bay Company, while engaged in their trading pursuits, had made them prisoners, had taken them to several trading posts of Mr.",

It would have been highly desirable, in order to check effectually the disorders that gave occasion to these indictments, that the trials of them should have taken place, without delay.

In this Petition, Mr. Lampson, among various unfounded statements, calls the attention of His Excellency, in an especial manner, to the action of \"Réintégrande\" above-mentioned, as being \"a subject of vast importance to the just rights of the Crown, and worthy of His Excellency's most serious consideration. An action\" he proceeds to state, \"has lately been instituted by the Hudson's Bay Company, as lessees of Mille-Vaches, by the ministry of the Attorney-General, against your Petitioner and his servants, for supposed trespasses, near the River Portneuf, (the site in dispute,) to which both the Hudson's Bay Company and your Petitioner, as lessee of the King's Posts, lay claim: A copy of the Writ and Declaration served on your Petitioner, is herewith submitted; and your Petitioner, at the same time prays most humbly for the interference of the Crown, to afford him the necessary assistance to defend the said action.\" He proceeds further to state, \"The result of this action must be of the utmost importance to the Crown in this particular, that an extensive tract of valuable land will be wrested from the Crown, without title, should the lessees of Mille-Vaches, countenanced by the Attorney-General, succeed in the said action.\" The Petition concludes with the following remarkable paragraph:—\"That your Petitioner, in laying his claims before your Excellency, for mature consideration, cannot pass over in silence, but\nleur demande; n'ayant pas la moindre idée qu'en le faisant j'allais me rendre coupable aux yeux d'un Comité des Griefs de l'Assemblée du Bas-Canada, pour un acte que je considérais alors, et qu'il doit m'être permis de considérer encore, comme un des plus innocents de ma vie.",

Two other witnesses, the Hon. Mr. Primrose, and Captain Bayfield, were, indeed, examined before the Committee, but as to immaterial points; the former, as to his professional engagements to the Hudson's Bay Company, and the instances in which I acted professionally to that Company, and the latter, as to the geographical situation and extent of the Bay of Mille-Îles.",
