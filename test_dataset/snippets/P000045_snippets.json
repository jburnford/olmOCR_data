The rest were left unconfined; but a paddle was put into each of our hands, and we were made to use it. The Indians in the canoe were seven in number; the prisoners four. I had left, as it will be recollected, Major Etherington, Lieutenant Lesslie and Mr. Bostwick, at M. Langlade's, and was now joined in misery with Mr. Ezekiel Solomons, the soldier, and the Englishman who had newly arrived from Détroit. This was on the sixth day of June. The fort was taken on the fourth; I surrendered myself to Wenniway on the fifth; and this was the third day of our distress.\nWe were bound, as I have said, for the Isles du Castor, which lie in the mouth of Lake Michigan; and we should have crossed the lake, but that a thick fog came on, on account of which the Indians deemed it safer to keep the shore close under their lee.",

The Indian cry was made in the village; a general muster ordered; and, to the number of two hundred, they marched up to the fort, where the canoe was expected to land. The canoe, suspecting nothing, came boldly to the fort, where the passengers, as being English traders, were seized, dragged through the water, beat, reviled, marched to the prison-lodge, and there stripped of their clothes, and confined.\n\nOf the English traders that fell into the hands of the Indians, at the capture of the fort, Mr. Tracy was the only one who lost his life. Mr. Ezekiel Solomons and Mr. Henry Bostwick were taken by the Otawas, and, after the peace, carried down to Montréal, and there ransomed.",

To return to Michilimackinac could only ensure my destruction; and to remain at the island was to brave almost equal danger, since it lay in the direct route between the fort\nand the Mississaki, along which the Indians from Detroit were hourly expected to pass, on the business of their mission. I doubted not, but, taking advantage of the solitary situation of the family, they would carry into execution their design of killing me.\nCHAPTER XX.\n\nAuthor is again relieved—takes leave of Wawatam and his Family—is hospitably received by M. Cadotte, at the Sault de Sainte-Marie—pursued by the Indians. Embassy from Sir William Johnson. Deputation to Sir William—Author to accompany it. Great Turtle to be consulted.\n\nUNABLE therefore to take any part in the direction of our course, but a prey at the same time to the most anxious thoughts as to my own condition, I passed all the day on the highest part, to which I could climb, of a tall tree, and whence the lake, on both sides of the island, lay open to my view.",

At Fort Niagara, he had seen no great number of soldiers; but, on descending the Saint Lawrence, as low as Montréal, he had found the river covered with boats, and the boats filled with soldiers, in number like the leaves of the\ntrees. He had met them on their way up the river, coming to make war upon the Indians.\n\nThe chief had a third question to propose, and the spirit, without a fresh journey to Fort Niagara, was able to give it an instant and most favourable answer: \"If,\" said the chief, \"the Indians visit Sir William Johnson, will they be received as friends?\"\n\n\"Sir William Johnson,\" said the spirit, (and after the spirit, the priest,) \"Sir William Johnson will fill their canoes with presents; with blankets, kettles, guns, gun-powder and shot, and large barrels of rum, such as the stoutest of the Indians will not be able to lift; and every man will return in safety to his family.\"\n\nAt this, the transport was universal; and, amid the clapping of hands, a hundred voices exclaimed, \"I will go, too!",

On informing them of our condition, they supplied us with as many fish as we were willing to accept; and no sooner were we possessed of this treasure, than we put ashore, made a fire, and refreshed ourselves with a plentiful breakfast.

We passed the winter together at the Sault de Sainte-Marie, and built a barge, fit for the navigation of the lake; at the same time laying the keel of a sloop of forty tons. Early in May, 1771, the lake becoming navigable, we departed from Point aux Pins, our ship-yard, at which there is a safe harbour, and of which the distance from the Sault is three leagues.

This house had been built the year before, by Mr. Hearne, who was now absent, on his well-known journey of discovery. We found it garrisoned by Highlanders, from the Orkney Islands, and under the command of a Mr. Cockings, by whom, though unwelcome guests, we were treated with much civility.

The uplands have a growth of small pine-trees, and the valleys, of birch and spruce.

Their solicitude and credulity, as to drugs and nostrums, had exposed them to gross deceptions, on the part of the agents of the Hudson's Bay Company. One of the chiefs informed me, that he had been at the Bay the year before, and there purchased a quantity of medicines, which he would allow me to inspect. Accordingly, he brought a bag, containing numerous small papers, in which I found lumps of white sugar, grains of coffee, pepper, allspice, cloves, tea, nutmegs, ginger and other things of this kind, sold as specifics against evil spirits, and against the dangers of battle; as giving power over enemies, and particularly the white bear, of which the Indians in these latitudes are much afraid:—others were infallible\n\n* See page 249.\nagainst barrenness in women; against difficult labours; and against a variety of other afflictions.",
