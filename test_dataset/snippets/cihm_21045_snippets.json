The few harbors along its whole range, are of very limited capacity. The coal, gypsum, and other minerals, abounding here, are probably of the same strata with those in Cape Breton, as they appear in the same direct line.\n\nThe soil of the interior is generally of a good quality: a great portion of it, free of stone, is easily tilled, and very productive. The forests are composed of Beech; Elm; Oak; black, white, and yellow Birch; Maple; white, prickly, and black Ash; pitch, white, and yellow Pine; white, black, and red Spruce; Larch; Hakmetak, or Juniper; Hemlock; and Fir.\n\nThe temperature, or rather intemperature, is the most equivocal of any part of the world.",

Des Barres, in attaching to them the names of noblemen, or men in power, has made his charts of less value; and in one or two instances, has created serious blunders. Inquire of the people of Jedore for Port Egmont, or those of Sheet Harbor for Port North, they know them not, nor would they ever be induced to adopt them. Jestico, a harsh, unpleasant, and unmeaning name, is preferred to Port Hood, although the latter is more pleasing to the ear, and pronounced and recollected with ease: all attempts\nto change the rude Indian names for others of a finer texture have failed; even New Jerusalem and Acadia, have expired.",

When arrived at Sandwich Point, which is bold, keep Chebucto Head in sight, by not allowing it to shut in. This plain mark will lead in the fair way home to George's Island, leaving Point Pleasant shoals on the left, and McNab's shoal on the right: round the Island either side, and anchor where you please, in 6, 10, or 13 fathoms, muddy bottom.",

In a few hours the fragment of her crew consisted of thirteen persons, one of whom, Mr. Galvin, a master's mate, was the unfortunate cause of the disaster.

In a letter to Sir Joseph Banks, he says, \"I observed on my last voyage (1817) about two thousand square leagues (18,000 square miles,) of the surface of the Greenland Seas, included between the parallels 74° and 80°, perfectly void of ice, all of which has disappeared within the last five years,\" and he further states, that though on former voyages, he had very rarely been able to penetrate the ice, between the latitudes of 76° and 80°, so far to the West as the meridian of Greenwich, 'on his last voyage he twice reached the longitude of 10° West,' that in the parallel of 74°, he approached the coast of Old Greenland; there was little ice near the\nland; and adding, 'that there could be no doubt but he might have reached the shore had he had a justifiable motive for navigating an unknown sea at so late a season of the year.' He also found the sea so clear in returni... to the southward, that he actually landed on Jan Mayen's Island, which is usually surrounded with a barrier of ice, and brought away specimens of the rocks.",

The most intelligent travellers, who, in our time, have visited this island, bear testimony to the fact of large logs of wood being dug out of bogs, and found between the rocks and in the valleys. It is also said that good culinary vegetables were once produced on it; but the cabbages seen there by Mr. Hooker, in the month of August were so diminutive that a half crown piece would have covered the whole plant. Nothing but a deterioration of climate could have wrought these changes; and this can only be\nexplained by the vast increase of floating ice, 'which,' says Hooker, 'not only fills all the bays, but covers the sea to that extent from the shore, that the eye cannot trace its boundary from the summit of the highest mountains.' Sometimes it connects the island in one continued mass with Greenland, when the white bears come over in such alarming numbers, that the inhabitants assemble and wage a national war against them.",

The colony on the West side of Old Greenland increased to four parishes, containing one hundred villages; but being engaged in perpetual hostility with the Esquimaux, the whole were ultimately destroyed by them. The ruins of some of the edifices were still visible in 1721, when that pious and amiable man, Hans Egede, went out with his whole family to settle there, on the re-establishment of a colony on that coast by the Greenland Company of Bergen in Norway. It still exists, and the population, taken but imperfectly in 1802, was found to amount to 5,621 souls; and we have since learnt that, including the Moravian establishments and the natives, who have mostly been converted to Christianity, the total population of the western coast of Greenland may now be estimated at not less than 20,000.",

He thinks, however, that, partly by the change of the government in Queen Margaret's reign, and partly from the continual wars which ensued between the Danes and the Swedes, the Greenland colonists may have been neglected; for it does not appear that any steps were taken for a century, after the unsuccessful attempts of the bishop to land, when the Christians and the Fredericks, calling to mind these remote and long-neglected\npossessions, took measures for inquiring into the fate of their unfortunate subjects.",
