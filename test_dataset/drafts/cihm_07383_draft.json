They were all taken as secretly and suddenly as Kaskaskia, and the power of Great Britain was entirely broken in the Mississippi River country, by the sudden onslaught of a few hundred men.\n\nWinning the favor of the French at Kaskaskia by kindness and shrewd management, Clark got them to take the oath of allegiance to the United States. Then he dispatched a friendly priest, Father Gibault, to sound the people at Vincennes, an old French settlement on the Wabash which had become a British post, and which now lay between Clark and the American settlements.",

This occupation he carried on more as pastime than as business. It is said of him, on the authority of those captives and half-breeds who knew him well, that he was not avaricious, but that his generosity was proverbial. The furs that he caught or the goods acquired by exchange were dispensed with a bountiful hand. He did not hunt for the purpose of bettering his fortunes, but from love for it as a manly and soldierly employment, and as a means of furnishing food to those who were not able to hunt for themselves.",

An Indian agent, Mr. Jouett, wrote to the governor that he feared this meeting would result in some\nhostile movement on the frontier, and advised that the Prophet should be seized and imprisoned, in order to extinguish his influence. General Harrison rejected this proposition, probably because so violent a measure would have precipitated hostilities with Tecumseh's band.\n\nThe Pottawatomies and Kickapoos granted Tecumseh and the Prophet a tract of land on the Tippecanoe, one of the tributaries of the Wabash River. To this place, in the western part of what is now the State of Indiana, Tecumseh and the Prophet, with their party, started to remove in the spring of 1808, much to the relief, no doubt, of their civilized neighbors in Ohio.",

He came upon the six warriors, who were headed, it is believed, by the chief Roundhead, seated in council in a grove of sugar maples a short distance from Leatherlips' lodge. The old chief, with his arms tied with a slight cord, sat calmly in their midst. A few white neighbors were also present, and a sullen and gloomy Indian, who had been Leatherlips' companion, sat apart in the camp.

They had indeed arrived at an opportune moment—an hour later would have been too late; and for many days previous it would have been impossible to reach the garrison through the Indian ranks.\n\nMr. Oliver now wrote a hurried despatch to Worthington, and the brave Logan and his men, with new rifles, prepared for fresh perils. They took the letter and started from the gate of the fort. They were immediately seen by the savages, who pursued the flying scouts. The race was eagerly watched by the garrison. As they crossed the enemy's line in safety,\nLogan gave a triumphant shout, which reached the ears of the anxious soldiers in the fort.",
