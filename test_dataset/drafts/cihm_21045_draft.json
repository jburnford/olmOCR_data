The few harbors along its whole range, are of very limited capacity. The coal, gypsum, and other minerals, abounding here, are probably of the same strata with those in Cape Breton, as they appear in the same direct line.\n\nThe soil of the interior is generally of a good quality: a great portion of it, free of stone, is easily tilled, and very productive. The forests are composed of Beech; Elm; Oak; black, white, and yellow Birch; Maple; white, prickly, and black Ash; pitch, white, and yellow Pine; white, black, and red Spruce; Larch; Hakmetak, or Juniper; Hemlock; and Fir.\n\nThe temperature, or rather intemperature, is the most equivocal of any part of the world.",

From this period the settlement was almost derelict, till Governor Parr, in 1784, encouraged 20 families to remove hither from Nantucket, to carry on the South Sea fishery.",
