Some say that he went to the side of the wheel where there was a sort of a platform, and that if he was on the wrong side, then the platform must also be on the wrong side; again, others say that he went up on the right side by which access could be had to the wheel.\n\nWhatever story may be correct and at present we pass no opinion upon the subject, sufficient is known to show that there was abundant need for an investigation, whatever may have been the result. It is but fair to state, that the Chief Factor of the Hudson Bay Company, Hon. Lawrence Clarke, Esq., and Col. Richardson, who happened to be in town, immediately after the occurrence of his office as Superintendent, Macarthur holds the position of coroner in the North West Territories, and expressed his willingness to investigate the matter, if arrangements were made for it, as required.",

Mr. McKay undoubtedly the oldest settler on the Red River, having come to this country in 1823, when he was only 16 years of age, and been here ever since. His remains are the only history of this country are very interesting. He has lived through many changes, and his body, as we purpose spending an hour so with him tomorrow day in order to get a few facts regarding the early history of this country in its earlier days. We can imagine the old gentleman telling us of the adventures that took place, and how he will live to see more of them. On the morning of our visit to him, he was engaged in writing on a piece of paper, which he had placed on a table below, whilst his pipe was out, and his eyes and ears are fine and sharp.",
