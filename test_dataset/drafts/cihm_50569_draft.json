Hudson styled it emphatically the 'Great River,' or the 'Great River of the Mountains;' no doubt from the extraordinary circumstance of such a body of water flowing through the mountains without a cataract. The name of its discoverer, however, was early attached to it. I find it familiarly called Hudson's river, in some of the public documents of the Dutch colonial government; but more frequently the North river, to distinguish it from the Delaware, which was discovered by the same navigator, and which being within the territory claimed by the Dutch, was called by them the South river.\n\n\"The Dutch immediately began to avail themselves of the advantage which the discovery of Hudson presented to their view. In 1610, it appears that at least one ship was sent hither by the East India Company, for the purpose of trading in furs, which it is well known continued for a number of years to be the principal object of commercial attraction to this part of the new world.",

It was fortunately, however, firmly sustained by the proposer and his friends, and finally sanctioned upon the principle, 'that it could do no harm and might do some good.' But the joint committee, possessed in favor of the Oswego route, directed the surveyor-general to cause a survey of the rivers, streams, and waters in the usual route between Hudson river and Lake Erie, and such other route as he might deem proper; shifting to the surveyor-general the responsibility of countenancing a project deemed absurd.",

The government of the city was extremely rigid, and often cruel; it bore the character more of a military despotism than that of a civil police; heavy penalties were imposed for the least infraction of the laws regulating the trade with the Indians, and many families consequently ruined. This severity drove some of the \"traders\" to the Schenectady flats, where they intercepted a considerable portion of the fur on its way to Albany, and which occasioned for many years the most bitter animosities between the inhabitants of both places. The circulating medium then in use consisted principally of sewant, or wampum.\n\nMinisters of the reformed religion were regularly sent out from Holland to the colony. In 1657, the Rev. Gideon Schaats sailed from Amsterdam for this colony, and about the same time the Dutch West India Company wrote a letter, stating that they would send a bell and a pulpit, \"for the inhabitants of Fort Orange, and of the village of Beaverwick, for their newly constructed little church.\" In\n\n---\n\n* These palisades consisted of large pieces of timber in close contact with each other, driven endwise into the ground, and gates or openings were made at suitable intervals, which were closed at night.\non this foundation they raised a larger structure.",

Preparatory to the war of 1812, there were erected very efficient and extensive fortifications, known as forts Tompkins, Richmond, and Hudson, at the Narrows, opposite to Fort Fayette, on Long Island. These forts completely protect the strait, which is but one mile wide. Upon Signal Hill, back of the forts, overlooking the harbor, Sandy Hook, and a great extent of sea, is a telegraph communicating with the city. Staten Island was purchased from the Indians for Michael Pauw, one of the directors of the West India Company, together with an extensive tract in Bergen county in New Jersey, by deed dated August 10, 1630, and the whole tract received the name of Pavonia.",
