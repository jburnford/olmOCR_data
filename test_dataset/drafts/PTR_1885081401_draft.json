This entertainment turned out a complete success, and Mr. H. B. Co. Wingfield made a most happy impression upon those who had the honor of making his acquaintance for the first time. An interesting feature of the occasion was the appearance of Messrs. Munro and Quinn, the Government Commissioners who have come to inquire into the claims of those who have suffered loss in consequence of the late rebellion. We regretted not having known of this before making some remarks which appear in our last issue.",

We were delighted with the way in which he explained the public sentiment of Quebec with regard to the unfortunate rebellion.\n\nWe learn from reliable sources that the distress at Dartmouth has been considerably exaggerated when reported, and that all cases of real necessity have been attended to by direction of the Government. If we have not been giving the Government credit for such discretion as it has already been making it is only because we have been kept in the dark with regard to their proceedings.\n\nCOMMUNICATIONS.\n\nWHAT WAS IT?\n\nTo the Editor of The Times,\n\nSir,—Last Friday night about eleven o'clock there was seen a bright light rising up from the summit of the hill.",
