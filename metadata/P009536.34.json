These original reports do not appear to be the product of any specific agency as the Department of Public Works of the North-west Territories is not formally constituted until 1897. From 1898 to 1905, issued by the Department of Public Works of the North-west Territories under the title &lt;i&gt;Annual report of the Department of Public Works of the North-west Territories&lt;/i&gt;.  [public]: Following the entry of Alberta and Saskatchewan into Confederation in 1905, the publication is continued, in part, by reports from similar departments established in the new provinces. The 1905 report of the Territorial department contains the report for the newly formed Alberta department for September to December of that year. These new provincial reports - Alberta Department of Public Works, &lt;i&gt;Annual report of the Department of Public Works of the Province of Alberta&lt;/i&gt;, Edmonton: Department of Public Works of the Province of Alberta, 1906-1971 and Saskatchewan Department of Public Works, &lt;i&gt;Annual report&lt;/i&gt;, Regina: Saskatchewan Department of Public Works, [1908?]-1972 - are described separately in the bibliography.
