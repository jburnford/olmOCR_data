  "description": "Ord, Lewis Redman: 1856-1942. Engaged in western topographical survey, 1874-1912, except for 1889-1899; engaged in surveying for the CPR, 1886-1888; organizer of the Dominion Land Surveyors Corps during Saskatchewan Rebellion, 1885; moved to Ontario, 1912 (Association of Ontario Land Surveyors, <i>Annual report</i>, 1943, page 111). // Also published as <i>Reminiscences of a bungle, and two other Northwest Rebellion diaries </i>, edited and with an introduction by R.C. Macleod, Edmonton: University of Alberta Press, 1983 (xlviii, 323p.). The \"bungler\" was one of the land surveyors who joined the Dominion Land Surveyors Intelligence Corps. J.L. Doupe, who presented a copy to the Manitoba Legislative Library, attributed this to Lewis R. Ord; F. Anderson, a student of the Riel Rebellion, stated the author was T.S. Russell. Whoever he was, the author wrote with great sarcasm and was critical of the generalship in the campaign.",
