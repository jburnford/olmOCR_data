  "notes": "Irregular. Began publication in 1889 or 1890; ceased with vol. 5, no. 23 (Nov. 24, 1893). -- Place of publication printed as: Moose Jaw, N.W.T. (Saskatchewan was not officially recognized as a province until 1905). -- \"Historical directory of Saskatchewan newspapers, 1878-1983\" documents the \"Moose Jaw Times-Herald\" as having begun publication in April 1889. However, randomly checked digitized issues from Jan. 10, 1890-Nov. 24, 1893 all show \"The Times\" as the masthead title.\n",
