However, something must be done if the school is to remain open this winter, and what this should be is hard to say.\n\nI would like, before making any definite recommendation to have an Inspector, or go myself and see what is required. It might be well however, for the Department to set aside an appropriation of money and when the Inspector goes over he could just authorize what he thought was absolutely necessary, keeping within the amount set aside by the Department for the purpose of repairing the School. Perhaps $1500.00 or $2000.00 would be sufficient.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.M. GRAHAM,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nDuncan C.

As suggested by you, the Inspector should visit the school and ascertain what repairs are the most urgent, and arrange to have the work done. Arrangements should also be made for the purchase of the material required, and for the labour in carrying out the work. Competitive prices should be obtained in the purchase of all material. The expenditure incurred should not exceed the above authorized amount.\n\nThese repairs should be completed, if possible, during the summer vacation, and can be carried out under the supervision of the Agent.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

Arthur, Ind. Agt., Brocket, Alta., for Supplies and work on repairs to C of E School.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. 406-14 A dated June 28/22.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nToronto, Ontario, Jan. 15th 1923,\n41-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave., Winnipeg, Man.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nDuring my recent visit to the Victoria Home on the Pelican Reserve at Brocket, Alta., it gave me pleasure to observe the improvement made, since my previous visit, in the school building through repairs effected, especially to the floors and the walls. As practically all of these repairs were carried out by the School Staff, skilled workers being engaged for only one or two days on the roof, it was impossible for the staff to complete the painting which was authorized, and the paint provided, before the winter set in, but this will be undertaken by them during the coming Spring.\n\nDuring my visit there, which took place on January 3 and 4, I found the building exceedingly cold, and our staff, now one of the best at any of our schools, still in need of a few inexpensive articles of equipment which would add greatly to their comfort and so that of the children. I talked the situation over with Mr. Arthur, the acting Indian Agent, and Mr. Roe, the acting Principal, and informed them that I would request your Department to come to our assistance in providing the following:\n\n1. Storm windows for the central part of the main building. If these could be of the French pattern and fixed permanently on the inside, they would not only help to keep out the cold in winter, but the dust in summer.\n\n2. A Bath-Room. It appeared to me that the porch over the rear entrance might be raised and made into a bath-room for the staff at comparatively little cost.\n\n3. A New Well. The present well under the school building was made, I learned, simply by driving a pipe into the ground. The water appears to be very good, but it is not very plentiful and has at times to be supplemented from other sources. The installation of a bath, along with the\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nprovision of a better water supply for laundry purposes, would demand the sinking of a good well. This should not be very expensive, but great care would have to be taken in the selection of the spot, owing to the position occupied by some of the out buildings including the W.C.'s in years gone by.\n\n4. A Force Pump.\n\n5. A chemically sanitary closet for use in the winter months or in case of sickness.\n\n6. A Cupboard for the Kitchen.\n\n7. An upstairs verandah in the front of the building.\n\nIt was estimated that the total cost of providing all the above items would not exceed $1,000., and unless your Department is prepared to provide a new school to take the place of this one during the coming summer, or not later than next year, I shall be obliged if you will give the above items your earliest and most favourable consideration.\n\nWhen provided they will not by any means render the building fit for occupation for any protracted period, but will enable our staff to carry on for a year or two at the most.\n\nBelieve me, Sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary and Acting General\nSecretary M.S.O.C.\n\nTERW/FEC.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6369, file 763-5, part 2)\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nCANADA\n\nOttawa, Jan. 23, 1923.\n\nMemorandum.\n\nMr. Scott:\n\nRev. Dr. Westgate has recently visited the Peigan C. of E. Boarding School, and he now informs the Department that more repairs are needed if it is the intention of the Department to make no provision for a new building within the next two or three years. This building was in very bad condition at the time of my visit in 1921, and the request of the Field Secretary is reasonable.\n\nThe alterations and equipment suggested are as follows:\n\n1. Storm windows,\n2. Staff bath room,\n3. A new well,\n4. Force pump,\n5. Chemical sanitary closet,\n6. Kitchen cupboard,\n7. A front balcony.\n\nDr. Westgate estimates a total cost of $1,000, but I am of the opinion that more would be needed.\n\nI wish to recommend that the first six items be allowed. The building is so old that I cannot recommend the erection of a balcony.\n\nNo special provision has been made in the Main Estimates for this institution, but I believe funds could be found.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, Jan. 23, 1923.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, with reference to certain repairs and equipment needed at the Peigan C. E. Boarding School.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that this matter has been brought to the attention of the Deputy Superintendent General and he is disposed to give favourable consideration to your request, with the exception, however, of the balcony for the front of the school. It is considered that the condition of the building is such that an addition of this type is hardly warranted. Before authority is given, however, I shall be pleased to have more definite information concerning the cost of having the storm windows put on the central portion of the building and of having a staff bathroom built over the rear entrance. You might secure prices also, on the well that is proposed and the kitchen cupboard. Further, please indicate the type of force pump and sanitary closet required.\n\nIf the expenses in this connection are reasonable, and if funds can be found for the purpose, the necessary authority will be given.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Dr. Westgate, Field Secretary & Acting General Secretary, M.S.C.C., who visited the Peigan Church of England Boarding School early in January last, drew the attention of the Department to the need of certain repairs and equipment. In a recent letter he furnished an estimate of the cost. The Department has approved the supplying of the equipment and the installation of the same, as follows:\n\n- Bath - Steel, White Enamel Paint & Fittings $25.00\n- Bath Room Soil Pipe - 360 Ft. $99.00\n- Installation $25.75\n- Storm Sashes 18 @ $3.50 $63.00\n- Kitonen Cupboard Lumber for same $25.00\n- Well, Force Pump (single-action) and Pipe, Lumber $36.25\n- Sanitary Chemical Closet, Chemical & Vent Pipe $14.00\n- Lumber - Repairing Balcony $20.00\n\nTotal Estimated Cost ... $310.00\n\nI have, therefore, to request that you will arrange for the purchase of the above supplies and have them delivered to the school. It will be necessary before making the purchase to obtain competitive prices from a number of dealers, and the purchase in each case should be made from the firm quoting you the lowest price. The total cost should not exceed the sum of $325.00.\n\nRegarding the fitting up of a bathroom for the staff, the Principal considers that the small room at the back of the boys' day room could be utilized for this purpose, as it would save labour and the cost of material in having the bathroom built over the porch at the rear entrance. Any labour required in installing the above equipment may be performed as far as possible by the staff, but, if necessary to engage the services of skilled labour in fitting up the bathroom, etc., you may engage the same. However, no undue expenditure for this purpose should be incurred.\n\nWhen these supplies have been purchased by you, and the work has been performed, you should forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred, to which you should attach an abstract of the prices received, and the names of the firms asked to quote.\n\nDr. A. Arthur, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBrocket, Alta.\n\nIndian Affairs, (RG 10, Volume 6369, file 763-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nWe are informing Rev.

Deputy & Secretary.\nOttawa, March 12th, 1923.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 7th instant, in reply to ours of the 23rd January, last, enclosing an estimate prepared by the Principal of the cost of the repairs and equipment required at the Peigan Church or England Boarding School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that we are authorizing Mr. Agent Arthur, Brocket, Alta., to purchase the equipment mentioned in the Principal's letter to you, including lumber to the amount of $20.00 in making certain repairs to the balcony, and to arrange for any necessary skilled labour in having the work done.\n\nWe hope that, when this equipment has been provided and installed, it will place the building in a sufficiently suitable condition to meet the requirements until such time as a new school can be erected.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

A cheap laundry and equipment (not power).\n   - 2 washing machines,\n   - 2 wringers,\n   - 1 mangle,\n   - 2 - 10 gallon copper boilers,\n   - 2 tubs, to be connected with present drain pipe.\n\n2. A hen house.\n3. A horse and buggy.\n4. An extra quarter section of land.\n5. Increase pupilage to 40.\n\nI suggested to Dr. Westgate that they write regarding the pupilage and have the Principal take up with the agent the matter of extra acreage.\n\nWith reference to the additions and replacements to plant, it was suggested that they recommend improvements with estimates, up to $1,000. The Deputy instructed me to give favourable consideration.\nToronto, Ontario, June 18, 1923,\n41-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave., Winnipeg, Man.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Principals of a number of our Indian Boarding Schools are finding that a refrigerator is a very necessary part of the school's equipment, and are asking our Society to provide the same. In reply I am informing them that our Society is financially unable to furnish this item of furniture, but that I would lay the matter before your Department.\n\nI shall be glad, therefore, if you will let me know if you will sanction the purchasing of refrigerators for our Peigan and Onion Lake Schools. It is estimated that the cost of each refrigerator would not exceed, including freight charges, $40.00.\n\nBelieve me, Sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.B.C.G.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6369, file 765-5, part 2)\nOttawa, June 22, 1923.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant, in which you request the Department to purchase refrigerators for the Peigan and Onion Lake C. of E. Indian Residential Schools. I have noted that the cost of this equipment will not exceed $40.00.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that the Department has given favourable consideration to your request, and we are directing the respective agents to purchase this equipment in the case of the Peigan and Onion Lake Institutions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D. D.,\nField Secretary, M. S. C. C.,\n41 - 43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOttawa, June 22, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada has requested that the Department purchase a refrigerator for the Beigan C. of E. Indian Boarding School. Will you, after communicating with the Principal concerning the type desired, arrange for the purchase of a refrigerator for the use of the school. Competitive prices must be secured, and when you forward the vouchers, you should attach an abstract of tenders showing the firms asked to quote and the prices quoted. The Department considers that a refrigerator valued $40 would be suitable for the purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nC. A. Arthur, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBrocket, Alta.\nSir,\n\nThe principal of the C.of E. school for this reserve has advised me that he has been instructed by the Rev. Dr. Westgate to apply for the building of a laundry for the use of the school, and has asked me to recommend that the department authorize the building of the same.\n\nThe letter to the Principal also states that an unofficial undertaking has been given that the department will spend $1000.00 for this purpose and advises the requisitioning of $1500.00 for this and other repairs to the school.\n\nI have no information from the department as to what their policy is in regard to this school, but I have been informed from sources connected with the C.of E. that the building of a new school on this reserve for the C.of E. was under advisement and in all probability would be built in a very few years.\n\nThere is absolutely no question as to the need of a suitable laundry building for this school and it is only a question of how long this present building will remain in use.\n\nFor your information I would say that the present room used as a school room has cubic feet of air space for only fourteen or fifteen children and the average attendance is around thirty. This room also was built for a laundry but was converted into a school room while a suitable building for use as a school remains idle, situated only a few feet away from the present building and used at rare intervals as a church. I have been informed that the ownership of this church rests with the diocese of Calgary and for some obscure reason cannot be used as a school.\n\nLooking at this from a business point of view I cannot recommend the expenditure between $1100.00 and $1200.00 for a new laundry building before an attempt has been made to acquire this church to use as a school room. This will effect a vast improvement in the sanitary conditions of the school.\nby providing an increased amount of air space for the children and will at the same time provide a suitable laundry by the vacating of the present school room.\n\nIn this way the department will be saved what might prove a useless expenditure in a few years and improve the conditions now obtaining at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDep't of Indian affairs.\nOttawa, Canada.\nOttawa, July 25, 1923.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have to refer to certain requests made upon the occasion of your last visit to Ottawa, in connection with the Peigan C. of E. Indian Boarding School. The most important matter brought to our attention was the provision of a small laundry and certain equipment for it.\n\nI have to inform you that we have had some correspondence with our representative, in this connection, and he is of the opinion that the room used at present as a classroom is entirely too small for the present purposes. There is air space for but 15 children, and the Department understands the average attendance is nearly 30.\n\nI have to request you to look into the possibility of utilizing the present school room as a laundry and making arrangements for the use of the chapel for classroom purposes. Our agent reports that this chapel, which is situated only a few feet from the present building, is only used at rare intervals as a church. He was informed that the chapel is under the control of the Diocesan authorities. I shall be pleased to learn whether, or not, arrangements can be made for the use of the chapel building as a classroom.\n\nLater, the provision of certain laundry equipment can be undertaken. As you were informed, the Department is favourably disposed to ameliorate conditions at the Peigan C. of E. Boarding School; but it is considered that whatever buildings are at present available should be fully utilized before any construction is contemplated. This institution, as you are aware, cannot be carried on under the present conditions for any length of time, and the Department hesitates to make any major improvements to plant.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Indian Boarding School. I have noted your recommendation that the church authorities be asked to allow the chapel to be used as a classroom. It is understood that this would release the present school room for laundry purposes.\n\nIn reply I beg to state this suggestion is being made to Dr. Westgate, Field Secretary of the M. S. C.

Indian Boarding School.\n\nIn reply to your letter of July 25th #116-1-5, which awaited me on my return from a visit to our school at Hay River in the N.W.T. I beg to state\u2014\n\n1. Better Laundry facilities for our Piegan School are indispensably necessary.\n\n2. That the Church which is situated by the school, being the property of the Diocese of Calgary and a consecrated building is not available for use as a class-room.\n\n3. That the present class-room, although not as large as it should be for the purpose for which it is being used, may safely be utilized for that purpose for another year.\n\nTo build a new class-room which would be warm enough throughout the winter months would cost a great deal more than to build a Laundry which would not require to be heated every day and I would respectfully suggest that the best and most economical solution of the difficulty at this school is to have a new Laundry building erected and furnished with some inexpensive laundry equipment such as hand-worked washing machines, wringers, etc.\nI have not had time since my return from the Far North to go carefully into the question of the cost, but I feel quite certain that it could be met by the sum of $1,500. This would enable the School authorities to erect a building of such a size and nature that it could be moved to the site of the new school when it has been provided on the Reserve and utilized as a work shop, wood shed or for some other useful purpose. As the building season is rapidly passing I shall be obliged if you will let me know if expenditure to this amount is authorized and if you will kindly instruct your agent on the Piegan Reserve to take the matter in hand at once.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nSept. 12, 1923.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nHonourable Charles Stewart,\n\nThe Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada and local Department representatives have drawn my attention to the extreme desirability of providing, without delay, laundry facilities at the Peigan C. of R.

The school staff and the older boys could assist. If this arrangement is made and the Department supplies the materials, the cost of the building itself will be in the neighborhood of $1200, and the equipment for it, some $300.\n\nI should be pleased to have your authority to incur the expense.

The children seemed to be in the best of health and the building was quite comfortable. The only repairs that are necessary to the building at the present time should be made to the children's dining-room and the porch. About 600 feet of flooring is required for this purpose.\n\nThe sum of $200.00 was authorized last summer by the Department for painting the school. The paint was purchased, but the Principal claimed he did not have time to get the work done this fall; he would do so, however, first thing in the spring. There was sufficient money left over after purchasing the paint to buy the flooring material that is necessary, and the work will be done by the staff.\n\nI am of the opinion that both schools could have been painted outside this Fall, and I censured the Agent for not going on with this work as soon as the paint was purchased.\n| ARTICLES                  | FIRMS ASKED TO QUOTE | REMARKS |\n|--------------------------|----------------------|---------|\n| O.S. white paint         | G.F.

ARTHUR\nINDIAN AGENT\n\nTHE SECRETARY,\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS,\nOTTAWA, ONT.\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI regret to have to inform you that at 10 o'clock on Tuesday morning Nov. 16th, the small frame building used as a residence for the Principal at our Society's Peigan School was completely destroyed by fire with all the contents, including furniture, books, clothes, etc. The Principal estimates his loss at $500.00, none of which was covered by insurance. The Society's loss although considerably greater is covered by insurance to the extent of $500.00 only.\n\nAt the time of the fire the Rev. W. Barlow the Principal, was absent in Calgary having been asked to appear there by the Bishop of Calgary in order to receive his Lordship's license to officiate within his Diocese. He was advised by telegram of the fire and loss sustained, and immediately reported the same to me. As I left for Saskatoon, Onion Lake, and other points North and West very shortly after Mr. Barlow's message came to hand, I was unable to send you a written communication at that time.\n\nThe Principal received instructions to take up residence with his wife and daughter, in the main school building and as our Society has already made a special grant towards equipment, every effort will be make to continue the work under these conditions until the Spring\nand summer of next year when it is hoped and expected that a complete new school building will be provided.\n\nWith regard to the cause of the fire the Principal states that, so far as he can make out, it must have commenced with the kitchen stove, but is unable to explain how. His wife being Head Matron and Boys' Supervisor on the staff was on duty in the main school building at the time, a distance of about 100 yards away, and his daughter was with her. Before the fire was discovered it had taken so strong a hold on the building that nothing could have saved it.\n\nRegretting the loss sustained and the delay in furnishing you with this report,\n\nI remain, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFIELD SECRETARY M.S.C.C.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Indian Residential School has been destroyed by fire. I am very hopeful that Parliament will provide funds for the replacement of this institution as a whole and I trust that the recent loss will not too seriously inconvenience the work for the next few months.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

It is tough, durable, easy to apply, unaffected by dampness, cannot warp, shrink or sag when nailed or screwed.\n\nThe millions of tiny, sealed air-cells in Ten-Test Insulating Building Board resist the passage of heat, cold and noise as rubber resists that of electricity.\n\nTen-Test is made of the best grades of wood pulp fibre. Used in place of ordinary board sheathing there are no knot holes or cracks through which cold can penetrate. There is no wastage in applying Ten-Test to walls or roofs. Its cost is amazingly low. It outlasts the building.\n\nBecause\u2014\n\nTen-Test is the best insulation against cold and heat obtainable, in its form.\nTen-Test is sound deadening, and at the same time corrects acoustical faults.\nTen-Test will not warp, buckle, check, crack or chip at corners or edges.\nTen-Test will not expand or contract when in place.\nTen-Test is the most highly recommended base for plaster and stucco.\nTen-Test is fire resisting and moisture and damp proof.\nTen-Test strength and texture cannot be obtained in any other board.

It is used extensively as a plaster base, doing away with the necessity of lathing, and is an excellent Insulation against Heat, Cold and Noise. \"TEN-TEST\" may also be used as an ordinary wallboard and when kiln-dried or painted gives every appearance of a special plaster finish.\n\nIn preference to all similar wallboards, over 4,000,000 feet of TEN-TEST Solid Fibre Board was used in the Canadian Building at the British Empire Exhibition.\n\nIf you are interested in using Insulation for your buildings and would like sample and further particulars regarding \"TEN-TEST\", kindly drop me a line and I will be glad to give you any further information you may want to know.\n\nHoping that I may hear from you, I am,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nFRED M.

We notice by Trade Report that you are preparing plans for two Schools to be erected on the Peigan Reserve, Alberta, and would respectfully suggest that you give the matter of using a Hardwood Floor your serious consideration. Prices on \"SEAMAN KENT\" Hardwood Flooring are quite reasonable now, and when you figure up the extra wear a Hardwood Floor will give you as compared with other floors you will find that it is an economical floor and of course, there is no question about its advantages as regards cleanliness and looks. In buildings such as these, there would, no doubt, be no necessity of getting the best grade as No. 1 Grade or even No. 2 Grade of Maple Flooring makes a very satisfactory floor, and I may mention that our No. 2 Grade of Maple Flooring does not cost very much more than Edge Grain Fir, but at the same time you will appreciate that it will give considerable more service. A Hardwood floor would also make these buildings more sanitary and easier to keep clean.\n\nI may mention that I am carrying a complete stock of Hardwood Flooring in my Edmonton Warehouse and this Warehouse is kept Heated and if the Flooring is shipped direct from here to the job, when Ready, you will be assured of having a good floor. Insist, however, on getting \"SEAMAN KENT\" Hardwood Flooring - this is manufactured by Seaman Kent Co. Limited of Toronto, who specialize on the manufacture of Hardwood Flooring and their Flooring is \"CANADIAN MADE\".\n\nTaking everything into consideration such as service, sanitation, etc. I am sure it would pay you to specify \"SEAMAN KENT\" Hardwood Flooring in place of softwood even though you used the cheaper grade.\n\nTrusting that I may hear from you that you intend specifying Hardwood Flooring in these two buildings, I am,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nFRED M.

He proposes\ncoming again, with his outfit, within a fortnight.\n\nI took up with Mr.Graham the matter of his price\nof $825.50 for the suggested change in studding from 2x4 to\n2x6in outside walls and bearing partitions, and endeavoured\nto get him to lower his price. He contends that Mr.Scanlon\nis too low in quoting $430.00 for this change, and that his\nprice is based on the increase of 50% in the quantity of\nstudding, plates and girts in the walls affected; also extra\ncost in transportation and setting; and in cost of wider\nframes as quoted by his millwork people, and $38 extra for the\npainting of same. However, he promised to check over his\nfigures, and see if it is possible to lower his quotation.\n\nRegarding the proposed change in layout of floors,\nMr.Graham took with him the blue prints you sent me showing the\nchanges desired, and said he would wire me his quotation for\nsame within a day or two. He will also quote on the enlarged\ncoal bin, and extension to machinery room, at the same time. On\nreceiving these quotations I shall promptly advise you, and\nawait your instructions before giving orders for this work.\n\nI do not see in the plans or specifications any\nmention of a ceiling over the boiler room, and on mentioning\nthe subject to the contractors, they said they had not figured\non any ceiling for this room. I therefore deemed it best to\nsend you a wire, for in case of your wishing a laminated ceiling\nsuch as you have specified elsewhere, the contractors wish to\ninclude the necessary material in their lumber orders about to\nbe shipped. No doubt I shall hear from you promptly regarding this.\nIn the painting specifications provision does not seem to have been made for the painting of the metal ceilings throughout the school, and I should like you to let me know what is your wish in this respect. The contractors state that they have not included the painting of metal ceilings in their tenders.\n\nI enclose herewith the drainage plan of the R.C. School submitted by Mr. Scanlon's sub-contractors for the plumbing and heating (Marsh & Scott, of Moose Jaw). Please mark what changes, if any, you require, and return it to me. You will note that some changes are shown in basement toilets, in accordance with the request of the Reverend Fathers, but these changes are not yet authorized, nor have any orders been given for them. I shall deal with these proposed changes, and a few others asked for, in a separate letter.\n\nIf you have any extra plans & specifications which you can spare, I should much like an extra set, which would save my carrying the one set backwards and forwards between the two jobs.\n\nMr. Scanlon is getting well ahead with his contract. The excavation is finished, the footing trenches dug, and all is in readiness for the pouring of concrete as soon as a repair part is received for the mixer. About 220 yds. of gravel are hauled, also a car of cement, and lumber, and the temporary buildings are erected. The weather has been hot and dry during the past month, and rain is needed for the filling out of the crops.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Construction.\nI have today received a letter and telegram from Mr. H. Gardner Smith with reference to the necessary changes in the layout of the Peigan Church of England School to meet their requirements. The extra cost for these changes will be $965.00. This includes in addition to the rearrangement of the rooms the enlargement of the machinery room and coal bin, as was done in the case of the R.C. School. It is also thought necessary to increase the size of the outside studding from 2 x 4 to 2 x 6 on account of the exceedingly high winds which prevail at this point. The cost of this change will be $607.00. As these prices are fair and reasonable and the work necessary I would recommend that the changes be authorized.\n\nArchitect.\nThe Canadian Bank of Commerce\nMoose Jaw, Sask.\n29th July 1926.\n\nDuncan C.

Graham & Sons, Ltd., of Moose Jaw, Sask., the contractors for the above mentioned school, do not seem to be hurrying themselves in carrying forward their contract.\n\nOn July 8th I wired them asking when their principal proposed arriving on the ground, to which telegram I received a reply stating that they were awaiting the receipt of their signed contract from Ottawa before commencing. As the contractor for the R.C. School was getting ahead, I wired again on the 22nd ult., and received a reply that Mr. P.W. Graham would arrive at Brocket on the 26th July. I met him at the station at 6 A.M. and took him to the Anglican site. He spent two days in the locality, and I helped him stake out the site of the building.\n\nOn 27th July he sublet the excavation to the same local man who had done similar work at the R.C. site. This work is reported to be completed, and there matters stand at present. Mr. Graham returned to Moose Jaw on 27th.\n\nThere is nothing done on the Anglican site except the excavation for the basement. No gravel has yet been hauled, nor have any materials been delivered to the site. One workman that Mr. Graham left here presumably to look after things, reported to me today that he had advised Mr. Graham of the completion of the excavation, and that he had received a reply stating that Mr. Graham will be back here \"as soon as he can\".\n\nPossibly the contractors for this school will rush things when once they establish themselves on the ground, and thus make up for lost time. My only complaint is that the season is advancing, and it is doubly difficult to get good work done during inclement weather.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSgd. E. Gardner Smith,\nInspector of Construction.\nSir:-\n\nI beg to forward a report from the Inspector of Construction on the Church of England School that is being built on the Peigan Reserve, from which it would seem that the excavation has been completed but that no further work has been performed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

(RG 10, Volume 6369, file 763-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nDETAIL OF CORNICE\n\nPROTECTION WALL\n\nPEIGAN SCHOOL\n\nSEPT 4th 1926\nSir:\n\nWith regard to the tar and gravel roofing specified for these schools, I am strongly of the opinion that they will not withstand the heavy winds to which this locality is subject, for the following reasons:\n\nFirst, because there is not sufficient protection around the edges of the roof as shown on plan, which would result in wind damage before very long, and once a tar-and-gravel roof starts to go it is very difficult to hold it. The Architect shows a very good detail of a protection wall around the edge of the verandah roof, and if this detail (with slight modifications) were extended around the main roof, the weakness to which I refer would be overcome. I enclose a rough pencilled sketch of a roof finish that I think would meet the requirements. It is an adaptation of the veranda cornice and protection-wall prepared by the Architect, but with the two by fours carried right down and spiked to the rafters instead of resting on a plate, which change would give greater stability against the wind. This suggested change calls for considerably more woodwork, labour and sheet-metal than the cornice shown on plan, and the contractor asks $15.00 additional for making the change.\n\nSecondly, the roofing itself as specified will prove too light to successfully resist the high winds for any length of time, and I would suggest, in addition to what is called for in the specifications, a heavy pouring of pitch, into which there should be imbedded a heavy coating of gravel. This might consist of 50 lbs. of pitch and 400 lbs. of gravel per square as a final finish, and we should thus get the necessary weight to withstand the drawing and buckling tendency of the strong prevailing winds, which as you know, often blow with almost cyclonic force in this Chinook district. The contractor asks $375.00 additional to add the extra finish in the manner described, or a total of $890 for the alterations mentioned in the present paragraph, and the extra pitch and gravel. I might mention that the contractor (Mr. Scanlan) is also of the opinion that unless the suggested changes in the roof are made, trouble from wind will develop in a short time. The extra sum asked by him for the additional labour and materials involved does not seem excessive.\n\nAs the work on the R.C. School is advancing steadily, it is desirable that as early a decision as possible be made regarding the suggested changes in the roof.\n\nThe changes suggested for the roof of the R.C. School will apply also to the Anglican School, although the latter building is not yet started except for the excavation for the basement.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n(Sgd.)

Apart from letting a sub-contract for the excavating, and the hauling of some gravel by the Indians, nothing was done until the first week of September, although the contract was let in June, and not until the 14th instant was a start made at running the concrete footings. At the present time there is a small crew of about eight men at work, and the pouring of the concrete walls should be completed within a week. The work, no doubt, was delayed somewhat by inclement weather. The contractors, P. W.

The specifications are practically the same as was approved for the Old Sun's School, Crowfoot School, Gleichen Hospital, St. Paul's and St. Mary's Schools. In all cases, it has stood up well and has cost practically nothing for renewals and delivers water fully up to guarantee. Slight improvements have recently been added to the Hoosier Line, such as Cut Gears instead of cast ones, and an air intake valve is now supplied with the medium and smaller models. The pump will, of course, be driven by the same engine, that is yet to be decided upon, which will generate the electric current and run the laundry line shift, etc.\n\nThe tested capacity of this well is 1200 gals. per hour, and it is 127 ft. deep.\n\nI would be pleased to have your authority for this expenditure so that I may notify the contractor as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nW.

In a later Report (Sep't 19th) I again drew attention to the backward condition of this work. I also made reference to it in my general correspondence with the Indian Commissioner's office.\n\nMessrs P.W.Graham & Sons, Ltd. now have about 15 men at work. The concrete walls were being completed last night, and their foreman assures me that from now on rapid progress will be maintained.

Graham & Sons, Ltd., of Moose Jaw, Sask. the contractors for the above-mentioned school, do not seem to be hurrying themselves in carrying forward their contract.\n\nOn July 8th I wired them asking when their Principal proposed arriving on the ground, to which telegram I received a reply stating that they were awaiting the receipt of their signed contract from Ottawa before commencing.\n\nAs the contractor for the R.C. school was getting ahead, I wired again on the 22nd July, and received a reply that Mr. P.W. Graham would arrive at Brocket on 26th July. I met him at the station at 6 A.M. and drove him to the Anglican site. He spent two days in the locality, and I helped him stake out the position of the building.\n\nOn July 27th he sub-let the excavation to the same local man who had done similar work at the R.C. site. This work is reported to be completed, and there matters stand at present. Mr. Graham left for Moose Jaw on the 27th.\n\nThere is nothing done on the Anglican site except the excavation for the basement. No gravel has yet been hauled, nor have any materials been delivered to the site. One workman that Mr. Graham left here, presumably to look after things, reported to me today that he had advised Mr. Graham of the completion of the excavation, and that he had received a reply stating that Mr. Graham will be back here \"as soon as he can\".\n\nPossibly the contractors for this school will rush things when once they establish themselves on the ground, and thus make up for lost time. My only complaint is that the season is advancing, and it is doubly difficult to get good work done during inclement weather.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n(Sgd.) E.

Gardner Smith with a view to getting an estimate of the cost and beg to make the following recommendations:\n\n(1) The provision of a sink in the Principal's kitchen which, installed complete with hot and cold water, waste and vent would cost $88.00 or with the addition of a deep apron, a drain-board and back all in one piece - $159.50.\n\nI think the cost of this can be reduced by putting in a drain board of a less expensive type.\n\n(2) The enlargement of the Staff Dining room in the basement, which however will entail only the cost of an extra window at a figure of $24.00.\n\n(3) The placing of a range boiler in the kitchen of 80 gallon capacity installed complete, including connection to stove and with hot water line to the kitchen sink, at a cost of $143.00.\n\n(4) Providing Burlap in the stairways, halls and corridors at a cost of $366.25, or if the rear corridor of the basement is omitted and I do not think it is necessary there, the cost will be reduced to $338.75. This with the baseboard and moulding will give a four foot protection to the walls.\n\nI shall be glad to receive authority to incur the above named expenditures.\n\nMr. Gardner Smith reminds me that no provision is made in the Specifications for the painting of the metal ceilings in this school and has procured from the Contractor a price of $330.00 \"To paint all metal ceilings and cornices in two coats, using best White Lead and pure Linseed oil\". Will you please grant the necessary authority.\n\nIn another letter Mr. Gardner Smith asks if it is desired to anchor the brick chimney, pointing out that this will extend 32' above the roof of the rear extension. He then adds that it is unlikely that the chimney would blow down, even without anchors.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\neven without anchors and while I draw attention to Mr. Gardner Smith's remarks in this connection, I am not prepared to recommend the expenditure.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M.

(RG 10, Volume 6369, file 765-5, part 2)\nReport on Church of England School; Peigan Reserve\n\nDear Sir:\n\nDuring the past month good progress has been maintained by the contractors, Messrs P.W. Graham & Sons, Ltd., of Moose Jaw, in the construction of the above school.\n\nAs previously reported, the contractors allowed two months to elapse before putting a crew to work, and with the exception of the excavation which they had sub-let, nothing was done at the job until the first part of September. During the past six weeks a fair sized crew has been employed under an efficient foreman, and the contractors seem to be making serious effort to make up for lost time.\n\nThe main building is now about closed in, and today the roofing sub-contractor is putting on the paper, tar and gravel. As authorized by the Department, we are making the roof heavier than originally called for. We are laying an extra ply of heavy roofing felt, and applying a heavy pouring of asphalt pitch, into which a large quantity of screened gravel is being embedded; and in addition to this we have carried up a protection wall 18\" high around the edge of the roof, which will be flashed down over the turned-up roofing. By taking these precautions we should have a roof that will successfully withstand the heavy winds of the locality, and the sudden changes in climate.\n\nOn the whole there is not much ground for complaint over the quality of materials delivered. The lumber is largely spruce, supplied by McLaren Lumber Co. from their mills at Blairmore, Alta. I visited the mill in company with Inspector Christianson and Indian Agent Arthur, and looked over the stocks the Company proposed sending. I objected to some of the lumber, particularly the drop siding, and they promised to supply us with a better grade cut from special stock. It is impossible to get lumber from mountain mills entirely free from knots, but the drop siding is otherwise very good, and is the very best that can be procured from local sources. It is thoroughly seasoned, and I am hopeful that the knots will remain fast. This siding has all been primed by the painter, and is now\nbeing put in place by the carpenters. The millwork is being supplied by the Cranbrook Sash & Door Co. and so far is proving satisfactory. The window frames were primed at the factory. Slight mistakes were made in some of the details but are being rectified.\n\nThe general framing work has been well done, and we have used every precaution in bracing the building at all points. Diagonal bracing has been placed in all corners on all floors, and at other points where helpful in making the building rigid. The sub-floors have all been laid diagonally, and all openings are being properly trussed.\n\nThe plumbing and heating sub-contractors (Snyder & Co. of Calgary) now have men at work, the basement drains are laid, and the roughing-in for plumbing fixtures is being done on all floors. I expect to make a water-test on Monday of the drains, stacks and vents. The heating boiler is now on the site, but has not yet been admitted to the building. The radiators are also here and have been distributed throughout the main building, and the steam-fitters are running their various lines. The pressure-tanks for water supply, and the hot water storage tank, are expected during the coming week, and the pumping plant is expected shortly. On this job we have a peculiar condition to take care of in consequence of having a \"flowing well\", but shall adopt means of controlling this surplus water and turn it to advantage.\n\nThe interior outside walls of main building have been sheeted with shiplap in readiness for the \"house-line\" covering, and this insulation should add materially to the warmth of the finished structure. I expect the electrician next week to lay his conduits for the wiring.\n\nThe rear extension is not yet framed. The concrete work is done, but owing to shortage of materials the framing is being deferred. Except for the footings, the chimney is not started.\n\nThe septic tank is completed, and sewer line laid. I checked over the levels, and had to order some correction work. I shall check this again before the tiles are covered.\n\nThe weather during past month has been favourable and practically no time has been lost during this period.\n\nThe contractors are dilatory in placing Fire Insurance and I notified them that unless the Policy asked for reaches me by Monday I would ask the Department to withhold further payment.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nInspector of Construction.\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is the item, dated Nov.11th, \"Fare Calgary to Morley and return, $3.40\". I went to Calgary on that date to procure data and prices on Power and Lighting Plants suitable for the Peigan Schools. I had received an invitation to attend the official opening of the Morley Indian School on the 11th, and as I wished to look the building over again, particularly with regard to the Fire Escapes and Plumbing, I decided to combine business with pleasure, and attend the opening ceremony. As the train connections did not suit, and would have detained me overnight, I hired a car in Calgary, and drove my wife and daughter to the school opening, returning to Calgary the same afternoon. The hiring of this car cost me $13.50, the receipt for which is attached to my November vouchers. Thinking, perhaps, that it might be deemed irregular if I charged the hiring of this car to the Department, I hesitated to do so, and after thinking it over I decided to charge only the actual train fare of $3.10, and the difference of $10.40 I am absorbing myself.\n\nTrusting my action in this instance meets with the department's approval,\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nInspector of Construction.\nCERTIFICATE\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nCertificate No. 3.\n\nBrocket, Alberta, Dec. 6th, 1926.\n\nI hereby Certify that Messrs.

S. Lord, Principal of St. Cyprian School writes in part as follows:\n\n\"Some time ago Mr. Gardner Smith suggested to Commissioner Graham that on account of the high winds the high chimney at the new school ought to be anchored. The request was turned down. I was up there some days ago when the wind was moderately high, and the chimney was swaying visibly enough to crack the plaster on the wall at the junction between the frame and the brickwork, and one could feel, by putting a finger over the crack, the motion, about 1/16th of an inch. All chimneys are supposed to sway, but I am wondering whether these high winds do not create a situation out of the ordinary. It would not cost much to guy or anchor the chimney.\"\n\nIn view of the above information I shall be obliged if you will take whatever action you may consider necessary in this connection. As stated by the Principal, the cost of anchoring would not be very much and the additional strength which it would give to the chimney would be sufficient to make it secure against the strong winds which prevail in that part at times, and possibly prevent a collapse, which could not but be attended with very serious results.\n\nBelieve me Sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFIELD SECRETARY, M.S.C.C.\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 1C, Volume 6369, file 763-5, part 2)\nA start has been made in the erection of the garage authorized by the Department. This addition occupies the corner at the rear of the school, and will be lighted and heated from the school plants.\n\nThe additional millwork, consisting of tables, benches, pews, cupboards, shelving, etc., has not yet arrived. There seems to have been an unaccountably long delay on the part of the factory in filling the order, but I am advised the car is now being loaded and should be received in a day or two.\n\nFrom present indications the school people will be able to move into the new school about the first week in May.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Construction.\nIndian Office.\nBrocket, Alta. April 21st, 1927.\n\nThe Secretary.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe- C.of E.School; Pelican Reserve.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to advise you that I have today issued a seventh Certificate, for $454.00 to Messrs P.W.Graham & Sons, Ltd., the general contractors for the above building, in payment of 90% of the contract price, and in full payment of authorized extras to date.\n\nI enclose a copy of the contractors' 7th Progress Estimate, which shows how the amount of the Certificate is arrived at.\n\nRegarding Item 31, I might explain that we have had an unique problem in the controlling of the flowing well, and in the utilization of the surplus water. The water rises to the top of the casing and overflows at the rate of about 120 gals per hour. Under pumping, the water level drops to about 50' below grade, and remains at that level even when we are pumping at the rate of 1200 gals. per hour. In order to provide against the flooding of the pumping room we found it necessary to \"seal\" the well,- that is to make the top of the well where the working head is placed absolutely water-tight. This required the welding of a flange to the top of the casing, and setting a concrete base about 18\" above the floor level. A 2nd relief outlet is taken from the casing below the welded flange with two branches,-one to the trench outside the building leading to the barn water-trough; and the other to the room opposite the laundry to be used as a dairy, where we have placed a concrete vat, with overflow to a floor drain. The work was done by Mr.Snyder, the plumbing & heating sub-contractor, and the charge of $164.45 is for labour and material thus employed, and including 10% for the general contractor.\n\nI think the other items are self-explanatory, but if further explanation is desired I shall be pleased to furnish it.\n\nThe general contract for this building is practically completed, just a few days' work remaining to be done, and which is more than offset by work performed additional to the contract. The contractor requests that his deposit security be now released, as he wishes to use his funds for other tenders. I promised to bring his request to your attention, and to recommend the return of his deposit. The fire insurance of $40,000.00 expires at the end of this month, by which date I expect to accept the building on behalf of the Department.\nRe Equipment for the New Syrian School.\n\nThe undersigned directs my attention to the fact that a workshop has not been provided, and I beg to suggest that a new building be erected or that the lumber built up at the old site be fitted up for this purpose.\nOttawa, April 12, 1927.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI wish to refer to that portion of your letter of the 29th ultimo which has reference to a workshop for the St. Cyprian Indian Residential School. I regret that there are no funds for the purpose of erecting this building at the present time. The old laundry building has been reported on by Mr. Commissioner Graham as of no particular value and it was turned over to the Rev. Mr. Haynes for use at the mission. If you find that Rev. Mr. Haynes does not move this building and if you believe it is suitable for a workshop, you might let me have a recommendation in due course.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

I then asked the Commissioner through the Indian office here for the building which he granted, and I have made arrangements to have it moved as soon as the School is vacated.\"\n\nIn the light of the above information it is clear that the old laundry building can not be moved to the site of the new School and be utilized as a workshop.\n\nAs a workshop, however, is a necessity at this School I trust that funds may be available for the erection of this building in the near future.\n\nBelieve me, Sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Murray Orr Esq.\nArchitect.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe- St. Paul's School; Blood Reserve.\n\nDear Mr. Orr:\n\nThe matters pertaining to St. Paul's School which I discussed with you when in Ottawa consist as follows:\n\n1. St. Paul's Sewage System discharges in a shallow ravine, where it forms a pool, and offensive odours reach the school and playground.\n\n2. The well-water is strongly impregnated with deleterious matter resulting in the blocking of the cooling system of the power plant, and the hot water lines throughout the school. Also it cannot be used in the heating boilers, nor in the high-pressure steam boiler.\n\n3. A heavy-gauge boiler breeching is needed before the next heating season.\n\n4. The roof water from rear of school is discharging along the foundation walls, and will cause damage to the building.\n\nRegarding Item No. 1, on the 28th instant I called at the school, and surveyed a line of drain from the present outlet of the sewer to a point 750' away, which when completed will transfer the pool to where it can no longer give offense. The cost of this work should not exceed $100.00. This will be for an open trench running straight with the ravine, instead of the present winding, sluggish course, and it will average about 2\u00bd' in depth.\n\nBefore making a recommendation dealing with the water supply, I am awaiting the receipt of a letter from Mr. Chene, Departmental Engineer, which he promised to send me, giving data, costs, etc., of an approved water-softening system adapted to the needs of the school. I am in daily expectation of Mr. Chene's letter.\n\nI have asked Messrs Snyder & Co., of Calgary, for a quotation for supplying and installing a #10 gauge iron breeching, and insulating that portion of the laminated wood ceiling directly over the breeching. As soon as this is received, I will write you further on the subject.\n\nRegarding the roof water which at present discharges along the foundation walls at the rear of the school, and which threatens very serious damage to the building, this has caused\nmuch concern, and was more than anything else the reason for my going to Ottawa. Already we have foundation cracks resulting from this cause, and unless remedial measures are taken, I fear the ultimate ruining of this splendid building. I drew Commissioner Graham's attention to it time and again, but my letters and recommendations were consistently ignored, and the damage has been allowed to go on unchecked. Not being a technical man, I can only assume he did not appreciate the nature and extent of the threatening damage, nor my proposals for overcoming same. Early in the construction of the building I asked him for authority to conduct the water from the downspouts at rear of school (where the surrounding ground slopes to the building) by underground drains to discharge in the drain taking the laundry waste, which could have been done for $150.00 before the basement floors were laid, but he would not authorize the outlay. We now have to find less efficient and more expensive means for taking care of this water. At present after a heavy rain a miniature lake forms at rear of school, and gradually soaks away along the foundation walls, as already stated.\n\nIn order to take care of the roof water, I recommend that a length of iron sewer pipe be placed under each downspout, and then by means of vitrified tile drains, conduct the water to discharge in the main sewer beyond the septic tank. I hope within the next few days to send you a sketch of the proposed drains, with estimate of cost.\n\nIndian Agent Pugh was unable to go to St. Paul's School the day I was there, having been called to Lethbridge to attend a police court trial, and he has asked me to return next Thursday so that I may point out to him my various proposals. He also wishes my advice regarding the proposed completing of the attic of the main building. I shall therefore go again to St. Paul's School on Thursday, after which I hope to be ready to report to you fully concerning the proposals outlined, with estimates of cost.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nInspector of Construction.\nMay 13, 1927.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 1st instant, regarding certain work required at the St. Paul's Indian Residential School, you may arrange to have 750 feet of trench provided in order to carry away the discharge from the septic tank. It is noted that the cost of this work will be approximately $100.00.\n\nAs soon as I hear further from you with reference to the other items mentioned in your letter instructions will be sent you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.

Paget\nChief Accountant.\n\nThe Manager,\nThe Canadian Bank of Commerce,\nMoosejaw, Sask.\nDear Sir:\n\nThe general contract for this school was completed some weeks ago, and the school people moved into the new building on the 22nd of May.\n\nWork additional to the general contract has since been going on, principally the installing of the extra millwork consisting of shelving, cupboards, lockers, tables, benches, pews, etc. The millwork people seemed an unaccountably long time in making delivery of the required materials, and about six weeks elapsed after the placing of the order and the arrival of the goods. This work is now completed.\n\nThe erection of the Garage was finished a day or two ago, this work being much delayed by the incessant rains.\n\nThe outbuildings, consisting of the barn, implement shed and poultry house, were completed some time ago, including the painting of them.\n\nAt present the extra chimney authorized for the Principal's kitchen is now being built, and should be completed in a day or so if weather permits. It is raining again today.\n\nThe anchoring of the main chimney is being deferred until the roads permit gravel being hauled for the concrete anchorages. This work can be done by local help.\n\nThe carrying of water for the use of the live stock to a point as near as possible to the barn will be undertaken when fine weather returns, and the digging of the trench will be done by Indian labour. It is my intention to utilize the water from the flowing well for this service.\n\nI expect to issue the final Certificate to the contractor (Messrs P.W.Graham & Sons, Ltd) some time next week.\n\nLast Tuesday the school was visited by Bishop Sherman, and accompanying clergy, and the school chapel was dedicated.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nInspector of Construction.\nMOOSEJAW SASK 15\n\nDUNCAN C SCOTT\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER DEPT INDIAN AFFAIRS OTTAWA ONT\n\nURGENTLY AWAITING REMITTANCES FOR CHURCH OF ENGLAND SCHOOL PEIGAN\n\nRESERVE RETENTION CERTIFIED TO BE RELEASED BY INSPECTOR SMITH THIRTY DAYS FROM APRIL TWENTIETH STOP WAR BOND DEPOSIT FIFTY TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS STOP ALSO INTEREST ON WAR BONDS DUE MAY LAST ADVISE WHEN MAILING\n\nP W GRAHAM AND SONS LTD.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Graham & Sons Ltd.,\nContractors at Moose Jaw, Sask.\n\nThe above concern advised us under date of April 6th, 1927 that on July 26th, 1926 they had commenced the construction of certain buildings on the Peigan Reserve in Alberta, and which operations most certainly come within scope of the Workmen's Compensation Act of this Province and if any of their employees had been injured this Board would most certainly have been liable in the matter of compensation and medical service. The contractor is most seriously delinquent in reporting the commencement of his operations in this Province.\n\nThey have been assessed in the regular way and we have written to them several times pointing out the fact that such assessment still remains unpaid. May I hereunder quote Section 36 (2) of the Workmen's Compensation Act of this Province which reads as follows:\n\n\"Where any work within the scope of this Act is undertaken for any person, in this section referred to as the principal, by a contractor, it shall be the duty of the principal to see that any sum which the contractor or any sub-contractor is liable to contribute to the accident fund in respect of the work so undertaken is paid, and if any such principal fails to do so he shall be personally liable to pay it to the Board, and the Board shall have the like powers and be entitled to the like remedies for enforcing payment as it possesses or is entitled to in respect of an assessment.\"\n\nIn view of the foregoing will you therefore please refrain from making final settlement with P.W. Graham & Sons Ltd. until they have produced to you a certificate of clearance from this office, showing that all liabilities...\n\f\nJune 23, 1927.\n\nSirs,\n\nWith reference to your contract for the school on the Peigan Reserve, I would ask you to please forward me a certificate of clearance from the office of the Workmen's Compensation Board of Edmonton, covering the labour on this contract.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

June 21st, 1927.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe- C.of E.School; Peigan Reserve.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to advise you that I have today issued an eighth Certificate, for $3092.75, to Messrs P.W.Graham & Sons, Ltd., of Moose Jaw, Sask. in payment of the additional work performed in connection with their contract for the above school, as shown on the accompanying list. I am also enclosing a copy of my letter of today to this firm.\n\nIn Item #36, for additional millwork, etc., of $2317.75, I would say the contractors' original figure for the first list of millwork, etc., submitted on behalf of the Principal, amounted to approximately $3000.00, but in consequence of severe pruning and eliminations, this was reduced to the sum shown. When in Ottawa last April, Mr.Orr authorized the restoring of some of the items which had been cut out in the effort to reduce the total price, and these will appear in the final Certificate.\n\nItem #37 is for the new Garage, which has been made 4' longer than originally intended, and includes a passage. This change was specially asked for at both schools, so that the pupils coming in and out of the rear entrance would not have access to the Garage.\n\nI expect to issue the final Certificate on this job just as soon as Mr. P.W.Graham can come to Brocket with his necessary cost data. I am trying to get everything cleaned up by the end of the month.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Construction.\nPROTECT ME FOR TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY EIGHT DOLLARS WAGES DUE ON CHURCH OF ENGLAND SCHOOL PEIGAN RESERVE AT BROCKET ALTA\n\nPERCY H REYNOLDS\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa, 18th July 1927.\n\nMr. Offr,\n\nWould it not be advisable to send a copy of this telegram to W. E. Gardner Smith for him to look into this claim when he issues the final certificate.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6369, file 763-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to advise you that I have issued today the Final Certificate, for $8377.10, to Messrs P.W. Graham & Sons Limited, in full payment for their contract and authorized extra in the erection of the above-mentioned school, and including also the 10% holdback of $5199.00 from previous requisitions, as the job progressed.\n\nI enclose the contractors' complete account of work additional to the contract, stated at $14,925.79. I have gone over every item in this list, and have made reductions and deletions to the best of my ability, having regard to any fair claims made by the contractor but also keeping before me my duty to the Department, and have felt compelled to reduce the contractors' bill by $1246.14. By comparing the two columns \"Charged\" and \"Allowed\", you will readily see wherein I have amended the contractors' charges.\n\nHaving been notified by the Department that my appointment as Inspector of Construction, under the Civil Service Commission, would expire on June 30th, I made every effort to have all work completed, and accounts disposed of by that date. I notified Mr. P.W. Graham to come to Brocket so that we might go over the final accounts together, but he replied that he had got his data all completed, and was at the moment closely tied by a contract his firm were completing in his locality. I then wired him that I could not wait indefinitely, and that I should arrive at Moose Jaw on the 5th instant for the express purpose of having a final settlement made, and requested him to have everything in order. I arrived there on that day, and we spent several hours together going over his final bill. The account as approved by me represents a compromise; Mr. Graham agreeing to think he should receive much more, and I wondering if I was not somewhat exceeding my authority in passing as much as have done. I have used my best judgment, and acted conscientiously, and believe the Department has received fair value for each item I have approved.\n\nI think most items on the list of Additional Work are self-explanatory, but shall make explanations regarding some of them, and shall gladly give any further information on request.\n\nItem 38. The sheet-metal contractor said he had not figured on a service for the extension to the machinery room, and when I insisted that there should be one there, he charged extra for it. Also, a ventilator, with control damper, was placed in sky-light over the power-plant.\n\nItem 39. The contractor states that in his tender for the change in floor lay-out, he only figured a \"stoop\" for the Principal's verandah. He showed me his actual costs of this extension, to which he has added 10%, bringing the cost to $617.00. It is an enclosed verandah similar to what was provided for the Principal at St. Paul's School, Cardston.\n\nItem 40. Extra windows were placed in F's Draw, Rm. & Mach.Rm\n\nItem 43. The Cranbrook Sash & Door Co., who supplied the millwork for this school, scaled the plan slightly less for the windows than I decided was called for. Not being any detail, they...\nItem 43. (cont'd) did not read the 1/8 scale quite the same as I did, and had a number of windows and storm sash framed to a smaller size. On being notified that these were unacceptable, they have charged their factory cost in this connection. As they have treated us generously in other respects, and did some additional work without cost to the Dept', I should like to see this charge passed.\n\n45. The admitting and placing of the heavy \"Chef\" range accounts for the $25.00 shown. A window and frame had to be removed and replaced, and other work done in this connection.\n\n55. In an attempt to keep down the cost of the additional millwork, the Dormitory Lockers were deleted from the list of fixtures asked for, but on authority from Mr.Orr, given to me when in Ottawa, these conveniences were installed. The sum shown is the same as on the original list.\n\nIf any further explanations are desired, I shall be pleased to furnish them, but otherwise I shall try to avoid writing in excessive length on items that are probably readily understood as they stand.\n\nI am spending a little time in Chicago, and can be readily reached at the address shown.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

We have bailed out with a bucket, twice today, about 3 inches of water from the coal cellar and boiler room. The fault lies in the fact that the lowest point in the school draining system is below the basement floor, and not below the boiler room-floor level, which is about 4 ft. below the basement floor level. Could the Dept be approached re supplying some pumping device for such contingencies? Fortunately the plumbing contractor foresaw such a contingency and put in, surplus to specifications, an outlet in the wall of the boiler room which connects with the main drain, about 4ft above the boiler room floor level.\"\n\nI shall be obliged if your department will kindly give the above suggestion prompt consideration and furnish the pump requested.\nIt seems to me, however that a permanently satisfactory remedy for the situation can only be provided by having the drain pipe lowered another 4 ft. from the basement floor level to the floor level of the boiler room and I trust that this action may be taken at the earliest convenience to your department.\n\nBelieve me Sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nField Secretary M.S.O.C.\nSir:-\n\nMay I please be furnished with an accountable cheque for $183.97, representing the balance of the appropriation for the erection of telephone lines to the two schools on the Pelican Reserve, authorized under Department No. 116-1-b dated the 24th February last.\n\nI am asking for the cheque to be forwarded here in order that I may instruct the Agent that the amount of the balance is not to be exceeded and is to be used only for the purpose of paying for labour in the erection.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M.

Reynolds, of Moose Jaw, has filed with the Department a claim against you for that amount in payment of wages due him, and asked to be protected to that amount.

Graham & Sons, Ltd., in their office at Moose Jaw. At that time they lacked a bill from Messrs Snyder & Co., of Calgary, for transmission outlays in the machinery room. We sent a wire to Mr. Snyder, asking for his charges in this connection, but up to the time of my leaving Moose Jaw no reply was received, hence this expenditure was omitted in the final certificate. I told the general contractors that when Mr. Snyder's bill reached me I would certify it, if correct, and that no doubt the Department would pay for it separately.\n\nI now enclose Snyder & Co.'s memo of $75.00 for additional 2 hangers and 2 extra pulleys, and other fittings which were found to be necessary. The other items on the enclosed bill are, I think, self-explanatory, all of which have been supplied, and economically performed.\n\nYou will see from the above heading that I am still in Chicago. I am taking a special \"post-graduate\" course, and am getting a little employment at the same time which will about offset my expenses. I am prepared to return to Alberta, or go elsewhere, on short notice, should the Department have further employment for me.\n\nI would have forwarded the contractors' bill sooner, but expected to be in Ottawa before this, and intended taking the account with me.\n\nIn replying, please address me as above.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Since the spring of this year, when the doors were fitted, all the doors, outside and inside have shrunk about 4 inch. Thus, during exceedingly high winds, which are prevalent here in the winter, a great deal of cold air blows into the building through the doors and windows on the West side of the building. This is especially a cause of much discomfort to the Girls supervisor, whose room adjoins the girls' dormitory, and is the outlet to the fire escape, the door of which opens immediately into her room from the west. This same thing happens through the west door from The Principal's sitting room, and also in the girls Infirmary. Besides being inconvenient, such leakage is the cause of extra expenditure in fuel to keep the building warm. The shrinkage of the doors must be due, I think, to the fact that the lumber was partly green, or to the excessive dryness of the atmosphere here.\n\nWith regard to the storm windows all over the building. These fitted well when first put in in the spring, but now they are all too big. I have asked Mr Indian Agent Arthur to have a carpenter come and fit the windows, and he said he would, as it is a work for a mechanic, especially at the windows of the upper stories. So far this has not been done and we are advancing into the winter and expect bad weather any time.\n\nI might also mention that I have reported to Commissioner Graham, the fact that the fire-escape doors open inwards in the building. Perhaps this could be remedied at the same time.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n(Rev Vivian S.

(RG 10, Volume 6369, file 763-5, part 2)\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to direct your attention to the need of telephone communication between the St. Cyprian School and the village of Brocket, about 3\u00bd miles away. It would appear from information which the Acting Principal received from the local Indian Agent that an appropriation of $600.- was made available for this purpose during the past summer, but no authorization was given at that time, for the school management to proceed with the work of installation. The only action taken in the matter since then is set forth in the following extracts from the Acting Principal's letter just received, and dated Dec. 1st:\n\n\"The scheme which the Indian Agent had, whereby he was going to get the Indians to do the work if the schools fed them, fell through on account of failure, farm work, etc., and we have been marking time since then. The Agent states that the material cost about $400.- and that there is only $200.- left to buy another \u00bd mile of wire, and pay an expert to string it. He asks the school to haul the posts, dig the holes, and put the poles up. My objection to this is (1) This is no weather to dig holes, and frozen soil will not tamp, so that next summer the poles will lean all over the place. (2) We have only four big boys who could help with the work .......\"\n\nIn the light of the above information it seems to me that the school management can not fairly be blamed for the failure to have this telephone communication established before the winter began, and that your Department should undertake all the work required in this connection, with the exception of the haulage of the posts. Whether this work can be undertaken before the spring, will depend on the\nweather conditions which prevail in that part.\n\nI beg to recommend, however, that instructions be forwarded to the Indian Agent to have the work completed as soon as favourable weather conditions obtain, and that the school management be not asked to render any further service beyond what I have mentioned in connection with the hauling of the posts.\n\nBelieve me, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFIELD SECRETARY, M.S.C.C.\nOttawa, December 12, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your No. 406-11A C.E., of July 14th, last, concerning the erection of a telephone line from the St. Cyprian School to Brocket, I should be glad to know how this matter stands at present. The Principal reports that the telephone has not been installed and that the authority which the Indian Agent has includes digging the holes and putting up the poles by the school management. It appears that the school is willing to haul the posts, but that they have no big boys for the other purpose. Please let me have a report and recommendation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 12th instant #116-1-5, concerning the erection of a telephone line from the St. Cyprian School to Brocket, and asking me for a report as to how the matter stands.\n\nI regret to say that there has been a great deal of delay in the matter of getting the telephone lines to both the schools on the Peigan reserve erected, and Mr. Arthur must accept most of the responsibility for this, as he was instructed to purchase the necessary material and arrange for the erection of the lines with the assistance of the bigger boys at the schools. He did purchase the material and a voucher amounting to $416.03 covering same was received here on April 8th. On July 8th, Mr. Arthur wrote to this office asking to be furnished with an accountable cheque for the balance of the $600.00 authorized for this work, which was $183.97, and this was obtained from Ottawa and forwarded to him on July 28th. On August 24th, he was written to from this office, and asked to submit a voucher accounting for this money. To this he never replied and on November 2nd, he was again written to and to this he replied on the 16th. idem as follows,-\n\n\"I beg to say the advance for telephone line is still intact. The two principals of the schools were ready to commence operations building the lines when this storm arrived and at present it is almost impossible for them to do anything until the weather moderates.\"\n\nFrom this you will see that he did not get this work started at all during the long summer and well on into the Fall and did not reply to letters that were sent to him. This is not the first time that Mr. Arthur has bungled matters, and as I have often said before-\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, January 3, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 406-11A. of the 20th ultimo, with reference to telephone connection for the two Indian Residential Schools on the Peigan Reserve.

Indian Residential School Peigan Reserve. The only firm in Calgary handling this commodity. This expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. dated\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 1\nDear Mr. Graham,\n\nI have the honour to report that during my recent trip to Alberta and while at the Peigan agency I called at the two residential schools on the reserve.\n\nAt the R.C. School everything was in first-class order, the children all looked well and things in general seemed to be progressing very favourably. The only trouble there was in connection with the water supply, the well having practically gone dry. There has been an abundance of water in this well and at the time it was drilled it was thought that there would be an unlimited supply. The impression was that sand or quicksand had cut off the supply and they were cleaning it out when I was there. As there is nothing on the file here concerning the matter it is probable that the water has come back into the well.\n\nAt the Anglican School everything seemed to be in fair shape also. The school was clean and tidy and matters in general seemed to be running along smoothly. When I was at Nobbema I received a wire from you instructing me to purchase five cows for the school, which I did. I may say that at the present time it is a very difficult matter to buy milk cows.\n\nW. W. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6369, file 763-5, part 2)\nInspector Christianson's report on Peigan Schools.\n\nI was in touch with most of the stockmen in Alberta and the only place I could find any cows was at the C.P.R. Farm at Strathmore. The cows which I bought are Holstein. They are not pedigreed; two of them are pure bred but have no papers and the other three are practically pure bred. All have passed the tuberculin test and two of them had just freshened, while the other three are due to freshen around the end of this month. The price paid for these cows was $125.00 each, which I consider very reasonable. They are from three to six years of age and if properly looked after will produce a lot of milk.\n\nRegarding the telephone lines to the schools, the material was purchased last April with the understanding that whatever money was left over out of the amount of $600.00 could be used by the schools to assist in erecting the lines and that whatever labour could not be paid for the schools would perform with their own staff and the bigger boys. I outlined this both to the Principals and the Agent when I was there a year ago and instructions in writing to this effect were also sent by yourself. From that time on this matter was evidently dormant until it froze up last Fall, when several letters passed between yourself and the Agent. When I arrived there in January I found that the R.C. School had erected the poles for their part of the line, but were waiting for the Anglican School to start putting their end of the line in which commences at the agency, and I found that they had made no preparation whatever. I looked thoroughly into this matter, interviewed both Principals and threshed it out with Mr. Arthur, and the following is just what happened. From the time the material was purchased in April until some time in October no real effort was made by Mr. Arthur to have this work performed. He probably mentioned it once or twice to -the Principals-\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6369, file 763-5, part 2)\nInspector Christianson's report on Peigan Schools.\n\nthe Principals, and some time in June he evidently thought of having the Indians make a bee and erect all the poles. This, however, he failed to do and nothing further was done in the matter until some time late in October. Father Levern immediately started in and he told me himself that he and the boys put up the poles in something like four days, so you can see it is no great task. The Principal of the Anglican School, however, did not go on with his part of the work. He evidently advised his Farming Instructor to start the work but the Farming Instructor refused. The matter was then taken up with the Commission and Dr. Westgate and the action of the Farming Instructor was upheld, so that as far as Mr. Lord was concerned his hands were tied. While I was there I got the work under way and the only extra cost will be for the purchase of a little wire if we happen to run short. I do not know how the work is progressing but I hope it will be finished before the end of the fiscal year.

From time to time bad drain smells seem to come up through sink or toilet traps, mostly in the basement, and percolate up through the building. There is no stoppage in the drains, but it seems to me as if bubbles form in the drain pipe and force themselves up through the traps. These smells are unhealthy and nauseating, and should be dealt with at once.\n\n2. There is no valve to let the water out of the main water pressure tanks for cleaning purposes. The water pumped from the well at times contains much sediment and this is accumulating in the tanks. The tanks are placed horizontally one above the other, and when the water is low, the top tank being empty, the sediment flushed from the upper to the lower tank, makes the water very muddy which is forced through the pipes. A valve could be placed in the engine room for draining the tanks fairly easily. It also seems to me that a mistake was made in embedding some of the piping in concrete, making future repairs hard.\n\n3. The return gasoline pipe from the engine to the underground gasoline tank is also embedded in the concrete of the engine room floor. Some time ago the coupling at the end of this pipe at the carburetor broke, and I had to make a temporary joint. There is no way of taking the pipe away so as to weld or solder it and it would be too dangerous to weld it as it is connected with the gas tank, with its inflammable fumes. This ought to be remedied.\n\n4. When the school was being built I asked for the basement windows, especially those of the boys and girls play-rooms to be fitted with wire mesh screens, the same as at the Elk Horn school. These were not fitted, and their necessity has been proved to my satisfaction since. Would the Dept. fit these now, on all the basement windows.\n\nI feel that the health of all the inmates of the school depend on the drain smells being remedied, and if it is bad now in the winter, it will be much worse in the summer.\n\n(Sgd) Vivian S. Lord,\nPrincipal\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6369, file 763-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nSir:-\n\nReplying to your letter No. 406-11A C.E. of the 31st ultimo I would say that in company with Mr. Stanley Pearson I have made a careful survey of the sewage system at the C.E. School here and we can find no fault with the workmanship of installation nor can we determine any cause for the alleged non-working of the plant.\n\nThere is a possibility of gas returning in small quantities should there be a temporary stoppage in the sewer pipe and a toilet in the upper part were tripped. This might give a small amount of gas at some of the outlets lower down in the building but a small amount of water run into the sink or other opening to the sewer would immediately remedy this.\n\nRegarding the second complaint I find that at times there is quite a lot of sediment in the water of this well and as there was no provision made in the installation for cleaning the tanks the sediment has accumulated till now the water is always cloudy. A valve would be useless for this purpose but a hand hole in the end of the lower tank near the bottom would serve the purpose and I would recommend that this be done.\n\nRegarding the gasoline pipe from the engine to the tank has been broken by what appears to be pure carelessness and I cannot see how the matter could be improved by exposing more of the pipe line. The plumber states that he can make a joint at a small cost with perfect safety and I have tried to impress on the staff the necessity of using ordinary care with this equipment.\n\nAs regards the breakage of the lower windows an enquiry elicits the information that during the last year only twelve lights were broken which amount does not seem to call for the expenditure of the amount necessary to protect these windows with coarse wire screen.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd) G.A. Arthur,\nIndian Agent.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6369, file 763-5, part 2)\nSir:\n\nOn the 19th of March I received a letter from the Rev. T.B.H. Westgate, enclosing copy of one received by him from the Reverend Principal of the St. Cyprian Indian School on the Peigan Reserve, a copy of which I attach hereto.\n\nI wrote to the Indian Agent requesting him to look into the various matters complained of and furnish me with a full report on the subject. This, I received yesterday and attach a copy hereto. You will note that Mr. C.A. Arthur made a survey of the school in company with an experienced plumber, Mr. Stanley Pearson, and that the complaints lodged by the Principal appear to be exaggerated. However, some expenditure will be incurred in remedying certain conditions, an estimate of which the Agent did not supply me with. I should like to have the Department's authority to put into effect the suggestions made by Mr. Pearson, which will be attended to as economically as possible. As Mr. Pearson made the survey with the Agent, it would probably be as well to engage him to do the necessary work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M.

In the carrying out of any work in placing the sewage and water system in a good state of repair, the cost should be kept as low as possible.\n\nIt is noted from the Agent's report that the breaking of the gasoline pipe from the engine to the tank was caused through carelessness on the part of the school authorities.\n\nThe Department is not prepared at the present time to install wire screens on the basement windows.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Mr Scott:\n\nRev. Fr J.L. Levern O.M.I., Principal of Peigan Indian Residential School has brought to my attention a fact which is a cause of worry for him.\n\nThe case is that of the construction of a stable in connection with the new building. Work on this stable was started on the 17th inst and to quote the Principal's words: \"this stable had to be built only where Commissioner Graham wished to have it. That means that an extra $100.00 had to be paid to afford us the great disadvantage of having the north end two feet above the ground and the south end one foot in the ground in such a way that there will always be a large hole of mud, snow or ice at the door of the stable. We have protested and protested again, but to no avail and finally Inspector Smith had to yield.\"\n\nI do not understand the reason of Mr Graham's attitude in this and similar cases. I may add that the principals of our schools do not understand how the Commissioner can exercise such unlimited power over their schools and over the Indians at large. He seems to be the whole Department of Indian Affairs by himself. Really at times one would think that he considers himself as holding the monopoly of intelligence and judgment. Yet he should think that as a rule principals on Indian Schools are in a better position than himself to choose most suitable sites for outbuildings and most practical types of constructions and also that they as much at heart as himself the development and success of their respective institution.\n\nFor example, at Blood R.C. School and at Thunderchild's barns were built in spite of the repeated protests of\nthe principals. The result was in the case of Blood School that even in Mr Graham's estimation the barn is hardly fit to be used even as a granary and that the Commissioner had to promise another more substantial barn. At Thunderchild the barn was too small and unfinished. I could bring to your knowledge other facts all illustrating that our poor and devoted men in the field are simply the victims of a nearly tyrannical authority.\n\nReally the situation is becoming every day more unbearable and I must admit to you that I am presently studying the most appropriate means to obtain a favorable change. May I be allowed to state that in my estimation such a change would be welcomed by the members of the other denominations interested in indian educational work and even by a large number of officers of the Indian Department.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Sep't 4, 1926.\n\nW.M.Graham Esq.\nIndian Commissioner.\nREGINA, Sask.\n\nRe- R.C.School; Pelican Reserve.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAt the request of the Reverend Principal (Father Levern) and the Procurator of the Oblate Fathers (Rev.Father Naessens) I am bringing to your attention their wish for a Garage as part of the school building now being erected.\n\nThe Reverend Fathers state that they had intended making this request known earlier, but it was overlooked, or rather they thought they had done so, but I replied that I had not received any definite request to write about it, although I recall hearing them discussing the subject. I promised I would refer their request to you.\n\nI enclose a floor plan of the rear part of the basement. You will notice there is an offset, or unbuilt corner, between the laundry and a staff room presumably intended for the engineer, and it is the wish that this space be made use of for a Garage.\n\nThe Contractor quotes a price of $839.00 for extending the structure to include this corner as a Garage, with roof and walls to match adjoining work, with concrete floor, window, small and double doors, painted, and with steam heat and light extended to same.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n(Sgd) E.Gardner-Smith.\nInspector of Construction.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS.\n\nCANADA.\n\nCommissioner's Office.\nRegina, Sask. Sep't 14th, 1926.\n\nRe- Garage at R.C.School.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge your letter of the 4th instant, and note that you are again writing letters on behalf of the Reverend Principal with regard to changes. If the Reverend Principal has anything to suggest to the Department it must come direct to this office. I strongly object to your conferring with the Principal on matters of this kind. As far as having a garage in the basement is concerned, this is the last thing I will recommend. In the first place it would be expensive, and in the second place this is the wrong location for a garage.\n\nIn due course the Department may be prepared to spend about $150.00 to erect a garage. This I would point out to you would be a saving of about $700.00.\n\nOnce more I would ask you to exercise economy.\n\nYours truly\n\n(Sgd) W.M.Graham.\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nE.Gardner-Smith Esq.\nInspector of Construction.\nBrocket, Alta.\nC/O Indian Office.\nBrocket, Alta. Dec. 1st, 1926.\n\nDuncan C. Scott Esq.\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe- R.C. School; Peigan Reserve.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nYour letter dated the 10th ultimo did not reach Brocket until the 25th, and in this connection I might add that the Ottawa postal stamp on the envelope is dated Nov. 24th.\n\nWith regard to the request of the Reverend Principal for a Garage, I enclose copies of correspondence which passed between me and the Indian Commissioner on this subject.\n\nIn the quotation originally given by Mr. Scallan he figured in matching the existing construction of the adjoining building. After receiving your letter I went into the matter with him again, and by making reducing the concrete wall from 13\" to 8\", and by making other structural changes, he is now able to quote a price of $620.00 instead of $879.00 previously quoted\u2014a difference of $259.00. Even with the changes indicated we can have a very satisfactory Garage.\n\nThe entrance to the Garage would be from grade level, and not down into a basement as the Commissioner seemed to imagine. The location is suitable in every way, and without question such a Garage as is suggested would prove a great boon to the local people, particularly in wintry weather.\n\nI might mention that the Principal of the Church of England school asked some time ago if it would be possible for them to have a heated Garage similarly attached to the building, but I informed the Principal of the Commissioner's reply to the R.C. request, and the matter was temporarily dropped.\n\nWith reference to the location of the new barn at the R.C. School, I do not think it was placed to the best advantage owing to there being a drop of 3' #7\" in the ground in the 70' length of the barn. This will mean considerable additional cost in concrete, inside filling to build up the floor level, and in outside grading. I wired Regina suggesting that the position of the barn be changed to avoid these drawbacks, but it was refused. Apart from the additional cost, I do not think there is any serious ultimate detriment from the barn being placed where it is.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6369, file 763-5, part 2)\nFebruary 15th, 1927.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nHon. Charles Stewart -\n\nThe principals of the two new Indian Residential schools now under construction on the Peigan reserve have asked that a garage be provided at each institution. They recommend that an addition be erected adjoining the rear portion of the main building adjacent to the machinery room, in order that the garages might be heated during the winter, the cars being in use during the entire season. The cost in this event would be $600.00 each.\n\nOn the other hand Mr. Graham recommends that separate buildings, unheated, be erected. These could be constructed for approximately $280.00 each.\n\nIn view of the fact that the cars are in use during the winter, I am of opinion that the convenience of having the garages heated in the winter would warrant the additional expenditure. As the work on the main buildings is almost completed immediate decision is desirable.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. Scott,\n\nWith reference to my memorandum of the 23rd December last regarding the articles required for the new Peigan Indian residential school, will you kindly see that the firm of H.

S. G. I. A.\nSacred Heart Indian Residential School, Brocket, Alta., Dec.15th, 1927\n\nThe Honourable Duncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIt is with the greatest pleasure that I come again to offer you my most sincere wishes for a merry Christmas and a happy new year, and to thank you again for your great kindness towards me.\n\nIt is with good reason indeed that, on the 29th of last August, you told us here \"not to measure by the shortness of your visit the interest you take in our work\". That same day, you kindly invited me also to write you and let you know about our little crop: it is the remembrance of these new tokens of sympathy joined to the numerous ones of the past that has prompted me to add a few lines to this letter, which I started with the only intention of fulfilling a duty of gratitude.\n\nYou will be surprised to hear that this crop, which looked so promising, has turned out a failure: the frost came before it was ripe; we did cut and thresh it and got 1765 bushels of wheat & 535 bus. of oats. I'm holding all the oats for the spring work and have sold the wheat, which was graded \"feed wheat\", and the returns are not even sufficient to pay my expenses: for instance, my threshing bill, which I just received from the Peigan Agency, amounts to $614.90, that is over 26\u00a2 a bushel, for the oats as well as for the wheat!\n\nI frankly admit that I feel somewhat disappointed, and the more so because I absolutely need two more teams of good horses and two sets of harness to put in the next crop -160 acres-, and have no way now\nto make that purchase, which would cost about $550.00, viz. $400.00 for the horses and $150.00 for the harnesses.\n\nSuch is the reason why I have thought of showing you my situation by giving you these details, in the hope that you may see your way in granting me that amount,\n\nThanking you once more from my heart for all you have done for me, I remain, dear Sir,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ.

(RG 10, Volume 6370, file 763-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nStrictly Confidential\n\nNov 26th 28\n\nDear Mr Scott,\n\nPlease forgive me for not writing sooner before you asked me to inform you about regard to what news going on here.\n\nIn Lord Principal of the school here, a returned Veteran of the Canadian Corp, has just read a letter from the M.S.C telling him that his services will not be required after the end of January, upon statement made by you of the society, from information you have gathered when you visited this reserve last year, or what you have read from other sources.\n\nIn the first place may I say, whom some you the information, did not stick to facts, and I am afraid altogether to the truth.\n\nThe work at the school to my mind has been most satisfactory considering the difficulties it has had to contend with. This year they have grown and threshed 12 acres of wheat, 177 bushels, barley 19 acres 350 bushels, oats 45 acres 770 bushels, and put up all the hay and feed required for the stock, besides growing all the vegetables they need require.\n\nThey had 17 tons of potatoes, store & fencing inside rather small and, such a thing has not been done before in the history of the Mission, then considering the school land is mostly old farms, and nothing but a mass of stumps.\n\nI think they have done remarkably well.\n\nYour orders to the Indian Agent to please farmers have not been carried out.\n\nI have been on most of the Reserves in Alberta, but nowhere have I seen such careful, hearty farmers as here.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6370, file 763-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nI again repeat the school has done some considerable, but difficulties little which we have had to contend.\n\nThey have a very competent staff all working in harmony, and very good progress has been made, which will compare very favorably with any other school in the district.\n\nThe Indians all like Mr. Lord and trust him.\n\nYet some statement has been made to you upon which you have based your actions to ask for his removal (omitted).\n\nI am afraid those statements are not founded on fact.\n\nI will abstain from further comment, which I could make upon the state of affairs here, because I feel you will not be disposed to meet me, you having received information on one side only. I cannot help but feel that Mr. Lord is not getting a fair show, there are others who should be brought to terms, and while they are, you cannot expect any progress.\n\nI maintain you do not know all the facts, and as what you know is one side only, you have taken your stand for his removal.\n\nConstant claims for are not good either for the children or Indians.\n\nI am not asking any favors for Mr. Lord, only that he be given a fair play.\n\nI wish to add reasons for your action, and why you gave you the information so that he may have also satisfaction & peace or misfortune.\n\nThanking you for all your kind kindness,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nW.R.

I will keep in mind your request, however, and at the first opportunity will have him make an inspection of the Peigan School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

(RG 10, Volume 6370, file 763-5, part 3)\nMissionary Society of the Church of England in Canada\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nDuring my recent visit (on January 29th) to the St. Cyprian School, I gave careful attention to the shrinkage in the wood work, especially in connection with the doors and windows, and satisfied myself that some immediate remedial action was required to add to the comfort of the staff and pupils, and to reduce our Society's heavy bill for fuel at this institution. The shrinkage to which I refer was too great to be remedied by the School management, and after reporting the situation to our Commission they instructed me to ask if your Department would kindly look into this important matter. I suggested to our Commission that as Mr. Gardner Smith, who was Inspector of Construction when this building was being erected, and was now discharging a similar duty at the new Blood hospital, his services might be available in this connection at but small expense to your Department, and the members authorized me to submit this suggestion to you for your consideration.\n\nWhile writing, our Commission instructed me to direct your attention also to the need of another staff room. At the present time, the engineer and his wife are both filling staff appointments, the latter holding the position of Kitchen Matron. As she has been in our Society's service for many years but is now finding the work beyond her strength, our Commission have decided to appoint a younger person to this position. The lack of staff-room accommodation, however, presents a formidable difficulty, unless the \"guest-room\" be taken for this purpose, and our Commission feel that this should not be done if it can be avoided. They are of the opinion that as the School has been provided with a second class-room 15' x 30' on the first floor, the whole of which is not likely to be required at any time for class-room purposes, that a suitable staff-room could be partitioned off at one end of the same, and I was instructed to lay this suggestion before you. Beyond the installation of the partition...\nAnd the provision of a doorway from the main corridor to the room, very little more would be required, and comparatively little expenditure involved.\n\nOur Commission were of the opinion that your representative could report to you on this matter at the same time, as on the matter referred to above.\n\nFurther urgent requirements which I noted at this School were a shed for soft coal, and storage space for storm windows and mosquito screens. I found the screens stored in the granary, as there was no available space for them in the main School building, and our Commission instructed me to direct your attention to these two requirements also. In the opinion of our Commission the shed for the soft coal and the storage space for the storm sash and screens, could be combined in the one building.\n\nI commend the above requirements to your earliest and most favourable consideration, and remain, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nTER#JF\n\nIndian Affairs.

Lancaster,\nActing Indian Agent,\nBrocket, Alta.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nThe approximate cost of the changes on the heating system at the R.C. School, recommended by Mr. N Marshall, boiler inspector, will be in the neighborhood of Two hundred and seventy Dollars.\n\nTo install a larger radiator in the farm-hands rooms, and install one air compressor for use with the domestic water system. Two hundred and thirty five dollars. The last two items were taken up with Mr. Christensen, by the Rev. Father Lavern.\n\nThis would bring the total to Five Hundred and Five dollars.\n\nIt is quite a costly job to install these valves and hand-holes etc., now, and a very difficult one. This work on the boilers should have been done at the time the building was in progress. However, I will do all I can to keep the price down, at the same time having due regard to efficiency.\n\nSincerely Yours,\n\n(Sgd) S. Pearson.\nSir,\n\nIn reference your letter No. II6-15 of March 26th with authority to make changes in the two schools as per Boiler Inspector's report, I took Mr Pearson to the two schools to look over the proposed work and give me an estimate of the approximate cost of the work required.\n\nIn installing the various boilers and such new the contractors did not install valves and unions etc which they should have done in order to make replacements easy and of small cost and any repairs or replacements put in now will be costly, as the whole system will have to be drained out by hand and disconnected in order to put in valves etc and the labour entailed will be as costly as the new material.\n\nIn regard to the heater mentioned by Mr Pearson for the C of E School it will be necessary to have a new one for the R.C. School as well, as the quality of the water at both schools fills the jacket and pipes of the heater with a cement like substance which makes it impossible for the water to circulate through.\n\nI have not had any work started on this authority owing to the extent of the probable cost and have been waiting for Mr Pearson to make his report with approximate cost and am herewith enclosing letters from Mr Pearson in regard to the proposed changes.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.C.

(RG 10, Volume 6370, file 763-5, part 3)\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, On.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith further reference to my letter of Feb. 19th last, and your reply to the same on March 4th, #116-1-5, relative to (1) the urgent need of having the St. Cyprian School made weatherproof, and (2) the installation of a partition in the class-room on the first floor of this School so as to provide an additional staff room, I shall be glad to know what action is being taken by your Department in connection with these matters. From the standpoint of administration they are both extremely important to our Commission, and I trust that they may receive your prompt and sympathetic consideration. The necessity of the additional staff room was clearly set forth in my letter of Feb. 19th, and need not be repeated here.\n\nWith regard to the necessity of having the building made weatherproof, I beg to state that during the March Quarter our Commission met bills for coal alone amounting to $617.72. Since that time a further expenditure for coal has amounted to $615.00 making a total expenditure on this one item for the first six months of this year $1,032.72. When this expenditure is placed side by side with our receipts under per capita earnings for the March Quarter, and which amounted to $1,278.75 - on an average attendance of 31, you will be able to understand the difficulty and anxiety which confront our Commission in the administration of this School. As there can be no doubt that the heavy expenditure for coal is partly due to the shrinkage in the woodwork of the School, and referred to in my letter quoted above, you will understand, I think, and appreciate, the reasonableness of our request that the main school building be made as nearly weatherproof as possible.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6370, file 763-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nI shall be deeply obliged, therefore, if your Department will kindly give this matter and that of the additional staff room space as early attention as possible. If you can find, at the same time, any means of increasing the pupilage at this School to capacity, such increase will be a great help to our Society and will be very greatly appreciated.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nPincher Creek, Alta.

At the present time, this coal is stored in one end of the implement shed which is some distance from the main school building. This is very inconvenient in many ways, and I trust that your Department may be able to provide storage space for this coal in closer proximity to the main school building. An underground bin on the kitchen side of the basement might be made, with a hole in the top for dumping the coal in direct from the wagon or sleigh. This would necessitate the conversion of one of the windows on that side of the kitchen into a doorway.\n\nI commend this need to your sympathetic consideration and trust that it may be made at an early date.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.B.R.

In the list of our general requirements submitted to you last autumn, for inclusion in your Estimates for the fiscal year 1930-31, this item was mentioned, and it was suggested that the coal shed might be combined with a store house and work shop, the total cost being estimated at $700.00.

I would not recommend this action. The change might be made and at a later date found inconvenient because the purpose for which it was effected might no longer exist.

W. Barlow, called here and requested that the Department install electric bells, the wiring outlets for these are already installed, I believe.\n\nIn reference to the Fire-escapes, the lower sections of these are on the premises I believe, but at time of building the school they were never installed, and this causes a jump of from 9 to 11 feet by the pupils when coming down the escape, and the principal urges that they be completed.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.

Dr. Westgate, are to prevent access to the school dormitories when the exits to the fire escapes are kept locked from the outside, it is considered there is no reason why a suitable door lock could not be supplied - one where the outside knob refuses to turn the lock and the inside one opens freely. There are comparatively inexpensive sets of this kind on the market - for example, a lock of the Yale type. It is thought that this would be less expensive and just as suitable as an electric alarm bell, and you may arrange for the purchase of locks of the type mentioned for the doors leading to the fire escapes.\n\nRegarding the extension of the fire escapes, I have to say that you may arrange to have a few feet added to each in order to overcome the necessity of the pupils having to pump the distance from the end of the present escapes. No unnecessary expenditure should be incurred for the purpose or in the purchase of the locks for the doors leading to the fire escapes. After this work has been carried out, you should forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH. G.

Mr. Barlow called at the office and brought to my attention that the palliasses that were supplied to his school some years ago to be used as mattresses, were completely worn out. I informed him at the time that I would be down at the Peigan Agency and intended visiting the school and would look into the matter then. I learned that the school had been supplied with two or three sets of palliasses when it was first opened. They were filled with straw and hay and answered the purpose of a mattresses but this is not very satisfactory. At any rate, they are completely worn out and they have now only those left on the beds, the others having been used for patching. Those on the bed are in such shape that they are past repairing and either mattresses or more palliasses will have to be supplied.\n\nI pointed out to Mr. Barlow that the Department probably would not have funds for this at the present time. If this is the case the school can get along with what they have until next spring. After the beginning of the next fiscal year, if the Department could see its way clear to furnish mattresses, I would recommend that this be done. The number of children at the school is 33 but I believe there are more to come in about Christmas time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.

I would suggest, however, that you forward another request next spring for the quantity of mattresses required. You should give sizes, that is, length and width of the mattresses and, if possible, state the approximate cost.

April 10th, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to bring to your attention Department's letter No. 116-1-5 of December 5th last, in connection with the purchase of mattresses for the St. Cyprian Indian Residential School in the Peigan Agency. I was instructed to bring this matter to the attention of the Department after the end of the fiscal year.\n\nIn this connection I wish to state that the number of mattresses the Principal has asked for is 40. When I inspected the school last November 33 children were present, but I understood there were more children to come. The size of mattresses required is 6' X 216\". As to the price of the mattresses: These can be purchased as low as $4.00 or $4.50, but at this price they would not be very durable. In conversation with the Manager of Simmons Bedding Company here, he advised me that a good mattress that would last for years is worth from $8.00 to $10.00. If the funds of the Department are limited the cheaper mattress would, of course, answer the purpose for a short time, but buying a cheaper article is expensive in the long run. I am, however, leaving this matter to the discretion of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mr. Barlow, Principal of St. Syrian School at Brocket was in a few days ago and he informed me that they very nearly had a fire at the school a week or so ago, the cook having put too much coal in the cook-stove and left the dampers open. The pipes got red hot but fortunately no fire got started in the partitions through which the pipes run. He informed me that there are 6 different partitions at the school that pipes run through. For instance, the stove pipes run from the cook stove through one partition and then into the chimney.\n\nThe partitions are lath and plaster with an ordinary thimble and the stove pipes run through this thimble. Mr. Barlow is of the opinion that it would be safer if the holes in the partitions were made larger and brick put in with cement, and then the thimble through the bricks. He informs me that he can get this work done for $15.00 and of course it would only take a few bricks. It appears to me that this might afford greater protection from fire hazard. Mr. Orr, our Architect might have something better to suggest in the matter.\n\nI might say that Mr. Barlow discharged the cook as this had happened before and she had been warned on several occasions to be very careful not to allow the stove-pipes to get too hot.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nM.

The batteries at the Sacred Heart School were supplied by the Brotherston Electric Company, Limited, Calgary, and the ones at the St. Cyprian School, by George H. Scougall, Macleod, Alberta.\n\nThe cost of the batteries for each school will be, approximately, $500.00.

The batteries at present in use at each of these schools have been in operation since November, 1931. The cost of supplying new batteries will be, approximately, $500.00 for each school.\n\nIt has occurred to me that it might be possible to have these schools connected up with the lines of the Calgary Power Company and thus obtain light and power, obviating the necessity of renewing batteries for the lighting plants from time to time.\n\nI would request that you report as to the advisability of supplying these schools with light and power and installing the necessary power line from the Calgary Power Company plant to the schools. You should state the distance it would be necessary to extend the power line to each school and the approximate cost.

On digging down six feet to the top of the tank, the plank top was found to be rotten, making it extremely dangerous for anyone to go down into the tank to make necessary repairs or investigate conditions. It was also found that an essential \"T\" Pipe in the tank had broken off and it will be necessary to replace it with a new one, also there will have to be a new top and I am enclosing Mr Pearson's Letter, stating what he would do the work for, and I would strongly recommend that a concrete top be installed, the difference in price would be only $35.00, but the job would be permanent and satisfactory.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nsir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.C. Lancaster,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nAn early reply will oblige.\n\nH.C.\nOttawa, April 11, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, regarding the condition of the septic tank at the St. Cyprian Indian Residential School and enclosing an estimate of the cost of the work required in installing a cover.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department will approve of an expenditure for the purpose of installing a concrete cover on the tank and replacing the necessary pipe and fittings. It is noted that the cost of the above will be $127.50. You may therefore arrange to have this work carried out. Please see that a satisfactory job is completed. When the work has been performed to your satisfaction, you should forward accounts, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred, which should not exceed the above mentioned amount.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

W.Barlow,\nPrincipal,\nSt.Cyprian Indian Res. School,\nBrocket, Alta.\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nDuring my visit to our Peigan School last September, I was strongly impressed by the need of a \"pavilion,\" or shelter of some kind, especially for the girl pupils, on their playground. The Principal is endeavoring to get trees and hedges to grow around the main school building, but it will be sometime before his desire in this matter can be achieved, and even then, the shelter thus provided will scarcely meet the need I have mentioned.\n\nIt is the wish of the School management that the pupils should spend as much time as possible in the open air, but at present the open air periods are greatly curtailed by the strong winds which prevail in that part of the country, and I am convinced that a \"pavilion\" would be a very great help in extending these.\n\nI have fully explained the situation to our Commission, and the members agreed to meet the cost of a comparatively small but substantial structure, if your Department would kindly prepare plans and specifications. It seems to me that a floor space of about 15' by 21', raised about 18\" above the ground level, with walls boarded up to a height of say 4', and then open from there to the eave of the gable or cottage roof, would be sufficient, and if your architect will kindly prepare a plan and specifications I shall be deeply obliged.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mr. Barlow said he would requisition for material through the Agency office, and that they would do the work themselves.\n\nFire Escapes:\n\nThese are steel staircases -- one at each end of the building. I noticed there were no lights (electric) over same. Therefore in a rush on a dark night there is danger of missing the steps and falling, which would cause a congestion and danger of injury. The last lower flight on the West end -- girls' section -- lands on the roof of a porch (brick walls with flat roof). From the top of this the pupils have to jump to the ground, some seven feet, which is rather high for young children. There should be another stairway erected here: This could be raised by pulleys and weights to prevent ascending from the ground, and could be lowered when needed to descend. The East end -- boys' section -- has this extra flight.\n\nShould a fire break out in the hallway of the main floor, or this become filled with smoke while the pupils are in the classrooms, the exit would have to be made through a window onto a porch (brick walls, flat roof) at the East end of the building; then jump to the ground. It would be better and safer if this ordinary two-piece lifting sash in the window were changed for a casement window. The cost of these alterations, the extra steel stairs at the girls' end, and electric lights over the fire escapes, would not be very high. I suggested to Mr. Barlow, who seems to be much concerned about it, that he place the matter before the Department through the Agent's office. I told him I would report on it as well.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The interior was all painted last year & they have a surplus of paint on hand, may this also be cancelled. The Linoleum asked I consider is a secondary consideration to protecting the outside of the School Building with paint from the elements.\n\nI would therefore strongly urge that the above requests be allowed to stand over until next year, and the requisition herewith being submitted be given consideration, as the building is in very bad condition, devoid of paint in places, and the roof needs repairing as it is leaking.\n\nIt will be noted I have mentioned Mr V.D'Acoust of Pincher Creek for the labour, he painted Agency Buildings in 1936, and the work was entirely satisfactory.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.W.

There is a limited amount available in our appropriation for repairs and improvements at this school, and the above paint and linoleum was intended for interior use. The acting Indian agent now advises me that he considers it would be better policy to expend the amount available this year in painting the exterior of the building and repairing the roof.\n\nUnder these circumstances, I should appreciate it if you would cancel our purchase requisition of July 5, 1938.\n\nT.

D'Aoust, of Pincher Creek, who has quoted a price of $275.00. The agent considers that this is reasonable and he further advises that Mr. D'Aoust will do satisfactory work as he painted the agency buildings in 1936.\n\nI should appreciate receiving the approval of the Honourable the Minister for painting the exterior of the St. Cyprian C. E. Residential School and, in that event, the purchase requisition should be forwarded to the Purchasing Agent.\n\nPlease advise me if you approve of our engaging Mr. D'Aoust to do the work.\n\nT. R.

In order to repair this it will be necessary to have the plumber & his assistant come out from Pincher Creek, erect a tripod & necessary equipment to hoist it up. On enquiries I have made, the plumber informs me that it may be possible to pull up the rods with valves attached, instead of having to pull the whole string of pipes up. In the event of only the rods being pulled up, it will cost around $30.00 to $40.00 to repair it.

This appears to me to be in a very unsafe condition owing to the extremely high winds in this district; therefore if it should fall at any time it would endanger the lives of anybody in the building or within range outside the building. I would certainly recommend that an expert be authorised to examine this smokestack as soon as possible. The principal (Rev. W. Barlow) asked me to inspect it when I was there, hence my report.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. W.

This would take approximately sixteen feet of new fire escape, and it should be built to the same specifications as the one now there. The new section should be stationary, and to prevent anyone entering, the opening from the outside there should be installed on each door opening into the fire escape, a panic door latch. The doors then would never be locked by any one inside the building, but would prevent anyone entering from the outside.\n\nI am assured you that the suggestions I have made are the least costly, and at the same time the most practical. I can undertake to do this work as stated and provide all materials for the completion of same.\n\nFor the consideration of $154.00\n\nHoping to hear from you at your convenience,\n\nYours Sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6370, file 763-5, part 5)\nSir,\n\nRe Fire escape at St. Cyprian's Indian Res. School.\n\nThis week I was out to the St. Cyprian's School, and inspected the Fire Extinguishers, also the Fire Escape on the Girls side of the building. On this side the fire-escape does not reach the ground but is within 10 feet of the ground; it ends on the top of a porch. From here the children would have to jump to the ground. This is not safe, and I have priced an extension from Mr. S. Pearson, of Pincher Creek; also the doors leading out to Fire-escape should be fitted with special bars that would cause the doors to open immediately from inside of the building, but would prevent access from outside; this is necessary owing to young Indian men trying to enter at nights.\n\nI trust the Department will authorise the expenditure for this as soon as possible; I think the quotation should be accepted as it compares favourably with the Lethbridge Iron Works price which I got last year.

Webb, Indian Agent, dated December 3 with reference to the smoke stack at the St. Cyprian Indian residential school. The Agent states that he has forwarded a copy of this letter to you.\n\nIs this smoke stack in as dangerous a condition as the Agent considers? We are approaching the end of the fiscal year and so many unexpected expenditures have occurred during the past three months that our funds are such as will not permit our incurring any expenditure that can possibly be avoided. If this chimney was properly erected when the school was built there is no reason why it should require extensive repairs at the present time. However, if you feel it advisable you might have some competent person examine the smoke stack and following this examination you should report to the Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Sellens, District Resident Architect, Dept. of Public Works, (Dominion), Calgary, to check same over with us. This was done on the 17th instant by his assistant, Mr. D. A. Freeze, whom I met at the school while at the Agency on an inspection visit. I beg to enclose herewith copy of the report received from Mr. Freeze in this connection.\n\nI am also forwarding a copy of this report to Agent Webb, asking him to show same to the Rev. Principal of the School, in order that the repairing of the flashing at the roof surface, and the raking out and re-pointing with mortar of the joints between the roof and ceiling may be clearly understood. This was explained to the principal by Mr. Freeze at time of his visit.\n\nThe removing or loose bricks on top of the small chimney and installing a cement cap in their place was also mentioned by Mr. Freeze. The loose bricks were removed immediately, but the cement cap had not been made prior to my leaving the Agency.--the weather was quite cold at the time.-- The stove in the Principal's room leads into this small chimney, which is built against the wall on the outside of the school building, and projects three or four feet above the roof.\n\nBoth small jobs can be done by a member of the School Staff.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC. Fant. Schmidt,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nFROM\nThe Office of the Resident Architect\nDEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS\n415 Public Building,\nCalgary, Jan. 26th 1940\n\nSir:\n\nRe: Chimney, St. Cyprian,\nPeigan Reserve,\nBrocket, Alberta.\n\nIn accordance with your request I visited the site of the above mentioned chimney in company with yourself on the 17th instant.\n\nIn view of my findings there and in accordance with information gained through careful study of the plans and specification for the above building, I beg to submit the following:\n\nBEARING:\nThe calculated weight of the chimney is approximately 143000 lbs. The calculated area of the footings is 60 sq.ft. This gives a bearing pressure on the soil of 2400 lbs per sq.ft., approximately which is well within the allowable bearing load on the type of soil found in that locality.\n\nSTABILITY:\nAllowing a wind pressure of 25 lbs. per sq.ft. of surface which is approximately equal to that of 80 mile per hour wind by calculation it is found that the total wind load on the exposed part of the chimney would be 4950 lbs. The overturning moment of such pressure would be 195500 foot lbs. The moment of the mass of the chimney and foundation are considerably more than three times this figure so from this point of view the structure is stable. Further, the resultant of a horizontal force of 4950 lbs and a vertical force of 143000 lbs. falls well within the middle third of the foundation and so the structure is stable.\n\nGUY WIRES:\nWhile it is unusual for masonry chimneys to be reinforced with guy wires I see no harm in leaving the wires as they stand. They are at present rather loose and I do not believe that even in a maximum wind would they be pulled taut. This is a good feature as if tautness occurred at any point during the swaying of the chimney it would cause an impact at the point where the wires are attached to the chimney and might have a damaging effect on masonry. However as they are they undoubtedly take some of the strain due to the wind and have a further stabilizing effect on the stack.\n\nCONDITION OF THE MASONRY:\nThe brick work and mortar are for the most part in a very good state of repair. The flashing at the junction of the roof surface and the chimney is in need of renewing, most of it in fact is not in place at present. I would recommend that this be done immediately.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6370, file 763-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nI would further recommend that the joints in the masonry in the space between the roof and the ceiling be raked out and repointed with a mortar mix made up as follows: To \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) parts of sand and one part of Portland cement add a small amount of water sufficient only to dampen the mix. Allow this mix to stand for from one and one-half to two hours or until the initial set is just taking place. At this time the mix should be re-tempered with water and 20% lime in the form of a paste added to it. Work this mix until it is plastic and use immediately. This will prevent more of the present mortar from falling out of the masonry joints.\n\nI would also recommend that the sump pit located beside the kiln be cleaned out and that a concrete bottom be installed. At present there is no bottom to this sump and a good deal of water is lost into the subsoil structure below the foundations.\n\nFINALLY: It is my considered opinion, in view of the above findings, that the chimney is at present thoroughly stable and in a very good state of repair and that if the above recommendations are carried out it presents no danger whatever to the building or to its occupants.\n\nRegarding the small chimney on the south side of the main building, I would recommend that the loose bricks on top be removed in whole and that a cement cap be installed in their place.\n\nTrusting that this is the information that you require, I am,\n\nYours truly,\n\nChas.

Barlow said that the 7 small extinguishers were no good when they examined them to re-fill them. I had these taken to the Factory Distributors in Calgary, who report that they are worn out from corrosion, inside.\n\nI would strongly urge that these be replaced as soon as possible with new ones of a different make, the present ones are Canadian Fire-Guns. I would ask to be supplied with \"Fyr Fyter\" - new type Model \"A\", the reason that this type does not need refilling every 12 months, this means economy and greater fire protection.\n\nA requisition in triplicate is enclosed.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

As this was not successful we finally resorted to having the freight bill glued to the invoice. Since this last device has been adopted we have found that the freight bills are forwarded to you and payments come through satisfactorily.\n\nFrom the above explanation we think you will see that we have genuinely tried to have your instructions followed out, and the two invoices which date back to November, 1939 we believe are not settled for on account of their being issued before we adopted these later methods of insuring that the freight bill went to the agent and was forwarded to you.\n\nCopies of the two invoices in question amounting to $38.58 are enclosed herewith.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPYRENE MANUFACTURING COMPANY\nof Canada Limited\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Manager.\n\nIndian Affairs.

When this occurred the Principal Mr Barlow informed me that the toilets would not clear, it being an emergency I ordered Mr Pearson to work on the system immediately for the health & continued operation of the school. The ground was frozen, and about 5 feet of the surface earth has to be removed which covers the tank under the ground, both compartments were practically in solid formation, also part of the drain, minor repairs were needed & new wooden shafts from the ground surface to the top of tanks. In future I have requested Mr Barlow to have his staff clean out these tanks, spring and fall to prevent a repetition of this.\n\nIncidentally the plumber was quite sick after working in the septic tank, from the effects of the gases.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. T.W.V. Webb,\nIndian Agent,\nBrocket, Alta.\nOttawa,\nNovember 14, 1941.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nSurveys & Engineering Branch\n\nRe: St. Cyprian Indian Residential School\n\nThe above residential school is in the Peigan Indian Agency at Brocket, Alberta. The Indian Agent is Mr. T.W.V. Webb.\n\nMr. Webb has reported as follows regarding the engine used for operating the electrical plant:\n\n\"The present engine Lister Brunson, 12 H.P. 2 cylinder gasoline is running alright, but for how long I cannot estimate; the last time it was overhauled I believe was in 1936, then the engineer reported that a new one should replace it when it needed another overhaul. This was the same engine type as the Sacred Heart School that we replaced with a Diesel. The proper way I would suggest is that a Department engineer from Banff be sent to give his report to the Department and if he thinks it advisable to replace, the Department would then have competent advice.\n\n\"There is this much that in view of the age of the engine, and the difficulty in getting repairs, also the fact of the Diesel using other fuel than gasoline, it might be advisable to replace this engine this year.\"\nIt would be appreciated if you could arrange to have your engineer visit this school at an early date and report fully regarding the condition of the present engine. If he recommends a new engine full particulars should be given regarding the type of engine required in order that we may supply the necessary details to the Purchasing Branch.\n\nDirector.\nDecember 9, 1941.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Wardle,\nRe: Lighting Plant,\nSt. Cyprian Indian School, Brocket, Alta.\n\nIn reference to your memorandum of the 16th ultimo, an inspection was made on the 2nd instant by Mr. Snelson who was accompanied by Mr. Chadwick. It was found that the engine which was purchased in 1926, is now capable of operating the generator only to 50 per cent of its capacity. Needed repairs are estimated to cost $350.00 and include replacement of governor mechanism, reboiling cylinders and fitting two over-size pistons and rings, adjustment of crank shaft, tightening fly wheel and new spark plugs. This overhaul might extend the life of the unit for ten years.\n\nA comparison of the estimated annual operating costs of the repaired unit and a new Diesel engine are as follows:\n\nPresent Gasoline Engine -\nAnnual fuel cost - $350.00\n5% interest on repairs ($250.00) - 12.50\nTotal ------------------ $362.50\n\nNew Diesel Engine -\nAnnual fuel cost $80.00\n5% interest on cost ($900.00) 45.00\nTotal ------------------ $125.00\n\nThis difference in favour of the latter will in ten years amount to $2,375.00.\n\nIn view of the foregoing and the fact that it will be difficult or probably impossible to get repairs for the gasoline engine, Mr. Snelson recommends that it be replaced with a Type 10-2 Lister Diesel Engine similar in every respect to the engine purchased for the Sacred Heart School at Brocket in 1939. This engine can be mounted on the same base as the old engine without alteration and operates at the same speed. It is hardly likely that any other type or make of engine could be direct-connected to the generator without considerable difficulty.\n\nWe------\n\nJ. M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa,\nOntario.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6370, file 763-5, part 5)\nWe concur in Mr. Snelson's recommendation and suggest that tenders be invited for a type 10-2 Lister Diesel engine to be installed in the school at Brocket to replace the present engine. It is understood that Messrs. Bruce Robinson Electric, Limited, Calgary, are the Alberta representatives of the manufacturer and have such an engine in stock which can be delivered immediately on receipt of an order with priority authorization.\n\nThe cooling water tank 30\" in diameter and 66\" in height is in poor condition, being rusted through in places. It is recommended that it be replaced at the same time.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nChief Engineer.\n15th December, 1941\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill\n\nRe: Lighting Plant, St. Cyprian Indian School, Brocket, Alberta.\n\nIn reply to your memorandum of November 14th relative to the above, I am enclosing for your information copy of a memorandum from the Chief Engineer, Mr. Mills, dated December 9th, which is self-explanatory.\n\nIn view of the fact that it will be difficult, if not impossible, to get repairs for the gasoline engine now in use, and that the savings, which will be effected by the installation of a Diesel engine of the type recommended by Mr. Snelson, will be sufficient to pay for the cost of its installation for three years, Mr. Mills' recommendation to purchase such engine is concurred in.\n\nIt will be noted that the cost of the Diesel engine recommended may be about $900. The cost of the proposed new water tank will probably not be more than $30.\n\nWe should be pleased to be advised if you approve of the installation of a Diesel engine of the type recommended. If so, we will submit specifications for a complete job including supplying both engine and water tank and their installation. Bruce Robinson Electric, Limited, Calgary, which at present appears to be the only firm in a position to supply such an engine, can then be asked to quote a price upon these specifications.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nDecember 18, 1941.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nSurveys & Engineering Branch\n\nRe: Lighting plant, St. Cyprian Indian Residential School, Brocket, Alberta.\n\nI am in receipt of your memorandum of December 15 in which you recommend the purchase of a new type 10-2 Lister Diesel engine. It is noted that you consider this can be purchased at a cost not exceeding $900.00.\n\nPlease submit specifications for a complete job including the supplying of both engine and water tank and their installation. As soon as we have this information the matter will be submitted to the Purchasing Branch.\n\nDirector.\nSpecifications for Diesel Engine and Cooling Water Tank\nfor St. Cyprian Indian Residential School, Brocket, Alberta.\n\nOne - Type 10-2 Lister Diesel Engine. The engine shall be tank cooled and shall be direct-connected to the 6 K.W. 550 R.P.M. generator now installed at the school.\n\nOne - Cylindrical Cooling Water Tank, Diameter 30 inches, height 70 inches.\n\nThe tank shall be constructed of 14 gauge galvanized iron, strengthened at the top with a rim or band of flat iron 1/4\" x 1-1/2\". The bottom of the tank shall be of 3/16\" galvanized plate. If 14 gauge galvanized iron is not available 10 or 12 gauge may be substituted and if no galvanized iron is available, black iron of the same thickness may be substituted provided that after fabrication it is painted inside and outside with a good metal preservative paint such as Kem Kronik or equal.\n\nThe tank shall be tapped at a height of 3 inches above the bottom for a 2-inch outlet pipe and fitted with a 1\u00bd-inch drain plug with nipple and 1\u00bd-inch gate valve in the centre of the bottom. It shall also be tapped 5-inches below the top for a 2-inch inlet pipe. All 2-inch taps as above shall be fitted with removable plugs.\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill\n\nRe: Lighting plant, St. Cyprian Indian School, Brocket, Alta.\n\nIn reply to your memorandum of December 18th last, I am enclosing herewith specifications covering a new engine and cooling water tank to be purchased for the above school.\n\nIn calling for tenders it is presumed that the Departmental Purchasing Agent will advise prospective bidders that their tenders are to be for the engine and water tank installed and in operating condition at St. Cyprian Indian school at Brocket, Alberta.\n\nDirector.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nREQUISITION FOR SUPPLIES File No.\nJanuary 10 1942\n116-1-5\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF St. Cyprian Indian Residential School\n\nVOTE 76 Allotment 18-432\n\nSHIP TO Rev.

It is assumed that the school has got along without this engine and will be able to do so until after the summer vacation.\n\nIn discussing the matter with Mr. Hoey he thought it would be advisable to have Mr. Doucet, if he should visit the west this summer, thoroughly explore the educational system on the Reserve and see if it might not be possible to establish day schools in place of the two residential schools that are there now.\n\nChief Executive Assistant.\n\nOttawa, April 14, 1942.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nLetter No.\n\nOffice of the peigan #116, Indian Agency,\nBrocket, Alta.\n\nApril 9th, 1942\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith Vouchers Nos. 285, amounting to $120.00 in favour of Rev.

He states that he can no longer buy gasoline by the barrel the way he has always done, but must secure same from a retail dealer or filling station, the nearest of which is 15 miles away.\n\nThe gasoline the Principal wants to secure is used for the school car which does any trucking required by the school.\n\nIt is possible that some arrangements might be made where special consideration would be given to our Indian residential schools in view of the fact that the majority of them are located at a considerable distance from either a retail dealer or a filling station. I should appreciate hearing from you in the matter as soon as convenient.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

In his reply just received this morning, he states that he has no knowledge whatever as to how this sum was expended. His letter reads, in part, as follows:\n\n\"We have had no new equipment that I remember, unless it is school material. Neither have we had any improvements, and very few repairs.\"\n\nMr. Barlow admits the possibility that the expenditure may have been made through the local Indian Agent, but if so, he has no knowledge of it, and refers to the possibility that the expenditure may have been made at the R.C. School on the Peigan Reserve instead of his School.\n\nIt will be appreciated if you will let me know exactly how the matter stands.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nSecretary of the Commission.\n\nTBRW:A.\nOttawa,\nAugust 12, 1942.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 8th instant, with reference to the amount provided in the current year's appropriation for repairs, improvements and purchase of new equipment at the St. Cyprian Indian Residential School. Let me assure you that the amount provided is not being spent at any other school. Last January an officer of the Surveys & Engineering Branch visited this school and recommended that a new Lister Diesel engine be supplied. It was not possible to proceed with the purchase of this engine at that time but we are now endeavouring to secure it and, if we do, the amount of $300.00 will be required as part payment and the balance will be taken from a small unallotted amount which we have included in our appropriation. If it is found impossible to secure the engine, due to present conditions, the $300.00 will still be available at the St. Cyprian School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nIn your letter of the 12th ultimo, #116-1-5, you informed me of the steps being taken to provide our St. Cyprian School on the Peigan Reserve with a new Lister diesel engine, and from information which has reached me from the Principal, I gather that this engine is being provided by Mumford-Medland Limited, of Winnipeg.\n\nThe Principal of the School, the Rev. W. Barlow, keenly desires that the old engine be left at the school to operate a chopper which chops feed for the pigs. His letter reads, in part, as follows:\n\n\"We spend about $80.00 to $100.00 per year for chopping, and are dependent on a farmer for this service. We cannot always get him when we want him, and when he does come we have to chop enough for six months. As we are without mice proof storage facilities the mice get in and a quantity of the feed is lost\".\n\nThe Principal's request seems very reasonable to our Commission and if Government regulations will admit of the engine being left at the school for the purpose indicated, I will be obliged if you will notify me to that effect. As it has been, and is still, I believe, the policy of the Government to encourage the raising of hogs for bacon, I will hope that permission to retain the engine at the school may promptly be authorized.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary of the Commission.\n\nTERW:A.\nOttawa, September 8, 1942.\n\nRe: Diesel Engine -\nSt. Cyprian Residential School\n\nDear Doctor Westgate:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 3rd instant in which you intimate that the Principal of the above-noted school is anxious to retain the old engine so that it may be used to operate a chopper.\n\nI have this morning discussed this matter with the Purchasing Agent, and we can see no objection to the proposal submitted by the Principal. It will be in order, therefore, for the Principal to retain this engine for the purposes he has in mind.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. T.B.R. Westgate, D.D.,\nSecretary,\nIndian & Eskimo Residential School Commission, M.S.C.C.,\n38-43 The Bible House,\n184 Alexander Avenue,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\nSir:\n\nMr. Barlow, the principal of St. Cyprian school, has been in to see me with regard to a Diesel Engine which has been shipped to him from Mumford, Medland Ltd of Winnipeg.\n\nThis engine I understand is to replace the one now in use at the school & has been at the local freight shed for some little time.\n\nHe wants to know who is supposed to install this engine & when it will be done. He says the one they are using now is working all right & was wondering if it should not be allowed to continue working as long as it would, or until there was a holiday of a day or two, during which time the switch over could be made.\n\nIf the company furnishing the engine is supposed to install it, this suggestion of Mr. Barlow's would not work out, as the Company no doubt would want payment of their account & we could not very well pass the account for payment, until we were satisfied that the machine was working properly.\n\nI will be glad to receive your instructions in the matter as I can find nothing on the Agency files to guide me, the deal apparently having been negotiated through the church authorities.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ.T. Faunt,\nActing Indian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 21st instant, with reference to the Diesel engine purchased for the St. Cyprian Indian Residential School. I am disturbed by the statement in the second paragraph of your letter that the engine has been at the local freight shed for some little time. A copy of the purchase order was forwarded to the Principal on August 19 and he should have made arrangements to accept delivery of the engine as soon as it reached Brocket. Please let me know why he did not do so.\n\nIt is also difficult to understand your suggestion that the present engine be continued in use, as officials of the Surveys & Engineering Branch and the M.S.C.C. have been urging us for several months past to install a new engine. Recently we received a letter from Rev. T.B.R. Westgate stating that the Principal simply wanted to retain the old engine so that it might be used to operate a chopper. This is expensive equipment that we have supplied, after having had considerable difficulty in obtaining it, and consequently we would like to have a very full report from you regarding the points mentioned in this letter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6370, file 763-5, part 5)\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of October 27th regarding Diesel engine purchased for St. Cyprian school, I beg to advise that I have seen Mr Barlow in regard to the several points mentioned in your letter & he advises me that he did not take delivery of the engine as he figured that there would be someone along to instal the engine as was done at the other school & that there would be no object in handling the thing twice.\n\nHe knows nothing about the installation of such a machine himself & at the present time is without the services of an engineer & is attending to the heating plant himself & also doing his best with the lighting & pumping plant. This new engine weighs somewhere in the neighbourhood of eighteen hundred pounds & the installation of such an expensive piece of machinery is no job to be undertaken by any ordinary layman, especially at this time of year when the lights are on about seventeen hours a day & when a switch over would have to be done quickly & by experts with proper equipment to properly handle the job.\n\nIt was not my suggestion that the present engine be continued in use, but Mr. Barlow's. He says it was not his idea at all that a new engine be installed at this time & that he had suggested that they try to get along with the old engine, especially in times like these when money was so urgently needed in war work, but that if they were bound to have a new engine put in, he would like to have the old engine to operate a feed chopper in connection with his stock raising operations.\n\nI might say that I had already had the machine hauled to the school & it is stored in a shed pending instructions from you & that there is no bill for storage against it.\n\nAs to the condition of the old engine, I don't know a thing about it. It might run for years & it was Mr Barlow's hope that it would at least serve for the duration.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.T.

How many cylinders has it? Is it a full Diesel or a semi-Diesel? Is it radiator cooled or a tank-cooled engine? Is the generator supposed to be direct connected to this engine, - or drive the generator by belts? If it is to be driven by belts, are they to be flat belts or Vee belts?\n\nIf belt drive is to be used, is the Department supplying pulleys?\n\nWhen may we expect this installation work to come up? As you know, we are terribly short of man-power at the present time and we would naturally like a little notice in advance.\n\nIf at all possible, could blue prints or picture with dimensions of engine be supplied?\n\nYours truly,\n\nBRUCE ROBINSON ELECTRIC LTD.\n\n(Sgd.) \"S.

(RG 10, Volume 6370, file 763-5, part 5)\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your No. 116-1-5 of the 20th instant, re engaging a competent man in Calgary to install a new Diesel engine, purchased for St. Cyprian's Indian Residential School at the Peigan Agency, Brocket, Alberta.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that I phoned the Bruce Robinson Electric, Ltd., Calgary, who stated they had a man (or men) who could install Diesel engines. I asked them if they would quote me their rate (price) for labour: This is $1.25 per hour, an 8-hour day, plus expenses - transportation lodging and meals. They stated they could not give me the approximate time it would take to install the engine, unless they knew the type of engine to be installed: If it is to be a replacement, the same as that provided at the Sacred Heart School in 1939 or 1940 - (Ref. Dept. letter #116-1-5 dated Sept. 28, 1939) - it would be an easy matter, as it was just a case of lifting the old engine off the concrete base, and placing the new one thereon, using the same stay-bolts without alteration; also, the generator could be direct-connected, as on the old one, and there were no changes of pulleys to be made.\n\nIf another type of engine has been purchased, it may mean making a new concrete base, and this will mean an extra trip to allow the cement to set; also, will changes have to be made to the pumping pulleys, &c.?\n\nI am enclosing herewith, for your information, copy of a letter received from the Bruce Robinson, Ltd., Service Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC.

Faunt, Acting Indian Agent, Brocket, Alta.\n\nThe Department has not yet received the account covering the cost of the Diesel engine and tank supplied to the St. Cyprian Residential School. A copy of purchase order 14188 was sent to the Principal on August 19. As I understand from previous correspondence that the engine is at the school, although not yet installed in its proper position, I feel that the account should be paid, as money was provided for it in the current year's appropriation. It would, therefore, be appreciated if you would certify the account and forward it for payment.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from Messrs. Mumford, Medland Ltd. of Winnipeg in regard to their account in the amount of $532.00 for Diesel Engine supplied last September to St. Cyprian's school. The engine has never been installed & has been the subject of considerable correspondence between your office, the inspector's office in Calgary & this Agency.\n\nIf the account is not passed for payment immediately, I presume the appropriation would lapse as at March 31st & I cannot very well pass it until I am satisfied that the job is satisfactory.\n\nOf course if Mumford, Medland Ltd., only contracted for delivery of the engine & not for the installation, their contract has been fulfilled as the engine was taken delivery of at the school.\n\nI shall be glad if you will advise me as to what had best be done.\n\nThe Bruce Robinson Electric in Calgary, who apparently had been consulted in the matter, suggested that the installation had best be left until along in the spring, when the shutting down of the plant would not interfere to the same extent with the operation of the school.\n\nJ.T. Faunt,\nActing Indian Agent.\n| DESCRIPTION                                                                 | PRICE   | EXTENSION | DISCOUNT | NET      |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|-----------|----------|----------|\n| LISTER TYPE 10/2 TWIN CYLINDER DIESEL ENGINE,                             |         |           |          |          |\n| DEVELOPING 10 H.P.

Faunt,\nIndian Agent, Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nPeigan Reserve,\nBrocket, Alberta\n\nDear Mr. Faunt:\n\nReferring to your recent visit to the school when you inspected the very bad condition of the floors in the two dormitories.\n\nDue to the fact that new flooring is so urgently needed I hereby make requisition to the Department of Indian Affairs for 2\u00bd\" tongued and grooved flooring of \u00be\" thickness with \u00bc\" tongue, to cover an area of 2000 sq. ft.\n\nI believe it was suggested that paint for the interior of the school be requisitioned from the Department under grant for repairs and improvements, but due to the urgent need for above flooring I would suggest substituting it for the paint.\n\nThe size of the dormitories are as follows:\n\nBoys dorm. 31\u00bd' x 39' = 1228\u00bd sq.ft.\nGirls dorm. 31\u00bd' x 36' = 1134 sq.ft.\n\nTotal = 2362\u00bd sq.ft.\n\nAs above mentioned floors are in such bad condition that there is a danger of damaging the underflooring also if the top flooring is not replaced. I trust that the Department of Indian Affairs will be able to provide this flooring as soon as possible.\n\nThanking you,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nB.S. Greene,\nPrincipal.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6370, file 763-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nDear Mr. Farnet,\n\nI have asked for 2000 ft of flooring hoping to get enough to repair one or two other places where floor is damaged.\n\nB.S.G.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI am enclosing herewith a copy of a letter I have received from the Rev. Mr Greene of St Cyprian's school in which he makes the suggestion that he be authorised to purchase flooring instead of paint as estimated for in the 1942-43 estimates.\n\nThe floors are truly in pretty bad shape, whereas the condition of the paint throughout the building is excellent.\n\nAfter paying for the linoleum which was ordered for this school, I think there should be around $125.00 left of the $300.00 which was allotted and I would suggest that I be authorised to spend this amount & possibly $25.00 more on flooring as requested in Mr Greene's letter.\n\nJ.T.Faunt,\nActing Indian Agent.\nOttawa,\nNovember 2, 1943.\n\nMr. J.T. Faunt, Acting Indian Agent, Brocket, Alta.\n\nI have your letter of the 26th ultimo, with reference to the flooring requested by the Principal of the St. Cyprian Residential School. The Department is prepared to secure the flooring required, but, due to the purchasing regulations, which require all purchases to be made by the Purchasing Branch, it is not possible to give you authority to incur the expenditure. Please forward detailed information regarding the type and quantity of flooring required.\n\nR.A.

Carbon should be removed and the valves checked. The Injector Nozzle should be cleaned and tested as per instruction book supplied with the plant.\"\n\nThis is work which can be done by the mechanic-engineer employed at the school. I understand that a mechanic-engineer has not been employed steadily at your school for some months; I think this is a big mistake; with the expensive machinery (equipment) installed for heating, lighting, pumping, laundry, etc., a competent mechanic should be employed steadily. Of course, it may be that a suitable man could not be found last summer.\n\nI must ask you to please endeavour to get a mechanic as soon as possible, if you have not already done so.\n\nI wish it understood, that we are aware that you have not been in charge, and have not lived at this school before September of this year.\n\nJ.T.

Schmidt Esq., Inspector of Indian Agencies, Calgary, Alta.\n\nThis is to advise you that the man from Bruce, Robinson Electric was down here & installed the new engine at St Cyprian's school & everything there is now running smoothly.\n\nHe reported that two new pinion gears were required for the pump to replace two there now, which are rather badly worn.\n\nI will check on these gears, getting the numbers &c. and will submit a requisition for them.\n\nI would suggest in connection with this school & in view of the expensive nature of the machinery at the school, that pressure be brought to bear on the school authorities to provide a mechanic to properly care for the equipment. They used to have one, but they let him go over a year ago & since that time have been more or less of a nuisance, as they keep calling on me to send Mr McKinon up there to help them out & when he is doing that something else is being neglected.\n\nWhile the man was here I had him check the equipment at the R.C. school & he advises that the pump needs overhauling and also recommends the moving of the storage batteries from where they are at present, to another location.\n\nHe also recommends that both engines be checked each year, valves ground & cleaned &c. but no doubt he will make a full report to his company & you will be furnished with a copy of same.\n\nJ.

I know Mr Barlow was opposed to having the ladder completed, but there was another principal before him and why the building inspector passed the job as complete is beyond me.\n\nI mentioned in my letter of March 22nd that the estimate of cost of the proposed extension seemed exorbitant and I was just wondering if a wooden extension would not serve the purpose just as well & would be much lighter to handle.\n\nJ.T.Faunt,\nActing Indian Agent.\nOttawa,\nApril 17, 1944.\n\nMr. C.P.

These steps are to be 36\" wide and 4\u00bd\" Bolts should run across under treads to hold side strings from warping, these bolts would be about \u00be inches long and could also go through the upright 2 X 4 pieces that hold the hand rail.\n\nThis would make a good strong job. Hand rail could be bolted to these 2 x 4 uprights and the whole thing well painted.

He remarked that there was no need for same to be hung by cable and pulleys provided the outside doors to the dormitories are equipped with an electric alarm bell which would ring immediately the door is opened. He remarked that the airing of the dormitories or the shaking of blankets etc., could be done through open windows.\n\nThe cost of installing the electric alarm will be approximately $20.00, viz:\n\n- Bell wire 2 lbs. @ .60\u00a2 = 1.20\n- Switches 4 only @1.10 = 4.40\n- Labour 8 hours @1.80 = 14.40 $20.00\n\nMr. McMillan stated that he had recently met Mr. Charles Marshall who said he would be able to go to the school and do this work sometime this autumn.\n\nI recommend that authority be granted to have the steps and the electric bell installed.\n\nC.

I visited Mr Sills who was drilling South of Pincher Creek, and he made an inspection of the well, and decided that the well would have to be cleaned out, before he was able to ascertain whether the casing had rotted and water was leaking through and coming into the Boiler Room.\n\nHe advised me that he would clean the well for $100.00 and then further investigation could be made. The Boiler floor has now a hole cut where they can drain the leakage without much trouble, and the chance of any grave danger to the boilers is nil, while this hole is kept empty. May I have the instructions and authority to have the well cleaned out.\n\nAnthony M. [Signature]\nIndian Agent\nCalgary, February 26, 1945.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nRe: Water Supply (well) at St. Cyprian's Indian Residential School, Peigan Indian Agency.\n\nI beg to enclose herewith copy of letter received from Mr. A. McMillan, Indian Agent, re the above. Having nothing on file at this office regarding this well, I went to the School on the 21st instant while at the Agency, to look into the matter. Agent McMillan says that he cannot find anything on file at the Agency office re this well; Rev. B.S. Greene, Principal of the School, gave me the same answer.\n\nThe well is inside the building, in what is referred to as the Engine Room. The lighting plant, batteries, water pump and two pressure tanks are in this room.\n\nI am told that this well was sunk in 1927, the year the School was built, by Mr. Ben Mills of Macleod, Alberta; that 6-inch casing was used for the first 80 feet; then this was reduced to 5-inch for the next 47 feet, which gives a total depth of 127 feet. I was also told that Mr. Mills says he does not remember these details.\n\nThis is an Artesian (flowing) well. The overflow is piped to stock-watering troughs in the barn-yard and pigery; another pipe inside the main building flows into a concrete tank near the kitchen. This is referred to as the \"cooler tank\" for milk cans, etc.; the overflow from this runs into the sewer pipe.\n\nThe seepage or leakage referred to by Mr. McMillan does not come through the boiler-room walls; it appears to come from underneath the floor in the boiler-room, and from the coal bin which adjoins same. These two floors are both on the same level, and are four or more feet below the basement floor level. A hole -- 12\" x 24\" x 14\" deep -- has been cut out in the boiler-room, to catch this water, which is bailed with buckets and poured into a sewer-pipe connection, which is about three to four feet above the floor level. There is no sewerage trap in the floor of the boiler-room.\n\nI am told that between two and three barrels of seepage water are bailed out each day; that the amount of seepage water is now less than it was a month ago; that water has been noticed on the coal bin floor for over a year; that the pressure of the overflow pipe is not as strong as it was before this seepage began to run into the boiler-room, about two months ago.\n\nNo one knows where this water comes from: It is thought that it might be from a perforated well casing, or pressure from the bottom of the well which soaked the soil outside the casing, and after years has found a passage near the surface, and seeps through the floor cracks and between the edge of the floor and boiler-room basement wall, which is not water-tight.\n\n(OVER)\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6370, file 763-5, part 6)\nIf the seepage becomes worse, it will be necessary to have someone on hand continually to look after the bailing. Otherwise there is danger of it getting under the steam heating boiler, and into the fire box.\n\nAs regards the dirty condition of the water, mentioned by Agent McMillan: I think that this is caused by dirt (silt) in the pressure tanks, as the water becomes clean after flowing through the taps for a few minutes.\n\nI consider this matter quite serious and recommend that arrangements be made with the Surveys and Engineering Branch to have one of their engineers go to Brocket as soon as possible (immediately) to look into the matter.\n\nC.

I stated that I insisted on the fire escape stair-case being put in, and that while I did not think that the cost of same -- $80.00 -- would be charged to the amount of $300.00 allowed this school, as stated on the requisition, I would mention same when submitting the requisition to the Department.\n\nIf funds are available, I recommend that the requisition be approved.\n\nC.

The 30\" x 72\" engine water cooling tank is in good condition.\n\nGENERATOR\n\nThe generator is rated 55 Amperes @ 110 volts, 550 R.P.M.; as the present load reaches a peak of only 20 amperes when all lights are on, it will be apparent that there is ample reserve power in the generator.\n\nThe 56 Cell battery is in very good condition.\n\nTwo pressure tanks of 4' diam. x 10' long are placed horizontally, one directly above the other. They are connected and when the tanks are filled to a 40 P.S.I. pressure the upper tank contains approximately 80% air and 20% water, while the lower tank contains 100% water. These tanks are in good condition except that the 4\" pipe cleanout of the upper tank leaks and should be re-threaded and possibly fitted with a new 4\" cap. These tanks should be cleaned out.\n\nThe Pump Jack made by F. and W. Mfg. Co. of Kendalville, Indiana is in fair condition. Guides and gears are not much worn.\n\nFire Hoses. There are two 1\u00bd\" fire hose valves with fire hoses attached on each of the four floors - eight 1\u00bd\" firehose s in the building. The hoses look like they might leak in an emergency and should have a periodical test.\n\nAll Plumbing, Toilets, Baths, Sinks, etc., seem to be in serviceable condition.\n\nThe building as a whole seems in good condition; no serious sags or cracks apparent anywhere. However, it could do with paint both inside and out.\n\nThe Septic Tank was inspected. It should be cleaned out; this has not been done for some 5 years. It is, apparently structurally in good condition.\n\nThe Boiler is a Pascal portable straight draft made by the Port Arthur Ship Building Co. Ltd., Port Arthur, Ontario. is in satisfactory condition.\n\nThe Well is reported to be 100 feet deep. Water will flow out of the top of the drop pipe.\n\nThe Laundry is equipped with a rotary washer and a Centrifugal dryer. All ironing is done with sad irons heated on a stove.\n\nNo electrical appliances other than two small radios and one electric iron are connected to the electrical system.\n\nThe set of photos made on this inspection will follow within the week.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Considerable quantities of water also seeped into the coal bin through breaks in the concrete floor and through cracks in the coal bin wall nearest the boiler.\n\nThis leakage ceased to such an extent that in January, 1945, only 8 barrels per day were dipped out of the boiler room floor.\n\nOn inspection very little leakage was found except from the charge of the pump, boiler, etc., but there is generally no bailing from the sump for leakage or flow fluctuates and is apparently not affected by changes in outside temperatures, nor does it increase by days of heavy water use as on laundry days.\n\nWhen the pump is not in operation water flows out of the pipe (s) into a 12\" pipe that flows down to the stock watering trough near the pig pens. The pipe is approximately 30\" high by 72\" long and contains milk, butter, etc. It was stated by Mr. Green, that the flow of water was excessive through the boiler room occurred \u2014 filled a large tank with the amount flowing into the boiler room.\n\nThe artesian flow which enters the tank and to the stock watering point below the pump head is said to occur through a crack in the wall of the building, other than water from the boiler room.\n\nIndian Affairs.

H.A. Alderwood, D.D.,\nSecretary,\nThe Bible House, Alexander Ave., E.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nDear Dr. Alderwood:\n\nI am sorry to have to report that the Principal's apartment here makes a very unsatisfactory dwelling place and as the Indian Affairs Branch is making a lot of changes at this Agency for Mr. MacMillan, the new Indian Agent, I would suggest that the Commission press the Department for a separate residence for the School Principal.\n\nI had hoped to put up with conditions as they are until after the war, but I am afraid they are too unsatisfactory for the following reasons;\n\n1. Directly under the apartment the Girls' Day Room is situated and over the apartment are the work rooms, and in a frame building such as this the noise from these two departments is indescribable. We have tried to bear with this condition, but over a period of time it is gradually wearing us down. The baby is unable to get the required amount of sleep which also effects Mrs. Greene and myself. The children are continually told to keep quiet which is not fair to them or the staff. You will remember that the children were suppressed under the last Principal with very unsatisfactory results.\n\n2. The apartment is very drafty and cold and no amount of steam will heat it in this windy climate. At times we have to close all the doors between the rooms and live in the kitchen. The three of us have had continual colds all winter and this over a period of time is unhealthy and another winter under these conditions is extremely unpleasant to contemplate.\n\n3. The Principal's apartment takes up at least half of the main floor and as this space is badly required for school purposes it would be an advantage to the school if the Principal was housed in a separate building.\n\nThese conditions were pointed out to Bishop Ragg, when he was here and he will be able to give you more details when he visits Winnipeg next month.\n\nWith kindest regards,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nB. S. GREENE\nPrincipal.\nApril 20, 1945.\n\nAttention Mr. Philip Phelan\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nI beg to enclose copy of letter received from our Principal at the above School, Rev. B.S. Greene.\n\nThis request for a separate Principal's residence was considered by our Commission and was warmly endorsed. I am, therefore, directed to bring the matter to the attention of the branch and to urge that that it be given consideration in your building program.\n\nMay I add my personal support to this request. I do not know another school in which the Principal and his wife have to live in such difficult circumstances. If the children have their periods of freedom that are so essential to their happiness the noise is frequently very considerable. Whereas, in this case there is a young baby to be considered, the matter becomes even more difficult. There is the further consideration urged by Mr. Greene that the space is in the very heart of the school and could be used to very good advantage if it were possible for the quarters to be vacated.\n\nCommending this matter to your earnest consideration,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nHAA/MER Enc.\nOttawa, April 25, 1945.\n\nDear Doctor Alderwood:\n\nI have your letter of the 20th instant, with reference to Reverend Mr. Greene's request for the erection of a Principal's residence at the St. Cyprian Indian Residential School.\n\nNo funds were provided in the current year's appropriation for the cost of such a building. Under these circumstances, it is not possible to give favourable consideration to Mr. Greene's request. I discussed the contents of your letter with Mr. Hoey, who suggested that on the occasion of your next visit to the Department you might again take up the matter with the officials here.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

We realize that it may not be possible to take action in the current year, but it was our hope that the matter might be given favorable consideration in connection with the extensive post-war building program which we have been lead to believe is being planned.

McMillan Agent\nIndian Affairs Branch Dept of Mines and Resources Ottawa.\n\nI beg to advise further to Inspector Schmidt's visit to this Agency, when the report of Mr. Snelson Engineer from Banff was discussed, in which he recommended the cleaning out of the Septic Tank at St Cyprians School.\n\nI took this matter up with Mr Pearson the Plumber in Pincher Creek and checked up on the last time this tank was cleaned out approximately five years ago; Mr Pearson will do this work for $65.00. At the same time on a trip to the School this week it was found that the sewage pipe running under the basement floor of this School was blocked and this was also taken up with Mr Pearson; as the work may be easy, and also may necessitate the taking up of the concrete floor, Mr Pearson quoted approximately $40.00. This would make a total of $125.00. He advised me that the cleaning out of the sewage would only be charged for the work done, I will try to keep this as low as possible.\n\nAs this is not an emergency yet I would be glad to receive the authority as soon as possible.\n\nRegarding the well I have contacted Joe Maughan at Macleod, and he is coming out to look at the well, and advise if the work needed can be done by his outfit, if so a quotation will be given.\n\nAnthony McMillan\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Cleaning of Septic Tank at Cyprian Residential School.\n\nPeigan Indian Agency,\n\nReferring yours No.116-1-5 of April 3rd last: I beg to report that I visited the school April 19th with Mr A. McMillan when we discussed the matter with Rev. B.S. Greene the Principal and I asked that the tank be cleaned as soon as possible.\n\nI am enclosing herewith Copy of a letter received from Mr McMillan on the matter, which is self-explanatory.\n\nRev. B.S. Greene has not the equipment, rods & tools to clean out the Sewer Pipes which is partly plugged. Mr S. Pearson of Pincher Creek is prepared to do the work and recommends going over the whole system i.e. all pipes & traps in the building etc., while he is at the school. Or in other words make a thorough job of the whole system and thereby save the expense of making extra trips to do different jobs at different times. He remarked that he is very busy and cannot always get away when needed.\n\nI recommend that Authority be granted to have the whole system cleaned at a cost of approximately $125.00 and that Indian Agent Mr McMillan be authorized by Air Mail to have the work done at once.\n\nThe blockage of the Sewer Pipe is becoming worse.\n\nC. Pant. Schmidt,\nInspector of Indian Agencies (Alberta)\nOttawa, June 20, 1945.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nMr. A. McMillan, Indian Agent,\nBrocket, Alberta.\n\nWith reference to the cleaning of the septic tank at the St. Cyprian Indian Residential School, the Department approves an expenditure not exceeding $125.00. This is the amount mentioned in your letter of April 28, which has been forwarded to this office by Inspector Schmidt.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nCOPY SENT TO INSPECTOR SCHMIDT\nI beg to advise further to the report of Mr. Snelson, Engineer, Banff, and the blue print you left with me at the Office for my information, I today went to Pincher Creek, and interviewed Mr. Fraser who is now in the dry goods business, and who looked over the blue print, and advised me to see his partner, Mr. Buchan.\n\nI then went to the Plumber, Mr. Pearson, and found that Mr. Buchan was there, and discussed the whole matter with him and Mr. Pearson; I found that Mr. Buchan was busy and would be unable to do anything before July 1st, however he looked over the plans as did Mr. Pearson, and after considerable discussion the following is a resume of the discussion.\n\nIn discussing the main point was Paragraph 7 of Mr. Snelson's report, and after this paragraph had been looked over both parties, considered firstly, that the expense would be quite heavy, in sinking an inspection shaft as all the earth after the perpendicular portion of the shaft had been dug, would be rough digging, meaning that every bit of dirt would have to be removed through the original opening, and if any trouble was found around the outside of the pipe and grouting was necessary, this would be very difficult to do unless the water could be held back. Mr. Buchan advising me that if the water was coming up the inside between the earth and the casing it would be very difficult to grout if water was coming up in any quantity, as the cement would not have a chance to settle and harden, and if it did not then would mean that the casing would be there for keeps and could never be pulled out.\n\nThe Plumber, Mr. Pearson, suggested that as the possibility of after the inspection shaft has been dug that the leak may be hard to locate, as stated above it might be very expensive to take care of and might not be success, that the following means of finding cure of this which might be cheaper and more satisfactory; would be on the basis of the third suggestion in Para. 7 of Mr. Snelson's letter, that is place an electric automatic pump in the boiler room, enlarge the sump in depth, and connect the pump with the trap on the wall, thus allowing all the leakage to drain into the sump and when it gets to the level the Automatic switch could start the electric pump and discharge the water in the sump into the sewer thus letting it run away.\n\nHe also made a further suggestion that the well be cleaned out and after all the sand and mud has been cleaned out and the well is running over as it did originally, that two cisterns be built for the water to flow into below the level of the overflow into the dairy, so that when the water reaches the upper portion of the cisterns the overflow can then run into the Cooler in the Dairy. A small electric pump would then pump the water from the cistern into the Tanks and after using one cistern for a period of time closed off and the sand cleared out and while this is being done the other cistern can be of use. Mr. Pearson advises that when out checking the pump leather at this school one month ago, he found that what little damage done to the leathers was from sand. He also states that the sand passing through the pump is filling up the Tanks in the School where it is now being pumped to. The Pump and equipment which has only one;\n\n(over)\nlength in the well is built for a well of 3 or four hundred feet, and is much too large for well which is almost a flowing well. He advises that when the Pump Leathers were checked the water was flowing into the Coller in the Dairy of its own accord.\n\nIt would seem from the opinions of the parties I have seen, that some thought should be given to the suggestion of the Automatic Electric Pump placed in the boiler room to keep the sump there cleaned out. This would take care of any danger of a large amount of water gathering in the Boiler Room.\n\nWith Mr. Buchan not available to work on an Inspection shaft till July 1st, but agreeable then to make the shaft and take care of the Bracing of the basement above the open hole, I would be glad if I could be advised if it is your wish to go ahead with the shaft, when I would contact Mr. Buchan for a tender for this work.\n\nMr. Bradley who you mentioned to me verbally has not come through this way yet, and the Mr. Fraser he mentioned is the partner in the Fraser & Buchan Contractors, Fincher Creek; but having purchased a Dry Goods store, leaves all the contracting business to Mr. Buchan.\n\n(Sgd.) \"ANTHONY McMILLAN\"\n\nIndian Agent.\nCalgary, June 22nd, 1945.\n\nSurveys & Engineering Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources, BANFF, Alta.\n\nRe: Underground Leakage from Water Supply (well)\nat the St. Cyprian Indian Residential School\non the Peigan Indian Reserve, Brocket, Alta.\n(Ref. your File No. 68-38, of March 23, 1945)\n\nFurther to my conversation with your Mr. W.M.\nSmelson in this office on May 1st, last, re digging an\ninspection shaft under the floor of the pump house to\ntry and locate the leakage, &c., I beg to enclose here-\nwith copy of a report received from Mr. A. McMillan,\nIndian Agent at Brocket.\n\nAfter an absence of several weeks from this\noffice, I went to the Peigan Agency on the 16th instant\nand talked the matter over with Mr. J. Pearson, Plumber\nof Pincher Creek, who says he thinks his opinion is that\nit will be most difficult and costly to dig an inspect-\nion shaft, and it will be difficult to pour in cement\ngrouting. He suggests making a concrete reservoir and\nletting the water flow into same to settle; and from\nthere to put clear water into the pressure tank.\n(Vide Paragraph 5 of Mr. McMillan's letter). This\nplan is to overcome deposits of silt or sand in the\npressure tank, and through the water system and sewer-\nage pipes in the building.\n\nYou will note by Mr. McMillan's letter that\nthe question of installing an electric pump to keep the\nsurface of the boiler room floor clear of water is men-\ntioned.\n\nAll this does not solve the leakage from the\nwell, the stopping of which is, in my opinion, the most\nimportant thing to do.\n\nYou will also note from Mr. McMillan's report\nthat there is only one length of pump pipe in the well\n(approximately 16 to 20 feet).\n\nIn conversation I was told that the sand in\nthe casing is now only sixty (60) feet from the surface.\n\nThe Principal told me that the pump cylinder\nleathers, which were changed less than two months ago,\nare again cut by sand or silt.\n\nMr. Joseph Maughan, Jr., well driller from\nLethbridge, Alberta, arrived with his drilling outfit\non the morning of the 21st instant at the R.C. Indian\nResidential School on the Peigan Reserve -- 4 miles\north-east from St. Cyprian's School. He is to drill\na new well at the R.C. School, and will be there four\nor five days. Do you not think that he should be asked\nto clean out St. Cyprian's school well before he leaves\nthe Reserve?\n\n(OVER)\nI would ask that Mr. Snelson be asked to contact Mr. Joseph Maughan by telephone at the R.C. Residential School at Brocket and find out how long he will be at the school, and I would also ask that Mr. Snelson go to Brocket and Pincher Creek and interview Mr. MacMillan and Mr. Pearson regarding this well, and arrange to have the work done during the summer vacations, while the pupils are at their homes on the reserve.\n\nC. Pant. Schmidt,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\nMemorandum:\n\nReport on Inspection of St. Cyprian Indian Residential School, June 26th, 1945.\n\nOn the 22nd instant Mr. C.P. Schmidt, requested by telephone that I visit the St. Cyprian School and the Brocket Agency, and while there contact Mr. J. Maughan, well driller, with regard to having him clean the sand out of the well at the St. Cyprian School, while he was in that immediate vicinity; also to contact Mr. Pearson, plumber of Pincher Creek with reference to repairs to pressure tank blow off and the possible installation of a sump pump in the boiler room of the St. Cyprian School.\n\nI met Mr. Maughan in the Queens Hotel, Macleod, on the 25th instant. He agreed to clean the well for the sum of $100.00 to $180.00 depending on difficulties encountered. This agreement was contingent upon Mr. Maughan getting authority to clean the well before June 28th. On the 26th instant, Mr. Schmidt advised me that he had wired Mr. McMillan, Indian Agent at Brocket, Alberta, authority to arrange with Mr. Maughan for the immediate cleaning of the well.\n\nI advised Mr. Schmidt that I would recommend, for the present, that the well be cleaned; such cleaning should provide free enough passage for the water up the pipe, so that there would be very little, if any, leakage coming up along the outside of the casing. If such proves to be true, then all that may be necessary for the future, will be the installation of a small sump pump to keep any seepage out of the boiler room. This pump can be installed for approximately $100.00 including labour and material.\n\nWhether or not it will be necessary to sink an inspection shaft under the pump house to determine position or source of leak will depend on conditions as observed after the well has been cleaned. The repairs to the blow off from the upper pressure tank will cost approximately $20.00 for a new 4\" nipple to be welded to the tank.\n\nI attach hereto a stenographer's memo. of my report to Mr. Schmidt on the afternoon of June 26th.\n\nI asked Mr. Schmidt to advise me a day or two in advance so that I could be present when the well was cleaned.\n\nC.M.

Snelson of the Surveys and Engineering Branch, Banff, called at this office on his return from Brocket today. He says:\n\n\"I met Mr. Vaughan at MacLeod yesterday; he agreed to clean the well for the sum of from $100.00 to $150.00, depending on the difficulties encountered; and providing such drilling contract could be given him within the next day or so, or before he moved his equipment South.\n\n\"I visited Mr. MacMillan at the Indian Agency, and talked over the situation in general with him, and explained that I would recommend, for the present, that the well be cleaned; such cleaning may provide free enough passage for the water up the pipe so that there will be very little leakage, if any, around the outside. If such is the case, all that may be necessary in the future, is to provide a small motor pump for the installation in the boiler room; this can be installed \u2014 equipment and labour\u2014 for from $90.00 to $100.00.\n\n\"I discussed with Mr. Pearson, Plumber, at Pincher Creek, as to whether or not he could fix the blow-off on the upper pressure tank: The threads on this blow-off had become stripped so that the tap is stuck on with difficulty. Mr. Pearson said this could be fixed by welding another nipple onto the pipe which contains the stripped threads. This would entail for him to bring an acetylene welder and tank down to the school and back. He considered that this repair \u2014 labour plus material \u2014 would run from $15.00 to $20.00.\n\n\"I would recommend that no further action be taken with reference to the inspection shaft mentioned in my letter of March 23rd, 1945, until such time as results from the cleaning of the well have been observed.\"\n\nIndian Affairs.

This matter will be taken care of early in July.\n\nAuthority was also received to go ahead with the cleaning out of the Septic tank, and the cleaning out of the sewage pipes under the School basement. This work should be done early in July.\n\nClosing exercises were held at the School on June 28th when a short programme and presentation of Prizes, along with a dinner at which I attended.

No one seems to know the exact depth, there was only light silt and stale black mud in 1942. The well now is not in very good shape, as to well casing, the flow seems to be holding up yet.\n\nThe well head also caused us trouble as the stud bolts are getting very rusty and its hard to make a seal.\n\nHoping this information is what you are after. If any questions I'd be glad to answer. Hoping to be of service to you.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd.) \"W.W.

The pump head and jack were removed from the top of the casing, and a length of 30\" pump barrel and cylinder and 8 feet of 4\" pipe below the cylinder, pulled out of the well casing.\n\nThe boiler was then run several times and cleaned some sand and silt out of the well to a depth of 68 feet below the outside ground level. At this depth some obstruction prevented the boiler from running any deeper in the well. The boiler was then removed and a drill string run into the well for the purpose of loosening up the obstruction, supposed to be hard pan. The drilling was continued for some twenty minutes without any footage whatever being gained. The drill was just bouncing back from some very solid obstruction. The driller was of the opinion that this obstruction was a break in the well casing, as he had experienced no difficulty whatever in running the boiler to the bottom of the well, 180 feet, when he had cleaned this well in 1942. Mr. Maclean stated that it was impossible to attempt to drill further as the drill was getting stuck in the distorted casing and that further drilling might result in losing the artesian flow of the well.\n\nThe flow of the well was apparently the same after drilling operations as before, but, in the opinion of the school caretaker, not so much as after the well was cleaned in 1942. The 38 feet of mud and sand remaining in the casing below the break at 68 feet would certainly reduce the flow of the well from what it was with a clean hole. I would, therefore, recommend that nothing further be done to this well for the present and that a sump pump be installed at once in the boiler room.\n\nEstimated Cost of Sump Pump Installed.\n\n1 - only Atlas Automatic Electric Cellar Drainer, fitted with 1/4 horse-power, 110 volt, Direct Current Motor.

As your current consumption now is exceptionally heavy we would like to suggest that you check into this and curtail the use of current as much as you possibly can, otherwise you will find the battery much too small for your requirements and it will not give the service you would reasonably expect.\n\nIn checking the battery at the St. Cyprian Residential School, serial #9203, type GDL3, purchased in 1940, we found it to be in excellent condition, well taken care of and there is no question that it will deliver the guaranteed service of seven years.\n\nThe battery installed at the Sacred Heart Residential School, serial #9204, type GDL3, 56 cell, purchased in 1940, while it is not in as good a condition as the installation in the St. Cyprian School it now appears to be getting good attention. Furthermore, it has been moved to a new location which will help considerably and the operator is now giving the battery every attention.\n\nYours truly,\n\nGLOBELITE BATTERIES LIMITED\n\nSales Manager.\n\nWESTERN CANADA'S LARGEST BATTERY MANUFACTURERS\nOttawa, November 2, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT.\n\nI attach account amounting to $132.14, covering the cost of emergency repairs to the pressure tanks and plumbing at the St. Cyprian Indian Residential School.

(RG 10, Volume 6370, file 763-5, part 6)\nSir,\n\nRe: St Cyprians Indian Residential Well and Water Supply.\n\nI beg to make the following report on the well at the St Cyprians Anglican School Peigan Agency Brocket.\n\nHistory Since Cleaning out\n\nSince this well was cleaned out early in August, it has given fair satisfaction, until early in November when the well stopped pumping. The Farm Instructor gave the Pump Rod a blow with a hammer releasing the plunger which was seized and the pump again started to pull water. This carried on till the end of November. As it seized, this again was released and pumped for a few days. On December 1st the plunger again seized and the Plumber again sent out his man to look it over, the leathers were badly cut with sand but after putting it together with new Leathers it pumped the tank full to a Forty Pound Pressure; On the morning of the 2nd it again would not pump and the Plumber S Pearson came out with his man, and after considerable work again got the Pump going again this time it only worked for a short period, and then seized again, the spent the balance of the day trying to take the Pump rods out but to no avail, they reported to me that night and I contacted Mr W Maughan of Lethbridge who cleaned out the well, and he said he would come out with his truck and five ton wench, this he did on the morning of the 3rd, and with the full power of the winch, and four men on a cropper we were able to pull the Pump rods which were unmovable owing to the plunger with leathers being tightly seized by sand.\n\nWork done.\n\nAfter pulling the Pump rods and plunger and getting the top valve out, I held a discussion with Mr Pearson and Mr Maughan, regarding the best way to continue a flow of water into the School through the tanks. It was decided the only way to get water through to the tanks would be an Electric Pump of a small type, which would go into the Four Inch Pump Casing, and pump from the surface of the well, this would take a longer time to pump but would not agitate the water in the well thus keeping the sand from being stirred up and clogging. This is being installed today and a further report on results will be made.\n\nCondition of Well.\n\nMr Maughan's opinion.\n\nThe check up of this well since I cleaned it out early in August, and made my report to the Surveys and Engineering Branch at Banff Alberta in which I stated that the well would never be satisfactory and that the casing was dotted at 55 feet, and broken off, on this visit a Qrench attached to string was dropped down the well and the lowest it would go was 78 feet.\n\nCopies Inspector C P Schmidt Calgary, Surveys & Engineering Branch Banff.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6370, file 763-5, part 6)\nMr Maughan's Opinion (Contd).\n\nHe advises that the large pump now in use will never be able to work owing to the strong agitation causing the sand and mud to come up in the casing, damaging the leather on the plunger in one pumping. The water still trickles over the casing and runs into the Dairy and Barns. In mentioning the advisability of drilling a new well, he stated that the old well would have to be cemented off; this he figured would force the cement up outside the casing and would gradually work up through the cracks in the Boiler room racks closing them off. I understand that the only outfit who can do this is Halliburton Bros Turner Valley, and their price would almost be prohibitive.\n\nMr Pearson's Opinion.\n\nMr Pearson who today completed the installation of the Electric Pump, placed the one inch suction in the well to the depth of Ten Feet, but after a trial run of one hour found it was still bringing up sand and silt, and the water was dirty. He cut this pipe to five feet and again installed the Pump with the five feet of suction pipe, and tried pumping for approximately two hours, when it was found that the water coming through the Pump into the tanks was clear, while at the School I watched the Pump running and saw that the water in the well had only receded two feet from the surface of the well, thus leaving a depth of three feet of suction pipe continuously under water, this never varied for a period of three to four hours had not changed. Mr Pearson is satisfied that this is the most economic manner to provide water for the School, and is opposed to the drilling of a new well, which if done might have the same Sandy bottom as we have in the present well. As this well now stands it would be possible to keep a pressure of 35 lbs, with an automatic start at twenty-three lbs. This of course would give a pressure strong enough for the use of the fire Hoses, but would not be able to keep the volume up for use in the case of fires, but should keep the School on a very satisfactory basis with the overflow to the Barn and Dairy running when the pump is not working. Mr Pearson also advised me that a year after the well was drilled some 19 years ago, he was called to clean the sand out of the tanks.\n\nAgent's Comment.\n\nI kept in close contact all the time this work was being done, and I feel on the results to date that Mr Pearson is correct in his opinion, that expenditure on a new well would be very foolish.\n\nI would recommend that the present set up, as completed be left as it is till Spring if it proves a success, when the whole system as at present, and future action be placed in the hands of an Engineer of the Waters Branch, this will give time to see the results of the installation of the Electric Pump, and would also be early enough if any change of policy was considered, to have the work done during the summer holidays when the school is almost empty. As this work was a necessary emergency, owing to the time of year, and the risk of accidents to equipment from lack of water in the Boilers, I trust that the Dept will concur in the action I have Taken. Vouchers for work done will be forwarded as soon as received.\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nLog December 6th. Accompanied by Mr Mc Kinnon I went to the School and made a check on the way the new installation was working and found the School using the maximum amount of water they would at any time with the Laundries and baths being used and found the pump was supplying.\nwas supplying all the water needed and maintaining normal pressure, this would mean that the change over was handling the water question of the School satisfactorily. The water coming through the tap at the pump was perfectly clear from sand or silt; also the water coming through the taps in the School was still dirty most likely from the silt laying in the mains. The Principal advised me that the water was clearer than at any time during his regime.\n\nI.A.\n\nDecember 7th. Another visit was made this morning and the Gauge Checked and found it around 40 Lbs, washing was still in progress, and the water was handling everything perfectly, and Water through the taps in the School was practically clear, and I would complete this report by saying the water system at present is in better shape than it has been for a considerable time.\n\nI.A.\nOttawa, December 14, 1945.\n\nMr. A.

On the 3rd, 4th and 5th ultimo, the wages were for two Plumbers at $1.15 per hour.\n\n(b) The Electric pump was a Duro - 303 capable of 250 Gallons per hour, with the cost of a \u00bd Horse Poer Engine attached to Batteries, this originally was a 32 Volt Motor and had to be attached to the Batteries for the first week while a 110 Motor was being ordered, it was two weeks before the change could be made, and a charge was made for the 32 Volt Motor. This Motor and pump has an automatic Control. The necessity of changing to the 110 was caused by the 32 Volt motor having to be attached to 16 Batteries each morning, while the 110 Motor runs right off the Engine.\n\nI trust that this is the necessary information you will need.\n\nAnthony McMullan\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, 15th January, 1946.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT\n\nRe: Account of S.

I would recommend if Estimates for 1945-1946 are available that this be done before the end of the Fiscal Year, preferably February as Carpenter Labor will be hard to get after Spring opens for inside work.\n\nAnthony McMillan\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, 24th January, 1946.\n\nMr. A.

For a considerable time during this quarter it was found that he was very seldom available on my visits, this culminated with my taking this matter up with the Secretary of the Synod who happened to call at my home, when I found that his private life had forced the executive of the Synod to have him up before them, this they did and while there tended his resignation and left the School the following day, he was however replaced by Chas S Middleton from Cardston who took over and is given every satisfaction.\n\nDuring this quarter the well again gave very serious results, and on going to the School with the plumber, I found the Tanks almost empty, and no action being taken as the Farm Instructor who acts as Engineer was on leave. Mr Pearson along with Mr Maughan cleaned out the well plunger, and after considerable discussion decided it would be best to install an electric pump with a very short length of pipe this has proved successful to date.\n\nA complete report has gone forward on this.\n\nAnthony McMillan,\nIndian Agent.\n19/3/46:\n\nDept of Mines & Natural Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nper/A.

This was done during this quarter when Rev. M. S. V. Cole was appointed. He has shown great interest in his work, and seems very keen in putting the School in good shape, and looking after the interest of his pupils.\n\nThe changes made last quarter regarding well is still proving very satisfactory, with the water clear and a sufficient supply to take care of the needs of the school.\n\nConsiderable small repairs have been suggested by the new Principal, and I have advised him that I will take up these matters after the new fiscal year comes in.\n\nAnthony McMillan, Indian Agent\nBrocket, Alta.\nIndian Affairs Branch Dept of mines & Resources Ottawa.\n\nI beg to advise that a short time ago when Dr Alderwood Secretary I R S Commission was visiting this Reserve, the question of moving the Church of England Mission House from the present location to the School grounds was discussed, and I was asked regarding whether the Department would be agreeable to take this over after it was moved to the School grounds, as Gov. Property and pay the cost of making the house habitable. I advised Dr Alderwood to take the matter up direct, and have the Rev Cole get quotations re the cost of making the house satisfactory to live in.\n\nRev Cole first of all brought in a quotation of his own figures, amounting to $525.00; I advised him that this was away below the cost of the work he intended to do, and asked for information on a rough Estimate covering; MOVING? Digging and making concrete Basement; Incidental Repairs; and plumbing and lighting Fixtures with connections to sewer and water; I found this amounted to \u00a31250.00. This I am satisfied would be a correct figure to consider.\n\nIf the Dept considers this Offer, which would give either a Principals Residence, or a FarmInstructors House may I be advised, when I will get concrete figures to place before you to cover the prices for the work considered necessary., Mayxixkm\n\nI did show in last years Estimates, $6000.00 for a House for the Principal of the School.\n\nAnthony M Millar\nIndian Agent.\n\nCopy to Inspector.\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER FROM A. MCMILLAN, Indian Agent,\nPeigan Indian Agency, Brocket, Alberta, dated May 28, 1946.\n\nOriginal on 600172\n\nI beg to request that I may be advised the amount allowed under the following headings in this year's Estimates:-\n\nSacred Heart School\n\nSt. Cyprian School\nOttawa, June 5, 1946.\n\nMr. A. McMillan, Indian Agent,\nBrocket, Alberta.\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo, with reference to moving the Church of England Mission House from its present location to the grounds of the St. Cyprian Residential School.\n\nYou may obtain concrete figures to place before us, but I trust the cost will not exceed $1,250.00. When submitting the prices for any materials required, you should state if they can be secured locally and, if so, the name and address of the person from whom they can be purchased. I would also like to know the size of the house. I presume that you consider a $1,250.00 expenditure would be to our advantage.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nCalgary, June 7th, 1946.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nOn my visit to the Peigan Agency in May, the Agent and the Principal of St. Cyprian's Anglican Residential School had me look over the Church of England Mission House, now vacant, which was formerly occupied by the late Rev. Canon Haynes.\n\nThis is a well-built, 6-roomed cottage, and is still in reasonably good condition.\n\nIt is understood that Dr. Alderwood, Secretary of the M.S.C.C., wished to have this moved from its present location onto the School property, where it might be used as a residence for either the Principal or the Farmer.\n\nOn reference to the Estimates of expenditures for education on this Reserve, it is noted that the sum of $6,000.00 was inserted on Page 11, for the erection of a residence at St. Cyprian's.\n\nIt was understood that the Church authorities would be prepared to turn this cottage over to our Department, provided the cost of moving, &c., would be borne by us. This house would take the place of that which was included in the Estimates.\n\nIndian Agent McMillan has submitted an Estimate of $1250.00 to cover the cost of moving, digging and making a concrete foundation, and incidental repairs -- plumbing to connect with the sewerage system, lighting fixtures, &c...\n\nUndoubtedly there is a need for such a building at this School, and as it stands, the house is of little or no value to anybody. If it is the policy to enlarge the residential school unit, I recommend that\n\n(OVER)\nthe Church authorities be contacted to ascertain if they wish to offer the building on the conditions set out herein.\n\nG.

Lockers for Boys Play Room. 30 required. $100.00\n   Lockers for girls playroom. 30 required. $100.00\n\n2. Outside door into playground to be re hung on the inside this door is constantly banging in the wind, and is menace to the children's hands. $25.00\n\n3. Compression Tank in Boiler Room has sprung a leak and should be welded. $20.00\n\n4. Boys Dormitory to be refloored. some Lumber is on hand, and the necessary lumber and Labor. $300.00\n\n5. Boiler Grates, (this has already been ordered on an emergency but no answer so far.) $75.00\n\n6. Grates for Jacket Heater & ordered but not yet received. $20.00\n\n$640.00\n\nIn connection with the question of the moving of the house already written about, and which is awaiting an answer from me I have contacted the Principal, and the house has been moved and paid by the Commission. However they found the Basement dug was too large for the House, and with the shortness of Cement, they are doing nothing more until this can be got, so that this will hang over till they are able to complete the work.\n\nA further note was added to the request for the above drawing the attention of the necessity of two sewing machines; if this can be done, I would recommend this before school opens, as the present state of the machines are very poor.\n\nThey also mention an electric Mangle or Ironer this might also be given consideration, however they are on a Lister Bruston engine, and would have to have the type of current that would carry a D.C.\n\nIndian Affairs.

McMillan\"\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nMr. Gooderham: This refers to File 116-4B-2 which you have with you.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6370, file 763-5, part 6)\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise that further to my Night Lettergram of the 23rd inst., I would report as follows on the loss of the Horse and Cattle Barn by fire at the St Cyprians Anglican School.\n\nAt approximately twenty minutes past three o'clock on the afternoon of the 23rd inst., I received a phone call from the Principal of the above school advising me that the barn was on fire; Accompanied by the Clerk I spread the alarm around Brocket; and left with a carload of Indians for the School; When we arrived there around 3.25 P.M., the Barn was a mass of flames and the roof had just fallen in, a large number of Indians had arrived from the threshing crew and surrounding farms, but were only able to help in keeping the other buildings wet so that a spark would not start some other fire. The fire was aggravated by the loft of the barn being full of hay, approximately 80 tons.\n\nAs soon as I arrived I checked with the Principal, on the boys to make sure none were missing, the only children playing in the school yard some distance away were the small tots. On the information of the Farm Instructor Engineer no one had been in the barn since early morning, and the fire was first noticed by him, when he saw a funnel of smoke come out through the cupola on the top of the Hip roofed barn, he rushed to the barn, and opened the door when he was met by a cloud of smoke, following the flames, he was able to save one horse, but four two months old calves perished in the flames. The people who gathered there, helped in the saving of the other out buildings, and also from the sparks causing a prairie fire.\n\nI would gauge the wind blowing at the time to be between 30 and 40 mile an hour wind, and as this kept up all night, I returned to the school at 6 P.M. and waited until 11 P.M. for the fire to get down to a reasonable size, it taking quite a period for the hay to burn down. When I left the embers were still burning, but with very little flame, and the principal had men on guard duty all night. We have one thing to be thankful for and that is that the wind was in the west, with no chance of sparks falling on the school.\n\nI discussed the question of the Milk herd with the Principal, this can be temporary placed in the long Implement shed, until it is possible to replace the barn; In this connection if it is the best's wish to rebuild lumber for completion will be hard to get, however a barn could be put up as a shell completed when finished lumber is available. This however can be taken up after the debris has been cleared up and the state of the Foundation is inspected.\n\nI also discussed the question of Feed with Mr Cole they having lost their whole winters feed, and I offered him a small stack of 1\u00bd? old hay at the C.I. Ranch, which we do not intend to use, I can also if it is the wish of the Branch spare him some from my surplus from last year. I also gathered the Indians together and suggested to them that they put on a bee and put up as much possible before the weather breaks.\n\nThe children were allowed to go home for\nfor twenty-four hours in case of a change of wind causing the sparks to travel over the direction of the school.\n\nThe older boys were kept so that help would be available if needed.\n\nAfter looking over the situation and discussing it with the Principal Mr Cole, and Mr Irwin it would look apparent that the fire was caused by combustion in the loft; I checked with Mr Irwin re the lighting of the barn, but found that during the day the main switch had been pulled, and he was satisfied that there was no possible chance of a short circuit. The children were all in their class rooms, except for a few small boys and girls playing in the grounds close to the school.\n\nI would be glad to have the Branch's instructions as to whether immediate action will be taken to replace this building, or whether a temporary structure will be built to house the milk cows. If such action is thought off, nails are practically not purchasable, and it would be necessary if the Branch can locate any to have them shipped out from the East. At present building in this District is completely stopped through lack of nails.\n\nThis completes my report on the fire which I am very sorry to have to report.\n\nAnthony McCullough\nIndian Agent.\n\nI MacLeod Airport RCAF - milk cows - 2 buildings\n\n2 milk cows important.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nTwo Indian Schools - Sacred Heart and St. Cyprian's -\nPeigan Indian Agency\n\nRe: Weatherstripping - Each School\n\nAs Follows:\n65 Windows - 3 X 6-6\n15 Windows - 3 X 5\n3 Exit Doors\n\nMaterials:\nDennis A.A.

HOEY\n\nFurther to our memorandum of October 24, I am passing for your information copies of the report received from the Indian Agent, concerning the recent fire at the St. Cyprian Anglican School, Brocket, Alberta. We intend to approach the Crown Assets Allocation Committee to ascertain if there are any buildings at the R.C.A.F.

Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nEnc.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise that further to my Night Lettergram of the 23rd instant, I would report as follows on the loss of the Horse and Cattle Barn by fire at the St. Cyprians Anglican School.\n\nAt approximately twenty minutes past three o'clock on the afternoon of the 23rd inst., I received a phone call from the Principal of the above school advising me that the barn was on fire; Accompanied by the Clerk I spread the alarm around Brocket; and left with a carload of Indians for the School where we arrived there around 3:25 p.m. the barn was a mass of flames and the roof had just fallen in, a large number of Indians had arrived from the threshing crew and surrounding farms but were only able to help in keeping the other buildings wet so that a spark would not start some other fire. The fire was aggravated by the loft of the barn being full of hay approximately 30 Ton.\n\nAs soon as I arrived I checked with the Principal, on the boys to make sure none were missing, the only children playing in the school yard some distance away were the small tots. On the information of the Farm Instructor Engineer no one had been in the barn since early morning and the fire was first noticed by him, when he saw a funnel of smoke come out through the window on the top of the Hip roofed barn, he rushed to the barn, and opened the door when he was met by a cloud of smoke, followed by flames, he was able to save one horse, but four two months old calves perished in the flames. The people who gathered there, helped in the saving of the other out buildings, and also from the sparks causing a prairie fire.\n\nI would gauge the wind blowing at the time to be between 30 and 40 mile an hour wind, and as this kept up all night, I returned to the school at 6 p.m. and waited until 11 pm. for the fire to get down to a reasonable size, it taking quite a period for the hay to burn down. When I left the embers were still burning, but with very little flame, and the principal had men on guard duty all night. We have one thing to be thankful for and that is that the wind was in the west, with no chance of sparks falling on the school.\n\nI discussed the question of the Milk herd with the Principal, this can be temporary placed in the long Implement shed, until it is possible to replace the barn; In this connection if it is the dept's wish to rebuild lumber for completion will be hard to get, however a barn could be put up as a shell to be completed when finished lumber is available. This however can be taken up after the debris has been cleared up and the state of the Foundation is inspected.\n\nI also discussed the question of Feed with Mr. Cole they having lost their whole winters feed, and I offered him a small stack of 1942 old hay at the C.Y. Ranch, which we do not intend to use, I can also if it is the wish of the Branch spare him some from my surplus from last year. I also gathered the Indians together and suggested to them that they put on a bee and put up as much possible before the weather breaks.\n\nThe children were allowed to go home for twenty four hours in case of a change of wind causing the sparks to travel over the direction of the school.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6370, file 763-5, part 6)\nThe older boys were kept so that help would be available if needed.\n\nAfter looking over the situation and discussing it with the Principal Mr. Gold, and Mr. Irwin it would look apparent that the fire was caused by combustion in the loft; I checked with Mr. Irwin re the lighting of the barn, but found that during the day the main switch had been pulled, and he was satisfied that there was no possible chance of a short circuit. The children were all in their class rooms, except for a few small boys and girls playing in the grounds close to the school.\n\nI would be glad to have the Branch's instructions as to whether immediate action will be taken to replace this building, or whether a temporary structure will be built to house the Milk cows. If such action is thought off, nails are practically not purchaseable, and it would be necessary if the Branch can locate any to have them shipped out from the East. At present building in this District is completely stopped through lack of nails.\n\nThis completes my report on the fire which I am very sorry to have to report.\n\n(Sgd) Anthony McMillan,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, October 30, 1946.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\n- The Acting Deputy Minister -\n\nI am sending forward herewith for your information copy of a report on the destruction by fire of the barn at the St. Cyprian Anglican School, Peigan Agency, Alberta, received by this branch from Mr. McMillan.\n\nDirector,\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is not practical to use rib material with AA parting stop as the parting stop allows for expansion and contraction of sash due to weather conditions. Rib material can only be used where all members are rigidly held together, bronze is the more flexible and is ideal and advocated by the manufacturers of AA strip.\n\n2nd: Have made any extra work on an hourly rate of $1.25 which is fair.\n\nIf these changes are acceptable we shall commence work immediately upon arrival of the necessary materials.\n\nAs there are only two sizes of windows, we would appreciate it if the widths and heights of openings were taken by someone at the school and forwarded immediately. The measurement to be taken between jambs and from head jamb to sill. Measurement of one window of each size is sufficient.\n\nIt would be advisable if the pulley ropes were examined for breakage and frayed ropes and that replacement rope of the correct diameter be available. Also, any broken lights that require replacement should be counted and the sizes required should also be made available along with putty.\n\nAs soon as these sizes reach me will order the necessary materials.\n\nThere is no possibility of commencing work before January.

We have recently received a typical report from the Southern Alberta Electric Limited concerning conditions at two Indian residential schools in Pelican Agency. The principal reported to the Agent that twice recently there had been instances of bulbs blowing out and sockets and electric wiring burning. Fortunately, in both instances there happened to be a member of the staff in the room when this had happened. Therefore, Mr. Indian Agent McMillan, in view of the evident fire hazard, called in the above company for an emergency inspection. I attach a copy of the above company's reports on both these schools.\n\nWould it be possible to have an article prepared for a future issue of our magazine entitled \"The Care and Maintenance of the Electrical Plants in Residential Schools\" so that we may draw to the attention of all concerned the absolute necessity of careful maintenance and common sense in the use of the electrical plants provided.\nMemorandum to Surveys & Engineering. Feb. 3, 1947.\n\nIn the instance of these two schools we have requested Mr. Indian Agent McMillan to obtain estimates immediately upon the emergency repairs that will have to be carried out. It is felt that one of your engineers from Banff might visit these two schools in the near future to further report upon this situation.\n\nDirector.\nc/c to Inspector Gooderham\n\nOttawa, February 8th, 1947.\n\nMr. A.

Fraser,\nLands & Buildings Dept.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Building #41 - Service Car Garage -\nMacLeod Aerodrome, Alberta.\n\nWe have already had correspondence with Mr. C.A. Patterson, War Assets Corporation, No. 4 Temporary Building, Ottawa, with reference to securing this building.\n\nWe were under the impression that there would be no charge for it. It is our intention to use the building for a barn at one of our residential schools which recently lost their barn by fire.\n\nIt is noted from your letter that the building will cost us $367.60 and we are communicating with the Inspector of Indian Agencies for Alberta with a view to ascertaining if he considers the building is worth this amount for our purposes. As soon as his reply is received, we will advise you.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, March 27th, 1947.\n\nMr. G.H. Gooderham, Inspector of Indian Agencies, Calgary, Alberta.\n\nWith reference to my letter of January 24th and previous correspondence regarding the building at the R.C.A.F. Station, MacLeod, Alberta, which might be used as a barn at the St. Cyprian's Residential School, I enclose for your information copy of a letter which we have just received from War Assets Corporation.\n\nYou will note that they expect us to pay $367.60 for the building. In addition, there would be the cost of moving it to the school site. Do you recommend purchase of the building under these circumstances just mentioned?\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, March 29th, 1947.\n\nMr. Anthony McMillan, Indian Agent,\nBRACKET, Alberta.\n\nWith reference to your voucher of the\n27th ultimo, which is returned, please issue\ntwo vouchers; one for the work done at the St.\nCyprian School and the other for the Sacred\nHeart School.\n\nWe would also appreciate it if the ex-\nplanations given in your letter of March 12th\nwould be included on each voucher as it applies\nto that school. It is simply impossible for\nus to keep our filing system unless we receive\nseparate accounts and separate explanations.\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\nPINCHER CREEK\nALBERTA\n\nIN ACCOUNT WITH\n\nS.

The barn is badly needed, and if it can be built this year it should be done, as the temporary accommodation will not suffice the next winter.\n\nThe question of the state of the cement floor if Iron cow stalls are going to be put in, would have to checked by a man qualified to do so, as this cement took an awful licking from the heat, when the fire was at its worst.\n\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Barn, St. Cyprian's Residential School, Keigan Reserve\nreferring to your letter of May 22nd,\nfile 116-1-5 (WT 1).\n\nIt was a surprise to know that no provision\nwas made in the current year's appropriation to erect a\nbarn for this school. A barn is needed, and attached\nhereto is copy of a letter and sketch prepared by the\nIndian agent. The sketch merely indicates the space\nthat would be required; it does not indicate the type\nof barn that might be constructed.\n\nIt is our considered opinion that the\nbarn should not have a loft, but that hay and roughage\nmight be stored in stacks, or in a shed adjoining the\nbarn. The construction would be simple and not so\ncostly.\n\nAs you will, no doubt, have many plans\nof barns, no attempt will be made to submit an idea of\nwhat the construction would be.\n\nAs for cost, it would be a wild guess\nto say that it should not cost over $5,000.00 fully\nequipped.\n\nAt your convenience, please advise what\nmay be expected.\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\n| DATE   | INVOICE | DEBITS | CREDITS | BALANCE |\n|--------|---------|--------|---------|---------|\n| May 22 | A 9333  |        |         |         |\n| 2      | Softball Bats | $1.40 Each | $8.40   |         |\n| 6      | Softballs    | $1.80 Each | $10.80  |         |\n| 1      | Basket Ball  | $14.40   |         |         |\n| 2      | Volley Balls | $6.50 Each | $13.00  |         |\n| 2      | Volley Ball Nets | $8.80 Each | $17.60  |         |\n|        | G.P.X.Ppd.Voucher | $2.61     |         | $66.81  |\n\n\"To Mrs. E.S.W.

(RG 10, Volume 6370, file 763-5, part 6)\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise that this week I visited the St Cyprians Residential School with a view to checking over with Principal the necessary repairs to the above School.\n\nAs this will incur a very large expenditure I will be glad to receive your advice as to what can be done under the Estimates, and also if any further sum will be spent on the larger requests.\n\nSome of the items are what would be classed Emergency repairs, while others come under the Estimates asked for every year.\n\nThe following are the items quoted by the Principal:\n\n1. Chimney\n   The large chimney arising about 40 feet above the annex, was examined and it was found that numerous bricks are loosening up around the base, with some of them right out. Inspection of this chimney, especially the base should be made by someone who knows, and the necessary repairs made.\n\n2. Painting\n   I have been advised by the Principal that during last year he used with labor from the staff approximately 25 gallons of paint for inside decoration, this pain being the property of the School, the Principal would like the value of the paint placed to the outside painting of the School Building. As quoted under the letter of the Sacred Heart School which is the same size, it would mean the purchase of at least 50 Gallons Linseed Oil and 250 Cans White Lead 25 Lbs. There is no question that the schools should be repainted with window trim on the windows.\n\n3. Dormitory\n   The laying of the floor in the boys dormitory is badly needed and the cost will approximate $400.00. This floor is badly rutted with the cuts made by the castors on the beds, and in some places the floor is worn right through. This is the boys dormitory the boys dormitory having been done.\n\n4. Linoleum\n   Battle ship linoleum is asked for the floors of the following room with the yardage shown alongside of the room, Boys Play Room 55 Yards, Girls Playroom 50 Yds Hall 25 Yards, Hall No 2, 40 yards, Dining Room 50 Yds a total of 260 sq yards.\n\n5. Lockers\n   The lockers in the boys dormitory are completely gone and will have to be replaced, this would mean two sides of the room with boot lockers, with cover for the seats.\n\nItems in last years Estimates according to available funds.\n\nThe Crash Panels in the Above school is now being done by the Principals Father in Law at an very small cost, and will be vouchered for when completed this School both the school and outbuildings are badly in need of a coat of paint.\ncoat of paint, and I would like to have your opinion as to whether sufficient funds will be available to do work of this kind as it will be necessary in next year's estimates to include all the items brought forward in this letter.\n\nI might state that today I have been advised of a change of Principals at this school, but I do not think that this will change the programme.\n\nI will be glad to receive your authority of the amount allowed, and also whether other items will be taken care of, when I will get all the necessary figures prepared.\n\nAnthony M.

Mr. Freeze stated that it would require expert tradesmen to do all the work, except that of recapping the kitchen chimney, which can be done by any handy man. The roofing repairs should be done by people who specialize in doing roofing. It is not known here whether you can find any qualified person or concern closer than Lethbridge. Please locate the nearest and get an estimate of the cost of the work, then submit same direct to Ottawa, as the Supt. of Welfare & Training has been advised.

However, at the point where the chimney emerges from the roof the boiler house attention should be given to the brickwork. First of all proper flashing and counter flashing should be installed, as shown on the accompanying drawing, marked detail \"A\". When the flashing and counter flashing has been installed the brickwork should be pointed out with cement, mortar or asphalt gum. This is properly a tinsmith and roofer's job and I would strongly urge that you have a qualified man do the work.\n\n(2) Regarding the kitchen chimney I would recommend that the loose bricks at the top be removed and that it be recapped with a concrete cap, in the manner shown in detail \"B\" attached.\n\n(3) Regarding the roof the main building I would suggest that\n\n(a) New down pipe be installed from the three hoppers to the main waste, i.e., the horizontal pipes be renewed complete with roof receivers of an approved type, the minimum construction being as shown on detail \"C\" attached. In order to install these receivers it will be necessary to remove the roofing for a distance of about 4 feet all round each receive and to replace it at the time the receiver is being installed. This work should also be done by an approved roofer.\n\n(b) Around the flashings and parapets the roof has perished and the following treatment is necessary.\n\nScrape off the gravel back from the flashings for a distance of about 15 inches. Install two ply of 15\npound roofing felt, carried up underneath the galvanized iron flashing and out onto the roof, the felt to be solidly mopped to the existing roofing and solidly mopped between the piles. After the felt is in place regravel up to the flashing. This work should be done by an approved roofer.\n\n(4) I would recommend that the various actions mentioned above be carried out at the earliest possible date, and certainly during this summer. I feel that these are emergency repairs and that the public interest will suffer if the work is not put in hand.\n\nI trust that this report will be of value to you. If there is anything else that I can do, do not hesitate to call on me.\n\n(sgd.) D. A Freeze,\nDistrict Resident Architect.\n\nDAF/H\nEnc.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nAttention: Supt. of Welfare & Training\n\nThe principal of the Anglican School, Brocket, recently reported that the roof was leaking and that he was worried about the chimneys. I conferred with the Public Works Engineer of the province, Mr. Freeze, who kindly offered to inspect the building.\n\nAttached hereto is copy of his report and copy of a letter which was directed today to the Indian Agent at Brocket.

(RG 10, Volume 6370, file 763-5, part 6)\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise that I have spent considerable time with the Principal of the Anglican School re the work to be done on the estimates, allowed him for this year $600.00.\n\nIt would seem that with the shortage of labor that nothing concrete can be arranged, and he has got his Father in Law to do considerable small jobs in the School, such as the Crash Doors, Lockers, cupboards, etc., this work has been done in a workman like manner, and is a very good job.\n\nAs this will mean considerable Vouchers and labor sheets, the following suggestion is made when we discussed the matter, and that is that the following request be made which if allowed would take care of the Estimates, and at the same time refund the monies paid out, if this suggestion is carried out, then all the items of small repairs would be paid by the School from the proceeds of their Farm.\n\nThe two main items are as follows:\n\nRefrigerator. This was purchased and paid for by the School last year, and is now giving good service to the School. It was purchased at the cost of $456.00, and the receipt is available attached to the Voucher if authorized. To my mind if this is allowable, it would save considerable work, and the question of sorting out the little repair jobs would be done away with. If this is allowed may I be advised so that I may obtain the account and receipt.\n\nBattleship Linoleum. The other request is for Battleship Linoleum, for the Boys and Girls play room and down stair toilets. This will be approximately 200 Lineal Feet, and should cost around $240.00.\n\nThis would leave a little over $100.00 for emergencies and could be left for that purpose.\n\nThe following are the small jobs done by Mr. Chamberlain Locker in Boys Playroom, Cupboards in Boys Playroom, Repairing Lockers in Girls Playroom, making cupboards in Girls playroom. Repairing Bread Mixer. Construction of Cupboard in Pantry. All this work has been done efficiently, and lumber or siding has been used of an old house at the school.\n\nIf the above suggestions are satisfactory I will be glad to receive the authority.\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nI have your letter of 25th September on the above subject and would advise that during the past week action has been taken to procure prices on materials for construction of this building.\n\nWhen the matter was considered early in 1945, it was proposed to erect a 1\u00bd storey building 75' x 45' with full-sized basement partly above grade - the allocation of space to be\n\n(a) Basement Kitchen, Dining Room, Staff Dining Room, Play Room, Furnace Room, Stores and Fuel.\n\n(b) Main Floor Boys Dormitory, Girls Dormitory, Staff Living Room, Infirmary, Offices, Lavatories, etc.\n\n(c) Attic or Upper Half Storey General Storage\n\nThe type of construction contemplated was solid masonry walls of local field stone for the basement, which would have a concrete floor. The walls of the main portion of the building were to be of logs obtained in the vicinity. The balance of the material required was to be finished lumber, doors, windows, cement gyproc, roofing, etc., shipped in from Edmonton.\n\nEarly in 1945, a bill of materials for a building as described above and an estimate of cost of the items not available locally at Wabasca were prepared for us by the W. H. Clark Lumber Co. Ltd. of Edmonton. However, in view of the general increase in prices since that time, we wrote them on 25th Sept. asking them to favour us with a revised estimate and\nalso with an estimate of freight charges on this material from Edmonton to Slave Lake.\n\nAlso on 25th September we wrote (via air mail) the Principal at Wabasca asking if he could get a price locally for the supply of the necessary logs and their delivery to the site by the middle of March next. At the same time we asked him to report the approximate cost of procuring locally next spring the estimated 20 cords of field stone, 60 cubic yards of gravel and 30 cubic yards of sand required for the basement floor and walls.\n\nAs soon as replies are received to the inquiries indicated above, we should like to discuss the project with you in detail. We appreciate fully the need for early action in order to take advantage of the appropriation in your Departmental Estimates for the current fiscal year.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nG. R. Turner\nfor Superintendent\n\nGRT/BP\nMr. P. N. Phelan,\nChief Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Mission House, Brocket, Alta.\n\nAs arranged by telephone on September 26th, I am sending you herewith a copy of a letter dated September 20th, 1947 from Mr. E.S.W. Cole, Principal of our school at Brocket. This is in reply to a letter written by my predecessor on September 12th, 1947 in which Mr. Cole was told that this office was taking up with you the question as to whether or not the plan authorized by your Branch in May, 1946 for moving and placing the house in first class order could now be proceeded with.\n\nApparently the estimated cost in May, 1946 was only $1,250.00 compared to Mr. Cole's present estimated cost of $3,000.00.\n\nWill you please advise me whether you will be able to take any action towards reconditioning this building during the current financial year. We would like to see something done if it is at all possible.\n\nWe wired a week ago about an estimate for the barn at Brocket, and have hastened the Principal by wire again today.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nG.

Actually, it is much the better plan to put this house into shape but it will take a much greater sum of money than was first estimated of $1,250. The house has been used to store grain, tractor fuel and turkeys. Unfortunately we had no alternative following the loss of the barn. The main timbers supporting the floor has given-way and due to the fact of our excavated basement caving in this has been filled.\n\nIn my opinion, about $3,000. will be required now to make the house habitable.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd.)

Hereunder is the report from St. Cyprian's, Brocket, showing the Principal's classification as to urgency:\n\nVERY URGENT\n\nRe-flooring of boys dormitory 40' x 30'\n\nThe present flooring is patched with rough boards in places and is giving way in others.\nEstimated cost, including labour - $500.00\n\nURGENT\n\n(a) Re-painting exterior of School\n\nThe siding is now in a reasonable condition and painting as a preservative will prove economical in the long run.\nEstimated cost (obtained some years ago and obviously higher now) $900.00\n\n(b) New Root-House\n\nThe present root-house was built 15 years ago. It was not well constructed at that time and now is unsafe besides being too small. A new structure 30' x 20' x 5' depth is suggested at an estimated cost of $450.00\nDESIRABLE\n\nNew Chicken House\n35' x 18' x 7' high with flat or pitched roof\nNo estimate of cost.\n\nThe Principal advises that your local Agent, Mr. A. McMillan, is familiar with the above requirements.\n\nMay these services be given consideration when you prepare your Departmental estimates for 1948-49, please.\n\nYours truly,\n\nG. R. Turner\nfor Superintendent\nOttawa, October 10, 1947.\n\nDear General Turner:\n\nWe have your letter of the 4th instant with reference to requirements at the St. Cyprian Indian Residential School.\n\nThe expenditures which you recommend will receive careful consideration when we are preparing our appropriation for the fiscal year 1948-49.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMajor General G. R. Turner,\nIndian School Administration, M.S.C.C.,\n102 Bank Street,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOctober 4th, 1947\n\nMajor Gen. G. R. Turner\n\nMr. F. N. Phelan,\nChief Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Furniture, St. Cyprian's School,\nBrocket, Alberta.\n\nThe Principal of the above school reports that the staff sitting room is badly in need of furniture and he has requested that one complete chesterfield suite be supplied at a cost of approximately $200.00. He suggests that it be purchased from either Eaton's or the Hudson's Bay Company where a 10% discount could be obtained.\n\nAs this is a Government-owned school for which I understand, you are prepared to procure essential furniture, will you please advise me whether or not you can purchase this furniture from your appropriations for the current year. If you can do so, the Principal will be asked for catalogue number, or particulars, so that the articles secured by your Purchasing Agent may be of the type, colour, etc. to satisfy the Principal.\n\nYours truly,\n\nG. R. Turner\nfor Superintendent\nOttawa, October 10, 1947.\n\nDear General Turner:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 4th instant regarding additional furniture for the St. Cyprian's Indian Residential School, the Principal should request the Indian Agent to forward a requisition for a Chesterfield suite. He should state definitely the type of suite required and quote a catalogue number from either Eaton's or the Hudson's Bay Company. We note from your letter that the set can probably be obtained for less than $200.00.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nPP/HM.\n\nMajor General G.R.

I believe fuel saved in one year would more than pay for household size stoves. During the long summer months we must perform our the coal in our stove to cook for four or five staff members. Many afternoons during school sessions one stove would suffice. We must use on an average 200 lbs. of coal in one day in one kitchen range. The installation of two smaller kitchen stoves would at least fulfill one recommendation suggested by Miss McCreedy, the Dietitian, and this is, provision of more working space.\"\n\nCan you do anything from this year's funds to provide the two new stoves recommended and, if so, do you want us to give you details for your Purchasing Agent, or will you get your Agent to submit them to you?\n\nYours truly,\n\nG.

Clock.\n\nYesterday the Principal of St Cyprians School came to the Office re the Night Watchmans clock, which is out of order and re which he had been in correspondence with the Chicago Watch Clock Division, re having a replacement while getting their clock repaired.\n\nI find that the Customs at Lethbridge will not release the replacement until Duty of $11.80 is paid, and as this clock to my belief is the Property of the Indian Affairs Branch I feel before I take this clock out I should get your advice as to whether we are dutiable, or whether the Branch knos of a place in Canada where this clock can be repaired, before I accept the customs notice.\n\nMay I have a reply by return.\n\nAccording to the information on the clock this should have been sent away for cleaning in 1947.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSuperintendent.\nAIR MAIL\n\nDecember 8th, 1949.\n\nMr. A. McMillan,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nBrocket, Alberta.\n\nRe: St. Cyprian's Indian Residential School. Your File 116-13-1\n\nWith reference to the repairs to the night watchman's clock at the above school, it is regretted that your letter is not clear to us.\n\nIt might be inferred from the first part of the second paragraph of your letter that the clock had already been sent to the United States for repairs, and on its return the clock was being held at the Customs Office at Lethbridge for payment of duty in the amount of $11.80.\n\nIn the latter portion of the second paragraph, you ask if there is any place in Canada where the clock can be repaired. Please clarify the matter for us.\n\nCan the Principal state the approximate date on which this clock was obtained by this school. We require this information before we can make a review of our file to ascertain if it was purchased by the Department or by the school management.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nPP/ST Chief, Education Division\n**PURCHASE ORDER**\n\nTO LaFrance Fire Engine & Fosmire Ltd.,  \n195 Weston Road,  \nToronto 9, Ont.\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING MATERIALS AND CHARGE TO THE DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES.\n\nSHIP TO A.

When the replacement arrived he was advised by Customs at Lethbridge that the duty on the clock being sent for replacement was $11.80.\n\nHe then came to me, and brought the clock for repair with him and that is when I wrote you, regarding the Duty on the clock for temporary replacement, which will be returned to Chicago when the original clock has been repaired and returned.\n\nThe remark in the latter portion of the second paragraph re whether the clock could be repaired in Canada was so if that was possible the replacement would be sent back.\n\nThe ownership of this clock is Department, and Vouchers 86 and 87 for $38.59, and $15.20 respectively sent forward on September 25th 1946 were paid by the Department. There has been three changes of Principals since then, and they would not know at present where the clock came from.\n\nMay I have authority to pay the Duty, and also have the clock repaired, so that we will have the clock in shape to have the Night Watchman punch it according to the rules governing the Night Watchman's duties.\n\nSuperintendent.\n\nIndian Affairs.

McMillan on January 24th, 1950.\n\nWhen we received the account the following questions were asked of the Principal and the following answers received.\n\nQuestion (a) When you \"inquired in mid December about having your road opened and the snow blade was sent\" was it attached to an Indian Affairs Tractor or Sacred Heart Tractor or a hired tractor?\n\nAnswer (a) The snow blade was attached to the Sacred Heart Tractor.\n\nQuestion (b) About what date was the bull-dozer used for which the account of $50.00 has been submitted?\n\nAnswer (b) Date of Thursday January 19th, 1950 (Evening).\n\nQuestion (c) Have you ever asked McMillan to let you have the snow plow blade for use with your own tractor and, if so, what was his reply?\n\nAnswer (c) No. Soon after the middle of December the snow was too deep to clear with a light tractor.\n\nThe following information is also pertinent.\n\nWhen Principal Woods enquired about use of the snow blade (mid-December) it was sent to a point \u00bd mile from the school and has never been used by St. Cyprian's.\n\nThe Principal did not ask that the road be opened at the time for which the bill of $50 is submitted. He claimed that there was no thaw forecast and that the road was completely blocked again within three days of its being cleared.\n\n(P.T.O.)\n\nIndian Affairs.

The condition of the Dominion Government owned section has become such that something must be done about it, as it is adversely affecting the service on our portion serving Brocket, which is properly maintained. It would not matter so much if trouble on your section only affected that portion of the line, but when it reflects back on our own line and subscribers service, then you will appreciate it becomes serious.\n\nWe therefore have no alternative than to respectfully notify you that if we do not hear within 60 days, advising that this matter is going to be taken care of by the Dominion Government instructions will be issued to disconnect your portion of the line from ours at Brocket.\n\nWe are prepared to build the line at a cost already quoted, but would much prefer that the Dominion Government do it themselves, as we actually have more work than we can handle, of our own, without doing custom work.\n\nTrust that you will be able to make the necessary arrangements so that we will not be obliged to interrupt your telephone service.\n\nYours very truly\n\nThos Spalding\nGeneral Commercial Superintendent.\nIndian Affairs Branch  \nDept of Citizenship & Immigration  \nOttawa.\n\nAfter advising the Alberta Government Telephones, that we had not the funds available to pay for the replacement of the line mentioned in their letter, I have received the following letter, a copy of which I am forwarding to you for your answer to their threat.\n\nI might state that they quote the line to the Indian Agency, this is not the line in question, the line to this Agency being the same as the rest of Brocket, the line which needs replacing, is the line running to the Residential Schools, which goes East of the Indian Agency to the Sacred Heart School, with a cut off going south to the St Cyprians School.\n\nAnthony D. Sullivan  \nSuperintendent.\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept of Citizenship & Immigration,\nOttawa.\n\nFurther to my letter of the 14th February with enclosure, and my Night lettergram of todays date, I received a call from the Alberta Government Telephones Lethbridge enquiring as to what action we are going to take in connection with the line to the Residential Schools, as the time they gave us for doing something was almost up, and they had not received any word.\n\nI told them I had forwarded to my Branch a copy of the letter from the Head Office, and thought that this would be handled direct from Ottawa with Edmonton, however he advised me that Edmonton had not received any reply from you. As the cutting off of the School lines will entail them considerable inconvenience, may I be instructed whether you will write Edmonton direct, or advise what answer you wish me to give to the Telephone Co, as to what is going to be done.\n\nAnthony McMillan\nSuperintendent.\nBROCKET ALTA 12\n\nINDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nBRANCH DEPT OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION OTTAWA ONT\n\nRE MY LETTER FILE ONE ONE SIX BAR EIGHT BAR TWELVE OF FEB FOURTEENTH\n\nI HAVE RECEIVED A TELEPHONE CALL FROM LETHBRIDGE ASKING FOR A DECISION ON THE LINE IN QUESTION AS THEY INTEND TO SHUT OFF BOTH SCHOOLS SHORTLY MAY I HAVE YOUR INSTRUCTIONS OR THE BRANCH ADVISE ALBERTA GOVERNMENT TELEPHONES THEIR ANSWER DIRECT BY RETURN\n\nA MCMILLAN\n\nIndian Affairs.

The company claim that the condition of this section of the telephone line has become such that something must be done about it immediately. The company further state that it would not matter so much if the trouble on our section of the line only affected that particular portion, but the trouble reflects back on the line of the Alberta Government Telephones and their subscribers are complaining.\n\nWe have not yet secured a firm price on replacing the line, but it has been estimated by the Alberta Government Telephones that the approximate cost of rebuilding this pole line is $4,364.00.\n\nThe attendance at both the schools mentioned is approximately 113, and for medical and other reasons, it is most desirable that they have telephone service. It is our intention to include in the Supplementary Estimates an amount to cover the cost of replacing the present telephone line.\n\nDirector.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept of Citizenship & Immigration,\nOttawa.\n\nFincher Creek - Brocket X Line.\n\nReference my Telegram April 12th and my letter of the same date, File 116/3-12, I have received from the Head Office in Edmonton the following letter by Registered mail.\n\n\"Further to our letter of February 9th, we are very sorry indeed that no attention has been given to our request that this line be put in proper working condition. This is now to advise that unless satisfactory arrangements are completed by May 15th, that our Commercial Superintendent at Lethbridge is being requested, by a copy of this letter, to issue an Order to disconnect this line from our network on that date, and this instruction will definitely be carried out and on that date.\"\n\nSgd Thos Spalding,\nGeneral Commercial Supt.\n\nMay I be advised if this matter has been taken up through our head office.\n\nAnthony McMillan\nSuperintendent.\nB. F. Neary, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Citizenship and Immigration,\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe: Telephone Lines - Sacred Heart & St. Cyprian's Residential School, Pelican Agency.\n\nThis office received a copy of Superintendent McKillan's letter to you of February 14th dealing with a telephone line that connects the system at Brocket with the two residential schools on the Pelican Reserve. Although we have no further correspondence on file, I took the matter up with Superintendent McKillan on my recent visit to his Agency and he showed me your wire of April 19th in which you stated that you were submitting his letter to the Minister, as no funds had been specifically provided in the 1950/51 appropriation to rebuild the telephone lines.\n\nWe have just concluded a search of Commissioner Graham's file and we have found that these two lines were erected in 1927 and 1928. Correspondence indicates that the Department's share in the cost at that time was $300.00 per school. This apparently provided all the materials needed to complete the installation and approximately $185.00 left over from the Department's contribution was used to pay at least part of the cost of labour required to install the service. It is assumed that the schools themselves took care of any additional costs involved, if there were any. Our files make no mention of this except that the total of $600.00 was to have been the only contribution made by the Department towards the cost of installation.\n\nMr. McKillan informed me that if the Alberta Government Telephones reconstruct these lines for us, the cost would exceed $4,000.00. I considered this excessive, therefore, I interviewed Mr. J. Boorman, the local manager of the Alberta Government Telephones at Macleod in which I found that at the outset the poles would have to be replaced over a distance of 8 miles, requiring from 30 to 32 poles per mile with minimum height each of 20 feet. Not only would these poles be expensive but they are a type which only the Alberta Government Telephones can supply. In addition to this the wire would have to be checked and if not replaced, certainly splices would have to be made in many places. Also involved is the installation of insulation and side blocks requiring expensive materials and the services of qualified servicemen. I conclude that even if we could obtain all necessary materials, it would be doubtful if we could effect any appreciable saving over the price quoted by Alberta Government Telephones.\nI do not think there is any point in endeavouring to establish whether or not telephone service to these schools is required. The service was considered necessary in 1927 and can be considered just as much a necessity today. Since the poor condition of these telephone lines is causing a serious disruption of service in the whole system in the Brocket area, Alberta Government Telephones want an early reply. If we decide to not place the lines in good condition, they will disconnect this portion of the system.\n\nThis letter is written for information only.\n\nG. H.

It is hoped that the item will\nbe allowed, and if so, the construction of the new line\ncan be started.\n\nThe price quoted by Mr. McMillan was $4,364.00.\nWe considered this high, but in view of the information\ncontained in the third paragraph of your letter, it appears\nthat it will not be possible to secure a much lower price.\n\nFunds will not be available for a few weeks,\nand in the meantime, you might obtain a definite quotation\nfrom the Alberta Government Telephones.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\nCol. B. F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Citizenship and Immigration,\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe: St. Cyprian's Residential School, Peigan Indian Reserve\n\nDuring an inspection of this school on the 20th, the Principal stated that it was nearly impossible to keep the west end of the building warm during the winter months. Considerable has been done during the past three years to make this building more weather-proof; all windows were reather-stripped in 1948, and in 1949 it was covered with insul-brick. There is some additional work to be done on the insul-brick as the contractor had not fully finished this job when the weather became very cold.\n\nThe winds from the west and south-west are terrible in this District, and the day I visited, it could be felt on the inside of the west wall at many points. The Reverend Mr. Woods stated that during the winter it was actually freezing inside the west wall when the east wall of the building was too hot. Would it not be good business to have an engineer inspect the heating plant and make the necessary corrections? There are no Indian Affairs field officials capable of making this inspection, and there certainly is no one on the school staff.\n\nThe girls' basement washroom is at the west end of this building and I marvel that all the pipes had not burst for the plaster walls are broken and there is nothing to prevent the wind and cold getting in. Much the same condition is evident in the pupils' dining-room. These walls must be repaired, and I don't recommend that they be plastered again. Some good hard composition board, with insulation behind it, should replace this plaster. If money is available, kindly advise and Superintendent MacMillan will obtain tenders.\n\nThis institution needs an electric ironer (mangle). The laundry is small and the pupils who should be in class spend hours with the flat irons.\n\nThere are 57 children on the roll, and I was satisfied that Mr. Woods and his staff are trying to run a reasonably good school. This cannot be expected unless the building is properly equipped and in good physical condition. It was noted that some pupils were working in the kitchen and the laundry, when they should be in school, and no doubt they could be in class if there was more modern equipment.\n\nThis residential school, like many others, must carry on for years, unless the Day school programme is speeded up. I, therefore hope that serious consideration can be given to the requests.\n\nG.H. Gooderham,\nGHG/o\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies.\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is noted that you state there is some additional work to be done on the insul-brick as the contractor had not fully finished the job when the weather turned very cold.\n\nIn this connection, I would point out that we received from Superintendent McMillan, a letter dated October 15th, 1949, reading as follows:\n\n\"I am in receipt of your letter of the 5th instant re the insul bricking on the two residential schools of this Agency. I wish to report that the St. Cyprian's school has now been completed, and the contractor is preparing to do the Sacred Heart school as soon as he has completed the hospital building which should be the beginning of next week. The work done on the St. Cyprian school shows up very well, and should make the building warmer.\"\n\nOn the strength of this communication we paid the contractor in full, according to the terms of his tender for insul bricking the St. Cyprian School.\n\nWe were subsequently informed that he did not complete the insul bricking of the Sacred Heart School, and\nconsequently, we withheld part of the payment due him until\nthe work was completed. It would appear from the Superintendent's\nletter that any additional work in connection with the insul\nbricking of the St. Cyprian school should be done by the\ncontractor without cost to the Department.\n\nWith regard to the request for an electric\nironer, please let us know the size of ironer required,\nand to facilitate the purchase you should quote a catalogue\nnumber.\n\nWe are requesting the Department of Resources\nand Development to make an inspection of the building in\norder to ascertain what repairs can be made to remedy the\ncondition mentioned in the second and third paragraphs of\nyour letter.\n\nPP/ST\n\nBernard F.

Gibson, Esq.,\nDirector,\nDevelopment Services Branch,\nDepartment of Resources and Development,\nNorlite Building, Ottawa.\n\nDear Mr. Gibson:\n\nRe: St. Cyprian Indian Residential School, Peigan Indian Agency, Province of Alberta.\n\nIn 1949 insul brick was placed on the outside of this building, and all windows were weather stripped in 1948. In a letter dated April 25th, Regional Supervisor Gooderham reports as follows:\n\n\"The winds from the west and south-west are terrible in this district, and the day I visited it could be felt on the inside of the west wall at many points. The Reverend Mr. Woods stated that during the winter it was actually freezing inside the west wall when the east wall of the building was too hot. Would it not be good business to have an engineer inspect the heating plant and make the necessary corrections? There are no Indian Affairs field officials capable of making this inspection, and there certainly is no one on the school staff.\n\nThe girls' basement washroom is at the west end of this building and I marvel that all the pipes had not burst for the plaster walls are broken and there is nothing to prevent the wind and cold getting in. Much the same condition is evident in the pupils' dining room. These walls must be repaired, and I don't recommend that they be plastered again. Some good hard composition board, with insulation behind it, should replace this plaster. If money is available, kindly advise and Superintendent McMillan will obtain tenders.\"\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6370, file 763-5, part 7)\nIn the current year's appropriation we have provided an amount of $2,500.00 for any repairs that may be necessary.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would have one of your officials visit this school as soon as possible, and advise what action can be taken to remedy the condition mentioned by Mr. Gooderham.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nDirector.\nOttawa, May 9th, 1950.\n\nMr. A.

It would not make any difference to us what condition the Dominion Government's portion of this line was in except that it is an extension of our line and troubles on your section reflect on ours with resulting deterioration in the service to our subscribers, which is something you will appreciate we cannot give them any excuse for when the remedy is in our own hands.\n\nThe condition of this line was drawn to the attention of your agent at Brocket in October last year, at which time we advised him that the cost of rebuilding would be $4564. Finally, in January of this year we received a very curt communication from him of three lines advising that there were no funds available for the work, no suggestion was made to the effect that the matter was being given further consideration or anything of that kind, simply no funds and that was that. We of course, after receipt of this letter had no alternative than to take a serious view of the matter as our subscribers' service was definitely being adversely affected by the condition of this line.\n\nIn the event that finally authority is received to rebuild the line we would prefer that you arrange to do it yourselves as we are not particularly anxious to undertake any custom work, as our hands are more than full trying to take care of telephone needs today. However, if you cannot arrange to have it done by others than us we will do our best to help you out. We will delay any further action in this matter for 60 days to give you an opportunity to go into the matter further, except that at any time your section develops trouble that seriously interferes with our subscribers we reserve the right to immediately and without any hesitation disconnect your portion.\n\nWe trust that this will meet your requirements at least for the time being.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThos.

He is being instructed to endeavour to obtain a quotation from some other source, although frankly I must say that this might be impossible. As an alternative, he should try to get a quotation on the poles and arrive at the cost of digging the holes and setting these poles in place. If this portion of the work is done we may be able to persuade the Alberta Government Telephones to carry out the technical part of the job.\n\nIn the meantime it is hoped that the item in the Supplementary Estimates will be allowed.\n\nG.

I considered this necessary as the manager of the district of which this pole line forms a part, reported that no poles were fit for further use.\n\nIn company with Mr. Cameron, Mr. McMillan saw the manager at Macleod, who in turn directed him to his superior at Lethbridge, who also refused to make a decision and referred him to Mr. Thos. Spalding, General Commercial Superintendent at Edmonton. Mr. McMillan wrote to Mr. Spalding and his reply has not yet been received.\n\nI considered this procedure necessary so that there will be no avenue left open for the telephone company to refuse service at some future date. I don't know what the reply will be from Mr. Spalding but by using the old poles a saving of $1,150.00 is effected and should be considered.\n\nIn the final analysis, will not the decision rest with our Branch, if we are assured that the poles are sound and then properly creosoted and set, would we not be justified in accepting Mr. Cameron's lower tender?\n\nYou should receive this letter as early as a wire can reach you after hearing from Mr. Spalding and then be in a position to make a decision and wire instructions.\n\nG.

The company claim that the condition of this section of the telephone line has become such that something must be done about it immediately. The company further state that it would not matter so much if the trouble on our section of the line only affected that particular portion, but the trouble reflects back on the line of the Alberta Government Telephones and their subscribers are complaining.\n\nWe have not yet secured a firm price on replacing the line, but it has been estimated by the Alberta Government Telephones that the approximate cost of rebuilding this pole line is $4,564.00.\n\nThe attendance at both the schools mentioned is approximately 113, and for medical and other reasons, it is most desirable that they have telephone service. It is our intention to include in the Supplementary Estimates an amount to cover the cost of replacing the present telephone line.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, June 14th, 1950.\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nRe: St. Cyprian Indian Residential School\nSacred Heart Indian Residential School\nPeigan Indian Agency, Province of Alberta, Electoral District of Macleod.\n\nI desire to refer you to my memorandum of April 20th, 1950, which is attached.

Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Citizenship & Immigration,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nRe: Anglican Indian Residential School\nBrocket, Alberta.\n\nIn a letter written July first Principal Woods reports that after a hailstorm on that date the melting hailstones on the roof of the school created quite a flood in the building. This flooding after snow or rain is no new experience at St. Cyprian's and has been reported to the Agency Superintendent a number of times. Requisitions for roofing and pipes have been placed also but apparently they get no farther than the superintendent's office desk.\n\nDr. Stone was on visit to the school at the time of the hailstorm and I understand from the Principal that he (Dr. Stone) is submitting a report on his observations to the Regional Supervisor of Agencies, Calgary. What Mr. Gooderham's action will be I know not but the situation is a critical one; to the building itself and to the health of children and staff. Sewer gas repeatedly backs up and permeates the building with an unsavory odour which is proof that something is wrong with the septic tank.\n\nA few extracts from Principal Woods letter will give you an idea of what conditions are like:\n\n\"DRAIN Pipes: when the hail was thawing on the roof the water gushed out of the split and corroded pipes, again (for the second time) flooded the boys dormitory - a stream, like a creek came down the stair way to the basement. That is nothing unusual, it occurs every time there is a heavy shower. The dormitory floor does not hold water consequently it poured through into the Senior Class room and into the Staff rooms, running down the electric light equipment. Inspite of catching as much as possible with wash tubs, boilers and pails and scooping it up with dustpans, etc., still it came through in the staff sitting room. Our Chapel was spared and consequently our appartment was protected. This was because we had detected the sewer gases coming through the roof...\"\ndrain pipes in the girls dormitory and Irwin and I had found these pipes to be corroded - through and then packed the split with putty and wrapped flannelet sheeting around the split pipes, this checked the force of water coming into that dormitory; fortunately the girls supervisor was on the job and worked desperately to prevent the bed being soaked and water going through the floor. Apparently we must get more putty and sheeting and wrap more pipes. For years the pipe over the Boys Supervisor's room has been split and wrapped. Today the chief offending pipe was over the entrance to the boys dormitory. I am pleased to report that I had invited Dr. Stone -- Regional Supervisor of Health Services -- to come for consultations, I brought him out from Brocket and the hall commenced as he entered the School. I called him up stairs to see for himself how the roof water gushes out of the pipes. After helping the few staff members to scoop-up and mop floors I returned to the apartment, there I found Dr. Stone writing a report on the infernal deluge; upon finding that he was reporting it to the local Agent I commented that that would lay on his desk with my requisitions and sundry estimates for roofing and pipe estimates, he then wrote another report to the Regional Supervisor of Agencies, Calgary. I trust you will convey the urgency of this matter to the Indian Affairs Branch. It is not reasonable to expect the staff to remain here another week, and be flooded out, and with the sewer gases backing up into the children's dormatory, and the rain water coming onto their beds. Neither is it reasonable to have them back while the Principal is responsible for their health. I understand, for ten years the roof has leaked and estimates have been going into the Indian Affairs Branch. For four or five years these pipes have been spilling water in the dormitories. Although I have made requisition regarding the sceptic tank and these pipes and urged contractors and the Agent to get things moving, I find that to yesterdays date nothing was further than the estimate stage in the local office.\"\n\nI look upon this situation as an emergency and trust that Indian Affairs Branch will take immediate action.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nHGC/PAL\n\nSuperintendent.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Jahrig Brothers advise that they have checked the chimney at the St. Cyprian Indian School and they suggest that the existing chimney be demolished to a point 2' below the breech and that the entire chimney be rebuilt from that point with new material. While they could not closely estimate the cost of doing this work, they were prepared to quote a total maximum guarantee cost of $2250.00 for the complete demolition and rebuilding of the chimney on the existing base; alternatively they would carry out this work on a cost plus 10% basis using the above figure as a maximum guarantee.\n\nWhile we realize that you were primarily interested in a report on the condition of this chimney, we pass on the above quotation for your guidance. Jahrig Brothers suggested that we point out to yourselves the precarious state of the existing chimney. The condition that it is in at the present time makes it a very serious hazard since it is apparent that the complete structure is held in place by guy wires alone.

I have tried to get bids and yesterday received from Mr. Osterberg from Lethbridge who built the Pelican Day School, a bid for the bulk work considered necessary to repair the interior of the above school and wish to report as follows:\n\nGirls Wash Room - This bid is according as to what we figured to do although plaster is being used instead of some types of wall before.\n\nDining Room - This is the same as above.\n\nLaundry - I do not remember having decided to do all this work in the laundry that is placed in his bid, or the skylight. The new outside door was brought to our attention as was the entrance hall and stairway. Also repairing the south corner post of the sun porch a small item and should be done. We did not at the time discuss the new floor in the boys dormitory or the fir ply base in the hall where the burlap wainscoting is worn out.\n\nBoys Wash Room - This place is in quite a mess and should be taken care of, in both the boys and the girls wash rooms much expense is being caused by the removal of wash basins and tanks so plastering can be done behind them and then the basins and tanks being replaced. It will be noted that Mr. Osterberg bid on this work is $386.00, as you are well aware of the state of these rooms.\n\nI would very much appreciate if you would report on what you would consider necessary to be done present.\n\nRoofs - In the early spring I was able to receive two quotations from a Calgary and Lethbridge firms, bids on bended roofs as per their Tenders enclosed with this letter. I doubt whether the Dept. will have funds to go ahead with this work, but if funds are available would recommend acceptance of this work from whichever Tender the Dept. would find satisfactory.\n\nPlumbing - With considerable leakage of water from heavy rains and a odor returning from septic tank through the pipes which go through the roof, I am Mr. Pearson inspected the school and checked what was necessary to make this so that no odor or leakage could come down these pipes. His report showed that these pipes were perforated and rusted with holes in them. Mr. Stone on his visit to this Agency last week end was visiting the above school when a severe rain storm accompanied by hail hit this district, he left me a personal letter advising me that water was running down the staircase and that the odor coming into the school was terrible and suggested that I take action immediately to have this work done. I immediately wrote lettered B.F. Neary, Esqr., advising of this emergency and quoting Mr. Pearson's bid asking for authority by return, a copy of night letter as fellows; B.F.

Mr Pearson recommends that if any priority is given to the school work it should be the roof pipes where the sewer gas is escaping.\n\nI received this bid from Mr Pearson on June 7th and was awaiting a bid from Mr Osterberg who was to obtain a bid from a Lethbridge plumber, however when the bid arrived he only bid on a small portion of the necessary work and Mr Osterberg was not prepared to make any changes in the bid and recommended we go ahead with Mr Pearson.\n\nI have tried to cover this school thoroughly as to what is necessary as you are well aware as to what state this school was in, I would be glad if you would write an accompanying letter or report with any letter recommending what you consider is absolutely necessary if funds are low.\n\nAM/JRA\n\nA.

Owing to the limited time at our disposal, this was very hurried, but it was noted that the plaster in the basement rooms was in a terrible condition and should be replaced with something more substantial. I did not inspect the floors in the boys' auditorium. These floors have been in use for many years and are bound to be in poor condition, but replacement is not an absolute necessity.\n\nIt will be noted that the only contractor who has submitted a bid, Mr. Osterberg, has not submitted an itemized tender. A bid of $2388.00 therefore, appears to be high. Furthermore, it is to be noted that he proposes to use cement plaster in replacing the existing plastering. I am not content to state that this is the right thing to do, nor to pass judgment on his quotation. Mr. Osterberg erected the Day school and appears to be a conscientious, capable workman and I believe Mr. McMillan will have difficulty in getting a competitive offer.\n\nThe replacement or repair to the roof and down pipes which are leaking badly and allowing sewer gas to escape throughout the building is Number One. The replacement or repair of the roof Number Two and the wall repairs in the basement third.\n\nTo carry out the entire program would cost over $6000.00, based on the present offers. The physical condition of this school is not good and sooner or later this expenditure must be made. If money is available now, it is recommended that a competent engineer inspect it and call for definite type of work to be done. If this cannot be done right away, the down pipes in the school should be replaced immediately and other replacements follow in due course of time. However, all of it should be done during the summer holidays.\n\nI am also writing in respect to the physical condition of the Sacred Heart School, and would appreciate your reply about both schools as soon as possible.\n\nG.H.

Neary, I am enclosing bids from J.C. Edgar Macleod, Alberta, and a bid I received from R. Osterberg, Lethbridge, which was later cancelled.\n\nIt would seem that numbers 1 and 3 of Edgar's bid would take care of the roof, but I am informed by Mr. Pearson that his bid was made to cover all emergencies that might show up and that the account if bid accepted, would only contain the necessary work done.\n\nIn considering the bids I would compare the work quoted in each bid before price.\n\nYou mentioned tenders for the roof, the two bids I have enclosed originally, one from Calgary and one from Lethbridge are the only satisfactory men in the business I have been able to contact.\n\nA. McMillan, Superintendent\nMacLeod, Alta.\nJuly 10/50\n\nA. McMillan, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBrocket, Alberta.\n\nDear Sir: Re: St. Cyprian School\n\n#1 Rain Leaders:\nTo supplying C.I. sewer pipe roof boxes with lead flashings and labour to make water tight the rain water lead offs\nFirm price - $425.00\n\n#2 Septic Tank:\nTo clean out septic tank and renew broken cleanout in basement approximately - $75.00\n\n#3 Roof Flashing:\nThe fire wall all around this building is badly in need of repair, as the galv. iron flashing does not come down on to the roof and the tar paper roofing around is all broken, allowing all rain or moisture to run down the walls. This should be repapered and tarred all around and then the galv. iron flashing brought down to protect the paper.\nMaterial & labour - approx. - $175.00\n\nThanking you, we remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.C. Edgar and Sons,\nPer J.E. Edgar\nbut to have him submit a tender on that basis. Then, in order to obtain a competitive tender we call in another tradesman who may have different ideas as to what work and materials are required, and he in turn will quote accordingly.\n\nI am recommending that the rain leaders or drain pipe be repaired immediately because of the presence of sewer gas within the interior of the building. Although there is a vast difference between both quotations on this particular work I can see no alternative but to accept Mr. Edgar's tender.\n\nWith regard to the rest of the plumbing work, I can see no alternative but to try to get a plumber to do the work on a day labour basis, with the Department supplying the materials as required.\n\nI do not feel that we will make any real progress with repairs to this school until it is viewed by a competent engineer who can prepare accurate specifications that will enable contractors to bid on the same basis. I therefore hope that you can arrange to have an engineer visit this school as soon as possible.\n\nG.H. Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies.\n\nRFE/lo\nAtts.\nc.c. Mr. McMillan\nDirector,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\n\nAttn: Supt. of Education\n\nRe: St. Cyprian Residential School\n\nUpon receipt of your Army Message of July 24th in which you asked for other tenders for the roofing and plumbing work required at the above school, I contacted Superintendent McMillan. I am now attaching copy of his letter of July 25th, together with copies of J. Edgar and Sons' tender on repairs to the rain leader, septic tank and roof flashing.\n\nTo summarize, Mr. Pearson has bid $825.00 and Mr. Edgar $425.00 to repair the drain pipes. Mr. Pearson has bid $125.00 and Mr. Edgar $75.00 to clean the septic tank. Mr. Pearson has bid on repairing the heating boiler and installing new grates in the hot water heater. Mr. Edgar has not bid on these. Mr. Edgar has bid on the roof flashing and Mr. Pearson has not.\n\nUnder cover of my letter of July 7th I sent you two tenders for re-roofing both residential schools at Brocket. You will see that Mr. McMillan has not been able to obtain any more tenders on this work.\n\nQuite frankly, we are getting nowhere with the repairs to these two schools for the simple reason that neither Mr. McMillan nor myself is competent to lay down accurate specifications that would enable contractors to bid intelligently on the same work. I am sure you will realize that these are sizeable structures and that it is unreasonable to expect a layman to decide specifically what repairs are needed and what materials should be used. Our only possible approach to a solution is to call in a practicing tradesman. He invariably recommends certain repairs and alterations and the use of certain materials, and we have no alternative.\n\n(cont'd)\nOttawa, July 31, 1950.\n\nMr. G.H.

Ironer surplus at Brocket draws too much current for use at the Sioux School. Other Principals have also informed us that they do not need this piece of equipment. Will you please therefore instruct us what you wish done with the ironer?\n\nIt is unfortunate that such an expensive piece of equipment was supplied the Brocket school especially when we asked especially for a much smaller ironer. It looks to me as though upon requisition from the Roman Brocket school duplicate equipment was supplied both schools. If the Simplex ironer is sent to a non Anglican school it would be appreciated if the value of same could be put to the purchase of new equipment for the St. Paul's (blood) laundry. The equipment there (save a recently supplied washer) is in a dangerous and outworn condition.\n\nCould you please confirm your arrangement, made in conversation with General A9/8/50, to supply the Brocket School with a Beatty machine with a D.C. motor?\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSuperintendent\n\nIndian Affairs.

We believe that a 110 volt, 60 cycle, 1 phase motor will solve your problem. This motor will be one-quarter (1/4) horsepower.\n\nAt present we are in a position to supply this new A.C. motor on very short notice. However, there are just a few requests we must ask of your Department. As we do not know the present location of this machine, we would ask that you contact the School concerned and have them ship the present D.C. motor to our Home Plant here in Newmarket, as soon as possible. At the same time inform us (attention of this Department) the exact shipping address where the new motor is to be sent. This new motor will be shipped \"Charge\" and we believe the charge will be directed to your Department. However, will you please clarify this in your letter.\n\nWe also believe that the D.C. motor now on the machine has never been used. Upon receipt of this motor in our Plant, in unused condition, full credit will be directed to the Department concerned.\n\nHoping this will solve your problem with the least possible delay, we remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nCANADIAN HOFFMAN MACHINERY COMPANY LIMITED.\n\nD.

The Indian Agent was also advised\nabout the matter and he subsequently advised us that he\nwas assisting the principal in arranging for the new barn.\n\nOn October 4th we forwarded Mr. McMillan a telegram,\na copy of which I enclose and following a telegram received\nfrom him we sent the Indian Agent an accountable advance of\n$2,000.00 for labour. We heard nothing further from him\nregarding the barn until December when he forwarded a voucher\nrequesting an additional $500.00 over and above the $2,000.\nadvance. From the information on the voucher it appeared\nthat either the principal or the Agent had made a contract\nwith Mr. O. Playford for the labour. We requested and re-\nceived a copy of this contract and I enclose copy of same\nfor your information.\n\nIt was a very irregular procedure for the Agent to\naward a contract amounting to $2,500. No official at head\noffice can do this without the Deputy Minister's approval.\n\nWe are having some difficulty in having the account\npassed for payment by the Treasury Branch and we would ap-\npreciate it if you would let us have an early report on\nthe barn, stating if you consider that we received full\nvalue for the money paid to Playford.\n\nBernard F.

Mr. E.W. Cole. Our Agent, Mr. McMillan was asked to assist and co-operate in having the work properly done and the total cost not to exceed the amount authorized.\n\nWe know Mr. McMillan carried out these instructions. He assisted Mr. Cole in securing the lumber. They got the services of Mr. Orin Playford, and Mr. Cole completed the contract which was submitted to you through the Indian Agency office.\n\nAs you no doubt are aware, the barn was erected on the site of a barn which was burned to the ground in 1946. At first it was thought that only a flat topped building could be erected to replace this for the amount of money allowed, but the foundation was in such good condition that the contractor advanced more quickly than replacement than expected, and it was possible even to put a good hip roof on it. Mr. Playford apparently was new in the district and wished to make a good name for himself. He proved to be a very capable builder and with his crew of four or five completed the building in about six weeks at a total cost of $4,995.00 of which $2500.00 was paid to him as per the contract of October.\n\nOn December 4, 1947, I inspected this building and was very well impressed with it. The workmanship was good. It was well equipped, and in my opinion the best value for the amount of money spent that I had seen in recent years. I complimented both the Agent and Mr. Cole on the very fine job they had done.\n\nAs for payment to Mr. Playford, it is hardly necessary to say that his contract was well within the amount that would be normally charged to a building costing $5,000.00. As you know, labor costs on such invariably run to 60% of the total cost and in this instance, it is only 50%. I have no hesitation in recommending payment.\n\n(Signed) G.H. Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies.\n| QUANTITY | DESCRIPTION                  | WEIGHT | PRICE | AMOUNT | TOTAL |\n|----------|------------------------------|--------|-------|--------|-------|\n| 7        | Prs Hinges                   |        |       | 1.75   |       |\n| 9        | Doz.

Playford against money due to him from the government for construction work at the reserve. At the time you gave us your assurance that Mr. Playford had given you an order for the payment of the money due him, direct to this bank and that covering cheque would reach us in a matter of three or four weeks. As it is now over four months since this loan was arranged and as no word has been received by us from the government in connection therewith, we would ask you to investigate and advise us as soon as possible when payment will reach us.\n\nYours truly,\n\nManager.\nIndian Affairs Branch  \nDept of Mines & Resources  \nOttawa.\n\nAttention B F Neary Esqr.\n\nI beg to advise that I have received from the Royal Bank of Canada at Pincher Creek, a letter regarding the balance of Funds owing by the Branch to Mr Playford, for which he signed an affidavit sent by the Branch to turn this money over to the Royal Bank.\n\nAt the completion of the work on the St Cyprians Barn he asked me to advise the Bank of the amount owing to him, so as to get a loan for his shop. Some correspondence resulted re the amount, but I considered the matter closed, and payment would be made when I received a copy of Mr Gooderham's letter to the Indian Affairs Branch of File 116-4B-4 of the 16th of February, when he recommended payment.\n\nCan I be advised as to when payment will be made, and I am enclosing the letter from the Bank Manager.\n\nAnthony M.

Mr. E.S.W. Cole. Our Agent, Mr. McMillan was asked to assist and co-operate in having the work properly done and the total cost not to exceed the amount authorized.\n\nWe know Mr. McMillan carried out these instructions. He assisted Mr. Cole in securing the lumber. They got the services of Mr. Orin Playford, and Mr. Cole completed the contract which was submitted to you through the Indian Agency office.\n\nAs you no doubt are aware, the barn was erected on the site of a barn which was burned to the ground in 1946. At first it was thought that only a flat roofed building could be erected to replace this for the amount of money allowed, but the foundation was in such good condition that the contractor advanced more quickly in the replacement than expected, and it was possible then to put a good hip roof on it.\n\nMr. Playford apparently was new in the district and wished to make a good name for himself. He proved to be a very capable builder and with his crew of four or five completed the building in about six weeks at a total cost of $4,985.00, of which $2500.00 was paid to him as per the contract of October.\n\nOn December 4, 1947, I inspected this building and was very well impressed with it. The workmanship was good. It was well equipped, and in my opinion the best value for the amount of money spent that I had seen in recent years. I complimented both the Agent and Mr. Cole on the very fine job they had done.\n\nAs for payment to Mr. Playford, it is hardly necessary to say that his contract was well within the amount that would be normally charged to a building costing $5,000.00. As you know, labor costs on such invariably run to 60% of the total cost and in this instance, it is only 50%. I have no hesitation in recommending payment.\n\nG. H. Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nEarly in April, 1948, you advised me that the following funds are provided in your estimates, 1948-49, for the above-named school:\n\n\"New roothouse and painting and repairs to staff rooms and residence $3,000.00\n\nRefrigeration equipment 850.00\"\n\nI have just received word from this school that they are worried about the roothouse as your local Agent informs them that he has not yet received any authority for this work. I can assure you, from personal inspection, that the present structure is not only useless but is unsafe for anyone to enter. As the school has 1/2 acres of potatoes planted, in addition to other vegetables, it is of great importance that the roothouse be rebuilt before the crops are harvested and it is requested, therefore, that your Agent be given authority to proceed with the work of rebuilding as early as possible.\n\nThe report from the school also contains the following:\n\n\"There are several small repair jobs around the school which really should be attended to while the children are away; for example, some tables in the children's dining room need bracing and a few extra tacks and a coat of paint. Some places in the lower part of the dining room walls need patching with plaster and the whole lower half painting. The wash rooms need cement repairing, the kitchen also should have a coat of paint on the lower part and the floors of the halls and stairs around the battleship linoleum need stain varnishing, etc.\"\n\np.t.o.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6370, file 763-5, part 8)\nIt is requested that your Agent be authorized to have these minor repairs and painting carried out during the holiday period this summer. It is not very desirable to have wet paint around while small children are in residence if this can be avoided by carrying out the work when they are away.\n\nMay I be advised as early as convenient as to what you can do in regard to the above services.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nHenry G. Cook\nSuperintendent\n", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-06", "created": "2025-10-06", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdfs_sask_test/c-8721.pdf", "olmocr-version":
