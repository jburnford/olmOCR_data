Mr. Williams.\n\nFRIDAY, SEPT. 4, 1885.\n\nLAND POLICY.\n\nWe proceed to take up the subject of the land policy in the Territories at the point where we left off in our last number. Our object is to demonstrate the great disadvantage of the present policy of reservation of odd sections considered with regard to its effects upon the settlement of a country at its initial stage, and in view of the advantages which have come in so far as sufficient progress has been made in sufficient progress to begin to turn their attention to matters affecting communities rather than individuals. That this stage was arrived at in the district under discussion may be gathered from reference to a memorial embodying the requirements of the people drawn up and presented to Sir John A. Macdonald at his own request by the members speaking through Messrs. C. Macdonald and D. H. Macdonald, in which the disadvantages of the position of the Territories as compared with Manitoba\u2014the result of the want of municipal facilities\u2014is brought prominently into view.\n\nSince that time municipal organization has been provided for, but the fact that provincial organization having been still withheld, and consequently the capitulation or other grant given, leaves the district, speaking without a reserve, renders it doubly hard that all such social improvements as have to be paid for directly by the settlers, owing to the reservation of odd sections from settlement, must bear their cost and be defrayed by one half of the number of individuals over whom it would otherwise be spread. Were the improvements spoken of such as could be easily dispensed with for a time the matter would be of minor consequence, but when they include such vital matters as churches, schools, roads, etc., there can be no question as to the necessity for giving the subject our immediate attention. With regard to the matter of providing schools for the children of settlers we have repeatedly spoken most strongly, and the fact that the exhaustion of the Territorial funds for that purpose has thrown the whole onus of their support directly on the people renders it imperative that they should be allowed to take up their homesites in order that they may be able to bear the burden laid upon their shoulders. It must not be supposed, however, that in this most important matter of education the best interest of each individual entitled by the law at present enforced system of scattered settlement is the only one because it has to be remembered that the question of expense is not set aside by these remarks; the fact that in a rural district let the school be located in the most central position possible, the distance to be travelled by children in going to and coming from it, even under the most favorable circumstances, is a very serious consideration in a community where the winters last so long and are of so severe a nature. That distance should be unnecessary, and a school serving a hard district and resembling in some respects the moat in the case of children whose homes are furthest removed from the centre of a school district, it is not asserting too much to say that it practically cannot be made to be accomplished, however reluctantly, to grow up in ignorance\u2014an evil which it is quite superfluous to enlarge upon. The bearing of the system upon the schools has been dwelt upon merely as an illustration of how purely as a matter of expediency applies to churches, nor can there be the slightest difficulty in extending the principle\u2014certain modifications\u2014to everything in the shape of necessary improvements in the shape of necessary communications. Enough has probably been said to show that a change is not only desirable but absolutely necessary, and we may upon a future occasion be able to suggest some means by which it might be made without entailing hardship upon any interested party.\n\nTHE CENSUS.\n\nIt would perhaps be unfair to assert that the present taking of the census of the inhabitants of the Territories with a view to giving them representation in the Dominion Parliament is a result of the recent rebellion, but the fact that the Government had previously to that unfortunate affair declared its intention of pursuing this course at an early date, but more the less it may possibly be that the census required to be definitely attended to more promptly than would have been the case had nothing of a startling nature occurred to direct the attention of the whole Dominion to our affairs. As the evil has taken place, it is impossible to spend time in regretting what cannot be remedied, but there is every use in trying to manage now to extract all possible good from what has already happened. The Government will find that the people of the Territories, so far from being unwilling, are willing to be thankful for small mercies, if only they understand that there exists an honest desire to do something for them. If other matters commissionerships of the same stamp as Mr. Spencer, who has been appointed to put through the required work in this district, there will be no unnecessary delay, and the census will be completed in due time when we shall be in a position to send down representatives to Ottawa. Our readers may remember that we long ago advised the people to direct all their energies to this one matter, because as we stated when one allowed a hearing in the Dominion House, we still only have to blame ourselves for the selection of unsuitable men to represent us, should we fail to speedily obtain redress of the minor grievances, which seem of so much greater importance to those who suffer from them than to those who give them without explanation of their real significance\u2014from a distance. The North West Council must before long as at present constituted die a natural death, and give place to a new generation of Legislators, and then there will not be much left for the heart of the settler to desire. The only other change of much importance required is the alteration of the electoral districts, whereby we feel sure that we hope to see the new Minister of the Interior before long convinced of. It is quite within the range of possibility that the Government may mistrust the temper of the people, and not be doing enough actively to hasten on the time when they will become a power in Dominion politics\u2014but we believe that if they do us justice now, and do admit that they appear to be justified in this case as in others, especially needed\u2014they will be surprised at the amount of warm support they will receive from the settlers generally. It is very intelligible that men who have come to the Territories from places where they have been trained to enjoy and exercise political privileges should fret under the galling position of being taxed at least as much as their fellow-countrymen yet deprived of equality in other matters, but that matter righted, there is no danger to be apprehended from the class of men who compose the pioneers of the Territories. We sincerely trust that nothing will occur to retard the gathering of the harvest, and the near prospect of obtaining it casts a most cheering light over the naturally resulting gloom of what has occurred in this district.\n\nDressed Flooring, $48\nUndressed do., 42\nDressed Siding, 48\nUndressed do., 42\nSheeting, 30\nCommon Lumber, 35\nDimension do., 40\n\nLath, 75 cts. per bundle.\nShingles, $6 50 per M.\n\nWe are prepared to Contract for Buildings as cheaply as any firm in Town\n\nBuilders paying Cash or giving good security for LARGE Orders, will have a reduction made.\n\nTHOS.

As ill luck would have it, that break which was so much needed, after a long continued spell of fine weather had just occurred, and although there was not any rain, the wind was blowing strongly, cold blowing steadily, which increased at times by violent gusts, which made the shooting very difficult.\n\nIn the afternoon the discomfort of the competitors was much increased by showers of hail, which although they continued, were very heavy while they lasted. In spite of this the interest remained very much until the finish of the three matches, viz.: The Ladies Match, The Merchants and The Association; which formed the programme of the first day's proceedings.\n\nThe ladies prizes were contested for by competitors who were thoroughly equal, and the result will be very closely divided into prizes later and their scores. The total amount of prizes represent a very handsome sum of money, in the circumstances of the settlement considered.\n\nThe rewards paid out in actual cash, consist of twenty-five dollars in gold coins articles which formed the other prizes, brought the money value up to a total of $150.\n\nLADIES' MATCH.\n\nRange, 400 yards, shots.\n\n1.
