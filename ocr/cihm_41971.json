In the present work, an endeavor has been made so to digest its varied contents, as to enable the tourist to examine, seriatim, every object of interest along the route he may select, and thus to ascertain what is most deserving of his attention: for example, assuming the city of Albany as one of the radiating points, a brief account of the city and its interesting objects, modes of conveyance, &c. is given: then follow tables of distances from Albany to another point of departure\u2014Utica, for instance\u2014and then a concise description of each intermediate place of any importance, with directions to such cu-\nPREFACE.\n\nriosities in and around each as should not be overlooked by an intelligent inquirer. In this manner every leading route by railroad or otherwise, is concisely, and, it is hoped, satisfactorily treated. One of the most important features of the present work, is brevity; a quality that, we are sure, cannot fail to recommend it to the favorable attention of the traveller, who is, whilst in transitu, unable or at least unwilling to enter into those elaborate and fatiguing details, which disfigure most similar works. In conclusion, the author has sedulously endeavored to construct such a work as he himself has often felt the want of whilst travelling, and such a one as would naturally suggest itself to the mind of any intelligent traveller.\nGENERAL VIEW.\u2014The state of New-York extends over 43\u00b0 of lat. and nearly 7\u00b0 of longitude, the whole forming an outline of about 1,400 miles in length, which encloses an area of 49,000 square miles; having N. Canada; W. Pennsylvania and Lakes Ontario and Erie; S. Pennsylvania and New-Jersey; and E. Connecticut, Massachusetts and Vermont.

Pennyan.\n\nPhysical Structure.\u2014The state, intersected by several mountain chains, presents a great diversity of soil and climate. Though the western parts are less broken than those of the east and north, yet the entire surface, with partial exceptions, is either hilly or mountainous.\n\nThe Hudson flows from a mountainous region, and is precipitated into a deep valley, at or near its junction with the Mohawk. The Hudson valley is one of the most remarkable in the hydrography of the United States. From the Mohawk to Sandy Hook it may be regarded as a long narrow bay rather than a river. The banks are, for the most part, abrupt, rising in some places to the height of 1200 or 1500 feet; in many parts precipitous, as at the palisades, a few miles above the city of New-York, and scarcely ever less than 100 or 200 feet above the surface of the river. The pass, known as the Highlands, is flanked on both sides by enormous walls of nearly vertical rock, which presents every variety of form. The rude and deep valleys that intervene between the gigantic prominences, the dense and almost impenetrable forests by which they are covered, and the\nmajestic grandeur of the mountain peaks, afford one of the most impressive landscapes to be found in nature. Here the great primitive ranges pass the Hudson, and here only do the ocean tides penetrate into the vast interior plains of the United States. The ridges of which we are speaking, after leaving the Hudson, deflect towards the north, pass through Dutchess County into Massachusetts, thence into Vermont, where they are known as the \"Green Mountains,\" and thence into Canada.\n\nThe range forming the N. W. limits of Sullivan and Ulster, passes into Greene, where it attains its greatest elevation; and thence through Schoharie, Otsego, Herkimer, and Montgomery, crosses the Mohawk by the Little Falls, enters Herkimer, assuming the name of Sacondago, and finally crosses the St. Lawrence at the \"Thousand Islands.\" One of the lateral ridges of this group extends towards the north, and attains to the height of upwards of 5,000 feet: Mount Marcy, the culminating point, is said to be 5,467 feet high. The Catskill group, the next in point of elevation, rises to its greatest height a few miles west of the town of Catskill. Its principal peak, the Round Top, is 3,804, and Pine Orchard House, a celebrated place of resort, is 3,000 feet above the adjacent river. All the subordinate chains east of the Hudson pursue a course nearly north.\n\nNearly the whole of the northern part of the state, comprehending Fulton, Warren, Essex, Hamilton, Herkimer and parts of Montgomery, Saratoga, Washington, Clinton, Franklin, St. Lawrence, Lewis, and Oneida Counties, belongs to the primitive formation; as does also the south eastern portion, embracing parts of Orange, Ulster, Greene, Putnam, Dutchess, Columbia, Rensselaer, and some other counties. These two groups are separated by an elongated deposit of sedimentary rocks. The first mentioned is flanked on the S. E. by a spur of the lower transition; on the N. E. by tertiary, and on all sides by transition rocks. It is\ncomposed of granite, gneiss, primitive limestone, hypersthene, serpentine and sienite; these, with the addition of mica and talcose slates, form the second group. With some exceptions the remaining portions of the state may be referred to the transition and the old red sandstone series. The first is composed of sandstone, shales, limestone grit, salt, gypsum, iron ore, conglomerates, &c.; and the latter of micaceous shales of various hues, sandstones, conglomerates, trap, grits, &c. The Catskill Mountains occupy the principal field of the old red sandstone, which is here largely developed. These several formations abound in their appropriate minerals and fossils. In the primitive are found iron ore in great abundance, both magnetic and specular oxides; ores of copper, lead, and zinc have been found, but, with partial exceptions, have not been wrought to much advantage. In the transition rocks are found salt in solution, which is manufactured to a great extent, chiefly in Onondaga county; gypsum, water lime, argillaceous oxide of iron, limonite, marble, several varieties, silicious sandstone, a valuable material for building; shales and red sandstone of various textures. Peat and marl are more generally diffused. The principal fossil remains of this group are the atrypas, bellerophon, calymene, isotelus, &c.\n\nThe plains of New-York are few in number, and limited in extent: the principal are, one on the eastern end of Long Island; a long narrow strip on the south side of Lake Ontario; a few alluvial bottoms along some of the streams, and in the elevated table lands of the mountain region. The principal Lakes are, Ontario and Erie, the former of which is common to New-York and Canada, and the latter to N. York, Ohio, Canada, and Michigan; Lake Champlain, which forms a part of the boundary between New-York and Vermont; Lake George, a tributary of the preceding; Black Lake; Oneida Lake; Cayuga Lake; Seneca, Canandaigua, Skaneateles, and\nSTATE OF NEW-YORK.\n\nCrooked Lakes, near the centre of the state; Chautauque, Long, Owasco, Racket, Otsego, &c. The Rivers consist of the Hudson, which rises in the northern part of the state, runs in a general S. E. course to Sandy Hill, and thence due S., to its discharge into the Atlantic Ocean, 340 miles in length. The Mohawk, which unites with the Hudson a few miles above Albany, is the only branch of the latter worthy of notice, 150 miles. The St. Lawrence washes the N. W. quarter of the state for about 100 miles, forming the boundary between New-York and Canada west.\n\nThe chief affluents of this portion of the St. Lawrence are,\u2014Racket, 145, Oswegatchie, 140, and Black Rivers, 125 miles in length; which rise in the high grounds near the sources of the Hudson. Those of Lake Ontario are, Oswego and Genesee, 150 miles in length; and of Lake Erie, Buffalo Creek, 40 miles long. The southern portion of the State is watered by the sources of the Delaware and Susquehanna, rivers of the Atlantic, and those of the Alleghany, which flows into the Ohio at Pittsburg, Pa. The minor rivers are,\u2014Beaver, Canisteo, Chateaugay, Grass, Indian, St. Regis, Sacondaga, &c.\n\nISLANDS.\u2014Long and Staten Islands; the former about 150 miles long, and of a mean breadth of 18 miles; and the latter 18 by 12 miles, are situated in the S. E. quarter of the State; and Grand Island, in the Strait of Niagara.\n\nTHE WATER FALLS are those of Niagara, Trenton, Genesee, Cohoes, &c.; all which will be described hereafter.\n\nRAILWAYS.\u2014The principal Railways, finished or in the course of execution, are:\u2014\n\n1.

The latter is President of the Senate, which consists of 32, and the House of Assembly of 128 members. The former are elected for four years and the latter for one year.\nFor the election of Senators the State is divided into eight districts, each of which chooses four Senators, one of whom is elected every year. The members of the Lower House are elected by counties, and are apportioned according to population. The general election is held in October or November, as the Legislature may direct, which meets on the first Tuesday in January.\n\nThe Chancellor and Judges are appointed by the Governor and Senate. The former, and the Justices of the Supreme and Circuit Courts, hold their offices during good behavior, but not after they attain the age of sixty years. The Judges of the County Courts hold their offices for a term of five years.\n\nThe right of suffrage is accorded to every white male who has attained the age of 21 years, and resided in the State one year next preceding the election, and six months in the county. Men of color who possess an unencumbered freehold estate of the value of $250 are entitled to vote.\n\nHistory.\u2014The leading features in the early History of this now important State is the navigation of the Hudson, in 1609, by Henry Hudson, an Englishman, in the service of the Dutch East India Company. Settlements on the river soon followed, when Fort Orange (Albany) was erected.\n\nIn 1612 settlements were made by Dutch emigrants on Manhattan Island, chiefly along its southern shore, to which they gave the name of \"New Amsterdam.\" The colony, under the title of the \"New Netherlands,\" soon began to flourish, and accordingly attracted the attention of the English, who now claimed a prior right to the country, but ultimately relinquished the claim, when the New Netherlanders were permitted to enlarge their settlements without further disturbance at that time. They were, however, greatly annoyed by the Swedes on the Delaware and the English settlers in the East, with whom border contests were of frequent occurrence.\nOne of the results of this condition of things was the relinquishment of a part of Long Island to the English, in 1650. Stimulated by this important acquisition, the English renewed their claim, and in 1664 the entire country was granted to the Duke of York and Albany, by his brother, King Charles II. The Dutch, unable to resist the force sent against them, surrendered to Colonel Nichols, who at once assumed the government, and changed the name of the Province to New York. In 1673, during the contest with the English, the Dutch regained possession of the colony; but, on the termination of hostilities, in the following year, was restored to the English, with whom it continued until wrested from them by the revolution of 1776. In 1683 the first Colonial Assembly met and assumed the exclusive power of enacting laws and levying taxes. During the revolution, which succeeded the accession of the Duke of York to the throne of England, the Colonists took forcible possession of the fort, and declared for the Prince of Orange; and Jacob Leisler, a prominent leader in the movement, assumed the office of Governor. He maintained his authority for a time against all opposition; but, owing to his arbitrary and unjust proceedings, was, after several bloody conflicts, compelled to surrender the government into the hands of Colonel Slaughter, who had been appointed Governor by King William; and who caused Leisler to be apprehended. He and one of his accomplices, named Milbourne, were executed soon after; though, as it appears, contrary to the intentions of the Governor, who designed to pardon them. Nothing of moment occurred to disturb the Colonists during the period from the revolution in England, in 1688, down to 1741, when they were thrown into great alarm by a supposed plot of the blacks to burn the city; which, however, appears to have been unfounded.\n\nIn 1765 the City of New York was the seat of a Continental Congress, and in 1776 it was occupied\nby the British, who retained possession until November 25, 1783. In 1785 Congress met here, and in 1789 the first Congress under the new Constitution assembled, when the first President was inaugurated in New York.\n\nDuring the contests with the French in Canada, and the more recent wars between the Americans and British, New York became the field of important conflicts; and the entire State may hence be regarded as classic ground. Some brief accounts of those conflicts will be given hereafter, in their appropriate places.\n\nEducation.\u2014There are, in the State, several institutions, established by law for the promotion of knowledge; the chief of which are:\n\nA State University, located in the city; University of the City of New York; Union College, in Schenectady; Hamilton College, in Oneida County; Geneva College, to which a Medical Department is attached; College of Physicians and Surgeons, in the city; Albany Medical College; New York Institution for the Deaf and Dumb, a few miles above the city; Institution for the Blind. There are, also, distributed over the State, 140 Academies and a vast number of Common or Primary Schools. The fund for the support of the latter exceeds $2,000,000.\n\nCITY OF NEW YORK.\n\nNew-York, the Metropolis of the State, and the most populous, wealthy, and commercial city of the Union, is situated at the confluence of the Hudson and East rivers, on one of the finest harbors in the country; in N. Lat. 40\u00b0 42' 40\", and E. Long. 29\u00b0 54' 30\" from the Capitol, at Washington; having E. the strait called East river, which separates it from\nLong Island and unites the bay of New York with Long Island sound; W. the Hudson, which forms a part of the boundary between the States of New-York and New-Jersey; S. New-York bay; N. Spuyten Duyvel creek and Harlem river.\n\nThe city, properly so called, or that portion of the island where the population is mostly concentrated, occupies the southern quarter of Manhattan or New-York island; the whole of which, including the villages of Harlem, Bloomingdale, Yorkville, and Manhattanville, together with some adjacent islands, are under the exclusive jurisdiction of the City Corporation, and constitute the County of New-York. According to the census of 1840, the city, with the suburbs just mentioned, contained 312,710 inhabitants. The population at this time, (September, 1843), no doubt exceeds 350,000. The densely built part of the island, or \"the city,\" has an outline of nearly 12 miles in length. The principal street, Broadway, in which most of the retail fancy business is transacted, is a splendid street, 80 feet in width, extending northward from the Battery to Union Park, a distance of nearly three miles.\n\nNearly the whole of the lower part of the city is devoted to commerce and its kindred pursuits; and, since the establishment of omnibuses, which now traverse every part of the city, merchants and others doing business in that quarter have their residences in the upper or more modern portion of the town.\n\nThe streets in the old part of the city are mostly irregular and narrow; but those of a more recent date are generally straight, wide, and well paved, and intersect each other at right angles.\n\nIn the early stages of the city, narrow, inconvenient and ill paved streets, lined with dull, heavy looking buildings, were its characteristic features; but so great is the alteration in these respects, that at present but few cities can boast of wider or handsomer streets, more sumptuous public buildings, or better constructed and splendid private dwellings.\nWall-street is almost exclusively occupied by the Banks, Brokers, and others engaged in fiscal operations; Pearl-street, by the Dry Goods and Hardware Merchants; Front-street, by the Wholesale Grocers, Commission Merchants, &c.; and South-street, by persons engaged in Foreign Commerce. The Third Avenue, a continuation of the Bowery, is the principal outlet towards the N. E. It is Macadamized as far as Harlem, a distance of about 7 miles, and is one of the finest paved ways in the country. Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth Avenues are wide, handsome, and partially paved.\n\nNew-York is supplied with an abundance of excellent water, by means of a capacious aqueduct, which conveys the water of the Croton river, a branch of the Hudson, a distance of nearly 42 miles. This magnificent work, which has been effected chiefly through the exertions of the Corporation and the public spirit of the citizens, will have cost, when entirely completed, not less than $12,000,000. (For an elaborate description of the Croton Aqueduct, see Tanner's Account of the Internal Improvements of the United States.)\n\nThere are two Gas Companies, which supply gas, not only to the streets, shops, and factories, but also to many private dwellings.\n\nBesides the Park, Union Square, &c., which will be noticed presently, there are several other public walks in various parts of the city, as Washington Square, near the University; Tompkins' Square, in the N. E. quarter of the city; University Place, St. John's Park, &c.\n\nNew-York Bay, the recipient of the noble Hudson, communicates with the Atlantic ocean by three distinct channels, to wit:\u2014one by the \"Narrows,\" at the point of nearest contact of Long and Staten islands, which conducts into what is termed the Lower Bay, and thence past Sandy Hook and the S. W. end of Long Island into the ocean; one through Kill Van\nKuhl, or \"the Kills,\" Staten island sound, and Amboy bay, and one through the East river and Long island sound; which form a navigable communication between the city and the populous towns on the shores of Long island, Connecticut, and Rhode island. The first is used almost exclusively by vessels engaged in the foreign trade, and those destined for a southern port. The Hudson, one of the finest navigable streams in the world, affords an uninterrupted water communication with the towns of Newburg, Poughkeepsie, Catskill, Hudson, Albany, Troy, &c., and through them with a vast extent of country in every direction. There are several small islands in the bay, below the city; which, with their castles and forts, give additional beauty to the scene. No spectacle can be finer than that presented by the harbor, thus studded with green islands, when viewed in connection with the city, with its lofty spires, domes, and shipping. The high grounds on Staten Island and those of Brooklyn afford such a view.\n\nThe Battery, an enclosure which is situated on the extreme southern point of the island, forms one of the most delightful promenades of the city. It is a place of great resort, and is occasionally used by the military, on gala days. \"Castle Garden,\" a sort of appendage of the Battery, with which it communicates by a draw-bridge, is also much frequented.\n\nThe Bowling Green, a small oval area, near the Battery, has recently become an object of attention, in consequence of the erection of a beautiful fountain in its centre. The arrangement of the jets is admirable: they are so distributed as to represent, on one side of the rocky mound, from which the water is ejected, an unbroken fall of 12 or 15 feet in height; and on the other, a succession of tiny cascades; forming, altogether, one of the most tasty ornaments of this city of fountains. The beauty of this fountain is greatly enhanced when illuminated at night; for which purpose gas lamps are stationed around the base of the rocks.\nPassing up Broadway, the next object worthy of attention is Trinity Church, now erecting. Its exterior walls are composed of an highly indurated sandstone, chiseled and wrought in the most admirable style. Its depth, from front to rear, is 189 feet, width 84, height 64, and height of the spire 264 feet. It will, no doubt, be a magnificent structure.\n\nThe City Hotel, the next extensive building, is at the corner of Cedar-street and Broadway.\n\nA short distance above the City Hotel, at the corner of Broadway and Fulton streets, stands St. Paul's Church, one of the finest buildings in the city, with a spire 234 feet in height. On the right, and nearly opposite St. Paul's, commences the Park, another public walk, also decorated with a fountain. The Park is a triangular field, surrounded by an iron railing, and ornamented by trees, paved walks, &c.\n\nIt contains the City Hall, one of the most splendid and extensive buildings in the city. It is 216 in front, 105 in depth, and 65 feet in height. The front and ends, as well as the outer columns, are of white marble. The rear wall is composed of the red sandstone, so common here. The original cost of this structure was upwards of $500,000. It is occupied by the city councils and courts of law. The governor of the state, for the time being, has an audience chamber in the second story, which is decorated with portraits of distinguished Americans. The Mechanics' Institute holds its meetings in one of the basement rooms of the City Hall, and the American Institute, in a building in the rear of the Hall, formerly occupied as the County Alms-house.\n\nOn the east side of Broadway, nearly opposite the south entrance of the Park, is Clinton Hall, the upper rooms of which are occupied by the American Museum, and others by the Mercantile Library, consisting of 23,000 volumes.\n\nProceeding up Broadway a few steps above St. Paul's Church, the Astor House presents itself. This\nCITY OF NEW-YORK.\n\nis an immense hotel, built by J. J. Astor, and is justly regarded as one of the best in the city. A short distance above the Astor, on the same side of Broadway, is Peale's Museum, and about half a mile further on, is the Academy of Design, and New-York Society Library, both in the same building, which is situated at the corner of Broadway and Leonard-street, and in which the annual exhibitions of the Academy are held. The library consists of 40,000 volumes. A commodious Reading Room is connected with this institution. The Lyceum of Natural History next presents itself in Broadway, near Prince-street. The object of this institution is to promote physical science in all its relations. The Academy is rich in specimens in the various departments of Natural History, which are admirably arranged. At the intersection of the Bowery, Broadway, and the Fourth Avenue, is Union Park, a beautiful promenade with a magnificent fountain.\u2014In the distance from the Battery to Union Park several other handsome churches, some splendid private mansions and hotels, in no way inferior to those just mentioned, will arrest the attention of the stranger. Among the latter are\u2014\n\nPhiladelphia Hotel, where the steamboats land, foot of Battery Place\u2014Battery Hotel, corner of Battery Place and Greenwich street; connected with the above\u2014Atlantic Hotel; to which is attached a splendid garden, where music is to be heard every evening\u2014promenade and refreshments; opposite the Bowling Green and Fountain\u2014Bunker's Mansion House; a quiet, orderly, home-like Hotel\u2014Blanchard's Globe Hotel\u2014St. George's Hotel; similar to the above\u2014Waverly House, corner of Exchange Place and Broadway\u2014Tremont Temperance House, corner of Pine-street and Broadway\u2014Croton Hotel; also on the temperance plan\u2014148 Broadway\u2014Cafe Tortoni; conducted by Mr. Bardotte, in the style of a similar house in Paris. The next object worthy of\na traveller's attention is the Map Establishment of T. R. Tanner, 153 Broadway, west side; where they can be supplied with all traveling works published in this country; maps, guide and geographical works\u2014Howard House; first class hotel, corner of Maiden Lane and Broadway; a fine prominent building\u2014Franklin House, corner of Dey-street and Broadway; also an excellent Hotel\u2014American Hotel, corner of Barclay-street and Broadway; conducted by Mr. Cozzens, so well known at the Military Academy, West Point. This hotel is a resort of the officers of the Army and Navy\u2014Washington Hotel, corner of Reade-street and Broadway\u2014Athen\u00e6um Hotel, corner of Leonard-street and Broadway\u2014Carlton House, corner of Leonard-street and Broadway.\n\nAs Broadway abounds in objects of interest, this may be regarded as the leading route for strangers in viewing the city, we shall now proceed to describe or point out such other objects in the several quarters of the city as may seem to deserve notice.\n\nCustom House, at the corner of Nassau and Wall streets. This is built in imitation of the Parthenon at Athens. Its exterior walls are of white marble, and the whole edifice is so constructed, inside and out, as to be entirely fire proof. Each front contains an entablature, with several Doric columns of white marble. The business hall is circular, and surmounted by a dome which is supported by 16 Corinthian columns, 30 feet in height. The entire length of the building is 200 feet, breadth 90, and height 80 feet. It was erected by order of the General Government, at a cost of $1,175,000.\n\nMerchants' Exchange, in Wall-street, occupies the site of a similar structure, which was destroyed by fire a few years since. Its front on Wall-street is 200 feet, depth 171 and height 77 feet; from its base to the vertex of the dome, 124 feet. It is constructed throughout of granite, brought from Quincy, in Massachusetts. The front recess is decorated with 18\nIonic columns, each formed of a single block of granite, 38 feet in height and 4\u00bd feet in diameter.\u2014The Rotunda, or Exchange Room, is 100 in diameter, and 90 feet high: it contains 8 Corinthian columns, of Italian marble, each 41 feet high and 4\u00bd feet in diameter. The Exchange was built by a joint stock company, at an expense of $1,800,000.\n\nHall of Justice, corner of Centre and Leonard streets, is a remarkable structure, composed of granite. It occupies an area in common with the City Prison, or Lock-up House, 253 by 200 feet, and is built in the Egyptian style. The Criminal Courts hold their sessions in this building, which, with its adjunct, the City Prison, are better known among the citizens as \"THE TOMBS.\"\n\nColumbia College, opposite Park Place, founded in 1754.\n\nNew-York University, situated opposite the east side of Washington Square, is a Gothic edifice 180 feet in front and 100 deep. It consists of a main building, with wings and towers at each corner. An immense window of stained glass decorates the front, and forms one of its most striking features. The Historical Society, with its library of 12,000 volumes, occupies rooms in the University buildings.\n\nNext to this is the beautiful Gothic Church, occupied by a congregation of the Dutch Reformed denomination, in charge of the Rev. Mr. Hutton.\n\nAmong the multitude of churches (upwards of 170) distributed through the city, the following deserve special notice from their architectural beauty: Trinity Church, in Broadway, opposite Wall st.; a magnificent Gothic structure\u2014St. Paul's, corner of Broadway and Fulton street\u2014Dutch Reformed, near the University\u2014St. John's Chapel, opposite St. John's Park\u2014St. Patrick's Cathedral\u2014Church of the Messiah\u2014Church of the Ascension\u2014French Protestant Church, Broome street\u2014Baptist Church\u2014St. Luke's Church, Hudson street\u2014St. Peter's, Barclay street\u2014St. Thomas\nChurch, a gothic church, corner of Houston-street and Broadway\u2014Unitarian Church, Mercer-street.\n\nThere are some rural Cemeteries in and near the city. That of Greenwood, in Brooklyn, is distinguished for the beauty of its scenery and the taste displayed in the arrangement of its numerous avenues.\n\nThe principal Benevolent Institutions are:\n\nNew York Hospital, in Broadway\u2014Alms-house and House of Refuge, at Bellevue\u2014Asylum for the Insane Poor, on Blackwell's Island\u2014Lunatic Asylum and Orphans' Asylum, at Bloomingdale, 5 miles north of the city\u2014Marine Hospital\u2014Seaman's Retreat and Sailors' Snug Harbor, on Staten Island\u2014U. S. Naval Hospital, Brooklyn\u2014Institution for the Blind, 8th avenue\u2014Institution for the Deaf and Dumb, 50th street, 3 miles from the City Hall\u2014Orphans' Asylum, in 12th street\u2014Roman Catholic Orphans' Asylum, Prince-street\u2014New-York Dispensary and the Northern Dispensary, supply the indigent with medicines and medical advice gratuitously\u2014Long Island Farms, a branch of the Alms-house, established for the instruction and maintenance of pauper children. Besides these there are several Benevolent Societies, for the relief of distressed foreigners of every description; Bible and Tract Societies; Missionary, Sunday School, and Education Associations, &c., &c.\n\nPlaces of Amusement.\u2014In addition to six regular Theatres, in various parts of the city, there are several Public Gardens, where musical and dramatic entertainments are occasionally given: Niblo's, Vauxhall, and Castle Gardens are the principal.\n\nBy the aid of the omnibuses, hacks, and cabs, which may be found at any moment, a stranger may be conveyed to any part of the city or adjoining villages at a small expense. Passage to any part of the state, and indeed to any part of the world, is afforded almost daily, by the innumerable railroads, stages, steamboats, or sailing vessels, which are constantly departing from the city in every direction.\nENVIRONS OF NEW-YORK.\n\nThe principal place in the vicinity of New York is Brooklyn, finely situated on Long Island, opposite the S. E. side of the city.\n\nIt is an incorporated city of King's county, with 36,283 inhabitants. The streets, with some exceptions, intersect each other at right angles, and are generally wide and well paved.\n\nIts commanding situation, salubrious atmosphere, and commodious buildings, have induced a vast number of persons doing business in New York to locate themselves here. The means of communication afforded by steam ferry-boats, which are constantly plying between the two cities, and scarcely ever take more than four minutes in crossing, make it more convenient to many persons to reside at Brooklyn than in the upper parts of the city. Hence, the rapid increase of Brooklyn; which, in 1810, contained only 4,402 inhabitants. Besides the usual county buildings there are, within the corporate limits of Brooklyn, 32 Churches, belonging to various denominations, 3 Banks, 3 Insurance Companies, a Lyceum, a handsome structure of granite; City Library and Reading-room, and some other Literary Institutions. The U. S. have a Navy Yard on Wallabout Bay, in the eastern part of the city, to which a Naval Lyceum is attached. The Naval Hospital stands a few hundred yards E. from the yard. Greenwood Cemetery, of which we have before spoken, is situated in the southern quarter, and Colonade Garden on the heights.\n\nOn the \"Heights of Brooklyn,\" near which the Americans were defeated with immense loss on the 27th August, 1776, may yet be seen the vestiges of military works constructed in the early stages of the American Revolution.\n\nThe remains of 11,000 Americans, who perished on board the British prison ships during the contest, now repose beneath the banks of the Wallabout.\n\nWilliamsburg.\u2014A recently built town, situated on the East river, N. E. of Brooklyn, and opposite\nthe S. E. part of New York, with which it has frequent communication, by means of several steam ferry-boats. Population by the census of 1840, 5,094. Its chief buildings are, a town hall, 7 churches, and the usual proportion of factories and work-shops, together with some handsome and tasty private dwellings.\n\nAstoria.\u2014A flourishing village of Queen's County, 6 miles N. E. from New-York. It has a population of about 750; 4 churches, an academy, several thriving factories, and an extensive botanic garden. It occupies a beautiful position on Long Island sound, near that remarkable whirlpool, called by the Dutch, Helle Gat, \"Hell Gate,\" and by the more refined, \"Hurl Gate.\" Astoria is one of the favorite summer residences of the New Yorkers.\n\nMiddletown.\u2014A small village of Long Island, consisting of 15 or 20 buildings; situated 3 miles S. E. from Astoria.\n\nNewtown.\u2014A clever little town of Queen's county, 5 miles E. N. E. from Williamsburg; containing 500 or 600 inhabitants, 4 churches, and the usual proportion of taverns, stores, and factories.\n\nFlushing.\u2014An incorporated town of Long Island, situated on Flushing bay, an arm of Long Island sound. Population about 2,000. This is the seat of several literary institutions, as St. Paul's College, St. Thomas' Hall, St. Ann's Hall, &c. The Linnaean Botanic Garden is here. These, and other advantages, render Flushing one of the most attractive places of resort on the island. It is about 10 miles distant from New York.\n\nJamaica.\u2014A large and well built town of Queen's county, 11 miles from Brooklyn, with a population, according to the late census, of 1650. Its chief buildings, besides those of the county, are 5 churches, 1 academy, 8 hotels and taverns, and several manufactories of pianos and carriages, 2 printing offices, &c. The Long Island Railroad Company have a large\ndep\u00f4t and machine shop here. Constant communication with Brooklyn, Flushing, Hempstead, Rockaway, &c., is afforded by the railroad or stages, which ply in all directions. Jamaica Bay, 5 miles S. from the town, abounds in wild fowl, oysters, clams, &c.\n\nRockaway Beach.\u2014A celebrated watering place, on the shore of the Atlantic Ocean, 22 miles S. E. from New-York.\n\nThere are, in addition to the \"Marine Pavilion\" and \"Rock Hall,\" both well kept, several private establishments; where, with less parade and show of style, the invalid may enjoy the refreshing sea air and bath in their utmost perfection, and at a moderate expense; whilst those who inhabit the former are expected, and expect, to pay liberally for their extravagant accommodations.\n\nBedford.\u2014A small village of King's county, 2 miles E. from Brooklyn,\n\nFlatbush.\u2014A neat village of King's county, 4 miles S. E. from Brooklyn; containing an academy, 2 churches, and about 450 inhabitants. Near this village, in August, 1776, was fought the disastrous and memorable battle of Long Island, between the American and British forces.\n\nNew Utrecht.\u2014A small village, situated about 1 mile from the shore of the Atlantic, and 7 miles of Brooklyn. It contains some 35 buildings, workshops, and about 200 inhabitants. About one mile South from New Utrecht is Bath; situated on the verge of the ocean, which is much frequented during the summer months for sea bathing. It consists of little else than the Hotel and its appendages.\n\nGravesend.\u2014A village situated 2 miles S. E. of Bath and 8 from Brooklyn.\n\nConey Island.\u2014Also a bathing place of great resort, forms a part of Gravesend township.\n\nFort Hamilton.\u2014This fortress, which, in connection with forts Lafayette and Tompkins, commands the Narrows, is situated on the western end of Long\nIsland, and about 8 miles nearly due South from New York. A small assemblage of houses has grown up around it, including 1 church and an extensive boarding house. It has recently become a place of fashionable resort, chiefly for the convenience of sea bathing.\n\nNew Brighton.\u2014A village of country seats, erected for the accommodation of some of the \"best society\" of New-York. It occupies the most northern point of Staten Island, at the entrance of the \"Kills,\" which separate the island from the Jersey shore. The town plot, which for the most part is the result of expensive excavation, descends rapidly from the base of the adjoining hills, and the buildings range in a line with, and at nearly an equal distance from, the margin of New-York bay. The situation is very fine, commanding a view of the bay, with its islets, the city, Long Island, &c. The houses, with their white fronts and massive columns, present a beautiful appearance from the water. There are 2 extensive hotels and several boarding houses. Population about 400. A short distance to the West stands the Sailors' Snug Harbor; a sort of Greenwich Hospital, or Asylum for superannuated mariners. It consists of a large building, with wings, so arranged as to accommodate a large number of inmates. Two miles east of Brighton lies the Quarantine Ground, the Marine Hospital, and Tompkinsville. The latter is a large town, containing upwards of 1,400 inhabitants, 3 churches, several hotels, and beautifully situated on the high ground in the rear of Fort Tompkins. Attached to the Quarantine establishment are, the Marine Hospital, for the reception of patients afflicted with contagious diseases; a Yellow Fever Hospital; a Small Pox Hospital; besides several other buildings, for the Physician, Health Officers, and others.\n\nSteamboats leave the lower part of the city every hour during the day for New Brighton, the Quarantine Ground, and Tompkinsville.\nJersey City.\u2014On the West side of the Hudson, opposite New York, is situated on a point or cape, formerly called Paulus Hook. The city is regularly laid out, with the streets, which are generally wide, crossing each other at right angles. The public buildings are, 4 churches, a lyceum, academy, high school, a bank, a pottery, glass factory, and about 300 private dwellings. Population, 3,072. The New Jersey Railroad Company have an extensive depot here; and the Morris Canal, from Bordentown, intersects the Hudson in the lower part of the city.\n\nHarsimus is a small village, directly in the rear of Jersey City, containing 125 inhabitants. And still farther North is Pavonia, another suburb of Jersey City, containing some 250 inhabitants.\n\nBergen.\u2014Seat of Justice for Hudson county, New Jersey, is finely situated on Bergen Hill, 2 miles West of Jersey City. It contains 2 churches, a court-house and other county buildings, with 300 inhabitants. Bergen, until recently, presented the appearance of one of the Dutch villages of early times. The primitive manners, customs, and dress of the people, and their mode of building, have been rigidly maintained by a remnant of the inhabitants; but, since the little Dutch village became the capital of a county, a spirit of improvement has been awakened among them.\n\nHoboken.\u2014A new village of Hudson county, New Jersey, containing about 200 inhabitants, an Episcopal church, and several public houses. Hoboken is much frequented by the citizens of New-York. The \"Elysian Fields,\" so called, contain some beautiful walks. A fine view of the city may be had from the high grounds of Hoboken. Hoboken has recently acquired additional notoriety, as the scene of a most shocking tragedy, in which a young girl, Miss Rogers, was murdered by some unknown hand. The village of West Hoboken, situated on the summit of Bergen Hill, commands a fine view of the city and harbor.\nWeehawken.\u2014A small settlement on the Jersey shore, consisting of some 20 or 30 buildings; beautifully situated, about 2 miles North of Hoboken, on an elevated bluff of the Hudson.\n\nBloomingdale.\u2014A remarkably neat village of New York county, situated on the left bank of the Hudson, 5 miles above the City Hall. An Orphan's Asylum is established here. The village consists chiefly of country seats, and contains some 400 inhabitants. About 2 miles beyond Bloomingdale, on the same side of the river, is\n\nManhattanville.\u2014Containing about 500 inhabitants, an Episcopal church, and some extensive factories. The New York Lunatic Asylum occupies a commanding position in the southern part of the village.\n\nHarlem is situated 2 miles S. E. of Manhattanville, on Harlem river, near its discharge into Long Island sound. It is a flourishing village, with a population of 1,500, 4 churches, and a superabundance of \"hotels,\" besides a commodious depot belonging to the New York and Harlem Railroad Company, and several factories. The cars for Harlem start every hour from the depot, N. E. of the City Hall.\n\nROUTES FROM THE CITY OF NEW-YORK.\n\nTo Philadelphia, via S. Amboy and Bordentown.\n\n* * Places marked thus \u2020 are described in other parts of the work.\n\n| Steamboat | Railroad |\n|-----------|----------|\n| Castle William,... | 1 | Spotswood, .......... | 9 38 |\n| Bedlow's Island,... | 1 2 | Hightstown, ....... | 13 51 |\n| New Brighton,... | 5 7 | Bordentown,........ | 13 64 |\n| Elizabethport,... | 5 12 | Burlington,......... | 10 74 |\n| Perth Amboy,... | 15 27 | Philadelphia,....... | 20 94 |\n| South Amboy,... | 2 29 |\nCastle William, a strong fortress belonging to the United States, situated on the West side of Governor's Island, and constituting one of the principal defences of the city and harbor of New York. It was erected previously to the late war with Great Britain; it is now garrisoned and well supplied with ordnance of great power.\n\nRobin's Reef.\u2014A ledge of rocks in New-York Bay, upon which a lighthouse has been erected; which, with Bedlow's Island, also belongs to the United States. It is surmounted by a small military work, called Fort Wood, designed to co-operate with Castle Williams in the defence of the city.\n\nNew Brighton.*\n\nElizabethport.\u2014A very neat and flourishing village of New Jersey, which has recently started into notice; being at the eastern terminus of the Elizabethport and Somerville Railroad, now in operation. Its site was, until lately, known as Elizabethtown Point, and was the landing place for Elizabethtown, which is situated a few miles in the interior. Population about 600.\n\nPerth Amboy.\u2014A city and port of entry of Middlesex county, New Jersey, at the confluence of Raritan river and Staten Island sound. Population 1,303. It derives its name in part from James, Earl of Perth, one of the original proprietors of the ground; which was laid off into town lots in 1683, and incorporated in 1784. A large portion of the buildings are elevated forty or fifty feet above the adjacent bay.\n\nThe Brighton House, a large hotel, erected here several years since, forms a striking object of attention. Like many other \"experiments,\" the hotel failed to realise the expectations of its proprietors; and it is now occupied; during the summer months, by a wealthy family of New York.\n\nSouth Amboy is a mere landing place, where the Camden and Amboy railroad terminates. Here the\npassengers for Philadelphia quit the steamboat and enter the cars.\n\nSpotswood.\u2014A neat village of Middlesex County, containing about 150 inhabitants, 2 churches, and the usual factories, shops, &c.\n\nHightstown.\u2014A thriving village; which, since the completion of the Camden and Amboy railroad, has become a place of considerable note. The village is rapidly improving, by the erection of many neat and substantial buildings, which now amount to more than one hundred, with about 700 inhabitants.\n\nBordentown.\u2014A town in Burlington county, New Jersey, containing about 1,700 inhabitants. The town is situated on a high bank; which, while it gives it a commanding position, serves to obstruct its view from the river. The Delaware and Raritan Canal has its western termination here.\n\nJoseph Buonaparte, many years since, selected Bordentown as a place of residence, where he continued for some years. The buildings and grounds are among the most conspicuous objects of the place.\n\nBurlington.\u2014A city of New Jersey, situated on the left bank of the Delaware, containing 3,434 inhabitants. Among the buildings are, six places of worship, a city hall, a lyceum, bank, several extensive boarding-schools, &c. The town is regularly laid out, with streets crossing each other at right angles. They are mostly well built; some with side and front lots, which serve to beautify the town and give it a neat and airy appearance. The \"bank,\" which is chiefly occupied by country seats belonging to Philadelphians, consists of a beautiful grassy plane, with a gentle inclination towards the river. Here is the residence of Bishop Doane, a Gothic structure, surmounted by a cross, and resembles one of the Catholic Missionary stations of former times. (For a full description of Philadelphia, see Tanner's Central Traveler.)\nFrom New-York to Philadelphia, via New-Brunswick and Trenton, by Railroad.\n\n| Jersey City | 1 |\n|-------------|---|\n| Newark      | 8 |\n| Elizabethtown | 5 |\n| Rahway     | 5 |\n| Matouchin   | 9 |\n| New Brunswick | 4 |\n| Princeton   | 17 |\n| Trenton     | 10 |\n| Bordentown  | 5 |\n| Philadelphia | 30 |\n\nJersey City\n\nNewark \u2014 This is by far the largest, and as a manufacturing place, the most important town, or rather city, for it is organized as such, in the State of New Jersey. Its population, according to the census of 1840, is 17,292, a large portion of which is engaged in the various manufactories, which abound here to an unusual extent. Newark was first settled in 1666, by people from New England. It is the seat of justice of Essex county, and may now be regarded as the metropolis of the state.\n\nThe Passaic, here a beautiful stream, flows along the eastern side of the town, and gradually curves towards the east, in its passage into Newark bay, three miles distant from the city. The town plot, except in the immediate vicinity of the Passaic, is elevated some thirty or forty feet above the river; and the country, on the west, continues to rise for a few miles, and then descends in the direction of Elizabethtown. Its streets and avenues are wide, and shaded by an abundance of trees, which add greatly to the beauty of the city and to the comfort of passengers. The city is supplied with water from a copious spring, a short distance from the town. The commercial facilities of Newark have been greatly augmented of late, by the completion of the Morris Canal, and the various railroads which now pass through the city. These, superadded to the almost innumerable manufacturing establishments in and\nabout the place, give it an active and business-like appearance, gratifying alike to those who are practically engaged in them, and to those who witness their operations.\n\nAmong the articles manufactured here, most of which are sent to distant markets, may be mentioned, leather, saddlery and harness, carriages and carriage furniture, hats, boots and shoes, in immense quantities, brass and iron castings, soap and candles, tin and sheet-iron ware, clothing of all sorts, Venetian blinds, cabinet furniture, jewelry, clocks, tools and agricultural implements, ropes and cordage, malt liquors, pottery, together with a host of other matters, \"too numerous to mention.\"\n\nBesides the factories, most of which are on a large scale, there are several breweries, grist and saw mills, dyeing houses, and printing offices, each of which issues a newspaper, &c. There are schools innumerable, academies, and several literary and scientific institutions. Of churches, the Episcopalians have two; the Presbyterians five; the Baptists two; the Dutch Reformed one; the Methodists three; and the Roman Catholics one. The other public buildings are the court house, county offices, three banks, and the immense depot of the New Jersey Railroad Company.\n\nSituated in the immediate neighborhood of the hostile armies, the people of Newark were kept in a constant state of alarm during the revolutionary struggle. On one occasion the British sent from New-York a detachment consisting of five hundred men, who burnt the academy and committed other excesses. They were, however, induced to quit the town before they could accomplish the destruction of the place, which, no doubt, was their object.\n\nElizabethtown.\u2014A beautiful town, situated on Elizabeth creek, in Essex county, containing about five hundred buildings and 3,000 inhabitants. It is a borough town, and one of the oldest in the state, its\nNEW-YORK TO PHILADELPHIA.\n\nsite having been purchased from the Indians by a company from Long Island, so early as the year 1664. Owing to its contiguity to New-York, the quiet of Elizabethtown was frequently disturbed by the contending parties during the revolutionary war. In one of these conflicts, a resident clergyman of the Presbyterian church was killed, after witnessing the destruction of his church, which was burnt by the British. There is in this town an unusual proportion of handsome dwellings and churches; which, with the wide and regular streets, impart an air of great neatness and beauty to the place, and render it a very desirable residence.\n\nThe Elizabethport and Somerville railroad, as well as that from Jersey City to New Brunswick, pass through the town. These, with turnpikes and several good common roads, afford extensive facilities for conveying to market the agricultural products and manufactures of the town and adjacent country.\n\nAmong the latter may be mentioned, oil-cloth, earthenware, ropes and cordage, cotton bagging, tin and sheet-iron ware, clocks, carriages, leather, iron castings, steam engines, and machinery of all kinds. The place is also provided with several literary, scientific, and benevolent institutes, which afford to the inhabitants the means of intellectual enjoyment and moral culture, amid the busy scenes of their daily occupation.\n\nWith all these advantages, it is scarcely necessary for us to add that Elizabethtown is a flourishing place.\n\nRahway.\u2014A large and thriving town of Middlesex county, formed by the union of several villages. One of these was formerly called \"Bridgetown;\" but as there was another Bridgetown in the state, the legislature, by special enactment, united the whole, under the name of Rahway, after the river upon whose banks they are situated; by which\nname they are now generally known. Their united population is 2,533, originally from New England. The Presbyterians, Methodists, Baptists and Friends have places of worship here. That of the Presbyterians is a beautiful structure. Among the liberal institutions of the place, which possesses many, there are a public library, an \"Athen\u00e6an Academy,\" so called, a fine building, erected by a company expressly for the institution, which partakes, in some measure, of the nature of a high school. There are, also, Sunday schools attached to most of the churches; six or eight well conducted public schools, a bank, a printing office, from which a weekly newspaper is issued. If the people of Rahway have been thus liberal in providing means for the moral and intellectual improvement of their youth, they have been no less so in the erection and embellishment of their dwellings, which present a remarkably neat appearance. Rahway may be, with truth, styled a manufacturing place. Establishments on an extensive scale are in daily operation here. The manufactures consist of silk printing, carriages and carriage furniture, hats, shoes, clothing, clocks, earthenware, and cotton goods.\n\nMatouchin.\u2014A mere hamlet of Middlesex county, containing about twenty buildings. It is, however, situated in the centre of a populous and fertile country; which, from the numerous buildings, may be regarded as an extended village.\n\nNew Brunswick.\u2014This place is situated in the counties of Somerset and Middlesex, and is the seat of justice of the latter. It is an incorporated city, and next to Newark the largest town in the state. It is situated on the right bank of the Raritan, about twelve miles above Amboy bay. Its population is 8,693, and the number of buildings is about twelve hundred. The public buildings, &c., consist of the courthouse and its appendages, college edifice (Rutgers' College) and grammar school, an Episcopal\nNEW-YORK TO PHILADELPHIA.\n\nTheir united church, a Presbyterian church, a Baptist church, Catholic chapel, two Methodist churches, one Dutch Reformed church, two academies, some incorporated schools, several common schools, and two banks. In addition to the splendid viaduct of the New Jersey Railroad, there is a fine wooden bridge across the Raritan, one thousand feet long, with double ways. The Delaware and Raritan Canal terminates, and the New Jersey Railroad and that to Trenton unite here. These railroads form an important link in the great north and south line, which will, ere long, extend without interruption, from Portsmouth, in New Hampshire, to New Orleans, Pensacola, &c. Some of the buildings have an antiquated appearance, having been erected on the first settlement of the place, in 1713, which was then called \"Prigmore's swamp.\" Those built by the Dutch colony, which emigrated from Albany, though of a more recent date, are no less remarkable, not only in their peculiar construction, but also from their position, having their gable ends fronting on the streets. Albany may be readily distinguished by its characteristic lines. Constant communication between New Brunswick and the city of New York is afforded by several steamboats, railroads, and turnpikes. There are also excellent turnpike and common roads leading in every direction, by which the city of New Brunswick enjoys considerable commerce; not only in the agricultural products of the contiguous country, but also in the manufactures of its numerous workshops.\n\nPrinceton.\u2014This attractive little town has been long celebrated as the seat of Nassau Hall, one of the oldest and most respectable colleges in the country. It contains also a theological seminary, established some years since, by the Presbyterians. Both institutions are in a flourishing condition, and are successfully prosecuting the objects which they have in view.\nPrinceton, by the new arrangement of counties, is embraced within the limits of Mercer county, and lies a small distance to the north of the railroad to New Brunswick. Its position is considered one of the most salubrious in the state, being considerably elevated above the surrounding country, and of course is free from those exhalations common to low lands. Princeton is an incorporated town, and contains about three hundred and thirty buildings, with 3,055 inhabitants, including the inmates of both colleges. There are five places of public worship, and several schools of a high order, for both males and females. Whether we regard the position of the town, its neat and attractive dwellings, or the general intelligence of its inhabitants, we know not a more desirable place of residence than Princeton.\n\nOne of the most important incidents of the revolution occurred in the neighborhood of this town. On the night of January 3d, 1777, the American and British armies lay encamped on opposite banks of the Assanpink creek, near Trenton. The British commander, confident of success in the coming conflict, only awaited the approach of day to begin the work of destruction. In this critical situation, and menaced by a force every way superior to his own, Washington determined to abandon his position on the Assanpink, and by a circuitous march along the left flank of the enemy, fall into their rear at Princeton. When it was dark the army, leaving its fires lighted, and the sentinels on the margin of the creek, decamped with perfect secrecy. About sunrise, two British regiments, that were on their march to join the rear of the British army at Lawrence, fell in with the van of the Americans, conducted by General Mercer, and a very sharp action ensued. The advanced party of Americans, composed chiefly of militia, soon gave way, and the few regulars attached to them could not maintain their ground. General Mercer, while gallantly exerting himself to rally his\nbroken troops, received a mortal wound. General Washington, however, who followed close in their rear, now led on the main body of the army, and attacked the enemy with great spirit. While he exposed himself to their hottest fire, he was so well supported by the same troops which had aided him a few days before in the victory at Trenton, that the British were compelled to give way, and Washington pressed forward to Princeton. A party of the British, that had taken refuge in the college, after receiving a few discharges from the American field-pieces, surrendered themselves prisoners of war; but the principal part of the regiment that was left there saved itself by a precipitate retreat to Brunswick. In this action upwards of a hundred of the British were killed and nearly three hundred were taken prisoners. Great was the surprise of Lord Cornwallis when the report of the artillery at Princeton, and the arrival of breathless messengers, apprised him that the enemy was in the rear. Alarmed by the danger of his position, he commenced a retreat; and being harassed by the militia and the country people, who had suffered by the outrages perpetrated by his troops on their advance, he did not deem himself in safety until he arrived at Brunswick; from whence, by means of the Raritan, he had communication with New York.\n\nTrenton.\u2014The capital of the State of New Jersey, is situated on the left or east bank of the Delaware, in Mercer county, of which it is the seat of justice, twenty-eight miles north-east from Philadelphia, and fifty-nine south-west of New York. Its site is immediately upon the mouth of the Assanpink, near the lower falls of the Delaware. It is approached from the Pennsylvania side by a fine bridge of five arches, supported by stone piers and abutments. There are now about 1,000 buildings of every sort, and 4,035 inhabitants. The place was incorporated as a city on the 13th November, 1792. Its public buildings, and other objects of curiosity, consist of the State\nHouse or Legislative Hall, Governor's House, County Offices, State Prison, and City Hall.\n\nIn addition to the above, there are in and about Trenton, several beautiful churches, two banking houses, an academy, many boarding-schools, a vast number of common schools, and other institutions of a public nature; together with the usual complement of stores, taverns, manufactories, cotton mills, printing offices, some of which issue weekly journals; several literary and scientific institutions, and in short, all other components that constitute a little city such as Trenton.\n\nAmong the leading avenues of trade possessed by Trenton, those by the canals and railroads are the most important. The Delaware and Raritan Canal, from Bordentown to New Brunswick, and its navigable feeder, pass through Trenton; whence railroads extend to Philadelphia and New Brunswick; and another, which intersects the Camden and Amboy railroad, a short distance from Bordentown.\n\nThe manufacturing facilities of the city have, of late, been materially improved. A company, incorporated in 1831, has just completed a short canal and mill-race on the bank of the river, by which a valuable water power is afforded, and now extensively and profitably employed.\n\nThe name of Trenton occupies a prominent place in the annals of our revolution. It was here, in 1776, that General Washington, with five thousand five hundred men, after crossing the Delaware, amid all the dangers of an inclement night, attacked the British forces, under Colonel Rahl, who was mortally wounded by the first fire. His men, in the utmost dismay, attempted to file off towards Princeton; but General Washington perceiving their intention, moved a portion of his troops into the road in front, and thus frustrated their design.\n\nTheir artillery having been seized, and the Americans pressing upon them, they surrendered. Many\nof the Hessians were killed\u2014a thousand were made prisoners\u2014while a few escaped and fled in the direction of Bordentown. Of the American troops only two were killed and two frozen to death. Washington, soon after this brilliant affair, re-crossed the Delaware with his prisoners, six pieces of artillery, a thousand stand of arms, and some military stores.\n\nBristol.\u2014A beautiful village, situated on the west bank of the Delaware, nearly opposite to Burlington. Its high and commanding position early attracted the attention of the first settler; and a town, called Buckingham, was laid off, and subsequently incorporated by Sir William Kieth, in 1720, under the name of Bristol.\n\nAmong the numerous attractions of this beautiful spot are two mineral springs, at which buildings, for the accommodation of visitors, were erected some years since, and dignified by the name of Bath. Bristol contains at present about two hundred and fifty dwellings, with 1,734 inhabitants, a bank, several places of worship, a masonic lodge, &c.\n\nThe houses, especially those on the immediate bank of the river, present a remarkably neat and handsome appearance. The Delaware division of the Pennsylvania Canal terminates here, in a spacious basin, which communicates with the Delaware river. This canal, with the Lehigh Company's Canal, forms an uninterrupted water communication with the anthracite coal region of Northampton county.\n\nBordentown.\u2020\n\nFrom New-York to Easton, Pa., via Morrisville and Schooley's Mountain Springs.\n\n| Location          | Distance |\n|-------------------|----------|\n| Newark            | 10       |\n| Morristown        | 20       |\n| Mendham           | 7        |\n| Chester           | 5        |\n\nTotal distance: 42 miles\nGerman Valley, by stage, ............5 47\nSchooley's M.

It is beautifully situated on an elevated plain, which rises gradually from the river bank.\n\nMost of the public buildings, and some of the best dwellings, face an open square in the centre of the town. There are, besides the buildings devoted to county purposes, several handsome churches, an academy, and a due proportion of stores, manufactories, workshops, and taverns; grist, paper and saw mills. There are also printing offices, from which weekly journals are issued; Sunday schools, a bible society, a temperance society, and several institutions of a like description. With but few exceptions, the houses are well built; each is surrounded by cultivated gardens, which impart to the place an air of much rural beauty. By means of pipes laid in the streets, most of the water used in the town is brought from a never-failing spring, about two miles distant. The Morris and Essex railroad, twenty miles in length, from Newark, terminates here. Population 4,013.\n\nMendham.\u2014A village of Morris county, containing a Presbyterian church, a boarding-school, several stores, mills, and about sixty dwellings. Population 1,378.\n\nChester.\u2014A village of Morris county, containing forty or fifty buildings, including two churches, which extends for nearly a mile along the road from Easton to Morrisville. Population 1,321.\n\nGerman Valley, a small settlement in Morris county, on the south branch of the Raritan.\nSchooley's Mountain Springs.\u2014A celebrated place of resort of invalids and others, in search of health or pleasure. The water of these springs, which are situated in a small depression of Musconicong mountain, in Morris county, N.J., is chalybeate, is strongly marked by the usual ferruginous impregnations, and the other characteristics of such springs. They are used to great advantage in chronic cases and general debility. Independent of the benefit to be derived from the use of the waters, the great elevation of the springs (nearly 1,100 feet,) produces an agreeable temperature, which braces and invigorates the frame. The accommodations here are in no way inferior to other establishments of the kind elsewhere. There are three extensive hotels, besides several private boarding houses, which afford to visitors the opportunity of selecting the location most congenial to their wishes.\n\nMansfield.\u2014A pretty little village of forty or fifty buildings in Warren county, New Jersey. It is supplied with water by means of pipes, which conduct it to several fountains in the village.\n\nEaston.\u2014This is by far the largest and most important town in this section of the state, and is the seat of justice of Northampton county. It was incorporated as a borough in September, 1789, and now contains a population of 5,510. The town is situated on a point of land formed by the Delaware and Lehigh rivers and the Bushkill creek. The streets are laid out at right angles to each other, and along the cardinal points. The lower part of the town, near the Delaware, is on an elevated level, but the western extremity rises by a gradual acclivity, to a considerable elevation.\n\nThere are within the boundaries of the borough, three oil mills, six grist mills, two saw mills, two distilleries, three tan-yards and tanneries, one brewery, and thirty-one dry-goods and hardware stores. A library formed in 1811, containing about four thou-\nsand volumes. A mineralogical cabinet. A college called the Lafayette College, in which the learned languages, &c., are taught. Several places of public worship. A court-house, erected 1758. Four fine bridges; one over the Delaware, a most substantial structure, erected at an expense of $80,000; one, a chain bridge, over the Lehigh, on the Philadelphia road; and two over the Bushkill. There are two banks,\u2014one the Easton Bank, with a capital of $40,000.\n\nFrom New-York to Passaic Falls, by railroad.\n\n| Location          | Miles |\n|-------------------|-------|\n| Jersey City       | 1     |\n| Bergen            | 2 3   |\n| Acquackanonk      | 9 12  |\n| Paterson and the Falls | 5 17 |\n\nJersey City.\n\nBergen.\n\nAcquackanonk.\u2014A village of Passaic county, situated on the right bank of the Passaic, 12 miles N. W. from New-York. It contains two places of worship, one cotton factory and about 450 inhabitants, who are chiefly engaged in manufacturing.\n\nPassaic Falls.\u2014This is a beautiful sheet of water, which presents an unbroken fall of fifty feet. It is situated at the town of Paterson, on the Passaic river, whose banks here are nearly vertical. The water in its passage, through the lapse of ages, has worn a deep chasm in the solid rock, which is obviously retreating, as the abraded banks below testify. No spectacle can be more imposing than is presented by the falling liquid, as it glides gently over the brow of the precipice. The town of Paterson is admirably situated for manufacturing purposes at the falls, which afford a constant and abundant supply of water for the vast number of factories in operation in the town,\nwhich is now one of the most important manufacturing places in the United States. The number of buildings at present in Paterson and New Manchester, an adjoining village, is upwards of one thousand, and that of the inhabitants, 7,598. Here are Presbyterians, both of the old and new schools; Dutch Reformed, Roman Catholics, Episcopalians, Baptists, Methodists, Seceders, Lutherans, Friends, Universalists, Unitarians, &c. There are in the town a society for the promotion of literature and science, which has an excellent library, a Mechanics' Institute, a Museum, a Circulating Library, a Public Library, and some other institutions of a similar description.\n\nRoute up the Hudson, to Albany, by steam-boat.\n\n| Towns on the West bank | Towns, &c. on the East bank |\n|------------------------|----------------------------|\n| Hoboken                | 1 Bloomingdale             |\n| Weehawk                | 2 Manhattanville           |\n| Bull's Ferry           | 3 Spuyten Duyvel            |\n| Fort Lee               | 4 Yonkers                  |\n| Piermont               | 10 Hastings                |\n| Nyack                  | 24 Dobbs' Ferry            |\n| Warren                 | 29 Tarrytown               |\n| Stony Point            | 36 Sing Sing               |\n| Caldwell's Landing     | 41 Teller's Point          |\n| Fort Clinton           | 44 Croton                  |\n| Fort Montgomery        | 48 Verplanck City          |\n| Bare Mount             | Peekskill                  |\n| Fort Putnam            | Anthony's Nose Mt          |\n| West Point             | Sugar-loaf Mt              |\n| Crows'-nest Mt         | Cold Spring                |\n| Butter Hill            | Bull Mt                    |\n| New Windsor            | Break-neck Mt              |\n| Newburg                | Fishkill Land'g            |\n| Marlboro               | or Martinsville            |\n| Milton                 | Hamburg                    |\nRoute from\n\nTowns on the West bank.

A large body of American militia stationed here, in attempting to retreat, were overpowered by a vastly superior force, consisting chiefly of Hessians, when they were either slain or consigned to the prison ships, a fate more terrific than death itself. The site of Fort Lee is upwards of 300 above the water. A hotel at the landing is much frequented. A few miles below Fort Lee, commences the Palisades, a lofty basaltic wall, which extends for twenty miles up the west bank of the Hudson. They are nearly vertical, and range from 200 to 500 feet in height. The columns, which are divided into segments, admirably fitted to each other, are altogether\nof a coarser texture than most other similar formations, though, in some parts, the angles are equally perfect and well defined.\n\nSpuyten Duyvil Creek.\u2014An inconsiderable opening on the east side of the Hudson, which, with Harlem river, separates the island of New York from the main land of Westchester county.\n\nKingsbridge.\u2014A sort of rialto among the New Yorkers, crosses the strait a short distance from the Hudson.\n\nYonkers.\u2014A pleasant village of Westchester county, situated at the outlet of Saw-mill creek. It is built mostly on the river bank, which, being somewhat elevated, commands a fine view of the river and the palisades opposite. Besides the two churches, an academy and several taverns and store houses, there are upwards of 75 dwellings, and a population of about 500.\n\nHastings.\u2014A small village and landing, of the same county, consisting of 15 or 20 buildings of various sorts, including one hotel, a button factory, &c.\n\nDobbs' Ferry is a small settlement and public landing in Westchester county, with a ferry to the opposite side of the Hudson.\n\nPiermont, formerly Tappan Sloat.\u2014This village having been selected for the eastern terminus of the N. York and Erie rail-road, the secluded little Dutch settlement of the \"Sloat,\" which had reposed in peace and quietness for a century or more, has received the classic soubriquet of \"Piermont,\" and is now an important town of Rockland county. Such has been the effect of this movement upon the unsophisticated village, that its site is now covered by handsome public and private edifices, which form a striking contrast with the little Dutch houses of its primitive inhabitants.\n\nThere are in the town upwards of 150 buildings, including two or three churches, and a population of about 1,100. A pier about one mile in length, which\nforms the commencement of the rail-road just mentioned, extends over the flats to a commodious dock, near the channel of the river. The New-York and Erie rail-road will, when completed, extend to Dunkirk, on the eastern shore of Lake Erie, a distance of 450 miles. It is now in use as far as Goshen, with which daily communication is had. The little village of Tappan, which is situated two miles west of Piermont, is well known as the place of execution of Major Andr\u00e9, whose remains were a few years since transferred to England, his native country. Two miles below Piermont, commences,\n\nTappan Sea.\u2014An expansion of the Hudson, about ten miles in length and four in breadth, having Tarrytown and Singsing on its east margin, and Piermont and Nyack on the west.\n\nTarrytown is a large and well built town, with about 1,100 inhabitants. This is the town in which Major Andr\u00e9 was taken by the \"Cow-boys,\" Paulding, Williams and Van Wart, after his conference with Arnold.\n\nSleepy Hollow is a little to the north of Tarrytown.\n\nNyack.\u2014A village of Rockland county, containing about 650 inhabitants, three or four churches, and the usual complement of taverns, shops, &c.\n\nSingsing.\u2014An incorporated town of Westchester county, situated in the N. E. angle of Tappan bay, near Teller's point. It was founded in 1796, and derives its name from the indian terms Ossin sing, (stony ground,) a most apposite name. Singsing being celebrated for its marble quarries, as the ground plot consists of a plain which declines rapidly as it approaches the river, nearly every building may be seen in passing. Besides the state prison near the water's edge, there are 4 churches, 6 public houses, one ship yard, one iron foundry, an academy, a handsome marble building, and about 350 dwellings, with about 2,500 inhabitants.\n\nThe State Prison, in the southern part of the town,\nNEW-YORK TO ALBANY.\n\nis an immense pile, resembling military barracks. The principal building, which is occupied exclusively by the men, is 480 feet long, 44 wide and 5 stories high, and contains 1,000 cells. The females are placed in another building, which stands upon the high ground in the rear.\n\nCroton river.\u2014From which the city of New-York is supplied with water, has its principal fountain in Dutchess county, and after a S.W. course of 45 miles, enters the Hudson a short distance above Singsing. It is a beautiful stream, whose waters are so pure and transparent, that its pebbly bottom may be seen at a considerable depth.\n\nThe Aqueduct, which conveys the water to the city, is a most splendid work, not surpassed in magnitude, by any similar structure of either ancient or modern times. Its transverse section in the clear is nine feet high, and seven and a half feet wide, its sides have an inclination of about 1 in 7, inward, from bottom to top. It is nearly 42 miles in length, extends from the great dam about seven miles up the stream, through Singsing, Yonkers, and over Harlem strait, by an immense bridge, to the distributing basin in the city.\n\nTeller's Point.\u2014A peninsula at the mouth of the Croton, which separates Tappan and Haverstraw bays.\n\nCroton or Callaburg Landing.\u2014A small village near Teller's point, containing about 70 inhabitants.\n\nWarren, or Haverstraw.\u2014A village of Rockland county, situated on the western recess of Haverstraw bay. Population about 450, with two churches, taverns, stores, &c.\n\nHaverstraw Bay.\u2014An expansion of the river, which is near about three miles in width and about seven in length. Between Teller's point on the east, and Vredidicker hook, a rocky eminence nearly 700 feet in height, on the west, it unites with Tappan sea by a strait about a mile and a half in width. At its\nnorth end the river resumes its usual width, which it maintains for a short distance.\n\nStony Point, a military post during the revolutionary war. This point will be ever memorable in the military history of the United States, as the scene of one of General Wayne's most brilliant achievements. On the 11th of July, 1779, after a silent march from West point, he suddenly attacked the post, then in the hands of the British troops, and after a spirited and bloody contest, succeeded in carrying the place without discharging a gun: the garrison surrendered at discretion. Being menaced by a vastly superior force, General Wayne on the following day withdrew his forces, after demolishing the works and securing the military stores.\n\nVerplanck's City, formerly called Verplanck's Point, occupies a commanding situation at the western extremity of the point. It was laid out a few years since into lots, but notwithstanding its eligible position, the city is still in its embryo state. There are about 30 buildings of every sort, and some 80 or 100 inhabitants. A short distance above Verplanck, commence the\n\nHighlands.\u2014Being that portion of a lofty chain of mountains which has been pierced by the Hudson, presenting to the eye of the beholder a scene of wild beauty and picturesque grandeur. The chain here, upwards of fifteen hundred feet high, has evidently been rent and torn asunder by the action of water, by which it is probable the now fertile region above may have been, in ages long past, submerged, until relieved by the disruption of the Highlands.\n\nIn some places the banks ascend the crest of the chain by easy step, more or less lofty; whilst in others it is reached by a continued succession of rugged chasms, abrupt precipices and huge masses of naked rock. The most noted summits are: Anthony's Nose, which shows itself immediately on leaving Caldwell's landing. The rocks near the apex, (1,128\nfeet above the river,) present a rude representation of a human countenance, when viewed from a certain point; Bare Mount, 1,350 feet; Crows' Nest, 1,410; Butter Hill, 1,529; Bull Head, 1,486; Breakneck Hill, 1,187; New Beacon, 1,685; Old Beacon, 1,471. They are mostly covered over to their very summits with dense forests, which add great beauty to the prospect.\n\nCaldwell's Landing \u2014 A small settlement at which most of the river steam-boats touch. Here is a ferry to\n\nPeekskill.\u2014An important and handsome town of Westchester county, containing about 1,800 inhabitants, eight churches, one bank, several extensive factories, iron foundries, one academy, &c. It was here that Palmer and Strang, British spies, were hung, by order of General Putnam, during the revolution.\n\nForts Montgomery and Clinton.\u2014Two of the principal defences during the revolutionary war, which on one occasion were attacked by a British force of 3,000 troops, and, with the garrison, consisting of 600 men, were captured on the 6th October, 1777.\n\nWest Point.\u2014The seat of the United States Military Academy, established in 1802, which occupies an extensive and beautiful plain, elevated about 175 feet above the surface of the Hudson. The buildings consist of an academy, built of stone, 275 feet long and 75 wide, in which are deposited the instruments, models and other apparatus; an observatory, 150 by 60 feet, surmounted by a dome; two barracks, a hospital, a chapel, &c.; a large hotel, and about 50 other buildings, mostly occupied by the professors and officers of the institute and their assistants. The entire population, including 250 cadets (the number authorized by law,) is about 800. Such are the numerous attractions of the place, that it is visited by a vast number of persons during the travelling season. Here resides Mr. R. W. Weir, author of the admirable picture of the \"Departure of the Pilgrims,\" one of the finest paintings in the capitol at Washington. In the early part of the revolutionary contest, West Point\nbecame an object of attention. At several points forts were erected, some of which are still to be seen Fort Putnam, situated on Mount Independence, about 600 feet above the plain, is the first object seen on approaching the point from the south. This spot and the adjacent country are memorable as the scene of Arnold's treachery.\n\nCold Spring.\u2014A busy and thriving town of Putnam county, containing about 200 buildings, including 5 churches, 4 public houses, one extensive iron foundry and machine shop, and some other factories. Population about 1,300.\n\nNew Windsor.\u2014A small town of Orange county, with 250 inhabitants, two churches, a boat yard, &c.\n\nNewburg.\u2014An important incorporated town of Orange county. It is pleasantly situated on a bank, which rises by a bold acclivity, and presents a fine appearance from the river.\n\nIn addition to the court-house and other county offices, there are upwards of 1,200 buildings including eleven churches, three banks, fourteen hotels, 160 stores, three flouring mills, three plaster mills, one brewery, one floor-cloth factory, factories of leather, ploughs, combs, tobacco, carriages, &c., &c. It has frequent communications with New-York and Albany by steamers, which ply constantly along the river, and with the opposite shore by steam ferry-boats. The courts for Orange county sit alternately here and at Goshen, about 20 miles inland. Immediately opposite Newburg is\n\nMartinsville or Fishkill Landing,\u2014Where an extensive settlement has grown up within a few years past. The ground on which the village is situated, forms a part of the \"Rumbout Patent,\" so called, which comprehended an area of nearly 200 square miles. A considerable portion of this immense tract was continued in the possession of Rumbour's descendants from the date of the patent down to the present time, a period of nearly 140 years. The\nSchenck and Brett families, through whose influence and exertions the tract has been so greatly improved, are among the lineal descendants of the original proprietors.\n\nThere are now several towns and villages within this patent, the limits of which were determined by a mode then common among the settlers, by which the outlines of tracts were regulated by the distance an Indian could walk in a given number of hours.\n\nFishkill.\u2014The seat of justice for Dutchess county. Matteawan and Fishkill Landing, or Martinsville, are the principal settlements within the limits of Rumbout's tract. The two latter may be regarded as one town, both having attained to their present importance in consequence of the establishment of factories in the neighborhood. The site of Martinsville ascends by a gentle acclivity from the landing place, until it reaches an elevated plane 80 or 90 feet above the river, where most of the trades-people and mechanics reside. An extensive pier a quarter of a mile in length, constructed at a cost of about $100,000, forms the chief landing, which communicates with the opposite town of Newburgh, by a steam ferry-boat. There are in the village two places of worship, four public houses, 10 or 12 stores, one iron foundry, a machine shop and flouring mill at the mouth of Fishkill creek, and about 130 other buildings.\n\nMatteawan.\u2014A remarkably neat and flourishing village of Dutchess county, situated about one mile east from Martinsville, on both sides of Fishkill creek. The ground upon which the town is built is gently undulating, with here and there a prominent eminence, which, with the adjacent mountains on the east, and the romantic stream at their base, altogether form a scene of surpassing beauty and loveliness.\n\nThe town, which is well built with houses mostly in the cottage style, having court-yards in front, present an appearance of great neatness and rural beau.\nIt comprises a principal avenue with smaller streets, some of which lead to bridges over the creek, where many of the operatives reside. The factory, consisting of several detached buildings, in which the various branches are conducted, is situated on the right or west bank of Fishkill Creek, about one mile above its discharge into the Hudson. On the same side are most of the dwelling houses and some beautiful seats, among which is that of Mr. P. H. Schenck, who is largely interested in the Mattawan establishments.\n\nThe Episcopal church, near the Teller mansion, is a neat and commodious edifice; and on the east side of the creek stands the Presbyterian church. Mattawan, from its situation and salubrious air, is likely to maintain its respectability; the neighborhood having been selected as the residence of many wealthy families. The present population of the village exceeds 1,000, which, on the revival of business, so greatly depressed of late years, will doubtless increase rapidly.\n\nHamburg.\u2014An inconsiderable village of Dutchess county, 6 miles above Martinsville.\n\nMarlboro.\u2014A small village of Ulster county, on the west bank of the Hudson.\n\nMilton.\u2014A small settlement on the west bank of the river.\n\nBarnegat\u2014A busy little town of Dutchess county, with about 200 inhabitants, chiefly engaged in lime business.\n\nPoughkeepsie.\u2014A large and commercial town of Dutchess county, and the depot for an extensive and productive agricultural district in the rear.

In the town are also two female seminaries, a lyceum, a savings bank, a whaling company, 3 printing offices, from which papers are issued.\n\nThe town occupies one of the finest and most picturesque sites on the river, but owing to its elevated and remote position, it cannot be seen to advantage from the river.\n\nNew Paltz Landing.\u2014A small settlement of Ulster county, comprising 1 church, 1 grist mill, and about 50 other buildings, with about 200 inhabitants.\n\nHyde Park.\u2014A handsome village on the east bank of the Hudson, in Dutchess county. The settlement, which extends from the river bank to the post road, a distance of nearly a mile, comprises about 120 buildings, including three churches and several extensive manufacturing establishments, and about 750 inhabitants.\n\nPelham.\u2014A small collection of buildings on the west bank of the Hudson, nearly opposite to\n\nStatesburg.\u2014Another inconsiderable village on the east side.\n\nRhynbeck.\u2014Situated about two miles east of the Hudson, where it has a landing, also a considerable village, is a large and important town, with a population of not less than 1,200.

In the town are a court house, jail, 4 churches, academy, 2 banks, 6 public houses, 2 printing offices, 1 iron foundry, tobacco, carriage, leather, and many other manufactories. Kingston, or Esopus, as it was originally called, is intimately connected with our revolutionary history.\n\nIt was taken and burnt by the British, on the 16th of October, 1777, the day before the surrender of Burgoyne. The incendiaries, on learning the fate of Burgoyne, precipitately decamped and took shelter on board their vessels, then lying in the Hudson. A short distance from Kingston is the busy little town of\n\nEddyville.\u2014Situated on the left bank of the Rondout, and at the eastern terminus of the Hudson and Delaware canal, by which the coal and other produce of the Lackawana Valley, in Pennsylvania, are transported to the banks of the Hudson. The chief seat of the coal trade is at the neighboring village of Rondout, where extensive coal depots are established.\n\nRed Hook Lower Landing, or Barrytown, a small settlement on the east side of the Hudson, consisting of store houses, and other buildings connected with the landing.

Population about 3,000.\n\nThe Catskill and Canajoharie railroad is now completed, and in use as far as Cooksburg, a distance of 26 miles. About 14 miles W. S. W. from Catskill, is the celebrated mountain house of\n\n**Pine Orchard.**\u2014Which is situated on the N. E. declivity of Catskill mountains, at an elevation of 3,000 feet above the surface of the Hudson river. A mile or two beyond the hotel, are the Katerskill falls. A short distance above the falls are two small lakes, from which the water escapes through a contracted channel, and is precipitated at two bounds down a perpendicular rock to the depth of nearly 200 feet. The cataract and its surrounding objects form an assemblage of everything that is sublimely picturesque and romantic in beautiful scenery.\n\n**Athens.**\u2014An incorporated town of Greene county, containing about 1,200 inhabitants.

The present population is about 1,000, and rapidly increasing.\n\nHere commences the Albany and West Stockbridge railroad, which, with the western and Boston and Worcester railroads, form a continuous line from Albany to Boston, a distance of 200 miles.\n\nALBANY.\n\nA large, rich, and populous city of the state of New-York, of which it is the capital. Few cities of its size have their public buildings so fine, numerous, and well kept. Here are many handsome churches belonging to various denominations. The state-house, or legislative hall, is one of the principal ornaments of the city; and the immense basin formed by a pier 4,300 feet in length, is one of the largest and most commodious on the canal, where a vast number of canal boats of all sorts may be seen. The streets are spacious and well paved. In addition to the facilities of intercourse afforded by the great Erie and Champlain canals, which commence here, those of the numerous railroads which centre in Albany are equally important and extensive. Thus advantageously situated, it forms the principal entrepot between the city of New-York and the north-western interior; and with Troy occupies the common centre of an immense inland trade.\n\nAlbany possesses many splendid public and private buildings, literary and scientific institutions, and in every respect presents the appearance of a well ordered and prosperous city. Population, in 1840, 33,721. It is one of the oldest settlements in the United States, the Dutch having had a fort here as\nearly as 1612. Many of the buildings of the city, with their gable ends to the streets, still remain to mark its origin. A large and respectable portion of the inhabitants are of Dutch descent, many of whom still retain much of the primitive simplicity and industry which characterized their ancestors.\n\nThe State House.\u2014A fine stone building, 115 feet in length and 90 in width, occupies a beautiful position at the head of State street, at an elevation of 220 feet above the river. The grounds which surround the capitol are tastefully arranged, and form one of the most attractive promenades of the city. The other public buildings consist of the City Hall, a beautiful marble structure, occupied by the various departments of the Government; jail, 2 academies, State Hall. The Albany, Farmers', and Mechanics' Banks, and the Museum, are also remarkably fine buildings; Medical College Exchange, in State st.; Alms-house; 2 Asylums for Orphans; 30 churches, some very elegant; 8 banking houses, and many others equally deserving of notice. Institutions for the promotion of literature, science, and the arts, are numerous and well conducted. The principal branches of industry carried on in the city, comprise carriages, malt liquors, fire arms, jewelry, nails, hats and caps, snuff and segars, cordage, soap, musical instruments, tin and sheet iron ware, printing types, woolen and cotton goods, &c.; and its commerce is proportionably varied and extensive. There are nearly 1,400 persons engaged in mercantile pursuits, besides a vast number employed in the subordinate branches of trade.\n\nThe situation of Albany is one of the finest on the Hudson; seated partly on the declivity of a hill and partly on the margin of the river, it spreads its buildings along the bank, and covers the adjacent eminences with its beautiful structures. Its suburbs stretch in gentle curves along the shore above, below, and in the rear; from whence is beheld an almost unrival-\nled assemblage of picturesque and beautiful scenery. In the north, the shores of the Hudson, with Troy and the little villages of Waterford and Lansinburg, whilst in the east, the hills of Vermont, with their verdant sides and towering peaks, bound the prospect. The centre contains the city, with its public and private buildings rising one above the other, backed by the heights, on which are the Capitol, State Hall, the Academy, and City Hall.\n\nHotels.\u2014City, Engle, Mansion House, United States, Montgomery Hall, American, Clinton, Congress Hall, Franklin, Rensselaer, Columbian, &c.\n\nROUTES FROM ALBANY.\n\nRoute from Albany to Niagara Falls, Buffalo, &c. via Utica, Rochester, and Batavia, by railroad.\n\n| Location          | Miles |\n|-------------------|-------|\n| Schenectady       | 16    |\n| Glenville         | 4     |\n| Amsterdam         | 10    |\n| Tripe Hill        | 7     |\n| Caughnewaga       | 4     |\n| Fonda             | 1     |\n| Palatine Bridge   | 11    |\n| St. Johnsville    | 9     |\n| Little Falls      | 10    |\n| Herkimer          | 7     |\n| Utica             | 14    |\n| Whitesboro        | 3     |\n| Oriskany          | 4     |\n| Rome              | 7     |\n| Verona Centre     | 8     |\n| Canestota         | 11    |\n| Fayette           | 16    |\n| Syracuse          | 4     |\n| Camillus          | 8     |\n| Elbridge          | 8     |\n| Auburn            | 10    |\n| Cayuga            | 9     |\n| Bridgeport        | 1     |\n| Waterloo          | 9     |\n| Geneva            | 9     |\n| Vienna            | 9     |\n| Canandaigua       | 14    |\n| Victor            | 10    |\n| Rochester         | 17    |\n| Churchville       | 14    |\n| Begen             | 7     |\n| Morganville       | 7     |\n| Batavia           | 5     |\n| Attica            | 10    |\n| Alden             | 10    |\n| Lancaster         | 8     |\n| Buffalo           | 12    |\n| Black Rock        | 2     |\n| Tonawanda         | 9     |\n| Fort Schlosser    | 11    |\n| Niagara Falls     | 1     |\n\n181 182 191 200 209 223 233 250 264 272 278 283 293 303 311 323 325 334 345 346\nSchenectady.\u2014An incorporated city, and seat of justice for Schenectady county, is situated on the right or south bank of the Mohawk, 16 miles from Albany by the railroad, and 30 by the Erie canal. It is one of the oldest towns in the state, being nearly co-eval with Albany. Many of the buildings are elegant, but like all the ancient towns in New-York, the various structures present a somewhat incongruous appearance. Those of a recent date serve to show the advance in elegance and convenience that has been effected in the course of a few years. The chief buildings are, Union College in the N. E. quarter, which was founded in 1794, and has since maintained a high degree of reputation; a county court house and jail, city hall, 4 banks, 10 churches, 16 or 18 hotels, 1 extensive cotton factory, grist mills, iron foundries, together with the usual stores, work shops, factories, &c.

The rugged and precipitous sides of this petra-like gorge attain to a great height, whence a scene of wild and romantic beauty presents itself on every side. The beds of the Erie canal on the right, and of the railroad on the left bank, have been excavated from the solid rock, which here and there overhangs the lines, and seems to threaten the beholder with instant destruction.\n\nLittle Falls is essentially a manufacturing place, having an inexhaustible water power of great extent, which is still in some degree unemployed. Woolen goods, paper, iron castings, malt liquors and flour, are its principal manufactures. Every other article of necessity, such as hats, boots, shoes, tin-ware &c., are supplied by the numerous minor factories of the place.

Syracuse stands on the Erie canal, at the point where the Salina side canal leaves the main trunk. The Salina flats ex-\ntend between Syracuse and the village of Salina. In a state of nature, these flats being low, in part marshy, were subject to occasional inundation; but, by means of extensive drains, they have now a dry surface, which is an exuberantly rich alluvial deposit. The outlet of Salina lake in Seneca river, having been deepened, contribute also to desiccate the flats. Syracuse is celebrated for its manufacture of salt, of which immense quantities, are annually made chiefly by solar evaporation.\n\nCamillus.\u2014A handsome village of Onondaga county, containing about 700 inhabitants, two churches, and nearly 125 dwelling houses.\n\nElbridge\u2014A neat little village of Onondaga county, containing two churches, 60 buildings and about 300 inhabitants.\n\nAuburn.\u2014A large, handsome and important town, and seat of justice for Cayuga county.

It is about 40 miles in length, with a mean width of two and a half miles, is of great depth, and abounds with fine fish. Its banks, which are celebrated for their picturesque beauty and sublimity, are adorned with orchards and cultivated fields, and interspersed with towns, villages and habitations.\n\nSteam-boats ply regularly between Cayuga bridge and Ithaca, at the head of the lake, where the railroad from Owego terminates. About a mile west of Cayuga is\n\nBridgeport.\u2014A little village of Seneca county, consisting of about 30 buildings.\n\nWaterloo\u2014A large and remarkably handsome town, and, with Ovid, the seat of justice for Seneca county, containing nearly 3,000 inhabitants.

W. it receives the waters of\n\nSeneca Lake.\u2014Situated between Seneca and Tomkins counties on the east, and Steuben, Yates and...\nOntario on the west. It is about 43 miles in length, two and a half in mean breadth, and nearly 600 feet deep. The waters are remarkably pure and transparent, containing fish of various sorts. It is navigated by steam-boats from Geneva to Jefferson, where the Elmira canal leaves the lake. The outlet of Crooked Lake enters Seneca lake on the west, after a descent of 270 feet in 6 miles. The banks of both are highly romantic and beautiful: the entire region presents a series of landscapes, which render it in a high degree, worthy of attention from the traveler and philosopher.\n\nGeneva.\u2014An incorporated town of Ontario county, on the north-west margin of Seneca lake, containing about 4,000 inhabitants. Its site is uncommonly fine, rising by a gentle acclivity from the water side, and affording an extensive view of the lake and adjacent country, which abounds in the most enchanting and beautiful prospects. The aspect of Geneva and its environs from the lake, is not less beautiful: the entire scenes will amply repay the tourist for his trouble in viewing it. The western part of the town is, by far, the neatest portion of it, and is in part built on an eminence rising nearly 100 feet above the lake. Its streets are wide and kept in fine condition, with handsome and commodious buildings, chiefly occupied as dwellings. The lower part is the principal seat of business, where the factories, stores, &c. are mostly located. The chief buildings are those of Geneva college, 10 churches, 2 banking houses, 2 printing houses, several grist and saw mills, furnaces, carriage factories, and about 500 dwelling houses.\n\nVienna.\u2014A village of Ontario county, situated on the right bank of Canandaigua outlet, comprising 200 dwellings, 3 churches, 6 grist mills, 1 furnace, 2 brew houses, 2 distilleries, carriage factory, &c. Population about 1,500.\n\nCanandaigua.\u2014A beautiful town and seat of justice of Ontario county, situated at the junction of Ca-\nnandaigua lake with its outlet. The principal avenue extends westward from the lake shore, and is lined by well built and handsome houses for a distance of nearly two miles. Among the buildings are a court house, jail and other county offices, 5 churches, 3 banks, academy, besides stores, warehouses, factories, mills, &c. Population 2,800.\n\nThe situation of the town is picturesque and beautiful in a high degree, and, taken in connection with the adjacent country and its silvery lake, affords one of the most delightful prospects in the world. The Lake, whose waters are as clear as crystal, and abound with trout and other fish, is about 20 miles in length, one in breadth, and, like the others, very deep.\n\nVictor.\u2014A neat little village of 300 inhabitants, situated near the railroad, in Ontario county.\n\nROCHESTER.\n\nA large commercial and manufacturing city of Monroe county, situated on both sides of the Genesee river, above the great falls, and six miles from its entrance into Lake Ontario. It is the seat of justice for Monroe county, and the third city of the state in point of population, which, in 1840, was 29,191, but has, doubtless, increased greatly since that time. The Erie canal passes through the city, and across the Genesee, by a splendid aqueduct, where it is joined by the Genesse valley canal.\n\nThe plan of the city is regular, most of the streets crossing each other at right angles: the public buildings consist of the court house and other county offices, 20 places of worship, college, atheneum, museum, 2 asylums for orphans, arcade, 25 hotels, &c. The productions of the numerous factories and workshops, in and around the city, consist of bread-stuffs in great abundance, cabinet ware, woolen and cotton goods, carpets, jewelry, clothing, hats and caps, boots and shoes, copper and tin ware, carriages, canal and other boats, iron castings, machinery, prepared lum-\nALBANY TO NIAGARA FALLS.\n\nRochester owes its great eminence, as a manufacturing town, partly to its advantageous situation, and partly to the industry and ingenuity of its inhabitants. It is located in the midst of a fertile country, intersected by canals and railroads and on a river admirably adapted for manufacturing purposes. To the natural facilities thus afforded, and the means of disposing of its manufactured products by the aid of its canals and railways, may fairly be ascribed the rapid growth of Rochester, and the great prosperity of its people. Among the interesting objects of Rochester, that of the falls claims the first attention.\n\nGenesee Falls.\u2014Like those of Niagara, the upper Genesee falls consist of three principal Chutes, divided from each other by clusters of rocks, into three nearly equal parts. The greatest height of these falls is 96 feet. The lower fall, about a mile and a half below, has an unbroken pitch of 105 feet, to a rocky bed, over which the waters pass rapidly to the head of navigation, whence it flows calmly into its great recipient, the \"beautiful Ontario.\"\n\nMount Hope Cemetery.\u2014A rural place of sepulture, situated in the southern suburb of the city, and the Grand Aqueduct over the Genesee, also deserve attention.\n\nChurchville.\u2014A small village of Monroe county, containing about 50 buildings including 2 churches, a woolen factory and 300 inhabitants.\n\nBergen and Morgansville.\u2014Two small villages of Geneseo county, each containing about 200 inhabitants.\n\nBatavia.\u2014Seat of justice for Genesee county, is finely situated on the north bank of Tonawanda creek, and contains upwards of 2,000 inhabitants. The public buildings are, a court house, jail, arsenal, 2 banks, 5 churches, 1 female boarding school, 1 grist mill, 2\nfurnaces, and others. [Persons destined for the falls of Niagara, may proceed by stage hence to Lockport, distant 30 miles, whence a railroad conducts to the falls.]\n\nAttica.\u2014An incorporated village of Genesee county, containing about 900 inhabitants, 2 churches, a bank, and the customary complement of stores, taverns and shops. The Tonawanda and Attica and Buffalo railroads unite here.\n\nAlden.\u2014A village of Erie county, comprising 30 dwellings, 1 church, and about 250 inhabitants.\n\nLancaster.\u2014A village of Erie county, containing about 100 buildings, including 4 churches, 1 grist and 2 saw mills, and 600 inhabitants.\n\nBUFFALO.\n\nThe capital of Erie county and a port of entry, is situated on the eastern shore of Lake Erie, at the mouth of Buffalo creek: population, by census of 1840, 18,213. This city is admirably situated on an elevated plain, and being almost wholly of modern date, is much more regularly laid out and handsomely built than most of the other interior towns. Buffalo, then a mere village, was burnt by the British during the late war; but has risen with augmented splendor from its ashes.\n\nThe streets, which are mostly wide and furnished with side walks, some of them being, in the splendor of their stores and their elaborately painted signs, nowise inferior to those of the Metropolis. The growth of Buffalo within the last few years has been most rapid. Along the lake side, which, prior to 1810, was little else than a sandy flat, now extends a succession of handsome buildings, which, with the shipping and the activity everywhere displayed, present the appearance of a large commercial city. The public buildings consist of a court house and jail, 16 churches, 2 banks, theatre, mills, and a vast number of factories, common to places of this description. The\nmost important of these are, 3 for carriages, 14 for malt liquors, 5 for soap and candles, 4 for tobacco, 9 for ironmongery, 2 for chemicals, and 8 printing houses. A pier, 1,500 feet in length, extends into the lake from the bank, below the mouth of Buffalo creek. Though now of such importance, little more than fifteen years have elapsed since Buffalo was correctly described by Darby as \"a village containing 1,000 inhabitants.\" The progress of the town in the interval in commerce and in the accumulation of wealth and population, is unprecedented in the history of settlement. The situation of Buffalo necessarily renders it a principal seat of the trade between the eastern cities and the western and north-western states, and as the population and trade of those states increased, it could not fail proportionally to augment the trade of Buffalo.\n\nThere are now (1843) upwards of 75 steam-boats and about 350 sailing vessels employed in the lake trade, much the larger portion of which centres in Buffalo. 4,061 vessels of every sort were entered or cleared at the custom-house in 1840. The amount of merchandise sent eastward on the canal in 1826, was 5,131 tons; in 1840, 177,606 tons. Should the population of Buffalo continue to increase in the same ratio as it has done for the last 12 or 15 years, of which there is no reason to doubt, it will contain, 30 years hence, a population of nearly 200,000.\n\nBlackrock, 2 miles north from Buffalo, on the Erie canal, is a large incorporated village, containing nearly 2,000 inhabitants, with extensive and various factories, and mercantile establishments. The great pier, built at the expense of the state, deserves attention.\n\nTonawanda.\u2014A village of Erie county, containing 700 inhabitants, situated on Grand Island sound, at the discharge of Tonawanda creek. The Erie canal and the Buffalo and Niagara falls railroad pass through the village.\nFort Schlosser.\u2014Built by the British during the old French war, stands in front of the rapids, about a mile above the falls. Here the steamer Caroline was destroyed by a detachment of British troops a few years since, from which the well known McLeod affair took its rise.\n\nNiagara Falls.\u2014A magnificent cataract in that portion of the river St. Lawrence which extends between lakes Erie and Ontario, commonly called \"Niagara river.\" This river issues from the N. E. extremity of Lake Erie, near Buffalo, and runs northward 20 miles to Goat or Iris island, where it is precipitated over a limestone ledge into a deep and narrow chasm, whence it proceeds, with a constantly decreasing velocity, a farther distance of 15 miles, and enters Lake Ontario, between the villages of Ningara and Youngstown. In this course of 35 miles the river descends 384 feet, this being the difference of level between Lake Erie and Lake Ontario.\n\nGoat Island, at the very verge of the cataract, divides it into two sheets of water; one of these, called the Horse-shoe, on the Canada side, is 1,800 feet wide, and 158 feet in perpendicular height; and the other, called the American Falls, is about 600 in width, and 164 in height. The breadth of the island is about 1,500 feet. The rock over which the water is precipitated, consists of a compact limestone in nearly horizontal strata, resting upon a mass of soft shale, which decays and crumbles away more rapidly than the former; so that the calcareous rock forms an over-hanging mass, projecting 40 feet or more beyond the concave rock below.\n\nBy the continual destruction of the rocks, owing to the eddies and spray rushing against them, the falls have, within the last 50 years, receded upwards of 150 feet; and this process has unquestionably been going on for countless ages. There seems to be no reasonable ground for doubting that the falls were once at Queenstown, 7 miles below their present po-\nALBANY TO NIAGARA FALLS.\n\nSituation. Such being the case, the falls must be destined, in process of time, to invade Lake Erie itself, which would then be completely drained, and its present bed thus converted into fertile fields and cultivated gardens.\n\nThe depth of the water is much greater on the Canadian, than on the American side; and hence, while the scarcely hidden rocks below the American fall cause the flood to be broken into foam, the deep green hue of the other, is but slightly changed by the crests rising above it.\n\nThe finest view of the falls, perhaps, is from the Table rock on the Canadian shore, and from the banks above, whence the rapids may be examined: the latter, however, are best seen from Goat Island; to which access is had by means of a bridge from the American side. On the north side of Goat Island, the rocks projecting into the river immediately over the falls are reached by another wooden bridge, below which the water rushes with frightful velocity. From these rocks, on which an observatory has been erected, the view over the precipice is at once terrific and grand.\n\nAs the banks of the ravine below the falls rise to the height of 200 feet or more, artificial means are necessary for effecting a descent to the water's edge. A spiral staircase has been constructed on each side, and another in front of Goat Island, by which one may descend to a ledge, styled \"Termination Rock,\" actually underneath the great fall: by these means the falls may be viewed in almost every possible direction.\n\nAmong the principal waterfalls throughout the world, there are several that exceed in height those of Niagara; but, with regard to the quantity of water discharged, in an unbroken mass, there are none that can be compared to those of Niagara. In these respects they are pre-eminent.\nThe following table exhibits the relative elevations of the most remarkable cataracts:\n\nStaubach, Switzerland, ..................900 feet.\nTequendama, S. America, ...............800\nVelino, Italy, ................................300\nMontmorenci, Canada east, ..............246\nCaterskill, New York, ....................210\nNiagara, (mean height) ...................161\n\nThere are several interesting objects in the vicinity of the falls which deserve attention; among them may be mentioned the Burning Spring, near the outlet of Chippewa creek whirlpool, two miles below the falls; Sorcerer's cave, just below the falls; the battle fields of Chippewa, Lundy's Lane and Queenstown; Fort Schlosser, where the steamboat Caroline was destroyed; the remains of Brock's monument, near Queenstown; Welland canal in Canada, extending from Lake Erie to Lake Ontario, and the villages of Chippewa, Manchester Falls, Lewistown, Queens-town, Whitehaven or Grand Island, Tuscarora and Seneca Indians\u2014the former near Lewistown, and the latter 4 miles S. E. from Buffalo.\n\nThe vicinity of Niagara has, in some degree, become classic ground. Among the battles of the last war, between Great Britain and the United States, there were perhaps none more sanguinary, nor the contest between the combattants so obstinate as those of Queenstown, October 18th, 1814, in which Gen. Brock was killed; of Chippewa, July 5th, 1814, and of Bridgewater.\n\nRoute from Albany to Buffalo, via Utica and Rochester, by the Erie canal.\n\n| Location          | Miles |\n|-------------------|-------|\n| West Troy         | 7     |\n| Cohoes Falls      | 3     |\n| Lower aqueduct    | 3     |\n| Schenectady       | 17    |\n| Amsterdam         | 17    |\n| Fultonville       | 10    |\n\nRoute from Albany to Buffalo, via Utica and Rochester, by the Erie canal.\n\n| Location          | Miles |\n|-------------------|-------|\n| West Troy         | 7     |\n| Cohoes Falls      | 3     |\n| Lower aqueduct    | 3     |\n| Schenectady       | 17    |\n| Amsterdam         | 17    |\n| Fultonville       | 10    |\n| Location          | Population |\n|-------------------|------------|\n| Canajoharie       | 12 69      |\n| Fort Plain        | 3 72       |\n| Little Falls      | 16 88      |\n| Herkimer, Up.Br.  | 8 96       |\n| Frankfort         | 5 101      |\n| Utica             | 9 110      |\n| Whitesboro'       | 4 114      |\n| Oriskany          | 3 117      |\n| Rome              | 8 125      |\n| New London        | 7 132      |\n| Canastota         | 14 146     |\n| New Boston        | 4 150      |\n| Chittenango       | 3 153      |\n| Manlius Centre    | 9 162      |\n| Lodi              | 8 170      |\n| Syracuse          | 1 171      |\n| Geddes            | 2 173      |\n| Camillus          | 6 179      |\n| Jordan            | 11 190     |\n| Port Byron        | 9 199      |\n| Montezuma         | 6 205      |\n| Clyde             | 11 216     |\n| Lyons             | 9 225      |\n| Newark            | 7 232      |\n| Port Gibson       | 3 235      |\n| Palmyra           | 5 240      |\n| Fairport          | 12 252     |\n| Pittsford         | 7 259      |\n| Rochester         | 10 269     |\n| Spencersville     | 12 281     |\n| Brockport         | 8 289      |\n| Holley            | 5 294      |\n| Hulberton         | 4 298      |\n| Albion            | 6 304      |\n| Knowlsville       | 7 311      |\n| Medina            | 4 315      |\n| Middleport        | 6 321      |\n| Lockport          | 12 333     |\n| Pendleton         | 7 340      |\n| Tonawanda         | 12 352     |\n| Black Rock        | 9 361      |\n| Buffalo           | 2 363      |\n\n**West Troy.**\u2014An incorporated town of Albany county, situated on the right bank of the Hudson, immediately opposite to the more \"ancient Troy\" of Rensselaer county, which will be noticed hereafter.\n\nWest Troy is a new town, the great mass of its buildings having been erected within the last 10 or 15 years. It now contains more than 1,000 buildings, including 10 churches, 20 extensive manufactories, a bank, a vast number of warehouses, stores and workshops, and about 900 dwellings, with a population of 5,500. The United States Arsenal, an immense establishment, consisting of 33 buildings and extensive grounds, is situated in West Troy, and forms one of its most conspicuous features. The Hudson is here crossed by a fine bridge and horse boats.\nCohoes Falls.\u2014A beautiful and romantic cataract of the Mohawk river, situated near its entrance into the Hudson. The principal fall has a descent of about 70 feet, but the entire fall, including the rapids above and below, exceeds 120 feet. A fine view of the falls may be had from the bridge about half a mile below.\n\nLower Aqueduct.\u2014Here the Erie canal crosses from the south to the north bank of the Mohawk, which it follows for 6 miles, and then repasses the river, by the Upper Aqueduct, and resumes its course along the south or right bank of the stream.\n\nSchenectady.\u2020\n\nAmsterdam.\u2020\n\nFultonville.\u2014A village of Montgomery county, containing 70 dwellings, a church and about 400 inhabitants, chiefly occupied in manufacturing and the lumber trade.

With the exception of Buffalo and Rochester, it is the most important commercial and manufacturing town in western New York. Lockport now numbers upwards of 7,000 inhabitants, and nearly 1,000 buildings of every description: included among the latter are, a court house, jail, 12 churches, 20 hotels, 2 banks, and about 40 extensive factories, which produce immense quantities of articles; such as cotton and woolen goods, prepared lumber, ground plaster, machinery, iron castings, and agricultural instruments of every sort, carriages, leather, bread stuffs, and many other articles. The power employed by these factories is derived from Lake Erie, through the medium of the Erie canal; which, having a descent here of 60 feet, supplies an almost unlimited amount of hydraulic force. The prodigious excavations through which the canal now passes and descends the terrace into the Ontario valley, and the ponderous locks by which the descent is effected, are every way deserving of careful examination. This is one of the most costly sections of the canal, having been cut through compact rock for a great distance, both horizontally and vertically.\n\nPassengers for the falls leave the canal here, and proceed by the railroad a distance of 24 miles. Conveyance in almost every direction is afforded by the canal boats, stages, or cars, which leave Lockport daily.\n\nPendleton.\u2014A small settlement of Niagara county, situated at the junction of the Erie canal and Tonawanda creek, containing nearly 200 inhabitants.

The waters resemble those of Saratoga, though not so strongly impregnated with the mineral ingredients which characterise the latter. They are chiefly saline and chalybeate, but in various degrees: Some are exceedingly cold, and strongly charged with oxide of iron and carbonic acid gas. Their medicinal qualities are of the cathartic and tonic kind. The chief ingredients of these celebrated waters consist of chloride of sodium, bicarbonites of magnesia and soda, carbonate of lime, with slight traces of carbonate of iron, silex, and alumine.\n\nIn addition to about 220 dwellings, there are, in the village, 4 churches, 1 bank, a court house, jail, and several excellent hotels and boarding houses, reading rooms, &c. Ballston Spa is, in every respect, one of the most pleasant and salubrious places of resort in the county. Here is a railroad to Troy.\nOne of the principal drives from the Spa is to Ballston Lake, 5 miles southward, where equipments for fishing and fowling may be obtained. A few miles to the S. E. is Round Lake, another attractive spot, abounding also with fish and fowl. The waters of these lakes are discharged into the Hudson by Anthony's Kill.\n\nSaratoga Springs.\u2014The most celebrated of these springs occupy the central part of Saratoga county, and are about equidistant from Schenectady and Glenn's Falls. Every accommodation is afforded the visitors by the spacious and elegant hotels which abound here. The most noted of these are, the United States, near the railroad depot; Congress Hall, near Congress spring; Pavilion, near Flat Rock spring; Union Hall, opposite Congress Hall; Columbian, near the Pavilion; Washington Hall, in the north end of the village; American, Adelphi, Montgomery, and Mansion House. In the eastern suburbs, Prospect Hall and Highland Hall; together with some other hotels and extensive boarding houses. There are also commodious bathing houses, circulating library, reading rooms, mineralogical cabinet, &c., &c.\n\nAmong the other buildings are, 6 churches, a railroad depot, an academy, 2 foundries, printing offices, &c., and about 325 dwellings.\n\nThe springs of Saratoga, now the resort of thousands of persons in search of health or pleasure, from almost every part of the world, were discovered long anterior to the revolutionary war.\n\nCongress, Washington, Putnam, Pavilion, Iodine, Hamilton, High Rock, and Flat Rock, are the names by which the principal springs are known.\n\nIn addition to these are others, called the Ten springs, which include the Union spring, about a mile east of the others. The ingredients which compose the waters of these springs are nearly the same in all, differing but slightly in the relative quan-\ntity of each. Dr. Steel's analysis of one of them, (Congress spring,) affords a sufficient insight into the nature and qualities of the entire series.\n\nFrom 231 cubic inches (one gallon) of the water were obtained\u2014\n\n| Grains.                                      |\n|---------------------------------------------|\n| Chloride of sodium, (sea salt,) ............ | 385 0 |\n| Hydriodate of soda,.......................... | 3 5   |\n| Bi-carbonate of soda,......................... | 8 982 |\n| \" magnesia,.................................. | 95 788|\n| Carbonate of lime,........................... | 98 098|\n| \" iron,...................................... | 5 075 |\n| Silex,........................................ | 1 5   |\n| Hydro-bromate of potash, a trace.            |\n\nTotal Grains, ..................... 597 943\n\nCarbonic acid gas, cubic inches, ...... 311\nAtmospheric air, ................................ 7\n\nGaseous contents, ............... 318\n\nSaratoga Lake.\u2014Situated about 5 miles S. E. from the spring, is much frequented by the lovers of romantic scenery by which this beautiful lake is surrounded. Its waters abound with several kinds of fish; as perch, pike, pickerel, &c.; and the variety of wild fowl and other game which inhabit its borders, afford ample amusement for the sportsman. The waters of these springs flow through a small ravine into Owl lake, thence into Kayaderosers creek, a tributary of Saratoga lake, which has its discharge into the Hudson through Fish creek, about 10 miles E. of Saratoga, on the falls of Fish creek, which are also much frequented as one of the \"lions\" of the neighborhood; and a little further on, near Schuylersville, is the battle-ground of Saratoga, where the British army, under General Burgoyne, surrendered to the American forces, October 17, 1777.\n\nFortsville.\u2014A post office of Moreau township.\nGlen's Falls.\u2014A cataract or rather a cascade of the Hudson, with an entire descent of 70 feet. The rock is here cut and abraded in the most extraordinary manner; caves, crevices, and gorges of almost every imaginable form are presented to the sight; over which, or through which the water plunges, or silently insinuates itself, until it reaches the bed below, where it calmly reposes as if wearied with the mighty struggle just ended.\n\nThe rock, an horizontal secondary limestone, is rich in its appropriate fossils. Some of the finest specimens of the trilobite have been found here, together with many other organic remains.\n\nThe falls can be best seen from the fine new bridge, immediately below.\n\nHere an extensive and thriving town has grown up, consisting of nearly 300 buildings with about 2,000 inhabitants. Among the former are, 3 churches, 10 or 12 mills of various sorts, some for sawing the beautiful black marble which is found on both sides of the river.\n\nJessup's Falls.\u2014Ten miles above Glen's Falls is a cataract of the Hudson, which here descends in an unbroken sheet from a height of 100 feet. Hadley's Falls 3 or 4 miles higher up the stream, also deserves attention.\n\nCaldwell\u2014A village and seat of justice of Warren county, containing about 225 inhabitants, a court house, jail, 1 church, several hotels, mills, &c.\n\nAmong the relics of former wars in this vicinity, are Forts George, south-east of the village, William Henry, near the former, and Gage; and still further south-east, is Bloody Pond, into which the dead bodies of about 1,000 French and English soldiers were thrown after the battle of Sept. 7, 1775.\n\nThe Lake House.\u2014The principal hotel of the place, is much resorted to, and is the point of departure of the steamboat which conducts the traveler through Lake George.\u2014One of the most beautiful and ro-\nmantic sheets of water in the state, is connected by a narrow channel and deep fall with Lake Champlain, to which it is tributary. It has in its immediate vicinity, or rather rising from its banks, some of the most elevated summits in this part of the state, having their precipitous sides covered with forest trees.\n\nThere is a vast number of small islands in the lake, many of which are picturesque and beautiful to a high degree. One of them (Diamond Island) contains beautiful quartz crystals, resembling, in their purity and form, diamonds of the first water. Travelers uniformly bear testimony to the tranquil beauty and sylvan scenery which characterize this beautiful spot. Nature here assumes her most charming and alluring aspect, to gratify and astonish her admirers; here rocks piled on rocks rise to a towering height, and seem to threaten with instant destruction those who venture beneath their overhanging summits. In some places, the scenery is of the softest and most agreeable kind, consisting of finely sloping banks ornamented with foliage of every hue. The beauty of the scene has not yet been marred by the encroachment of art; nature here reigns triumphant. The waters of the lake, which are elevated 240 feet above the ocean, and perfectly pure and transparent, abound with salmon, trout, pickerel, pike, perch, silver and lake trout. At the foot of the lake is\n\nAlexandria.\u2014A village of Essex county, situated on Lake Champlain, at the outlet of Lake George, containing about 300 inhabitants, mostly engaged in the lumber trade.\n\nThe fall between the two lakes, which is nearly 200 feet, affords an abundant supply of water for manufacturing purposes; but, with the exception of some 5 or 6 saw mills and a few other works, the immense water power which nature has here provided, remains almost wholly unemployed.\n\nFort Ticonderoga.\u2014Situated on the northern point formed by the junction of the two lakes. Of this once\nimportant work nothing but the broken walls remain, presenting a melancholy contrast with the animated scenes around. It is considerably elevated above Lake Champlain, which is seen for a great distance towards the north and south. Its position, it was considered, rendered the post nearly impregnable until attacked from a more elevated point on the opposite side of the outlet of Lake George, which had until then been deemed inaccessible.\n\nThe most important incident connected with this post, then in the possession of the French, was the attack of Gen. Abercrombie, with a force of 16,000 men, on the 5th of July, 1758; who was signally repulsed with a loss of 2,000 men, whilst that of the French did not exceed 50. The French garrison consisted of 3,000 men, including Indians.\n\nThe steamboats of Lake Champlain stop at the landing near Fort Ticonderoga, by which passage may be had to St. Johns, and thence to Montreal.\n\nRoute from Albany to Montreal, via Saratoga, Lake Champlain, &c.\n\n| Location                  | Distance |\n|---------------------------|----------|\n| Saratoga                  | 37       |\n| Sandy Hill, by stage      | 19 56    |\n| Kingsbury                 | 5 61     |\n| Fort Ann                  | 5 66     |\n| Whitehall                 | 11 77    |\n| Ticonderoga, by steamboat | 26 103   |\n| Crown Point               | 14 117   |\n| Westport, by steamboat    | 11 128   |\n| Essex                     | 11 139   |\n| Port Kent                 | 18 157   |\n| Plattsburg                | 18 175   |\n| Rouse's Point             | 30 205   |\n| St. Johns                 | 22 227   |\n| La Prairie, by railroad   | 16 243   |\n| Montreal, by steamboat    | 9 252    |\n\nSandy Hill.\u2014An incorporated village and seat of\njustice of Washington county, with a population of 1,100, and some 200 buildings, including a court house, jail, &c.; 3 churches, 9 extensive factories propelled by the water of the Hudson, which here falls about 12 feet.

It contains about 2,500 inhabitants, 350 dwellings, 3 churches, a bank, 15 factories, besides a due proportion of taverns and workshops; but its chief business is connected with the canal and transportation trade. Here the Champlain canal terminates, and here the lake navigation commences. Steamboats and sailing vessels on the former, and canal boats on the latter, are the chief modes of conveyance employed here, and are very extensively used. Canal boats depart twice a day for Troy, and steam once a day for St. Johns and the intermediate places.\n\nTiconderoga.\n\nCrown Point.\u2014A military post of former times, of which the ruins only remain: they may be seen from the water, perched upon a point on the side of the lake, opposite Cedar point.\n\nWestport.\u2014A village of Essex county, on the west shore of Lake Champlain, containing 600 inhabitants, 2 churches, an academy, &c.

The falls of the Saranac having an entire descent of about 40 feet, supply a water power of great extent. Plattsburg is favorably situated both in regard to the lake trade and that of the interior, which is extremely rich in agricultural and mineral productions.\n\nPlattsburg and its vicinity are memorable as the scene of most important events during the recent conflict with Great Britain. It was near this place that the British General, Sir George Prevost, with 14,000 men, was signally defeated by the American General, Macomb, with only 3,000 men, on the 11th of September, 1814; and on the same day another victory, equally decisive, was achieved over a British fleet by Com. M'Donough, with a force greatly inferior to that of the English.\n\nRouse's Point.\u2014On the west shore of Lake Champlain is the seat of an important military work, commenced by the American government prior to the late\nwar; but on fixing the boundary line between the United States and Canada, under the treaty of Ghent, it was found to be north of the line, and consequently within the British territory. It thus became British property, and as such was held by the provincial government, until restored to the United States in obedience to the Ashburton treaty of 1842.\n\nSt. Johns.\u2014This is the first important place on the lake, or rather outlet of Champlain, within the British dominions. It is situated about 21 miles north of the boundary line, on the left bank of the Sorel, and communicates by railroad with\n\nLa Prairie.\u2014A neat little village of La Prairie District, Canada East, situated on the right bank of the St. Lawrence, opposite the south-east angle of Montreal island.

In addition to this valuable power, another is afforded by the Poasten kill, whose waters are conducted by means of a tunnel 800 feet in length into the city, and thus a fall of 180 feet has been effected.\n\nThe falls and cascades of Paosten and Wyant's creeks deserve attention.\n\nTroy is also distinguished for its literary and scientific institutions; among these are the Rensselaer institute, Troy Female Seminary, Troy Academy for Boys, Lyceum of Natural History, Young Men's Mutual Improvement Association, together with several benevolent institutions. Troy is supplied with excellent water from the Piscawen creek. The water is conveyed to a distributing basin, 90 feet above the Hudson, and situated in the north quarter of the city. The city communicates with West Troy on the opposite side of the Hudson, by means of a bridge. Steam and canal boats, cars and stages, afford almost hourly communication with the surrounding towns. The Rensselaer and Saratoga railroad extends hence, via Waterford and Mechanicville, to Ballston Spa, a distance of 24 miles, where it intersects the Schenectady and Saratoga railroad. The Schenectady and\n**Routes from Troy**\n\nTroy railroad extends from Troy along the south bank of the Mohawk to Schenectady, a distance of 20 miles, where it joins the great western line to Buffalo &c.\n\n| By Steamboat | Miles |\n|--------------|-------|\n| From Troy to Albany,\u2020 | 6 |\n| \" Hudson,\u2020 | 35 |\n| \" Catskill,\u2020 | 40 |\n| \" Poughkeepsie,\u2020 | 77 |\n| \" Newburg,\u2020 | 90 |\n| \" West Point,\u2020 | 99 |\n| \" Sing Sing,\u2020 | 118 |\n| \" Piermont,\u2020 | 127 |\n| \" New-York,\u2020 | 151 |\n\n| By Railroad | Miles |\n|-------------|-------|\n| From Troy to Ballston, Spa,\u2020 | 24 |\n| \" Saratoga Springs,\u2020 | 31 |\n| \" Schenectady,\u2020 | 20 |\n| \" Utica,\u2020 | 97 |\n| \" Syracuse,\u2020 | 150 |\n| \" Auburn,\u2020 | 176 |\n| \" Geneva,\u2020 | 212 |\n| \" Canandaigua,\u2020 | 227 |\n| \" Rochester,\u2020 | 254 |\n| \" Attica,\u2020 | 297 |\n| \" Buffalo,\u2020 | 327 |\n| \" Niagara Falls,\u2020 | 350 |\n\n| By Erie Canal | Miles |\n|---------------|-------|\n| From Troy to Schenectady,\u2020 | 23 |\n| \" Cannajoharie,\u2020 | 62 |\n| \" Little Falls,\u2020 | 81 |\n| \" Utica,\u2020 | 103 |\n| \" Syracuse,\u2020 | 164 |\n| \" Montezuma,\u2020 | 198 |\n| \" Lyons,\u2020 | 218 |\n| \" Rochester,\u2020 | 262 |\n| \" Lockport,\u2020 | 326 |\n| \" Buffalo,\u2020 | 356 |\nBy Champlain Canal.\n\n* From Troy to Mechanicsville,\u2020 ............... 12\n  \" Fort Miller,\u2020 ...................... 33\n  \" Fort Ann,\u2020 ......................... 53\n  \" Whitehall,\u2020 ....................... 65\n\nBy Stage.\n\nFrom Troy to Lansingburgh,\u2020 ............... 3\n  \" Easton,\u2020 .......................... 20\n  \" Hartford,\u2020 ......................... 50\n  \" Whitehall,\u2020 ....................... 66\n  \" Bennington, V.,\u2020 ................. 26\n\nBy Railroad.\n\nFrom Troy to Greenbush,\u2020 ................... 6\n  \" Pittsfield, Mass.,\u2020 ............... 55\n  \" Springfield\u2020 ........................ 109\n  \" Worcester,\u2020 ........................ 162\n  \" Boston,\u2020 .......................... 206\n\nUTICA.\n\nA large and flourishing commercial city of Oneida county, having a population, according to the census of 1840, of 12,810, and upwards of 1,700 buildings. Among these are, 18 places of worship, an exchange, 4 banks of discount and deposit, and 1 for savings; county hall and offices, 2 academies, 1 asylum for orphans, a museum, &c. The New-York State Asylum for Lunatics, an immense establishment, is situated about half a mile to the west of the city.\n\nIts principal manufactures consist of machinery, iron castings, steam engines, oil-cloth, musical instruments, carriages, snuff and segars, malt liquors, canal boats, &c., &c.\n\nUtica is the centre of an extensive and productive agricultural district, and as such, enjoys superior advantages; it is also indebted for its rapid increase and prosperity, in a great measure, to its situation on\nthe Erie canal, which here presents an appearance of life and animation peculiarly striking to one who is not familiar with such scenes.\u2014Canal boats, railroad cars and stages, are constantly arriving or departing; these enable travelers to proceed without delay to any point they may desire. About 14 miles nearly due north, are the famous Trenton Falls, on West Canada creek, a branch of the Mohawk. They consist of a succession of cascades, formed by the passage of the stream over a limestone ridge. The principal fall has a descent of about 70 feet; none of the others exceed 30 feet in vertical height. The aggregate fall of the entire series is about 400 feet, extending in a direction from north to south nearly 4 miles. The rock, a slaty limestone, has every appearance of having been abraded by the action of the water, even to its topmost stratum. In some places the sides of the narrow ravine are nearly 200 feet above the surface of the stream, which is constantly encroaching upon its bed, and sinking gradually deeper into the solid rock. Much of the pathway which extends along the right bank of the stream, consists of a narrow shelf, cut from the rocky side\u2014so narrow and rugged, that supports were found necessary. These consist of iron chains, adjusted horizontally, and fastened to bolts inserted in the rocks: by the aid of these contrivances, which the passenger grasps with his hands, he is enabled to traverse the entire ravine; but not without imminent danger of being precipitated into the roaring cauldron below. An interesting and accomplished young lady (Miss Thorne) lost her life some years since at one of those dangerous passes.\nROUTES FROM UTICA.\n\nFrom Utica to Sackett's Harbor, by stage.\n\n| Trenton          | 14 |\n|------------------|----|\n| Remsen           | 4 18 |\n| Booneville       | 14 32 |\n| Turin            | 11 43 |\n| Martinsburg      | 7 50 |\n\n| Lowville         | 4 54 |\n| Denmark          | 9 63 |\n| Watertown        | 19 82 |\n| Brownville       | 4 86 |\n| Sackett's Harbor | 8 94 |\n\nTrenton.\u2014An incorporated village of Oneida county, containing about 450 inhabitants, 2 churches, stores, &c.

By skillful management, Hell-gate is now passed with.\nout apprehension, and the terrors with which it was formerly approached are no longer felt by navigators.\n\n**Flushing Bay.**\u2014An indentation of Long Island, at the head of which is the pretty village of Flushing mentioned at page 21.\n\n**Throg's Point.**\u2014A projection of West Chester county into Long Island sound, on which is situated Fort Schuyler, a military post recently erected by the United States government, for the defence of the city of New-York. Immediately after passing Throg's Point, we enter\n\n**Long Island Sound.**\u2014An extensive arm of the Atlantic ocean, about 100 miles in length from W. S. W. to E. N. E., and of a mean breadth of 12 miles. Its widest part is off New-Haven harbor, where it is 22 miles in width. The Sound, which communicates with the adjacent ocean, both at its eastern and western extremities, has Long Island on the south, the coast of Connecticut on the north, and that of West Chester county of New-York, on the west. Its outlines are numerously indented by bays of every form, and its surface diversified by many small islands which serve to beautify the view. The navigation of Long Island sound affords a most delightful excursion, as it combines both river and ocean scenery in the utmost perfection, without the dull monotony of the latter.\n\n**New Rochelle Landing.**\u2014The port of New Rochelle, a village of West Chester county, containing 800 inhabitants, a town hall, 3 churches, several boarding schools, button factory; and ink and carriage factories; many extensive hotels and boarding houses for the accommodation of the citizens of New York, many of whom spend the summer months here.\n\n**Stamford.**\u2014A beautiful town of Fairfield county, Connecticut, containing about 2,000 inhabitants.\n\n**Stratford Point.**\u2014A noted landing place in Fairfield county, Connecticut.\nNew-Haven Harbor.\u2014A bay of Long Island sound, at the head of which is the beautiful city of New Haven.\n\nFalkner's Islands.\u2014A small cluster of islands about 5 miles off the coast of New-Haven county.\n\nConnecticut River.\u2014This is the principal river of New England, which has its first fountain in Canada, and after passing southward and dividing the states of New-Hampshire and Vermont, and intersecting those of Massachusetts and Connecticut, enters Long Island sound about 30 miles east of New Haven. The entire course of this beautiful stream is marked by scenery of the most romantic and alluring description. It is diversified by hill and dale, and towards the north, it assumes an almost Alpine aspect, with every characteristic of the most rugged and mountainous regions. In approaching its discharge into the sound, it gradually declines and gently meanders through the green fields of Connecticut, to its final union with its great recipient, Long Island sound.\n\nRiver Thames.\u2014A small stream of the state of Connecticut, having the towns of New London and Norwich on its right bank; the former about 4, and the latter 20 miles from its mouth. This river forms a part of a route from New York to Boston, which will be noticed hereafter.\n\nStonington.\u2014An incorporated village of New London county, Connecticut, finely situated in the S.E. extremity of the state, and on the margin of the strait between the main land and Fisher's island. It contains about 1,500 inhabitants, many of whom are engaged in the whale and seal fisheries. Stonington became quite conspicuous during the late war with Great Britain. On the 10th of August, 1814, it was vigorously bombarded by a British fleet, which, however, was soon obliged to withdraw without accomplishing its object.\n\nHere the passengers for Boston leave the steamboat and enter the cars.\nKingston.\u2014A small village of Rhode island.\n\nProvidence.\u2014A large commercial and manufacturing city of Rhode Island, of which state it is the seat of government. It is advantageously situated on both sides of Providence river, a tributary of Narraganset bay. There are in the city and its dependencies not less than 4,000 buildings of every sort, including some elegant public and private structures. Among these are many handsome churches, and several edifices belonging to Brown's University, established in 1770. The arcade, 222 feet in length and 72 in breadth, built of stone, is a beautiful building; together with many others devoted to literary, scientific, and commercial purposes. The manufactures of Providence and its neighborhood, in which nearly one-fourth of the inhabitants are engaged, are vast and various; consisting chiefly of cotton goods of every variety, iron, copper and tin ware, and machinery of all kinds, jewelry, &c. Besides the railroads to Boston and Stonington, respectively, Providence enjoys the advantages of the Blackstone canal, which affords a navigable communication to Worcester, Mass. By the aid of these valuable auxiliaries, combined with excellent common roads, its domestic intercourse with the neighboring towns is largely promoted. Providence has also an extensive and valuable foreign commerce, especially with India and the islands of Oceana: this, however, has somewhat diminished of late, owing to the diversion of much of its capital to the purposes of domestic manufactures.\n\nBoston\u2014The great metropolis and capital of the state of Massachusetts, and the fifth city of the United States in point of population and extent. It is beautifully situated on a peninsula, which juts from the main land into Massachusetts bay; by which, and Charles river bay on the west, it is nearly surrounded. The former bay, which forms the harbor, is studded in every direction by several pretty islands, some of which are crowned with tasty structures and\nfortifications. These, with the numerous bridges extending from the city to the opposite shores and the adjacent villages, impart great beauty and interest to the entire landscape, when viewed from any of the neighboring eminences.\n\nThe city itself is somewhat irregular in its plan, and, with some exceptions, is disfigured by narrow and crooked streets. Those of a recent date are, however, laid out on a more commodious and liberal scale, and lined for the most part with elegant and substantial buildings. Among these, the following deserve notice: the Old State House, on Washington and State streets; State House, on Beacon street, in which the beautiful statue of Washington, by Chantry, is placed, and from the dome of which the city and its environs may be seen to great advantage; Faneuil Hall, in Dock square; Massachusetts Hospital, on the banks of Charles river; Faneuil Hall Market, and Quincy Hall, on Dock square, is an immense pile, 536 feet in length; Tremont House, on Beacon and Tremont streets, contains 180 apartments; New Court House, in Court square, 176 feet in length and 54 in width; Houses of Industry, Correction and Reformation, in South Boston; Trinity Church, in Sumner street; St. Paul's Church and Masonic Hall, in Tremont street; Washington Bank; Suffolk Bank, late United States Bank, in State street; Park street Church, &c.; Boston Theatre, now the \"Odeon,\" on Franklin and Federal streets, is now employed as a place of worship; Tremont Theatre, on Tremont street; National Theatre, corner of Travers and Portland streets.\n\nAmong the other objects of interest, in or around Boston, are the following:\n\nBoston Common, a public promenade, consisting of 75 acres of ground, surrounded by an iron railing, and ornamented with gravelled walks, trees, &c.\n\nMount Auburn Cemetery.\u2014A beautiful rural place of sepulture, is situated about 3 miles west of\nthe city. It comprises about 100 acres of land, which is appropriately arranged and adorned for the purposes to which it is devoted.\n\nBunker Hill Monument, in Charlestown; where are, also, the U. States Navy Yard, McLean Asylum for the insane, State Prison, &c. In South Boston, are Dorchester Heights, 130 feet above the adjacent bay, from which a fine view of Boston, &c. is had.\n\nRoute from New-York to Boston, via Norwich, by steamboat and railway.\n\nThames river, as above, .............. 125\nNew London, .................................. 4 129\nNorwich, ........................................ 16 145\nJewett's City, ................................... 9 154\nCanterbury ....................................... 6 160\nWestfield, ......................................... 12 172\nThompson, ....................................... 12 184\nOxford, ............................................ 10 194\nWorcester, ........................................ 10 204\nBoston, ............................................. 44 248\n\nNew London.\u2014A city, and one of the seats of justice for New London county, Conn. It is situated on the west bank of Thames river, and contains about 4,700 inhabitants, most of whom are engaged in the fishing business. The city is defended by two fortresses, one on each side of the river, which command the entrance. New London suffered severely during the revolutionary war. On the 6th of September, 1781, it was attacked by a British force of 24 vessels, under the renegade Arnold, and, after a slight resistance, succeeded in destroying a considerable portion of the city.\n\nNorwich.\u2014A beautiful and flourishing city of New London county, situated at the forks of Yantic and Shetucket rivers, the two principal branches of the\nThames. Its chief buildings are, a court house, a town hall, an academy. In Granville, a suburb of Norwich, are 3 extensive paper mills, besides 10 or 12 other factories, which produce cotton and woolen goods in large quantities, with many other articles. The falls of Shetucket deserve attention. Population of Norwich, according to the census of 1840, is 4,500.\n\nJewett's City.\u2014An extensive manufacturing village of New London county.\n\nCanterbury,\nWestfield, and\nThompson, are small villages of Windham county, Conn.\n\nOxford.\u2014A village of the township of the same name, in Worcester county, Mass.\n\nWorcester.\u2020\n\nBoston.\u2020\n\nRoute from New York to Boston, via Bridgeport, by steamboat and railroad.\n\nBridgeport, st. boat, 60 Canaan falls, R.R. 6 126\nNewtown, R.R. 20 80 W.

Since the completion of the Housatonic railroad, which commences here, the city has assumed quite a business-like appearance, and is now one of the most flourishing and handsome towns of the state.\n\nNewtown.\u2014A neat village of Fairfield county.\n\nNew Milford.\u2014A handsome little village of Litchfield county, Conn.\nKent.\u2014A village of Litchfield county, Conn., situated on the Housatonic river.\n\nCornwall.\u2014A village of the same county, romantically situated among the hills of Housatonic. A school for the instruction of Indians was established here in 1818, at which Obookiah, a native of Owyhee, was educated; but, ere he could return to his native country, he sickened and died. A neat monument to his memory may be seen in the village churchyard.\n\nCanaan falls.\u2014A beautiful cataract in the Housatonic river, occasioned by a ledge of limestone rocks, over which the water is precipitated, in an unbroken fall of 60 feet.\n\nWest Stockbridge.\u2020\u2014[Here the Housatonic railroad is intersected by the Albany and West Stockbridge railway, by which a practicable route from New York to Albany is furnished. The distance from New York to Bridgeport, by steamboat, is 60 miles, thence to West Stockbridge 94 miles, and thence to Albany 41 miles. Total distance from N. York to Albany 195 miles.]\n\nSpringfield.\u2020\n\nWorcester.\u2020\n\nBoston.\u2020\n\nRoute from New-York to Hartford, Conn.\n\nN.

New Haven has long been celebrated, not only as the seat of Yale College, one of the oldest and most distinguished schools of the country, but also for its numerous scientific and literary institutions; which, with the uncommon beauty of the city itself, and the general intelligence of the inhabi-\nants, render it one of the most attractive places in New England. Population 12,960.\n\nWallingford.\u2014A village of New Haven county, beautifully situated on an eminence about a mile east from the Quinnipiac. It consists of two parallel streets extending along the ridge of a hill. The main street, on which the most of the buildings are erected, is nearly a mile in length.\n\nMeriden.\u2014A manufacturing town of New Haven county. Here are produced, in great abundance, patent augers and auger bits, combs, tin and Britannia ware, iron castings, coffee mills, clocks, ironmongery, block tin ware, skates, rakes, &c.\n\nA short distance from the village is the famous Cat Hole, a narrow and romantic glen, through which a road has been constructed.\n\nHartford.\u2014A city, and one of the capitals of Connecticut, situated on the right or west bank of Connecticut river. The city plot is rather irregular, and is intersected by Little river, over which is a fine bridge. Another bridge across the Connecticut unites the city with East Hartford. Among the most prominent objects in the city are, the American Asylum for the instruction of the deaf and dumb; Retreat for the Insane; Washington College; and the Charter Oak, an old tree, of immense proportions, in the hollow of which was secreted, and thus preserved, in the year 1687, the original colonial charter, which had been demanded by the Governor General, with a view to its abrogation.\n\nCANADA.\n\nGENERAL VIEW.\n\nA vast territory of North America, belonging at present to Great Britain, lying in a N. E. and S. W. direction, principally along the N. side of the St. Law-\nrence, and the N. and E. sides of lakes Ontario, Erie, Huron, and Superior, between $57^\\circ 50'$ and $90^\\circ$ W. longitude, and $42^\\circ$ and $52^\\circ$ N. latitude. The other portion of Canada, or that on the S. side of the St. Lawrence, is of comparatively limited dimensions: it stretches along the river from near Montreal to Point Gasp\u00e9, at its embouchure, having on the S. the territory of the United States and New Brunswick. On the N. Canada has Labrador and the inhospitable territories belonging to the N. W. Company, the boundary in this direction being the elevated grounds, or water sheds, separating the rivers which run S. to the St. Lawrence and the great lakes from those which run N. to Davis' straits and Hudson's bay. The length of Canada, from Amherstburg, on Detroit river, the extreme S. W. limit of the province, to Sablon harbor, on the strait of Belle Isle, its extreme N. E. limit, is about 1,450 miles, its breadth may vary from 200 to 400 miles. Its area has been estimated at about 350,000 square miles; and its population at present probably exceeds a million. It is wholly within the basin of the St. Lawrence, of which it includes the entire N. and a small part of the S. slope.\n\nThis great territory, which is consolidated under one administration, is divided into two parts as formerly, but are designated as \"Canada West\" and \"Canada East,\" the former being identical with Upper, and the latter with Lower Canada. The Ottawa or Grand river, which has its sources in about $48^\\circ 30'$ N. latitude, and $80^\\circ$ W. longitude, and flows in an E. S. E. direction till it unites with the St. Lawrence, near Montreal, forms nearly in its whole extent the line of demarcation between the two provinces. Canada West is entirely an inland province; but from its having the great lakes and a part of the St. Lawrence for its boundary, it has a vast command of internal navigation, and a ready access to the ocean.\n\nThe N. portion of Canada consists of a table-land, little of which has been hitherto explored. In Can-\nada West, E. of Huron, it has an average elevation of perhaps from 1,200 to 1,300 feet. It is covered with forests interspersed with ravines, swamps, and torrents; and abounds with lakes which, anywhere but in the neighborhood of the immense lakes of this continent, would be deemed of considerable size. The coast of Canada East, N. E. of the Saguenay, is less lofty than S. W. of that river; but of a very uninviting description. The interior of this part of the country is described as composed of rocky cliffs and low hills, scattered over barren plains, diversified with thick forests of stunted pines, and checkered with small lakes. The greater part of the immense district of Quebec presents a chaos of mountains, lakes, and torrents, tenanted only by wild beasts, and a few wandering Indians. From the mouth of the Saguenay to Cape Tourment, near Quebec, the shore of the St. Lawrence is bold and desolate; but W. of this point a plain country begins to extend inland, with a variable breadth of from 15 to 40 miles, rising into the table-land behind it by successive terraces. The cultivated country N. of Quebec does not extend far, being hemmed in by hill ranges. But as these ranges gradually recede from the St. Lawrence, and the country, at first diversified by varied eminences, sinks into a level plain, the surface of settled and cultivated land increases; and this is especially the case as we approach and penetrate Canada West. The peninsula or great plain of this province, between lakes Huron, Erie, and Ontario, comprising about 20,000 square miles, consists, for the most part, of alluvial soil, on a calcareous substratum. It is of varying fertility; but, on the whole, is believed to be the best grain country of any of the more N. portions of the American continent. A large part of this fine plain is still covered with lofty forests: it has, however, some prairies, or natural meadows; but these are not extensive. At some remote period it had evidently formed part of the bed of a vast inland sea, of which\nthe five great lakes having been the deepest, are now the principal remaining portions. N. of lake Ontario, two terraces intervene between the plain on the shore of the lake and the table-land in the N., decreasing somewhat in fertility as they increase in height, and separated from each other and from the plain by two ranges of hills of moderate elevation. The most S. of these two ranges unite near longitude $80^\\circ$ with a third, which passes N. and S. from Natawasanga bay, in lake Huron, to the W. extremity of lake Ontario. The combined range, after encircling the head of the latter lake, crosses the bed of the Niagara river, forming the ledge over which are the celebrated falls, and is finally lost in the territory of the U. States.\n\nThat part of Canada East, S. of the St. Lawrence, extending between longitude $72^\\circ 30'$ and $74^\\circ 30'$, and entering into the district of Montreal, consists, for the most part, of an extended plain almost completely flat, except that some detached hills diversify the surface, one of which, that of Rouville, is 1,100 feet in height. It is less extensive than the plain on the opposite shore of the river, and contains no large towns, but it is in many districts equally fertile and well watered, and the cities are dependent on it for a large proportion of their supplies. To the S. and E. it ascends by degrees into the mountainous regions. The aspect of the S. shore of the estuary of the St. Lawrence, between longitude $69^\\circ 30'$ and $72^\\circ$, though bold and hilly, is not mountainous, as on the opposite shore: and the hill ranges are interspersed with valleys and even plains of some extent, many of which, from the encouragement afforded by the contiguous markets of the capital, have been brought into very tolerable cultivation. E. of Kamouraska, the country is diversified by more abrupt eminences, while population and culture become more limited; and in the district of Gasp\u00e9 the mountains rise into two chains of considerable elevation, enclosing between them a lofty table-land or central valley. The\nmost southerly of these chains bounds on its S. side the valley of the Ristigouche and St. John rivers.\n\nBesides the great lakes indenting the W. quiline of the count; y, Canada contains, as has been already said, numerous minor, yet still considerable, bodies of water. In Canada East, the lakes and rivers have been estimated to cover 3,200 square miles of surface; the principal of the former hitherto discovered are lake St. John, with an area of 540 square miles; those of Manicouagan, Piretibbe, and others N. of the St. Lawrence, and Mephramagog, &c., S. of that river. In Canada West, the chief known are Nipissing lake, Timiscaming and St. Ann's, in the high table-land; and the Simcoe lake in the upper terrace country of the Home district.\n\nAmongst the rivers falling into the St. Lawrence, or into the lakes which form part of its system, there are some deserving of especial mention here for their utility as regards navigation, or their agency in fertilizing the soil. In the peninsula of Canada West, the Thames originates in the district of London, by the union of several streams, near latitude 43\u00b0 and longitude 81\u00b0, and after a course of about 150 miles chiefly S. W. falls into lake St. Clair, situated between those of Huron and Erie. The Thames is navigable for large vessels to Chatham, 15 miles up, and for boats nearly to its source. It intersects and waters a fine and fertile country. Besides Chatham, small towns, with the pompous names of London and Oxford, are situated upon its banks. Next in magnitude to the Thames is the Ouse. This river rises in the Home district, about latitude 44\u00b0, longitude 80\u00b0 10', runs generally S. E., and falls into lake Erie near its N. E. extremity. Parallel to this river for about 50 miles, runs the Welland or Chippewa river, which in one part of its course forms a portion of the canal between the Ouse and lake Ontario, by means of which the falls of Niagara are avoided. The Trent, in the district of Newcastle, connects the small lakes\nBalsam, Sturgeon, and several others in the upper terrace country, with the Rice lake, and, after a tortuous course, discharges itself into the bay of Quint\u00e9, in lake Ontario. It is said to be navigable for boats in the whole of its course. The lake Balsam is separated by only a short portage from that of Simcoe, which discharges its waters into Gloucester bay (Huron lake) by the Severn river. A short and valuable line of direct water communication between the lakes Huron and Ontario is apparently impeded only by the intervention of this short portage, and by the rapids of the Severn, which river is, however, no more than 20 miles in length. If we except the St. John, the Ristigouche, which bounds the district of Gasp\u00e9 S., and falls into Chalour bay, is the only river of any importance in Canada not belonging to the St. Lawrence basin.\n\nClimate.\u2014The climate of Canada is subject to great extremes of heat and cold; the thermometer ranging between $10^{\\circ}$ above, and $36^{\\circ}$ below, the zero of Fahr. In such an extensive region there is, of course, some difference in this respect; as we ascend the St. Lawrence, not only a more S. parallel is reached, but the country is less wild and exposed than that near its entrance; so that whilst Quebec has been said to have the summer of Paris and the winter of St. Petersburg, the great plain of lake Erie has the climate of Philadelphia. Still the Canadian climate, as a whole, must be considered very severe: all the streams are locked up by ice, and the ground is covered everywhere, to an average depth of 5 or 6 feet, by snow, for 4 or 5 months of every year. Frosts usually commence in October, whilst the weather, by day, is still mild and serene. But with November begins a succession of snow-storms and tempests, from the N. and E., accompanied by a great increase of cold; and this sort of weather usually continues to the 2d or 3d week of December, when the atmosphere again becomes serene, but the cold still more\nintense, so that the rivers become suddenly frozen over. Towards the latter part of April, or, in late seasons, the beginning of May, the ice begins to break up (often with loud reports like the discharge of cannon;) a sudden increase of temperature stimulates vegetation, and makes its growth almost perceptible to the eye; so that spring and summer can scarcely be recognised as distinct seasons. May and June are occasionally wet, to the hinderance of the farmer, whose seed-time this is, (to be followed by harvest towards the end of August;) but usually, the summers are very fine. Thunder-storms are often of great violence, and the aurora borealis is frequent and vivid: of the prevailing winds, those from the S. W. are usually accompanied by clear and serene weather; those from the N. E. by continued rain in summer, and snow in winter; whilst a N. W. breeze is usually dry, with severe cold. Fogs (except in the district of Gasp\u00e9) are of unusual occurrence. It seems to be the general opinion of the inhabitants, that the winters are gradually becoming less severe: and this may be attributable to the clearance of the forests and the increased extent of cultivated surface; for, whilst the state of climate (especially of humidity) influences vegetation, that, in turn, reacts on climate. Humboldt's reasoning and tables (M\u00e9moires d'Arceuil, tom. iii.) may be satisfactorily referred to for the conditions that have the greatest and most permanent influence on the Canadian climate.\n\nThe length and severity of the Canadian winter is a heavy drawback on the country, and lays the farmer under serious difficulty and privations not experienced in countries where the climate is milder, as in the contiguous territories of Indiana and Illinois. For five or six months almost all agricultural operations are suspended, so that time is not left in the rest of the year for the proper preparation of the ground for the crops and other necessary labors. It is clear too, that horses, cattle, and other farm stock, must\nrequire a proportionally large supply of fodder for their keep. In these respects, however, there is a material difference between the two provinces. In Canada West the severity and the length of the winter are considerably diminished. The soil too is generally better; and the quality of the wheat improves as we draw nearer to the S. limit of the province.\n\nMost of the causes that contribute to make the climate of the northern part of America more severe, and subject to greater extremes than that of Europe, in the same parallel, bear with especial force on the Canadian regions. The greater portion of these provinces is covered by extensive forests; the trees composing which (especially in the more northern and eastern parts) do not, generally speaking, attain the same lofty size as those of the United States, nor flourish with the same exuberant vitality: the pine family, and various species of evergreens, are the most numerous and predominant. Amongst various other kinds of trees, are, the silver and American firs, Weymouth and Canadian pines, white cedar (*Thuja occidentalis*), maple, birch, American ash, bass wood, hickory, two or three species of wild cherry, and numerous species of oak. Like the rest of the American continent, most of the plants and animals differ specifically from those of the Old World. Many of the smaller kinds of annual and perennial plants are common to Canada and regions lying much further to the S., which may be accounted for by the high summer temperature, whilst the deep winter snows effectually protect their roots through the severest seasons; but the trees and larger shrubs, which find no such shelter, belong for the most part to more northern and arctic regions. Of the smaller plants, the *Zizania aquatica* may be noticed as peculiar to Canada, and abounding in most of the swamps (a grass not unlike rice, and affording food to birds, and occasionally to the Indian tribes,) and the ginseng, and Canadian lily, common to this country and Kamt.\nchatska. From the sap of the maple (*acer saccharinum,* ) as it rises in the earlier part of spring, sugar is made in considerable quantities; in collecting which, from trees scattered over thousands of acres, whilst the snow still covers the ground, much hardship is frequently endured: these districts are called sugaries, and a valuable description of property. The mode of procuring it is by inserting a small cane shoot through an incision made in the bark, the sap being received in a wooden trough placed under it; it is afterwards boiled, and left to cool into a hard solid mass, of a dark brown color, which is moulded by the form of the jars which contain it; the value of the article is about half of that produced from the sugar-cane. Most of the oak growing in the woods is unfit for ship-building, and the greater part of the timber used for that purpose is imported from New England. The species called the live oak, which grows in the warmer parts of the colony, is, however, said to be well adapted for ship timber; the various kinds of wood available for no other purpose, serve to supply the pot and pearl-ash manufactories. Amongst the wild animals ranging through these unreclaimed regions, are the American elk, fallow deer, bear, wolf, fox, wild cat, racoon, martin, otter, and various species of *Viverrae* and *Mustelae*; the beaver, hare, grey and red squirrel; and in the more southern parts, the buffalo and roebuck; the bears usually hibernate, if the season has enabled them to get sufficiently fat for the purpose; if not, they migrate to a more southerly climate. Amongst the birds, may be noticed the wild pigeon, quail, partridge, and different kinds of grouse; of the water birds, the species are very numerous, as might be inferred from the general character of the region, where, in the basin of the St. Lawrence, and the numerous lakes occupying the elevated table-lands around it, half the fresh water on the surface of the globe is collected; a humming bird (the smallest of its genus) is also indigenous, and may be seen in the\nQuebec gardens, fitting round the flowers. Amongst the reptiles, the rattlesnake is occasionally met with. Fish, in great variety and abundance, are found in the lakes and rivers; in which respect few streams can rival the St. Lawrence; the sturgeon is common, and the salmon and herring fisheries are considerable; seals are also met with occasionally, in large shoals, in the lower parts of the river. Forests can only exist where the prevailing winds bring with them sufficient moisture, but they may usually be taken as a measure of the fertility of the soil, no less than of the humidity of the climate: in this respect, therefore, taken generally, Canada must be considered a fertile region; the western province much more so than the eastern one. Tobacco, hemp, flax, and the different kinds of grain and pulse, are successfully cultivated; as are all the commoner fruits and vegetables of England; melons of different species abound, and are probably indigenous; as are also the strawberry and raspberry: these last flourish luxuriantly in the woods; and on the plains behind Quebec are gathered in great quantities, and taken to that market. Pears and apples succeed well, both there and at Montreal; and on the shores of Lake Erie, the grape, peach, and nectarine, as well as all the hardier kinds of fruit, arrive at the greatest perfection.\n\nCanada does not appear to be rich in minerals, but iron abounds in some districts; veins of silver-lead have been met with in St. Paul's Bay (50 miles below Quebec,) and coals, salt, and sulphur, are also known to exist in the colony. No volcanos have been discovered, but authentic accounts are preserved of several violent earthquakes: amongst others, one in 1663, when tremendous convulsions, lasting for six months, extending from Quebec to Tadoussac (130 miles below it,) which broke up the ice of the rivers, and caused many great land-slips and dislocations; in 1791, earthquakes were also frequent and violent, in the same region; and the shores, both of\nthe gulf and river St. Lawrence present many proofs of former convulsions in the horizontal banks of recent shingle and shells, and in elevated lime-stone strata, with wave-scooped marks, and lithodomous perforations, that occur on various parts of the shores.\n\nPeople.\u2014The majority of the population in East Canada are of French origin, and are for the most part descendants of settlers from Normandy, established in the colony previously to 1759. Their number at that period was about 70,000, and in 1831 they had increased (according to the census) to upwards of 400,000; the most rapid augmentation probably of any on record from births alone. Neither the conquest, nor the long period which has since elapsed, has wrought any great change in their character and habits; nor has their increasing numbers induced them to make any considerable encroachments on the wilderness around: on the contrary, they have continued within their original limits, subdividing the land more and more, and submitting to a constantly decreasing ratio of comfort. They are frugal, honest, industrious, and hospitable, but cling with unreasoning tenacity to their ancient prejudices and customs; by temperament, cheerful, social, engaging, and (from the highest to the lowest) distinguished for courtesy and real politeness, they retain all the essential characteristics of the French provinces under the ancient regime, and present the spectacle of an old, uneducated, stationary society, in a new and progressive world. A few seignorial families possess large, but not very valuable properties: the class wholly dependent on wages is a very small one; and the great majority consists of a hard-working yeomanry (usually called habitans,) amongst whom there is almost a universal equality of condition and property. From the public colleges and seminaries established in the cities and other central points by the early possessors of the country, chiefly by the Jesuits (where the education resembles that of our public grammar-schools, and is\nentirely in the hands of the Catholic clergy,) between 200 and 300 annually finish their education, and are dispersed through the community: nearly the whole of these are of the class of habitans, and return to reside amongst them, mostly as notaries or surgeons; and thus, living on terms of complete social equality, though with greatly superior knowledge, in communities which possess nothing in the shape of municipal institutions, they possess almost despotic influence over popular opinion and conduct in all public matters. The habitans under the old feudal tenures have cleared two or three belts of land along the St. Lawrence, and cultivate them on the worst system of small farming; their farms and residences being all so connected, that the country of the seignories appears like a continuous village. They spin and weave their own wool and flax, and make their own soap, candles, and sugar. What energy and enterprise there exists in the community (beyond the portion required by this sort of routine) is exerted in the fur trade and in hunting.\n\nThe Anglo-Saxon portion of the population of Canada East consists almost wholly of persons who have emigrated from the United Kingdom, or the descendants of such, subsequent to 1759. A considerable addition was made to their numbers by U. S. loyalists in 1787; at a subsequent period many families from Vermont have settled in the townships adjoining that state, and since the formation of the American Land Company many have emigrated through their exertions. A majority of the laboring class in this portion of the population are Irish Catholics; the rest are English or Scotch Protestants: besides this, they possess the best cultivated farms in the province, and are owners of fully half the more valuable seignories. The inhabitants of the W. province consist principally of the descendants of U. S. loyalists, previously to 1787, and of subsequent settlers, or their descendants, from the United Kingdom and the states;\nan extensive emigration from the former, subsequent to 1828, nearly doubled the previous population of the province. Of the emigrants from the United Kingdom, many were half-pay army or navy officers, and of the working classes a considerable proportion were Irish. The Catholic population of the western province is estimated at one fifth part of the whole: in the back part of the Niagara district some Dutch settlers are established; and a few French families along the Detroit. The population at present is estimated at 500,000, scattered along an extensive frontier, with very imperfect means of inter-communication; the more thickly settled districts being, of course, in the occupation of the older section of residents, who are for the most part owners also of the wild lands in those districts. The number of emigrants from the United Kingdom, which landed at the port of Quebec in the nine years ending 1838, amounted to 263,089; of these, 165,000 proceeded to the western province; but of the whole number, from 50 to 60 per cent., re-emigrated, after a short residence, to the U. States. The greatest number which emigrated in any one year was in 1832, when 51,746 arrived at Quebec; the smallest number was in 1838, when 4,992 only reached that port. Within the period spoken of there were also 50,000 estimated to have reached the provinces by way of New York and the Erie canal; a like proportion of whom also re-emigrated.\n\nThere can be no doubt that the valley of the Mississippi offers incomparably greater advantages to industrious immigrants, whether with or without capital, than can be enjoyed in any part of Canada. It has a better climate, a better and cheaper soil, and is free from the greater number of those social grievances that disturb and embitter society in Canada. The wonder, in fact, is, not that so many of the emigrants to Canada have left it for the United States, but that any considerable portion of them should have remained behind.\nThe native Indian tribes still occupy portions of this colony on lakes Superior and Huron, and along the whole extent towards the north boundaries; but their numbers are rapidly diminishing, and they are fast degenerating from their original spirit and character, so that the utter extinction of the race seems inevitable, as civilization advances on the wilderness, to which, only, they appear to be adapted. Various attempts have been made, from 1776, downward, to settle and instruct them in agriculture and the arts, but with very little success. There are five of these settlements in the eastern province; the number of Indians at which is estimated at 3,437, the most numerous being the Iroquois and Algonquins. Those of the Six Nations (who were the firm allies of the British in the first American war) are estimated at 2,149; the Mohawks of the Bay of Quint\u00e9 337; the other tribes at 6,428; they occupy tracts along the rivers St. Clair, Aux Sables, Detroit, Thames, Ous\u00e9, and Credit; lakes Simcoe, Rice, Mud, and Balsam, and Point Peter; the great Manitouwunning (containing about 1,000,000 acres) is also appropriated to Indians who choose to settle. The lands are held under the crown in joint tenancy to them and their posterity, and are not allowed to be leased or sold without its consent. Besides the above, there are other tribes round the shores of lake Michigan, and the south side of lake Superior (about 2,000 in all,) who consider themselves as owing allegiance to the British crown, and attend to receive presents annually: there are also many tribes on the north sides of lakes Huron and Superior, who consider that vast tract their own, and occupy it as hunting-grounds. Large sums have been expended by religious societies in futile efforts to improve them; and the Indian department of government has occasionally cost 150,000l in a single year: the object of the last, however, has rather been to make the services of the Indians available in war, than with a view to their permanent im-\nprovement; the Hudson's Bay and Canada companies have, also, not scrupled to employ them in the same way; and it is stated, that without a change of system in both respects the fate of the Indians is sealed. But the truth is, that, however it may be changed, their fate is sealed.\n\nDistribution and Tenure of Lands in the Eastern Province, Government, &c.\u2014About 1-38th part of the area of the province is estimated to be under some sort of cultivation. The extent of land surveyed in each district, down to 10th July, 1838, was\u2014in the Montreal district, 2,286,750 acres; Three Rivers, 2,098,908 do.; Quebec, 1,383,666 do.; Gasp\u00e9 400,639 do.; making a total of 6,169,963 statute acres. This is divided in townships averaging about 70,000 square acres, and is exclusive of an allowance of 5 per cent. for highways, and of a block of land, set off for the British American Land Company, in the county Sherbrook, district of Three Rivers, containing 585,089 acres. The land comprised in the seignorial districts amounts to about 8,300,000 acres; of this last, the whole has been granted by the crown, subject to an obligation to concede to actual settlers, and 4,300,000 acres have been thus conceded. Of the township land 3,500,000 acres have been disposed of \"for other than public purposes.\" The grants made by the French government previously to the conquest, were on one uniform system. Seignories (or manors containing from 9 to 36 square leagues) were created in favor of certain leading individuals, who were bound to grant or \"concede\" a specified portion to any applicant; the profit, to the seignor, being derived from payment of a small rent, from services which the censitaire (or tenant) was bound to perform; from 1-12th of the corn ground (by compulsion) at the seignorial mill; and from a fine on the transference of the property (other than by inheritance.)\nSince the province came under the British government, the plans under which land has been granted and sold have differed very widely at different periods; but have very rarely, indeed, been established on sound principles. The township lands have been granted in many modes, differing both in their character and object: at first, they were granted to settlers in free and common socage, with a reservation to resume all, or any part, if required for military purposes, but subject to no other conditions: the quantity so granted to each individual, being limited to 100 acres for himself, and 50 acres additional for each member of his family; the governor having authority to increase this amount, by 1,000 acres. These favorable terms were meant to attract settlers from the colonies, which now form the United States. In 1775 this arrangement was superseded, and the Quebec Act of the preceding year having restored the French code and language, corresponding instructions were given, that future grants should again be made in fief and seignory, and three seignories were thus created. In 1791 the regulations of 1763 were revived, though with certain conditions annexed to them, which in practice were avoided; and this mode continued till 1826; but the constitutional act of 1791 also enacted that a reserve for the support of the Protestant clergy should be made, in respect of every grant, equal in value, as near as could be estimated, to 1/7th part of the land granted. The crown reserves to a like extent, originated in the view of supplying, first by sales and ultimately by rents, an independent source of revenue, and obviating the necessity of taxes, and consequently of such disputes as had led to the Independence of the United States. These reserves, however, have proved most serious obstacles to the welfare of the colony, which the mis-construction or violation of the act has aggravated, by increasing their extent beyond what appears to have been contemplated. From 1806, downward, no new town-\nships were granted; and the grants, on to 1814, were in lots of 200 acres, to actual settlers; and few in number. From the last date, grants were made on \"location tickets,\" requiring the erection of a house, and the clearing and cultivating 4 acres, before the title was perfected. In 1826 the new mode of selling land by auction, at a minimum upset price, was adopted, the purchase money being payable by four annual instalments, without interest. In 1831, the purchase-money was to be repaid by half-yearly instalments; and in 1837, the purchase-money was made payable at the time of sale: but in practice this has not been effected. Besides the grants made under these different regulations, other exceptional ones have been made\u2014mostly in reward of public services; such as those to the militia of the revolutionary war, and of that of 1812\u2014many valid claims in these respects still remaining to be settled: there has also been an exceptional sale of nearly 800,000 acres to the British North American Land Company. The crown reserves must be considered as virtually abandoned when the auction sales were introduced; and an act of the imperial legislature has authorized the sale of 1-4th part of the clergy reserves, at a rate not exceeding 100,000 acres annually. In these various ways, about 3,500,000 acres have been disposed of.\n\nThe amount received on the sales of crown land in the lower province, from 1828 to 1837 inclusive, was \u00a333,853; on clergy reservers, \u00a350,425; timber duties, \u00a358,085. In the upper province for the same period, crown lands, \u00a333,853; clergy reserves, \u00a3114,618; timber duties, \u00a358,085. The timber is chiefly red and white pine and oak.\n\nEach district has its own judges, whose jurisdiction (except Gasp\u00e9) is independent of the others, and only subject to the court of appeal. A sheriff is also appointed for each district, and grand voyer, or general inspector of the roads. These appear to be the only characteristics; but as respects judicial affairs, Gasp\u00e9\nis dependent on Quebec; and the roads of St Francis are surveyed by the grand voyers of Montreal and Three Rivers. The subdivisions of these districts are counties, townships, parishes, and extra-parochial places; that of Montreal has 19, Quebec 13, Three Rivers 5, St. Francis 3, and Gasp\u00e9 2 counties, respectively. The parishes and townships are merely divisions for such local purposes as the repairs of roads, inspection of fences, water-courses, &c.; each is subdivided into sections (not exceeding ten;) the parishes vary much in extent, and those which are Catholic, also serve for limits, in the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of that church: the townships usually enclose a square of 10 miles. There are in all 175 seignories, 33 fiefs, and 160 townships. The cities of Quebec and Montreal were incorporated under temporary acts, which have been allowed to expire without renewal: these were the only municipal corporations in the province. In the Catholic parishes, churchwardens are appointed, and in some localities, \"a council of notables,\" to manage the secular affairs of the church, and what are called the funds of \"the fabrique,\" under old French ordinances, so doubtful and contradictory, as to cause frequent litigation. The income of their clergy is derived from the 26th bushel of all grain grown by the parishioners; this, however, is contingent on the proprietor being a Catholic. When an estate passes into Protestant hands, this right is lost; and hence the natural aversion of the priests to any Protestant settlements being made within their seignories; nor is there any provision for the Catholic clergy, in the event of any part of the French population settling beyond the seignories, which, no doubt, has had some effect in confining it within their limits. There are 44 clergymen, and 53 churches and chapels, finished and in progress.\n\nThere is also a Catholic bishop of Quebec, paid by the government out of certain public revenues, and under him a body of secular clergy, for the seignories\nand some female monastic establishments. The Protestant dissenters have places of worship, and ministers in various parts of the province.\n\nFor the relief of mariners, a duty of a penny a ton is levied on every vessel arriving from any port out of the limits of the province; the portion received at Quebec goes to support the marine hospital there, which was built by a public grant; that received at Montreal goes to the general hospital of that city; various acts have also passed to establish depots for the relief of shipwrecked mariners. There are four such at Anticosti, one near Cape Chat, and another at Magdalen river.\n\nThe governor and principal officers of the government are appointed by the crown, and hold their appointments during pleasure. The chief of these are, the assistant civil secretary, provincial secretary and registrar, receiver-general, inspector-general of accounts, &c.; there are also 6 collectors of customs, 3 judges at Quebec, and 3 at Montreal; with numerous other functionaries. There is also an unpaid magistracy, appointed by the crown, who are required to possess immovable property, beyond all liabilities, of at least \u00a3300 currency; and commissioners who sit in the small cause courts, which are held weekly in the cities, and on the first and third Saturday of each month in the rural districts, with power of adjournment. As regards the superior courts of justice, the judges residing in each district have supreme jurisdiction. Trial by jury was introduced, with the rest of the criminal and civil law of England, in 1763; the jurics were, at first, exclusively taken from the cities, and subsequently (by a government order) were selected by the sheriffs, from these, and from the adjacent country, for 15 leagues around.\n\nThe external trade of Canada is carried on through the medium of the ports of Quebec, Montreal, St. John's, Coteau du Lac, and Stanfield. From the U. Kingdom, Canada imports coals, metals, cordage,\nEast India produce, and various kinds of British manufactures; from the British West India colonies, sugar, molasses, rum, coffee, and hard-woods; from the United States, beef, pork, biscuit, rice, and tobacco. Owing to the unjust and oppressive preference given to Canadian timber in the markets of Great Britain, it forms by far the principal article of export from the colony. The next article is corn, especially wheat, which, however, is supposed to be mainly derived from the United States; and then follow ashes, furs, fish, &c. In 1834 the total value of the exports from Canada amounted to \u00a31,018,922. The imports chiefly consist of cottons, woolens, silks, linens, glass, hardware, coal, &c. Their total value in 1834 was \u00a31,063,645. The total revenue derived from taxes in 1836 amounted to \u00a3102,027.\n\nCanada was ceded by France to England in 1763: it had previously been governed by French military authority; from thence, to 1774, it was under the rule of an English governor and council, with English law, administered in the English language only. From 1774 to 1791 it was governed by an English governor and a legislative council, appointed by the crown, with English criminal, and French civil law; and from 1791 downward, by the constitution sanctioned by the British Parliament. The Quebec Act of 1774 introduced a new and liberal policy. In order to conciliate the colonists, it substituted the old system of civil law, or that called the Coutume de Paris, for the civil law of England, and it directed the use of the French language to be resumed in the law courts. Notwithstanding these concessions, the French in Canada are now almost as much a distinct people as in 1760. The Nation Canadienne has no sympathy, and but little communication with Englishmen: on the contrary, a broad line of demarcation and a deep-rooted antipathy subsists between them. To this hostile feeling on the part of the French colonists, may be fairly ascribed the\noutbreak that took place in Canada, and the subsequent suppression of the constitution, and the occupation of the country by British troops.\n\nDistribution of Ground.\u2014The surveyed portion of West Canada comprises 17,653,544 acres, in 11 districts, and between 300 and 400 townships. Wheat and tobacco are the chief exports. Of the surveyed lands 450,000 acres are reserved for roads; 2,395,687 acres are clergy reserves; 13,660,838 have been granted and appropriated, and there remain for future grants, 1,147,019 acres. About 1-48th part of the area is considered to be under cultivation. The modes of granting have been the same as those in the lower province. The crown and clergy reserves have also been made on the same principle as those of Canada East; in two cases the government has delegated the disposal of its waste lands to others; the district of Talbot (48,500 acres) to Col. Talbot; and the crown reserves (1,384,413 acres) and a block of land in the Huron district, (1,100,000 acres) to the \"Canada Company;\" about 1-30th part of the granted land is under cultivation.\n\nA small tax, not exceeding 1d. in the pound, is levied both on cultivated and waste lands; the former being valued at 20s. the acre, the latter at 4s. The whole amount of taxation of a farm of 100 acres, in the western province, is about 18s. This tax began to be levied by the provincial government in 1820. If 8 years are in arrear, the sheriff is authorised to sell; but this has been done only in a few instances, when the owners allowed it as the cheapest and easiest way of making a title to the rest of their land. The number of churches built, or in progress, connected with the Church of England, is about 90; the number of clergymen 73; the number of followers are estimated at 150,000, by the Bishop of Montreal, within whose diocese the province is included, and under him are the archdeacons of York and Kingston. The Presbyterians of the Scotch church, the\nCatholics, and the Wesleyans, are the other chief sects; the latter are said to out-number any of the rest. The ministers of the Church of Scotland are supported partly by stipends from the government, partly by their respective congregations; the Catholics have a bishop, who resides at Toronto, and who also receives an annual grant from the government to aid in the maintenance of himself and priesthood; the ministers of the other sects are wholly supported by their congregations. By the Constitutional Act of 1791, reserves of land were set apart in this, as in the eastern province, for the maintenance of the \"Protestant clergy\".\n\nHistory.\u2014Canada is said to have been first discovered by Sebastian Cabot, in 1497; if so, it was comprised with the rest of the extensive line of coast he explored, under the general name of Newfoundland, subsequently limited to the island so called. The French first attempted to make those discoveries available, and are said to have framed a map of the gulf so early as 1508. In 1525 the country was taken possession of in the name of the king of France, and in 1535 Cartier explored the river, naming it St. Lawrence, from having entered it on that saint's day. Quebec, however, the first settlement, was not founded till 1608. For a considerable period subsequent to this the colonists appear to have been engaged in a series of sanguinary conflicts with the native Indian tribes, and to have been often on the brink of being extripated: the strife, however, ultimately terminated in a friendly compact, which converted the Indians into available auxiliaries against the English. Quebec was taken by the British forces under General Wolf, in 1759, and the whole territory formally ceded by the Treaty of Paris, in 1763. The seignorial rights, the various holdings and tenures under them, and the endowments of the Catholic church, were left undisturbed: and all the estates, including all the unappropriated lands in the province, held at the\nperiod by the French king, became vested in the British crown. In the years 1812-13-14, the lakes, and especially the shores of Niagara, were the scene of a succession of severe contests; and the militia on either side being engaged in them, near relatives were found often contending in opposite ranks, so that common was aggravated to civil warfare; and Indians also were employed, and increased its horrors. The grievances and complaints of Canada first obtained the attention of parliament in 1828, when a select committee of the H. of C. reported on them. The legislative assembly's claims were,\u2014the right of appropriating all the crown revenues as they pleased, and also all those accruing from parliamentary and provincial statutes, and the settlement and alienation of all the wild lands of the province; but the most important point, without which the rest would be conceded in vain, according to their statement, was, that the legislative council should be elected by the people, and thus assimilated to the senate of the United States. Another H. of Commons report led to the nomination of Lord Gosford (who was also appointed governor) and two other commissioners, and five reports and appendixes, published in 1837, are the only result of their labors. In the divisions which took place in the House of Assembly, the British party divided from 8 to 11 in house of 88 members. The grievances of the western province were set forth in the report of a committee of their House of Assembly, who adopted it, and laid it before the king. The extent and abuse of the crown patronage; the virtual irresponsibility of the executive; the mode of conducting the business of the provincial post-office; the management of the Toronto College; the provision made for the ecclesiastical establishment, and for the maintenance of certain sects only (the House say they \"recognise no particular denomination as established in Canada with exclusive claims, powers, or privileges\"); the partiality shown in the choice of magistrates; the\nabsence of control over the crown revenues; and the failure on the part of the local, to carry into effect the recommendations of the general government, are the most prominent of the grievances set forth. Subsequent to this, Sir F. Head replaced Sir J. Colborne as governor, in 1836; and during his government the outbreak under Mackenzie and others took place; which ultimately led to the suppression of the constitution, and the union of the two provinces under one government.\n\nMONTREAL.\n\nA town and river port of British America, and the second city and chief seat of the commerce of East Canada; on the S. side of the island of Montreal, in the St. Lawrence, 150 miles in a direct line S. W. of Quebec; lat. 45\u00b0 30' W., long. 73\u00b0 25' N. Population, with its suburbs, in 1840, 27,297. Its site is not so commanding as that of Quebec, but it is in every other respect superior to that city. It is not so crowded; and some even of its oldest streets are of tolerable breadth. Montreal is divided into the Upper and the Lower Town; the difference in their elevation is but slight, but the former being the more modern is the handsomer division. It has several suburbs, including which it stretches along the river for 2 miles from N. to S., and has for some distance a nearly equal breadth inland. The battlemented wall with which it was formerly surrounded, has long fallen into decay, and it is now entirely open, the wooded heights around being covered with villas and pleasure grounds. In the Lower Town, Paul street, the chief commercial thoroughfare, extends parallel with the river the whole length of the city; and in the Upper Town several streets proceed in the same direction, communicating with Paul street by cross streets. In the Upper town and suburbs, which are mostly inhabited by the principal merchants, many of\nthe houses are handsomely and solidly built in the modern style; but in the Lower town they are principally of a gloomy looking grey stone, with dark iron window-shutters and tinned roofs. Along the bank of the river is an extensive line of quays and warehouses. Many of the houses in the suburbs are built of wood, but there are no wooden buildings within the space once encompassed by the walls; and this city and Quebec have more of the aspect of old European towns than any other towns in America.\n\nThe most remarkable public edifice is the Roman Catholic cathedral, opened in 1829, and superior to any other church in British America. It is of Gothic architecture, 255\u00bd feet in length by 134\u00bd in breadth. It is faced with stone, and roofed with tin, and has 6 towers, of which the three belonging to the main front are 220 feet in height. On the roof is a promenade, 76 feet in length by 20 in breadth, elevated 120 feet. The principal window is 64 feet in height, and 32 in breadth. The interior is capable of accommodating from 10,000 to 12,000 persons, who may disperse by numerous outlets in 5 or 6 minutes. It comprises 7 chapels, and 9 spacious aisles. There are several other Roman Catholic churches, mostly belonging to the order of St. Sulpice; to the members of which Montreal chiefly owed its foundation, and who still hold the seignory of the island upon which it stands.\n\nThe seminary of St. Sulpice, a large and commodious building adjoining the cathedral, occupies three sides of an oblong area, 132 feet in length by 29 deep, and is surrounded by spacious gardens. A handsome additional building, 210 feet by 45 feet, has been lately erected, at an expense of \u00a310,000. In these establishments, students in most of the higher branches of learning are taught at very moderate charges. The principal English church is a handsome building, in the Grecian style, surmounted by a high and beautiful spire. It has also a Scotch kirk, an American Protestant church, and chapels belong-\ning to the Methodists and Scotch dissenters. The Montreal General Hospital, erected in 1821-2 by voluntary subscription, a large and well-built edifice, is said to be one of the best regulated institutions of the kind in America. A large conventual structure, the H\u00f4tel Dieu, occupied by a superior, matron and thirty-six nuns, is appropriated to the reception of the sick and indigent; and the convent of the Grey Sisters partly serves as an asylum for the aged and infirm, the insane, foundlings, &c.\n\nThe Soeurs Noires, have an extensive convent, founded in 1630; its inmates consist of a superior and 60 nuns, whose duties are directed to the education of young girls. The court-house and prison are substantial buildings, occupying the site of the former college of the Jesuits. The government house, bank, barracks, ordnance office, and market-houses are among the remaining principal buildings. In one of the squares is a colossal statue of Nelson, placed on a Doric column, the pedestal of which has bas-reliefs representing his principal actions. Besides the educational establishments noticed above, Montreal has a college, with a principal and 4 professors, a royal grammar school, parochial, union, national, Sunday, and other public schools; and many good private French and English seminaries. The university of McGill college, endowed by a citizen of Montreal, in 1814, with a valuable estate, and \u00a310,000 in money, was chartered in 1821, and is conducted on a liberal and enlarged scale. Montreal has a penitentiary, a house of industry, a savings bank, a natural history society, a mechanics' institution, a central auxiliary society for promoting education and industry, bible and tract, agricultural and horticultural societies, several public libraries, an excellent news-room, &c. Several newspapers and other periodical publications issue from the presses of the town. The position of Montreal at the head of the ship navigation of the St. Lawrence, and near the confluence of that river with the Ottawa,\nas well as its situation with respect to the United States, necessarily make it one of the greatest emporiums of America.\n\nThe harbor, though not large, is secure, and vessels drawing 15 feet water may lie close to the shore. Its general depth of water is from 3 to 4\u00bd fathoms. Its chief disadvantage consists in the rapid of St. Mary's about 1 mile below, which vessels often find it difficult to stem. To obviate the obstructions in the navigation above Montreal, the La Chine canal, 9 miles long, 20 feet wide, and 5 feet in depth, was undertaken in 1821, and completed at an expense of \u00a3130,000. The communication with the opposite sides of the river is carried on by several steam and other vessels; and during the summer, a regular steamboat communication is kept up with Quebec. At this season, vast rafts of timber come down, and pass the city for Quebec; and scows, bateaux of about 6 tons, and Durham boats, bring to Montreal the produce of the Upper Country. Neither is the trade of Montreal suspended in winter, like that of Quebec. Thousands of sledges may then be seen coming in from all directions with agricultural produce, frozen carcasses of beef and pork, firewood and other articles. Montreal is the centre of the commerce between Canada and the United States, carried on by Lake Champlain and the Hudson; and not only is it the depot of all the adjacent country, but most of the business done in Quebec is carried on by branches from the Montreal houses. In 1838, 98 ships, of the aggregate burden of 92,989 tons, entered, and 99 ships, burden 21,901 tons, left the port. Formerly this city was the head quarters of the fur trade, but its interest in it has greatly declined. It has, however, cast-iron foundries, distilleries, breweries, soap, candle and tobacco manufactories, several ship building establishments, and machinery for steam-engines. Various articles of hardware, linseed oil, floor-cloth, &c., are made in the town. The markets are abundantly supplied with\ngood butchers' meat, fish, poultry, fruit, vegetables, &c. About three-fourths of the population are of French descent; the remainder, consisting principally of emigrants from the United Kingdom, Americans, and Iroquois Indians. Montreal, originally called Villemarie, was taken from the French, in 1760.\n\nThe environs of Montreal also present many objects worthy a stranger's attention: as the \"Mountain,\" La Chine Canal, and the Rapids, which it is designed to overcome: those of the Cedres, &c.; indeed the entire island is replete with interesting objects, an inspection of which will amply repay the time devoted to it; and, more remote, are the celebrated Caledonia Springs, which, though known and resorted to by the Indians of the neighborhood for many years past, have but lately received that attention from the public which their medicinal and healing qualities demand. They are situated about 70 miles nearly due west from Montreal, at the head of a small affluent of the Ottawa, in Caledonia township, where a town has been laid off, and buildings erected for the accommodation of visiters. The chief of these springs are designated as the \"white sulphur,\" \"saline\" and \"gas\" springs, respectively. The latter emits an inflammable gas, probably carburetted hydrogen, which answers the purpose of lighting some of the buildings. The route commonly taken from Montreal to the springs, is by the villages of St. Eustache, Point Fortune, Hawkesbury, L'Original, &c. A water route, which increases the distance somewhat, is afforded by the Ottawa, which conducts to L'Original, whence passengers are conveyed in stages, a distance of 8 miles, to the springs.\n\nRoute from Montreal to Quebec, by steamboat.\n\nOn leaving Montreal, the first village that presents itself is Boucherville, nearly opposite the lower suburb of Montreal; which, like most of the villages that lie\nthe shores of the St. Lawrence, presents a remarkably neat appearance. Indeed the entire bank is occupied by a continued succession of villages, with their churches and tin covered houses, or cottages, which add life and animation to the natural scenery, which is beautiful to a high degree. The rapids of St. Mary's, about 2 miles below the city, serve to increase the speed of the steamer, which soon reaches Varennes.\u2014A beautiful village, nearly opposite the north point of Montreal island. Ten miles farther on is St. Sulpice, then Valtrie, both on the left. After proceeding some 5 or 6 miles, the pretty little town of Noraye comes in view; it is on the left bank of the St. Lawrence, which is here broken by several small islands, nearly opposite to which is William Henry, a small fortress situated at the confluence of the Richlieu, the outlet of lake Champlain, with the St. Lawrence. Immediately on leaving William Henry, Lake St. Peter is entered through a perfect labyrinth of islands. It is an expansion of the St. Lawrence, about 10 miles in width, and 20 in length. The rivers St. Francis and Yamasca enter it from the south-east. At the mouth of the latter is the neat village of Yamasca; then follow those of Baie, St. Isabelle, and Gregoire, all on the right bank of the lake; which, at the latter village, contracts to the width of one mile. Point du Lac, another pretty village, is situated at the point where the St. Lawrence emerges from the lake, and from which is seen the ancient town of Three Rivers, the half-way station between Montreal and Quebec. This town, which is third in point of size in Canada, is situated on the north bank of the St. Lawrence, where it is joined by the St. Maurice. It derives its name from two small islands at the mouth of the St. Maurice, which divides it into three channels; but the town is on the west bank of that river. The situation is pleasant, though the town itself, which is one of the oldest in Canada, is less attractive. It contains about 450 dwelling houses,\nmostly built of wood; a handsome court-house, a jail, a Catholic and a Protestant church, an Ursuline convent, founded in 1677, and some other public edifices. Here the courts of justice for the district are held; and here, at one period, a great share of the fur trade centered; but its general trade has been mostly absorbed by Quebec and Montreal. Three Rivers was once the capital of Canada. Its population is about 4,000, mostly descendants of French, and the names of its streets are nearly all derived from those of Paris. It is 96 miles from Montreal, and 84 from Quebec. Ten miles below Three Rivers, on the left, is the village of Champlain, and 4 miles beyond is that of Batiscan. St. Pierre next presents itself on the right, and then St. Anne on the left; these are succeeded by Grondines on the left, Lotbiniere on the right, and Dechambault on the north bank; all remarkably neat little hamlets, united together by a string of white cottages, equally neat in their appearance. About 7 miles below the latter, situated on the south bank of the river is St. Croix, and immediately opposite, is the village of Cape Sante; thence to St. Augustine on the left and St. Nicolas on the right is about 18 miles. The new town of Liverpool is next reached, from which Quebec is in full view. The fact of the near approach to a large city, is made abundantly evident by the improved appearance of the cottages and seats which line both banks of the river, increasing in number as the city is approached.\n\nQUEBEC.\n\nThe city of Quebec is situated on the left or north-west bank of the St. Lawrence, at the point where it is intersected by the St. Charles, about 350 miles from the mouth of the former. By a late census it was found to contain 27,562 inhabitants, but its population may be estimated at 30,000. The city oc.\noccupies the extremity of a ridge, terminating in the angle formed by the junction of the two rivers, in the point called Cape Diamond, rising to the height of nearly 340 feet above the St. Lawrence. The cape is surmounted by the citadel; and the town extends from it, principally in a N.E. direction, down to the water's edge. It is divided, from the difference of elevation, into the Upper and Lower towns. The old town, which lies wholly without the walls, partly at the foot of Cape Diamond and round to the St. Charles, has narrow and dirty, and, in parts, steep streets. The ascent from the Lower to the Upper town, which crosses the line of the fortifications, is by a winding street, and by flights of steps. The streets in the latter, though rather narrow, are generally clean, and tolerably well paved, or macadamised. Both towns are wholly built of stone; and the public buildings, and most of the houses in the Upper town, are roofed with tin plates, the glitter of which, in the sun, has a brilliant and striking effect, but is destructive of every thing that Europeans have been accustomed to call grand and venerable. In the Lower town the houses are mostly covered with shingles.\n\nPUBLIC BUILDINGS, &c.\n\nQuebec Exchange, situated at the east end of St. Paul street, is a fine stone structure, having a reading room 50 by 30 feet in the second, and a public library in the third stories. The Quebec Board of Trade have apartments on the same floor with the library. Several capacious warehouses have lately been erected.\n\nTrinity House, near the Exchange, is occupied by an incorporated body, who is charged with the supervision and regulation of the pilots who navigate the river.\nCustom House, is a neat stone edifice, well adapted to the purposes to which it is devoted. Adjoining the Custom House is the\n\nKing's Wharf, used as a place of landing and embarkation of the troops, &c. The immense warehouse of the commissary stands near the wharf.\n\nH\u00f4tel Dieu, one of the most extensive buildings in Canada, is situated between Hope and Palace gates. It is 390 feet in length, 51 in width, and 3 stories high, with a wing on the N. W. side 2 stories high and 150 feet long. There are several fine pictures here, chiefly by French artists. The H\u00f4tel Dieu is a most valuable hospital. The nuns here not only act as nurses to the sick who are admitted into the establishment, but also as teachers of young females.\n\nUrsuline Convent, is an appropriate structure, 114 by 40 feet, and two stories high, with extensive ornamented grounds, inclosed within a stone wall: the chapel, which is adorned by several valuable pictures, is 95 by 45 feet, of plain exterior, but some of its interior decorations are splendid. The remains of Montcalm, who was killed at the attack of Quebec, in 1759, by General Wolfe, were interred near the chapel.\n\nQuebec Seminary, on Market square, is a three story building, 210 feet in length and 42 feet in depth, with rear projections 168 feet long. The hall, or chapel, is decorated by Ionic columns. The bishop of the diocese and his assistants reside here. The library consists of nearly 10,000 volumes, and the cabinet embraces a fine series of mineralogical specimens, fossils, &c., to which a choice collection of paintings has been added.\n\nCastle of St Louis, the government palace of former times: of this once immense structure, nothing is now to be seen but its blackened and naked walls. It was destroyed by fire in 1834.\n\nGovernment offices, occupy an extensive building on Front street, in which also is the museum of the Canadian Society of Arts.\nMonument to Wolfe and Montcalm, on Des Carri\u00e8res street. Jesuit's Barracks, a quadrangular building of stone, formerly occupied by the Jesuits as a college, is situated on the Market place, opposite the French cathedral.\n\nParliament House, is a fine three story structure of wrought stone, consisting of a main building, with two wings. Its massive front is embellished by four Ionic columns, with a pediment. The Colonial Assembly met here until 1841, when the constitution of the province was abrogated.\n\nCourt House, a plain building of graystone, 136 by 46 feet, is situated at the corner of St. Louis street and the Place d'Armes. The building, which is surrounded by an iron railing, is occupied by the various courts, officers of the police, sheriff, &c.\n\nMasonic Hall, opposite the post-office.\n\nMarine Hospital, a beautiful Ionic structure, four stories high and 206 feet long, is situated on the bank of Charles river. Its grounds are extensive and beautifully ornamented.\n\nAmong the places of worship, the following deserve notice: the French Roman Catholic Cathedral, east of the Market place, a neat building 216 by 108 feet, with a spire; Catholic Church of the Congregation, near the western termination of the esplanade; Notre Dame des Victoires, erected in 1690, on the Market place; English Cathedral, 134 by 73 feet, with a chime of 8 bells; Holy Trinity, in Stanislaus street; St. Matthews, a free church; St Paul's; St. Patrick's, St. Helen street; Scotch Church, in St. Anne street; St. John's, in St. Francis street; Methodist Church, St. Anne street, and another in Champlain street.\n\nThe Citadel, over Cape Diamond, includes an area of about 40 acres; and is formidable alike from its position and the extent of its works, constructed on a gigantic scale, and on the most approved principles. The Citadel contains the armory, magazine, storehouse\nand barracks for the officers. The line of the fortifications, which stretches nearly across the peninsula on the west, and runs along a ridge between the Upper and Lower towns, is intersected by five gates, and has an inner circuit of about two and a half miles. On the west, beyond the ramparts, which are 25 or 30 feet in height, are the extensive suburbs of St. Roche, St. Louis and St. John. Military parades take place daily on the great plain within the ramparts.\n\nDalhousie Gate, is the principal entrance to the citadel, which is 200 feet above the site of the Upper town, and is approached by a winding road up the glacis from St. Louis gate, which is defended by outworks of great strength. The main guard-rooms are immediately within the Dalhousie gate. From the bastion, which affords a splendid view of the city and its environs, cannon point in every direction.\n\nPalace Gate, which is near the barracks, with a guard-house adjoining, is a fine specimen of architecture.\n\nHope Gate conducts to the ascent of Cape Diamond on the east, on which point is the great battery of 32 pounders, which commands the basin and harbor. This point is upwards of 300 feet above the St. Lawrence.\n\nPrescott Gate, on Mountain street, is the barrier between the Upper and Lower towns. It is connected with the castle of St. Louis.\n\nSt. Louis' Gate opens the way to the Plains of Abraham, which are reached by a beautiful avenue, well lined with fine buildings.\n\nSt. John's Gate leads to the suburb of St. John.\n\nPublic Promenade, on the summit of the ramparts of Cape Diamond, is a wide covered way, which affords a magnificent view in all directions.\n\nGovernor's Gardens, south-west of the ruins of St. Louis, occupy a field 540 by 210 feet, which is defended by a small battery.\nAmong the establishments for educational purposes, the first place is due to the French college. It has a principal, and professors of theology, rhetoric, and mathematics, with 5 regents for the Latin and Greek classes. Here is, also, a royal grammar school, a classical academy, a national school, and many French and English private schools. A royal institution for the advancement of learning within the province, and a literary and historical society, respectively enjoy the patronage of the government and of the principal inhabitants. A mechanics' institute was established in 1830; and it has numerous benevolent associations. The city public library, though not very extensive, is said to be well selected, and to contain a great variety of standard works. The garrison, also, has a good library. Several newspapers are published in the city.\n\nThough not a manufacturing town, Quebec has various distilleries, breweries, with tobacco, soap, and candle works; and numbers of fine ships have been launched from its yards. It has two or three banks and a savings bank. The markets are well stocked with most sorts of produce, except good fish, which is rather scarce and dear.\n\nThe climate, though on the whole good and healthy, is in extremes. In summer the heat is equal to that of Naples, while the cold of winter is not inferior to that of Moscow. This inequality occasions a corresponding difference in the modes of life during the different seasons of the year. In winter travelling is carried on by means of sledges and carrioles, in the same way as in Russia. The first view of Quebec, in sailing up the St. Lawrence, is striking in the extreme; and travellers speak in high terms of the magnificent prospect from the citadel on Cape Diamond.\n\nThe majority of the population being of French extraction, the French language, which is still spoken in some of the best circles with great propriety, and the Roman Catholic religion, predominate. Society\nis here more polished and refined than in any other town of British America; and the higher provincial gentry of French descent are distinguished by the courteousness and urbanity of their manner.\n\nVessels of the very largest burden arrive at Quebec. Its harbor or basin, between the city and the island of New Orleans, is of great extent, having, in general, about 28 fathoms water, the tide rising from 16 to 18 feet at neaps, and from 25 to 30 feet at springs. Ships lie alongside the wharfs along the St. Lawrence. There are extensive flats between the lower town and the St. Charles, where, if it were deemed of importance, wet docks might be easily constructed.\n\nThe trade of the city is very extensive. It engrosses almost the entire trade of the province with the mother country, West Indies, &c.; and is annually resorted to by vast numbers of immigrants, who partly settle in Canada, but who mostly re-emigrate to the United States. It has a regular intercourse, by means of steamers, with Montreal, and other ports higher up the St. Lawrence, and with Halifax, and other ports on the Atlantic.\n\nQuebec was taken from the French in 1759. A British army, under General Wolfe, having effected a landing near the city, attacked and defeated the French army, under Montcalm, on the heights of Abraham, to the W. of the town. Wolfe fell in the moment of victory; and Montcalm, who was also mortally wounded in the action, expired soon after.\n\nThe French, panic-struck by the loss of the battle and the death of their commander-in-chief, surrendered the city before even a single battery had been opened against it. A monument was erected, under the patronage of Lord Dalhousie, in the gardens of the chateau, inscribed to the \"Immortal memory of Wolfe and Montcalm.\"\nENVIRONS OF QUEBEC.\n\nFalls of Montmorencie, a beautiful cataract of Montmorencie river, which falls into the St. Lawrence, 9 miles below Quebec. The perpendicular pitch is 216 feet; and being in full view from the St. Lawrence, affords one of the most magnificent scenes in Canada.\n\nIsland of Orleans, an island of the St. Lawrence, commences near the outlet of Montmorencie, and extends about 20 miles in a N. E. direction. It is well cultivated, and produces immense quantities of garden vegetables for the supply of the Quebec markets. The principal villages on the island are, St. Pierre, St. Laurent, St. Jean, St. Famille, and St. Francois.\n\nBeaufort, a neat village, which commences about 5 miles N. E. from Quebec, and extends, in one continued street, to the Falls of Montmorencie.\n\nCharlesbourg, six miles N. W., and New Lorette and Sonbrouze, about 10 miles west from Quebec, are neat villages, each having a church. Old Lorette and St. Foi, the former 8 and the latter 6 miles S. W. from the city, are also pretty little towns.\n\nChaudiere Falls, about 10 miles from Quebec, are in the Chaudiere river, which enters the south side of the St. Lawrence, 6 miles above the city.\n\nThe falls, which descend 130 feet, are four miles from the mouth of the river.\n\nIn descending the St. Lawrence from Quebec, the first object which attracts attention is Point Levy, surmounted by the little village of St. Joseph. Ten miles below are, St. Laurent, on the north, and Beaumont, on the south bank. These are succeeded by St. Michel, St. Vallier, and Berthier, (25 miles from Quebec,) all on the south side of the river; which, at the latter place, is nearly 10 miles in width.\n\nCape Tourment, 10 miles below the island of Orleans, is an elevated bluff, 1,800 feet in height.\nRoute from Montreal to Kingston, and thence to Niagara, by steamboat, &c.\n\nLa Chine, ........................................... 8\nCascades, ...........................................16 24\nCedres, .............................................. 7 31\nCoteau du Lac, ..................................... 7 38\nLake St. Francis, .................................... 4 42\nSt. Regis, ...........................................22 61\nCornwall, ........................................... 6 70\nLong Saute Island, ..................................10 80\nChrysler's Field, .....................................17 97\nHamilton, ............................................ 1 98\nPrescott, .............................................18 116\nBrockville, ..........................................14 139\nKingston, ...........................................43 178\nOswego, ..............................................53 236\nCoburg, ..............................................74 310\nPort Hope, ..........................................33 346\nToronto, .............................................66 412\nNiagara Village, ....................................33 442\nQueenston, .......................................... 7 419\nFalls of Niagara, .................................... 6 455\n\nLa Chine, a town of Montreal island, and one of the principal seats of the fur trade, situated near the S. E. point of the island, at the commencement of the canal around the La Chine rapids.\n\nCascades, a part of the St. Lawrence, which being greatly reduced in breadth by the intervention of an island and a point that bear this name, presents a most tumultuous appearance. The dangers of this pass are avoided by a small canal which has been cut across the point leading into lake St. Louis.\n\nCedres, a small village of Vaudreuil, on the St. Lawrence, opposite the rapids of \"Les Cedres.\"\n\nCoteau du Lac, rapids of the St. Lawrence, which are overcome by a series of locks. The village of Coteau du Lac is on the north bank of the river, near the rapids.\nLake St. Francis, an expansion of the St. Lawrence, about 30 miles in length, with a mean width of 4 miles. At the head of the lake is St. Regis, an Indian village, situated on the St. Lawrence, just above the boundary line between New York and Canada.\n\nCornwall, a village of Stermont, Canada West, situated on the north bank of the St. Lawrence.\n\nLong Saut Island, in the St. Lawrence.\n\nChrysler's Field.\u2014Here the Americans were defeated by a British force, under Col. Pearson, Nov. 11, 1813.\n\nHamilton, a village of St. Lawrence county, New York.\n\nPrescott, a village of Greenville, Canada West, situated nearly opposite Ogdensburg.\n\nBrockville, a flourishing town and seat of justice for Leeds county, Canada West.\n\nKingston, a large and important town of western Canada, which occupies the site of old fort Frontenac, at the outlet of lake Ontario, opposite Grand island. It was laid out in 1784, and is now the most populous in the province, having about 3,000 inhabitants. Its situation, as an entrep\u00f4t between Canada and the United States, is very advantageous. The harbor is excellent, and admits vessels of the largest size. Its public buildings are, 4 churches, a court house, jail, hospital, and some others. The Rideau canal, the most extensive and costly work in British America, commences here, and extends in a general N. E. direction to Bytown, on the Ottawa, a distance of 129\u00bd miles.\n\nOswego, an incorporated village and seat of justice of Oswego county, situated on lake Ontario, at the mouth of Oswego river. Besides the court house and other county buildings, there are, 7 churches, a custom house, 2 banks, an academy, and about 600 other buildings, including 2 cotton factories, 7 flouring mills, tan yard, morocco factory, 2 iron foundries, 6 machine shops, a snuff factory, plaster, planing, and\nsaw mills, 2 ship yards, &c. The town and harbor are defended by fort Ontario, situated on the right bank of the river, at its confluence with lake Ontario. The site of old fort Oswego, which was on the opposite side of the river, is now occupied by a ship yard, a marine railway, and warehouses. The Oswego canal extends hence to Syracuse, a distance of 38 miles, where it intersects the Erie canal.\n\nOswego, which has a population of not less than 5,000, is the most populous and commercial town on the shore of lake Ontario, and its manufactures are vast and various. The Oswego river affords an almost unlimited water power, which is employed by many of the factories and workshops; and its means of inter-communication are not less important.\n\nCoburg and Port Hope are two small villages of Newcastle district, Canada West.\n\nToronto, formerly the seat of government for Upper Canada, is beautifully situated within an excellent harbor, formed by a peninsula, which confines a basin of water sufficiently capacious to contain a large fleet. It was originally called York, which name was changed to that of Toronto a short time prior to the late disturbances in Canada, which at once deprived the place of its consequence as the seat of government, and also led to the abolition of the constitutional system, which, until then, had been in operation.\n\nNiagara Village, a small settlement and fort on the west bank of Niagara river, at its entrance into lake Ontario.\n\nQueenston, a small village of Niagara district, Canada West, situated on Niagara river, nearly opposite to Lewistown.\n\nThe battle of Queenston, in which the British General, Brock, was killed, October 13, 1812, was fought on the heights near the village, upon which a monument to the memory of Brock has been erected.\n\nNiagara Falls.\n| A                  | PAGE |\n|--------------------|------|\n| Acquackanonk       | 42   |\n| Albany             | 57   |\n| Albion, routes from| 59   |\n| Albion             | 77   |\n| Alden              | 68   |\n| Alexandria         | 83   |\n| Amsterdam          | 60   |\n| Angelica           | 106  |\n| Antwerp            | 102  |\n| Argyle             | 88   |\n| Astoria            | 24   |\n| Athens             | 55   |\n| Attica             | 68   |\n| Avon springs       | 107  |\n| Auburn             | 63   |\n\n| B                  |      |\n|--------------------|------|\n| Baie               | 148  |\n| Baker's falls      | 85   |\n| Ballston lake      | 80   |\n| Ballston Spa       | 79   |\n| Barnegat           | 52   |\n| Batavia            | 67   |\n| Bath               | 108  |\n| Batiscorn          | 149  |\n| Beaufort           | 156  |\n| Beaumont           | 156  |\n| Bedford            | 25   |\n| Bedlow's island    | 29   |\n| Bemu's heights     | 89   |\n| Bergen             | 67   |\n| Bergen, N.
