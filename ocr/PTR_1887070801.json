For primary education, the Government has done sufficient encouragement and the judicious management of our school trustees in procuring teaching power of high standard, and their arrangements for providing early supplies of ample school accommodation are nothing to be desired. In the rector of the present High School, too, we have a gentlemen who not only encourage a certain amount of improvement on the part of the school, but to this extent urge upon the present officers to make every effort in the direction of making the institution what it might become\u2014a model of its kind.\n\nWe feel sure that our children will benefit by such excellent arrangements, and that they would consider themselves well provided for in having such a first-class school at their command. We may therefore highly recommend this institution to those who may be desirous of sending their children there to be educated in the best manner possible.\n\nSUNDAY CHURCH SERVICES\nSt. Alban\u2019s and St. Mary\u2019s Churches\u201410 a.m.\u2014Services are held both churches and services are conducted by Revs. A.

It may be safely said that no single event in history has ever occasioned so spontaneous, so genuine, so widespread expression of recognition and anticipation of the earth as Queen Victoria\u2019s Jubilee. It has been like that \u201ctouch of nature which makes the whole world kin.\u201d\n\nAmong the occurrences that are reaching of their most memorable celebrations, interest naturally centers in the gorgeous pageant at Westminster Abbey. Future it was that this brilliant spectacle which, in living contrast throws all previous triumphs of journalism in shadow should have been enacted in that historic scene which for eight hundred years has been the scene of so many striking incidents in the nation\u2019s annals\u2014at once the crowning place and the resting place of kings, the Valhalla of British heroes\u2014the resting place of poets, of scholars, and of statesmen.\n\nBut perhaps the most impressive feature in the spectacle to a great degree, whatever people in the contemplation of these vast multitudes of royal subjects of different religious faiths and political creeds\u2014but of one heart and one mind in their love of Queen and country, no denizens claim; the tents and war- implements of every \u201ccoign of vantage\u201d from palace gate to abbey tower. And as the deafening roar from myriads of loyal throats swelled and died down along the route, it must have been strongly borne in upon thoughtful minds how deeply seated and genuine is British loyalty, and how far removed above the strife of parties.\n\n* * *\nT is a rich, rough gem,\nBorn to who cana\nThe heart of a free-born Englishman.\nThe Times is the best medium in the Territory to advertise your business in.\n\nSubscribe for The Times and get the latest news and happenings around town.\n\nJOB PRINTING\n\nOf all descriptions done neatly, quickly and cheaply\n\nJ.

The weather was sunny and fine, and there were bands and rain, which, though of vast importance to our agricultural friends, was not enough to prevent people from gathering in large numbers. Fortunately, however, the morning breaks appeared, and the parade was well attended and celebrated by the royal bands as they marched through town.\n\nAt seven o\u2019clock in the morning the P. A. Band went out and commenced the day\u2019s rejoicings by playing the Royal Air Band, followed by a band of music in excellent style.\n\nThe next part of the programme made up by the Police Band, and the N.W. Police played on the bandstand in front of the former, and which turned out so beautifully. The police bands have been recently organized, but the struggles were insufficient in having come so near the conclusion.\n\nWith a little more practice, we shall have no doubt of the end result, which will make an interesting treat for those who come to see them show good work. Perhaps the best part of the programme was the salutes fired by the crowd of salutes, which was arranged by Judge McCann, President. The next part of the programme was the chairman, Judge Isaac Smith, and the chief Justice, Mr. Isaac Smith. He then proceeded to explain the programme, which was most excellent. He spoke at length about the importance of the day and the significance of the event itself.\n\nMr. Isaac Smith\u63a5\u7740\u4e0a\u573a\uff0c\u9886\u5bfc\u4e86\u6574\u4e2a\u8282\u76ee\u3002\u4ed6\u70ed\u60c5\u6d0b\u6ea2\u5730\u53d1\u8868\u4e86\u8bb2\u8bdd\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u6d3b\u52a8\u7684\u56fd\u5bb6\u6218\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7279\u5b9a\u65e5\u5b50\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u6b21\u6f14\u8bb2\u6df1\u53d7\u542c\u4f17\u7684\u559c\u7231\u3002\n\n\u63a5\u7740\u662f\u8868\u60c5\u751f\u52a8\u7684\u97f3\u4e50\u8868\u6f14\uff0c\u7531\u7687\u5bb6\u7a7a\u4e2d\u4e50\u961f\u548c\u8b66\u5bdf\u4e50\u961f\u6f14\u594f\u3002\u8868\u6f14\u8005\u4eec\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e86\u65e0\u4e0e\u4f26\u6bd4\u7684\u70ed\u60c5\uff0c\u89c2\u4f17\u88ab\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u7cbe\u5f69\u6f14\u51fa\u6240\u611f\u67d3\u3002\n\n\u5728\u4e00\u5929\u7ed3\u675f\u4e4b\u9645\uff0c\u7687\u5bb6\u7a7a\u4e2d\u4e50\u961f\u518d\u6b21\u767b\u53f0\uff0c\u6f14\u594f\u4e86\u53d7\u6b22\u8fce\u7684\u4e50\u66f2\u3002\u5f53\u5929\u7684\u8282\u76ee\u5982\u6b64\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u4ee5\u81f3\u4e8e\u5f15\u8d77\u4e86\u8d5e\u8d4f\u548c\u70ed\u70c8\u8ba8\u8bba\u3002", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-06", "created": "2025-10-06", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdfs_sask_test/PTR_1887070801.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 4, "total-input-tokens": 6134, "total-output-tokens": 1906, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 0, 1], [0, 3719, 2], [3719, 4361, 3], [4361, 6974, 4]], "primary_language": ["en", "en", "en", "en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true, true, true, true], "rotation_correction": [0, 0, 0, 0], "is_table": [false, false, false, false], "is_diagram": [false, false, false, false]}}]
