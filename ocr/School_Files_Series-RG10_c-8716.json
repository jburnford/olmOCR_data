Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for by the instructions.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, pasting it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days that each pupil was actually enrolled on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per pupil grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount per pupil grant. If no pupil is in school, no grant will be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils in school.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. (On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.)\n\nINFORMATION CONCERNING THE INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sacred Heart Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1946.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: December 31, 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: [Signature]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days the residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per pupil grant due the quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the rate of the quarterly per pupil grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On the Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sacred Heart Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1947.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: March 31, 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDated at this date, 1947.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 405\nReps.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper place on the second sheet.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly grant allowed. In no case, however, will payment be made on any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sacred Heart Residential School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1947.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated June 30, 1947.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent:\n\nDated at this date.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days present in school of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, any adjustment made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE:\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sacred Heart Ind. Res. School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1947.\n\nPrincipal: Maurice Lefebvre\n\nDated: Oct 4th, 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated: OCT 8, 1947\n\nNOTE:\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return, and is ascertained by adding the column under \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a

PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. Where, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, pegged to No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is determined by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sacred Heart School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1949.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: March 31, 1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated:\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**Brocket Agency**\n\n**REPORT of the Sacred Heart School at Brocket on Pelican Reserve for Quarter ended March 31, 1946.**\n\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAME OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY/GIRL | CLASS OF STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|-----------------|---------------|-----|----------|----------------|-------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|\n| 0153            | Anna Bella Yellow F. 10 | 10 | \"Pelican H-162\" | \"7\" | \"10 10 9 9 4 4 1\" | | May 29/46 | 91 - 57 |\n| 0154            | Genevieve Urier | 11 | \"E-116\" | | | | Oct. 2/46 | 91 - 57 |\n| 0156            | Frances Smith | 9 | \"E-99\" | | | | Dec. 11/46 | 91 - 57 |\n| 0156            | Letta Little Mustache | 10 | \"B-60\" | | | | Jan. 8/46 | 91 - 57 |\n| 0157            | Gladys Provost | 9 | \"A-156\" | | | | do | 91 - 57 |\n| 0158            | Mary J.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending March 31st, June 30th, September 30th, and December 31st respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the SACRED HEART School for the Quarter ended June 30th, 1948.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated: June 30th, 1948\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nAnthony M.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, pagin No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is determined by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per pupil grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the SACRED HEART School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1948.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: October 10, 1948\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nAnthony M.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is determined by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payments be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a

$\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return use another sheet, page 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The quarters must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days attended by all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, should any grant be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sacred Heart School for the Quarter ended June 30th, 1945.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: July 1st, 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated:\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days present of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, shall any grant be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sacred Heart School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1949.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: October 5, 1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDated: [Signature]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereon.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days pupils have been full pupils on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI declare Country that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1964.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated: March 31, 1964\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nAnthony M.

RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. Where, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, ruling it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be promptly returned to the Department.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter (including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays).\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days present of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days' residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\nThe amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, shall grants be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sacred Heart Indian School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30, 1950.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated October 2nd, 1950\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this date, 1950\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Discharged\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 30th March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days' attendance of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On the Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sacred Heart Ind. Residential school for the Quarter ended December 31st, 1950.\n\nDated January 10, 1951\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days attended by all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nIndian Residential School Quarterly Return\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sacred Heart Residential School for the Quarter ended March 31st, 1951.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated April 1st, 1951\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nthis\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 463\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**REPORT OF THE Sault Ste.

THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN.\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, shall payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a

RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is determined by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sacred Heart Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30th, 1951.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated October 1st, 1951\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this date, 1951\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReg.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days present in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is determined by adding the columns under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, shall the amount payable for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sacred Heart Residential School for the Quarter ended December 31st, 1951.\n\nPrincipals\n\nDated January 1st, 1952\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. IA. 403\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**REPORT of the Sacred Heart R.C.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. Where, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the grant per capita allowed. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

column.\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. Where, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the form, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly period ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount allowed per pupil. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" (q.v.).\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sacred Heart School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1952.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated: ___________________________ 19____\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: ___________________________ 19____\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. LA. 403\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS          | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|----------------|--------------------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|--------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|\n| 0177           | Margo Grier             | 11  |     |      | E-115          |                    |                         | Sept.6-49                   | 91         |\n| 0179           | Elsie Aline Pastien     | 8   |     |      | E-79           |                    |                         | do                          | 91         |\n| 0180           | Katherine \"mall Legs\"   | 9   |     |      |                |                    |                         | Apr.6-50                    | 91         |\n| 0181           | Nancy Smith             | 7   |     |      | R-99           |                    |                         | June 20-50                  | 91         |\n| 0182           | Josephine Plain \"egle\"  | 10  |     |      | R-96           |                    |                         | Sept.5-50                   | 91         |\n| 0183           | Bernadette Wolf Tail    | 11  |     |      | A-127          |                    |                         | do                          | 91         |\n| 0184           | Margaret \"sett\"         | 9   |     |      | B-50           |                    |                         | do                          | 91         |\n| 0185           | Rose Mary Smith         | 8   |     |      | B-73           |                    |                         | do                          | 91         |\n| 0186           | Lorrain Provost         | 9   |     |      | A-106          |                    |                         | do                          | 91         |\n| 0187           | Fansy English           | 9   |     |      |                |                    |                         | do                          | 91         |\n| 0188           | Martha Fard             | 9   |     |      | W-95           |                    |                         | do                          | 91         |\n| 0189           | \"rnestine Urier         | 8   |     |      |                |                    |                         | do                          | 91         |\n| 0190           | Bernadette \"row Flag\"   | 8   |     |      |                |                    |                         | Nov.11-50                   | 91         |\n| 0191           | \"ecilla-A.Big Weasel\"   | 9   |     |      |                |                    |                         | Sept.4-51                   | 91         |\n| 0192           | Angelina Fard           | 9   |     |      | E-101          |                    |                         | do                          | 91         |\n| 0193           | Eileen Black Water      | 8   |     |      |                |                    |                         | Apr.15-52                   | 91         |\n\n**TOTALS**\n\n|                | 30 | 42 | 17 | 20 | 7 | 7 | 2 | 11 | 3 | 7 |\n\n**NOTE**\u2014Additions to be correctly made and entered at the foot of column.\n\n**TOTAL number of days in Quarter:** 652\n\n**Average attendance of pupils during Quarter:** 71.69\n\n**Average per capita grant disbursed for Quarter:** 530\n\n(a) If this is a church-owned residential school state the number of:\n(i) non-Indian children who are boarders: 0\n(ii) non-Indian children who are day school pupils: 0\n\n\\[ \\text{Total} = 71.69 \\times 362.25 = 64924.3 \\]\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**REPORT of the Sacred Heart Ind.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 29th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is determined by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount of quarterly grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended June 30th, 1952.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated July 1st, 1952\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDated at JUL 5 1952\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the columns under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, should any deduction be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 30th March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days attended by all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the number of days in quarter.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the rate of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will the amount be less than the average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sacred Heart School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30, 1952.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated:\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated:\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**REPORT of the Sacred Heart R.C.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 3, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of pupils recorded on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE:\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sacred Heart School for the Quarter ended...

M. Graham,\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nIn regard to the well at the Roman Catholic School on the Regina Reserve, we sent men down to pull this pump and lower the cylinder as per your instructions of December 20th, but on lifting the pump we discovered that the information I had got from Mr. Pearson while I was down there in December regarding the depth of the cylinder in the well was incorrect, and we found that the cylinder was 276 ft. down with 14 ft. of pipe below the cylinder, thus bringing the pipe within 6 ft. of the bottom of the well. Therefore, we were unable to do anything that would improve the capacity of the well, as the time the writer was down there last winter, Mr. Pearson, the plumber at Pincher Creek was quite sure that the cylinder was down only only 250 ft. I have therefore prepared an alternative scheme for getting a supply of water from the spring to the East of the School, and am enclosing the print of a plan that I have prepared, which would give an adequate supply of water.\n\nYou will note that if this work were carried out, it would leave the Reservoir 10 x 30 ft. with 3 ft. of water, which would be approximately 5,000 gallons of water. As I examined this spring last winter in December, after the dry season, it was then flowing at a rate which would easily supply 6,000 to 7,000 gallons of water per day. Therefore, I have no doubt that plenty of water from this source can be got, and it would also mean that there would be at all times a supply of water for fire protection in the Reservoir at the spring as well as the capacity of the tanks at the School. In the plan you will note that I have figured a small electric-driven pump; this to be placed in a small well-built pump house, on a ledge of rock 3 ft. above the level of the water at the spring; this pump house to be built very warm, so that only a very small amount of heat would be necessary in the coldest weather to keep the pump from freezing. In fact, I believe that by packing this with planer shavings and making two air spaces, it would be unnecessary to have any heat at all. This could be connected with the switch board in such a way that -\na way that it would be impossible to start the motor on the batteries and only could be used while the plant was running. As it could be controlled from the School, it would be no more trouble to start the pump than at present; in fact, not as much. I would recommend that a Westco Turbine pump be used direct-connected to a 2 H.P. motor. This pump would work up to 200 ft. head, or about 10 lbs. pressure, if necessary. This is more pressure than is needed in the pressure tank, but I consider this in case of fire, it would be an advantage to be able to raise the pressure on the line. The capacity of this pump would be about 15 gallons per minute, or 400 per hour; therefore, running the pump an hour in the morning and evening should give the School an ample supply of water.\n\nI found the supply of water in the old well at the present time just a little less than it was when I made the test last winter. I have prepared an estimate of the cost of installing, and figure that it can be done for Three Thousand ($3,000.00) dollars. This would include excavating, and the building of the concrete reservoir; roofing the same with wooden roof and rubberoid roofing; laying 1\u00bd inch galvanized pipe to the School and connecting to the pressure tank; building a 7 x 7 pump house and again the same as near frost-proof as possible; supplying the necessary pump as stated before, and building the pole-line from the present pole-line to the barn down to the Spring, and making the necessary electrical connections to the engine room.\n\nTrusting that this may be of some use to you, I am,\n\nYours truly,\n\nBrotherston Electric Co. Ltd.\nSgd. R. A. Brotherston,\nManager.\nSir:\n\nI beg to bring to your attention the matter of the water supply at the R.J. School on the Regina Reserve. You will recall that for the last year several reports have been made regarding the shortage of water at this school. Mr. Brotherston, of the Brotherston Electric Company Limited at Calgary, was asked to make a report on this during the winter, which he did, but on account of the severity of the weather he could not accomplish much and I have only just now received a final report from him, a copy of which is attached. You will note from this that he makes a recommendation to build a reservoir at the spring which is situated a short distance from the school, and which he states by actual test would supply from 6,000 to 7,000 gallons of water per day. He has clearly set out what he proposes to do and has forwarded a drawing which I am enclosing. You will note that the cost would be $2,000.00. I see no other way out of this difficulty than to recommend using the surface water mentioned, as the present well is 300 feet deep, and we might spend possibly $1,500.00 in drilling another well and then not get water, whereas the supply from the spring should at all times be sufficient to keep this institution well supplied with water.\n\nI would be glad to have your instructions in the matter at your earliest convenience. If the Department desires to go ahead with it, I should be glad if the blue print is returned.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\nJuly 14, 1930.\n\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 2nd with reference to the water supply system at the R.C. School on the Peigan Reserve, I beg to say that there are no funds available for this work, but a note is being made for next year's estimates.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nW. H.

This matter has been given careful consideration and I regret the improvement you recommend cannot be proceeded with this year, as there are no funds for the purpose. The Appropriation for Indian Education is completely assigned.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nJuly 24, 1930.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDR. SCOTT.\n\nThree weeks ago, Mr. Commissioner Graham reported that he had arranged for the Bretherston Electric Company, of Calgary, to look into the question of the water supply at the Sacred Heart Indian Residential School, on the Peigan Reserve. Earlier, it had been reported that there was a shortage. The recommendation is that a spring, 1000 ft. away, be used. The cost of the reservoir, the water line, the pump house with electric pump and necessary electrical and water connections, would be $3,000.\n\nMr. Graham was informed that there were no funds available but that a note would be made for next year's Estimates. He now replies that the matter is serious and he believes that it should receive the earliest consideration of the Department. Of course, there are no funds provided for the purpose. Mr. Orr suggests that the Dominion Water Power Branch be asked to look into the matter when the expenditure can be authorized.\n\nRussell Steiner\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of the Department's letter of the 14th inst. (No file No) in connection with the water supply system at the R.C. School on the Pegem Reserve and I note that there are no funds available for this work but that note is being made for next year's estimates.\n\nSurely the Department have not given this matter serious attention. If I had any idea that the school could get along with the present supply of water, I certainly would not have recommended that $500.00 be spent to bring in an additional supply, but after having the matter thoroughly investigated by a competent firm, the only solution out of the difficulty, was the spring referred to in my letter of the second inst. I might inform you, since reading the above mentioned letter, I have had a letter from Mr. Lancaster, the Agent, reporting the extreme shortage of water and requesting that some action be taken as soon as possible. I have also had a letter from the Principal which reads in part, as follows: \"I beg to tell you that our water supply is getting worse all the time and therefore I will respectfully ask you to see that something is done as soon as possible to improve it.\"\n\nFrom information I have now, the water supply in the well, is gradually diminishing and\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nthe school can get along at the present time, while the holidays are on, you will realize that they cannot very well go into the winter without an adequate supply of water.\n\nYou have all the information that I have in this connection, I just simply wish to point out that the matter is serious and requires the earliest consideration of the Department,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nSacred Heart Indian School, Brocket, Alta. August 22, 1930.\n\nH. C. Lancaster,\nIndian Agent, Brocket.\n\nDear Sir;-\n\nI was very sorry to hear the other day that we are condemned to wait till next summer before getting a better supply of water and exposed to be without any water at all, unless a long and heavy rain comes to save us: anyhow, I hope the Department will not leave us without light. Our storage batteries have lasted already longer than they were supposed, according to what we were told by the Contractor in 1927; but now, they are really exhausted, and therefore I will be very much obliged if you will kindly ask the Department to renew them immediately.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Signed) J. L. Levern, O.M.E.,\nPrincipal.\nPeigan Indian Agency, Brocket, Alta.,\nAugust 26th, 1930.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to forward herewith copy of a letter received from the Principal of the Sacred Heart Indian Residential School, requesting The Department to furnish them with a replacement of Storage Batteries, for the lighting-plant at that school.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.

I know that you have done all you could to have it done immediately, and I thank you from my heart.\n\nAt the same time, I beg to say again that I do not want to assume the responsibility of starting the long winter with such a poor supply of water; it sounds too much like tempting the Providence of God. I hope and pray that nothing serious will happen to stop our work in the school; but I beg to repeat again that I am not without worrying about this sad condition.\n\nThanking you again, I remain, dear Sir,\n\nYours sincerely.\n\nSgd.

The Department will be glad to have your report in this connection, and a statement concerning the steps you are taking to minimize the danger of loss of life and property by fire.

October 24th, 1930.\n\nReport of Inspector Christianson on Schools in the Peigan Agency.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have the honour to submit the following report on the boarding schools in the Peigan Agency, which were visited during my recent inspection of that Agency.\n\nSACRED HEART INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL (R.C.)\n\nAt the present time, there are 50 children in residence at this school, 30 girls and 20 boys. As the school has been recently inspected by the Provincial Department School Inspector, I will not comment on the work in the classrooms.\n\nWhile I was at the school the children were all taken to the Senior Classroom, and a little concert was put on for my benefit. I was very much impressed with the appearance of the children. They were well dressed, clean and tidy, and looked healthy. Their skin was clear, and there was not a child in the school who had any signs of sores or skin disease on the neck or face. What was uppermost in my mind at the time of my visit was what a great difference, for the better, there was in the appearance of the children attending the school today between that of the children who attended the old school, which was situated across the river when I first visited the Peigan Agency about eleven years ago. The fact that they are living under better conditions in the new school and receiving better care.\n\nW.M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nbetter nourishment, as well as more attention being paid to their education now than there was years ago, is certainly apparent in their appearance.\n\nThis school is well managed in every way. The building inside, from top to bottom, is well taken care of - could not be better. The same can be said about the outside.\n\nThe farming has been exceptionally good, as you will see by the following. This fall they threshed 4,200 bus. of wheat, 1,300 bus. of oats, and 1,200 bus. of barley, as well as raising 10 tons of potatoes, cabbage, carrots, onions, turnips, and other garden truck - more than they can make use of. A lot of trees and shrubs of all descriptions are being cultivated around the school, and in a few years, in the summer, these grounds will become a real show place. The Brother who is in charge of the outside work is one of the best gardeners that I know of.\n\nThey have 56 head of cattle. Out of this there are 18 or 20 cows, and at the time of my visit, they were milking 14 cows. The school sells no milk or cream, and it is all used for the benefit of the children. I was informed that butter was placed on the table every day for the use of the children and staff. The children also get all the milk they can drink. They also had 37 pigs and a lot of chickens. The foregoing is the main reason for the fine appearance of the children. The school is producing a big revenue over and above the grant, which means\nSACRED HEART INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL (R.C.) CONT'D.\n\nmeans that they do not have to curtail their expenditures so much.\n\nIn my report dated December 5th, 1929, I stated that the cement floor in the boys' playroom was unsatisfactory and that when the boys were playing there, the room became filled with dust from the cement. The Principal and the Sisters again complained of this matter. As the room is small, I am of the opinion that if two coats of cement paint were put on, it would be of great benefit, and although the paint would eventually wear out, it would certainly keep the dust down for a considerable time.\n\nAnother matter pointed out in my report at that time was the supplying of screens for the basement windows. When the boys are playing outside around the building, the glass in the windows is continually being broken as the bottom of the sash is just even with the ground. The cost of putting a wire screen on these windows would not amount to very much, and would prevent the continual breaking of glass, which is unavoidable with a number of children playing around the school every day.\n\nOn the whole, everything at this institution is very satisfactory. (M. Christian)\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE.\n\nREGINA, SASK., October 28th, 1930.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a report on the two residential schools in the Pelican Agency, which were visited by Mr. Christianson early in the month.\n\nThe work at the Sacred Heart School seems to be carried on in a satisfactory manner. You will notice that the school threshed 4,200 bus. of wheat, 1,500 bus. of oats, and 1,200 bus. of barley, about one-sixth of the total crop grown by all the Indians on the reserve. You will also notice that they had a good garden, and have a fair amount of cattle - 56 head. It is pleasing to note that they are milking 14 cows. The Inspector does not state whether the girls are milking the cows or not. He should have stated this in his report as this is an important part of the training of the girls. Nor does he make any comment as to whether the children are baking bread.\n\nThe Inspector makes comment about supplying screens for the basement windows. It occurs to me that it should be up to the Principal to buy these screens. This will give you an idea of how much they depend upon the Department to supply every little thing, and it is getting a heavy job looking after all the small details at our residential schools. They even call upon the Department to make minor repairs. To my mind, it is absurd.\n\nVery little is said about the St. Cyprian School. As you will note, the Principal and his wife, who acts as Matron, were away at the time of the Inspector's visit. Special mention is made of the summer fellow at this school, which is well done. I believe Mr. Barlow, the Principal, will make a success of this work.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Commissioner.\nSir:\n\nOn the 3rd instant I wrote advising you that I had visited the H. C. school on the Peigan Reserve and found that the water supply situation there is really serious. I pointed out to the Department the probable result if the buildings were seriously menaced by fire, and stated that my observations were made notwithstanding that, in a previous report that the situation should be met by an expenditure of money, I was advised there were no funds available. Will you please advise me whether you received this letter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSacred Heart Indian Res. School, Brocket, Alta., October 28, 1930\n\nA.F. McKenzie,\nSecretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your kind letter of the 23rd inst., No 116-2-5, marked, and to repeat again in reply that the poor condition of our water supply is causing me a great and continual worry.\n\nWe have 5 Foamite and 5 Fire Gun Extinguishers and 4 axes, placed in the different stories of the house, and 2 fire escapes; the fire escapes are situated at each end of the building, with doors opening on them, in the upper stories. The pupils are given a fire drill at least once a month during the night, and the large pupils are taught to take care of the little ones; when the alarm is rung, each large pupil runs towards the bed of the little one intrusted to his care. Every night, after everybody is gone to bed, I go around with my flashlight and assure myself that everything is O.K.\n\nOn the other hand, I believe that it would be a good idea indeed to have a night watchman from now on till the spring; we have a man, right here, who would be glad to do this if he is given a decent salary.\n\nBy the way, let me respectfully ask the Department this question: Why do you build on the Indian Reserves such narrow and high schools? We are not in the cities, where the lots cost so much; we have as much room as can be desired, and it costs nothing.\n\nThanking you for your kind letter, I remain, dear Sir,\n\nYour faithful servant,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nNovember 5, 1930.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have your 406-11 of the 28th ultimo, enclosing Mr. Inspector Christianson's report on the residential schools in the Peigan Agency. Minor improvements, like screens on the basement windows and cement paint for the boys' playroom floor, should be attended to by the school management.\n\nMy attention has also been drawn to your letter of the 30th ultimo, with reference to the water supply at the Sacred Heart School. Your earlier letter in this connection has been received and, of course, engaged the attention of the Department. There has been some correspondence with the Reverend Principal, and, while he is very worried about the inadequate supply, he is taking every precaution against fire. I have authorized him to put on a night watchman until the spring and, next year, I am in hopes that funds will be available to remedy the water supply itself.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, November 5, 1930.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo, with reference to the water supply and the protection from fire at the Sacred Heart Indian Residential School. The Department notes that you are taking extraordinary precautions at this time, and, to assist, I am instructed to authorize the engagement of a night watchman, who should continually patrol the building. A grant of $40 per month will be allowed to the school for this service. Please make the necessary arrangements without delay. Next year, I am hopeful that funds will be provided for an adequate water supply system.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nRev. J. L.

School on the Peigan Reserve in connection with the scarcity of a water supply, and enclosed therewith a report by the Brotherston Electric Company limited setting out their opinion as to methods which might be adopted to remedy the condition. The final decision of the Department, notwithstanding my urgently advising that action be taken, was that nothing could be done this fiscal year, and in your letter to me No. 116-2-5 of the 8th November last you expressed the hope that funds would be available during 1931.\n\nOn the 14th ultimo I drew your attention to the receipt of a letter from the reverend principal of the school, pointing out the alarming shrinkage of their water supply. I have just received another letter from him on the same subject, in which he states that his hired man has been hauling water from the spring since Christmas, and that the withdrawal of three barrels of water leaves the spring almost dry and a full day elapses before it fills again. He seems to express doubt as to the efficiency of the proposal of Mr. Brotherston of the Brotherston Electric Company to provide a sufficient supply of water by the adoption of the plan he proposed. It is a matter for an expert to determine how the situation can be met, and it is of sufficient importance to address you on the subject again that you may be aware of the anxiety which is in the mind of the Reverend Principal.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

Our funds for the balance of the present fiscal year are entirely exhausted, and we will be unable to pay the salary due until after April 1st, when our new appropriation will be available. I shall be pleased if you will arrange to pay Mr. William Houle, the night watchman, the salary due him, and forward, after the end of the current month, through the office of Mr. Agent Lancaster, an account covering the payments made by you up to that time.

June 10, 1931.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe - Well at R.C.School, Peigan Reserve.\n\nSir:\n\nWhen returning from Gleichen to Calgary last Saturday, I travelled with Mr. Fennerty, of the Water & Reclamation Office, Calgary, and he mentioned that he had been sent to the above school to make a report and recommendation for augmenting the insufficient water supply now being obtained from the school well.\n\nHaving been present when this well was drilled, and having personally checked the water supply at that time, I may say there was then sufficient water for the needs of the school,- fully 500 gals per hour by actual bailing test. I am informed that the flow of water has greatly declined during the past year or two, and that there is not a serious shortage.\n\nI have discussed the situation with Mr. Fredericksen, the expert well driller who recently brought in a good well at Blue Quills School, and he suggests the possibility of the perforations in the bottom length of casing having become partly clogged, thus reducing the water intake. These perforations were made to admit the water from the water-bearing strata at the bottom of the well. As the bottom length or two of casing was reduced to one size smaller, viz 5\", the case bore 4 5/8\", he thinks it may be possible to bring up this bottom length or two, and should the trouble be from clogged perforations, it could then be remedied, and the full flow of water recovered.\n\nI respectfully submit that before any very heavy expense is incurred with respect to the water supply, it might prove advantageous to send Mr. Fredericksen there to investigate the cause of this well falling off in yield, and to see if the original supply casing can be brought back, or has the necessary tackle, which he could ship to Brocket, and go right to work on his arrival. Perhaps the best time would be when the school closes for the holidays, and if Mr. Fredericksen is then disengaged, he would undertake this work, charging only his time and expenses. I should be pleased to go with him, and render all the assistance in my power, if so instructed.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Construction.\nSacred Heart Indian School, Brocket, Alta., June 1st 1931\n\nReceived from Rev.

Levern,\nSacred Heart Indian School, Brocket.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe following is the result of the bacteriological analysis of the sample of water submitted by you in our container B59, and of the chemical analysis of the sample of water submitted in container #73 for examination.\n\n**B 59 Well**\n\nNumber of organisms per c.c. or each 15 drops: 3520\n\nPresence of organisms indicating unfavourable contamination: Negative.\n\n**#73 Spring**\n\nChemical results expressed in parts per million:\n\n- Total solids: 670\n- Ignition loss: 100\n- Hardness: Medium\n- Sulphates: 125\n- Chlorides: 2\n- Alkalinity: 440 Carbonate of soda & lime.\n- Nitrites and nitrates: ---\n- Free ammonia: 0.04\n- Albuminoid Ammonia: 0.07\n\nThe water represented by the sample submitted in container B 59 does not show any bacteriological evidence of unfavourable contamination, but there was a high bacterial count for such a small amount which might indicate an entrance of surface water either down the side of the casing or through a defect in the casing. We think you should investigate for the purpose of excluding any source of contamination.\n\nThe water from the spring seems to be too high in soda to make a good boiler water. We think it could be used, but if you wish a complete boiler analysis we would recommend that you write to the Industrial Laboratory, University of Alberta, and we will be glad to send you a container on demand.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(signed) A.C. Rankin.\n\nprev. Bact. Director.\nCOPY.\n\nUniversity of Alberta,\nEdmonton, September 22, 1927.\n\nRev. J.L. Levern\nSacred Heart School\nBrockett.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter... I have gone over the analysis of this water as per letter and our files and note that the main constituents are carbonate of soda and lime and sulphate of soda.\n\nIn the boilers a certain amount of soft sludge will be precipitated but this could easily be blown off from time to time.\n\nThe soda and sulphate of soda are not excessive providing the water does not get too concentrated in the boilers and hence the value of blowing off occasionally.\n\nI do not see that you should have any great trouble with this water and in regard to any chemical which might be added there is no compound which could be economically added to reduce the soda content. A great many boiler compounds rely on making the water alkaline with soda which you already have in the water.\n\nWater such as this may give a little trouble from corrosion of fittings and if too concentrated might form to some extent, but with careful watching I think you should be able to use this water.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(signed) J.A. Kelso\nDirector Industrial Laboratories.\nProposed Water Supply for R.C. Indian Residential School\n\nBrockett, Alta.\n\nMemo. to the Commissioner,\n\nPursuant to instructions from the Director, dated 8th inst., the writer proceeded to the Peigan Reserve on 18th and investigated the water supply for the R.C. Indian School.\n\nThis school was located for many years on the Oldman river north east of Brockett. The soil at this point being gravelly and unsuitable for cultivation, the Indian Department abandoned the site in 1926 and built a new school at a point about 6 miles south of its former location near a spring which at that time was flowing quite freely, possibly 1200 or 1500 gallons or more per day. A well was drilled under the school before construction was begun. This well is located under the pump in the engine room.\n\nThe Well\n\nThis well is 300 feet deep. On Dec. 14, 1929, Mr. Brotherson, an electrical man from Calgary, pumped water from the well from 7.00 AM to 8.30 AM. He pumped it dry, eight times in 1\u00bd hours, obtaining a total yield of 1,000 gallons. The average of each pumping (closed time) was 1 hr. 45 minutes. The highest amount obtained from one pumping was 225 gallons (first trial), the lowest was 60 gallons (sixth trial). This rate would produce 1400 gallons per day. For some time past, however, the capacity has only been between 500 and 600 gallons. A large portion of the yield apparently depends on the amount of rainfall.\n\nAt present the engineer pumps the well dry in one hour. The pump works about three hours per day. Near the end of a \"trick\" it draws one piston full to two or three strokes.\n\nThe pump is a Flint and Walling Kendallville Indiana make, the Agents being Jenkins Bros. of Montreal. It was installed by Scanlan of Medicine Hat.\n\nThe Tanks\n\nThe pressure tanks, located in the engine room, are 10' long by 4' in diameter and stand upright. They would have 70 to 75 lbs. pressure if filled to capacity. The Engineer stated and the writer verified the statement by observation, that he could not fill the tank more than one-third full with a consequent pressure of only 20 to 22 lbs. He can occasionally raise it to 30 lbs. but never more, or about two-fifths full.\nThe well water is good for human beings. A 3/4\" pipe leads from the well to the barn at a depth of about 4\u00bd feet and has not frozen as yet although the winter weather has not been very severe since its installation. The writer thinks that 6 feet would be safer.\n\nEngine and dynamo\n\nThe Dynamo is a Lister Bruston 110 volts 55 amps 550 r.p.m. and develops 6 kW. The engine is a 12 h.p. gasoline engine.\n\nThe well water corrodes the engine cooling tank. A tank was obtained 15 months ago, it is now in the repair shop while the original tank is being used temporarily although it is also badly corroded. The corrosion takes place underneath, the tank being about 7 feet long and 3 feet in diameter, standing on end.\n\nThe spring\n\nThe spring (1) is located about 900 feet east of the school and 85 feet lower in elevation than the surface of the ground at the school (100-65.5). It is understood that the location of the school was dependent on this spring. It is understood that the spring possessed a much larger flow at that time - 1926, possibly 1200 or 1500 gallons or even more. The dry weather of the last couple of years had apparently lessened the flow but it was measured at about 600 gallons per day on May 19. It has yielded about the same amount all spring and since last summer. The supply apparently depends on the amount of rainfall to some extent. After a rain the 3/4\" pipe leading from the spring northward for 100 feet or so runs full. A dam 300 feet north of the spring built of stone 10 feet high impounds the water; it is about 10 feet deep at the dam. The school caretaker is also the farmer, and he hauls water in barrels to the house for washing. He can fill 3 barrels and then has to wait until the small reservoir 20' long 3' wide and 2' deep fills up again. This reservoir was formed by the construction of a small concrete wall across the location of the spring; the natural small stratum which stands several feet above the spring forming a natural circular basin. Father Laverne, Principal of the School, cleaned out the spring and built the wall.\n\nThe dam which is built of stone and 10 feet high might be raised as high as the spring to impound more water. It would then have a capacity of about 600,000 gallons, but even now there is very little, if any, overflow with its present height. The water is now about one foot below the top of the dam. In 1929 and 1930 it overflowed a little. Very little run-off can be caught. The evaporation would be very high. Every\nwinter the spring and the portion of the small coulee adjacent to it is covered with 8' or 10' of snow which forms a bank northwards from the top of the shale stratum. If a house be built here this would have to be taken into account.\n\nAnalysis of the spring water indicates a considerable amount of soda as shown by the attached analysis. It is all right for stock while the well water is good for human consumption.\n\nRequirements of the School\n\n63 human beings at 30 gallons. 1890 gallons.\n12 horses at 12 gallons 144 \"\n75 head of cattle at 12 \" 900 \"\n50 pigs at 2 gallons. 100 \"\n100 fowls 16 \"\n\nTotal. 3050 \"\n\nThe allowance for horses and cattle is considered \"fair\". Heavily worked horses or milch cows require 20 to 25 gallons.\n\nAmount available (which can be depended upon)\n\nSpring (1) 400 gallons.\nWell 550 \"\n\nTotal. 950 \"\n\nThe shortage is therefore about 2000 gallons per day.\n\nPresent Condition\n\nThe question might be asked \"If there is a shortage to this extent how is the school carrying on?\" The writer asked this question and was told that the children who should be bathed every week cannot have this attention to that extent. They also painfully economize in every way possible. When the water is not available in sufficient quantity they simply do without. The school has been carrying on under difficulties for two or three years.\n\nProposed Methods of Supplementing Supply.\n\n(1) The water impounded by the dam at the spring might be pumped to the house. This is doubtful because of the limited supply.\n\n(2) Obtaining a supply from new springs to the South of the School.\n\nThese so-called springs lie to the southwest of the School as shown on the\naccompanying map, which also indicates the general layout of the School area. An apparently intermittent spring exists about 160 feet southwest of the school and 90 feet above its base. The lay brother of the institution who has lived in this area since 1888 led the writer to this point. A narrow coulee exists here and at its head is boggy ground covered with \"niggerheads\" or willows indicating the recent presence of water. From its mouth (at 169.8 spot shot) a line of fresh vegetation extends northwards showing that water is not far from the surface and that bore supplies in a small pocket. Another intermittent \"spring\" lies 400 feet south of this and 50 or 60 feet above it. The lay brother claimed that a stream of water comes from this point after rains, apparently from the plateau to the south.\n\nAt the point (4) a well was sunk to a depth of 20 feet by the Indian owner of the house near by. It was filled up to 10 feet but a constant water supply one foot deep lies at the bottom of the well. This well, belonging to an Indian, was not bailed for measurement, as it is 500' East of the proposed well and is not itself practicable. Another well is less than 1/4 mile west of (4). Father Laverne and the lay brother contend that water can be found at (3) by excavation or drilling. The writer thinks, perhaps wrongly, that it may be found at (2) by excavation. The supply appears to be constant at (4).\n\nIf water can be found at (2), (3) or (4) by drilling or excavation or at two or three points and collected, it could be kept under gravity to the School under 96 feet head. The School is about 35 feet high. The necessary pipe trench would be 1850 feet long and six feet deep and two feet wide, or 800 cu.yds. of excavation. Details of pipe, collection of water, etc., would have to be considered later.\n\n(3) Drilling a new well near the School.\n\nThis is liable to \"rob\" the original well, or to partially fail in time of drought; similarly to No.1 well. It might prove effective however. That is a matter for an expert well-driller to decide.\n(4) Examination of the pump for defects.\n\nDefects may possibly be found but it is not probable.\n\nAn experienced driller or \"water-man\" could be taken to the site for an inspection. After all, an engineer will transport the water to the school, but it first must be found in sufficient quantity. To do this excavation of some kind must be made.\n\nIt is suggested that this be authorized in the immediate future as the situation at the school is acute.\n\nThis report is accompanied by a topographical map of the school layout, springs, etc.\n\nTwo appendices are also attached, consisting of letters to Fathers Lawrence from Provincial analysts. These consist of reports on analyses of water obtained in 1927 from the main spring to the east of the School and from the well. The writer obtained samples from the well, the east spring, and the Indians' well to the south. These have not been analysed as yet.\n\nFour photographs are enclosed.\n\nP.A.

General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to submit you these few lines about the poor condition of the water supply at our school. You are not without knowing that this has been causing us serious trouble for the last three years; finally I was told on May 4th, 1931, No. II6-25, that the \"Department was making arrangements in the immediate future to improve our water supply.\"\n\nIn fact, the Dominion Water Power and Hydrometric Service of Calgary sent here one of their men on the 19th of May, and after having made a thorough investigation, he left on the 21st, saying that he would point out to the Department the necessity of taking an immediate action... Since that day we have been waiting and have not heard any more about it; we are still waiting, we are still suffering, our water supply has not improved, and in the meantime the sewer pipe system is giving us poor satisfaction on that account.\n\nTherefore I will ask you to be kind enough to give your personal attention to the matter, so that the work may be started as soon as possible.\n\nThanking you most sincerely for all the past favours, I remain, dear Sir,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ.

Lancaster\nIndian Agent\nJuly 30, 1931.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to refer to your letter of the 22nd of June with reference to the water supply system for the Sacred Heart Indian Residential School on the Pelican Reserve.\n\nIt is noted on page 5 of the report submitted that it may be possible to obtain a satisfactory water supply by a gravity system from new springs to the south of the school. It is thought that if a gravity system could be installed at a reasonable cost that the same would best meet the requirements of the Institution. I would, therefore, ask you to kindly instruct the Commissioner of Irrigation at Calgary to take what action he thinks necessary to determine whether it would be possible to obtain a satisfactory water supply as outlined in Paragraph 2 of his proposed method of supplementing the supply.\n\nIf a satisfactory water supply can be secured by this system, I would ask that you submit a full detailed estimate of the cost of the installation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.

FETTERLY\nAssistant Hydraulic Engineer.\nINTRODUCTORY.\n\nThe Sacred Heart School is located in the Peigan Indian Reserve, about six miles south-east of Brockett, Alberta. The school was built in 1926, and contains 63 inmates. There are also 12 horses, 75 head of cattle, 50 pigs and 100 fowl.\n\nThe original water supply, consisting of a 300 foot well under the engine room producing when drilled 1200 to 1400 gallons per day, and a spring 1000 feet east of the school producing, in the opinion of the Principal, 1200 to 1500 gallons per day, was considered sufficient to meet the school requirements. Both of these sources, however, lessened in yield during the dry weather of the last few years. The well at the present time produces only 550 gallons per day while the spring, until lately, produced only 400 gallons through a surface pipe.\n\nFaint indications of water were found lately on the side of the hill to the south of the school, 1700 feet away and 90 feet above. This was favoured for development by the Principal and his assistants. Plans were tentatively made to excavate or drill for water at this point. An exhaustive study, however, indicated that drilling, pumping and excavation would be prohibitive as to cost, particularly in view of the fact that a drill, possibly through rock, might not find water. A visible supply is always better than a speculative supply. Consequently this site was abandoned as a source.\n\nAttention was then turned to the original spring.\nThis spring is located at the head of a small coulee 100 feet wide on top and 12 feet deep, beginning abruptly at the face of a partially laminated sandstone ledge, 10 feet thick, of which 7 feet is above the surface of the ground. A small concrete wall had been constructed by the principal across the face of the coulee and three or four feet away from the ledge, which faces the north. This wall is 3 feet high, the top almost coinciding with the bottom of the coulee. It was decided to excavate between this wall and the ledge to a sufficient depth to ascertain the full capacity of the spring, which was at the time producing 400 gallons per day. The material, consisting of laminated sandstone about 3 feet thick overlying soft laminated clay shale, was excavated for the full width of 30 feet to a depth, in the centre, of 5.5 feet. Two distinct streams of water were uncovered, a large one on the west side and a smaller stream on the east side. These were carefully measured several times.\n\nThe west spring produced 830 gallons per day while the east spring produced 360 gallons. Water was also allowed to collect in a deep sump. The water collecting in this sump was measured for a period of 3 hours, and was found to produce 216 gallons or at the rate of 1728 gallons per day. The sides of the pit were seen to exude small streams, evidently not seepage water; this accounts for the difference between the yield of the two small springs and the total yield.\n\nIt is also apparent that 1300 gallons which had\nbeen flowing through the laminated material was now intercepted by the excavation. These measurements were made after a long period of dry weather and therefore evidently represent the minimum capacity. The above data could only be obtained after actual development of the spring. Development of the spring would insure a reliable water supply for the school since the total discharge of the existing well under the boiler room plus that to be anticipated from the spring when fully developed should equal 2300 gallons per day. This quantity should be ample for all moderate requirements. It was therefore considered feasible to develop the spring and to design a pumping system to carry water to the school.\n\nPlans and profiles of the proposed works, together with estimates of the cost, accompany this report. The elevations given on the plans and profiles are an assumed datum. The top of the east manhole cover of the coal bin at the school is taken as 100.00.\n\nGENERAL DESCRIPTION.\n\nThe necessary construction consists of improvement works at the spring, a pipe line about 6 to 7 feet deep from the spring to the school, and installation of a pump.\n\nIMPROVEMENT WORKS AT THE SPRING\n\nThe accompanying plan shows the extent of these works. Excavation is necessary in order to form a foundation\nfor a tank and to intercept the spring water, which is evidently flowing through the subsoil at present. A tank, 7'4\" x 7'4\" x 9'0\" high, outside dimensions is to be constructed in the centre of the spring area. A manhole 4'4\" x 4'4\" x 5'0\" high is to be constructed above the tank for inspection purposes. These concrete structures should be reinforced.\n\nTwo impervious plank wing walls will extend from the north, or outside, face of the tank to the sides of the coulee. These wing walls will be carried to the same height as the tank. Two short plank walls will be constructed against the face of the natural ledge to a height of 4 feet from the bottom of the excavation. The space on each side of the tank and between these plank walls and the face of the ledge will be filled with stones, gravel and sand, as indicated on the plans. The excavated space on the outside of the wing walls will be filled with impervious clay adjacent to the planks and earth over all.\n\nThe tank will really act as a sump, holes being left in the sides to allow free ingress of water.\n\nAn overflow pipe, placed at about the original elevation of the water, and leading to the outside of the main fill, and covered with stones and manure will provide for surplus water, which can be used for stock-watering purposes. Two pipes should lead the water from the two main springs to the central tank.\n\nThe original surface of the water was, and is, at an elevation of 86.0. The bottom of the tank will be constructed at an elevation of 79.0. The foot valve of\nthe supply pipe will be located 6\" above the inside bottom of the tank. The tank will be reinforced to withstand the pressure of the soil and stones surrounding it on all sides. The reinforcing rods should be bent at appropriate points to withstand shear.\n\nThe 2\" supply pipe will lead from this tank to the trench.\n\nTrench and Supply Pipe.\n\nThe trench will be excavated to an average depth of about 6'6\" and 1000 feet long. This trench cannot be built directly from the pumphouse to the spring owing to the contour of the surface. The galvanized pipe used should be 2\" inside diameter, and should be painted with a waterproofing paint. It is noted that certain cities are discarding iron pipe and are using lead and copper.\n\nIt may be necessary to locate a stand pipe near the hog corral.\n\nThe Pump.\n\nThe logical location for the pump is at the school where it can be conveniently operated. The only available space is to be found under the steps of the boiler room as the engine room is fully occupied by other machinery. The only possible space in the engine room existed at the point 'x' on the plan but this would cause an overloading of the main drive shaft. The elevation of the engine room floor is 95.6.\nThe elevation of the boiler room floor is 91.7, being 9.2 feet below the surface of the ground at that point. The difference in elevation between the bottom of the foot valve in the tank at the spring and the pump is 12'.4, i.e., 92.4 less 80.0. The probable minimum is 6'.4, i.e., 92.4 less 86.0.\n\nUnder these conditions a shallow well pump is quite sufficient to pump the water, as the maximum lift will be 12'.4 plus the loss in friction in 1000 feet of pipe and friction in five elbows, a total of slightly less than 16.0 feet. The pump will then be connected with the present pressure system by means of a 1/2\" pipe.\n\nThe necessary water supply should be pumped in 3 or 4 hours. The spring has an apparent capacity of about 1700 gallons per day. This work can be done with a Fairbanks-Morse Typhoon pump, Outfit No.6001-M, with a 1 h.p. motor. This pump will deliver 600 U.S. gallons per hour at a maximum pressure of 100 lbs. The School D.C. Dynamo generates 12 h.p., consequently sufficient power is available. The motor should be so arranged that starting can be done by hand while stopping will be done automatically.\n\nStorage Capacity of Tank and Rock Fill.\n\nThe total capacity of the space at the spring occupied by the tank and rock fill between the plank walls and the face of the ledge is nearly 4000 gallons, allowing 40% for voids. This represents more than two days' flow from the spring.\nESTIMATES.\n\nThe following gives the estimated cost of labour and materials necessary for the construction of the system. The prices are based on summer conditions and it is therefore imperative that the work should be finished before freeze-up to take advantage of summer prices. All prices are F.O.B.

The result of analysis is given in Appendix I. This water has four times the salinity of Calgary city water but only 75% of its hardness as most of the salinity is due to the presence of Na\u2082CO\u2083. It is therefore suitable for all purposes.\n\nPHOTOGRAPHS.\n\nPhotographs are attached to the original report.\n\nP.A.

J.L. Levern,\nSacred Heart Indian School, Brocket.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe following is the result of the bacteriological analysis of the sample of water submitted by you in our container #59, and of the chemical analysis of the sample of water submitted in container #73 for examination.\n\n**B 59 Well**\n\nNumber of organisms per c.c. or each 15 drops 3520\n\nPresence of organisms indicating unfavourable contamination -- Negative.\n\n**#73 Spring**\n\nChemical results expressed in parts per million\n\n- Total solids 670\n- Ignition loss 100\n- Hardness Medium\n- Sulphates 125\n- Chlorides 2\n- Alkalinity 440 Carbonate of soda & lime.\n- Nitrites and nitrates ---\n- Free ammonia 0.04\n- Albuminoid Ammonia 0.07\n\nThe water represented by the sample submitted in container #59 does not show any bacteriological evidence of unfavourable contamination, but there is a high bacterial count for such a deep well, which we think indicates the entrance of surface water either down the side of the casing or through a defect in the casing. We think you should investigate for the purpose of excluding any source of contamination.\n\nThe water from the spring seems to be too high in soda to make a good boiler water. We think it could be used, but if you wish a complete boiler analysis we would recommend that you write to the Industrial Laboratory, University of Alberta, and we will be glad to send you a container on demand.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(signed) A.C. Rankin.\n\nprov. Bact. Director.\nCOPY.\n\nUniversity of Alberta,\nEdmonton, September 22, 1927.\n\nRev. J.L. Levern\nSacred Heart School\nBrockett.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter... I have\ngone over the analysis of this water as per letter and our files\nand note that the main constituents are carbonate of soda and lime\nand sulphate of soda.\n\nIn the boilers a certain amount of soft sludge will\nbe precipitated but this could easily be blown off from time to time.\n\nThe soda and sulphate of soda are not excessive\nproviding the water does not get too concentrated in the boilers\nand hence the value of blowing off occasionally.\n\nI do not see that you should have any great\ntrouble with this water and in regard to any chemical which might\nbe added there is no compound which could be economically added\nto reduce the soda content. A great many boiler compounds rely on\nmaking the water alkaline with soda which you already have in the\nwater.\n\nWater such as this may give a little trouble from\ncorrosion of fittings and if too concentrated might form to some\nextent, but with careful watching I think you should be able to use\nthis water.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(signed) J.A. Kelso\nDirector Industrial Laboratories.\nProposed Water Supply for H.C. Indian Residential School\n\nBrockett, Alta.\n\nMemo. to the Commissioner.\n\nPursuant to instructions from the Director, dated 8th inst., the writer proceeded to the Peigan Reserve on 18th and investigated the water supply for the H.C. Indian School.\n\nThis school was located for many years on the Oldman river north east of Brockett. The soil at this point being gravelly and unsuitable for cultivation, the Indian Department abandoned this site in 1926 and built a new school at a point about 6 miles south of its former location near a spring which at that time was flowing quite freely, possibly 1200 or 1500 gallons or more per day. A well was drilled under the school before construction was begun. This well is located under the pump in the engine room.\n\nThe Well\n\nThis well is 300 feet deep. On Dec. 14, 1929, Mr. Brotherson, an electrical man from Calgary, pumped water from this well from 7.00 p.m. to 10.00 p.m. He found it dry eight times in nine hours, obtaining a total of 794 gallons. The average of each pumping (elapsed time) was 1 hr. 45 minutes. The highest amount obtained from one pumping was 225 gallons (first trial), the lowest was 60 gallons (sixth trial). This rate would produce 1400 gallons per day. For some time past, however, the capacity has only been between 500 and 500 gallons. A large portion of the yield apparently depends on the amount of rainfall.\n\nAt present the engineer pumps the well dry in one hour. The pump works about three hours per day. Near the end of a \"trick\" it draws one piston full to two or three strokes.\n\nThe pump is a Flint and Walling Kendallville Indiana make, the Agents being Jenkins Bros. of Montreal. It was installed by Scanlan of Medicine Hat.\n\nThe Tanks\n\nThe pressure tanks, located in the engine room, are 10' long by 4' in diameter and stand upright. They would have 70 to 75 lbs. pressure if used to capacity. The school engineer stated and the writer verified the statement by observation, that he could not fill the tanks even to one-third full with a constant pressure of only 20 to 22 lbs. He can occasionally raise it to 30 lbs. but never more, or about two-fifths full.\nThe well water is good for human beings. A 3/4\" pipe leads from the well to the barn at a depth of about 4\u00bd feet and has not frozen as yet although the winter weather has not been very severe since its installation. The writer thinks that 6 feet would be safer.\n\nEngine and dynamo\n\nThe Dynamo is a Lister Bruston 110 volts 55 amps 550 r.p.m., and develops 6 kW. The engine is a 12 h.p. gasoline engine.\n\nThe well water corrodes the engine cooling tank. A tank was obtained 15 months ago, it is now in the repair shop while the original tank is being used temporarily although it is also badly corroded. The corrosion takes place underneath, the tank being about 7 feet long and 3 feet in diameter, standing on end.\n\nThe spring.\n\nThe spring (1) is located about 900 feet east of the school and 14.5 feet lower in elevation than the surface of the ground at the school (100-85.5). It is understood that the location of the school was dependent on this spring. It is understood that the spring possessed a much larger flow at that time - 1926, possibly 1200 or even 2000 gallons or even more. The dry weather of the last couple of years has apparently lessened the flow as it was measured at about 400 gallons per day on May 10. It has yielded about the same amount all spring and since last summer. The supply apparently depends on the amount of rainfall to some extent. After a rainstorm a 3/4\" pipe leading from the spring northward for 100 feet or so runs full. A dam 300 feet north of the spring built of stone 10 feet high impounds the water. It is about 5 or 7 feet deep at the dam. The school engineer is also the farmer, and he hauls water in barrels to the house for washing. He can fill his barrel and then has to wait until the small reservoir of 30' long, 3' wide and 2' deep fills up again. This reservoir was formed by the construction of a small concrete wall across the location of the spring, the natural shale stratum which rises for 10 feet above the spring forming a natural circle behind it. Father Laverne, Principal of the School, cleaned out the spring and built the wall.\n\nThe dam which is built of stone and 10 feet high might be raised as high as the spring to impound more water. It would then have a capacity of about 600,000 gallons, but even now there is very little, if any, overflow with its present height. The water is now about one foot below the top of the dam. In 1929 and 1930 it overflowed a little. Very little run-off can be caught. The evaporation would be very high. Every\nwinter the spring and the portion of the small coulee adjacent to it is covered with 8' or 10' of snow which forms a bank northwards from the top of the shale stratum. If a house be built here this would have to be taken into account.\n\nAnalysis of the spring water indicates a considerable amount of soda as shown by the attached analysis. It is all right for stock while the well water is good for human consumption.\n\nRequirements of the School\n\n| Item                  | Gallons |\n|-----------------------|---------|\n| 63 human beings       | 1890    |\n| 12 horses             | 144     |\n| 75 head of cattle     | 900     |\n| 50 pigs               | 100     |\n| 100 fowls             | 16      |\n| **Total**             | **3050**|\n\nThe allowance for horses and cattle is considered \"fair\". Heavily worked horses or milch cows require 20 to 25 gallons.\n\nAmount available (which can be depended upon)\n\n| Source   | Gallons |\n|----------|---------|\n| Spring   | 400     |\n| Well     | 550     |\n| **Total**| **950** |\n\nThe shortage is therefore about 2000 gallons per day.\n\nPresent Condition\n\nThe question might be asked \"If there is a shortage to this extent how is the school carrying on?\" The writer asked this question and was told that the children who should be bathed every week cannot have this attention to that extent. They also painfully economize in every way possible. When the water is not available in sufficient quantity they simply do without. The school has been carrying on under difficulties for two or three years.\n\nProposed Methods of Supplementing Supply.\n\n(1) The water impounded by the dam at the spring might be pumped to the house. This is doubtful because of the limited supply.\n\n(2) Obtaining a supply from new springs to the south of the School.\n\nThese so-called springs lie to the southwest of the School as shown on the\naccompanying map, which also indicates the general layout of the School area. An apparently intermittent spring exists about 1600 feet southwest of the school and 90 feet above it. It was the lay brother of the institution who had lived in this area since 1888 led the writer to this point. A narrow coulee exists here, and at its head is boggy ground covered with \"niggerheads\" or hummocks indicating the recent presence of water. From its head (at 169.8 spot shot) a line of fresh vegetation extends northerly showing that water is not far from the surface. The boggy soil lies in a kind of pocket. Another intermittent \"spring\" lies 400 feet south of this and 50 or 60 feet above it. The lay brother claimed that a stream of water comes from this point after rains, apparently from the plateau to the south.\n\nAt the point (4) a well was sunk to a depth of 20 feet by the Indian owner of the house near by. It has filled up to 10 feet but a constant water supply one foot deep lies at the bottom of the well. This well, belonging to Indians, was not baled for measurement, as it is 600' east of the proposed well and is not itself available. Another well exists less than 1/4 mile west of (2). Whether Laverne and the lay brother contend that water can be found at (3) by excavation or drilling. The writer thinks, perhaps wrongly, that it may be found at (2) by excavation. The supply appears to be constant at (4).\n\nIf water can be found at (2), (3) or (4) by drilling or excavation or at two or three points and collected, it could be piped under gravity to the School under 90 feet head. The School is about 35 feet high. The necessary trench would be 1800 feet long and six feet deep and two feet wide, or 800 cu.yds. of excavation. Details of pipe, collection of water, etc., would have to be considered later.\n\n(3) Drilling a new well near the School.\n\nThis is liable to \"rob\" the original well, or to partially fail in time of drought, similarly to no.1 well. It might prove effective however. That is a matter for an expert well-driller to decide.\n(4) Examination of the pump for defects.\n\nDefects may possibly be found but it is not probable.\n\nAn experienced driller or \"water-man\" could be taken to the site for an inspection. After all, an engineer will transport the water to the school, but it first must be found in sufficient quantity. To do this excavation of some kind must be made.\n\nIt is suggested that this be authorized in the immediate future as the situation at the school is acute.\n\nThis report is accompanied by a topographical map of the school layout, springs, etc.\n\nTwo appendices are also attached, consisting of letters to Father Lavigne from Provincial analysts. These consist of reports on analyses of water obtained in 1927 from the main spring to the east of the School and from the well. The writer obtained samples from the well, the east spring, and the Indian's well to the south. These have not been analysed as yet.\n\nFour photographs are enclosed.\n\nP.A. Fetterly\nSir:\n\nIn further reference to your letter of May 6th regarding the Sacred Heart Indian residential school on the Peigan Reserve at Brockett, I enclose herewith a report, dated May 28th, received from the Commissioner of Irrigation, which deals with this question.\n\nThe report recommends that an expert driller should be taken to the site for an inspection so as to decide what is the most promising locality to excavate for an additional water supply.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Scott,\nDeputy Secty., Central of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to submit you these few lines about the poor condition of the water supply at our school. You are not without knowing that this has been causing us serious trouble for the last three years; finally I was told on May 4th, 1931, No. II6-2-5, that the Department was making arrangements in the immediate future to improve our water supply.\n\nIn fact, the Dominion Water Power and Hydrometric Service of Calgary sent here one of their men on the 19th of May, and after having made a thorough investigation, he left on the 21st, saying that he would point out to the Department the necessity of taking an immediate action... Since that day we have been waiting and have not heard any more about it: we are still waiting, we are still suffering, our water supply has not improved, and in the meantime the sewer pipe system is giving very poor satisfaction on that account.\n\nTherefore I will ask you to be kind enough to give your personal attention to the matter, so that the work may be started as soon as possible.\n\nThanking you most sincerely for all the past favours, I remain, dear Sir,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ. L. Levene, O.M.I.\nPrincipal\n\n[Signature]\n\nI would urge the Department to take immediate action to improve this water system.\n\nH.C. Lancaster\nIndian Agent.\nJuly 30, 1931.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to refer to your letter of the 22nd of June with reference to the water supply system for the Sacred Heart Indian Residential School on the Pelican Reserve.\n\nIt is noted on page 5 of the report submitted that it may be possible to obtain a satisfactory water supply by a gravity system from new springs to the building of the school. It is thought that if a gravity system could be installed at a reasonable cost that the same would best meet the requirements of the Institution. I would, therefore, ask you to kindly instruct the Commissioner of Irrigation at Calgary to take what action he thinks necessary to determine whether it would be possible to obtain a satisfactory water supply as outlined in Paragraph 2 of his proposed method of supplementing the supply.\n\nIf a satisfactory water supply can be secured by this system, I would ask that you submit a full detailed estimate of the cost of the installation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.

After a thorough examination it was found that the cost of drilling and excavating to prove up the springs for the gravity supply was prohibitive, and it is now recommended that the original spring now in use should be improved as further tests there have found that the supply has been enlarged so as to be sufficient for the requirements of the school. A supply of over 5,000 gallons per day is expected to be obtained from the spring as further developed, but as this is at a lower elevation than the school, pumping is required although the head to be overcome is only about 16 feet. The estimated cost of providing this additional supply is $2,040.\n\nIt should be noted that these estimates are based on summer prices, consequently in order to complete the system within the estimates, and also because the school is in great need of the water supply, the Commissioner recommends that the Department of Indian Affairs authorize this construction as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Oct. 8, 1931.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe- Water Supply at Peigan R.C. School, Brocket.\n\nSir:\n\nThis letter is unofficial, and may or may not contain any information on the above subject not already known to the Department. I have not been asked to make a report, so am merely passing on a few impressions for whatever they may be worth.\n\nHaving supervised the drilling of the well at this school, when ample water was obtained, I am naturally concerned over the falling off in the water supply during the past year or two, and have been giving a good deal of thought to the problem of providing sufficient water again for the needs of the institution and for the live stock.\n\nAfter conferring with Mr. Fetterly and Mr. French, engineers connected with the Water Branch Office, Calgary, and being shown their drawings and recommendations following their recent visit to the school in question, I decided with their concurrence to go to Brocket and make a further study of the situation on the spot. On the 7th instant, accompanied by the Indian Agent, Mr. Lancaster, I arrived at the school. The Rev. Principal, Father Lavergne, and his school engineer, were present and gave me all the information within their knowledge regarding the matter under discussion. Previous to my arrival at the school I had called on Mr. Stanley Pearson of Pincher Creek, the local plumber, who had done some work in the well since it was drilled. Mr. Pearson stated he had lowered the cylinder and intake pipe to within 10 or 15 feet of the bottom of the well.\n\nThe reports which I had heard of a serious water shortage at this school had not been exaggerated. The well now yields only about 600 gals. a day, which, of course, is hopelessly inadequate. On the day I called I was with difficulty that sufficient water could be obtained for laundry requirements, and as the outside stock had trampled and muddied the spring, there was not enough clean water available to make tea for the children, I was informed.\n\nBy referring to my Diary for 1926, I find that on May 7th of that year the well-driller then at work reached a depth of 300'. I personally conducted a careful bailing test at that time, and water was then bailed at the rate of 415 gals an hour, at which rate it was found impossible to empty the well, there being no of water in the casing at the conclusion of the test. The well-driller and myself estimated the capacity of the well at fully 500 gals an hour, which was ample for all requirements. The drilling ended in a rock formation and is cased all the way down, with perforations in the lowest 60' of casing which is 5\", the rest being 5 5/8\" diameter.\nowing to some cause not yet established this well has been steadily falling off in production, and now only yields little more in 24 hrs than was originally obtained in one hour's pumping.\n\nThere is a weak spring coming out of the rocky depression in the side of a neighboring ridge 1000' distant from the school, which Mr. Fetterly thinks might be developed sufficiently to yield an auxiliary supply of water to the extent of approximately 70 gals an hour. He had the spring dug out to a depth of 6', and satisfied himself by actual test that this amount of water can be obtained. His proposal is to excavate and construct a concrete chamber at the source of said spring, into which the water would be diverted and held by wind extensions and a clay retaining wall. The full details of the scheme will be seen in the drawings already forwarded to Ottawa from the Water Branch. This proposal has one point in its favor, viz that it deals with an existent and visible water supply. It would involve a 1000' trench 6' deep and pipe line and an additional pumping plant, in addition to the excavating and concrete work at the spring. As the spring seepage is out of a much disturbed laminated strata formation there is some slight danger of the water seeking other channels then held back sufficiently to form a dead level break beyond the confines of the proposed works. At best this is but a meagre water supply. Its estimated cost is put at $2000.00 for the complete scheme.\n\nMy own impression is that it would be advisable to drill another well about 8' distant from the outside wall of the boiler room on the chance of tapping the water vein reached when the original well was drilled. I think there is a very strong probability, if not certainty, that we can get this water again though we may have to go a few feet deeper. We cannot depend on the present well owing to its being within the building. Then in the event of recovering the original water supply there should be a pump chamber provided, level with the boiler-room floor, with a doorway between, and roofed by a concrete slab extension of the adjoining coalbin roof, and with an iron door directly over the well. A drilling rig can be set up readily at the place indicated; and should it ever become necessary to do further work at this well, it would be accessible to the drilling rig at any time. This proposed location of the well and pumping chamber is exactly what has been done at the New Blue Mtns School. The total cost should not exceed the estimate for developing the spring. The object of drilling the suggested second well is that there is the element of chance, and in the event of failure to get water the outlay would prove useless, and recourse would then have to be to the spring. But all things considered, I incline strongly to the suggestion of drilling as stated, believing that the original ample supply of water can yet be recovered, and the Rev. Principal fully shares this view.\n\nIf I can be of any further service in this matter I shall be pleased to co-operate in any way desired by the Department.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nE.

O.M.I.\nEdmonton, Alta.\n\nDear Reverend Father Provincial,\n\nI beg to submit you these few lines about a very important matter concerning our school. You are well aware that our water supply has not been very satisfactory for the last three years; during that time, I have been corresponding with the Indian Department, pointing out this poor condition and asking to have it improved. Some experts have been sent here on different occasions, one after another, and they all agreed that something should be done indeed as soon as possible. Finally, in the spring of 1930, I was promised that the work would be done before the winter, but in the following October I was told that they had run short of money, and in order to remedy in some way the lack of sufficient water at the school and the danger of fire, they appointed a night watchman; they assured me at the same time that an item was already put in the Estimates for the purpose and that the work would be done this year as early as possible. In fact, two engineers came, a good while ago, and made a plan to have an outside spring connected with the school; this is a long and hard work, since the spring is over a thousand feet from the house; it could have been done during the fine weather, but it is not started yet; the winter has arrived and it will be almost impossible to do it before the frost is out. In the meantime, we are suffering; the water condition is getting worse than ever, sometimes we cannot even have decent water to make tea, the sewer pipes have been blocked five times already during the last few months, etc.; we can hardly store any amount of water in the pressure tanks and in a case of fire we have no way at all to fight it.\n\nMr. Gardner-Smith, who knows better than anybody else the conditions of this location, came here again on the 7th of last month and suggested to the Department that the simplest and least expensive way to improve our water supply would be to have another well drilled by the house. I have nothing to say in that regard of course; but on the other hand I must state that, if the spring is connected with the school, all the ones who have been on the spot are wondering how it will be possible to prevent the dirt from seeping in from the surrounding hill and contaminating it.\n\nAnyhow, something should be done at once; the situation has become too serious and too dangerous. Therefore, I have thought of writing you today and of asking you to urge the Department to take some action as soon as possible.\n\nYours sincerely in Xto & M.I.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Duncan Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nHonorable Sir:\n\nHere is a letter that speaks for itself; it comes from Rev. Father J.J. Levern, O.M.I., Principal of the Sacred Heart School at Brocket, Alta. It reveals the unsatisfactory and indeed the very dangerous conditions of the water supply in that School.\n\nI visited the place not long ago, I spoke the matter over with the Rev. Principal and I know that your Department is fully aware of the extreme shortage of water in that institution. Orders have been given at different times to study the situation and reports have been sent to Ottawa on the matter. I am of the opinion that the work should be done immediately, because every delay hampers the work of the staff, threatens the health of the children and in case of fire would be the cause of a total loss.\n\nMr. Gardner-Smith advocated the drilling of a new well close to the School, and this is certainly the only way of assuring an ample supply of good and pure water. The spring referred to in Father Levern's letter would not, in my humble opinion, fill the purpose.\n\nI hope, dear Mr. Scott, you'll pardon me for insisting so much on the immediate drilling of this new well; I think that by so doing I am giving you another proof of the keen interest I take in the beautiful work your Department is doing for the Indians.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nH. Langlois\nNovember 24, 1931.\n\nDear Father Langleis:\n\nI have your letter of the 20th instant, enclosing a communication from the Reverend Principal of the Sacred Heart Indian Residential School, relative to improving the water supply system at the school. The Department obtained a report from the Dominion Water Power and Hydrometric Bureau, through their Calgary office, recommending the enlargement of the original spring now in use and stating that a sufficient supply of water will then be available. Authority has been given to the Dominion Water Power Branch to proceed with the work of enlarging the spring and install the necessary pipeline and pump. The Department is informed that instructions have been given to place the work in hand.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nVery Rev. U. Langleis, O. M.

No difficulties will be met in freighting.\n\nNature of Works.\n\nThe works consist of improvement of a spring situated 1000 feet east of the school, a trench and pipeline from said spring to the school and a shallow well pump to be located in the boiler room. Connections are also to be made between the pump and the existing pressure system.\n\nThe contractor will be liable for personal injuries or injury to stock during construction and shall free the Department of Indian Affairs from all responsibility from claims arising therefrom.\nImprovement Works at Spring.\n\nThe bottom of the coulee is to be excavated to a depth of nine feet below its present level for the width shown on the attached plan. The contractor must satisfy himself as to the nature and quantity of the material to be excavated, and to provide himself with the necessary equipment. He must also make provision for disposal of the inflow from the spring during excavation and construction.\n\nThe concrete in the tank shall consist of clean screened gravel, clean sand with the addition of Portland cement in the proportions of one part cement, three parts sand and five parts gravel, except the top slab of the tank which will consist of one, two and four parts, respectively.\n\nThe ends of the reinforcing rods should be wired together where feasible.\n\nTwo wing walls, constructed of two thicknesses of one-inch boards with lapped edges will be constructed from the tank and two shorter plank walls will be constructed at the rear against the sandstone ledge.

H. SCOGALL.\n\nBy, H.L.M.\nSir,\n\nThis will acknowledge receipt of your telegram of the 26th instant, in answer to mine of the same date regarding the tenders submitted by four contractors of the six mentioned in your letter of the 14th instant, for prices of pumping equipment, pipe lines and labour in connection with the proposed Auxiliary Water Supply of Sacred Heart School, Pelican Reserve.\n\nI am sending copies of each tender to you for inspection.\n\nI might state that apparently the majority are not capable of interpreting blue prints correctly. They do not know for instance, that storage batteries require a Direct Current motor which costs $30, more than a single phase motor, or that the elbows, etc., shown on the plan, are included in the contract.\n\nGeo. H. Scougall's tender includes the correct equipment for $660 but does not include the remainder of the contract. He stated over the phone that he would not bid on labour, etc.\n\nW.C. Andrews bid an inclusive amount of $550 without specifying details. It appears evident that he did not include all equipment in his computations.\n\nMcRoberts Company tendered on black (he probably meant iron) pipe, while galvanized pipe is specified. He also tendered on one check valve only. This, together with a device for starting the motor automatically, a magnetic switch - was mentioned in the specifications; but elbows, reducers, etc., were indicated on the plans. He also apparently tendered for a single phase motor instead of a D.C. Motor.\n\nS. Pearson sent a bid for the entire contract for $2734 together with an alternative bid for equipment alone for $612. He also probably bid on a single phase motor in the letter bid.\n\nThe inclusive bid is probably based on the fact that we are now in the winter season with snow and zero weather present. The season is now far advanced. Many difficulties and much expense would be encountered if the material were purchased and the work done by day labour which would necessitate\n\nThe Director,\nWater Power & Hydrometric Bureau,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOttawa.\nthe constant attendance of an engineer or skilled foreman, or both, I deduce from your letter of 14th instant that you intended to follow this method.\n\nThe prices obtained by this office from the Fairbanks-Morse Co. for the equipment aggregates $631.\n\nI would recommend that the inclusive tender of S. Pearson, for $2734, be accepted. You will note from his letter, copy of which is enclosed, that he has had other contracts with the Indian Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. S.

The only expense in connection with the electric light plant has been an overhauling, which was authorized by the Indian Agent. The account of the Pincher Creek Motors, of Pincher Creek, for $20.25 for this service, has been paid.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nOctober 9, 1931.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Buskard\n\nFor some time past the water-supply system for the Sacred Heart Indian Residential School on the Peigan Reserve has not been adequate for this institution. The Dominion Water Power Branch, through their Calgary office, were asked to investigate and submit a report and recommendation. This has been received, and in order to make the supply adequate it will be necessary to improve the original spring now in use. If this is done a sufficient supply of water will be available. Additional pumping equipment and pipe line will be required. The cost of this improvement is estimated at $2040.00. In this year's estimates $2,000.00 has been provided for the work. We are now going to make the necessary change in this water-supply system. The work will be done under the supervision of the Water Power Branch, but I think I should ask for the names of firms where necessary purchases in this connection may be made. It is possible that some of the Peigan Indians may be employed as labourers, but I should know where to secure any extra labour required.\nMinister's Office\n\nNovember 5, 1931\n\nDR.

Connections are also to\nbe made between the pump and the existing pressure system.\n\nThe contractor will be liable for personal\ninjuries or injury to stock during construction and shall free\nthe Department of Indian Affairs from all responsibility from\nclaims arising therefrom.\n\nImprovement Works at Spring\n\nThe bottom of the coulee is to be excavated to a\ndepth of nine feet below its present level for the width shown on the attached plan. The contractor must satisfy himself as to the nature and quantity of the material to be excavated, and to provide himself with the necessary equipment. He must also make provision for disposal of the inflow from the spring during excavation and construction.\n\nThe concrete in the tank shall consist of clean screened gravel, clean sand with the addition of Portland cement in the proportions of one part cement, three parts sand and five parts gravel, except the top slab of the tank which will consist of one, two and four parts, respectively.\n\nThe ends of the reinforcing rods should be wired together where feasible.\n\nTwo wing walls, constructed of two thicknesses of one-inch boards with lapped edges will be constructed from the tank and two shorter plank walls will be constructed at the rear against the sandstone ledge.

He had evidently made a close study of the plans. Hard snow lies in the coulee to a depth of from four to six feet which will have to be cleared away but is included in the contract. Mr. Pearson intends to concentrate on the coulee section while the weather holds.\n\nMr. Pearson requested information regarding interim payments and was informed that they would be dealt with in the usual way.\n\nFather Laverne, the Principal, is exceedingly well pleased with the fact that construction is started.\n\nI am enclosing two copies of the specifications duly signed by Mr. Pearson, no formal contract being necessary, in accordance with your letter of the 14th instant.\n\nYou will be kept informed of the progress of the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.)

Gen. of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\n\nHonorable Sir,\n\nI beg to call again your attention to the condition of water supply at the Indian School, Brocket, Alberta. I understand that a certain Mr. Pearson had lately started some work at the spring near the school site, but owing to weather conditions was obliged to discontinue, and would not resume till next summer.\n\nThe Rev. Principal informs me that at times, for several days, there is not a drop of water to be got from the present well. You easily realize this very deplorable situation in an Indian Residential School, being without a supply of water for heating, cooking, laundry, sanitation, fire-protection, etc.\n\nI know that this very serious matter has been brought to the attention of the Department at different times, and I am aware that Engineers from Calgary had worked on some plan to secure a greater supply of water, since May 1931; but unfortunately nothing was practically done till the beginning of the winter, with the result that everything is again at a stand-still.\n\nTherefore I beg to inquire what the Department intends to do for immediate relief to this precarious situation. In submitting this matter to your serious consideration, I do so in the interest of the School and of the Indian Department.\n\nI remain, Honorable Sir,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\nProvincial.\nPlease report on attached letter and return it to the office of the Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nDo not file.\nJanuary 18, 1932.\n\nDear Mr. Johnston:\n\nI wish to refer to your 41167 of the 26th ultimo, with reference to the water supply for the Sacred Heart Indian Residential School. There is a report that the contractor has discontinued work and does not intend to resume until next summer. If Mr. Tempest's office can do anything to expedite this work under the terms of the contract, this Department would be grateful.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nJ. T. Johnston, Esq.,\nDirector,\nDominion Water Power &\nHydrometric Bureau,\nDept. of the Interior,\nOttawa.\nJanuary 18, 1932.\n\nDear Father Langlois:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, with reference to the water supply at the Sacred Heart Indian Residential School. The Department has received a report to the effect that the contractor began construction with 10 men on the morning of December 21st. The contract includes the clearing away of snow from the valleys where the supply pipe will lie. It is understood that the valley section will be undertaken first, while the weather remains mild, as it was when the work started. The Department's information is that the work would be carried on as fast as weather would permit. In the meantime, it may be necessary for the Reverend Principal to arrange to have water drawn to the school. I am writing to the Dominion Water Power Branch, with a view to seeing that the work is proceeded with whenever possible.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nVery Rev. U. Langlois, O.M.I.,\nOblate Fathers' Prov. House,\n9916 - 110th St.,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nDEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR\nDOMINION WATER POWER AND HYDROMETRIC BUREAU\n\nOTTAWA, ONT., January 21, 1932.\n\nDear Dr. Scott:\n\nI have received your letter of the 16th instant with reference to the water supply for the Sacred Heart Indian Residential School, in which you mention that there is a report that the contractor has discontinued work and does not intend to resume until next summer.\n\nWe have had no information in regard to this project since Mr. Tempest's letter of December 22nd, copy of which was sent to Mr. MacInnes on December 28th. According to this report the work appeared to be well under way, but I have written to Mr. Tempest sending him a copy of your letter and asking him to do everything that is necessary to expedite this work under the terms of the agreement with the contractor.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nDr. Duncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nPlease be advised that I have received a letter from S. Pearson, Contractor, of Pincher Creek, Alta., with reference to the progress of construction on the Auxiliary Water Supply System at Sacred Heart School on the Pelican Reserve near Brocket, Alta.\n\nHe states that the bad weather has retarded the work. He began construction on December 21 by removing fifteen feet of snow from the spring. He then constructed a fence 250 long by 4 feet high, probably to the south west. This was found on January 16th to be largely effective in holding the snow.\n\nThe lumber, cement, reinforcing iron, etc., has been hauled to the school. The discovery and hauling of rock and gravel is rendered difficult by snow and snowdrifts.\n\nHe has begun construction at the spring and will work towards the school, testing as he advances.\n\nIt is obviously impossible to enforce the time limit because of the heavy falls of snow and below-zero weather which has occurred. Mr. Pearson is advancing the work as fast as is possible. His letter finishes as follows: \"I will let you know in the near future how the work is progressing, and I expect to have considerable of the work done at the spring, for you to inspect\".\n\nMr. Fetterly will make the first inspection very shortly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.)

Tempest\n\nReceived payment\nFebruary 6, 1932\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that an inspection was made of progress on construction of the Auxiliary Water Supply System at Sacred Heart School, Pelican Reserve, near Brocket, Alta., by P.A. Betterly of this Bureau, on February 2 and 3.\n\nHe reports conditions to be as follows:\n\nWeather Conditions\n\nThe weather from Dec. 21 until the present (February 8) has been cold and stormy; the thermometer standing below zero almost continuously. The inspection was made in a blizzard. Operations for the first two weeks were confined entirely to removing the accumulated snow with which the coulee was filled to a depth of fifteen feet.\n\nWork Days\n\nThe contractor was instructed on December 19 to begin work, which he did on Dec. 21 with six men. They worked from Dec. 21 to 31 and Jan. 20 to 29. Blizzard conditions and temperature were too severe from Jan. 1 to 20 to work. The temperature fell to 20 or 30 degrees below zero on Jan. 29, and has continued to a similar extent to the present. The men could work only part of the time while on the job. The pump and hose for draining the excavation became frozen if pumping ceased for a minute. If the fair weather of Jan. 29 had continued one more day the forms and concrete could have been prepared.\n\nWork Completed (Temporary)\n\nA temporary fence 450 feet long and 4 feet high was built on the west and south sides about 150 feet from the spring. A snowdrift 50 ft. wide and 6 ft. high has formed on the inside of the fence, which is being continuously replenished by fresh storms and drifting. The coulee itself, however, is now being kept reasonably clear. Everything in\n\nThe Director,\nWater Power & Hydrometric Bureau,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOTTAWA.\nthe vicinity of the spring is frozen. A temporary fence is erected around the excavation every time it is temporarily abandoned.\n\n**Work Completed. (Permanent)**\n\n1. Reinforcing Steel, now on the location, Value $38\n2. Lumber \" \" \" \" \" \" 60\n3. Excavation. An excavation 40 ft. by 4 to 13 ft. by 8 or 9 feet deep has been made at the spring. The material consisted of sandstone and shale; a clay ledge was found at 6 ft. depth, 90 cu.yds. 110\n4. Stone. 26 cu.yds.of clean rock have been gathered. Some of this is placed. 40\n\n**TOTAL:** $265\n\n**Progress of the Work**\n\nMr. Stanley Pearson, the Contractor, of Fincher Creek, Alta., has paid out about $250 in wages, a considerable amount of which is for snow removal, and new fences. He has paid out over $400 altogether. He has no intention of ceasing work until finished. Delay is caused entirely by bad weather. Mr. Pearson stated candidly that he did not know how soon the pipeline could be completed. The frost has penetrated at least three feet since November 24; the date of his estimate, due to lack of snow cover. The frost was then at 8 inches. It would cost him $2000 to excavate the trench now.\n\nIn addition, if concrete were poured, and a trench were excavated and backfilled with frozen soil, during the existing conditions, faulty construction would surely occur. It was very evident that Mr. Pearson is trying to do everything possible under adverse conditions and is working against great difficulties. It is obviously impossible to force him to finish during a time limit.\n\n**Father Laverne's Statement**\n\nFather Laverne, the Principal, stated that he was quite satisfied that it was impossible to continue the work during the very cold weather and was surprised at the amount of work under the prevailing conditions. He stated that in his belief it would be impossible to excavate the trench until the frost withdrew from the ground. He can continue drawing the water from the spring in barrels as before, until the pump is installed.\n\nHowever, he is much concerned with the fire hazard. He states that he had a night watchman last year to\nminimize the fire hazard and to look after the heating system, but that this is not the case at present.\n\nHe states that the complaint regarding non-completion of the work probably came from the Oblate Superior in Edmonton, who was apparently concerned with the fire hazard.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe delay in completion is not due to the contractor. He has carried on as well as can be expected, in the opinion of Father Laverne and myself. He can only work in fair weather, but he does expect to do this. Winter equipment for handling concrete and excavation is expensive and only of practical use on a large project.\n\nRecommendations\n\nIt is recommended that an interim payment of $200 be made to Mr. Pearson for the material hauled and the work completed to date.\n\nThe matter of a night watchman is left entirely in the hands of the Indian Department. Father Laverne requested that it be mentioned in this communication.\n\nI am enclosing a certificate of work done and interim recommendations for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nCommissioner of Irrigation.\nSir:\n\nWith reference to the water supply system now being installed at the Sacred Heart Indian Residential School on the Peigan Reserve, I enclose herewith copy of a report received from the Commissioner of Irrigation describing the progress which has been made with this work.\n\nThere is also enclosed in duplicate certificate for the payment of $200. to Stanley Pearson, the contractor. I presume that this payment will be made direct to Mr. Pearson.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nEncs.\n\nT. R. L.

Scott,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to address you these few lines in connexion with the work which has been authorized and is already started to improve the water supply at our school.\n\nFour years ago, we built a dam across the coulee at a little distance from the spring in order to gather all the water running from it and to form a pond for our stock. This artificial pond has given perfect satisfaction; our horses and cattle have always found there sufficient water to drink, and we never had to pump for them. But now that the spring is going to be piped to the school, we will lose that outside supply; the pond will be dry very soon, and we will have to pump for the stock as well as for the house.\n\nTherefore there must be a special pipe line from our pressure tanks to a certain place in the field or the yard where the water can be pumped into a trough, and I beg to make the present application for this extra work. I understand indeed that times are hard and money scarce; but on the other hand I must say also that the fact of losing this pond and being obliged to pay much heavier gasoline bills from now on is already such a great disadvantage that I feel quite justified in asking for this supplementary expenditure.\n\nThis pipe line may be laid along the other pipe line in the same trench; it will take about seven hundred feet of 6\" pipe costing $10.50 a hundred feet, a few elbows and other fittings and two taps, and a 16 foot trough made of 2 x 10\" planks that will cost between nine and ten dollars. Consequently I do not believe that the whole installation will cost much more than a hundred dollars, if it is done with the present work.\n\nFeeling confident that you will be able to make provision for this needed expenditure, and thanking you again most sincerely for the numerous past favours, I remain, dear Sir,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\nThe Catholic Missions Episcopal Committee\nFor the North West and Hudson's Bay\n\nAGENTS:\nRev.

I have all the materials on the job with the exception of the gravel, and the pump. I expect to have the pump in about one weeks time, and the gravel also if the weather stays fine so we can haul.\n\nWhen Mr. Fetterly comes down, will you ask him to bring his level? so I can get the grade for the pipe line correctly.\n\nI can assure you that I am going ahead with the work, now that the weather has broken, as quickly as possible, and if the weather stays fine expect to finish the contract by the end of the month.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(SGD) STANLEY PEARSON.\nSir,\n\nWith reference to the water supply system now being installed at the Sacred Heart Indian Reserve School on the Peigan Reserve, I enclose herewith copy of a letter written by Mr. Pearson to the Commissioner of Irrigation, from which you will note that he expects to finish this work about the end of this month.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nA.F. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir,\n\nPlease be advised that Mr. Fetterly found it imperative that he inspect the works in connection with the Auxiliary Water Supply System at Sacred Heart Indian School on the Biggar Reserve near Brocket, Alta., during the present week. The Commissioner had let it be known that he wished to obtain the exact location of the pipe trench and the depth of the pipe at intervals along the 940 feet of pipe immediately. Although no expense money was available, the trip was absolutely necessary. Mr. Fetterly, in the absence of orders, but after consultation with me, proceeded to Brocket on April 14th, paying his own expenses with the hope that he would be reimbursed by the Indian Department.\n\nHe made an inspection of the work, gave Mr. Pearson the necessary instructions, grades, etc., and returned to Calgary on April 18th.\n\nHe ascertained that Mr. Pearson is very conscientiously completing an excellent piece of work. The development of the spring is completed with the exception of the earth covering. About half of the trench has been excavated and a portion of the pipe laid. All of the material is on the ground with the exception of the pump which is now on its way from Winnipeg and should arrive within a day or two.\n\nThe flow of the spring is even now more than was estimated owing to the method of development and should amount to at least 2000 gallons per day. It rose 24 inches in the tank and reservoir during the 24 hours during which Mr. Fetterly was present.\n\nFather LaVerne is now enthusiastic regarding the general development although at the time the design was prepared he was sceptical of the use of the spring as a source, the design and size of the tank, etc., Mr. Fetterly is completely satisfied with the general results.\n\nThe installation should be completed within three weeks at the latest, although Mr. Pearson stated that he could probably finish by the end of April.\n\nThe Director,\nWater Power & Hydrometric Bureau,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOttawa.\nIt will, of course, be necessary to inspect the completed works; consequently I would suggest that a request be made to the Indian Department for an advance for expenses of Thirty dollars ($30) for the visit of this week and the next and last trip.\n\nAs Mr. Pearson has spent a large amount of money to date in material and wages, I am enclosing a certificate for interim payment to be made immediately, comprised as follows:\n\n- Concrete tank $300\n- Excavation 120\n- Stone and gravel fill 50\n- Clay Fill 40\n- Lumber 80\n- Lattice Cover 5\n- Trench 125\n- Paint & primer for pipe 10\n- Painting pipe 10\n- 950' pipe @ 31.69 per 100' $316.00\n\nTotal $1056.90\n\nAs an interim payment of $200 has already been made I would suggest that an immediate additional payment of six hundred dollars ($600) be made as per enclosed certificate.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.) O. H. Hoover,\nActing District Chief Engineer.\nSir,\n\nReferring to my letter of February 16th, 1932, regarding the installation of the water supply system at the Sacred Heart Indian Residential School on the Pelican Reserve, I enclose copy of a letter dated April 16th received from Mr. O.H. Hoover, the engineer now in charge of the Calgary district of our Bureau, reporting further progress on this work.\n\nThe progress certificate, in duplicate, mentioned in Mr. Hoover's letter, is enclosed herewith, showing a further payment of $800 to be due the Contractor, Stanley Pearson, of Pincher Creek, Alberta. Will you kindly arrange payment of this amount direct to Mr. Pearson.\n\nIt will be further noted from Mr. Hoover's letter that Mr. Fetterly of his staff has made one trip this fiscal year to the work, and a further trip will be necessary to inspect the completed work. Mr. Hoover asks that he be advanced $300.00 to cover costs of these trips, and provides his request meets with your approval, I would ask that a cheque in Mr. Hoover's favour for the above mentioned amount be forwarded to the undersigned for delivery.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T.

The\nconcrete tank is well and strongly constructed according\nto the plans. The concrete mixture is richer than was demanded in the specifications. The reinforcement is also according to specifications. The rock-filled portion is filled with clean rocks, stones and gravel collected in the field. The sandstone and shale from the excavation was not used. The collecting pipes and overflow pipe were placed. The lumber was used as detailed in the plans and specifications. The clay and earth fills were also constructed. The whole of this portion of the contract was completed in a workmanlike manner, the Contractor taking a great deal of pains. The water enclosed by the tank is clear and clean.\n\nThe capacity of the tank at the spring between the check valve on the outlet pipe and the overflow pipe is over 6000 gallons, equal to more than three days' run of the spring. This amount should be ample for all purposes and should provide a reserve supply for fire or other emergency necessities. The water rises in the spring tank about 18 inches per day if none be used.\n\nPine Line\n\nA trench 950 feet long was excavated to an average depth of 6'6\" from the spring tank to the pump at the school. The pipe is primed and painted and all joints carefully made. An extra 3/4\" pipe was laid in this trench from the school to the hog corral with two stand pipes for watering the stock. This latter pipe was laid at the request of Father Laverne, the Principal, and\nwas not included in this contract. It was purchased by\nthe school at no expense to the Indian Department. This\ntrench is now filled in, a ridge one foot high being left\nto compensate for future settling of the earth.\n\nThe Contractor drew the water along the pipe\nby means of a hand pump during construction in order to\ndisclose any leaks which might exist. The progressive tests\nwere successful.\n\nPump at the School\n\nA Typhoon shallow well pump, rated at 600 U.S.\ngallons per hour, is installed in the Boiler Room. This is\nconnected by means of pipes to the existing pressure system\nin the engine room. The pump was first used on the evening\nof May 11, and, the pressure tanks being nearly empty, they\nwere filled at a computed rate of nearly 750 Imperial gallons\nper hour.\n\nAn automatic stop switch is installed. The\nmaximum at present is set at 40 pounds. The starting will\nbe done by hand, i.e., by manipulation of a switch. The pump\nis driven by a 1 h.p. motor actuated from the existing power\nsystem.\n\nThe pump being located in the boiler room under\nthe steps, it was suggested to rather Laverne that he enclose\nthe installation in order to protect the machinery of the\npump. This was not included in the contract as the cost could\nbe met by causing the school engineer to do this in his spare\ntime.\n\nExtras\n\nThe Contractor was instructed at the beginning of\nthe work that no extras would be allowed as everything necessary was included in the plans and specifications. This rule was adhered to with one exception. The relief valve and gate valve used in connection with the deep well pump were expected, at the time the design was prepared, to act for both pumps. The writer was advised, however, on good authority, that these relief valves frequently wear out and need replacing. If these existing valves had been used for both systems it would be found that water from the spring pump would be liable to be driven into the deep well, if and when the deep well relief valve leaked. Consequently the Contractor was instructed to install extra valves between the new pump and the pressure tanks at a cost of $11.75 as shown on the certificate. The invoice, duly \"O.K'd\" is attached.\n\nAnother possible necessary extra consists of a gate valve on the horizontal line of pipe in the spring tank just above the elbow and nearer the pump. This may be needed if the vertical section of pipe is ever disconnected to replace or repair the check valve near the bottom of the spring tank, in order to prevent the pipe from being emptied of water while being repaired. This, however, should not be needed for a long time and is not absolutely necessary as the pipe could be plugged.\n\nThe Deep Well\n\nThis well appears to have almost entirely failed. The School Engineer pumped at this well for 1\u00bd hours on the evening of May 11 and did not obtain a drop of water.\nThe reason for this is not known. The bottom of the casing may be filled up or the water supply may have disappeared, probably the former. However, removal of the pipe and examination of the well would be expensive with no guarantee that it would not occur again. The deep well has been sunk for a few years only. This deep well may recover in time and some water should always be available from it.\n\nThe pressure tanks were empty when the shallow well pump began to function. The school authorities were drawing nearly all their water from the spring in barrels. If the writer had recommended the sinking of another deep well near the school, as he was advised by several interested parties, it might function in a similar manner to that of the present deep well. They now have an abundant visible supply of good water, easily accessible, for school and stock. Father Laverne has one objection to the system, viz: that the large open reservoir between the dam and the spring will not receive as much water as formerly through the overflow pipe. The answers to these objections are obvious. The final inspection was made on May 12. The delay in sending a final certificate is due to the necessity for proving the efficiency of the work during a period of time.\n\nRecommendations.\n\nI would recommend that Stanley Pearson, of Pincher Creek, Alberta, the Contractor, be paid the final\nsum of One thousand nine Hundred and Forty-Five Dollars and seventy-five Cents ($1945.75) being the balance due on completion of his Contract. This sum, together with a certificate for $200 issued on February 8, 1932, and one for $600 issued on April 23, 1932, comprises the total contract price of $2734.00, together with extras of $11.75 as per enclosed invoice, in triplicate, duly \"O.K'd\".\n\n(SIGNED) P. A. FETTERLY.\n\nJune 1, 1932.\nSir,\n\nIn further reference to my letter of April 27th regarding the installation of the auxiliary water supply system at the Sacred Heart Indian Residential School on the Peigan Reserve, I enclose herewith a report describing the system as constructed, signed by Mr. A. Petterly as Inspector, together with copy of a letter from the Principal of the school, Father Larouche, stating that the work is satisfactory. There is also enclosed, in duplicate, final certificate covering the payment to the Contractor, Stanley Pearson, of $1,945.75. The amount of the contract was $2,734.00, and the balance due was $888.25, which has been paid to $11.75, for a relief valve and gate valve, the necessity for which is explained in Mr. Petterly's report. A voucher, in triplicate, covering this extra is enclosed. I beg to recommend that the final payment on this contract be made to Mr. Pearson, in accordance with the certificate herewith.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nEncl.\n\nJ. T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nA.

MacKenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n| Cheque or Voucher No. | Day of Month | Remarks                  | Gasoline | Lubricants | Cost of New Tires | Cost of Tire Repair | Cost of Repairs Not Including Tires | Labour | Material | Accessories | Landscaping | Storage | Overhead |\n|-----------------------|--------------|--------------------------|----------|------------|------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------|--------|----------|-------------|-------------|---------|----------|\n| M1                    |              | Mr. Smith's Calgary Repair|          |            |                  |                    |                               |        |          |             |             |         |          |\n| M2                    |              | Mr. Smith's Calgary Repair|          |            |                  |                    |                               |        |          |             |             |         |          |\n| M3                    |              | Mr. Smith's Calgary Repair|          |            |                  |                    |                               |        |          |             |             |         |          |\n| M4                    |              | Mr. Smith's Calgary Repair|          |            |                  |                    |                               |        |          |             |             |         |          |\n| M5                    |              | Mr. Smith's Calgary Repair|          |            |                  |                    |                               |        |          |             |             |         |          |\n| M6                    |              | Mr. Smith's Calgary Repair|          |            |                  |                    |                               |        |          |             |             |         |          |\n| M7                    |              | Mr. Smith's Calgary Repair|          |            |                  |                    |                               |        |          |             |             |         |          |\n| M8                    |              | Mr. Smith's Calgary Repair|          |            |                  |                    |                               |        |          |             |             |         |          |\n| M9                    |              | Mr. Smith's Calgary Repair|          |            |                  |                    |                               |        |          |             |             |         |          |\n| M10                   |              | Mr. Smith's Calgary Repair|          |            |                  |                    |                               |        |          |             |             |         |          |\n\n**Totals**\n\n- Non-Stock: $411.24\n- Stock: $83.60\n- Grand Total: $494.84\n\nSubmitted by: P.A.

Will you kindly forward cheque in favour of the Receiver General for the above amount at your earliest convenience.\n\nYours truly,\n\nFinancial Controller.\n\nChief Accountant,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nOttawa, December 7, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Reverend J. L. Levern, O.M.I., Principal of the Sacred Heart Indian Residential School, who visited the Department today, discussed the question of fire hazard at the school.\n\nIn the case of several of our residential schools, the Department has provided a grant, at the rate of $40 per month, towards the salary of a night watchman. Father Levern has been instructed to engage an competent man as night watchman and the Department has agreed to allow him a grant at the above rate for the watchman's services during the winter months, from approximately October first to April 30th in each year. As the watchman will likely begin duties only about the middle of the season, the grant at the above rate will be allowed from the day he begins. The grant will be paid upon receipt of a voucher from you in triplicate, properly certified, at the end of each quarter, for the amount due at the above rate. For your information, I enclose a copy of a voucher which it is desired you submit.\n\nThe Department is today placing an order with the Canadian Fairbanks-Morse Company Limited, here, to supply from their hardware branch office to the school, one (1) only D-2 Watchman's clock, complete with ten stations, and one year's supply of records disk. This company has been requested to forward the clock, charges prepaid, to the Reverend Principal and to forward to you the account, in triplicate, covering the cost, with receipt for freight charges prepaid. When the clock is received, you should attach the account to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment.\n\nIt is expected that the school authorities will engage the services of a reliable night watchman. I shall be pleased if you will inform the Department of the name, qualifications, etc., of the man engaged and the date upon which he begins duties.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nH. G. Lancaster, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBrocket, Alta.\nOttawa, December 7, 1932.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nI have to request that you will supply, from your nearest branch office, for the use of the Sacred Heart Indian Residential School, Brocket, Alberta, one (1) only D-P Watchman's clock, complete, with ten stations, and also one year's supply of record dials. The clock should be shipped, charges prepaid, addressed to:\n\nReverend J. L. Levern, O. M. I.,\nPrincipal,\nSacred Heart Indian Residential School,\nBrocket, Alta.\n\nYour account, in triplicate, covering the cost, together with receipt for the shipping charges prepaid, should be forwarded to Mr. H. C. Lancaster, Indian Agent, Brocket, Alta. He is being informed of the order placed with you and requested, upon receipt of the clock, if in good condition, to certify the account and send it to the Department for payment.\n\nThis clock should be supplied at a cost not to exceed the price charged for other clocks which have been ordered from your firm by this Department. Full instructions should be furnished.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary,\nCanadian Fairbanks-Morse Co., Ltd.,\n266 Sparks St.,\nOttawa.\nSacred Heart Indian Residential School, Brocket, Alta.,\nDecember 31, 1932\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to our conversation of the 7th inst. in your office, I beg to thank you first for your kindness, which has touched me so much, and to offer you my best wishes for the New Year.\n\nNow: I. Concerning our icehouse trouble, I spoke to you about an expert's plan to improve it; but, after having considered the matter again, we have come to the conclusion that even with this costly improvement it is still doubtful that it will give satisfaction: a frigidaire is the only thing that will answer the purpose, whenever it will be possible to have it.\n\nII.-With regard to the night watchman, I regret to say that I was not able to get him before yesterday; he is here at last, his name is \"Brother L. Guillaume\", a good and capable man, 60 years old. The clock which you have kindly sent us and for which I thank you has arrived and the ten stations are hung and screwed in the different rooms of the house.\n\nNow, although I am very glad to have a night watchman, I must say also that we are now without any room at all for the visitors and even without a parlor: the parlor is the only place where we can put him. When the school was in construction I made a remark about the insufficient accommodation for the staff and suggested that a partition in the large parlor in order to have one more room. This was refused, but now I beg to repeat it: this parlor is 19 feet by 12\u00bd and therefore after being divided it will still be large enough. A good carpenter from Pincher Creek (Mr. Ouellette) is willing to do this work at once for about $65.00.\n\nConsequently, I beg to ask the Department to allow an immediate grant for that purpose.\n\nExpecting a satisfactory answer and thanking you in anticipation, I remain, dear Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nForwarded through Piya [signature] Office\nH.

The above amount is to include the cost of material and labour. After the work has been completed to your satisfaction, you should prepare an itemized account, in triplicate, showing the various quantities of material used, the number of days or hours of labour employed and the rate paid. This account, you should hand to Mr. H. C. Lancaster, Indian Agent, who is being informed of the authority granted you to incur the above expenditure. It is hoped that, with the services of the night watchman, any chance of fire hazard will be eliminated.\n\nThe Department has noted the need of a frigidaire, but, in this connection, I have to say that it is very doubtful if funds for the purpose can be provided in the Estimates for the next fiscal year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Fran\u00e7ois O.M.S.\nTranslation\n\nBrocket, Alta. Dec. 31st 1933.\n\nMr. Lutheland\nSuperintendent of Indian Education.\n\nDear Mr. Lutheland,\n\nI am at the present moment at the Sacred Heart School of the Piegans on the Brocket reserve. The school functions very well; everything seems to be prosperous, and I believe the Department has reason to be glad of the work of the staff and of the good result which has crowned their efforts.\n\nThere is however a very serious matter on which I wish to draw your attention; it is that of the water supply. They suffer much here from the lack of water, for the first necessities of the school itself as well as for the needs of the stable.\n\nSince 1928, numerous complaints were addressed to the Department about this question; the water supply has never been sufficient; at a certain moment of the year, the school was practically without water. The well gives hardly any water and the source itself is almost dry; water comes out of it only intermittently and in small quantities. You can imagine the inconvenience and the dangers of all kinds that might happen for an institution of that importance.\n\nOn account of lack of water it is impossible to give the children their weekly bath and that since September; for the same want of water the sewer pipes get continually clogged and sometimes we cannot use the O.T.O. Yet I can assure you that everyone tries to economize the water as much as possible. There is just enough on certain days to supply the kitchens and prevent the cattle from suffering from thirst.\nDo you not believe that this state of affairs should not be tolerated any longer? We are running great risks and in spite of all precautions taken by the staff, very little can be done to prevent such irresponsible misfortune. I consequently take the liberty of insisting with you and the Superintendent General, Mr. McCall, so that effective remedy be brought immediately to the situation. The real remedy would be the digging of a good well. This part of the country is too much exposed to droughts to depend on surface water which flows here and there small streams during the rainy years and in the spring. It was out of these sources that we tried to rely in 1937, by expensive work to which Mr. Smith was opposed because he only had confidence in a good well which would have pumped the necessary water from a reasonable depth. It might be sufficient to clean the present well and to dig it further down, if this is possible. What is certain is that the quantity of water it supplies now is insufficient and that steps must be taken by the Department immediately.\n\nI know that complaints were made to Mr. Principal, Mr. Laverne, regarding a too numerous herd. It is the first time to my knowledge that I hear complaints against a Principal who wishes the complete success of his farm and wants to possess a herd that would dispense the school from procuring its necessary meat outside. He made great sacrifices to bring up that herd which evidently needs much improvement yet; but it seems to me by doing so, that we were fulfilling the wishes often expressed by the Department and give at the same time a chance to the school to supply itself.\n\nWe do not believe the the number of cattle is exaggerated and we would regret very much to see the Department by refusing to give the school\nthe convenient water and grazing land, remove from it a good portion of its resources which were permitted to give full satisfaction.\n\nI think believe dear Mr. Hutchison, in the expression of my high consideration and accept my best wishes of health, happiness and success for the New Year.\n\n(Signed) W. Langlois\n\nO.W.S.\nOttawa, January 2, 1934.\n\nDear Father Langlois:\n\nI have your letter of the 21st ultimo, with reference to the present condition of the water supply at the Sacred Heart Indian Residential School on the Peigan reserve. I was rather surprised to learn of the lack of water at this school, as, some two years ago, the Department expended the sum of approximately $3,000 in the installation of an auxiliary water supply system - the work being carried out by the Dominion Water Power and Hydrometric Bureau in Calgary. This supply, as you are aware, was obtained from a spring and piped to the school. It was stated, at that time, that it could supply 5,000 gallons per day, which amount was ample for all purposes and for providing a reserve supply for fire or other emergencies.\n\nI may add that your letter is the first information received regarding the present condition of the water supply. No doubt, this is due, to a very great extent, to the very limited rainfall during the past summer. It is possible that a good supply of water could be obtained from the former deep well, if it were placed in good condition. This well was examined at the time the work of installing the pipeline from the spring was performed, and the authorities of the Dominion Water Power Branch stated, at that time, that this well appeared to have almost entirely failed.\n\nHowever, I may add that the Department is taking up with Mr. Inspector Christianson the matter of the water supply. He is being requested to submit a report with reference to drilling a new well and an estimate of the costs involved; further, that as the Department had no recent intimation regarding the inadequacy of the water supply at this school, provision has been made in the Estimates for funds to carry out any work in drilling a new well or for other means of obtaining a supply of water.\n\nWhen a report is received from the Inspector, consideration will be given as to what work can be carried out to augment the present water service at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. U. Langlois, O.M.I.,\nOblate Fathers' Prov. House,\n9916 - 110th Street,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nOttawa, January 2, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nA communication has been received from Very Rev. Father Langlois, O.M.I., Provincial of the Oblate Order, in Edmonton, with reference to the condition of the water supply at the Sacred Heart Indian Residential School, on the Peigan reserve. He states that the school is suffering much from lack of water, both for school purposes and for the stock.\n\nAs you are, no doubt, aware, in the summer of 1932, the Department incurred considerable expense in installing a water supply system at this school - which work was carried out by the Dominion Water Power Branch. It consisted of the constructing of a concrete collecting tank at a spring and piping a distance of 950 feet to the school. It also included connections with the existing pressure system from a well.\n\nNo doubt, the present condition is due to a great extent to the small quantity of rainfall during the past summer, and it may be that, under more favourable conditions, an ample supply of water could be obtained from the spring.\n\nFather Langlois, in consultation with the Principal, recommends that either the present old well be dug out and deepened or that a new well be drilled.\n\nI would request that you investigate the water conditions at this school and submit a report. Please make a recommendation concerning what should be done to improve the water system, giving an estimate of the cost. It might be advisable for you to consult the local representative of the Dominion Water Power Branch in Calgary. Father Langlois is being informed that the question of the water supply at the Sacred Heart School is being considered for your report. I may add that, as a complaint regarding the water supply at this school has been received since the work mentioned above was carried out in the summer of 1932, no funds have been provided in the Estimates for the coming fiscal year to cover any expenditure in improving the system.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Of course we will have to depend on fine weather to go down there so it may be some time before I am able to furnish the department with a full report. I trust this will be satisfactory.\n\nIn the meantime I would think that the school has sufficient water as this winter there has been a lot of snow in the northern part of the province and several chinooks which has melted the snow. Of course when you take into consideration that the school has approximately 100 head of live stock and that that number of cattle require a great deal of water, there is some possibility of the school being short of water.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.

Lancaster,\nIndian Agent, Brocket.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYou remember that two weeks ago I spoke to you about the alarm we got here at the school one morning at a quarter past five: a few minutes after the engine had been started, the Sisters in charge of the girls remarked in the dormitory some sparks around the # sewer ventilator, just under the metal ceiling. She ran down at once to the chapel to tell me about it; I went up and saw sparks indeed between that pipe and the metal ceiling, while we were hearing a sonorous noise on the roof. I gave order to stop the engine immediately, and then the sparks ceased very soon, and the fierce wind went down at about the same time: our trouble was all over. As soon as the daylight came, we examined all the wires' connections between the ceiling and the roof, but we could find nothing wrong.\n\nWe were still wondering what might have caused those sparks, when on Christmas day Mrs Bad Eagle asked me what was the meaning of the very big light which she saw from her house, one morning, on top of the roof of the School: Before I could answer, Miss Mike One Owl and her mother, who were sitting near her, exclaimed at once: \"Oh! Yes, we have seen that big light also from Nathan Many Feathers' house.\" This has given us an explanation of the big noise we heard while we were looking at the sparks: we thought it was due to the fierce wind blowing on the west fire escape or the revolving ventilator on top of the dormitory; but, in fact, it was caused by the flames rushing out of the sewer ventilator.\n\nBut this has not explained the cause of the accident: Is there any place under the roof where the insulation cover of the electric wires has been rubbed off under the pressure of the wind shaking the building, establishing thus a short circuit? We hardly think so; or was it just the gas escaping from the sewer? This is what some experts claim, and they suggest that two high ventilators should be put on the sewer pipe line in order to let the gas escape, and to prevent the repetition of the same accident. When this happened there was six inches of snow on the roof, otherwise the whole building would have been burnt. Such is the reason why I have considered it my duty to write you, so that you may submit the matter to the Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(signed) J.L.

C'est pourquoi j'ai d\u00fb attendre jusqu'\u00e0 ce jour pour accuser r\u00e9ception de votre communication.\n\nVous voudrez bien lire les deux lettres ci-jointes qui vous diront que si le D\u00e9partement n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 au courant de la situation, ce n'\u00e9tait pas de la faute du R.P. Principal. \u00c0 ce propos, permettez-moi d'ajouter que ce qui vient de se passer \u00e0 Brocket n'est pas un cas unique dans l'histoire de nos relations avec les Agents du D\u00e9partement sur les r\u00e9serves. Ils ont peut-\u00eatre trop d'autorit\u00e9 en mains, et de ce fait trop d'influence sur les Indiens, pour ne pas \u00eatre parfois tent\u00e9s d'en abuser et de s'en servir dans un esprit de favoritisme peu compatible avec leur charge.\n\nVous verrez d'apr\u00e8s la lettre du R.P. Levern (l'actuellement, depuis quelques jours, le puits fournit une bonne provision d'eau; il en est ainsi chaque ann\u00e9e, \u00e0 partir du milieu de l'hiver jusqu'au milieu de l'\u00e9t\u00e9 environ. Ensuite il s'ass\u00e8che presque compl\u00e8tement. Ceci portait le R.P. Principal \u00e0 croire que si le puits pouvait \u00eatre nettoy\u00e9 comme il faut et remis en excellent \u00e9tat, nous n'aurions plus, cher M. Sutherland, \u00e0 vous ennuyer avec cette question.\n\nVous remarquerez aussi qu'en d\u00e9sespoir de cause le P. Levern a tent\u00e9 lui-m\u00eame de creuser un puits. Je n'ai pas approuv\u00e9 cette mani\u00e8re de faire; mais je comprends qu'on en vienne \u00e0 des d\u00e9terminations comme celle-l\u00e0 lorsque, pendant des mois, on est menac\u00e9 d'une disette d'eau extr\u00eamement dangereuse. C'est ainsi que vers la mi-janvier de cette ann\u00e9e le feu a pris\ndans les \u00e9gouts, par suite de l'accumulation des gaz qu'un bon courant d'eau ne vient pas r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement chass\u00e9s. On a peur un moment que toute l'Ecole n'y pass\u00e2t.\n\nJ'esp\u00e8re que cette question finira par se r\u00e9gler au plus grand avantage de tous les int\u00e9ress\u00e9s, et, en attendant, je vous prie de croire \u00e0 mes meilleurs sentiments,\n\n[Signature]\n\nM. Ranglois\nTranslation\n\nBrocket, Alta., Jan 28th 1934\n\nRev. J. A. Langlois, Rev. C.M.S.\nEdmonton.\n\nRev. and dear Provincial Father,\n\nI received your good letter of the 17th together with a copy of the reply from Ottawa, dated the 2nd inst., and I thank you very heartily.\n\nNow I wish to bring out two sentences of that letter: \"I was rather surprised to learn of the lack of water at this school\" \u2014 \"I may add that your letter is the first information received regarding the present condition of the water supply.\" There is a mystery in this for me; judge it by yourself, after you read my letter of the 23rd August to Mr. Lancaster, of which you will find a copy attached herewith.\n\nAbout two weeks after I gave this letter to Mr. Lancaster, I received from him this verbal answer: \"The Department replies that we can not do anything for your cattle; you have too many of them, sell some of them and pay Mr. Stovall yourself.\" \u2014 Verbal answer such as it has become a habit at the office at Brocket for a long time, when it concerns correspondence with Ottawa.\n\nHowever, if Mr. Lancaster has really brought my letter to the attention of the Department (letter of the 23rd August), the surprise mentioned above comes from a simple omission, and it would not be true that \"your letter is the first information received regarding the condition of the water supply.\"\n\nI prefer not to make any other comments.\n\nMr. Christianson came with Mr. Settler, Engineer of Calgary, during my trip to Edmonton. As I told you the well has come to life again, and happens every winter for two or three months.\nThis is not consequently our reason to tell us that we have water in abundance, because our long experience is there to warn us that we must be ready to melt snow again, if there is any, not only for the cattle, but also for the needs of the school.\n\nYou have seen yourself, when you came to visit us last December, that judging the situation desperate after being turned down by Mr. Macleod, and in presence of our lack of water, I was forced to rent a machine for digging wells; we made two attempts, they were unsuccessful so far, and expensive and painful to accomplish, but in justice, should not the Department refund at least this expenditure?\n\nThis is all for the present. We are all well.\n\nYour humble brother in O.T. and M.S.,\n[signature]\nJ. P. Reeves\n\n[signature]\nO.M.J. Dunn\nPrincipal\nTranslation\n\nEdmonton, Alta., Feb. 3, 1934\n\nMr. G. S. Luthersland\nChief, Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Luthersland,\n\nAt the time I received your good letter of the 2nd January last concerning the insufficiency of the water supply at the Indian school at Sacred Heart at Brocket, Alta., I was not in a position to give you any further information. That is why I had to wait until now to acknowledge the receipt of your communication.\n\nYou will kindly read the two letters enclosed herewith, which will tell you that if the Department was not informed of the situation, it was not the fault of the Rev. Father Principal. About this matter, permit me to add that what has just happened at Brocket is not a unique incident in the history of our relations with the Agents of the Department on reserves. They have perhaps too much authority on hand, and on this account too much influence on the Indians, and are evidently tempted at times to abuse of it and make use of it in a spirit of favoritism which is not compatible with the instructions.\n\nYou will see by the letter of Rev. Father Lavern that for a few days past the well has been supplying a good provision of water. It is the same every year from the middle of winter to the middle of summer or about. Then it dries up completely. This brought to Rev. Father Principal to believe that if the well could be cleaned thoroughly and put in good order, we would not have, my dear Mr. Luthersland, to worry you with this question.\nYou will notice also that finding his case desperate,\nRev. L. Levern tried himself to dig a well. I did not\napprove this move; but I understand that one can\ncome to such determination as that, when for months\nthey are menaced by a scarcity of water extreme-\nly dangerous. It is so that about the middle of\nJanuary this year fire started in the sewer on\naccount of the accumulation of gas which is not\nregularly washed away. We were afraid at\na certain moment that the whole school would burn.\nI hope that this question will finally be settled\nto the best advantage of the interested persons, and\nin the meantime, I pray you to believe in my\nbest sentiments.\n\n(Signed) U. Langlois\n\nO. M. D.\nOttawa, February 8, 1934.\n\nDear Father Langlois:\n\nI have your letter of the 3rd instant, with further reference to the water supply at the Sacred Heart Indian Residential School, on the Peigan reserve, and enclosing a communication which you received from the Rev. Principal, regarding the matter.\n\nUpon receipt of your former letter, dated December 21st, last, the Department requested Mr. Inspector Christianson to investigate the water conditions at this school and submit a report. He was to consult the representative of the Dominion Water Power Branch at Calgary. Mr. Christianson replied stating he has arranged that Mr. Wattley, of the Water Power Branch, would accompany him to Bracken to look into the situation as soon as weather conditions permit. Mr. Christianson stated that it would depend on the weather when they would visit the school and examine into conditions.\n\nIt is hoped, in the meantime, that the school will have sufficient water, as this winter there has been a great deal of snow and several Chinooks in the southern part of the province, which have melted the snow. Of course, when you take into consideration that the school has approximately 100\n\n- head of\n\nVery Rev. U. Langlois, O.M.I.,\nOblate Fathers' Prov. House,\n9916 - 110th St.,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nhead of live stock and that this number of cattle require a great deal of water, there is some possibility of the school being short of water. As soon as the Department receives the report and recommendations of the officer of the Dominion Water Power Branch, the question of providing more water at this school will receive consideration.\n\nI am returning herewith the letters which you forwarded from the Principal of the School, as you may require same for your file.\n\nWith kindest regards,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.

Indian School, Brocket, Alberta,\n\nby P.A. Fetterly, Asst. Hydraulic Engineer.\n\n1. Purpose of Report\n\nInstructions were received by Mr. M. Christianson, Inspector of Indian Agencies, from the Department of Indian Affairs, to proceed to Sacred Heart Indian School, Brocket, Alberta, to ascertain the reason for complaints received from Father Levern to the effect that the water supply at the school was inadequate.\n\nHe was also instructed to request a representative of the Dominion Water Power Bureau to accompany him. It stated that the sum of $2750, or thereabouts had been expended in 1932 for an improved water supply and, in view of this, to obtain all available data on the matter.\n\nThe writer, who was responsible for the design and construction of the works in connection with the\ndevelopment and consequent augmentation of the water supply accompanied Mr. Christiansson on an inspection trip on January 23 and 24.\n\n2. Review of Past Activities\n\nThe preliminary report was made on May 26, 1931. This report describes in detail conditions as they existed at that time.\n\n(a) School Requirements\n\nThe requirements of the school were 3050 gallons per day, with an available supply from the original well of 550 gallons, together with 400 gallons from the undeveloped spring. This latter supply flowed from the spring to a dammed pond, a great deal of water being lost by seepage and evaporation, and more through pollution by livestock.\n\n(b) The Original Well\n\nThe original well was drilled under the engine room to a depth of 300 feet, Mr. Gardner-Smith being in charge for the Department of Indian Affairs. It then yielded an adequate supply for all purposes and continued to do so for a time. It at last began to fail but the reason could not be ascertained although various attempts were made.\n\nCertain men connected with the\nschool who were present when the well was drilled claimed (on January 23) that the well became crooked at 250 feet because the strata of stone were at an angle and that the driller withdrew his tools at 300 feet. The driller, Ben Sill, of Macleod, Alberta, who was interviewed on the same date, stated definitely that the well was straight to the bottom. Mr. Gardner-Smith has lately corroborated this statement.\n\nHowever, for some reason which has not been definitely ascertained, the production lessened to 550 gallons per day. The yield of the well has been fluctuating from that amount upwards since that time. In the dry season, say from May to October, the yield is at a minimum. It then gradually increases during the winter.\n\nIn the semi-arid regions the general efficiency of wells is very difficult, in fact almost impossible to foretell. There may be surface springs of small or average flow in the vicinity, but this is no criterion of conditions 300 or 400 feet down.\n\n(c) Driller Sill's Statement\n\nMr. Sill, who was out of the country\nwhen the original report was made in 1931, and so could not be interviewed, stated on January 23, 1934, that he went through hard sand and clay to 133 feet. He obtained some water at 80 feet but not enough. This volume increased as he went down. The hardness of the sand structure also increased. He stopped drilling in hard sand at 300 feet with an adequate supply of water. He then cased the well with 5-5/8\" casing to 133 feet and with 5\" casing to 300 feet. The last 20 feet of casing was well perforated with holes. He claims the well was not crooked, and that it was a good well. He plugged the well as the pump was not lowered for some time after he finished drilling. Incidentally this matter of waiting to put in the pump for some time after the hole is finished is objected to by some drillers as the well has a chance to fill up with sand, e.g., Blue Quills School well trouble.\n\nMr. Sill states now that if he were drilling another well he would drill deeper.\n\nSumming up, the probable trouble is caused by a seasonal fluctuating supply in the underground reservoir. The water may not seep sufficiently fast into the well to produce an adequate supply. Or the holes may\nplug up with sand. Conditions may be caused by one or more of several reasons which are almost impossible to ascertain in a well 300 feet deep.\n\n(d) The Spring.\n\nThe spring produced 12 to 1600 gallons per day in 1926, when the school was constructed. In 1931 it produced 400 gallons per day, as measured by the writer.\n\nIt was determined, in a final report before construction, dated September 11, 1932, after considering three alternatives, i.e., drilling a new well near the old one, drilling a new well on the plateau 3000 feet south of the school, or developing the spring; to carry out the latter plan. This plan was the one suggested by Mr. Christianson before the writer mentioned it and without his (the writer's) knowledge until January 23. It was, and still is, considered the best plan, the success of a new well near the site of the old one being problematical, and a well on the hill being considered entirely too expensive because of the trenching, together with the construction of a well house, engine and pump, etc., on the site which would be difficult of access. The spring would produce a sure supply of good water, even if it did fluctuate in volume.\nHowever, the spring was excavated in order to intercept underground water and to act as a reservoir, a concrete tank and engine being installed. A trench was excavated to the School 900 feet to the west. The total cost was $2750.\n\nThe point should be emphasized that no change in the opinion of Mr. Christianson or the writer has taken place as regards the best plan to use in 1932, viz: development of a sure and visible supply, i.e., the spring.\n\nThe first trial development increased the flow of the spring to 1700 gallons per day. It was therefore considered that the best plan was to develop the spring.\n\nFather Lavern stated in a letter to this office, dated June 4, 1932, as follows: \"I am glad to say that the new water supply system at our school is giving perfect satisfaction. The plant is working very well\". This was written several months before the supply began to fail, the spring of 1933.\n\n3. Present Situation\n\nThe writer interviewed the school authorities on January 23, 1934. They stated that it was very unfortunate that the inspection was made at that date. They stated that if the school had been visited between May and December it would have been found that the supply was entirely inadequate. The cattle were all sent to the\nriver bottom, 6 miles north of the school, for the summer. Even then the supply was inadequate.\n\nIt appears that the supply in the well and spring diminished substantially in May and only began to increase about January 1, Christmas day, and many other days, were occupied melting snow to provide a sufficient supply for the school.\n\n**Present Requirements**\n\nThe approximate amount now required is as follows:\n\n- 70 persons at 30 gallons = 2100 gallons.\n- 65 head of cattle at 12 gallons = 780 \"\n- 14 horses at 12 gallons = 168 \"\n- 8 pigs = 16 \"\n\nTotal requirements are therefore about 3064 gallons, which is substantially the same as those of 1932.\n\n**Information Received from School Authorities and by Observation**\n\nIn the spring of 1933, the water in both well and spring diminished, until Nov. 15, then began to rise. It rose late in December. The tank pressure sometimes rose to 15 lbs. but usually 10 lbs., normal pressure being 40 lbs. for two tanks of 700 gallons each.\n\nBefore pumping for the cattle there was enough for the house. Last fall there was not sufficient for house alone. In the summer the well was very low most of\nthe time. It furnished a little water but could not be depended upon.\n\nAs a rule the water was pumped from the spring for about one hour per day producing 500 or 600 gallons.\n\nOn January 23 the well was producing a fair amount.\n\nThe School Engineer stated that \"4 tanks full\" was sufficient for all purposes. This would amount to about the 3000 gallons estimated.\n\nThe School attempted last autumn to drill a well 200 feet east of the school, in the paddock, with a borrowed rig. They drilled 100 feet but found a dry hole. They then removed the rig to a small coulee about 2000 feet south of the School near the plateau and drilled 40 feet but were stopped by storm. This was done before Christmas. Water will evidently not be found in shallow wells in the vicinity of the School.\n\nThe school authorities state that the driller claimed at the time of drilling that the well produced 16 or 1700 gallons per day. This was corroborated by Mr. Gardner-Smith, Brotherson of Calgary, who tested the well about 1929 or 1930 claimed that it produced only 700 gallons per day. One can understand the difficulty of obtaining correct facts.\n\nIn an attempted test of conditions at the spring the writer on January 23, 1934, pumped upwards of 1000 gallons from the spring into the tanks. At the end\nof three hours water was still coming freely. The school engineer stated that at first he pumped each day until the pump \"sucked\" but that now he pumps for a stated time only in order to obtain a reserve. Consequently, a supply has accumulated in the concrete tank at the spring which has a capacity of nearly 6000 gallons. This experiment was for the purpose of ascertaining the present probable production of the spring. This is very difficult to obtain but it is probably considerably in excess of the minimum of 400 gallons during the winter.\n\nThe total production of the well and spring during minimum flow in summer and autumn is therefore from 12 to 1400 gallons while the present flow - since Christmas - is from 2000 to 2500 gallons. This increased flow will last until April or May. It will then diminish to the minimum, as before.\n\n4. Conclusions\n\n(a) Although ideas differ, the balance of opinion appears to favour locating wells in the open instead of under the main building.\n\n(b) The writer still believes that development of the spring provided the best remedy in 1932 for shortage of water.\n\n(c) A well on the plateau 2 or 3000 feet south of the school would have possibly provided a remedy as well drillers state that water is\nmore often found on a hill than at the foot, although by no means invariably. They only say that there is a \"better chance\". In this case this would have been entirely too expensive. It would also have been very inconvenient because of the distance of the machinery from the house.\n\n(d) The present well does not provide sufficient water. This, together with the spring provides sufficient water during part of the year, but not sufficient during the dry season.\n\n(e) In this geographical situation water is very difficult to obtain under any circumstances, and every available source must be used. The engineer responsible for the supply, therefore, has to overcome a very difficult situation through no fault of his own, but because of physical conditions in a semi-arid area where no surface supply is available except for the spring.\n\n(f) As each individual source is deficient by itself, with no known means of improvement, use of both the present well and the spring should be continued, and the product of another source should be added to the supply.\n\n5. Recommendation\n\nSince conditions necessitate further\naugmentation of the supply, there is no doubt of this fact, considering the necessities of the school itself, together with the large amount of stock to be supplied, entirely by artificial means - there is no other solution in the opinion of the writer, than to provide another supply. The two present sources of supply should be continued.\n\nIn view of this, one can see no other solution than to drill another well to a minimum depth of 300 feet, just outside the building and a few feet to the east or south, whichever is the most convenient.\n\nThe question of the new well being so near the old one was considered, and no reason could be adduced against locating the well five or six feet away regardless of the reason for the partial failure of the old one.\n\nThis new well should be sufficiently close to the present well so that a walking beam arrangement would connect the present pumping jack to the rods in the new well, for transfer of power from one well to the other when necessary.\n\nIf the well were located at a distance the cost of construction would increase greatly.\n\nFacts learned by Mr. Sill in drilling the other well would be invaluable in drilling a new one. He drilled the old one with his own small rig. He now is an employee of T. Maughan of Lethbridge who has a large rig.\nat present lying unused 8 miles south of Pincher Creek and about 25 miles from the School. It was recently used in cleaning the well at school on the Blood Reserve. Incidentally, Mr. Sill charges $100 for renovating an old well and $1.50 per foot for drilling a new one.\n\nOne question which cannot be definitely answered is \"What is wrong with the old well?\" The supply may fluctuate or the well may be inefficient. If the former then augmentation is necessary. If the latter than a new well is a necessity. It is also suggested that a last examination be made of the old well at a cost of $100 before starting the new one while the drilling rig is at the school.\n\n6. Estimates.\n\nThe cost of a new well is as follows:\n\n- Drilling 300 feet @ $1.50 = $450.00\n- Casing 300 feet @ $1.11 = $333.00\n- Piping P.& R. 300 feet @ 74.54 = $223.62\n- Working Barrel 2-3/4\" = $23.50\n- Octagonal Rods 1-3/8\" 300' @ 41\u00a2 = $123.00\n- Walking Beam Connections = $75.00\n- Pipe Connections = $20.00\n- Alterations in walls of present building = $30.00\n- Examination of old well = $100.00\n\nTotal = $1378.12\nAddendum re Walking Beam\n\nSince the above was written the general design of the means of transferring power from the pump jack, which is being left in its present position over the old well, to the new well has been the object of further study.\n\nIn the first place, the writer does not know any duplicate of this idea of pumping from two wells by means of one jack and thus needs to proceed carefully. No detailed plans are being drafted as it would appear to be the work of a more experienced mechanical expert to design contact points of rods and walking beam, also the pivot in the wall. A 5\" I beam should carry the necessary weight of approximately 1300 pounds, (doubled because of sudden strain?) and requiring between one and two horse power.\n\nSecondly, the walking beam might work more efficiently if it were sufficiently long so that the inner end were directly over the centre of the old well so it could be connected to the centre plunger of the jack. If the new well were placed at an equal distance outside the well the total length of beam would be about 6\u00bd feet. This would eliminate unequal strain on the shaft as would be the case if the rod were joined to the large cog wheel of the jack next the wall.\n\nThe upright rod, of course would move\nthrough a small arc, with a displacement of possibly 1/2\" from the vertical. This might be the cause of difficulty in designing.\n\nThirdly, there appears to be no reason for doubting the possibility of activating both pumps simultaneously. In this way the weight of columns of water, etc., would be partially equalized and the delivery of water increased. The apparatus, of course, should be designed so that each could work independently.\n\nLastly, instead of using the walking beam the possibility of lengthening the overhead shaft to a point, say 3 feet outside of the building, has been considered. The concrete basement wall would then be cut through and an extra alcove made directly south of the pump jack. The building itself would need to be extended to cover the shaft. The present pulley shaft near the roof, however, is not very strong and might not stand the extra strain.\n\nP.A. Fetterly\n\nAsst. Hydraulic Engineer.\n\nO.H. Hoover,\n\nEngineer-in-Charge.\n\nCalgary, Alberta, February 6, 1934.\nSir,\n\nEnclosed herewith is a report dated the 6th instant by Mr. P.A. Fetterly of our Calgary staff dealing with the present condition of the water supply system at the Sacred Heart Indian school near Brocket, Alberta.\n\nThis report was prepared at the request of Mr. Christianson, Inspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nThe report shows that there has been a serious falling off in the water supply available for the school due to partial failure of the deep well and of the spring which was cleaned out and enlarged in 1932.\n\nIt is recommended that the existing deep well be examined by a competent driller to find out if sand or other obstructions are preventing a full flow of water, and if the former flow cannot be obtained, to drill a new well 300 feet deep near the present one as shown on the plan attached to the report. The cost of examining the present well is estimated at $100 and of drilling a new well at $1278.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nPer\n\nA. F. MacKenzie Esq.\nSecretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nFile 4919.\n\nCalgary, Alta., Feb. 6, 1934.\n\nReport\n\non\n\nCondition of Water Supply\n\nat\n\nSacred Heart (R.C.) Indian School,\n\nBrocket, Alberta,\n\nby\n\nP.A. Betterly,\nAsst. Hydraulic Engineer.\n\n1. Purpose of Report\n\nInstructions were received by Mr. M. Christiansen, Inspector of Indian Agencies, from the Department of Indian Affairs, to proceed to Sacred Heart Indian School, Brocket, Alberta, to ascertain the reason for complaints received from Father Lavern to the effect that the water supply at the school was inadequate.\n\nHe was also instructed to request a representative of the Dominion Water Power Bureau to accompany him. It stated that the sum of $2750, or theremabouts had been expended in 1932 for an improved water supply and, in view of this, to obtain all available data on the matter.\n\nThe writer, who was responsible for the design and construction of the works in connection with the\ndevelopment and consequent augmentation of the water supply accompanied Mr. Christianson on an inspection trip on January 23 and 24.\n\n2. Review of Past Activities\n\nThe preliminary report was made on May 26, 1931. This report describes in detail conditions as they existed at that time.\n\n(a) School Requirements\n\nThe requirements of the school were 3050 gallons per day, with an available supply from the original well of 550 gallons, together with 400 gallons from the undeveloped spring. This latter supply flowed from the spring to a dammed pond, a great deal of water being lost by seepage and evaporation, and more through pollution by livestock.\n\n(b) The Original Well\n\nThe original well was drilled under the engine room to a depth of 300 feet. Mr. Gardner-Smith being in charge for the Department of Indian Affairs. It then yielded an adequate supply for all purposes and continued to do so for a time. It at last began to fail but the reason could not be ascertained although various attempts were made.\n\nCertain men connected with the\nschool who were present when the well was drilled claimed (on January 23) that the well became crooked at 250 feet because the strata of stone were at an angle and that the driller withdrew his tools at 300 feet. The driller, Ben Sill, of Macleod, Alberta, who was interviewed on the same date, stated definitely that the well was straight to the bottom. Mr. Gardner-Smith has lately corroborated this statement.\n\nHowever, for some reason which has not been definitely ascertained, the production lessened to 550 gallons per day. The yield of the well has been fluctuating from that amount upwards since that time. In the dry season, say from May to October, the yield is at a minimum. It then gradually increases during the winter.\n\nIn the semi-arid regions the general efficiency of wells is very difficult, in fact almost impossible to foretell. There may be surface springs of small or average flow in the vicinity, but this is no criterion of conditions 300 or 400 feet down.\n\n(c) Driller Sill's Statement\n\nMr. Sill, who was out of the country\nwhen the original report was made in 1931, and so could not be interviewed, stated on January 23, 1954, that he went through hard sand and clay to 133 feet. He obtained some water at 80 feet but not enough. This volume increased as he went down. The hardness of the sand structure also increased. He stopped drilling in hard sand at 300 feet with an adequate supply of water. He then cased the well with 5-9/16\" casing to 133 feet and with 5\" casing to 300 feet. The last 20 feet of casing was well perforated with holes. He claims the well was not crooked, and that it was a good well. He plugged the well as the pump was not lowered for some time after he finished drilling. Incidentally this matter of waiting to put in the pump for some time after the hole is finished is objected to by some drillers as the well has a chance to fill up with sand, e.g., Blue Quills School well trouble.\n\nMr. Sill states now that if he were drilling another well he would drill deeper.\n\nSumming up, the probable trouble is caused by a seasonal fluctuating supply in the underground reservoir. The water may not seep sufficiently fast into the well to produce an adequate supply. Or the holes may\nplug up with sand. Conditions may be caused by one or more of several reasons which are almost impossible to ascertain in a well 300 feet deep.\n\n(d) The Spring.\n\nThe spring produced 12 to 1600 gallons per day in 1926, when the school was constructed. In 1931 it produced 400 gallons per day, as measured by the writer.\n\nIt was determined, in a final report before construction, dated September 11, 1932, after considering three alternatives, i.e., drilling a new well near the old one, drilling a new well on the plateau 3000 feet south of the school, or developing the spring; to carry out the latter plan. This plan was the one suggested by Mr. Christianson before the writer mentioned it and without his (the writer's) knowledge until January 23. It was, and still is, considered the best plan, the success of a new well near the site of the old one being problematical, and a well on the hill being considered entirely too expensive because of the trenching, together with the construction of a well house, engine and pump, etc., on the site which would be difficult of access. The spring would produce a sure supply of good water, even if it did fluctuate in volume.\nHowever, the spring was excavated in order to intercept underground water and to act as a reservoir; a concrete tank and engine being installed. A trench was excavated to the School 900 feet to the west. The total cost was $2750.\n\nThe point should be emphasized that no change in the opinion of Mr. Christianson or the writer has taken place as regards the best plan to use in 1932, viz: development of a sure and visible supply, i.e., the spring.\n\nThe first trial development increased the flow of the spring to 1700 gallons per day. It was therefore considered that the best plan was to develop the spring.\n\nFather Lavergne stated in a letter to this office, dated June 4, 1932, as follows: \"I am glad to say that the new water supply system at our school is giving perfect satisfaction. The plant is working very well\". This was written several months before the supply began to fail, the spring of 1933.\n\n3. Present Situation\n\nThe writer interviewed the school authorities on January 23, 1934. They stated that it was very unfortunate that the inspection was made at that date. They stated that if the school had been visited between May and December it would have been found that the supply was entirely inadequate. The cattle were all sent to the\nriver bottom, 6 miles north of the school, for the summer. Even then the supply was inadequate.\n\nIt appears that the supply in the well and spring diminished substantially in May and only began to increase about January 1, Christmas day, and many other days, were occupied melting snow to provide a sufficient supply for the school.\n\n**Present Requirements**\n\nThe approximate amount now required is as follows:\n\n- 70 persons at 30 gallons = 2100 gallons\n- 65 head of cattle at 12 gallons = 780 \"\n- 14 horses at 12 gallons = 168 \"\n- 8 pigs = 16 \"\n\nTotal requirements are therefore about 3100 gallons, which is substantially the same as those of 1932.\n\n**Information Received from School Authorities and by Observation**\n\nIn the spring of 1933, the water in both well and spring diminished, until Nov. 15, then began to rise. It rose late in December. The tank pressure sometimes rose to 15 lbs., but usually 10 lbs. Normal pressure being 40 lbs. for two tanks of 700 gallons each.\n\nBefore pumping for the cattle there was enough for the house. Last fall there was not sufficient for house alone. In the summer the well was very low most of\nthe time. It furnished a little water but could not be depended upon.\n\nAs a rule the water was pumped from the spring for about one hour per day producing 500 or 600 gallons.\n\nOn January 23 the well was producing a fair amount.\n\nThe School Engineer stated that \"4 tanks full\" was sufficient for all purposes. This would amount to about the 3000 gallons estimated.\n\nThe School attempted last autumn to drill a well 200 feet east of the school, in the paddock, with a borrowed rig. They drilled 100 feet but found a dry hole. They then removed the rig to a small coulee about 2000 feet south of the School near the plateau and drilled 40 feet but were stopped by storm. This was done before Christmas. Water will evidently not be found in shallow wells in the vicinity of the School.\n\nThe school authorities state that the driller claimed at the time of drilling that the well produced 16 or 1700 gallons per day. This was corroborated by Mr. Gardner-Smith, Brotherson of Calgary, who tested the well about 1929 or 1930 claimed that it produced only 700 gallons per day. One can understand the difficulty of obtaining correct facts.\n\nIn an attempted test of conditions at the spring the writer on January 23, 1936, pumped upwards of 1000 gallons from the spring into the tanks. At the end\nof three hours water was still coming freely. The school engineer stated that at first he pumped each day until the pump \"sucked\" but that now he pumps for a stated time only in order to obtain a reserve. Consequently, a supply has accumulated in the concrete tank at the spring which has a capacity of nearly 6000 gallons. This experiment was for the purpose of ascertaining the present probable production of the spring. This is very difficult to obtain but it is probably considerably in excess of the minimum of 400 gallons during the winter.\n\nThe total production of the well and spring during minimum flow in summer and autumn is therefore from 12 to 1400 gallons while the present flow - since Christmas - is from 2000 to 2500 gallons. This increased flow will last until April or May. It will then diminish to the minimum, as before.\n\n4. Conclusions\n\n(a) Although ideas differ, the balance of opinion appears to favour locating wells in the open instead of under the main building.\n\n(b) The writer still believes that development of the spring provided the best remedy in 1932 for shortage of water.\n\n(c) A well on the plateau 2 or 3000 feet south of the school would have possibly provided a remedy as well drillers state that water is\nmore often found on a hill than at the foot, although by no means invariably. They only say that there is a \"better chance\". In this case this would have been entirely too expensive. It would also have been very inconvenient because of the distance of the machinery from the house.\n\n(d) The present well does not provide sufficient water. This, together with the spring provides sufficient water during part of the year, but not sufficient during the dry season.\n\n(d) In this geographical situation water is very difficult to obtain under any circumstances, and every available source must be used. The engineer responsible for the supply, therefore, has to overcome a very difficult situation through no fault of his own, but because of physical conditions in a semi-arid area where no surface supply is available except for the spring.\n\n(f) As each individual source is deficient by itself, with no known means of improvement, use of both the present well and the spring should be continued, and the product of another source should be added to the supply.\n\n5. Recommendation\n\nSince conditions necessitate further\naugmentation of the supply, there is no doubt of this fact, considering the necessities of the School itself, together with the large amount of stock to be supplied, entirely by artificial means - there is no other solution in the opinion of the writer, than to provide another supply. The two present sources of supply should be continued.\n\nIn view of this, one can see no other solution than to drill another well to a minimum depth of 300 feet, just outside the building and a few feet to the east or south, whichever is the most convenient.\n\nThe question of the new well being so near the old one was considered, and no reason could be adduced against locating the well five or six feet away regardless of the reason for the partial failure of the old one.\n\nThis new well should be sufficiently close to the present well so that a walking beam arrangement would connect the present pumping jack to the rods in the new well, for transfer of power from one well to the other when necessary.\n\nIf the well were located at a distance the cost of construction would increase greatly.\n\nFacts learned by Mr. Gill in drilling the other well would be invaluable in drilling a new one. He drilled the old one with his own small rig. He now is an employee of T. Maughan of Lethbridge who has a large rig.\nat present lying unused 8 miles south of Fincher Creek and about 25 miles from the School. It was recently used in cleaning the well at school on the Blood Reserve. Incidentally, Mr. Sill charges $100 for renovating an old well and $1.50 per foot for drilling a new one.\n\nOne question which cannot be definitely answered is \"what is wrong with the old well?\" The supply may fluctuate or the well may be inefficient. If the former then augmentation is necessary. If the latter than a new well is a necessity. It is also suggested that a last examination be made of the old well at a cost of $100 before starting the new one while the drilling rig is at the school.\n\n6. Estimates.\n\nThe cost of a new well is as follows:\n\n| Item                        | Cost   |\n|-----------------------------|--------|\n| Drilling 300 feet @ $1.50   | $450.00|\n| Casing 300 feet @ $1.11     | 333.00 |\n| Piping P & R. 300 feet @ 74.54 | 223.62 |\n| Working Barrel 2-3/4\"       | 23.50  |\n| Octagonal Rods 1-3/8\" 300' @ 41\u00a2 | 123.00 |\n| Walking Beam Connections    | 75.00  |\n| Pipe Connections            | 20.00  |\n| Alterations in walls of present building | 30.00 |\n| Examination of old well     | 100.00 |\n\nTotal: $1378.12\nAddendum re Walking Beam\n\nSince the above was written the general design of the means of transferring power from the pump jack, which is being left in its present position over the old well, to the new well has been the object of further study.\n\nIn the first place, the writer does not know any duplicate of this idea of pumping from two wells by means of one jack and thus needs to proceed carefully. No detailed plans are being drafted as it would appear to be the work of a more experienced mechanical expert to design contact points of rods and walking beam, also the pivot in the wall. A 5\" I beam should carry the necessary weight of approximately 1300 pounds, (doubled because of sudden strain?) and requiring between one and two horse power.\n\nSecondly, the walking beam might work more efficiently if it were sufficiently long so that the inner end were directly over the centre of the old well so it could be connected to the centre plunger of the jack. If the new well were placed at an equal distance outside the well the total length of beam would be about 6\u00bd feet. This would eliminate unequal strain on the shaft as would be the case if the rod were joined to the large cog wheel of the jack next the wall.\n\nThe upright rod, of course would move\nthrough a small arc, with a displacement of possibly 1/2\" from the vertical. This might be the cause of difficulty in designing.\n\nThirdly, there appears to be no reason for doubting the possibility of activating both pumps simultaneously. In this way the weight of columns of water, etc., would be partially equalized and the delivery of water increased. The apparatus, of course, should be designed so that each could work independently.\n\nLastly, instead of using the walking beam the possibility of lengthening the overhead shaft to a point, say 3 feet outside of the building, has been considered. The concrete basement wall would then be cut through and an extra alcove made directly south of the pump jack. The building itself would need to be extended to cover the shaft. The present pulley shaft near the roof, however, is not very strong and might not stand the extra strain.\n\nP.A. Fetterly\n\nAsst. Hydraulic Engineer.\n\nO.M. Hoover,\nEngineer-in-Charge.\n\nCalgary, Alberta, February 6, 1934.\nSir:\n\nI beg to refer you to Department's letter No. 116-2-5 of the 2nd ultimo and my reply thereto dated the 9th ultimo, in connection with the water supply at the Sacred Heart Indian Residential School on the Peigan Reserve. I now have to report that on January 23rd I left for the Peigan Reserve in company with Mr. P. A. Fetterly, Assistant Hydraulic Engineer of the Dominion Water Power Bureau here. His report on the water situation was forwarded to his Department at Ottawa and our Department has probably been furnished with a copy of this, but in case you have not received this I am forwarding an extra copy of the report which I have on hand; also a copy of the blueprint. Mr. Fetterly handed me this report just as I was leaving for the Peace River country and this is the first opportunity I have had of going over it. I might say that Mr. Fetterly has discussed the matter thoroughly with me and he has made a very detailed report on the situation, so I have nothing to add to his remarks, which cover every phase of the situation.\n\nI would now suggest that Mr. Fetterly's recommendation which appears on Page 12 of his report, be followed out: Viz.,\u2014that an examination be made of the old well at a cost of $100 before starting a new one; as I know there was sufficient water in the present well at one time, as shortly after it was completed I was there and had the well tested. There is a possibility that the source from which the water comes in the bottom of the well is clogged up with sand. Of course it would have to be understood,...\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nO T T A W A.\nstood that if sufficient water could not be found in the old well authority for a new well should be given at the same time so that the well drillers would not have to move their outfit away from the premises. This should be gone on with as soon as possible while the outfit is in that vicinity, as you will note that Mr. Fetterly mentioned that it is now located about 25 miles from the school. I would also suggest that we secure the services of Mr. Fetterly at the school while the old well is being examined.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.

Mr. Maughan owns practically all of the drilling rigs in the general vicinity. Mr. Ben Sills was an employee of his but has been incapacitated for some time with an injured hand. However, Joe Maughan is an experienced driller.\n\nMr. Maughan phoned today that he has only now been able to ascertain conditions regarding his rig. The rig is now engaged at a well 18 miles south west of Brocket and it would be very difficult to pull tools and move 18 miles and then back, and do a good job before March 31.

Mr. Maughan stated that his brother, Mr. Joe Maughan, together with Mr. Fetterly, visited in former letters, the original driller of the well, visited the site about April 1st. They found that the cost of transporting the rig, which would have to be dismantled for shipment, would cost the most of the $100 appropriated for the whole work. This excessive cost is caused by the present state of the roads, as the frost is now coming out.\n\nTransportation would have been comparatively easy when the roads were frozen but they will now be impassable for a time.\n\nHowever, these men inspected the well and thought it possible that the reservoir around the bottom of the hole has been partially demudded of water and now fills again only slowly. If this be the case a new well would need to be located further away than at first supposed. This matter will have to be decided later. Meanwhile, they thought that the best plan to follow at present was the attempted cleaning of the old well.\n\nI might say that I have lately heard that an attempt was made several years ago to pull the inside pipe. It dropped from a height and injured the cylinder but was afterwards removed and repaired. They may have also tamped the sand if any were present in the casing. However, these matters should be cleared up when the well is examined.\n\nI now consider, more than ever, that the\n\nThe Director,\nWater Power & Hydrometric Bureau,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOttawa.\ndevelopment of the spring was a fortunate move.\n\nI would therefore recommend that the appropriation of $100 be renewed, the work to be done when transportation of the rig is possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nEngineer-In-Charge.\n(Signature)\n\nS. PEARSON\n\nPlumbing, Steam and Hot Water Heating.\n\nPincher Creek., Alta. April, IIth, 1934.\n\nMr. Webb,\nActing Indian Agent.\nBrocket., Alta.\n\nDear Sir;-\n\nI beg to submit the cost for the repairing of the septic tank at the Sacred Heart School.\n\nThe size of the tank is twenty two feet by eight feet. There is about three feet six inches of earth on the top of the tank. I will remove this, and construct a ten inch reinforced concrete cover on the tank, with a cast iron man-hole in each compartment. The gravel will be clean, and the mixture will be six parts of gravel to one of cement, with five eighth rods a foot apart, and hog wire over the whole top of the tank.\n\nI can supply all of the material and labour for this work, which I assure you will be done as specified, for the consideration of One Hundred and Eighty two dollars.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSigned.... Stanley Pearson.\nSir,\n\nWith reference to the Septic Tank installed at the Sacred Heart Indian Residential School, at the time of the erection of the school, there has been continuous trouble in connection with the sewage system.\n\nYesterday, the Principal (Rev. J. L. Lever) called in, and at his request I went out to the school. Mr. Pearson (the plumber) was there, and he showed me very plainly how the septic tank had not been operating since it was installed. The valves had been plugged with concrete, presumably at the time it was installed, accidentally, also the overflow pipes were each covered with a brick; the covering of the septic tank was with two layers of wooden planks, these partly owing to the tank inefficiently operating, had become rotted.\n\nMr. Pearson suggests (as per his letter attached) to remove the dirt on the top, take off the old planking and put a good permanent top of re-inforced concrete in place of the wood. I would strongly recommend this course, not only as a lasting repair, but also on account of this tank being located in the playground, where at any time in the near future, the top would cave in with disastrous results to a child being on the spot.\n\nMay I be favoured with an early reply please.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

Victor Webb,\nClerk in Charge.\nApril 17, 1934.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 11th with reference to the septic tank at the Sacred Heart Indian Residential School I beg to say that it is not considered necessary to install a reinforced concrete top to the septic tank. Planks properly protected should meet the requirements. If any of the planks have rotted they may be renewed.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nT. W.

J. L. Levern, O.M.I., that the Department will allow a grant at the rate of $40 a month to enable him to employ a night watchman from November 1, 1934, to March 31, 1935.

Lancaster, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBrocket, Alta.\nSir,\n\nWith reference to the Lighting Plants at The Sacred Heart Indian Residential School and The St Cyprian's (Anglican) Indian Residential School, I beg to request the Department to issue authority to have the batteries replaced with new ones, at an approximate cost of $1,000.00.\n\nThe present ones were placed in operation in November, 1931 in both schools, now they are worn out, being sulphated so badly that the sediment is up to the plates in places, and they will not hold the charge. Winter is approaching, with the inevitable heavy drain on the batteries, and the new ones should be installed as soon as possible, may I be favoured with an early reply.\n\nI may add the present present batteries were supplied by Geo. Scougall (Macleod) for the St. Cyprian's School, these being \"Globelite\", and at the Sacred Heart School, Mr. Brotherston (Calgary) rebuilt the old ones with new elements.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. W. Victor Webb,\nClerk in Charge.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nOctober 1st, 1934.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General,\n\nNew batteries are required for the lighting plants at the Sacred Heart (R.C.) and the St. Cyprian (Anglican) Indian Residential Schools, on the Pelican Reserve, No. 147, Electoral District of Macleod, Alberta.\n\nThe present batteries at both schools were supplied in November, 1931, and they are now worn out. The batteries at the Sacred Heart School were supplied by the Brotherston Electric Company, Limited, Calgary, and the ones at the St. Cyprian School, by George H. Scougall, Macleod, Alberta.\n\nThe cost of the batteries for each school will be, approximately, $600.00. Funds for the purpose are available in the Appropriation for the current fiscal year.\n\nI would be pleased to be advised of the names of the firms with whom the orders are to be placed.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nOctober 3, 1934.\n\nDear Mr. Christianson:\n\nA request has been received, through the office of Mr. Lancaster, Indian Agent, Brocket, to have the batteries replaced at each of the Sacred Heart and St. Cyprian Indian Residential Schools. The batteries at present in use at each of these schools have been in operation since November, 1931. The cost of supplying new batteries will be, approximately, $500.00 for each school.\n\nIt has occurred to me that it might be possible to have these schools connected up with the lines of the Calgary Power Company and thus obtain light and power, obviating the necessity of renewing batteries for the lighting plants from time to time.\n\nI would request that you report as to the advisability of supplying these schools with light and power and installing the necessary power line from the Calgary Power Company plant to the schools. You should state the distance it would be necessary to extend the power line to each school and the approximate cost. I shall be pleased to have as complete information as possible in this connection.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nMr. Christianson, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nInspector's Office,\nCalgary, Alta.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nINSPECTOR'S OFFICE\nPB CALGARY, ALTA., October 10th, 1934.\n\nDear Doctor McGill:\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 116-2-5 of the 3rd instant in connection with the request of the Sacred Heart and St. Cyprian Indian Residential Schools on the Peigan Reserve, to be supplied with new batteries for their lighting plants. Immediately upon receipt of your letter I got in touch with the Calgary Power Company and they are going to give me an approximate price in a few days as to the cost of connecting the schools up with the power line. I asked them, at the same time, to give a price on connecting up with the Agency, as the power line is straight North of the Agency and the St. Cyprian School is practically straight off the Agency, so the power line would have to pass the Agency. This, of course, will be a separate item and need not be gone into at the present time.\n\nJust as soon as I receive the necessary information from the Calgary Power Company it will be forwarded to you for consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDr. H.

Pincher Creek, Alta.\n\nGeorge Buskard\nPrivate Secretary.\nOttawa, November 2, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to refer to your 406-11 of the 10th ultimo, in which you stated you were obtaining from the Calgary Power Company an estimate of the cost of connecting the Sacred Heart and St. Cyprian Indian Residential Schools, on the Peigan reserve, with their power lines. As you have been informed, both these schools have requested new batteries for their electric light system. The Department is anxious to come to a decision as to whether it would be cheaper in the long run to continue present lighting arrangements and supply the new batteries or provide the cost of connecting these schools with the Calgary Power Company's lines. I should be pleased, therefore, to have the estimate of the cost of making the connection with the Power Company's lines, for each school, as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

Christiansen, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nInspector's Office,\nCalgary, Alta.\nOttawa, November 8, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of the voucher which you forwarded, in favour of Stanley Pearson, for repairs which he made to the bake oven at the Sacred Heart Indian Residential School.\n\nThe Treasury Department have referred this voucher back to this Department for further information concerning the repairs and the labour. Please obtain from Stanley Pearson an account, stating in full detail the repairs carried out to the bake oven and particulars regarding the labour and the rate paid. I am returning the voucher which you submitted and would request that you forward another, in triplicate, with the accounts attached, giving the information requested.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Cristienson\nInspector\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n507 Calgary Public Bldg.\nCalgary, Alta.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nA short time ago you made some inquiries regarding the cost of supplying the Agency and the two schools at Brocket with electric service. As mentioned to you at that time, these prospective loads are very small and widely scattered, each requiring several miles of expensive 13,000 volt line to reach them.\n\nWe approached the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. with regard to electrification of their pump at Brocket in order to try and obtain some additional revenue from this point but we are advised that the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. is unwilling to consider any change at the present time.\n\nIn order to extend our transmission line and install a distribution system for the Agency buildings at Brocket, we would have to be guaranteed a yearly revenue of $1,025.00 in order for us to break even on the fixed charges on the line itself, plus energy, maintenance and replacement costs.\n\nThe extension to the St. Cyprian Anglican School requires a further extension of approximately 3-3/4 miles and we would expect a guaranteed revenue of $950.00 per year from this school.\n\nThe Roman Catholic School is located approximately 4 miles beyond the Anglican School and the guaranteed yearly revenue from this point would have to be $1,000.00.\nMr. M. Christianson  \nDept. of Indian Affairs  \nCalgary, Alta.  \n\nNovember 3rd, 1934\n\nWe are doubtful if you will be interested in electrification at the cost mentioned above but if you are, we will be very glad to further discuss the question with you.\n\nYours truly,\n\nCALGARY POWER COMPANY LIMITED.\n\nHBL/MM  \nOperating Superintendent.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nINSPECTOR'S OFFICE\nPB CALGARY, ALTA., November 7th, 1934.\n\nDear Doctor McGill:\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 116-2-5 of the 3rd ultimo, in connection with connecting Sacred Heart and St. Cyprian Indian Residential Schools on the Peigan Reserve with the Calgary Power Company's high power line which runs across the reserve. I immediately took this matter up with the Calgary Power Company and have just received their reply. I am attaching hereto their letter, which speaks for itself. The reason I included the Agency in the Estimates was that the power line that would run to St. Cyprian School would have to pass near the Agency. You will note that the Department would have to guarantee a revenue of $1000.00 from each school, and the same from the Agency, practically $3000.00 in all, and I think this project is out of the question.\n\nShould the Department contemplate purchasing batteries for the two schools, I would strongly recommend the ironclad battery handled by the Bruce Robinson Electric Company. The cost would be approximately $700.00 for each school, and the batteries carry a 7-year guarantee.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDoctor Harold W. McGill,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nM. Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\nOttawa, November 14, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI have been directed to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 7th instant, enclosing a communication from the Calgary Power Company, Limited, with reference to the cost of supplying the Sacred Heart and St. Cyprian Indian Residential Schools and the agency on the Peigan reserve with electric service.\n\nIn reply I have to say that, owing to the cost involved, it is considered that this project is out of the question, and we are therefore not prepared to proceed further in the matter.\n\nAs you were informed, it will be necessary to have the batteries replaced at the Sacred Heart and the St. Cyprian Schools, and I would request that you arrange for the purchase of same. You should obtain prices for the supplying of the batteries, of the type required at each school, from the following firms:\n\nGeorge H. Scougall, Macleod, Alta.\nPincher Creek Motors, Pincher Creek, Alta.\n\nPurchase should be made from the firm quoting the lowest price. After the batteries have been delivered, you should obtain an account, in triplicate, covering the cost for each school, separately. These accounts, you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nM.

Indian Residential School in the Peigan Agency. Conditions at this institution are very good. This is one of our best schools. I found there were 50 children on the register and 48 in attendance.\n\nBUILDINGS & EQUIPMENT:\n\nI went over the buildings, equipment, machinery, etc. The outside buildings are all in a first class state of repair. I found that some new buildings had been put up by the Principal: A lean-to shed had been built to the barn with a roof to protect cattle during storms. They had also built a stable out of logs and a shed East of the other buildings where the calves are being taken care of.\n\nThe machinery all seemed to be in Al shape and giving satisfaction. The same can be said about the boiler and Lister Bruston engine at this institution as at St. Cyprian's; The engineer in charge of the plant and boiler\n\nDoctor Harold W. McGill,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nBUILDINGS &C. (Continued).\u2014\n\nis one Omer Dubois, who acts also as Farming Instructor. He is not a first class engineer by any means but keeps the plant well oiled and greased, &c., and does not tamper with it, and so far he has had very little trouble. I would recommend that this engine also be overhauled by an expert next summer. I think this would save money in the long run, and would give the engineer an opportunity of learning more about the engine.\n\nThe school building is in good condition except for wear and tear. Some of the walls need painting and quite a bit of plaster has come loose and is falling off the walls in the basement. The Sister Superior brought to my attention that if the Department would supply some paint, oil, &c., in the spring, they would do a lot of inside decorating during the summer holidays. My opinion is that a certain amount of paint should be supplied every year so as to enable the Staff to keep the buildings in good shape. I shall submit a list of the school's requirements to the Department. The outside buildings required painting very badly as well, but as I have said in other reports to the Department, we will have to get along without it until such time as funds are available.\n\nThe Principal informed me that the roof of the school was leaking last spring and they had done something to remedy this, but did not know whether it was effective as they had had no rain since. I presume that in a short time the roofs on both these schools will be gone over as\nBuildings, etc., (Continued),\u2014\n\nwith the terrific winds that prevail there a roof requires constant repairing.\n\nA few years ago a refrigeration plant was built at the school on the same plan as that built at St. Paul's School on the Blood Reserve by Mr. Weston. Father Levern informs me that his plant has never been satisfactory, whereas the one at St. Paul's School has always given perfect satisfaction. I would like to have the Department give me authority to have Mr. Weston look over this plant sometime. This would not be expensive as I am sure Mr. Pugh would drive him up to the school.\n\nThe Department will recall that we had a lot of trouble about the water at this institution last year; I took Mr. Fetterly of the Dominion Water Power Branch down to the school, and while there he went into the matter thoroughly and recommended that the well be cleaned out. This work was done with good results and the school now have ample water in the well; also in the spring which was developed some few years ago.\n\nFARMING:\u2014\n\nThe live stock at this school consists of 13 horses, 57 head of cattle of which 35 are cows and at the time of my inspection they were milking 14; 40 pigs, 110 chickens, some geese and turkeys. The school threshed 2430 bushels of wheat and 1260 bushels of oats and 348 bushels of barley. They own their own threshing outfit and the tractor is also used on the farm. A certain amount of the work on the farm is done by the boys. The school harvested 10 tons of potatoes and all other garden\nFarming (Continued):\n\ntruck in large quantities; more than enough to take care of their requirements. During the last year 2000 pounds of butter were made and this all goes to the staff and children, so the children have butter on the table every day.\n\nThe grounds around this institution are in excellent shape: I only hope you have an opportunity of seeing them sometime in the summer time. This is one of the best examples I know of as to what can be done on the bald-headed prairie, even in Southern Alberta. They have the most beautiful grounds you could wish to see: Trees, hedges and shrubs all around the place.\n\nTRAINING:\n\nThe children here receive a very good training in household science and outside work, which fits them very well for their life on the reserve after they graduate from school.\n\nI learned from the Principal that no fire drill was carried on at this school and the reason for this was that there was a night-watchman on duty. I instructed him that even with a night-watchman there a fire drill should be held periodically.\n\nHEALTH:\n\nThe same can be said about the children of this school as of St. Cyprian's; that I have never seen them looking any better. They certainly present a happy and well-cared-for appearance. I checked over the clothing and found that each child has several changes and is warmly clad.\nGENERAL:\n\nAs a whole I have always found this school very satisfactory. Father Levern is an exceptionally good manager and a good provider and is running a good farm and producing ample food stuff from the garden and cattle to feed both children and staff well at a minimum of cost, and this is an achievement especially in that part of the country.\n\nThe Staff consists of 10 Sisters of Charity, the Principal, 1 lay-brother, one farming instructor who also acts as engineer, and an extra man is hired during the summer.\n\nThis school also has a number of children of school age out on the reserve who are not attending school, and the same remarks regarding recruiting as I made in the case of St. Cyprian's School, apply here.\n\nI trust this report will be of interest to you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nINSPECTOR'S OFFICE\nPB CALGARY, ALTA., December 15th, 1934.\n\nDear Doctor McGill:\n\nI have the honour to report on an inspection of the Sacred Heart R.

The Estimates are now before Treasury Board, and I am not in a position to state at the present time whether the amount requested for painting and repairs at these schools will be allowed. I would suggest that you draw this matter to the attention of the Department next spring, giving an estimate of the cost, separately, of the painting - exterior and interior - of these schools and also any minor repairs that may be required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

I was fairly sure that this was the trouble there. Mr. Weston states that he is prepared to go up to the school with his own car and helper and put the plant in first class order for $45.00, and there will probably be about $10.00 worth of lumber required as well.\n\nI would ask that this expenditure be authorized as the plant as it is is of no use.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.

Agent\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nINSPECTOR'S OFFICE\nPB CALGARY, ALTA., March 1st, 1935.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have to bring to your attention my letter No. 406-11A.R.C. of the 28th of January, last, in connection with voucher rendered by Mr. Geo. H. Scougall of Macleod for batteries furnished to the Sacred Heart School: If you look up my letter you will see that I asked you to examine the voucher and forward it through this office. Instead of that it was sent direct to the Department. The voucher in question was for $502.25 whereas the Pincher Creek Motors supplied the batteries to St. Cyprian's School for $447.50. The reason the voucher was forwarded to you was to avoid delay, as I had to take the matter up with the representative of the Fairbanks Morse here, and he was absent from the city at that time. If this difference had not been noticed by the Department we would have been called upon to pay about $55.00 extra to Mr. Scougall.\n\nYou will please change the amount of your copy of the former voucher and same in your voucher book, from $502.25 to $447.50, as the corrected voucher is now going forward to the Department. In future be very careful as to whether the voucher is to go through this office or to the Department, direct.\n\nH. C. Lancaster, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBROCKET, Alta.\n\nYours truly,\n\nM. Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 116-2-5 of the 13th ult., in connection with batteries supplied to the 2 Indian Residential Schools on the Peigan Reserve, and I note the Pincher Creek Motors' voucher in the amount of $447.50 has been paid, but that Mr. Scougall's voucher is being held. In this regard I wish to state that I had great difficulty in getting prices from the 2 above-mentioned firms, as they do not handle batteries, and to get a satisfactory quotation on something about which they knew very little, was not easy. As there were only the two names on the list submitted to me, I was anxious to divide the business between them, and therefore both had to give the same price. I learned that both firms were dealing with Fairbanks Morse Company in the city here, and a representative of that firm came to see me, and it was arranged with him that the net price of the batteries to us in each case would be $447.50. The voucher from Pincher Creek Motors was forwarded to the Department as received; but it was noted that when Mr. Scougall sent in his account it was for $502.28. I called up the Fairbanks Morse here and found that their battery man was out of the city at the time, and awaiting his return, I forwarded the voucher to the Peigan Agency asking them to prepare same and return it to this office, so that I could make the correction on it when the matter was adjusted. I was surprised to learn that Mr. Lancaster had sent the voucher to the Department direct, and I am attaching hereto copy of a letter I have addressed to him in this connection.\n\nI am now enclosing herewith another voucher from Mr. Scougall for the correct amount of $447.50, and I would recommend it for immediate payment, as these people are making a very small profit on the batteries. I wish to point out that the batteries purchased for the schools 3 years ago were only 7-plate, whereas those installed now are the very best 13-plate Globelites, which are far superior to the previous batteries, and I sincerely hope they will last a year or two longer than the old ones.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nM.

To do this work properly, it is necessary to have a man from the Lister-Bruston Company at Edmonton. It only means spending extra money to have him call and examine the machine, and consequently, I have authorized Mr. Christianson to arrange to have him go to the school and make the necessary repairs, as these are stated to be necessary. There is money in the appropriation for painting at this school, but this matter can stand until you receive the account for fixing the engine, and if there is any money left then, the painting could be authorized.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nJune 15, 1935.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe: SACRED HEART RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nI visited this School on the 4th inst. with Mr. Christianson and Mr. Lancaster. I understand that paint to the amount of $110.60 has already been allowed, and, in addition, I authorized material for the radiators at a cost of $60.00, 600 ft. of \"V\" flooring, and some shelving for the girls' dormitory; 4 screen doors, and a small quantity of varnish.\n\nThe Principal requested 6 yds. of 27\" heavy oilcloth for the kitchen table. This will be purchased by Mr. Christianson. I would recommend that a new sewing machine be supplied to this School.\n\nAs you are aware, this is a frame building, and the fire escape on the west side is falling away from the building.

Lancaster, Indian Agent,\nBrocket, Alta.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your conversation in regard to the repairing of the tar and gravel roof at the Sacred Heart School. It is hard for me to give you a correct estimate on this work until I get the old gravel cleaned off, and examine the condition of the roof.\n\nBut I think the only thing to do is to strip this portion of the roof and relay with tar paper and gravel. I can then guarantee that this portion of the roof will not leak. I would imagine that the material would cost in the neighborhood of Twenty eight dollars, and the labor Twenty six dollars.\n\nHoping to hear from you in the near future with regard to this work, I remain\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nPeigan Agency, Brocket, Alta.\n\nJuly 23rd, 1935.\n\nSir,\n\nWe have been having considerable trouble with the sky-lights over the engine rooms looking at the two schools, and when Mr. Phelan was here he authorized me to have them repaired and the glass in the dome has been repaired but a recent heavy rain caused the roof at the base of the sky-light cupola to leak badly and this seems to be the source of the trouble and I enclose Mr. Pearson's estimate of the cost of repairing the roof at the R.C. school at around $54.00.\n\nIt is possible the sky-light at the C of R school will have to be treated in the same manner.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.C. Lancaster,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, July 31, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd instant, regarding the repairs required to the skylights over the engine rooms at the Sacred Heart Indian Residential School and enclosing an estimate of the cost of carrying out the repairs.\n\nIn this connection I have to say the Department will approve of an expenditure of approximately $55.00 in having this work done. I enclose an encumbrance certificate, authorizing an expenditure to that amount. You should see that a satisfactory job is completed, and, when finished to your satisfaction, you should forward vouchers, in triplicate, stating in detail the work done. Please state, on each copy of your voucher, that the expenditure was incurred under authority of E. R. No. 3659.\n\nThe Department notes it is possible that the skylight at the St. Cyprian Residential School will require similar repairs. If this work is absolutely necessary, the Department would like to have a report from you, with an estimate of the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nEncl.\n\nH. C.

It is noted that the cost will be approximately $15.00 for each bowl. I shall be pleased if you will arrange to have the purchase made before the end of the present month; and the account covering the cost should be dated before that time. It should reach the Department not later than the middle of April, next, in order that payment can be made from our Appropriation for the current fiscal year, before our books are closed. It is understood that the school staff will install the bowls, without cost to the Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nH. C. Lancaster, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBrockst, Alta.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nINSPECTOR'S OFFICE\nPB CALGARY, ALTA., March 27th, 1936.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to bring to your attention my report addressed to Dr. McGill, on Sacred Heart Indian Residential School, R. C., on the Peigan Reserve.\n\nIn going over the school I found that the pressure boilers in the basement had both been placed on end on a cement floor, on a level about 2 inches lower than the rest of the basement floor. Some water always drips around the tanks, and owing to the fact that they are lower than the rest of the floor, there is no way for the water to run away and it simply stays there and gradually evaporates. By that time probably a little more water has dripped in, so there is always dampness around the tanks. The only way this could be drained would be to cut a hole in the concrete and put a pipe from the lower level where the tanks are situated, attaching it to one of the drain pipes in the sub-basement where the boiler is. The sooner this is done the better, because the tanks are beginning to show signs of rust from the dampness. Father Levern said the lay brother who was there would do this work if we furnished the material, and this should not cost more than $10.00 or $15.00. I would recommend authorization of this.\n\nThere is also the matter of paint for the interior of the school: For the last three years we have supplied the sisters with a certain amount of paint each year, which has certainly been put to good use, and they informed me that if the Department would supply what they asked for in the Estimates, this would be put on during the summer holidays. They also asked for linoleum for the 2 infirmaries, which rooms are 14' x 13'. This is a matter for the Department to decide, but I would strongly recommend that the paint be supplied, as it is costing us nothing for labour.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nM. Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\nOttawa, April 1st, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 27th ultimo, you may expend an amount of approximately $15.00 in the purchase of the material required for a drain in the basement of the Sacred Heart Indian Residential School.\n\nPlease let me know the approximate cost of the paint that you consider should be supplied, also the cost of the linoleum for the infirmary.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nT.

When on the reserve on the 5th instant I visited the school, and was informed that the supply of water was inadequate; so much so that snow had to be melted during the winter to supplement the limited supply from the well and spring.\n\nThe present source of water supply, (well and spring), having been previously explained to the Department by both Mr. Inspector Christianson and Mr. F. A. Fetterly of the Dominion Water Power Bureau, Calgary, I do not consider it necessary that I do so again.\n\nAs it is, water must be spared for cooking and washing. Bath tubs are not used, there is no fire protection, and worst of all, toilets can only be flushed occasionally. This creates a great danger of the sewer pipes blocking, through lack of sufficient water pressure passing through same.\n\nIt is imperative that action be taken at once to relieve the situation. My suggestion would be that a new well be sunk outside the building and that the Dominion Water Power Bureau be asked to take charge of the work, as this will require underground connection with the pressure tanks; also a building will be required to cover the new well, &c.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC.

F. Schmidt, Inspector of Indian Agencies, Calgary, Alta., that the well at the Sacred Heart Indian Residential School on the Peigan Reserve is again giving trouble.\n\nIn the Spring of 1934, Mr. Fetterley thoroughly investigated the water situation at this school and, at that time, advised the cleaning of the well. This was done at a very reasonable cost and, since that time, there has been very little trouble with the water supply.\n\nI would appreciate if you would instruct Mr. Fetterley to visit the Sacred Heart Indian Residential School at the earliest possible date and investigate and report on water conditions. It is possible that, if the well was again cleaned out, there would be no further trouble for some time and, in this event, Mr. Fetterley may proceed at once with the necessary work. If, however, he considers a new well is necessary, we will have to have full particulars, with an estimate of the cost.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. T.

An agreement was made with Mr. Joe Maughan of Lethbridge to perform the work. This was done during the week beginning April 23 and finished April 27. The cost, as agreed upon was $100.00.\n\nThe well was cleaned out and new leathers installed in the cylinder.\n\nMr. W.T. McFarlane inspected the completed work on May 2, owing to the absence of Mr. Fetterly in the north. He obtained the following information:\n\n- Depth of well: 300 feet.\n- Height of water before baling: 160 \"\n- The water dropped 10 ft. after 10 to 15 minutes baling, then remained steady. Both parties decided that further baling was not necessary.\n- Amount bailed out: 260 gallons.\n- Inside diameter of well casing: 5-5/8 inches.\n- Very little dirt was found when cleaning out the well.\n- Diameter of pump pipe: 3-1/2\"\n- Total length of pump pipe: 260 feet.\n- Diameter of working barrel: 2-3/4\"\n- Length of cylinder: 30 inches.\n\nMr. Maughan believed that the pump would be efficient. The present well was drilled in 1928 and has gone dry every summer except the first one.\n\nIf another well were dug the location suggested would be near the barn where the stock could use it. There is no reason why it would not go dry when most needed.\"\n\nOn May 3 we received a letter from Rev. Father J.L. Lavern, Principal, reporting as follows:\n\n\"Just a few lines to tell you that Mr. Maughan has finished his work yesterday evening; before six o'clock we were pumping the well. Everything is all right for the present time. We have all of the water that we need, - right now - but God knows how it may be again in July or August.\"\nIt will be noted that Father Lavern is not sure of a permanent cure. Consequently the school is again to be congratulated on possessing a permanent visible supply - though small - in the spring development.\n\nMr. Joe Maughan the driller, has been requested to provide an invoice in quadruplicate for his services.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP.A. Fetterly\n\n(signed) P.A. Fetterly.\nOttawa, June 16, 1937.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Wardle,\n\nI am enclosing herewith a copy of a report by Mr. P. A. Fetterly of the Calgary Office of the Dominion Water and Power Bureau entitled \"Preliminary Report on Water Situation at Sacred Heart Indian Residential School, Oldman River, Alberta.\" This report was prepared in accordance with instructions sent the Controller of the Dominion Water and Power Bureau under Indian Affairs Board. Letter dated March 24th last, their file I/62/10. As you are aware, since the date of the above letter, arrangements were made by which the Engineering and Construction Service is now responsible for work of this nature, and under the circumstances this matter was referred to us by the Dominion Water and Power Bureau.\n\nIn the letter of instructions Mr. Fetterly was requested to visit the Sacred Heart School and report on water conditions. If he considered it feasible he was authorized to have the well reformed to its attached report cleaned out; but if he considered a new well was necessary, he was to supply full particulars with an estimate of cost.\n\nIt will be noted from the report that in 1934 the well was cleaned out, but the improvement in flow only lasted a few weeks. Furthermore it is stated that since the well was first drawn up in 1928 it has never yielded the supply expected or hoped from it. It is understood that a minimum supply of 5,000 gallons per day is required at the School. Under the circumstances, simply cleaning out the well once more would not appear to meet the situation.\n\nMr. Fetterly has considered means of amplifying the present supply during drought periods and first concludes that much of the water in the well is a local \"ground spring,\" depending on heavy rainfalls. In the fall and winter months the well is dry, and the School is dependent on a spring whose maximum observed output is reported at 1,700 gallons per day. The two suggestions put forward in the report as remedies are:\n\n(a) Drilling of a new well.\n(b) Removal of the School to a site near the Oldman River.\n\nIn considering (a) it is pointed out that if the hypothesis regarding the supply of water to the existing well is correct there would be little use sinking a new well near it. The cost of a new well is estimated at $2,500.00. The cost of a well drilled apart from the school requiring pump house, piping, etc., is estimated at $2,000.00 or more. Even then the purpose of the new well might not be served as the water might not be there.\n\nIn regard to suggestion (b) Mr. Fetterly has given no estimate of cost of moving the buildings and plant.\n\nJ. M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nto the proposed new location. This would appear the most desirable solution from an engineering viewpoint but would, of course, be altogether dependent on the policy to be followed as to local school requirements.\n\nIn connection with the foregoing, I would point out, aside from all other requirements, the necessity of having a reliable and sufficient water supply as a fire protection, which under the present circumstances is not provided.\n\nIn view of the situation as set forth in the attached report which is the only information we have concerning this matter, there would appear to be no suitable alternative to the suggestion (b) above, removal of the school site near the Oldman River. Under the circumstances this action is recommended. This recommendation would of course be subject to any decision made in this connection by the Indian Affairs Branch under their local school policy or regulations.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nT.S. Mills\nPreliminary Report on Water Situation at Sacred Heart Indian Residential School Brockett.\n\nby P.A. Fetterly, B.Sc., Asst. Hydraulic Engineer.\n\n1. Purpose of Report.\n\nA letter was received from the Controller dated March 27, 1937, containing instructions to investigate the water situation at the above-named School. Pursuant to these instructions the writer visited the school on May 12, having been unable to do so before that date due to pressure of routine work, and also due to the fact that Mr. Schmidt, Inspector of Indian Agencies for Alberta, had also requested to make the trip in an unofficial capacity to ascertain conditions. The inspection was therefore delayed until he was free. Due, however, to the fact that Mr. Schmidt was compelled to be in the north for a further two weeks, it was decided that the inspection be made without further delay, and in his absence.\n\n2. Observations.\n\n(a) Preliminary Consideration.\n\nThe whole matter will be discussed in this\nreport as it presents itself to the writer at the present time and for preliminary consideration.\n\nAt present the school has sufficient water to supply its necessities. This condition, as will hereinafter be shown, will continue until August, especially since the school will require still less water during July and August due to depleted population. Consequently future actions need not be hurried particularly because of the seriousness of the general situation.\n\n(b) Past History\n\nThe first complaint regarding water supply was received in 1931, three years after construction of the school. It was then decided to provide a sure and visible supply of water, although an admittedly small one, by developing a spring nine hundred feet southeast of the school. This was completed in May 1932 and acted as auxiliary to the well under the boiler room of the school which was originally intended to provide all of the necessities of the school. The spring has done all that was expected of it.\n\nAs outlined in the enclosed copy of a report dated May 4, 1934, the well has never performed its full duty since it was constructed. Of course it provided sufficient water for construction of the building but the provision of 5000 gallons per day for years to come was another matter.\n\nThe final report on development of the spring dated June 1, 1932, describes all conditions as on that date, as does also one dated February 6, 1934, in which a new well at a cost of $1378.12 is considered.\nThe next development was receipt of a letter dated March 12, 1934, from the Director, requesting another inspection of the well. It was then decided to clean the well. This operation was completed on May 3, 1934.\n\nIt is to be understood that since the well was first drilled, in 1928, it has never yielded the supply expected or hoped from it. The last improvement, in 1934, only lasted a few weeks.\n\nA new complaint dated March 27, 1937, has now been received from the Controller concerning the well, containing a suggestion that the well be again cleaned if considered feasible, before considering the construction of a new well.\n\n(c) Present Condition of Well & Spring.\n\nFor the past three years, practically ever since the well was cleaned in 1934, the school has had an entirely inadequate supply of water. As will be noted from the report dated May 4, 1934, very little dirt was removed at the last cleaning. Consequently the renovation did not seem to be of much use in increasing the flow. Evidence presented in this present report corroborates this opinion.\n\nDuring the last few years the spring and well both increase their flow each year about May first, in fact to a sufficient amount to supply the school. This continues until August in varying degrees. For instance, almost exactly four days after a heavy thaw or a heavy rain both well and spring increase in flow to quite an appreciable extent. This last condition lasts for a short while until both sources again lower in yield but not to an insufficient amount. In August the flow definitely lowers to an absolutely ridiculous amount considering the necessities of the school.\n(d) Particulars as to use of water by the School.\n\nTo capitulate, sufficient water is available from May to August, when the necessities are least. In August the supply diminishes almost to the vanishing point. During the past winter from September to April, for instance, the stock, which has been reduced from nearly 100 head to 30 head for this very reason, were watered once per week. During the remainder of each week they ate snow. During the day on which the stock was watered the school had no supply whatever.\n\nIt naturally follows that if the well fails, no water is available for both stock and school together as the spring will not supply both. Incidentally it might be mentioned that the spring on the average supplies possibly 1000 to 1200 gallons per day. The wants of the whole school would be 5000 gallons per day or more.\n\nAgain, on wash day, no water is available for anything else whatever. From September to April the children are bathed less than once per month. The clothes are successively washed in the same water until it becomes too filthy to be used. No water is available for flushing the toilets except at impossible intervals. An explosion occurred in the septic tank a short time ago due to the accumulation of gas, the contents being in a solid form instead of liquid. This tank is about 60 feet from the school. The gas took fire probably by electric spark and the flame leapt 15 feet into the air, bringing all of the Indians within sight to the school, thinking it was on fire.\n\nDuring this season no water is available in case of fire, i.e., for the most important and largest portion of the year. The two pumps are activating most of the\nday pumping air and a little water, not because of inefficiency but because the water is not in the well or spring in sufficient quantities. Father Riaux states that he is spending $50 to $100 per month for water, mostly because he has to pump so much air.\n\nBefore April the spring supplies sufficient water for the school proper. The stock obtains water from the small dammed pond below the spring. When the lake goes dry in the fall the spring cannot supply all, until the thaw in the spring. It will be noted that nothing is mentioned regarding the well. This, however, quite in August and resumes a small flow about April 20. There are no sloughs or lakes in this general area.\n\nThere is a real danger of typhoid epidemic as the toilets are so infrequently flushed and the children are bathed and their clothes washed so seldom. The explosion in the septic tank is significant external evidence of conditions.\n\nThe Principal stated that, in order to protect himself, he would be compelled to call in the Minister of Health of the Alberta Government who would likely take steps to close the school until conditions are remedied. It is apparent that action such as this would be disastrous.\n\n3. Obvious Remedies.\n\nThe writer hesitates to approach this matter in the way which he feels it should be, and is satisfied that it must, ultimately, be considered. However, he feels that some one must take the responsibility of at least introducing the subject of the only final remedy. Before discussing this drastic solution the matter of cleaning or duplicating the present well will be considered. As\nsufficient water is being produced for ordinary purposes at present, and as vacation time is approaching, when the wants as regards water will be lessened, plenty of time is available for a full consideration of the problem. It must be remembered that the writer has to obtain some of the evidence from other, but reliable persons. The writer does not didactically state that the ultimate remedy proposed is the only one, but places it in this report as a basis on which to begin, after giving all of the facts in his possession together with his deductions and ideas.\n\n(a) Clean out present well.\n\nThe well was \"cleaned out\" in 1934 but as far as could be ascertained practically no foreign matter was removed in the process. No other change was made in the apparatus of the well. In the long run no change occurred in production except for a short time after cleaning. It is now very similar in activity as before cleaning. The letter from the Controller dated March 27, 1937, authorizes the writer to clean it again without further reference to Ottawa.\n\nEven this privilege the writer hesitates to use until this report has been considered, as he wonders if it will do any good. If the water is not there, no amount of cleaning will produce it. The evidence points to the fact that when water appears in the well (which is 300 feet deep) the pump puts it into the tanks. A shallower or deeper vein might be found but this requires experimenting. However, as before mentioned, 4 days after a thaw or a\nheavy rain there is plenty of water in the well and everything is favourable. This gradually decreases for a few days until it reaches a very low ebb indeed, which condition continues until the next rain. The source of the well water must be in a surface soil far enough away that 4 days are occupied in finding its way to the well and spring.\n\nIt would appear that the paucity of rain of the last six or seven years has depleted the ground water to such an extent that the well is of no use. The supply in the river itself may have some effect. Further evidence would indicate that it (the well) never fulfilled its destined purpose.\n\n(b) Rehabilitate the Spring.\n\nThe spring appears to be affected by drought similarly to the well. It was already known before development by experiment that it varied in yield. The writer obtained as high as 1700 gallons per day in trials. It has been shown since that the yield from September to April lessens considerably. There is no method of increasing this yield by further development. Consequently no change can be made in the spring. There were 6 feet of water in the spring at the time of the writer's visit.\n\n(c) Drilling of a new well.\n\nIf the conclusions regarding depletion of ground water be correct there would appear to be no improvement in the drilling of a new well near the old one. The most economical location would be within a few feet of the old one and just outside the machinery room in order that the machinery could be housed in an extension of the machine-room most convenient for economical construction, access, heating, delivery of water, etc. But, if the above hypotheses be correct as regards depletion of ground water and present\nefficiency of the present deep well pumping plant in itself one cannot see the use of sinking a new well near it. Of course, a new well could be sunk to a deeper vein if one were existent.\n\nIt has been stated that a \"water-witch\" lives at Pincher Creek 15 miles west of Brockett who has offered to locate a well for $100. No doubt he or any one else could locate water in this area but of unknown depth or volume. One of the Sisters of the institution is said to be able to locate the crossing of two veins up hill and 300 or 400 feet southeast and uphill from the spring, (which is 900 feet east by south of the school) by oscillation of a watch hung on its chain. If this be so one stream is probably that which feeds the spring. The other vein lies north-east and south-west. However, if present its volume and depth is unknown.\n\nThis all might be quite true since it is known that water lies under this area but the question is \"just how much experimenting should be done in seeking a well with permanent adequate supply?\" A new well, if drilled, apart from the school, would need a pump house, separate deep well pump, casing, rods, heating apparatus, and a 9' trench to the school for a pipe line unless the mechanical portion of the present plant is used. The total cost would depend on the length of pipe line and might total $2000 or more, (an accurate estimate is not needed at this stage). Even then the purpose of the new well might not be served, as the water might not be there in sufficient quantities. At present one would not know just where to drill a well to be sure of success.\nIn a word, it would be real experimenting to sink a new well, and the writer is quite ready to either spend $100 or so on cleaning the present well or to go ahead and drill a new one.\n\nThis present report is an endeavour to place all facts and probabilities before the Indian authorities for consideration, as, under present circumstances, there is no immediate hurry for a decision. Incidentally they will have on file blue prints and photographs sent with the original report dated May 26, 1931.\n\n4. Possible Permanent Remedy\n\nA permanent solution of the difficulties is now about to be discussed. At this stage the writer will not propose it because of its radical nature, but will consider all sides and angles of the proposal.\n\n(a) Location of Present School\n\nThe school is located on the side of a ridge on a small plateau 100 feet or so below the top. It is 15 miles west of Macleod and 5 or 6 miles south of the Oldman river. It lies 3 miles south of the Crows Nest Trail to B.C. The estimated elevation above the river bed is about 300 feet. (The bottom of the present well would therefore be about the level of the river bed. This is only an estimate by eye observation).\n\n(b) Conditions\n\nThe Peigan Reserve had a population of 300 Indians at the time the school was built, in 1928. It has now a population of 500 and is increasing at the rate of 25 per year.\n\nThe school has a present population of 56. There are 50 children on the reserve unprovided for. A total of\n125 children need school facilities.\n\nThe building is of frame construction. Veneering was intended, it is understood, but was never done. In the high winds prevalent in this locality the building vibrates sufficiently to move the water in the basins.\n\nThe school has to be self-contained owing to its isolation and distance from the highway.\n\nThe wind destroys the crops. A field was sown to 200 lbs. clover seed this spring and is now all blown out and will have to be reseeded. The other fields are in the same condition.\n\nThe lighting and power system will have to be renewed at an early date as it is rapidly deteriorating but, of course, the insecurity of the water situation is the most difficult to deal with.\n\nPower lines are located along the highway three miles to the north.\n\nThe present building is said to be very cold in winter.\n\nSome of the facts noted above are from personal observation. Others are \"second-hand\".\n\n(c) Proposals.\n\nIn short, the proposal set forth for discussion is to move the buildings to the river. The main building could be torn down and rebuilt at the river, cheaply.\n\nThe water shortage would then be permanently solved and the authorities would have better facilities for power, farming, access to roads, etc.\n\nSeveral good sites are available as noted by the writer in a superficial examination on May 18.\n\nThe writer is perfectly aware of the possible\ncomplications in this kind of proposal when considering the fact that another Church has a school at Brockett. This school is said to have about 45 Indian children. This situation may have the effect of invalidating the whole proposal.\n\nThe principal stated that he did not see how he could carry on under present conditions as to water supply.\n\n5. Conclusion.\n\nThe writer, as stated before, is ready to clean the well, or drill a new one. In case of the latter, the location would be a matter of opinion.\n\nThe radical proposal contained in Par.4(c) is another matter altogether and is set forth in great hesitancy.\n\nOf course, a series of wet years might change the situation entirely, although the behaviour of the well since 1928 does not give much encouragement to this hope.\n\nAlthough the statement was made before in this report that there is no necessity for haste at present still, it would be best not to delay consideration too long as, if a new well is decided upon, it should be ready before September. The cleaning of the present well is a very simple matter and would occupy a few days only.\n\nBecause of the importance of the question it has been dealt with in considerable detail perhaps unnecessarily so in order that the authorities may be able to understand the writer's ideas on the subject. He does not pretend to think he has said the last word on the subject. His personal\nopinion, however, is that under present conditions there will always be trouble as regards the water situation.\n\nProspecting for a shallow well for a farm house is one matter, usually easily solved; but looking for the location for a deep well to serve an institution like this, is another matter entirely. Experimental costs run high because of the nature of the plant itself including housing, mechanical portion, 9' trench, etc.; and one hesitates before embarking on it. Water, like gold, is where you find it, and looking for it in sufficient quantities under present conditions is still more difficult.\n\nThe reactions of the officials of the Indian Department towards this report will be awaited with interest.\n\nP.A. Fetterly,\nAsst. Hydraulic Engineer.\n\nO.H. Hoover,\nEngineer-In-Charge.\n\nCalgary, Alberta, May 26, 1937.\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. T.R.L. MacInnes,\nActing Director, Indian Affairs.\n\nI am enclosing herewith a memorandum submitted by Mr. Mills, Chief Engineer of our Engineering and Construction Service, with which he encloses a report from Mr. P.A. Fetterly covering the water supply situation at the Sacred Heart Indian Residential School, Brocket, Alberta.\n\nYou will note from the reports that the water supply from the existing well is inadequate and will always be so under normal precipitation conditions. The alternatives are either sinking a deep well at an estimated cost of some $1,378 and which might be greatly exceeded before a satisfactory water supply was secured, or moving the school to a location near the river. The adoption of the latter proposal, and which would afford a permanent solution from the water supply viewpoint, is of course one of policy. If the Indian Affairs Branch wish to seriously consider this alternative, we will obtain for you an estimate of cost of moving the school.\n\nWill you kindly let me have your reactions to Mr. Fetterly's report.\n\nDirector.\nJune 29, 1937.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Hoey,\n\nRegarding the Sacred Heart School on the Peigan Indian Reserve I have read Mr. Fetterly's report regarding the trouble they are experiencing in getting water. I have also read the memoranda from Mr. Wardle and Mr. Mills.\n\nIn the first place I wish to point out that when this school was built there was ample water in the well, which the report of Mr. E. Gardiner Smith, who was the building inspector at the time, will show, copy of which report is on file here. I know that a real test was made of the well before the building was erected. The first head of any water obtained at this school was in 1930\u2014at that time they were drawing the pipes out of the well to put in a new cylinder. When the pipes were raised to about one length from the bottom the chain broke and the pipes went down to the bottom with quite a force as you will readily understand as they were about 300 feet in length. Since that time the well has not been functioning properly. Whether this has anything to do with the shortage of water or not I am not in a position to say, I only wish to draw your attention to this point.\n\nWhat I would now suggest is this. There is an Indian living just a short distance west of the school by the name of Neil Yellow Wings. He has a well at his place, also a spring in which I know at times there is plenty of water. I would suggest that Mr. Fetterly be requested to examine the well there and also the possibilities in regard to the spring. This would give us an idea as to the amount of water in the vicinity and it might be possible to put in a reservoir at Neil Yellow Wings' spring and water the cattle and horses belonging to the school there, which would be quite a factor as only a short time ago the school had about 100 head of cattle and horses using the water from the well and spring at the school. By cleaning the well at the school and with the dam at the spring there might be sufficient water for the use of the school.\n\nI would also suggest having Mr. Fetterly question Father Lavergne regarding a spring higher up in the hill above the school. There was one there at one time but of course it may have dried up. Father Lavergne, as you know, was Principal of the Sacred Heart School for quite a number of years, but is now at St. Mary's School on the Blood Reserve.\nThe drilling of another well at the school should be considered in the event of all other plans failing, as to my mind the moving of the school to the river is absolutely out of the question.\n\nThe present school is a three storey building with a basement, of frame construction, lathed and plastered, with a flat roof. There is also a large barn at the school, with a hip roof, concrete foundation and floor, built of frame construction. There are also other buildings too numerous to mention such as chicken coops, implement shed, shop, etc. The cost of taking these buildings down and hauling the material to the river and rebuilding would be enormous.\n\n[Signature]\n\nGeneral Superintendent of Agencies.\nOttawa, July 2, 1937.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. J. M. Wardle,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources.\n\nI have, for acknowledgment, your memorandum of June 21st and also report submitted to you by Mr. Mills, Chief Engineer of your Engineering and Construction Service, and from Mr. P. A. Fetterly, Assistant Hydraulic Engineer covering the water supply situation at the Sacred Heart Indian Residential School, Brocket, Alberta.\n\nI may state, by way of comment, that these reports have been submitted to Mr. Christiansen, General Superintendent of Agencies, for his consideration. Mr. Christiansen was, until a few weeks ago, Inspector of Indian Agencies for the Province of Alberta and is familiar with conditions at the Sacred Heart School. Mr. Christiansen, in his reply, states:\n\n\"The first I heard of any water shortage at the Sacred Heart School was in 1930. At that time they were drawing the pipes out of the well to put in a new cylinder. When the pipes were raised to about one length from the bottom, the chain broke and the pipes went down to the bottom with quite a force, as you will readily understand. The pipes were about 300 feet in length. Since that time the well has not been functioning properly. Whether this has anything to do with the shortage of water or not, I am not in a position to say. I only wish to draw your attention to this point.\n\n\"What I would now suggest is this: There is an Indian living just a short distance west of the school...\"\nschool, by the name of Neil Yellow Wings.

There was a spring there at one time, but, of course, it may have dried up. The drilling of another well at the school should be considered in the event of all other plans failing; as, to my mind, the moving of the school to the river is altogether out of the question.\n\n\"The present school is a three storey building with a basement, of frame construction, lathed and plastered, with a flat roof.

There are also other buildings too numerous to mention, such as chicken coops, implement shed, shop, etc. The cost of taking these buildings down and hauling the material to the river and rebuilding would be enormous.\"\n\nIn view of the steadily multiplying demands upon the Department for the construction of Indian residential schools and the repair of others, it is not at all likely that we could obtain the money necessary to move the Sacred Heart School at any time in the immediate future. I am anxious, therefore, that you should ask Mr. Fetterly\nto make another investigation, with the comments made by Mr. Christiansen at his disposal. If the removal of the school is considered impracticable or too costly or if, on the other hand, the supply of water is limited, we may have to seriously consider a reduction of the enrolment at the school and perhaps the construction of a day school on another section of the reserve.\n\nT.

Lancaster, Indian Agent, Peigan Agency, Brocket P. O., re condition of the fire extinguishers at both Residential Schools on the reserve.\n\nThis matter was brought to my attention by the Principal when I visited the H. C. (Sacred Heart) School on the 15th instant. After taking two of the quart size (guns) apart, they were found to be useless; The pumping apparatus inside the brass container being badly corroded, brittle and eaten through by the acid. In one case the brass container (outside shell) was perforated, had leaked, and crumbled under the pressure of my thumb.\n\nI instructed Agent Lancaster to check those at the C. of E. (St. Cyprian's School), and if they were in bad repair to requisition direct to the Department for new ones.\n\nI strongly recommend that these extinguishers be renewed and would ask that the matter be taken up direct with the Agent, Mr. Lancaster.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC. Fant.

Indian Residential Schools, Peigan Agency:\n\nMr. H. C. Lancaster, Indian Agent, reports both these engines require overhauling. Both engines were overhauled at the schools in August, 1935, by the Bruce Robinson Electric Co., of Calgary, Agents for the Lister Bruston Co. I understand a thorough job was not done at that time through not having on hand at the reserve certain parts which it was found should be changed (renewed).\n\nMy recommendation is that both engines be brought to the Bruce Robinson Electric Company's shop here in Calgary, and thoroughly overhauled, this work to be done early in August, while the pupils are away on vacation.\n\nI have asked the Bruce Robinson Co. to write Mr. Agent Lancaster, giving him a detailed list of what parts should be renewed, work to be done, and the approximate cost; and have instructed Agent Lancaster to take the matter up with the Department direct.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC.

The work should, of course, be done by a firm on the approved list. Please let me know as soon as you can the cost of this work, as we intend to take the amount from that provided in the current year's appropriation for these schools.\n\nUntil we know what the cost of repairing these machines will be, the Department will be unable to authorize any further expenditure for repairs and improvements at the two schools mentioned above.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

Schmidt,\nAlberta Inspectorate,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nCalgary, Alta.\n\nRe: Wind Damage to R.C. School, Brocket, Alta.\n\nSir:\n\nPursuant to your instructions, I visited the above school yesterday, and was received by the Rev. Principal, Rev. Father Piaux, who afforded me every facility for making my inspection.\n\nI was accompanied by Mr. W.T. Scott, of Calgary, who has worked with me on a number of construction jobs for the Department, and has had wide experience in the building trade. Together we made a close examination of the damage resulting from the tremendous winds to which the school is exposed, and collaborated as to remedial measures necessary.\n\nBriefly stated, the damage is entirely confined to the west end of the building, and may be described as a \"bulging\" of the wall outwards to a maximum extent of three inches, and extending from about the level of the second floor to the level of the third floor. There appears no trouble below the second floor, nor could I notice any disturbance along the line of roof plate. The pressure of the high winds against the narrow west frame wall, and with the recurring push and rebound, has caused this wall to bulge outwards, as stated. On the inside of said wall there has developed a slight crack in the cornice. It is a condition which may rapidly become worse under high wind recur, and measures should be taken promptly to strengthen the affected end of the building.\n\nMy recommendations for strengthening the west end of the structure are as follows:\n\nRemove the metal cornice along the line of partition plates adjoining the corridors of the second floor, for 10 feet in length from outside wall. Then place a bar of iron, 3/8\" x 2\" by 10' long, securely bolted to plates with 4\" lag screws. The outer end of the iron bar to be round and threaded, and to extend through the outside wall and to receive a heavy plate 4 ft. in length. On the outside of said plate use a heavy washer, and double nuts. Two such plates, bars, etc., as described should be used on the second floor, and two on the first floor. Thus, when the nuts, bolts, plates, etc., are all properly screwed, the nuts should be tightened, which should have the effect of drawing in the \"bulge\" to a considerable extent, if not altogether, and also prevent the same trouble happening again.\n\nTo further stiffen and strengthen the building, I recommend that a rod of round iron of 7/8\" diameter by the width of the building (24') be placed across the building just under the ceiling of the ground floor, with plates and nuts on the outside walls at either end; a similar rod, with attachments, be placed across under the ceiling of the first floor. These rods should be placed, one directly above the other, just west of the front balcony. To facilitate handling, these long rods should be jointed in the centre by turnbuckles. Then by tightening the nuts at either end of these rods, the building would be held rigid at its vulnerable\nwest end where the heavy winds strike.\n\nBy drawing in the bulging wall at four different points, and by the further strengthening and stiffening of the building by the cross rods as described, the entire structure should become much more rigid than before, and further deterioration from wind action, such as remaining of the siding at the west end should be gone when nails have worked loose, and the plaster cracks in the interior corners at the west end of the building should be restored.\n\nRegarding the cost of the suggested work, it is difficult to give a close estimate. The required iron plates, rods, bars, etc., threaded and drilled as required, would cost about $40.00, FOB Calgary. Then there would be a good deal of cutting and making good. An experienced mechanic and helper might require a week to complete the work in a thorough manner. Perhaps a reasonable estimate of $150.00 might be cited as the probable cost, with an additional $50.00 leeway for repairing plaster and contingencies.\n\nAs the type of work outlined is quite out of the ordinary run of carpentry, I deem it very important that a thoroughly competent and well-versed man be employed. In this connection I would strongly recommend Mr. Scott. He is well and favorably known to the Department, and as he has shown me during my inspection of the damage, he knows exactly what is required to be done, and is competent to do it. No doubt a suitable helper could be procured locally. I append Mr. Scott's address below.\n\nAll the foregoing is respectfully submitted.\n\nYours faithfully\n\nE. Gardner-Smith\n\nW. J. Scott\n237 - 9\u00bd W. N.W.\nCalgary.\n\nWilliam Scott\nPoveshell Co.\nMississauga\nCalgary, September 2nd, 1937.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to report that when at Sacred Heart R.C. Indian Residential School, Peigan Agency, on the 10th ult., in company with Mr. M. Christianson, General Supt. of Indian Agencies, and Mr. H. C. Lancaster, Indian Agent, the Principal, Rev. Father Rusaux, drew our attention to certain damage done to the West (end) wall of the main building by a wind storm which passed over the district a few days before.\n\nAfter examining the building, it could be plainly seen that the centre of the wall had bulged out, where the studding plate had been cut to allow the placing of twin windows to provide light for the staircase well.\n\nMr. Christianson and I discussed the matter on our return to Calgary, and we decided it would be advisable to have a competent tradesman examine the building and make a report. I therefore asked Mr. E. Gardner-Smith, who was building inspector when the school was erected, to do so. I am attaching hereto Mr. Gardner-Smith's report, and would recommend that immediate steps be taken to have the building braced as suggested by him. In my opinion there is grave danger of serious and irremediable damage being done when another of these high winds, which are very frequent in the district, strikes this building. I might add that the members of the staff to whom I spoke were much concerned regarding the safety of the building.\n\nI should be pleased to receive instructions on the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC. Pant. Schmidt,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter from Inspector Schmidt with reference to damage done to the West wall of the Sacred Heart School by a windstorm.\n\nAs Mr. E. Gardner-Smith was the Supervisor at the time of the construction of the Sacred Heart School, he was requested to examine the building and report what repairs he considered necessary.\n\nHis recommendations for strengthening the West end of the structure are as follows:\n\n\"Remove the metal cornice along the line of partition plates adjoining the corridors of ground and 1st floor ceilings for 10 feet in length from outside wall. Then place a bar of iron 5/8\" x 2\" by 10' long, securely bolted to plates with 3\" lag screws. The outer end of the iron bar to be round and threaded, and to extend through the outside wall and to receive a heavy plate 4 ft. in length. On the outside of said plate use a heavy washer, etc., double nuts. To each plates, bars, etc., as described should be used on the ground floor, and two on the 1st floor. When these iron bars, plates, etc., are all securely attached, the nuts should be tightened, which should have the effect of drawing in the \"bulge\" to a considerable extent, if not altogether, and also prevent the same trouble happening again.\n\n\"To further stiffen and strengthen the building, I recommend that a rod of round iron of 7/8\" diameter by the width of the building (24') be placed across the building just under the ceiling of the ground floor, with plates and nuts on the outside walls at either end; and a similar rod, with attachments, be placed just under the ceiling of 1st floor. These rods should be placed, one directly above the other, just west of the front balcony. To facilitate handling, these long rods should be jointed in the centre by turnbuckles. Then by tightening the nuts at either end of these rods, the building would be held rigid at its vulnerable west end where the heavy winds strike.\n\n\"By drawing in the bulging wall at four different points, and by the further strengthening and stiffening of the building by the cross rods as described, the entire structure should become much more rigid than before, and further deterioration prevented. In addition,\"\n\"some remailing of the siding at the west end should be done where nails have worked loose, and the plaster cracks in the interior corners at the west end of the building should be restored.\n\nRegarding the cost of the suggested work, it is difficult to give a close estimate.

Perhaps a complete estimate of $150.00 might be cited as the probable cost, with an additional $60.00 leeway for repairing plaster and contingencies.\"\n\nYou will note from the above that Mr. Smith estimates the cost will not exceed $200.00. You may proceed with this work at once and engage the services of Mr. G. Fraser, of Pincher Creek, who was employed last year in the erection of the agency office. If his services are not available, you should consult Mr. P.O. McKenna, of Pincher Creek. Any material required should be secured from firms under the approved list.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Fetterly of the Calgary Office of our Dominion Water and Power Bureau on the above matter, and which was I think concurred in by officers of your Branch, recommended the drilling of a new well a few feet south of the present well at a total estimated cost of $1,673.29.\n\nFurther consideration has been given to this matter and it is our view that no definite assurance can be given that there will be any greater water available from another well in the immediate vicinity. It also appears that the existing well, which served satisfactorily in years of normal precipitation, should be given every opportunity to function. It further appears that this well will give a sufficient supply of water as soon as more rainfall occurs in the vicinity.\n\nConsequently, our senior engineering officers feel that the proper course is to clean out the existing well and deepen it to the extent that is practicable, rather than embark on an expenditure for a new well to the amount indicated. Under the circumstances, this is the course that is being followed and action will be taken immediately.\n\nDirector.\nOTTAWA, September 24, 1937.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. J.M. Wardle,\nDirector of Surveys & Engineering\n\nI have your memorandum of the 21st instant with reference to the water supply at the Sacred Heart Residential School, Brockton, Alberta.\n\nWith reference to the first paragraph, I may say that while Mr. Fetterly recommended the drilling of a new well, there is no record on our file of any officials of this branch consenting in that recommendation.\n\nWe note that you consider the proper course to follow is to clean out the existing well and deepen it to the extent that is practicable. This should be done at once, but it is expected, of course, that the cost will be kept as low as possible.\n\nDirector.\nEXTRACT FROM REQUISITION DATED SEPTEMBER 30th\nSACRED HEART RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nDials #10-P for the night Watchmen's clock 3 boxes.\nOttawa, November 1, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn requisition original received for supplies for the Sacred Heart Residential School, the Principal requested three boxes of dials No. 10-P for the night watchman's clock.

The well was cleaned of 25 feet of cave-in or sediment at the bottom and then deepened by the drilling of a 30-foot new hole in gray shale. The present equipment was repaired.\n\nResults were disappointing as tests made before and after work was done did not disclose any increase in water supply after the work was completed. Tests, however, did disclose that the maximum supply of water from the well can be obtained by pumping for 40 or 45 minutes at four equally spaced periods per day. It is apparently a waste of time to pump longer than 40 or 45 minutes at any one time. At the present time the water level is 240 feet below the top of the well. The measured capacity of the well is 600 gallons per day which of course is insufficient.\n\nOur engineers recommend that for the present the matter be left in abeyance to see if there will be any increase in the flow of water in the next three or four weeks.\n\nIt is the consensus of opinion that it would not be advisable to drill a new well in the vicinity\nof the present well and of course a new well located at a distance away from the School would be costly in view of the separate well house, electrical connections, heating trench, pipe, etc. that would be required.\n\nInstructions are being issued for a further measurement of the water supply in about three weeks' time.\n\nDirector.\nMr. Phelan,\n\nI am advised by Mr. Bateman of the Engineering and Construction Service that the amount of $222.50 should be transferred or rather advanced to his branch for the work on the water supply at the Sacred Heart School.\n\nYou will recall taking Fetterly's travelling expense accounts off the file the other day, these I forwarded to Mr. Bateman, and I understand they will be paid from the above advance.\n\nWill you arrange for the advance to the Engineering and Construction Service as I believe they are holding some accounts for payment?\n\nM.W.\n**REQUISITION FOR CHEQUE**\n\nTO BE USED FOR ADVANCES OR AUTHORIZED PAYMENTS FOR WHICH THERE ARE NO ACCOUNTS\n\n**DEPARTMENT:** Mines & Resources  \n**BRANCH:** Indian Affairs  \n**DATE:** November 12, 1937\n\nAPPLICATION IS HEREBY MADE FOR THE ISSUE OF THE FOLLOWING CHEQUE OR CHEQUES:\n\n| CHEQUE NO. | IN FAVOUR OF | AMOUNT |\n|------------|--------------|--------|\n|            | The Receiver General | $222.50 |\n\nCheque to be forwarded to:\nEngineering and Construction Service,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nJackson Bldg., Ottawa.\n\nSTATE BELOW, WITH DETAILS IN EVERY CASE, WHETHER (a) STANDING ADVANCE, (b) ADVANCE FOR SPECIFIC JOURNEY\u2014ESTIMATING NUMBER OF DAYS, (c) OTHER ACCOUNTABLE ADVANCE, OR (d) AUTHORIZED PAYMENT\n\nImproving water supply - Sacred Heart Indian Residential School (#789)\n\n| VOTE | ENC.

This matter has been discussed with the Director of the Indian Affairs Branch and, under the circumstances, it is agreed that a new well should be drilled immediately at the point suggested by the inspecting engineer.\n\nWill you kindly send out instructions by wire for well drilling operations to start immediately, subject of course to weather conditions permitting. Maughan Brothers, of Lethbridge, mentioned by Mr. Fetterly in his report can be asked to do this work at the price of $1.40 per foot for drilling, provided this is regarded as reasonable for the district. Casing, well pipe and other material that is needed during actual drilling of the well will have to be purchased as an emergency from approved firms in the district. The drilling contractors would submit their charges in an account in the usual way and which would be certified by our Engineer.\n\nThe latter should also prepare a bill of material on which quotations could be called for on pumping equipment, supply pipe, etc. It would be proposed to have this material in order for immediate purchase if water is secured in the well.\nThe Director of the Indian Affairs Branch understands that there is no guarantee of water being obtained and that the cost of drilling the well and of such casing, etc., as may be necessary during drilling operations is in the nature of an exploratory investment.\n\nOur Engineer should be instructed to report to you by wire as to the result of the drilling operations.\n\nIt is of course understood that no trenching or other work will be undertaken unless water is obtained.\n\nIt is not proposed to use the windmill pumping equipment, provided the Engineer's estimate for the gasoline pump, etc., is confirmed when quotations are called for.\n\nIt is understood from Mr. Fetterly's report that the investment necessary in order to determine whether or not water will be available in the new well will be between $600 and $700, and the Director of the Indian Affairs Branch has advised me that he will try and make an amount available for drilling operations up to $1,000, if required.\n\nDirector.\nBROCKET ALTA 23 1040A\n\nTHE SECRETARY INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\nDEPT MINES & RESOURCES OTTAWA\n\nSEPTIC TANK AND SEWER R C SCHOOL PLUGGED UP PLEASE WIRE AUTHORITY TO ENGAGE PLUMBER\n\nH C LANCASTER\nOttawa,\nFebruary 23, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your telegram of the 23rd instant I wish to confirm the following night lettergram sent you today:\n\nMAY ENGAGE PLUMBER TO CLEAR SEPTIC TANK AND SEWER SACRED HEART SCHOOL STOP KEEP EXPENDITURE AS LOW AS POSSIBLE.\n\nPlease let me have a report stating the reasons why the septic tank and sewer became plugged.

As the usual wholesale price to the Government for this casing, according to Mr. Hoover, is $1.21\u00bd per foot, he instructed Maughan Brothers to use the casing they had on hand, thus avoiding the necessity of ordering more casing than might possibly be required if water was found sooner than expected. This arrangement of Mr. Hoover's with regard to casing is concurred in as, under the circumstances, it would appear to be the most satisfactory arrangement. Mr. Hoover further advises that Maughan Brothers informed him they can get more casing if needed, although whether it would be at the $1.14 per foot is not stated.\n\nMr. Hoover has also supplied a requisition for material that will be required if water is obtained.\n\nDirector.\nPincher Creek, Alta.

There is no plan of the sewage line at the school, therefore it was necessary to do more digging in order to locate the pipes outside of the building. I would suggest Blue Prints be obtained and kept accessible in the Principal's office for reference under similar circumstances, also an outfit of cleaning tools be supplied to be used for the two schools, the staff could then do the work & keep costs down.\n\nThis bill was incurred in renewing pipes in the superheating tank in the boilerroom, in connection with the circulation of water for heating the radiators.

C. School, together with Mr. W. V. Webb, Clerk-in-Charge of the Agency. I did not make an inspection but discussed matters generally with Rev. Mr. Simcox, the principal, who stated that everything was going along nicely and no sickness amongst the pupils; BUT: The question of water supply was again to the fore!\n\nAs the Department know, the new well sunk this Spring was abandoned through lack of water and the casing taken out (salvaged). As it is, the supply of water is insufficient for proper flushing of toilets and bathing. The new well was sunk a distance of several hundred feet South from the buildings, on the slopes of a hill which would be in favour of sinking another well a few feet from the original well near the centre of the power room and laundry. A good supply of water was found when the original well was sunk; this later diminished. The reason for this I cannot ascertain as there seems to be conflicting theories, and I am satisfied no one knows the cause. One theory is that the casing was bent at the bottom which prevented further drilling. Another is that the lower part of the casing fills with silt and cannot be cleaned. This might be the cause.\n\nMr. E. Gardner-Smith in his report dated Oct. 9th, 1931, states that the lower 50 feet of the casing was perforated; also that the lower 50 feet is 6 inches in diameter, while the other (or top) of this is 5 5/8 inches. What effect this would have on the well, and how the two sizes of casing are joined together, I cannot say. Mr. Gardner-Smith, in his report, last paragraph, favours sinking a new well near the original one.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC. Pant. Schmidt,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\n\nDoctor Harold W. McGill,\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa,\nMay 20, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 12th instant with reference to the water situation at the Sacred Heart Indian Residential School. I am requesting the Surveys & Engineering Branch to have one of their engineers call on you and possibly both of you could visit the Sacred Heart School and decide what is the best course to be taken.\n\nWe have no funds specifically provided for another well at this school but we have a small unallotted balance from which we might be able to obtain the cost of a new well if this is absolutely necessary.\n\nI realize that it is extremely difficult to be assured that water will be secured before starting operations but when visiting the school with the engineer you should consider the matter very carefully in order that he may report fully to us. If at all possible we wish to avoid the previous experience of spending considerable funds without obtaining water.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nG. P. Schmidt, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nCalgary, Alta.\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nSurveys & Engineering Branch.\n\nRe: Well at Sacred Heart Indian Residential School.\n\nIn your memorandum of April 6 you advised that instructions had been issued to pull the casing in the new well that had been dug at the Sacred Heart Residential School as the flow of water was insufficient.\n\nToday I am in receipt of a report from Mr. C. F. Schmidt, Inspector of Indian Agencies, Calgary, which reads in part as follows:\n\n\"As the Department know, the new well sunk this Spring was abandoned through lack of water and the casing taken out (salvaged). As it is, the supply of water is insufficient for proper flushing of toilets and bathing. The new well was sunk a distance of several hundred feet south from the buildings, on the slopes of a hill.

A good supply of water was found when the original well was sunk; this latter diminished. The reason for this I cannot ascertain as there seems to be conflicting theories, and I am satisfied no one knows the cause. One theory is that the casing was bent at the bottom, which prevented further drilling. Another is that the lower part of the casing fills with silt and cannot be cleaned. This might be the cause.\"\nMr. E. Gardner-Smith in his report dated Oct. 9th, 1931, states that the lower 60 feet of the casing was perforated; also, that the lower 60 feet is 5 inches in diameter, while the other (or top) of this is 5 5/8 inches. What effect this would have on the well, and how the two sizes of casing are joined together, I cannot say. Mr. Gardner-Smith, in his report, last paragraph, favours sinking a new well near the original one.\n\nI would appreciate if you would arrange to have one of your engineers again interview Mr. Schmidt and possibly both of them could visit the Sacred Heart Residential School and a report could then be submitted to us.\n\nWe have no funds specially provided for another well at this school in the current year's appropriation but there is a small amount that is unallotted and if the school cannot possibly operate without having more water we will endeavour to provide the necessary funds.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, May 16th, 1938.\n\nMINES & RESOURCES\n\nDISPOSAL OF SURPLUS STORES - J.P.

In forwarding the account for the expenditure that Branch stated that there was 100 feet of casing that had not been used. They advised that the well driller was prepared to give $75.00 for this casing and the Surveys & Engineering Branch recommended that this amount be deducted from his account.\n\nThe Salvage Officer was phoned and he stated that it would be in order to do this. Consequently, the amount of $75.00 was deducted from the well driller's account and a cheque was forwarded to the Salvage Officer.\n\nDirector.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Wardle.\n\nRe: Well at Sacred Heart Indian Residential School.\n\nI have your memorandum of the 26th instant with reference to the above and enclosing copy of a memorandum you received from the Director of the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nIt is felt that all the points raised by Mr. Schmidt, Inspector of Indian Agencies, Calgary, in his letter to Dr. McGill, must have been known and taken into account by Mr. Hoover during recent more or less protracted efforts that have been made to secure water at this point. You will recall in this connection that only last fall the old well was cleaned out, but without any beneficial results as far as increase of water supply was concerned. I am, however, writing Mr. Hoover for his comments on Mr. Schmidt's letter, and upon receipt of his reply you will be further advised.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nJ.M.

McGill,\n\nI am enclosing a copy of Salvage Minute No. 11126, of the 16th instant, in connection with the disposal of a quantity of old pipe to J.F. Maughan, of Lethbridge, Alberta, for the sum of $75.00. It is understood that this old material came from the Sacred Heart Indian School at Brocket, Alberta.\n\nWith a copy of this memorandum a cheque for the sum of $75.00 is being forwarded to the Chief Treasury Officer.\n\nAs this Minute is the first intimation on record here, would you kindly advise me regarding the details of this sale, such as the quantity of pipe considered surplus.\n\nDepartmental Purchasing Agent.\nDEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR\nDominion Water Power and Hydroelectric Bureau\nCalgary, Alta., June 13, 1935.\n\nSacred Heart Indian School\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to your letter of 31st ultimo, your File I.A.1650-4, a conference was held in this office on even date between Messrs. R.A. Hoey of the Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa; C.F. Collins, Superintendent of Indians, Calgary; and Mr. Fetterly, of the Water and Power Bureau, Calgary; the subject being the possible construction of a new well at the above-named School.\n\nIt was unanimously decided to recommend the immediate drilling of a new well within a few feet of the original well near the Engine room as first recommended in the report dated August 31, 1937. The estimates will be found on page 4 of this report, the total cost being estimated at $1675.89.\n\nThe committee certainly does not guarantee that water will be found at that, or any other depth, at this, or any other point, near the school.\n\nThe three points considered were near Yellowwings house 1500 feet South west of the school where a well exists with several feet of water; a location half-a-mile west of the School under the hill at another Indians 60 foot well; and the one near the engine room mentioned above. The first two would necessitate trenching and pipe.\n\nIt must be understood that at the best, this also will have to be considered as an exploratory well although the old well delivered a large supply of water. Whether the original well was defective because of the perforations at 60 feet or lower casing, or the hole was crooked or present lack of water is not known. The original hole cannot be very crooked or Mr. Maughan could not have deepened the original well a further 30' as he did last fall.\n\nHowever, the Committee now recommend that a\n\nT.S. Mills,\nChief Engineer,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nnew well be drilled near the engine room as described above.\n\nIt is possible that the driller may ask \u00a340 per foot for 300 feet and \u00a365 per foot for the remainder.\n\nAll details of requirements appear to be shown on page 4 of the report of August 17, 1937.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(sgd) O.H. Hoover\n\nO.M. Hoover,\nEngineer-In-Charge.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Wardle\n\nRe: Well at Sacred Heart Indian Residential School.\n\nFurther to my memorandum of the 31st ultimo with reference to the above, a report has now been received from Mr. Hoover, copy of which is attached. It will be noted from Mr. Hoover's report that a conference was held in his office between Messrs. R.A. Hoey of the Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa; C.P. Schmidt, Inspector of Indian Agencies, Calgary; and P.A. Fetterly representing Mr. Hoover. According to Mr. Hoover's report the unanimous decision was to recommend the immediate drilling of a new well within a few feet of the original well. The estimated cost of this work is $1675.29, the breakdown of which is shown in Mr. Fetterly's report which accompanied our memorandum to you of September 13, 1937.\n\nIt will be noted that any work undertaken can only be considered as of an exploratory nature and no guarantee is given that water will be found at the point recommended or at any other point near the school. Under the circumstances, there does not, however, appear to be any option other than to concur in the recommendation of the above mentioned committee providing the Indian Affairs Department, from their knowledge of the situation, considers it necessary to have an increased water supply at this point, and further can make provision for the required funds.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nJ.M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n28th June, 1938.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill\n\nRe: Well at Sacred Heart Indian Residential School.\n\nI am forwarding herewith copy of a memorandum from our Chief Engineer with a report from Mr. Hoover embodying a recommendation for the drilling of a new well at the above school.\n\nIt will be noted that the committee comprising Mr. Hoey, Mr. Schmidt and Mr. Fetterly, is unanimous in recommending the drilling of the new well. The estimated cost is $1,673.29.\n\nKindly advise if you approve of this work going ahead and if the required funds can be provided.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nREQUISITION FOR SUPPLIES\n\nJune 26th, 1936.\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF Sacred Heart Indian Res.

Funds for the purpose are available in the appropriation for Indian Education, and I would appreciate receiving the approval of the Honourable the Minister to transfer this amount to the Surveys and Engineering Branch and to authorize them to proceed immediately with the digging of a new well.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, Ontario,\nJuly 6, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo enclosing requisitions covering material for painting the interior of the Sacred Heart Indian Residential School.\n\nIn preparing our estimates for the current fiscal year, it was only found possible to include an amount of $800 for improvements and general repairs to Sacred Heart school during the fiscal year. We have already expended an amount of $663.75 on repairs to the water system. Recent developments show that this expenditure was not sufficient, and it now appears that it will be necessary to dig a new well at a cost of approximately $1700.\n\nIn view of the present set up of our appropriation, it will be extremely difficult for the Department to secure this extra amount, but we expect to be able to do so and hope that it will insure an adequate water supply.\n\nHowever, in view of the extra expense that we will have to incur in this regard, it will not be possible to favourably consider supplying the paint requested in your letter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division\n\nT.

Jackson,\nChief Executive Assistant.\nOttawa, July 14, 1928.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR,\nSurveys & Engineering Branch:\nRe: Well at Sacred Heart Indian Residential School.\n\nOn receipt of your memorandum of June 28th, in connection with the above, I wrote the Deputy Minister with a view to obtaining the authority of the Honourable the Minister for the expenditure mentioned in your memorandum. Today I am in receipt of the following reply:\n\n\"Referring to your memorandum of the 4th instant in reference to the above matter, which was discussed by you with the Deputy Minister yesterday, approval is given to the drilling of this well, providing, of course, the necessary inquiries have been made from the Mines and Geology Branch as to the possibility of securing a satisfactory supply of water if the well is drilled.\"\n\nI trust that you will be able to arrange for digging this well at an early date, and the amount of $1,675.29 will be transferred to your Branch when requested by you.\n\nDirector.\nDear Sir:\n\nI am writing to you on behalf of Rev. Father Routhier, our new Provincial, who replaced Father Langlois. Having been Provincial Procurator for the past two years, I have been in touch with our Indian schools and am more in condition to know their needs, for the present at least.\n\nWe have another proposal to make to you. The school at Brocket needs to be enlarged. Well we have at McLeod a school that has been abandoned by the Sep. S.D. This is a brick building 65 x 65 feet. We had a contractor from Lethbridge to look at the building. This contractor estimated that, after allowing for breakage, 100,000 bricks could be salvaged. He estimated the cut stone at 840 cubic feet. The windows, sashes, doors, and lumber are in good condition. The building belongs to the Oblate Fathers and we offer it free to the Department to be used for the addition at Brocket. You would have only the cost of salvaging the material and hauling them at Brocket which is only twenty two miles from McLeod.\n\nHoping these proposals will be taken into consideration by your department.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nL. La Rose. O.M.I.\nProv. Proc.\n\n9916-110th St.\nEdmonton, Alta.\nJuly 20, 1938.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI desire to refer to that portion of your letter of the 13th instant in which you offer to allow this Department to demolish an old building, owned by the Oblate Order at Macleod, so that the material that is salvaged can be used for an addition to the Sacred Heart Indian Residential School.\n\nNo provision was made in our current year's appropriation for an expenditure of this nature and, under these circumstances, it is not possible to favourably consider your offer at the present time. I might add that we do not appear to have received any recent request for enlarging the Sacred Heart School.\n\nFor your information I may state that the water situation at the Sacred Heart School has been causing us considerable concern. Early in the year an amount was spent in an endeavour to improve the existing well but without success. Recently, authority has been given for the digging of a new well at an approximate cost of $1,650. It is hoped that it will be found possible to obtain a plentiful supply of water.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nSecretary.\n\nReverend L. LaRose, O.M.I.,\n9916 - 110th Street,\nEdmonton, Alberta.\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill\n\nRe: Well, Sacred Heart Indian Residential School.\n\nWith reference to your memorandum of the 14th instant regarding the above, I should be pleased if you would take the necessary action to have transferred to the Engineering and Construction Service the sum of $1,675.00 to cover this work.\n\nAs soon as the transfer of this money is effected immediate arrangements will be made for the digging of this well.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nJuly 24, 1936.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY\n\nRe: Sacred Heart Residential School, Brocket, Alberta.\n\nPlease transfer from Vote 168 to the Surveys & Engineering Branch an amount of $1,675.00 for the drilling of a well at the above-mentioned school.\n\nThe lack of water at the Sacred Heart School has become so serious that the Surveys & Engineering Branch were requested some weeks ago to have one of their engineers make an exhaustive survey and he reports that the only possible solution is to drill a new well. The Honourable the Minister has approved of this action.\n\nActing Director.\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nSurveys & Engineering Branch\n\nRe: Well Sacred Heart Indian Residential School.\n\nWith reference to your memorandum of July 28 in connection with the above I am requesting the Representative of the Treasury to transfer to your Branch the amount of $1,675.00.\n\nActing Director.\nCalgary, July 26th, 1938.\n\nRe: Water Supply, Sacred Heart Indian Residential School, Pelican Agency.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to enquire whether a decision has been arrived at regarding the sinking of a new well a few feet from the old one at the above school:\n\nI understand that Mr. O. H. Hoover, Engineer in Charge, Water Power Bureau, Calgary, reported on this matter to Mr. T. S. Mills, Chief Engineer, Ottawa, on the 13th ultimo.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC. Pant.

Purpose of Report.\nPursuant to instructions received from T.S. Mills, Esq., Chief Engineer, Surveys and Engineering Branch, Ottawa; the construction of a new well at the above-named school was begun on September 5. Advice having been received from the driller, Joe Maughan, on September 24th that the hole was drilled, the writer proceeded on September 26 to Brocket to test the yield. This report is an elaboration of the wire sent you on September 28.\n\n2. Findings.\nIt was found that the well had been drilled at the proposed location 10' south of the old well to a depth of 295 feet. A small amount of water had been encountered at 70 ft. & 165 ft., and an apparently much larger amount at 245 ft. The amount entering between 245 feet and 295 feet is not known. The material to 70 feet is surface soil. The remainder is sandrock and shale.\n\nAfter the rest over Sunday the well was found to contain 104 feet of water. The bailer was then started. During the first 20 minutes or so the water was lowered about 50 feet. The baling test was continued for a total of two hours and during the last hour and a half or more the water was lowered about three feet only.\nThis would seem to indicate that the most of the water comes from about 245 feet to 250 feet. A total of 640 gallons of water was bailed out in exactly two hours. The bailer has a capacity of 7 gallons, and 92 bail-fulls were extracted, an average of one bail per minute and eighteen seconds, or nearly 5 1/8 gallons per minute.\n\nThe use of the bailer is of course intermittent, not continuous, as would be the case with a pump. It was not considered advisable to continue the bailing as a test.\n\nFather Riaux, the Principal, mentioned that he had all of the water he needed at present from the old deep well together with the supply from the spring but was apprehensive that the supply would diminish to little or nothing by January and February as it has always done, and that then he would be in as great difficulties as ever. However there is a limit to speculation, consequently one has to take matters as they exist now, and not consider future conditions.\n\nMr. Maughan, the driller, then suggested that he rent a pump, pipe, rods, and test the yield in a more efficient manner. The cost of rental, plus work in freighting this rented equipment from Lethbridge (55 miles), installation, carrying on the test, etc., would amount to $104.00.\n\nNot wishing to decide this point without consideration, the writer then proceeded to Calgary for consultation regarding this proposed extra expenditure.\n3. Conclusion.\n\nIt is possible or even probable that the 245 ft. water vein has been present all the time but could not get into the casing of the old well and that is the reason for failure of the well to produce.\n\nIncidentally, when the drill reached the 165 ft. depth the old well became muddied to such an extent that pumping of the water from the old well had to be stopped or the plumbing system would be plugged. Apparently the water was escaping from the new hole through fissures to the old well.\n\nA further report will be made later.\n\n(sgd) P.A. Fetterly\n\n(sgd) O.H. Hoover\nEngineer-in-charge.\n\nCalgary, Alberta,\nSeptember 30, 1938.\n8th October, 1938.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill\n\nRe: Sacred Heart Indian School Well.\n\nIn connection with the above, I am forwarding herewith a copy of a report by Mr. Fetterly on the new well drilled at the Sacred Heart Indian School at Brocket, Alberta. It will be noted that a further report will be submitted as soon as a complete test has been made of the well. It will also be noted that Father Riaux has stated that he has had all the water he needed from the old deep well and a supply from the spring but was apprehensive that the supply would diminish to minimum during January and February as it has always done.\n\nWhen we have a further report from Mr. Hoover a copy will be forwarded to you.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nOctober 14, 1938.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nSurveys & Engineering Branch\n\nRe: Well at Sacred Heart Indian Residential School\n\nI am in receipt of your memorandum of October 8 enclosing a report from Mr. Hoover and Mr. Fetterly.\n\nIf you consider it advisable you may authorize the expenditure of $104.00 to cover the cost of the rental of the necessary equipment to test the yield of the new well in an efficient manner.

Victor Webb,\nClerk in Charge Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa\n\nForm No. IA. 518\nDOMINION WATER POWER AND HYDROMETRIC BUREAU\n\nCalgary, Alta.\nNovember 5, 1938.\n\nNew Well at Sacred Heart Indian School.\n\nSir,\n\nHaving been advised by Mr. J.F. Maughan, driller, that he was ready to carry on a test of the yield of the new well, I instructed Mr. Fetterly to watch the test. He proceeded to Brocket on Monday, October 31. He reports as follows:\n\n\"Mr. Maughan began preparations about 1:00 p.m., on October 31, inserting the 3\" pipe and the octagonal rods, both of which were originally in 20 foot sections, and attaching the well-drilling outfit for pumping. By 7:30 p.m. all was ready for the test.\n\nPumping of the new well began at 7:34 p.m. At the beginning it produced at the rate of 560 gallons per hour (full capacity due to emptying the casing). Pumping was continued at the rate of 23 strokes per minute, 16\" stroke, 2 3/4\" cylinder.\n\nAt 8:45 p.m. the old pump was started after having been idle for a time. It produced 260 gallons per hour at the beginning, with 36 strokes per min., 6\" stroke, 2 3/4\" cylinder, on the regular pump jack.\n\nThe two pumps were run together from 7:52 p.m. to 9:10 a.m. All yields are at the rate of gallons per minute.\n\nAt 2:00 a.m. the new well made 180 gallons per hour, and the old well made 225 gallons per hour.\n\nAt 8 a.m. the new well made 120 gallons while the old well made 150 gallons per hour.\n\nThe old well was shut off at 9:10 a.m. An attempt being now proposed to find out any interrelation, if any. The new well was continued.\n\nAt 10:30 a.m. the new well produced 170 gallons.\nAt 10:45 a.m. the old well was started (the new one still going) and produced 200 gallons per minute.\nAt 10:50 a.m. the new well produced 150 gallons with both workings.\nAt 11:00 a.m. the old well produced 210 gallons with both workings.\nAt 11:06 a.m. the new well was shut off.\nAt 11:13 a.m. with the new well shut off, the old well produced 250 gallons per hour.\nAt 11:28 a.m. with the new well still shut off the old well produced 215 gallons.\nAt 11:30 a.m. the old well was stopped and the new one started.\n\nT.S. Miller, Esq.,\nChief Engr., Surveying and Engineering Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nAt 2:10 p.m., the new well, working alone, produced 140 gallons.\nAt 3:00 p.m., the new well produced 145 gallons.\n\nPumping then ceased on the new well, the old one having stopped at 11:30 a.m.\n\nIt was considered inadvisable to carry on the test any longer as the cost of a thorough test such as this is $2.00 per hour. Mr. Maughen stated that although he was working on the test with two other men continuously from 1:00 p.m. Monday to 3:30 p.m. Tuesday he would consider it as the usual 24 hour test.\n\nOn consent being given he began to dismantle the rig and also the pipes connecting the old well with the outside.\n\nThe 3\" pipe and the rods were left in the well for the present. He stated that the pipes and rods could be pulled at any time and the casing could also probably be pulled if that decision were made within a few weeks.\n\nHe then moved the rig to Cowley where a job is insistently waiting.\n\nA recapitulation of the testing activities follow:\n| Time       | Old Pump | New Pump | Yield of old well gal. per hour | Yield of new well gal. per hour |\n|------------|----------|----------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| 7:30 p.m.  |          |          |                                |                                |\n| 7:34 p.m.  |          | Started  |                                | 560                            |\n| 7:58 p.m.  |          | Started  |                                |                                |\n| 2:00 a.m.  | Both going |        | 260                             |                                |\n| 5:00 a.m.  |          |          | 225                             | 180                            |\n| 9:10 a.m.  | Old well shut off |    | 150                             | 120                            |\n| 10:30 a.m. | New well going |      |                                | 170                            |\n| 10:45 a.m. | Old well started | both wells going | 200                             |                                |\n| 10:50 a.m. |          |          |                                | 130                            |\n| 11:00 a.m. |          |          |                                |                                |\n| 11:08 a.m. | New well shut off |      | 210                             |                                |\n| 11:15 a.m. |          |          |                                |                                |\n| 11:25 a.m. |          |          | 250                             |                                |\n| 11:30 a.m. | Old well stopped & New well started | | 215                             |                                |\n| 2:10 p.m.  | New well giving only |      |                                | 140                            |\n| 3:00 p.m.  |          |          |                                |                                |\n| 3:00 p.m.  | New well stopped. |      |                                | 145                            |\nThe test having lasted about 20 continuous hours should give conclusive results.\"\n\nAt the end of the drilling proper, on Sept. 24, Mr. Fetterly proceeded to Brocket and measured the new hole. A baling test was made (See Report dated September 30) for 2 hours, which was the limit the driller wished to continue in this primitive and free method, and it was found that 640 gallons were baled out in two hours. The results of this test appeared to be conclusive to all concerned, that the well was a good producer.\n\nIt was mentioned in the report of September 30 that, as the preliminary, and apparently conclusive, test proved so favourable that certain material be purchased. It was also mentioned that Mr. Maughan would provide the necessary material, subject on the conclusive result. No reply being made to this suggestion, it was decided that the materials be ordered and used, first for a conclusive test and then for the final construction, as all concerned were convinced that the well was a producer and that the test would be made as of a formal nature only. The casing necessarily had to be ordered anyway while drilling was in operation. The 3\" pipe and octagonal rods were obtained on Oct. 18.\n\nI was surprised to receive a letter on Oct. 24 authorizing the expenditure of $104.00 for Maughan's offer to supply certain material, as the matter of purchasing the material had been mentioned and not denied.\n\nI will now return to the test of Oct. 31 - Nov. 1. All of the participants were greatly elated over preliminary results. From 7:30 p.m. to about 9:30 p.m. the two wells were producing over 600 gallons per hour. At about 10 p.m. the yield began to lessen slightly until, at 2 a.m., the total yield was down to 100 gallons, still fair yield. However, by 6 a.m. it had lessened to 50 gallons and at 11 a.m. the total amount was 340 gallons, with both wells running. The old well was stopped at 11:08 a.m. owing to expense of running the school machinery. There seems to be some small relationship between the wells but the total continuous yield does seem to present to be in the vicinity of 350 gallons per hour. The clean water of the old well did not appear to be affected by the slightly muddy water of the new one.\n\nIt might be stated that by 3 p.m. all participants were considerably discouraged over the final results. Father Rioux, the Father who claims that both spring and old well are producing all the water they need at present, but that in January and February, the yield in spring will be disastrously lessened according to previous experience. He claims when Pincher Creek freezes up the source of supply for both well and spring will cease as the spring and well both increase in yield three days after a heavy rain or rising of the creek.\nFather Rioux's last statement on Nov. 1st was to the effect that this new well is not producing the amount of water that the old well produces at present (this is proved by the enclosed table) and the old well goes dry in dry weather. Therefore, he is no better off than before in his opinion.\n\nIt might be mentioned that both working barrels and octagonal rods in the old well will not survive another extraction.\n\nThe possibility of activating both wells alternately was discussed with Father Rioux. In reply he stated that the school funds would not stand a battery of half a dozen pumps each producing a small amount of water. It would necessitate study of the flow of both wells and of the time each occupies in filling up. Unfortunately, after about one-half hour's pumping the old well begins to \"suck\" as it were and only produces a small amount. In other words, the basin more or less fills up during a rest and then is discharged in the next five-to-half hour or less. The new well acts much similarly. Using the wells alternately would be a considerable hardship to the school engineer.\n\nFather Rioux claims that at present the gas for running the pump and automobile costs $60.00 per month, of which over $50 is for the pump.\n\nThe conclusion to be reached is that the problem of supplying the school with water is almost, but not quite, as far off as ever, although both pumps activating alternately would help the situation.\n\nThe final feeling of Father Rioux, Mr. Maughan, Mr. Pearson, the Pincher Creek plumber and Mr. Fetterly was one of discouragement.\n\nWe hesitate to make any further recommendations which might involve considerable expenditure in developing the new well which in all probability will prove to be a small producer in critical times.\n\nIt would appear however that by developing the second well some additional water might be made available. Father Rioux is certainly averse to the development of this second well owing to additional expense and worry to the school engineer, and as the general cost to the Indian Department is a vital consideration we now prefer to leave the matter in the hands of a higher authority and to have definite instructions before making any move to develop this new well. In the meantime therefore we declined to make any definite recommendations as to the drilling of further wells after the old well was unsuccessful cleaned out, although we made several suggestions.\n\nMeanwhile, the matter will remain as at present.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(sgd) O.H. Hoover.\n\nEngineer-in-Charge.\nNovember 16, 1938.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Wardle.\n\nRe: Well, Sacred Heart Indian School.\n\nThe question of shortage of water at the above school is a matter that has received the consideration of this Service since May, 1937. During the intervening period since the above date numerous investigations and subsequent reports have been carried out in the field by Mr. Hoover. These field inspections covered a considerable area around the school and also extended to a consideration of moving the present buildings to some area where water might be more easily obtained.\n\nActual new work carried out has consisted of cleaning out the old well, drilling a new well at a point about one thousand feet south of the school, and last drilling another new well a few feet from the old well. None of these efforts have unfortunately been successful in so far as obtaining a sufficient supply of water is concerned.\n\nUnder date of the 5th instant a field report has been received from Mr. Hoover covering final tests run on the new well close to the old one, drilling of which was recently completed. A copy of this report is attached. This report is rather lengthy, but only one conclusion can be drawn from the information given, namely, that this last well has not been successful, and further that the problem of securing water for this school has not yet been solved. In this connection Mr. Hoover states \"the conclusion to be reached is that the problem of supplying the school with water is almost but not quite as far off as ever, although both pumps activating alternately would help the situation\".\n\nMr. Hoover further advises \"we hesitate to make any further recommendations which might involve considerable expenditure in developing the new well which in all probability will prove to be a small producer in critical times\".\n\nWith regard to the matter of activating both wells alternately referred to in the above quotation from Mr. Hoover's letter, it will be noted that Father Rioux has advised Mr. Hoover that the new well is not producing the amount of water that the old well produces at present. Further, Father Rioux does not feel that the school finances would stand the expenditure involved in operating a number of gasoline pumps. In addition to the cost of\n\nJ.M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys & Engineering Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\noperating, if both wells were used alternately, it would be necessary for the school engineer to give a lot of time to watching the pumping operations and switching from one well to the other as conditions necessitate. As regards cost, Father Rigou claims that at present the cost for running one pump is $30.00 per month.\n\nWith regard to the drilling of this last well now under discussion, it will be recalled that last season the question of drilling a well close to the old one was under consideration, but there seemed cause for doubt as to whether water could be expected in a well drilled close to a well which had failed in dry weather. The drilling of this well was only recently undertaken on the unanimous recommendation of Messrs. R.A. Hooper of the Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, C.F. Schmidt, Inspector of Indian Agencies, Calgary, and P.A. Fetterly of the Water and Power Bureau, Calgary, as a final experiment after all other possible sources of obtaining water had been unsuccessfully tried out.\n\nIt will be noted from Mr. Hoover's letter that under the circumstances, he does not feel in a position to make any recommendation as regards to what further action should be taken, the only suggestion offered by him being the development of the new well so that both wells could be operated. However, as he points out this will mean considerable annual cost to the Indian Affairs Branch for operation and is, therefore, apparently a matter for their decision. As none of the responsible parties have been following the situation on the ground and are familiar with all conditions, it seems to have any further suggestions to offer, this office is not in a position to make a recommendation as to what should be done. It might, however, be noted that a suggestion made some months ago, namely, the moving of the buildings to some new location where a permanent water supply can be assured is always a possible alternative.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n[Signature]\n\nF.J. Miller\n23rd November, 1938.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill\n\nRe: Well, Sacred Heart Indian School.\n\nWith reference to the above I advised you by telephone the circumstances in regard to the drilling of wells at this point and the unsatisfactory results. I am forwarding a copy of a memorandum from our Chief Engineer together with a report from Mr. Hoover.\n\nBriefly, the report is that notwithstanding the drilling of a new well at a point 1,000 feet south of the school and the drilling of another new well a few feet from the old one, none of these have been successful in obtaining a sufficient supply of water. Our Engineers do not feel like recommending that any further expenditure be made in the matter of obtaining water from wells and it would appear that the only solution will be to alternate between the wells and the supply be supplemented, when necessary, by the hauling of water. Otherwise it would appear that the only satisfactory solution would be the moving of the buildings to some new location where a permanent water supply can be assured.\n\nDirector.\n\"The final feeling of Father Rioux, Mr. Maughan, Mr. Pearson, the Pincher Creek plumber and Mr. Fetterly was one of discouragement.\n\n\"We hesitate to make any further recommendations which might involve considerable expenditure in developing the new well which in all probability will prove to be a small producer in critical times.\n\n\"It would appear however that by developing the second well, some additional water might be made available.

Do you consider that this would be more expensive than pumping from only one well and, if so, I should like to know why this is the case.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\"\nDear Sir:\n\nIn a memorandum dated the 23rd ultimo the Surveys & Engineering Branch reported fully regarding the action they had taken in attempting to secure water at the Sacred Heart Indian Residential School. The results are extremely disappointing and the Engineering Branch does not feel disposed to recommend any further expenditure at the present time.\n\nPart of Mr. Hoover's report read as follows:\n\n\"The possibility of activating both wells alternately was discussed with Father Rioux. In reply he stated that the school finances would not stand a battery of half a dozen pumps each producing a small amount of water. It would necessitate study of the flow of both wells and of the time each occupies in filling up.

The cost I would consider will approximate $75.00, also may I be advised as to who should be engaged to do the work, Mr. Stanley Pearson in the past has always done our plumbing & sewage work, but I do think he is on the list now. He is the only plumber in Pincher Creek, but there are more in Macleod.\n\nLast spring I asked the Department to supply us with a set of tools for cleaning sewer pipes, in order to lower the cost of repairs in this connection, as I understand these have been supplied to the R/C school on the Blood Reserve, & they are then able to keep the pipes clean themselves.

It has to be built in sections, then placed inside the boiler & connected up. I spoke to Mr Pearson today about it being out of order, he suggests using Brass tubing, as the water will not affect it.

Father A. Rusaux, Principal of Sacred Heart Indian Residential School, when he remarked that the gasoline engine in the power room at the school was very badly worn and would have to be replaced or repaired. I understood him to say that a mechanic (expert) from Bruce Robinson Electric, Ltd., Calgary, had been to the school a short time ago to repair this engine, and that he (the mechanic) had remarked that it was so badly worn that it was not worth the cost of sending it to the Calgary shop for overhauling. I also understood the Principal to say that he would write a letter, or report, on the condition of the engine, and send it to you, I presume, or to whoever called him to the school.\n\nFather Rusaux also said that he had prepared, or was preparing, a requisition for a new engine, to which I replied: \"Send it to your Agent, Mr. Webb.\" I presume he has already done so. However, I have nothing on file here as yet, but may be that in classifying this matter you did not classify same as buildings - repairs (Reference Department's Circular Letter No. C.154, May 17th, 1937), and you have already placed the matter before the department? If so, I would ask you to kindly send me copies of all correspondence in this connection, for my file, including the mechanic's report. If you have not received this report, I would ask you to obtain same at once.\n\nI am forwarding a copy of this letter to the Reverend Principal.\n\nYours truly,\n\nC. Fant.

Today the engine has broken down, and I have had to get the repair man down from Calgary to work on it. Last week I had to send out the spare magneto for the engine, the valves burn out, seats have to be renewed (this is a machine shop job) and now they cannot get the engine to charge the batteries, and have no lights, and have to crank the engine to start it. It will be noted that the engine has been in steady use since the school was erected approximately 15 years ago.\n\nWill you please have this matter taken up with the Department at once, school will re-assemble soon & they cannot operate without an engine in good working order.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

Webb,\nIndian Agent,\nBROCKET, Alta.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to, hereby, formally apply for a new engine, for the electric plant at the Sacred Heart School, Brocket, Alta.\n\nFor the past two or three years, we have experienced all kind of trouble with the actual engine, being for days at a time without light and water. Everything has been done to prolong its life; it was sent to the shop at Calgary to be overhauled; Experts were sent to repair it, and once more it refuses to work, and just when the pupils are coming back to school to begin a new year.\n\nThe verdict of the last experts of the Bruce Robinson Co., Calgary, who worked on it, is that it is useless to have it sent any more to the shop, as it is worn out and finished. No one should be surprised that this engine has come to the end of its life, after 13 years of almost continual running, to generate electricity, pump water and do laundry work.\n\nMay I be allowed to suggest, that an engine of Canadian make be supplied, a Diesel-Fairbanks, if possible; the reasons for this are obvious.\n\nHoping that this request, will be given a favourable reception, I remain,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n(Sgd.) \"E. RUAUX,\" O.M.I.,\nPrincipal.\nMr. C. P. Schmidt  \nDepartment of Indian Affairs  \nPublic Building  \nCalgary, Alta.\n\nDear Mr. Schmidt:\n\nThe writer was recently in Brocket and made an inspection of the engines at the Indian Schools.\n\nThe engine at the Sacred Heart School is in rather bad shape and probably will not run the season without a complete overhauling; however, the expense involved in putting this engine in a condition which would guarantee the degree of reliability necessary for this case, would, in our opinion be prohibitive, and the amount of money involved would be far better spent if invested in a new engine.\n\nWith regard to the engine at the St. Cyprian School, - this one is in a much better condition and will probably run satisfactorily for the present season without any further expense.\n\nHowever, in each case we do not consider it advisable to do any extensive repairing, as it is virtually impossible for us to guarantee trouble-free service on engines which have reached the age of these two. Consequently we would recommend the provision of a new engine at the Sacred Heart School at once, and at the St. Cyprian School possibly next year.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nBRUCE ROBINSON ELECTRIC LIMITED.\n\nP. Kelley, Service Department\nMEMORANDUM\n\nSeptember 2nd, 1939.\n\nMr. F. Kelly, Service Department, Bruce Robinson Electric Co., Ltd., Calgary, says he would recommend as replacement at both Sacred Heart and St. Cyprian's Residential Schools, Peigan Agency, Lister Diesel No. 10-2 engines. These could be \"direct connected\" to the generators now in use, whereas by installing another make of engine, it would probably be necessary to drive the generator with a belt.\n\nBruce Robinson Electric Company, Ltd., are Agents for this make of engine and carry a full line of parts in stock.\nCalgary, September 6th, 1939.\n\nRe: 12 H.P. Lister gasoline engine, Serial H.373 in use at the Sacred Heart (R.C.) Indian Residential School, Peigan Agency.\n\nSir:\n\nReference Department's letter No. 116-1-5 dated July 28th, 1937, addressed to Mr. H. G. Lancaster, Indian Agent, Peigan Agency, Brocket, and Peigan Agency Voucher No. 148, dated October 4th of the same year, for $316.10, in favour of Bruce Robinson Electric Co., Ltd., Calgary, for overhauling the above engine, I have the honour to enclose herewith copies of correspondence and memorandum (Enclosures Nos. 1 to 5, inclusive) relative to the above mentioned engine. These are self-explanatory.\n\nMr. F. Kelly of the Bruce Robinson Electric Co., Ltd., Service Department, when he handed his letter on the P.M. of the 2nd instant, said it was not safe to begin another fall term with this engine, adding, that while he would not call this model obsolete, repair parts for same were not stocked in Calgary, and were hard to get anywhere in Canada.\n\nThis engine is used for lighting, pumping and laundry purposes at the School, and is the only mechanical power unit they have. I would therefore ask that the matter of providing the school with a new engine be given the Department's favourable consideration.\n\nIn my opinion the old engine should have a trade-in value.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC. Pant. Schmidt\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 11, 1939.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 5th instant with reference to replacing the gasoline engine at the Sacred Heart Indian residential school.\n\nIn view of the requirements of the Purchasing Branch it will be necessary for you to give me detailed information regarding the type of engine which you consider should be supplied.\n\nPlease make your explanations as complete as possible stating the catalogue number of the engine which you recommend, the work that it will have to do and any other information that you can obtain.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nC. P. Schmidt, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nCalgary, Alta.\nCalgary, Sept. 19th, 1939.\n\nSir:\n\nReference your No. 116-1-5 of the 11th instant, I beg to advise that Mr. Schmidt is absent from the office on vacation, and will not return until the 26th instant. However, as the matter of purchasing an engine for Sacred Heart School, Peigan Agency, appears to be an urgent one, I got in touch with the Bruce-Robinson Electric, Ltd., Calgary, and asked them for details regarding the engine recommended by them to Mr. Schmidt (Reference Memo attached to our letter, even number, of the 5th instant).\n\nI beg to forward herewith copy of letter received from that Company, together with pages from catalogue, giving a full description of the engine recommended by them.\n\nIn conversation with Agent Webb, he informed me that the Bruce-Robinson representative, Mr. Kelley, had described this engine to him when at the school, and that it appeared to be quite suitable.\n\nThe engine is required for lighting, pumping water, and laundry purposes.\n\nI trust this is the information required in this connection. If any details have been omitted, please advise. I will bring the matter to Mr. Schmidt's attention immediately upon his return to the office.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC.

Daly of the Bruce-Robinson Electric Co. examined the engine on September 2 and stated that it was not safe to begin another term with it as while he would not call the model obsolete, spare parts for same were not stocked in Calgary and were hard to get anywhere in Canada. The principal requests a Lister diesel engine and I enclose a quotation received from Bruce-Robinson Electric Company, Calgary, also a folder giving complete details of the engine requested.\n\nIt is evident from the information received from the Inspector of Indian Agencies that this engine is required at the earliest possible date in order that the lighting, pumping and laundry services of the school will not be jeopardized.\n\nI hereby certify that I have personal knowledge that all the above articles are required in the Department and for Departmental purposes only.

The Department is somewhat at a loss to know why the Principals of our residential schools wait until the schools are ready to open to carry on the interior painting.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. T.W.V. Webb,\nIndian Agent,\nBrocket, Alta.\nPeigan Indian Agency, Brocket, Alberta No. 116.\n\nSeptember 2nd, 1941.\n\nSir,\n\nI have a request from the Principal of the Sacred Heart Indian Residential School on this Reserve, to ask the Department for permission to construct an addition to the existing school building, sized 40 ft x 60 ft on the west end, this to be built by the Society of the Oblate Fathers, at their own expense, without any cost to the Department.\n\nIt is intended to use this new part as quarters for the girls, leaving the present building as for the boys, there will be a semi-basement as a recreation room & bathroom, on the first floor two classrooms, the second floor to use as a girl's dormitory, and the top floor install a chapel & also a sewing room.\n\nFather Rusaux said they do not expect any extra grant, and said the present heating plant would take care of the new project. At present they are drilling a new well at their own expense, to try and augment the supply of water which of late years has been a problem.\n\nWill the Department please let me have early consideration of their request, as they have a lot of material on the ground (brick) and would like to start before the cold weather arrives.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. W. Victor Webb,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nONTARIO, Ontario.\n\nVia Inspector C.P. Schmidt's office.\nSir:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a letter, addressed to the Secretary, by Mr. T.W.V. Webb, Indian Agent, Pelican agency, re building an addition to Sacred Heart Indian Residential School at Brocket.\n\nThis matter was mentioned to me this Summer by Rev. E. Riaux, the Principal, who stated that it was the intention of the Oblate Order to build an addition in the near future, and that he was gathering material, buying when he had a chance to get something cheap, and that he had purchased a quantity of second-class fire brick from someone West of Brocket on the Crow's head river railway. I saw some of these, and they appeared to be in very good condition.\n\nI asked the Principal not to start any work before informing the Department and getting authority; I also suggested that he submit a plan and sketch, and pointed out to him that the heating would be an important matter to consider, as he mentioned a separate building with four outside walls, to be connected to the present building by passages only.\n\nI also mentioned the very important matter of getting an ample supply of water, because as the Department know, the supply of water from the original well was insufficient. A spring nearby was tapped to increase this supply, but with little success, as we barely have enough for household purposes; there are times when the supply is very limited, and flushing generally is not done as freely as it should be. An attempt to sink another well was made, a few hundred yards South of the buildings was made, and given up, no water being found. Another -- a third -- well was sunk a few feet from the original well, near the buildings: water was found here at the same level as in the original well, but I am told that this did not increase the supply; it would appear that pumping one affected the other. As regards fire protection, I am not satisfied with what we have.\n\nWe must expect, that with extra space (accommodation), more children of which there is a large number on the Reserve -- will be accepted in this School.\n\nMy recommendation is, that before giving their approval, the Department have one of the Engineer-Architects of the Parks Branch, from either Waterton or Banff, call at the school, look over the plans and location, and give special attention to heating and water supply, and fire protection.\n\nIt will be noted that Mr. Webb says they are at present drilling a new well at their own expense. If water is found, I would strongly recommend that a proper test of the capacity of the supply be made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC. Pant. Schmidt,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa,\nSeptember 18, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 9th instant with reference to the proposal of the Principal of the Sacred Heart Residential School to erect an addition to the building.\n\nAs you are aware, construction of all Government buildings has been discontinued with the exception of those required for war purposes.\n\nIn your letter you point out the many difficulties that might arise if the Principal proceeded with the erection of the proposed addition. Very careful consideration has been given to the contents of your letter and it has been decided that we cannot view favourably the erection of any addition to a Government-owned school by the Church authorities. You should so inform the Rev. Principal.\n\nMay I add that in view of the limited amount at our disposal for the payment of per capita allowances it would not be possible to increase the pupilage at the Sacred Heart School even though additional accommodation were available.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. C.F.

Ind. School.\n\nFather Ruaux has been having considerable trouble with the water well at his school, for the last two weeks. He was able to connect onto a spring which so far is supplying enough water to get along with. I understand though that this supply is none too reliable.\n\nFather Ruaux was afraid at first that the water supply in the well was gone but that proved to be incorrect. He pulled part of the casing and found that the third length of pump rod down was broken. This he repaired himself and thought his well was alright.\n\nHe phoned in today and said they still could not get water and had discovered that the 9th rod down is also broken. He has not the proper equipment to work with for this job and asked that we get the department to take care of it.\n\nThis well is over 300 feet deep and the pump cylinder is down 300 feet, this means quite a job of lifting and holding the casing.\n\nMr. Webb, the agent is on sick leave. I phoned the Inspector and he is out of the city.\n\nI got in touch with Mr. S. Pearson, Pincher Creek, who has worked at this well on previous occasions and asked him to give me an approximate cost of putting in new pipe rods where necessary and he informed me that the cost would likely run between $75.00 and $100.00.\n\nWill the department kindly wire me authority to have Mr. Pearson get this well in working order?\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Canada.\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.B.

Other possible sources of water supply have also been investigated. Briefly these are:\n\nWell No. 1 - This was the first well drilled and by 1937 the water supply from it was inadequate. It is close beside the school. Originally drilled to a depth of 300 ft., it was cleaned out and drilled a further 30 ft. in grey shale in November 1937. Little improvement was effected thereby. The volume of water that could be obtained from it was 600 gallons per day. This well is said now to produce only about 200 gallons per day.\n\nWell No. 2 - This well, the second, is situated about 1,000 ft. south of the school on a small hill. It was drilled in March 1938 to a depth of 350 ft., but when its capacity was found to be only about 20 gallons per hour, the casing was pulled immediately.\n\n(over) ......\nWell No. 3 - This, the third well, is situated about 10 ft. south of well No. 1. It was drilled in September 1938 to a depth of 295 ft. but its capacity was found to be somewhat less than that of well No. 1 and it apparently has not been in use although the casing was left in it.\n\nWell No. 4 - This, the fourth well, is situated about 100 ft. south of well No. 2. It is not known just when it was drilled. We are advised that it was drilled to a depth of 100 ft. and no water being found, was abandoned.\n\nNo. 5, Developed Spring - This Spring issues from a rock face at the head of a small coulee, about 1000 ft. east of the school. The water is collected in a concrete tank which has been constructed there and is apparently being pumped to the school. The amount of water available varies with precipitation conditions. It is possible also that water gets into this tank by seeping back from the pond in front of the tank. This pond has been formed by a dam having been built across the coulee 100 yards north of the spring. Surface run-off water collects in this pond; at times when the spring is flowing freely the concrete tank may overflow into the pond. In September last about 500 gallons per day could be obtained from this concrete tank.\n\nWell No. 6 - This is Neil Yellow Wing's well. It is situated about 1/2 mile southwest of the school and apparently was drilled to a depth of 70 ft. On a test made in October last the capacity of this well was only 42 gallons per hour. From experience with other wells, it is probable that if it were kept pumped dry for a considerable period its capacity would be much less.\n\nNo. 7 - Springs said to exist at one time in the vicinity, have since dried up.\n\nNorth of the school the ground falls away in a long gentle slope with no sharp break to indicate a site where it would seem more likely that water would be found than at the\npoints where the wells referred to have been drilled.\n\nThe foregoing would not seem to justify any hope that an adequate water supply can be secured from springs, or from wells to a depth of 500 ft., under all conditions of precipitation, nor is there anything to indicate that sufficient water would be obtained from deeper wells. However, in view of the large investment in the school we have had a preliminary estimate prepared of the cost of a 600 ft. well. The drilling and casing of an entirely new 600 ft. well would be about $3800.00; to deepen well No. 3 to 600 ft. would cost about $2200.00. In either case if an adequate water supply were found the additional cost of installing a suitable pump might be to the order of $1500.00.\n\nIt is our opinion that any further expenditure on well drilling will be a gamble; that the odds are heavily against any adequate water supply being found and only the heavy investment in the school buildings warrants it even being considered.\n\nWe understand that water is now being brought by truck from Brocket to augment the present insufficient supply at the school. We would suggest that this arrangement be continued for a time to see if precipitation conditions will not improve sufficiently to afford an adequate supply from the existing well and spring.\n\nDirector.\nAIR MAIL\n\nOttawa, November 12, 1943.\n\nMr. C. P. Schmidt, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nCalgary, Alberta.\n\nI am sending forward herewith copy of a report on the water supply at the Sacred Heart Indian Residential School, received by this Branch from the Surveys and Engineering Branch. The subject matter of this report, you will note, is self-explanatory.\n\nIn view of the serious condition existing at this school, resulting from an inadequate water supply, it is just possible that you may deem it advisable to visit the school at an early date.\n\nThe subject matter of the memorandum received from the Surveys and Engineering Branch has been very carefully considered by the officials here. In our judgment there is not even a remote possibility of securing the funds necessary to undertake the drilling of one or more of the wells to a depth of 600 ft. The estimates for the fiscal year 1944-45 have already been prepared and approved at the Minister's office. In these estimates no provision whatever has been made for an expenditure such as this at Sacred Heart.\n\nWhen considering the operation of this school, a number of suggestions will naturally occur to you. In your last report on this school you intimated that there were 14 milch cows at the institution and that 10 were being milked at the time of your visit. In addition to these cows, you also listed 26 head of other cattle, 6 work horses and one colt, 2 saddle horses and 85 hogs. I have been wondering if it is at all necessary to maintain such a large number of cattle at this school.\n\nMr. Doucet, you may remember, made an educational survey of this reserve in the year 1942, and\nsince that time the Principal has suggested to the Department that the boys might be provided with education at the institution on a day school basis. We are anxious to know if, in your judgment, it would be at all practicable to operate this institution as an Indian day school or improved day school, making provision for the transportation of the pupils now in attendance and on the understanding that a hot lunch or noonday meal would be provided at the school. In this way the members of the staff, who now number approximately 16, might be substantially reduced and practically all the cattle disposed of. It is just possible that an arrangement somewhat similar to this may have to be worked out in connection with a number of our residential schools in the immediate future. If you and the Principal are of the opinion that it would be scarcely feasible to operate the institution as an Indian day school, what other means might be adopted to conserve the available water supply\u2014a supply that may be still further reduced at any time. In making this investigation it might prove helpful to you and to the Principal to consult the public school inspector for the district.\n\nI am sending a copy of this correspondence to the Reverend H. Routhier, O.M.I., Provincial of the Oblate Order, Edmonton, Alta., for his information.\n\nEncl.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nCopy sent to Rev. H. Routhier, O.M.I.,\nOblate Fathers' Provincial House,\n9816 - 110th St., Edmonton, Alta.\nREPORT ON THE INSPECTION OF THE DIESEL LIGHTING PLANT AT SACRED HEART SCHOOL.\n\nSeptember 21st. The Diesel at this point was in very bad shape and shows signs of neglect. I was told that the cylinder heads had not been removed since the engine was installed, and the valves were badly burned and a heavy carbon deposit almost closed the exhaust and air intake ports on the cylinder heads.\n\nThe batteries should be changed from their present location to a more suitable place. Where they are installed now they are subject to a lot of dust, dirt and moisture. I understand that the pump which is now in use occasionally blows out the packing and water is sprayed on the batteries as a result.\n\nI also checked an open circuit on #5 circuit and found it is a job for an inside wire man as it runs between the walls.\n\nI would recommend that a competent wire man check this short circuiting.\n\nThis Diesel should also be checked over once every 6 months the same as the one at St. Cyprian School.\n\n(Sgd.) \"JOHN A.

Sir:\n\nEX'D\n\nI am enclosing herewith copy of the report submitted by the mechanic from Bruce Robinson Electric, Ltd., Calgary, who checked and repaired the Diesel engine at your school in September, last. I wish to draw your particular attention to the first paragraph of this report, which reflects on the mechanic employed at your school.\n\nAs regards the changing of the batteries from their present location, I have on one or two occasions when at the school, remarked that these should be placed in a different room, and I suggested a long, narrow room across the corridor from the laundry, which has one medium-sized outside window only, if it were possible to utilize this room for this purpose. I also remarked that one wall of this room could be used for storing accessories and hanging hand tools. I do not think that it would require an expert to make this change; your mechanic should be able to do this work.\n\nAs regards the open circuit on No. 6 Circuit; I would suggest that you talk this matter over with Mr. Faunt, the Indian Agent, and others who understand this sort of thing; it might be possible that you arrange to have someone who does this class of work call at the school on a visit, and give you advice as to how to go about it to remedy this defect. If it is a case of having to engage special tradesmen to do so, the matter will have to be placed before the Department and authority obtained first, before incurring the expenditure. This open circuit was not mentioned to me before; yet I presume there must be some lights that do not work.\n\nI wish it understood, that we are aware that you have not been in charge, and have not lived at this school, before September of this year.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev.

Hunt\nEdmonton, December 15, 1943\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have come down to the Sacred Heart School at Brockat, to study, in company with Mr. O. D. Bush, a well driller with rotary equipment (address: 231, 8th Avenue West, Calgary, Alberta), the question of drilling a well for the needs of the School.\n\nThe problem is critical and urgent of solution, as the School has had to haul water a distance of 5 miles, getting water from the C.P.R. at Brockat, in a 1000 gallon tank at least three times a day, and this does not really suffice for the needs of the School, especially when washing has to be done. No one can contemplate that this must become a permanent situation, all the more so that the C.P.R. Superintendent has notified the Principal of the School that this can only be a temporary arrangement. Owing to replacements being made these days at the C.P.R. reservoir at Brockat, the water is being hauled from Pincher Creek, a distance of 16 miles. One hates to think of the situation if a fire were to break out. This hauling of water has been going on since the 7th of November, and no relief seems to be forthcoming from Ottawa, at least not to my knowledge.\n\nI would therefore request that the Oblate Fathers be authorized to hire a well driller as soon as possible to drill at the School to a depth of at least 700 feet if needs be. In the past, two wells at least were dug to a depth of 300 or a little more but in neither case have they found more than surface water. Mr. Bush offers to drill a well with a rotary equipment at a cost of $4.50 per foot, and the cost of the casing would be approximately $1.35 per foot. We are anxious that the work start as soon as possible, that is, not later than the 3rd of January, at which date Mr. Bush would be ready to start. The Oblate Fathers are ready to advance the money to start the work immediately and I do ask that there be no delay in giving an answer to my urgent request either by telegram or air mail to Edmonton.\n\nYours truly,\n\nH.

At that time you might feel it advisable to mention the name of Mr. Bush, who apparently is equipped for drilling wells.\n\nActing Director.\n| DATE | SERVICE                                                                 | AMOUNT |\n|------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Dec 31 | To Grant towards salary for Night Watchman at the Sacred Heart Indian Res.

Hunt\nOttawa,\nDecember 18, 1943.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nDear Father Routhier:\n\nYour letter of December 15 reached me this morning and I had Mr. Phelan go to the Surveys & Engineering Branch with a view to interviewing these officials regarding the digging of another well as suggested in your letter.\n\nI am informed that Mr. Hoover was written about the 10th or 11th instant and asked for a further report. This has not yet reached the Surveys & Engineering Branch, but they are telegraphing Mr. Hoover again asking him to rush his report and at the same time they are advising him regarding Mr. Bush whom you mention in your letter.\n\nI feel that we cannot take any action until we receive Mr. Hoover's report and the contents of it is carefully studied by the officials of the Surveys & Engineering Branch.\n\nAs you realize, the digging of a new well will probably involve a cost between $5000.00 and $6000.00 and, judging by previous experience, we have no assurance that water will be obtained in an adequate quantity. In other words, it is a pure gamble. I am advised that competent engineers have determined that the water level of the Old Man River is 256 feet. Consequently when a well is drilled below this point it would appear that there is not much seepage from the river mentioned. All the wells, I believe, at the Sacred Heart School are below this depth and yet water has not been obtained in sufficient quantities.\n\nThere is another alternative that might be considered; namely, deepening the No. 3 well. Our\n\nRev. H. Routhier, O.M.I.,\n9916 - 110th St.,\nEdmonton, Alta.\ninformation is that this was dug to a depth of 300 feet and that the casing is still in it. To deepen this well another 200 or 300 feet would involve less cost and possibly we would have just as much chance of striking water as in digging a new well.\n\nI thought you would like to have all the above information, as the engineers of the Surveys & Engineering Branch have been interested in securing water at this school for several years past. I can assure you that as soon as Mr. Hoover's report is received I will write to you again.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Hoey,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDecember 20, 1943\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nMy sincere thanks for your prompt reply to my letter of the 18th. I shall await the next one following the engineer's report, as you understand that I am extremely anxious to have something done.\n\nI had thought that it would save considerably if the well that has been dug to a depth of 25 feet and in which the casing still remains, Mr. Bush thinks that it would be hard to dig in this casing which is five and five-eighths inches in diameter at the surface and five inches lower down. Of course I am no judge in this matter. I am told that at the Anglican school which is four miles away from the Sacred Heart School, there is always an abundance of water however dry the season may be. I am praying that the same may be found for the school.\n\nMy best wishes to you, Mr. Phelan and Mr. Doucet for Xmas and the New Year.\n\nGratefully,\n\nHenri Routhier O.M.I., Prov.\nOttawa,\nDecember 31, 1943.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nRe: Water Supply, Sacred Heart Indian Residential School, Brocket, Alberta.\n\nThe water supply at this school has again given out and it is necessary, as a temporary expedient, to haul water from the C.P.R. locomotive supply tank at Brocket, a distance of five miles.\n\nThe lack of water at this school has been a constant source of trouble for several years and the matter has been considered on several occasions by the field officers of the Surveys and Engineering Branch.\n\nThe Sacred Heart Residential School was erected in the fiscal year 1926-27 at an approximate cost of $60,000.00. It has an authorized pupilage of 50. A report just received from Inspector Schmidt indicates that the population of the Peigan Band has increased in the last sixteen years from 382 to 551. The school population has increased in accordance with the total population. In 1942 Mr. Doucet carefully surveyed this reserve in order to ascertain if day schools were feasible. At that time he expressed the opinion that the Indians are not living sufficiently close together to enable the children to attend day schools. A report from Inspector Schmidt dated November 24, 1943, expresses the opinion that the operation of a day school would not be practical.\n\nFor your information I enclose the last report submitted to this Branch by the Surveys & Engineering Branch. We realize that it is purely a gamble whether we can secure water, but, on the other hand, we also feel\nthat the school must be kept in operation, if at all possible, and to do so a water supply is necessary.\n\nI, therefore, recommend that we accept the suggestion made by the Surveys & Engineering Branch; namely, either drill a new well or deepen the present well known as No. 5. If water is not found by the time a depth of 600 feet is reached it is understood that the field officers of the Surveys & Engineering Branch will report back for further instructions. The expenditure involved will vary from $2,200.00 to $3,800.00. Funds to the amount stated are available in the appropriation for the current fiscal year and I feel that authority should be issued immediately to proceed with the work.\n\nActing Director.\n\nPP\ncase and we have no reason to believe that such a supply exists in this area.\n\n\"In this connection, Mr. W. Maughan of the Union Drilling Co., Calgary, and the brother of J. Maughan, stated that they had employed a rotary outfit on water well drilling at one time but had discontinued the practice and sold the rotary equipment because it had not been satisfactory for the reasons as outlined.\"\n\nIt will be recalled that in our memorandum of November 9th last we advised that the drilling and casing of an entirely new 600-foot well, the drilling to be done by the regular churn or cable tool method, would be about $3800 or to deepen well No. 3 to 600 feet would cost about $2200.\n\nIn view of Mr. Hoover's report and the great expense that would be involved, we are not in favour of rotary drilling. We would recommend therefore that we be authorized to instruct Mr. Hoover to draw up an agreement, to be signed by a reputable well driller, providing for the \"filling of a 600-foot well by the churn or cable tool method. This agreement should include a provision that the decision as to whether well No. 3 should be deepened to 600 feet or whether an entirely new well should be drilled should be left to be agreed upon by Mr. Hoover and the driller after examination of well No. 3, whether its casing is free, the condition of the casing etc.\n\nAfter the well reached a depth of 600 feet, and if no water has been found, a report should be submitted with an estimate of cost of drilling an additional 200 feet, when a decision can be made as to whether any further drilling should be done.\n\nIn view of the opinions expressed in previous correspondence over a number of years regarding this matter, it need hardly be added that we are not optimistic about a water supply adequate to the needs of the school being found at a depth of even 600 or 800 feet. The existing circumstances and the heavy investment in the school buildings may however, warrant one more effort being made to secure a well with an adequate supply.\n\n(Sgd.) J.M. Wardle,\nDirector.\nSurveys and Engineering Branch\n\nOttawa, December 26th, 1943.\n\nDr. McGill Re: Water Supply, Sacred Heart Indian Residential School, Brocket, Alberta.\n\nIn reply to your memoranda of December 3rd and December 18th relative to the above, this matter has been the subject of further correspondence with our Engineering and Construction Service and Mr. Hoover.\n\nMr. Hoover had been in touch with drilling contractors in Calgary and sent in his report airmail on December 21st, the day he was wired regarding the matter. He had been advised that the cost of an 800-foot rotary drilled well, including drilling, casing, moving equipment to Brocket, testing, etc., would be from $7,000 to $10,000.\n\nIn connection with rotary drilling for water, Mr. Hoover states as follows:\n\n\"Aside from the difficulty in obtaining a rotary outfit and the expense involved, it is our opinion that the use of rotary drilling for water wells is impractical unless the objective is a known water-bearing horizon, which condition does not obtain in this case. As the hole is full of drilling fluid (which about 11 lbs. per gallon) at all times during the drilling operations, the presence of water cannot be determined unless a string of casing is run and the hole pumped out. Examination of cuttings from the well gives the only clue to possible water bearing horizons, and several strings of casing might be run without success. Also, there is the added danger of 'mudding off' producing horizons. That is, when the bit enters a horizon carrying water at a pressure less than the head of drilling fluid in the hole, the drilling mud is forced into the formation.

I was sure that you were dealing with the matter, but I simply wanted to let you know what the actual situation is.\n\nWe are still hauling water from the C.P.R. station at Brocket, and we manage to get enough for the essential needs of the School, but should the weather change, and snow come, and we cannot expect the weather to remain as fine as it has been so far, it will be an awful job to keep us provided with enough water to go on with the number of children that we have.\n\nThis is the only reason why I am so anxious to see the problem solved soon.

George Crepeau, O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, December 28th, 1943.\n\nDr. McGill\n\nRe: Water Supply, Sacred Heart Indian Residential School, Brocket, Alberta.\n\nIn reply to your memoranda of December 3rd and December 18th relative to the above, this matter has been the subject of further correspondence with our Engineering and Construction Service and Mr. Hoover.\n\nMr. Hoover had been in touch with drilling contractors in Calgary and sent in his report airmail on December 21st, the day he was wired regarding the matter. He had been advised that the cost of an 800-foot rotary drilled well, including drilling, casing, moving equipment to Brocket, testing, etc., would be from $7,000 to $10,000.\n\nIn connection with rotary drilling for water, Mr. Hoover states as follows:\n\n\"Aside from the difficulty in obtaining a rotary outfit and the expense involved, it is our opinion that the use of rotary drilling for water wells is impractical unless the objective is a known water-bearing horizon, which condition does not obtain in this case. As the hole is full of drilling fluid (weight about 11 lbs. per gallon) at all times during the drilling operations, the presence of water cannot be determined unless a string of casing is run and the hole pumped out. Examination of cuttings from the well gives the only clue to possible water bearing horizons, and several strings of casing might be run without success. Also, there is the added danger of 'mudding off'...\"\n\"producing horizons. That is, when the bit enters a horizon carrying water at a pressure less than the head of drilling fluid in the hole, the drilling mud is forced into the formation. When a point of equilibrium is established the suspended particles in the drilling mud may be deposited and seal off the horizon. These objections, of course, do not apply if an artesian supply is encountered with sufficient pressure to lift the drilling mud from the hole. However, this is a particular case and we have no reason to believe that such a supply exists in this area.\n\n\"In this connection, Mr. W. Maughan of the Union Drilling Co., Calgary, and the brother of J. Maughan, stated that they had employed a rotary outfit on water well drilling at one time but had discontinued the practice and sold the rotary equipment because it had not been satisfactory for the reasons as outlined.\"\n\nIt will be recalled that in our memorandum of November 9th last we advised that the drilling and casing of an entirely new 600-foot well, the drilling to be done by the regular churn or cable tool method, would be about $3800 or to deepen well No. 3 to 800 feet would cost about $2200.\n\nIn view of Mr. Hoover's report and the great expense that would be involved, we are not in favour of rotary drilling. We would recommend therefore that we be authorized to instruct Mr. Hoover to draw up an agreement, to be signed by a reputable well driller, providing for the drilling of a 600-foot well by the churn or cable tool method. This agreement should include a provision that the decision as to whether well No. 3 should be deepened to 800 feet or whether an entirely new well should be drilled should be left to be agreed upon by Mr. Hoover and the driller after examination of well No. 3, whether its casing is free, the condition of the casing etc.\n\nAfter the well reached a depth of 800 feet, and if no water has been found, a report should be submitted with an estimate of cost of drilling an additional 200 feet; when a decision can be made as to whether any further drilling should be done.\nIn view of the opinions expressed in previous correspondence over a number of years regarding this matter, it need hardly be added that we are not optimistic about a water supply adequate to the needs of the school being found at a depth of even 600 or 800 feet. The existing circumstances and the heavy investment in the school buildings may however, warrant one more effort being made to secure a well with an adequate supply.\n\nJ. M.

Funds to the amount stated are available in the appropriation for the current fiscal year and I feel that authority should be issued immediately to proceed with the work.\n\nActing Director.\n\nPP\nSacred Heart school appears to be due to the difference in the dip of the underlying bedrock at those two locations, as indicated by the change in the dip and strike symbols on the map. Sacred Heart school well is located near to or on the east limb of a small structural trough in which any water that would be derived from the higher ground to the west or southwest migrated along the contact of the Foothills and underlying impermeous formation would be trapped and would accumulate under hydrostatic pressure and thus be available to produce an adequate supply when tapped by wells. The wells at Sacred Heart school, on the other hand, are located on the north side of a small anticline in the field near the crest where there is little, if any, rock-water bed near the crest where there would be little, if any, rock-water bed near the crest where there would penetrate along the contact of the Foothills and underlying impermeous formations. It is possible that it is this formation that gives rise to the spring east southwest of the school site about one thousand feet southeast of the school site point. That the three wells drilled penetrated the council face of entering water, there appears to be little chance of an adequate supply in the immediate underlying formation.\n\nThe underlying Willow Creek formation consists largely of soft red and variegated shales with minor amounts of red and grey sands, and some shales. The thickness of this formation is estimated to be approximately 1000 feet. Oldman River has cut its channel about 200 feet below the top of the formation and therefore, because of the river valley may seep into it laterally, but owing to the shaly and impervious nature of this formation that will be relatively small.\n\nUnderlying the Willow Creek formation is the St. Mary River formation or Upper Greyshale. It consists largely of alternating series of hard limestone and thick shale and thin sandstone with soft grey shales and sandstones. It has an estimated thickness of approximately 2600 feet. The sandstone horizons are much more porous, thicker and more extensive than any one of the overlying Willow Creek formation and the possibilities their containing adequate water supplies have been shown in the structure section E-P; the formations form a pronounced trough with the outcrops, except along the rim of the basin to the east, south and west lying at a considerably higher elevation than they do in the centre of the syncline. However, the higher outcrop belt in the Foothills area is crossed by many streams providing abundant water for any reservoir beds. Water entering to the region from these outcrops will find its way toward the syncline axis and will be forced by the hydrostatic tendency to rise as high in the formation as possible. It appears likely therefore that a good water-bearing horizon such as the top at or near the top of the St. Mary River formation might be used as a source of water will be stopped by the upward movement of the water if such a horizon is considered before any other water-bearing horizon is penetrated by a well. Such a layer appearing excellent that a good stratum water might be encountered, or at least the water will rise within the surface at the Sacred Heart school site. Any water tapped this horizon should be fresh and suitable for domestic purposes.\n\nIt appears, therefore, that to tap an adequate supply source for Sacred Heart school it will be necessary to drill to a depth not exceeding of feet. It is possible that satisfactory water might be encountered at a shallower depth, but the additional pressure in the uppermost beds of the St. Mary River formation may cause the water to be warrantless.\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nE.H.

Mines and Resources,\n500 Booth Building,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nAs requested by\nMr. A.J. Doucet I am sending\nyou herewith a copy of memorandum\nand accompanying maps and\nstructure section sheet sent to Mr.\nJ.A. Poulsen today. A copy of this has also\nbeen sent to Mr. W.C. Bethune as requested.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nP.R. MacKay.\nJanuary 13th, 1944.\n\nDr. McGill:\n\nRe: Water Supply, Sacred Heart Indian Residential School, Peigan Indian Reserve, Brocket, Alberta.\n\nThis will confirm statements made in the course of our discussion in your office today, relative to the above, and with particular reference to the information and recommendations contained in the memorandum to me from Dr. B.R. MacKay, Geologist in charge, Ground Water and Boring Section, Mines and Geology Branch, dated January 8th, of which you were sent a copy.\n\nIn this connection I may say that our previous advice not to drill wells at this school much deeper than 300 feet was based upon the advice of Dr. MacKay's predecessor Mr. W.A. Johnston. The ground surface at this school is about 252 feet above the water surface of the Old Man river at its nearest point, and the bottoms of the several 300 foot wells at the school are therefore below the surface of the river.\n\nIn his memorandum Dr. MacKay explains the subsurface geological formations adjacent to the Peigan Indian Reserve in considerable detail. He also explains why a good supply of water is probably to be found in the St. Mary river formation at the location of this school, at a depth of 1200 feet, but not in formations at shallower depths.\n\nIn view of Dr. MacKay's statements, and of the fact that there seems to be no other source from which it is practicable to secure a supply of water suitable for and adequate to the needs of this school, we would recommend that a well be drilled with a rotary drilling gear to a depth of approximately 1200 feet, into the uppermost beds of the St. Mary river formation, provided it is considered that the general policy with regard to the future operation of Indian schools on this reserve warrants the expense that will be involved.\n\n(over)\nWhile we have no definite estimates on the cost of a 1200 foot well it seems probable from figures that have been quoted for a 800 foot well that it would be from $10,000 to $13,000. We recommend a well drilled by means of a rotary drilling gear rather than by churn drilling, because the latter is not so suitable for deep wells. Two drillers in that area, who operate churn drilling equipment, were consulted recently and they would not undertake a well deeper than 300 feet. Mr. Joe Maughan, who has drilled the existing wells at the school with similar equipment, was unwilling to draw up an original contract for a well deeper than 600 feet. If a well was carried to that depth he would be willing to consider further drilling to perhaps 800 feet at a price to be mutually agreed upon providing the hole and his equipment were in shape to do so.\n\nIn our memorandum of December 28th last, we stated objections to rotary drilling for a shallower well then under consideration. These objections do not apply in the case of this proposed 1200 foot well for the following reasons: First, the objective is what is assumed to be a known water-bearing formation. Second, in this instance there would seem to be no danger of \"mudding off\" since as Dr. MacKay claims, the well will be of an artesian nature (he expects the water would rise to within 100 feet of the surface of the ground). This could result only from considerable pressure into the hole from the water-bearing formation at the 1200 foot level which would prevent the mud sealing off the water supply.\n\nIn addition to probably providing a water supply for the school, satisfactory in all respects, the drilling of such a well would provide geological information and information regarding the possibilities of water supply, which would be of much general value for the area adjacent to the school.\n\nThere is, of course, the possibility that a satisfactory supply may be reached before the well reaches a depth of 1200 feet, in which case it would be unnecessary to drill deeper than the level at which the water supply was reached.\n\nIt seems unlikely, however, that such a supply will be reached at any lesser depth than 1200 feet.\nWe cannot express an opinion at this time as to whether one of the existing wells could be made use of for the proposed new well. It would probably be necessary to pull the casing now in place and this might prove to be impossible. Moreover the size of the existing wells, under six inches, might be too small for a 1200 foot well. Experienced drillers can be consulted however on this point if it is decided to proceed with the 1200 foot well.\n\nIf it is decided, in view of all the circumstances that the expense of drilling such a well is warranted, we shall be glad to secure more definite information as to costs etc., and to make arrangements for the drilling and to supervise the work.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 21, 1944.\n\nEX'D.\nA.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nRe: Water Supply, Sacred Heart Indian Residential School, Brocket, Alberta.\n\nI desire to refer to our memorandum to you dated December 3, 1943.\n\nIn this connection I am sending forward herewith copy of a report received from the Director of the Surveys & Engineering Branch.\n\nDirector.\n\nRAH\nCOPY\n\nCANADIAN NATIONAL TELEGRAM\n\n1944 J.N 25 PM 902\n\nRA595 45 NL-EDMONTON ALTA 25\n\nHONORABLE T CHERAR= MINISTER OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nOTTAWA ONT-\n\nSUPPLY OF WATER AT BROCKET FROM WHICH SACRED HEART SCHOOL\nOBTAINED ITS WATER LATELY RUNNING LOW STOP POSSIBLY CPR\nWILL REFUSE GIVE MORE SHORTLY STOP SCHOOL WOULD THEN HAVE\nTO GO TO PINCHERCREEK EIGHTEEN MILES AWAY STOP KINDLY\nHASTEN BY ALL MEANS DRILLING OF WELL-\n\nHENRI ROUTHIER OM I PROVINCIAL\nMinister's Office\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\n26th January, 1944.\n\nDeputy Minister,\n\nI understand the Indian Affairs Branch has been going into the matter of providing more adequate water supply for the Roman Catholic residential school near Brocket or of making some other arrangement for education on the reserve.

Routhier, O.M.I., regarding the water supply at the Sacred Heart Indian Residential School on the Peigan Reserve near Brocket, Alberta.\n\nIn this connection I would refer you to my memorandum of January 21 enclosing copy of a report received from the Director of the Surveys & Engineering Branch, also copy of a report from Doctor R.B. MacKay of the Geological Survey Branch. These two reports outline very completely the possibility of securing the water which must be obtained if the residential school is to be kept in operation.\n\nOfficials of this Branch have carefully considered the possibility of making other arrangements for education on the Peigan Reserve. One of the officials of this Branch made a very complete survey of the reserve in 1942 and it was his definite opinion that the residential school should be continued in operation. His opinion in this regard is further supported by a report received from Inspector Schmidt dated November 24, 1943. I enclose this report and respectfully direct your attention to the paragraph on Page 2 reading as follows:\n\n\"The time has not yet arrived, nor are conditions -- financially, materially and otherwise -- such in this Agency that I could recommend the improved day school system for both boys and girls of this Agency.\"\nIt is also interesting to note from other parts of the report the great scarcity of good drinking water on this reserve. If such is the case, the boring of a well equal in depth to the one now proposed by Doctor N.B. MacKay will have to be undertaken at an early date to meet the needs of the Indians, apart from the water necessary to supply the residential school.\n\nAfter giving the matter very careful consideration it is felt that the only solution of the matter is to follow the advice given by Doctor MacKay and the Surveys & Engineering Branch and proceed at once with the digging of a well, in the hope that an adequate supply of good drinking water, which is so essential, may be secured.\n\nDirector.\nSacred Heart School,\nBrocket, Alberta. Jan. 22, 1944.\n\nMr. J.W. Faunt, Indian Agent,\nIndian Agency, Brocket, Alta.\n\nDear Mr. Faunt:\n\nOn Reverend Father Crepeau's request I wish to submit to your consideration the enlargement of the Bakery which measures 16'4\" x 7'5\". The oven takes 3'6\" x 4'8\", 5' high; the kneading trough 5'6\" x 2' and the racks on which we put the pans to let the bread rise before baking it measure 3'11\" x 1'8\". When four girls stand by to knead the dough the place is so well packed that we cannot even open the door.\n\nLast December the Sister & the girls who were taking care of the Bakery could not stand the work any longer. I took it over myself with a new girl, who in turn cannot stand the intense heat of the room more than an hour or so without nasal hemorrhage. The experience of the past years proves that the concentrated heat of that place together with the lack of ventilation affects everybody's system. Many sisters were requested to fill the position, each of them tried with the same result. One after another they had to be changed and a few of them were ordered complete rest for several months after being on duty for a short period. It seems to me that the situation could be improved by enlarging the room to double its actual dimensions.\n\nI talked the matter over with our engineer who thinks it would be possible to dig the ground, level to the basement, at the back of the Bakery and there we could put the oven with the racks. The kneading trough only would be left in the former room. It would be necessary to build a cement foundation and a roof would be sufficient to cover over the oven. The only window in the room could be used as a door, provided the wall below would be cut down three or four feet lower.\n\nAt present the oven is out of order. It will probably take a few weeks to repair it. Should we not take advantage of this opportunity to enlarge the room also and by this means make it sanitary enough so that the employees may stand the work.\n\nHoping you will take this matter into consideration,\n\nI remain\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nSigned Sister Eva Mariette, Sup.\n\nSeen and approved on January 22, 1944\n\nSigned Rev.

T. Faunt, Acting Indian Agent, Peigan Agency, attached to which is a letter, addressed to him by the Sister Superior of the school, which letter is approved by Rev. George Crepeau, the principal.\n\nThe size of the present bakery room is said to be 18'4\" x 7'3\"; in this room are the kneading troughs, the setting racks and the oven; the room is too small. Therefore, a request is made that it be enlarged to double its actual size by constructing an addition to the present building.\n\nI note, it is said, that the only window in the present room can be converted into a doorway to connect with a new addition. If this is done what natural light will be left in the original room? Also, what ventilation and \"Fresh Air\" will there be?\n\nI should like to have seen a plan or sketch of the proposed addition, also, some specifications and the approximate cost given. I doubt whether these have been prepared. However, rather than hold up the request for relief for what appears to be an unsatisfactory, (unsanitary) condition, I am forwarding the request immediately, without this necessary information.\n\nI would ask that a competent building carpenter check this place over and prepare plans, specifications, list of materials required etc., and the approximate cost of both material and labour. I suggest that a request be made to the Parks Branch, to have one of their Engineer Architects from Waterton Lakes or Banff, Alberta, do this, and report on what he considers should or can be done to improve conditions.\nI appreciate the Sister Superior's anxiety in the matter as it regards, and may affect, the health of the other sisters and the girl pupils, who assist with the bread making.\n\nI am not loosing sight of the fact the water supply at this school has not yet been remedied.\n\nI beg to ask that these matters receive the Department's early attention.\n\nC.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, 29th January, 1944.\n\nDear Father Routhier,\n\nIn Mr. Crear's absence from Ottawa I am replying to your wire of the 23rd instant with regard to the shortage of water at the Sacred Heart School in the Pelican Indian Reserve.\n\nThe delay in settling this matter has been unavoidable, and is due entirely to our efforts to arrive at some satisfactory solution. As you may know, $3,000.00 or more has already been spent in the drilling and cleaning of wells at this site. Before authorizing additional expenditures we felt we should find out all we could about the underground water supply and consulted our Geological Survey. The officer in charge of the Ground Water and Boring Section is of the opinion that we should not start any drilling operations unless we are prepared to go down 1,200 ft., where a satisfactory water boring horizon might be expected. Water might be encountered at a shallower depth but the chances are not good, and of course there is always the possibility that water might not be struck even at 1,200 ft. We have not obtained an estimate on the cost of drilling a deep well but it would probably be in excess of $10,000.00, and that amount of money is not now available. We do not want to have the school closed, and some doubt has been expressed as to the advisability of converting it into a day school at this stage. We would prefer having the present arrangement continued until after the war at least, provided some reasonably satisfactory temporary solution could be found. We are continuing to give thought to the matter and if you have any suggestions to make we will be glad to have them.\n\nThe reason why an adequate water supply was obtained at a shallower depth at the St. Cryprian school is explained as follows -\n\n\"St. Cryprian school well is located near the centre or on the eastern slope of a small structural trough in which any water that would be derived from the higher\n\nReverend H. Routhier, O.M.I.,\n9916 - 110th Street,\nEdmonton, Alberta.\n\np.t.o.\nground to the west or south and migrated along the contact of the Porcupine Hills and underlying impervious formation would be stopped and would accumulate under hydrostatic pressure and thus be available to produce an adequate supply when tapped by wells. The wells at the Sacred Heart School, on the other hand, are located on the N.E. side of a small anticlinal fold near the crest where there would be little, if any, catchment area and where any water that might migrate along the contact of the two formations would continue northeast down the slope. It is probable that it is this migration that gives rise to the small spring located in the water course situated about one thousand feet southeast of the school building. In that the three wells drilled penetrated the contact without encountering water, there appears to be little chance of locating an adequate supply in the immediate underlying formation.\"\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nC.W. Jackson,\nChief Executive Assistant.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 7, 1944.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nMr. C.P. Schmidt, Inspector of Indian Agencies, Calgary, Alta.\n\nLate last fall you wrote to us regarding the water situation at the Sacred Heart Residential School and subsequently we received several communications from Very Reverend H. Routhier and the Principal of the school.\n\nAll the correspondence and data which we had on file was submitted to the senior officials. Before authorizing additional expenditures it was felt that we should find out all we could about the underground water supply and, therefore, the Geological Survey was consulted. The officer in charge of the Ground Water and Boring Section is of the opinion that we should not start any drilling operations unless we are prepared to go down 1,200 feet where a satisfactory water boring horizon might be expected. Water might be encountered at a shallower depth, but the chances are not good and, of course, there is always the possibility that water might not be struck even at 1,200 feet.

The Department does not want to have the school closed and some doubt has been expressed as to the advisability of converting it into a day school at this stage.\n\nWe would prefer having the present arrangement continued until after the war at least, provided some reasonably satisfactory temporary solution could be found. We are continuing to give thought to the matter and, if you have any suggestions to make, we would be glad to receive them at the earliest possible date.\n\nR.A.

West\nCALGARY - ALBERTA\n\nFebruary 10th, 1944.\n\nC.W. Jackson,\nChief Executive Assistant,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have watched the struggle to obtain water for the 62 children and the 15 adults which has gone on at the R.C. Peigan Indian Reserve School, Brocket, Alberta (Sacred Heart School, Brocket), for the past number of months. Aside from the positive hardship endured by these 77 people on an isolated prairie, it is only good fortune that has not produced a catastrophe.\n\nI am aware of the uncertain success of well-drilling as set forth by your engineer's department and by past experience in the vicinity of the school and I understand the prudence of the Indian Affairs Branch in refusing to spend money on a probability. I can only agree with this prudence. But this does not solve the plight of the present situation.\n\nThe good graces of the C.P.R., the open winter, and a few other fortunate circumstances have allowed the hauling of water a distance of nearly six miles (12 miles return). It requires three such trips a day, when the weather permits, and the work of one man and a truck for a full day. Often the necessary trips cannot be made, and it is not unusual that the tanks of water are frozen into ice when they reach the school. The good circumstances allowing even this hazardous supply of water exist only from day to day. Anyone familiar with prairie conditions in winter would realize how really precarious the situation is.\n\nIf the Indian Affairs Branch has decided that nothing of a permanent nature is to be done on the part of the Department at present, as it appears from your recent letter, could not some temporary relief be granted?\n\nLast November, the Oblate Fathers decided from their consultation with local well-drillers that something could be done in well-drilling. On Dec. 15th they asked the permission of the Indian Affairs Branch to make the attempt at their own expense. That permission has not been granted. What objection has the Department to allowing it?\n\nIf ....\nIf this permission is not forthcoming and the present method must continue, it would seem that the Department should immediately make definite arrangements with the C.P.R. and provide a truck and a man to transport water from the Brocket station to the school, not only to release the school authorities from this work and allow them to do the work for which they are being paid but to insure the school of at least a sufficient supply of water.\n\nI assure you of my wish to co-operate with the Indian Department. At the same time, I feel certain this matter demands immediate action.\n\nYours cordially,\n\n'sgd' Francis P. Carroll.\n\nBishop of Calgary.\nOttawa, 14th February, 1944.\n\nDear Bishop Carroll,\n\nOn receipt of your letter of the 10th instant regarding water supply for the Sacred Heart School at Brocket, I asked the Indian Affairs Branch for information respecting the proposal which you said was submitted by the Oblate Fathers on December 15th. I find that a letter was received from Father Routhier on that date but it was not interpreted as suggesting that the Church should undertake the drilling of a well at its own expense. Father Routhier said -\n\n\"I would therefore request that the Oblate Fathers be authorized to hire a well driller as soon as possible to drill at the School to a depth of at least 700 feet if needs be. In the past, two wells at least were dug to a depth of 300 or a little more but in neither case have they found more than surface water. Mr. Bush offers to drill a well with a rotary equipment at a cost of $4.50 per foot, and the cost of the casing would be approximately $1.25 per foot. We are anxious that the work start as soon as possible, that is, not later than the 3rd of January, at which date Mr. Bush would be ready to start. The Oblate Fathers are ready to advance the money to start the work immediately and I do ask that there be no delay in giving an answer to my urgent request either by telegram or air mail to Edmonton.\"\n\nIf the Department is not expected to assume any portion of the cost of drilling, whether or not an adequate supply of good water is obtained, then we cannot very well raise serious objection. Is that what was proposed? Since that time our Geological Survey expressed the view that it would probably be necessary to drill down to around 1,200 ft. To provide for that possibility it might be necessary to start with a larger hole thus increasing the cost of drilling. How would this affect the offer of the Oblate Order if they intend bearing the cost of drilling for water? Perhaps you would be kind enough to let me know as soon as possible exactly what was proposed in Father Routhier's letter.\n\nThe Right Reverend Francis P. Carroll,\nBishop of Calgary,\n910 - 7A Street N. West,\nCalgary, Alberta.\nIf all that Father Routhier had in mind was that the Oblate Order would advance money with which to start work expecting to be reimbursed by the Dominion, then that does not solve our problem and probably the only possible temporary solution is to try to reach some arrangement with the Canadian Pacific Railway and work out some mutually satisfactory scheme for the carting of the water until the end of the present academic year at least.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nChief Executive Assistant.\nFebruary 19, 1944\n\nMr. C.W. Jackson,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Jackson:\n\nYour letter of January 29th reached me at the beginning of February. I frankly admit that I was keenly disappointed, and have the impression that we are striking against a stone wall with inadequate ammunition. Action and a will to solve the problem have been lacking.\n\nIn view of the consequences in case of fire, or the danger of an epidemic, I am giving orders to the Principal of the Sacred Heart School to begin drilling and to drill to a depth of 700 feet. This, we expect, will cost in the neighborhood of $5,000.00. Our resources do not allow us to go to 1200 feet. If the Department of Indian Affairs continues to remain as passive in this affair as in the past months, we shall bear the whole expense and have the school reimburse us if and when it can. If the Department sees that at least some of these obligations would rightly fall upon it, then we would appreciate any help whether in the drilling or the pumping once we strike water. If the Department is unwilling to help in any measure, we shall do all in our power to find a satisfactory solution, but I cannot imagine that such would be a permanent attitude.\n\nWith best wishes to yourself and trust the Department will understand my decision, I remain,\n\nSincerely,\n\nH. Routhier O.M.I., Prov.\nOttawa, February 24, 1944\n\nReverend H. Routhier, O.M.I.,\n9916 - 110th St.,\nEDMONTON, Alta.\n\nDear Father Routhier,\n\nI have your letter of the 19th instant in answer to mine of the 29th January. I am afraid there is nothing I can add to my letter or to the one I wrote to Bishop Carroll on the 14th instant, which you have no doubt seen by this time.\n\nI am sure you must appreciate the position of the Department. We have in the past authorized expenditures for the construction of wells on very meagre information and generally the results have been most disappointing. The officers in the Geological Survey are probably the best qualified people in Canada to advise in matters of this kind. To drill to the depth they recommended the expense would have exceeded $12,000. Apart from the fact that no funds have been provided in this year's estimates for the expenditure, it was felt that further consideration should be given to providing a temporary supply of water until the whole question could be thoroughly investigated.\n\nWe have noted that you now propose to drill a more shallow well at your own expense. It is to be hoped that you will find a satisfactory supply of water. You will no doubt advise the Department of the results of the experiment.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nChief Executive Assistant.\nIndian Affairs Branch\nPeygan Indian Reserve\n\nOn account with:\n\nSacred Heart Ind.

School to enquire what progress was being made with the new well they had undertaken to sink, by drilling, near the main building.\n\nThe information I was given was that drilling had been started on April 9th last, and work was stopped on June 9th \u2014 at 250 feet \u2014 for the reason that capable men could not be found to operate the machine.\n\nThe Reverend Principal could not tell me when work (drilling) would be resumed. He said he would reopen the school after the summer vacation; that he would take in fifty (50) pupils to begin with; that they would continue to haul water by truck and tank from the C.P.R. water tank at Brocket.\n\nIf the snow fall next winter is heavy, and it drifts, there will be times when the truck will not be able to make the trip.\n\nFor your information, please.\n\nC. Fant. Schmidt,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nYou will be pleased to hear that the contractor in charge of the Sacred Heart School Well, Brocket, Alta., is again at work with a satisfactory crew of mechanics. The machine for boring has been repaired, and daily progress is being made. The well is now down to 285 feet and, whilst there is yet no indication of a good supply of water, high hopes are being entertained that when the natural level of surrounding wells has been reached water will be found in quantities large enough to supply all the needs of the school, even after it has been enlarged.\n\nThe Principal, in the letter in which he gives me the above information, refers to the abnormally low pupilage of his school and the consequent difficulties of financial management. Post-war Indian Affairs appropriations should take such cases into serious consideration and provide an adequate remedy. If such small schools are not enabled to take more than 100 children an adjustment in the rate per pupil should be made. The present policy of the Department, whereby the larger schools are given larger grants might well be reversed, for it is admitted by those competent to judge that, financially speaking, the bigger schools can be operated for less per pupil than the smaller ones.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n\nSeptember 13th 1944\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF Sacred Heart Indian School Peigan Indian Agency Brocket\n\nVOTE Letter July 17th 1944 ALLOTMENT File21116 ALLOCATION SYMBOLS\n\nSHIP TO Sacred Heart Indian School Peigan Indian Agency Brocket\n\nPurpose for which required Floor of the Sacred Heart School.\n\n| QUANTITY | UNIT PRICE | TOTAL |\n|----------|------------|-------|\n| 4 Rolls of About 30 Yards each Battleship Linoleum 2 Yards wide (Light Green Cream) appr. $2.75 | $30.00 |\n| Cement to Lay Linoleum. $1.50 per Gallon | |\n\nAmount allowed $300.00 as per letter July 17th 1944 File 21-116.\n\nI hereby certify that I have personal knowledge that all the above articles are required in the Department and for Departmental purposes only.

We have had some correspondence with the War Assets Corporation, with regard to securing a water truck, but any equipment of this type that they have available at the present time is not suitable. To keep the school in operation it will be necessary to continue drawing water, as although the school management has drilled a well, to a depth of 594 feet, an adequate water supply was not obtained. The management now admits that if they had a 2\u00bd ton truck a suitable tank could be obtained and this would enable them to continue drawing the water that they require.\n\nI hereby certify that I have personal knowledge that all the above articles are required in the Department and for Departmental purposes only.

Hoey,\n\nWith reference to your requisition of April 3rd, for the purchase of a 2\u00bd-ton truck to be used in transporting water to the Sacred Heart Indian Residential School, at Brocket, Alberta, before requesting tenders it is necessary to know what wheelbase is required and if dual rear wheels are necessary. You might also advise as to the approximate dimensions of the water tank and the cost of same and if it is the intention to turn in the old truck on the purchase of a new one.\n\nI am enclosing copies of Form M. & S. 1595, which have to be filled out in order to secure a permit. When these forms are returned, and the above information supplied, steps will be taken to secure a suitable truck.\n\nDepartmental Purchasing Agent.\nOttawa University,\nLaurier Ave. East,\nOttawa, April 17, 1945.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\n- Attention: Mr. Phelan -\n\nI have yours of the 10th instant, regarding the truck which it is your intention to purchase for the Sacred Heart Indian Residential School, Brocket, Alberta.\n\nI am informed by the International Harvester Company, Truck Division, that their Model K-5, 2-ton wheel base, 159\", with a carrying gross capacity of 14500 lbs., would perform the work of hauling water for the Brocket School very satisfactorily. I have therefore filled out the Application for Permit based on the above information.\n\nAs far as the tank is concerned, the Ottawa Boiler Works, of Ottawa, agree to supply same for $160.80, tax included, and the freight from Ottawa to Brocket would be $42.00. This tank would have a capacity of 700 gallons and would be of a size suitable for the needs of the school, as it would be sufficient to make four trips per day to secure the necessary water supply. The above tank would be oval in shape, 5 ft. in diameter and 3 ft. in height, 9 ft. in length and would weigh about 300 lbs. It would be made of galvanized iron, Gauge No. 10. The tank will be provided with a manhole on top and a 5\" outlet at the rear end.\n\nHoping the above information will enable you to place the order for both the truck and tank, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Date]\nOttawa, April 18, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT.\n\nI desire to refer to your memorandum of April 10, (File 57687-18-11) with reference to our requisition of April 3 for a 2\u00bd ton truck to be used for transporting water to the Sacred Heart Indian Residential School.\n\nOn receipt of your memorandum we consulted the school management and we are now advised that an International Harvester Company Model K-5, 2-ton truck, with wheel base of 159\", has a gross carrying capacity of 14,500 lbs. This truck, or equal, would perform the work of hauling water for the Brocket School very satisfactorily. We have, therefore, completed the application for Permit, based on this information.\n\nA suitable water tank can be obtained from the Ottawa Boiler Works, Ottawa, at a cost of $160.50, tax included, and the freight on same from Ottawa to Brocket will be approximately $42.50. This tank would have a capacity of 700 gallons and would be a size suitable for the needs of the school. The tank would be oval in shape, 5 ft. in diameter, 3 ft. in height, 9 ft. in length and would weigh about 800 lbs. It would be made of galvanized iron gauge No. 10. There would be a manhole on top and a 3 inch outlet at the rear end. The price just mentioned would include not only the tank but the sleepers, apron and \"U\" bars required to hold the tank in proper position on the truck.\n\nIt is not the intention to turn in the old truck, as it is owned by the school management and can be used for minor work in connection with their farming operations.\n\nAs intimated in our requisition of April 3, it\n\np.t.o.\nis very important that this truck should be supplied and the management would appreciate both the truck and the tank at the earliest possible date.\n\nActing Director.\n| DATE   | SERVICE                                                                 | AMOUNT |\n|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| April 21 | To Allowance towards Salary of man driving truck which transports water for the Sacred Heart Res.

This arrangement being unsatisfactory and quite expensive, there was some doubt prevailing as to whether this institution could carry on as a residential school on the present site (location). Also, there being more children of school age not in school because of lack of room, and the question of building an addition being often set back on account of the lack of water, the suggestion of asking that the building be moved to another location, was expressed in some quarters. Because of all this, only very necessary repairs were done to the buildings, and no exterior painting has been done for several years.\n\nDuring the month of August this year, a sixth attempt to sink a new well was made on a new location, 700 feet South-west of the main building. Water was found approximately 300 feet, and two tests were made with a duration of 15 hours' duration gave 10 gallons per minute without lowering the depth of the water in the casing. The Principal will have an underground pipe-line laid to connect this well with the School pressure tanks, as soon as he can get help (labour) to do the digging. The Indians are now busy working at harvesting. He expects to have this completed early in October.\n\nIf, when this is done, the water supply is satisfactory, we will check up on all necessary repairs, and the painting of the exterior of all buildings. The main school building will require three coats of oil paint, as the lumber is showing signs of chalking, and needs a good oil varnish. The barn and outbuildings require two coats of modern oil paint. Owing to the lateness of the season, it may not be possible to do the painting this Autumn; however, I would ask that the materials\u2014paint, brushes \u2014 be purchased from this year's appropriation, and delivered at the School, the work to be done when the fine weather comes in April or May.\n\nC.

Schmidt Esqr Inspector of Indian Agencies Calgary.\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 17th inst File 406-11A C.E.\n\nOn my return from Calgary I had Mr Pearson go out and clean out the two tanks, and made two trips to the School while this was being done, the tanks were very badly plugged with sand and mud, but a good job was made of the cleaning out.\n\nThe water after the clean out had been made was much clearer, and getting clearer every day, and both the Plumber and myself are satisfied that the dirty water was caused from the sand and mud in the tanks being riled every time the Pump was working.\n\nThe Blow nipple on the Tank has been repaired, and the cleaning out of the Tanks should be able to be done without any trouble from now on by the Engineer.\n\nMr Pearson advises me that when he sends in his account he will make a report on the Tanks, and what was found when the work was done.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nFor your information, please,\n\nCalgary,\nSept. 27,\n1945.\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES FORM No. I.A. 506A\n\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nPay to: Rev.

Millan\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nRE: Brocket Indian Residential School.\n\nAttention: Mr. Phelan.\n\nMy dear Mr. Phelan:\n\nI had the occasion, a few weeks ago, to visit the above school and I hereby submit a list of requirements badly needed to make its operation possible with the small pupilage which it is authorized to receive.\n\n10- The building which is of frame construction has not been painted for over 10 years and looks the part. This is something which must be done next spring.\n\n20- The floors in the boys dormitory are too far gone for repair and must be totally replaced.\n\n30- The hot water tank has been repaired on several occasions and is, at the present time, in such bad condition that a new one is necessary.\n\n40- The batteries, which are 7 years old, are in poor condition and must be replaced this year. They were installed in 1939.\n\n50- The laundry was never properly supplied with machinery and the need for an upright steam boiler is essential and should be supplied immediately.\n\nBesides the above there are two other points\n\n2......\nto which I must call your attention:\n\nThe school was built for 50 pupils, it has now 70 and will continue to have, at least that many as the Reserve is rapidly increasing in number. For instance, last year, 1944, there were 25 births and only one death. This year, 1945, up to September the 25th, there were 20 births, and if I am well informed, no deaths. To take care of the demands for admission, the present pupilage of the school should be at least 90, but as it will be impossible to house that number, the Principal is now asking for a pupilage of 70.\n\nThe School should be enlarged immediately. We would suggest the building of a wing on the west side of the present building to provide accommodation for the girls. A Chapel could be erected over the present kitchen and laundry; the present Chapel cannot accommodate more than the 70 children which the Principal is now asking for.\n\nThe above is a comprehensive program and your Department will, no doubt, wish that an inspection of the school be made immediately to verify the statements which I have just formulated. This inspection is now invited and the hope is expressed that it will take place without delay.\n\nIn the past, the water question for the school seems to have been in the way, whenever major repairs were asked for, but now that it has been settled and that a good water supply has been found, we cannot see why your Department should not give this school what it has generously provided for similar institutions.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nJ.O. Plourde, O.M.I.\nOttawa, 31st October, 1945.\n\nMr. A. McMillan, Indian Agent, Brocket, Alberta.\n\nWith reference to the Sacred Heart Indian Residential School, I am advised that the following improvements are required immediately:\n\n(1) The hot water tank has been repaired on several occasions and is, at the present time, in such bad condition that a new one is necessary.\n\n(2) The batteries, which are 7 years old, are in poor condition and must be replaced this year. They were installed in 1939.\n\n(3) The laundry was never properly supplied with machinery and the need for an upright steam boiler is essential and should be supplied immediately.\n\nPlease let me know your ideas regarding the necessity for making the above replacements. In view of your recommending the replacements mentioned above, you should supply full particulars regarding the type and size of equipment required in each case.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nSIMMONS LIMITED\nWINNIPEG\n\nInvoice No. 6774\n\nDate: June 14th, 1945.\nSold to: Sacred Heart Indian Residential School,\nBrocket, Alta.\n\nTerms: Net 30 FOB Calgary.

Under,\nGeneral Executive Assistant,\nSurveyor Engineer,\nCartier Bldg.,\n\nRe: Possibility of securing an adequate water supply at Sacred Heart Residential School in Peigan Indian Reserve No. 147, located in S.W. Section 7, Township 7, Range 27 West of the 6th Meridian, six miles east and one mile south of village of Brocket, Alberta.\n\nThe Geological Survey has on file very little information pertaining to the underground water resources of the Peigan Indian Reserve, no systematic water survey has been made of this part of Alberta. The geological mapping to date in this agency has been of a reconnaissance character for the compilation of the Calgary Sheet, Map 204A published on a scale of 1\" = 5 miles. A copy of this map with accompanying sheet of structure sections, is submitted herewith.\n\nIt appears that there are two residential schools located in this reserve, one the St. Cyril's Residential School located near the southwest corner of Section 7, TP. 7, Range 27W and the Sacred Heart Residential School located in the southeast quarter, Section 7, TP. 7, Range 27W of the 4th Meridian. A well sunk to an unstated depth at the St. Cyril's School is said to be supplying an adequate amount of water for school purposes whereas three wells drilled at the Sacred Heart School to a depth of about 300 feet encountered only a small supply of water, inadequate for school purposes. These latter wells are located at an elevation of about 3600 feet for about 25 feet above the level of Oldman River and reach to a depth of about 50 feet below the river.\n\nOn the geological map referred to above, the boundary of the Peigan Indian Reserve, the positions of the two residential schools, the approximate boundaries of the several outcropping geological formations and symbols showing the dip and strike of the rock at few localities. The subsurface structure of the underlying formations in the vicinity of Peigan Agency is diagrammatically portrayed on the left or west end of structure section N.F. of the accompanying structure section sheet in the area enclosed by the rectangle indicated by pencil.\n\nIt will be noted on referring to the map, the map legend and Structure Section N.F. that the residential schools are located in an area underlain by the Porcupine Hills Formation (Triassic) Tertiary age and that this formation is overlain by the Willow Creek Formation (Triassic) also of Tertiary age that is exposed along the valley of Oldman River. The Porcupine Hills formation consists mainly of fine and coarse-grained cross-bedded sandstones interbedded sandy clay and has a total thickness of about 250 feet. Within this part of the reserve however, the thickness of the formation is confined to the lowermost 50 feet. The formation contains several good water-bearing horizons, but the relatively small area underlain by these beds makes in this part of the reserve so restricts the aquifer area as to practically eliminate any water possibilities from it. The water supplies are being obtained from the wells at the two schools. It is thought to be derived from a porous sandstone horizon at the base of the formation or at the contact between it and the underlying shale formation. The reasonably good water supply is being secured at the St. Cyril's school and very little at the Sacred Heart School.\nWelfare and Training\n\nSchools\n\nSacred Heart. This school reopened on September 4th with the majority of the pupils returning on time. There were 56 pupils in attendance when I visited the School.\n\nThe new well drilled some distance from the school buildings this summer hit water at 100 feet and the well was put down to 300 feet.\n\nThe trench dug from the well to the pressure tank at the school is close to completion, as is the small building being placed over the well and pump.\n\nThe engine is awaiting a few parts and the Principal advises me that with good weather they should be hooked up with the new well early in October; if this happens the Voucher for $100.00 allowed for assistance in hauling water will be dispensed with, however if the connections are not completed it may be necessary to Voucher for another month, I will stop any further Voucher for this purpose as soon as the work is completed.\n\nAnthony McMillan,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, 29th November, 1945.\n\nMr. A. McMillan, Indian Agent, Brocket, Alberta.\n\nI desire to refer you to my letter of October 31st with reference to certain improvements requested for the Sacred Heart Indian Residential School. An early reply to that letter would be very much appreciated.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch Dept of Mines & Resources Ottawa.\n\nAttention Mr Phelan,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter File 116-2-5 of the 31st ult., and the following is my opinion of the questions which you ask.\n\n1. Hot Water Tank. This Tank certainly needs replacement and has been on the Estimates for the past two years. The quotation received from the Plumber is for a 4' x 36\" Hot Water Tank with all fittings and a Heating Coil for $165.00; Installation of same was quoted at $125.00 if he provides the Tank otherwise he wishes to make another bid on installation if provided otherwise.\n\n2. Batteries. I have not been advised by the Globelite Battery Company who inspected these batteries recently, that they were bought in 1940, and are good for one or two years use. I would therefore leave this item over till next year for consideration.\n\n3. Laundry Equipment. The plumber quoted on this item which is badly needed, a 92 Imperial Galon Tank and stand at $70.00; Jacket Heater for Heating same $45.00 and installation with pipe fittings and valve and labor at $50.00 making a total of $165.00 for this item.\n\nThe plumber who gave me the above figures is Mr Stanley Pearson Pincher Creek. I would recommend the work in No 1 and No 3 Be done as soon as possible if funds available.\n\nAnthony M. Millar\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, December 4, 1945.\n\nMr. A. McMillan, Indian Agent,\nBrocket, Alberta.\n\nI have your letter of the 22nd ultimo, with reference to the Sacred Heart Indian Residential School. If you refer to my letter of October 31, you will note that we were informed that an upright steam boiler is essential. Is this the type of boiler on which Mr. Pearson has quoted a price?\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, December 4, 1945.\n\nMr. A. McMillan, Indian Agent,\nBrocket, Alberta.\n\nWe have been informed verbally and have also noted from some of your recent reports that the management of the Sacred Heart Residential School has been successful in securing water. However, we have no detailed report regarding the matter and I would appreciate it if you would interview the Principal and submit a report, which should include the following information:\n\n(a) Approximate depth of well\n(b) Number of gallons of water per day that is available.\n(c) Does well give indication of proving a permanent source for water?\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nOttawa, December 4, 1945.\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa.

This well was drilled to the depth of 300 feet when they got a plentiful supply of water running for 12 hours at the rate of 10 Gallons per minute.\n\nGallons of Water (Per day) On the basis of the pumping to date this well should give an approximate gallonage of 1500 per day.\n\nIndications for water supply Water seems to be plentiful but has only been running for 2 days, and is a little early to give an opinion as to permanency, but with the present rate during pumping and the tests when drilling was completed, it would seem that the School will have a plentiful supply of water.\n\nGeneral Comments. This well which is the seventh well drilled during their effort to get water is situated 700 feet from the Tank at the School. It is connected with the tanks with a 2\" Pipe which runs into the present Tanks; from the 2\" Pipe connected the barns 500 feet away with water. A shelter has been built over the Pump head and closer in the pump from the weather. This well sits up on the side of the hill to the South West of the School, and is on the level of the second floor of the School not counting the basement. The well is run by a gas engine connected to the Pump which used to used when the well in the school was running. The slope from the well is very good fall for the water. This well is situated on the SW\u00bc of 7-7-27 west 4th. Approximately $7500.00 was spent getting water.\n\nAfter this well has had a good trial I will make a further report as to the capacity, and manner in which the well is working.\n\nAnthony Maclean\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch Dept of Mines & Resources Ottawa.\n\nAttention Mr Phelan,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your Letter File 116-2-5 of the 4th inst regarding the upright steam Boiler at the Sacred Heart Indian Residential School.\n\nI discussed this with the Principal, and also with Mr Pearson, the Plumber, since receiving your last letter. Mr Pearson and I figured this was for heating water for the Laundry separate. However in discussing the matter with the Principal, and the brother who is Engineer, it seems that Father J.O. Plourde and the Brother have in mind placing all the water tanks on a steam basis, including the large hot water Tank under the heading of No 1 on your previous letter.\n\nMr Pearson does not think this is practical, and would necessitate an Engineer with papers to run same.\n\nAs Father Crepeau and myself are at a loss to know exactly what is wanted by the present Engineer and placed before Father Plourde, would it not be advisable for Father Plourde to place his wishes before you and have a steam Engineer advise as to the class of equipment needed, when I could go ahead and get bids.\n\nMr Pearson has stated that he was in error on the 92 Gallon Tank it should have been 250, but as this does not seem to be the type wanted, I will await further information before getting any further bids.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, 19th December, 1945.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nWith reference to Item 5 in your letter of October 24th regarding the Sacred Heart Indian Residential School and our subsequent conversation in connection with the boiler, I enclose for your information, a copy of letter received from Indian Agent McMillan.\n\nI would appreciate it if you would discuss this matter further with me.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nReverend J.O. Plourde, O.M.I.,\nUniversity of Ottawa,\nLaurier Avenue East,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, 19th December, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nRe: Sacred Heart Indian Residential School, Peigan Agency, Brocket, Alta.\n\nI desire to refer you to our memorandum of March 13th, 1946, and correspondence previous to that date with reference to building a well at the above mentioned school.\n\nI enclose for your information copy of letter dated December 13th received from Indian Agent McMillan.\n\nMr. Jackson's memorandum of July 27th authorized an expenditure of $1,000.00 towards the cost of purchasing a truck to transport water. The school did not purchase the truck and consequently no payment has been made.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector.\n\n[Handwritten note]\nMailed Dec 20/45\na.m.\nOttawa, 19th December, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR, SURVEYS AND ENGINEERING BRANCH\n\nRe: Sacred Heart Indian Residential School\nPelican Indian Agency, Frog Lake, Alta.\n\nYou will remember that about a year ago there was considerable correspondence with reference to drilling for water at the above mentioned school. During the past summer the school management made a determined effort to find water and apparently has been successful as will be noted from the enclosed copy of letter received from Indian Agent McMillan.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, January 6, 1946.\n\nMr. A. McMillan, Indian Agent,\nBrocket, Alberta.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 13th ultimo and previous correspondence, regarding the upright steam boiler for the Sacred Heart Indian Residential School, I am informed that a member recently added to the staff of this school is capable of handling the steam boiler. You should have him prepare and forward detailed information regarding the type of boiler required, so that the order may be placed through our Purchasing Branch.\n\nWith reference to Purchase Order No. 7106, for a hot water tank, please let me know if this has been installed.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nMy dear Mr. Hoey:\n\nThe persevering efforts of the Principal of the Brocket school, in securing an ample water supply for his school, have at last been rewarded, if I may judge from several letters which he has written to me during the last few months. In his latest communication he definitely states that the new well can supply 15,000 gallons of water per day. A pump house has been erected, about seven hundred feet of 2\" pipe laid from it to the pressure tanks in the basement of the school and the barn has also been connected with a 1\" pipe.\n\nThe digging of the well, the erection of the pump house, the laying of pipes to connect the new well with the pressure boiler and the barn, have naturally cost a large amount, and the Principal is now expecting the Department to reimburse him. I am informed that close to $7,000.00 have been spent on the project, which is considered fairly reasonable when the number of wells dug before striking water is taken into consideration. We are prepared to supply invoices for work and materials.\n\nI would, therefore, be very much obliged if you would give this matter your early consideration.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.O. Flourde, O.M.I.\nOttawa, 16th January, 1946.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nWe are in receipt of your letter of 8th instant with reference to the new well at the Sacred Heart Residential School.\n\nI discussed the contents of your communication with the Director and he expressed the opinion it would be advisable for you to interview the Minister with regard to securing a refund of the amount expended in digging the well.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nReverend J.O. Plourde, O.M.I.,\nUniversity of Ottawa,\nLaurier Ave. East,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n| DATE | SERVICE                                                                 | AMOUNT |\n|------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Feb 31 | Grant towards Salary for Night Watchman at Sacred Heart Indian Res.

Principal\nCharles Middleton Esqr Acting Principal.\n\nSir,\n\nGentlemen;\n\nWith Members of the Brocket Local of the Indian Association of Alberta will like to take this opportunity to discuss all matters concerning the two Residential Schools on the Peigan Reserve, and with your co-operation, would like to have all matters arrange and settle.\n\nWe have made a thorough investigation of these schools with the approval of Mr McMillan and the Principals of the said schools and have seen and heard the needs and dangerous conditions our children are subjected to.\n\nIn the case of the R.C School it simply cannot stand up to the winds we have on this Reserve.\n\nSome years ago this School was supported by two iron rods on the second floor crosswise. One rod was on the West end of the building, and the other on the East end. Under present conditions it is worse off than it was before.\n\nIn the boys Dormitory for instance, on windy nights they have to hold their beds to prevent them from hanging together.\n\nIn the girls dormitory which is on the West end of the building, the smaller girls are awakened from their sleep and start crying for fear the building will blow away.\n\nAnother proof is that this building is unfit for occupation that is the roof leaks when it rains and when the snow is melting.\n\nAnother instance, in case fire should break out on the West end of the School which occupied by the girls, how are they going to escape the fire, as the stairways are on the same West end, and without another means of escaping thru, there's no door connecting both dormitories and thus supposing fire breaks out on the East end which is on the boys side, now where are they going to get out to the West side.\n\nThe Girls Playroom which is 15 X 40 has no sunshine and poor ventilation and is absolutely unfit for them, and also the rest rooms are annoying for their health of these girls of 40 who are squeezed in these rooms.\n\nIt is resolved that this complaint brought up are also concerning to the St. Agnes School but do not know whether the beds in the dormitory hang together but is as dangerous too.\n\nSo far all these dangerous conditions we ask with a confident heart that you would help us with our urgent plea in where we are sacrificing our most beloved children for whom we would be only too thankful for any assistance done for their safety.\n\nYou may never understand our worries and our parents undertake when these high winds start especially at night. Now our wish is that we should take them home for safety, till these buildings are guaranteed safe. We also ask that an immediate action be given the sooner the better, or give new schools.\n\nYours,\n\nIndian Association of Alberta.\n\nRead and left at the Office by Bob Crow Eagle as Director.\nIndian Affairs Branch Dept of Mines & Resources Ottawa.\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a Copy of Letter received from Bob Crow Eagle signed Indian Alberta Association, I was requested by Bob Crow Eagle previously for permission for him and three men to visit the Schools, in the cases of the Sacred Heart School, (R.C.) with three Catholics, and in the case of St Cyprians School with three Anglicans, all Members of the Association.\n\nAs will be noted the bulk of the letter is an exaggeration of the stories told by the children, the wind blows here and no mistake about it, but the only effect is the shaking of the beds, and I have never heard of anything moving around. The roofs of the Schools leak slightly in severe heavy rains, and with Moccasin telegraph, and some rather crude statements made over the radio of high winds up to 100 miles per hour the Indians have worked themselves up over the possibility of the schools collapsing, and asked for their removal till the storm was over. This was not done.\n\nHowever the remark re the Girl's Dormitory is worthy of attention, if a fire started in the West end of the School and came up the stairway, which adjoins the Fire Escape, there is only a blank solid wall between this room and the rest of the School, which would leave a trap. Plans of either school will show this. It might be possible to place a door thorough into the Matrons room which would give an exit from the dormitory into the main part of the School if necessary, I feel that this point plus the question of more light and ventilation, could be thoroughly checked this summer, if expert crews are available when the Post War Project is looked into.\n\nFurther discussion at the meeting, re Loans have not been completed, and will be discussed.\ndiscussed at a later meeting.\n\nThis is the result of the first meeting I have had with the Indian Association of Alberta, and they've carried their business through in a very nice manner.\n\nI will be glad of your opinion on the matters mentioned in their letter, and possibly I may have your viewpoint as to whether I will advise them that the subject matter is receiving attention, and will be considered in the future.\n\nAnthony M.

The possible repairs in order to be done this year are as follows:\n\n1. Hardwood floor for the boys dormitory 36'x30'2\" and the putting down of the new floor. This would run around $400.00.\n2.

A considerable number of children will have to be refused again this year, because the school is too small.\n\nThe building of a wing 30 by 36, on the north side of the school would answer the present needs for at least five or six years to come. The estimates would round between $18 or $20,000 dollars and I hope that you will be able to have this included in the 1946-1947 budget.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.G.

McMillan Agent\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise that for the past month I have been in close touch with the school head School Principal, re the condition of the well.\n\nIt is causing a considerable amount of worry and I wish to place before the branch what I have done to date, one month ago and previous I had regular visits from the Principal regarding the inability to get sufficient water and that they were hauling water from town. I immediately had an inspection made on the well and the well driller found 17 links or a cow chain in the well and a new cylinder had to be put in this voucher is going forward, and is $25.00 above the original estimate was $200.00. The well ran very well for a few days after the chain had been removed, but has now fallen down in the quantity pumped.\n\nPosition of Well Now:\n\nIt would seem that this well is now pumping far short of sufficient water to carry the School, and the truck and tank must be brought into use. During the severe snowstorm of the last two weeks when the roads were impassable and the shortage of water was acute, I along with the Principal took it upon ourselves to let the children out from Friday evening November 1st to Sunday evening November 3rd, to allow the well to catch up, and also give time for the truck to haul water for the following day. From my knowledge that instead of running at the bottom of the well, we are drawing from the surrounding lake, which has to fill up before the next pumping, I am in a quandary as to what is the correct way to handle this question, and am writing to see if the branch concurs in the week end for the children, and also the payment as was done last year of an allowance of $40.00 per month, I think will please to our long drawn out paymaster as he sees it not I don't think much hope for any increase in supply from the well;\n\nI would like the branch's advice on comment on this matter, so that it at any time this school is unable to keep a satisfactory supply of water, may know what action to take re the children if there is any possibility of an outbreak from the shortage of water, and inability to flush the toilets.\n\nIndian Agent.\nCopy forwarded to Mr. G.H.

McMillan, Indian Agent,\nBROCKET, Alta.\n\nWe have your letter of the 5th instant and regret to learn that the water situation at the Sacred Heart Residential School is unsatisfactory.\n\nIn view of the contents of your letter, the following procedure is approved:\n\n1. While the water shortage continues, the children may be allowed home on Friday evening and return to the school on Sunday evening. It should be distinctly understood by all parties concerned that this is only a temporary arrangement and if the water situation improves, the children should remain in the school. You will realize that in spite of the fact that this is an unusual situation, it will quite possibly encourage other schools to request the privilege of allowing the children home for weekends which is a practice that the Department has never approved.\n\n2. For the period that it is necessary to draw water, we will allow the same amount as last year for the services of the driver, namely $100. a month.\n\nBernard F.

New woodards should be put in the well as soon as obtainable, as there is some worn pretty badly.\n\nAlso the float vent was plugged, which we cleared up so it will drain back to 11 ft below ground when the pump is shut down. A new 3 in all brass new leather & spool valves was installed the old one can be kept there for a spare which is in fair shape.\n\nThe new cylinder was purchased from the Blood agency at Cardston.\n\nWe put a boil test on the well which was checked by Father Sherron of the St Mary's school Cardston.\nWe found the static level of the well to be 194 ft from the top of the casing.\n\nIn bailing at 6.2 ft/s per minute for 45 minutes we took the head down 35 ft to a level of 229 ft. We shut down for 15 minutes & the water came back 23 ft or to a level of 206 ft which seems to indicate quite a stream of water. We also cleaned the bottom of well which was not so very dirty.\n\nThere is 14 ft of 2\" Pump pipe below the 3\" cylinder which makes a total of 287 ft of Pump which stands into the water for 93 ft.\n\nWe installed Pump Jack etc. & put a test on the well when pumping.\n\nAt 30 Strokes - 6 inch stroke of the jack per min.\n\nIt is now Pumping 5 Gals in 1 minute = 45 acre.\n\nWhich if it holds at that for 4 to 8 hrs they can Install the larger pump for the Pump engine which they have & give it a try & see if it holds up OK.

C. School\n\nWith 30 inches of snow on the level, and transportation practically stopped from MacLeod West, I have just received a visit from Father La France, Principal of the Sacred Heart School that the water situation is grave, and have arranged with him to allow the children out till the truck can start hauling again. As this was a very serious position I immediately contacted Mr. Blair who has a bull dozer, and arranged for him to come out and clear the road to the School so that the Sacred Heart Truck can commence hauling, in doing this he will pass the Agency, and open up the road into the hospital. This will only be temporary till the wind has passed over and the snow has drifted. I am satisfied we will be able to make a trail through the fields, so that the water can be hauled.\n\nI felt in making this report that with the worst storm of many years hitting this district that the above information would quiet any worry the Dept might feel from radio and press reports.

Our truck that has been on the go for years in such roads is a total wreck, and I can foresee that very soon we will be without means of hauling.\n\nMay I suggest to you and your Department the purchase of a new truck and tank of a capacity of 1000 gallons that will enable to keep the School going.\n\nDue to the unpredictable weather, and the conditions of the roads I think that it is imperative to have a reservoir of a capacity of 5000 to 10,000 gallons that would enable us to go on during the periods of bad weather or whenever we are unable to haul water.\n\nI feel that at the moment that this is the most practical suggestion, at least the most practical plan. Hoping that this will meet with your approval and that of your Department in Ottawa.\n\nI remain sincerely yours\n\nSgd Maurice La France  \nPrincipal.\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a Copy of a letter received from the Principal of the Sacred Heart School in connection with the water situation at the School, and especially the question of transportation for the water from the C.P.R. Tank to the School.\n\nThere is no question that during the last two months they have had a very hard time trying to haul the necessary water from the tank to the School. With heavy snow falls and heavy winds drifting the snow all trails on the prairies have been blocked, we have opened the roads twice in different locations, just to have them fill in with the first wind. There is no doubt that the truck they have is taking a heavy test, and at present is in the Garage for temporary repairs.\n\nI met Father Le France, along with Father Charron, (who I understand discussed the water question with the Branch) last week and went thoroughly into the matter with him. There is no question that at the present time they need better equipment for transportation of the water, but as the question of a Reservoir could not be taken up till spring it would be much better, to face the transportation question now with further discussion on the Reservoir later on when equipment would be available and the work could be done.\n\nIn regard to the Transportation there is no doubt that a truck with a tank of the capacity of 1000 Gallons would be the best use, and would allow of one trip being made where three trips are now being made. I am led to believe that Father Charron was advised that there was $100.00 available for this purpose but that this amount would not cover the cost. We will have to face the situation that the wells at this school are negligible with occasional periods when a small number of water will be needed, and to keep the school running it will be necessary to haul all the time, which with the type of winter we are going through will be difficult.\n\nI would recommend that a Truck with a 1000 Gallon Tank be purchased for the purpose of hauling water for this school, and that consideration be given to the question of a storage capacity of approximately 10,000 Gallons be considered immediately, so that if a affirmative decision is made, the work may be done in suitable weather.\n\nIndian Agent.\nSacred Heart Ind. Res. School\nBrocket, Alberta,\nJanuary 14, 1947.\n\nMr. Bernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn December 1946, I forwarded to your office through your agent at Brocket, an urgent request for a new truck and tank of 1000 gal. capacity for hauling water. The present truck which has been in use for the last 8 years, is practically a total wreck due to the terrible conditions of the roads, and the weather which has been especially severe this winter.\n\nMy intention in renewing this matter to your consideration is that, because of the continual breaking down of the present truck, I fear we might be forced to send the children home for an indefinite period of time through lack of water. Our Indian children would thus be exposed to sickness, having to travel home through sub zero weather, and being fed at home with a poor and insufficient diet.\n\nI would not forward this request to you if I would but slightly doubt that it is before hand fully supported by your local Agent who is in position to judge of our critical situation.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\nFather Maurice Lefrancois, O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\nMemorandum: Acting Deputy Minister\n\nEnclosed is a requisition for a truck to carry water at the Sacred Heart Indian Residential School in the Peigan Agency in the Province of Alberta.\n\nThe water supply at this school has caused trouble for several years past and when the well gave out, the water had to be transported. In 1945 the school management dug a new well and a plentiful supply of water was secured. However, this particular well has also given out and it has been necessary to again transport water.\n\nIn July, 1945 we offered to allow the school management $1,000.00 towards the purchase of a new truck for carrying water but owing to conditions at that time they were unable to secure a truck for the amount offered by the Department.\n\nWe feel that a new truck should be supplied the school at the present time to transport water and I would appreciate it if the attached requisition receives favourable consideration.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, 22 January 1947.\n\nMr. A. McMillan, Indian Agent,\nBROCKET, Alberta.\n\nWith reference to your letter of Dec. 16th regarding the water situation at the Sacred Heart Residential School, you may inform the principal that our Purchasing Branch has been requested to purchase a truck for carrying water.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, January 22, 1947.\n\nReverend Father:\n\nI have delayed answering your letter of January 14 while ensuring that the Minister's office was doing everything possible to obtain the truck which you require. The big difficulty is the purchasing of these vehicles. In the case of the Sandy Bay Residential School we were many months finding a suitable truck. In fact this truck was only obtained last week for their school, which is in a very similar position to your own insofar as the water supply is concerned.\n\nThe Director has just written again to the Deputy Minister enclosing a requisition for a new truck for your school. Mr. MacMillan has written us on several occasions at great length and has enclosed copies of your letters dealing with the critical water situation at your school.\n\nAs soon as we hear from the Departmental Purchasing Agent I will write you further in this matter.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard E.

Box 560.\n\nMr A McMillan Indian Agent\nBrocket, Alberta.\n\nDear Sir\u2014\n\nI would like to suggest a further try for a water supply at the Sacred Heart School Brocket Alberta, as I firmly believe there is sufficient water to be had.\n\nWhen I was testing for a supply two years ago we ran across a supply of 5 Gallons per minute approximately 100 yds due East of the present well at a depth of 120-130 feet. As told by an Official not sufficient water was found in the present location going down to a depth of 180-190 feet we struck 11 Gallons per minute, which was all it would do with a pump test of 24 hours we held at 11 Gallons which was all it would do, and a very nice well which stood an open hole all the way. We then did some prospecting to a further depth of 300 feet with no more water encountered.\n\nI would like to suggest you try a hole approximately 50 to 100 Yards South West of the present well. We need no casing to test to 200 feet at a drilling price of \u00a32.50 per foot. If we strike a good flow we can then move on to the present well and abandon it which I believe we can salvage it all which is valued at approximately \u00a3800.00 to 900.00, which is quite a saving in a cost of \u00a3100.00 for labor to tear it out.\n\nAfter the present well was drilled by me, they had a good supply of water for 6 or 10 months at a pumping rate of 5 Gallons per minute, which I suggested and knew would not harm the well. The reason I suggested was that the water bearing strata is in shale with silt not sand bed and by pulling too much water at too steady a rate it might plug itself off in the bed. But during the hot summer months they pumped for Laundry and the garden 11 gallons per minute for a period of 45 Hours, and when they started up again the water supply had decreased. I then made several trips to see if I could bring it back but no luck. One trip was for a broken chain dropped into the plunger locking the cylinder etc., which no one seemed to know how it got there. They have 700 feet of new No 2 water line to the buildings laid below frost. So by going approximately 100 Yards South West they can hook into the line without much expense. I am now drilling for your Agency which you know and if I could move to the School right from here. Again I hope to be of service to you.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nWilliam W Maughan\nWell Driller.\nIndian Affairs Branch Dept of Mines & Resources Ottawa.\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a report mailed to me by Mr Wm Maughan Well Driller.\n\nWhen he started drilling at this Agency he brought up this question verbally, and I asked him to put it in writing so that I could send you a copy of his report. It will be noted that in the event of this being accepted he quotes the cost of drilling, and pulling of old equipment as the only expense, however I have discussed this with Father La France and they will expect that if the old equipment in the old well is used payment for the Casing etc on approximately 50 to 60% basis.\n\nThe one reason I have sent this report forward that if a well can be found, it will save the monthly payment of $100.00 per month we are now paying for Hauling water from the C.P.R. Tank at Brocket.\n\nNot being well enough versed in the water strata question, I would not care to recommend this without the advice of some of your Engineers. However if considered advisable I will keep a good lookout on the work done.\n\nAnthony M. Murray\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, January 28, 1947.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDOCTOR FALCONER\n\nWell Drilling at\nThe Peigan Reserve.\n\nCan you please advise me whether Mr. Maughan is doing any work for you in this agency and, if so, what success you are having in getting water.\n\nBernard F.

Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training\n\nReferring to your memorandum concerning well drilling at the Pelican Reserve, we have the following report from Indian Agent McMillan that the depth of the well is approximately 200 feet, water rises to 100 feet from surface.\n\nI am sending you our file 51-116-5 in which there is a sketch and a report on this well drilling.\n\nW. L. Falconer, M.D.,\nAsst. Director, Indian Health Services.\n\nCF\nExtract from report of Anthony McMillan,\ndated January 1, 1947 - Peigan Agency -\n\nOriginal on 75-116.\n\nSCHOOLS\n\nSACRED HEART SCHOOL\n\nThis school has been working under difficulties all through this quarter, the water situation having become serious early in the quarter, authority was granted for assistance to this school in the expense of hauling their water from the C.P.R. Tank; even with this assistance, I had to use all the available road money allowed to clear out the roads to the school so that the truck could move. This was followed later at the end of the quarter by sending out a gang of Indians to open up the roads again. I must say that the present principal with all the troubles he has had to face is handling his work admirably.\nJanuary 23rd., 1947.\n\nMr. A McMillan,\nIndian Agency,\nBrocket, Alberta.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nPlease accept this report of the electrical wiring of the Anglican Indian School, Brocket, Alberta.\n\nStorage Batteries.\n\nHaving learned from the attendant that the battery terminals had not been cleaned or tightened since they were assembled seven years ago, we proceeded in the same manner as at the Roman Catholic School. The connections were cleaner, tighter and less corroded because they were assembled more carefully and with lots of vaseline to prevent corrosion.\n\nThis set of batteries is in good condition, after seven years of service and will give good service for some time to come.\n\nBranch Circuits.\n\nAgain, many of these branch circuits were fused with 20 - 25 and 30 ampere fuses. I replaced these with the 15 ampere fuses available, and recommended purchasing a supply to complete the replacement, including the out buildings, as soon as possible.\n\nDrop Cords.\n\nWould recommend that all drop cords be replaced with new cord.\n\nOut Buildings.\n\nHave instructed the attendant to cut the line, now lying on ground, from pole where it lead to the barn, now burned.\nPage 2.\n\nAlso asked him to tie line to the insulators on one of the cross arms. High wind prevented us from doing this work while there.\n\nFire Alarm System.\n\nI checked this system and found the general system in good condition. The bell on the main floor and the one in the boy's dormitory were not operating. Have adjusted these bells and recommend a similar one be installed in the corridor of the basement.\n\nThis system is fed through a separate circuit from a portion of the battery of the plant. Again it might be well to consider installing a protected system, such as suggested in the Roman Catholic School report. However, this one is now in good working order.\n\nFire Escape Lights.\n\nPlease refer to Roman Catholic School report as the same condition exists in this school as there, except one light near one of the escapes here has a 7\u00bd watt red bulb in it. I make the same recommendation for this school, namely, that this matter be carefully considered.\n\nGenerator and Switchboard.\n\nAdjusted brush contacts and switch contacts, also cleaned armature. This plant has had excellent care and is good for some years yet.\n\nWhile there I also adjusted sump pump in boiler room and recommend frequent cleaning for basin in which pump sets.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nThe Southern Alberta Electric Ltd.,\n\n[Signature]\n\nService Dep't.\nSOUTHERN ALBERTA ELECTRIC\nLIMITED\n\n317 EIGHTH STREET SOUTH\nLETHBRIDGE\nALBERTA\n\nJanuary 22nd., 1947.\n\nMr. A. McMillan,\nIndian Agency,\nBrocket, Alberta,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nPlease accept this report of the electrical wiring of the Roman Catholic Indian School at Brocket, Alberta.\n\nTROUBLE: Explosion of glass envelope of electric light bulb in socket and subsequent heating of electrical wiring in that circuit.\n\nCAUSE #1 - Battery connections were loose, causing the line voltage to rise, due to generated voltage being impressed on the line, instead of on the batteries to charge same. This rise in voltage over 115 volts caused excessive heating of the bulb until it burst.\n\nWhen using batteries to crank diesel engine, there was audible arcing between jar lugs and straps, due to loose bolts and dirty lugs and straps.\n\nREMEDY: Cleaned all straps, lugs and bolts, coated each part with vaseline and reassembled cells, firmly tightening bolts.\n\nRECOMMENDATION: The plates of this set of Globalite GDL3 batteries are badly warped and disintegrated, due to too high a charging rate, or too high a discharge rate without generator operating, or both. As the economical operating life of these batteries is past, I would suggest they be traded in on a new set. Due to the amount of sediment in the jars, it is necessary to recharge them frequently, resulting in an added operating expense.\n\nWould also recommend cleaning, vaseline coating, and tightening of battery connections every six months. Five or six spare straps and a dozen\nReport Roman Catholic Indian School, Brootet, Alta.\n\nspare lead-coated bolts would insure continuous service, due to these lead-coated parts being easily stripped while assembling.\n\nCAUSE #2: Practically all branch circuits were fused with fuses in excess of 15 amperes. The majority were rated at 30 amperes. This did not protect the wiring as the fuses allowed current, in excess to the current carrying capacity of the wire, to flow through the circuit, thus causing the wire to heat and destroying the insulating covering of the wire.\n\nNo branch circuit of #14 copper wire should be fused with a fuse larger than 15 amperes. If these branch fuses had been rated at 15 amperes, then the short circuit in the socket, due to explosion of glass envelope of bulb, would have opened the circuit by blowing the fuse and thus protected the wire from overheating. The fuse found in overheated circuit was 30 amp.\n\nREMEDIY: Used my supply of spare 15 amp. fuses, as far as it went, to replace fuses of higher rating and requested prompt purchase of adequate supply of 15 Amp fuses to properly fuse all branch circuits, including out buildings.\n\nSUGGESTION: If a fuse burns out, replace it with another one of the same capacity. If second fuse burns out, immediately, then examine outlets and appliances, connected to this circuit, for visible defects. Should no apparent cause be found, then call a licensed electrician to remedy the trouble. When circuits are properly fused, loss of life and loss by fire are greatly reduced.\n\nWould also suggest that all drop cords, from ceiling outlet boxes, be replaced with new cord. The rubber insulation has dried out and is cracked when bent slightly. This poor insulation often causes a short circuit in a lamp socket, especially if handled frequently.\n\nFire Alarm System.\n\nTROUBLE: This system is not in use at the present time. From information received, I think some of the wiring in the walls is bare and when the wind blows hard air currents in the partitions cause to short circuit and ring the fire bells.\n\nSUGGESTION: Due to so many lives depending on this system for protection in case of fire, I recommend a complete new system be installed direct from the batteries, in BX cable, including proper tamper proof switches and bells. In any case the present system should be completely checked and made to operate if new system is not desired.\nPage 3.\n\nReport Roman Catholic Indian School, Brocket, Alta.\n\nFire Escape Lights\n\nWhile inspecting the building, I noticed no lights at the fire escape entrances, marked FIRE, EXIT or any other similar marking, or lights with red bulbs to indicate a fire escape. It is customary to run fire escape lights on a separate circuit direct from the battery and to use small red bulb in a socket over each exit or to use a lighted exit sign. This circuit is run in rigid conduit or BX cable. These lights are to burn all night and if ten watt red lamps are used, the total drain would be less than one hundred watts.\n\nI strongly recommend this installation be made as it might save many a heartache in case of a fire.\n\nGenerator And Switchboard.\n\nThis equipment was checked and found to be in good repair.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nThe Southern Alberta Electric Ltd.,\n\n[Signature]\n\nService Dept.\nIndian Affairs Branch Dept of Mines & Resources\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise that on one of my visits to the Sacred Heart School, the Principal called my attention to the fact that one of the Bulbs blew out, and burnt the socket. Later he came to this Office, and advised that again this had happened, and that the socket and wire were burning. In both cases there happened to be a member of the Staff in the room where this had happened.\n\nAs there is no Electrician in Banff Creek or Macleod, except Radio men, I went to Hutcheson Electric in Lethbridge, who recommended Southern Alberta Limitee, stating the Electrician at that place worked only on wiring etc of Buildings with their own small plants. I arranged for them to come out and check the trouble in the Sacred Heart School, and while there to check over the St Cyprians School; he made a verbal report to me before leaving, and asked him for reports on each School in writing, which he had now forwarded, and a copy of which I am enclosing with this letter.\n\nFor the information we have got I consider the cost very reasonable, and I understand that both School's are functioning very well, except for one fuse which has blown out.\n\nI feel that in this report we may have a chance to cut out the Fire Risks in Residential Schools, as in many cases myself included I considered a larger fuse as the best to put in while at this time adopting the largest fuse that should be used especially with the wiring which is a lot heavier. Otherwise the Bulb will blow and the wire over heat and burn. At both Schools the type of fuse was over that size in many cases when checked; and this may be possible in many of your Schools.\n\nAfter reading this Report I will be glad to be advised, as to what work you would consider should be done in these Establishments, especially as to the Fire Alarm system, and the installation of Red Lights.\n\nAnthony McCullough\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, February 8th, 1947.\n\nMr. A.

We have recently received a typical report from the Southern Alberta Electric Limited concerning conditions at two Indian residential schools in Pelican Agency. The principal reported to the Agent that twice recently there had been instances of bulbs blowing out and sockets and electric wiring burning. Fortunately, in both instances there happened to be a member of the staff in the room when this had happened. Therefore, Mr. Indian Agent McMillan, in view of the evident fire hazard, called in the above company for an emergency inspection. I attach a copy of the above company's reports on both these schools.\n\nWould it be possible to have an article prepared for a future issue of our magazine entitled \"The Care and Maintenance of the Electrical Plants in Residential Schools\" so that we may draw to the attention of all concerned the absolute necessity of careful maintenance and common sense in the use of the electrical plants provided.\nMemorandum to Surveys & Engineering. Feb. 8, 1947.\n\nIn the instance of these two schools we have requested Mr. Indian Agent McMillan to obtain estimates immediately upon the emergency repairs that will have to be carried out. It is felt that one of your engineers from Banff might visit these two schools in the near future to further report upon this situation.\n\nDirector\nOttawa, February 8th, 1947.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nSURVEY AND ENGINEERING\n\nSacred Heart Indian Residential School,\nPelican Agency, Brocket, Alberta.\n\nOn 19 December, 1945, we wrote you concerning the drilling of a well to provide water at the above school.\n\nAt that time the school management made a determined effort to find water and at first their efforts seemed successful. On January 8, 1946, we were informed that the new well could supply about 15,000 gallons of water per day at this school.\n\nOn March 4, 1946, the Indian Agent reported that they were very well satisfied with the water supply after three months usage of the well. Attached is a report submitted by the Indian Agent on this well.\n\nThen in October of 1946 we received reports that the water in the well had ceased to pump sufficient water to carry the school. We were forced to provide for a truck and tank to run water from the Canadian Pacific Railway water tank nearby. It was also necessary to allow the children to return to their homes from Friday evening to Sunday evening in order to conserve the water supply. It was hoped that this shortage of water was only temporary as seventeen links of a cow chain were found in the well by the driller when he made an emergency check. However, this has not been found to be so and we are faced with a serious water shortage.\n\nIt would be appreciated if we could have a report upon this situation so that we can decide either (a) to dig another well at this school, or (b) to provide a new tank truck for hauling of water from the Canadian Pacific Railway tank.\nMemorandum to Surveys & Engineering. Feb. 8, 1947.\n\nWith regard to (a) above, we enclose a letter which has been received from William W. Maughan, well driller of Lethbridge, Alberta. Mr. Maughan has been employed by the Department of National Health and Welfare in digging a well to provide water for the Paigan Indian Hospital. Apparently water was discovered and was reported on January 21st, 1947, to be rising to one hundred feet from the surface from a well of approximately two hundred feet.\n\nDirector.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nFebruary 10th 1947\n\nTo the Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa.

While the result of any well drilling that may be done cannot be foretold with certainty, we are still of the opinion expressed in our memorandum of January 13th, 1944, that the only good prospect of securing a satisfactory and permanent water supply for this school is by drilling a well approximately 1200 feet deep and the cost of which would be in the order of from $10,000 to $13,000. Further consideration might be given to this proposal.\n\nOur view is that the experience with the well drilled in December 1945 and which after providing an adequate supply for some months then failed to do so, confirms our opinion that comparatively shallow wells of only 200 to 300 feet in depth only tap small pockets of water-containing formations with the result that the supply therefrom is largely exhausted in a few months.\n\nIt is suggested that no further drilling of such shallow wells be done for the present. The melting of the snow in the next few months may considerably increase the amount of water available from the well drilled in December 1945.\n\nIn view of the existing situation, however, we would suggest that a new tank truck be secured for hauling water from the Canadian Pacific Railway tank at Brocket or elsewhere.\n\nDirector.\n**The Gurney Foundry Company, Limited**\n\n**HEATING & COOKING APPLIANCES**\n\n**INVOICE**\n\n**TOURNOO (9)**\n\n**SHIP WHEN**\n\n**F.O.B.**\n\n**OUR ORDER NO.**\n\n**INVOICE DATE**\n\n**S - 710**\n\n**VIA**\n\n**Jan. 21st, 1947**\n\n**Collect C.P.R.**\n\n**CAR INITIAL AND NO.**\n\n**Same**\n\n**Sacred Heart Ind.

This will confirm my wire of even date as follows:\n\n\"Sacred Heart School Crockett still experiencing grave water shortage which will inspect Friday Stop Driller offers to pull two hundred fifty feet using old well casing and if over five gallons per minute flow asks $600.00 and if under asks $250.00 Stop Am meeting driller at school Stop Wire if expenditure approved writing.\"\n\nThe principal of the school, Father La France, together with Father Charron, principal of the Blood R.C. School, interviewed me today when they stated that the water supply at the Peigan Hospital was very poor and it was difficult to haul that quantity which is required over the roads, which have now turned to a sea of water where there was formerly drifted snow. They expected even worse roads when thawing commences.\n\nThey made two suggestions to try and improve the water supply:\n\n1. To employ the services of Mr. W. W. Maughan, an experienced driller, from Lethbridge.\n\n2. To run a trench laterally to a spring a few hundred yards from the school in order to ascertain where the water may be going that formerly was piped and used at this institution.\n\nMr. Maughan, who has recently drilled a well at the Peigan Hospital, and who is the most reliable and efficient driller that is known to us in this part of the country, is confident that he can secure water near the school and not far from the existing well which has gone dry. He has made the offer that is mentioned in the wire, i.e., to pull the casing out of the well that has gone dry and to use it in a new hole which he would drill to depth, if necessary, of 200 feet and would supply this material and his labour, and if he got more than 5 gallons per minute he would ask the sum of $600.00, and if it was under or a dry hole, he would only ask $250.00. In other words, he is offering to drill a well for less than ordinary cost if we were supplying the casing, and if he fails to get the required flow, he is only asking for his out of pocket expenses. We have confidence in this driller and believe that there is no alternative but to try and get another well.\nWith regard to the second suggestion, the Rev. Fathers had been complaining about this spring, the nature of the water and strate and the cribbing, which at one time or another had been put in and about the spring. This led them to believe that the water, which formerly flowed into the pipe which led to the school, has been mostly diverted along other channels, and that at right angles to the flow would undoubtedly find these channels, if any existed. The principal asked for authority to hire Indians to dig the trench at a cost not exceeding $75.00 to $100.00. Our experience with springs would lead us to believe that this was good business. I am going to the Blood Reserve tomorrow and from there to the Bigan Agency on the 28th, when this will be inspected. In my wildest dreams did not ask for authority to dig the channel, but if I can be persuaded that it is a good idea while I am at the school, I am going to assume that the cost will be approved. There are numerous springs at various places on this Reserve near the schools and near the Agency, which, in my opinion, will flow with fairly definite consistency if the flow is properly directed by cribbing, and I consider it worth while to investigate, even at the cost of trenching.\n\nMr. Maughen's drilling outfit is now at the Agency, and he can commence work at the school immediately.\n\nA further report will be made after our investigation is completed.\n\nG. H. Gooderham,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\n\nGHG:HM\nOttawa, February 28, 1947.\n\nG. H.

Driller offers to drill 250 feet using old well casing and if over 5 gallons per minute flow asks $500.00 and if under 5 asks $250.00. Am meeting driller at school.

You may encounter difficulty rusted well casing.\"\n\nYour letter 116-45-14 of February 25 has just arrived. It is noted that due to an error in transmission the first quotation received from Mr. Maughan was $600.00 rather than the $500.00 quoted in the original telegram. However, approval is given for the expenditure of this larger sum.\nThe Department also concurs in your action in digging a trench at a cost not to exceed $100.00 in order to run a lateral line to a spring a few hundred yards from the school.\n\nWe will expect to hear further from you in this regard in the near future. In the meantime tenders are about to be called for the supply of a water truck at this school.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nRe: Water Supply - Sacred Heart Residential School,\nFeigen Reserve.\n\nYour letter of February 28th to hand.\n\nOn that date I visited the school in company with the Indian Agent and was met there by the principal and Mr. Maughan, well driller. The water supply for this school was subject to discussion and it was learned that at the present there is a small intermittent supply from the old well and the spring, but that a great deal of the water is being hauled in tanks.\n\nMr. Maughan stated that he had made several attempts to increase the flow in the existing well by removal of foreign matter but had not been successful. He said that it was his belief that there had been an attempt to pump water from the well faster than it was coming in, and that in his experience, when this is done in certain formations, there is a likelihood for the well to be closed and the water close down. In this we concur, as we have encountered the same experience elsewhere. He has drilled three wells within a short distance of the school during the past few years, and each of these had produced a flow in excess of three gallons per minute, and it was his contention, in which we agree, that if the pumping was limited to less than the flow, that the well would be good for an indefinite time.\n\nHe stated that he was prepared to drill a few hundred yards to the west of the present well to a depth of 200 feet, and if the flow did not exceed three gallons per minute, he would ask to be paid only $250.00 for his work. Should the water flow be in excess of that amount, he would then set his rig over the old well and try to remove the pipe and casing and put it down in the new well. The formation is such that all wells have been drilled to water without inserting casing as the drill went down. When questioned as to the possibility of pulling the casing, he stated that it has only been done less than two years and that he had inserted it himself. His experience of five years in the oil fields led him to believe that it would be reasonable to expect that oil could be removed intact. He had the tools to do so. Failing however to pull it out, he was not prepared to supply casing at his own expense, but could supply it at the present cost. The pipe is 3\" and really too big, but there is now no\nIndian Affairs Branch - 2 - March 4/47\n\nalternative but to use it as any size is almost impossible to secure. The pumping, of course, will be controlled by a gearing of the pump.\n\nThe site was viewed and the general lay of the land explained to us. It appeared to be a reasonable gamble that he will strike water by drilling to a depth of not over 200 feet, because water was struck in the other wells at between 120 and 190 feet. Mr. Maughan was then instructed to proceed on the terms that he had stated, and should now be drilling as his outfit was at the Indian Agency.\n\nWith regard to the channeling of the springs, I learned that these are not deep-seated but surface springs that rise and fall with the amount of precipitation. There was no advantage in channeling.\n\nG.H. Gooderham,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\n\nRHG:RM\nOttawa, March 13th, 1947.\n\nMr. A.M.

School,\nBrocket, Alberta,\nMarch 31, 1947.\n\nMr. Bernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn a few days you will receive the report on the well drilling at the Sacred Heart Indian Res. School from your Agent Mr. Ant. MacMillan.\n\nI am sorry to say that we have not met with success. Not a trickle of water was found.\n\nHence, this means that we will be obliged to haul water again, which has been very costly for the School, although your department helps me with a grant of one hundred dollars a month.\n\nDuring the past year, as you will see in Mr. Scott, the Treasury Auditor's report, the truck has cost us over $500.00 in repairs only. Much repairs would be actually needed on our old truck, but I am reluctant to have it repaired, as your department has promised to send me a new three ton truck. Please tell me if it will soon be coming. I have had two offers of new trucks from Agents in Lethbridge and Pincher Creek which I naturally refused not having the authority to make purchase myself or through your Agent Mr. MacMillan.\n\nI have requested a few weeks ago for sheeting, towels, soap etc., please tell me if I can hope that the required items will be forthcoming or if they will not be allotted by the Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. Father M. Lafrance, C.M.I.\nPRINCIPAL\nOttawa, April 8, 1947.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT.\n\nWith reference to our memorandum of January 16th, addressed to the Acting Deputy Minister enclosing a requisition for a truck to carry water to the Sacred Heart Residential School. We have just received a letter from the Principal which reads in part as follows:\n\n\"Please tell me if the new truck will soon be coming. I have had to offers of new trucks from agents in Lethbridge and Pincher Creek, which I naturally refused not having authority either to purchase myself or from your agent Mr. MacMillan\".\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, April 8, 1947.\n\nReverend M. Lafrance, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nSacred Heart Residential School,\nBrocket, Alberta.\n\nDear Father Lafrance:\n\nWe have your letter of the 31st ultimo but have not yet received the report regarding the well drilling at the Sacred Heart School.\n\nThe Purchasing Branch has been requested to secure the new truck but I am bringing to their attention your statement that a truck might be purchased either from Lethbridge or Pincher Creek.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, April 11th, 1947.\n\nMr. A. McMillan, Indian Agent,\nBrocket, Alberta.\n\nWith reference to the attached two accounts, please state the date of the letter of authority authorizing you to incur the expenditure.\n\nThe mere inclusion of an item in the estimates is not sufficient authority.\n\nYou are also aware of the purchasing regulations requiring all purchases to be made through our Purchasing Branch.\n\nBernard F.

The Rev. Principal, Father La France, states that there is sufficient painting material on hand to do a good two-coat job.\n\nThis work should be done during the summer, preferably during vacation. The cost is estimated at $600.00.\n\nAs there are no Indians capable of doing this work properly, the services of qualified painters should be obtained. There is a very good painting firm in the town of Cardston, who will do the work at a reasonable cost.\n\nWill authority for this expenditure be granted please.\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\n\nMAY 27 1947\n\n$650 in estimates\nOttawa, May 28th, 1947.\n\nMr. G.H. Gooderham, Inspector of Indian Agencies, Calgary, Alberta.\n\nSacred Heart Residential School\nPelican Reserve.\n\nIn our 1947-48 estimates, the sum of $650 was included for the purpose of general repairs required at the above school.\n\nWe have already expended the sum of $282.50 for the drilling of a well at this school. Would you please advise the Principal that the remaining sum can be expended in the manner in which he and the Agent would recommend.\n\nBernard P. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise that this week I visited the Sacred Heart Residential School with view of checking over with the Principal the necessary repairs to the above school.\n\nWe had all his points ready and we checked over the different repair jobs which he wished to do, and I have put them in rotation as to what was his first second and so on choices.\n\nSince making this inspection I have received a copy of a letter from Mr. Neary Superintendent of Welfare and Training to Mr. Gooderham, in which the sum of $250.00 has been allowed this school from which already has been paid out $262.50.\n\nHowever, I am placing the request before you so that if there are any items which will be taken care of outside of the estimates, I can be advised so that the Estimates for next year may be made accordingly.\n\n1. Bake Oven.\n   Movement of Bakery equipment, Oven Racks and cups.\n   Board from present location to the Ice House not now being used, will mean dismantling and rebuilding oven, and putting door & window in Ice House.\n\n   Remarks. Any one who has visited this school will realize the heat in this small room where you can hardly move, and if more people are in at once it is almost impossible to open the door, this is not large enough if girls are going to be taught baking.\n   A dough Mixer of 1 Sack capacity.\n\n2. Boys Dormitory.\n   Laying of the Floor in the boys dormitory,\n   Flooring for this floor was purchased late last year and the labor is all that would be needed, appr. price $250.00\n\n3. Refrigeration.\n   A Frigidaire of the walk in variety for the kitchen, possible to purchase at $700.00 through War Assets U.S.A.\n\n4. Reservoir.\n   A 10,000 Gallon Reservoir needed to carry the school over during a severe period when roads are impassable. This will be a very expensive project, but with the present outlook would be very close to a necessity.\n\n5. Sewing Machines.\n   Four sewing Machines for use in the sewing room approximate cost $250.00.\n\n6. Laundry.\n   1 Gasoline washer, to save use of barrel washer, when only a small wash needed $160.00\n   1 Small Mangle. 35\".\n\n7. Kitchen.\n   1 Kitchen Stove with fire Box in middle of stove, capable of handling 15-20 people. Present fire Box at end will only heat one oven.\n   Vacuum cleaner approximately $160.00\n   17 Lineal Yards Battle ship Linoleum for Kitchen\n   \" \" \" \" \" \" \" \" for Refectory.\nThe question of the Crash Doors between the Girl's Dormitory and the Main Building, recommended by the Architect is now being done by help arranged for by the School, at a small cost, this has not been done to date owing to the inability to have a Contractor come out while school was on, and shortage of time that the job would take.\n\nA letter by the Inspector to B.F. Neary Esqr has come to hand recommending the painting of the Sacred Heart School outside, on the basis of the School having been given 1 can each year by the Principals that they had 50 gallons Linseed Oil, and 50 Cans White Lead approximately 25 lbs. The cost as quoted in the Inspector's letter for labor would be about $800.00. Will this be done separate to the amount allowed in the Estimates.\n\nWhile there I looked over the Outbuildings, and I am sorry to say that the paint has disappeared by all gone on these buildings except where the outside walls are sheltered from the wind and rain. This will have to be taken care of before long or the wood will start to crack.\n\nI have mentioned the above points as if the funds are not available to keep up the work on the Schools, I would like to be advised, as I intend to make a complete survey, and place everything necessary on the Estimates for the year 1948-1949.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOTTAWA, June 28th 1947\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nRe: Addition to Sacred Heart, Brocket School.\n\nAttention: Mr. Phelan.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from Reverend Father M. Lafrance, O.M.I., principal of the above school in which he states that of the seventy pupils now in attendance, only one will be discharged at the end of the school year and that thirty are on the waiting list for admission next September. This will mean hundred children on that Reserve, who are of school age, thirty of whom will receive no education at all.\n\nAn addition to the school, somewhat similar to that which the principal of St. Philips school built, would be quite in order and I hope that provisions will be made for it in next year's estimates. I understand that the water situation will be solved and if this information is correct, I cannot see why the school could not be enlarged, as requested by Reverend Father Lafrance.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nC.

This should not be so difficult to obtain as $60.00 per month is already paid in some schools for a Night Watchman.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nsgd Maurice La France.\nIndian Affairs Branch Dept of Mines & Resources Ottawa.\n\nAttention B.F. Neary Esqr.\n\nI beg to enclose a copy of a letter received from Father La France Principal of Sacred Heart School Swocket, which speaks for itself.\n\nIt would seem that he has the information that some other schools are receiving $60.00 for their Night Watchman and asking for the same rate here.\n\nI am making no comment on this matter, as if this allowed at one school it will immediately be asked for by the other.\n\nAnthony McNally\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, October 22, 1947.\n\nMr. Anthony McMillan, Indian Agent,\nBrocket, Alberta.\n\nWe have your letter of the 17th instant with reference to the allowance for the night watchman at the Sacred Heart Residential School.

Goodenham,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nCalgary, Alberta.\n\nSacred Heart Indian Residential School,\n\nReference your 116-45-14 of January 9 -\n\nIt is noted from your report that a new cook stove is needed at this school. Authority for its purchase will depend largely on the availability of funds as we are drawing close to the end of our fiscal year.\n\nYour comments concerning the Sister Superior and other members of the staff have been noted and it is of course similar to conditions which exist at certain other Indian residential schools.\n\nYour comments on the water situation have been sent to the Lands and Development Services Branch with the request that they investigate your two recommendations. It would seem evident that water must be secured at this school if it is not to continue suffering in the future. Your report will do much to bring this matter to a head and to obtain a definite decision from the Lands and Development Services Branch, who are our advisers in matters of this nature.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, January 15, 1946.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR,\nLANDS AND DEVELOPMENT SERVICES,\n\nWater Supply - Sacred Heart Residential School,\nPigeon Indian Reserve, Alberta -\n\nAs you are probably aware, we have been experiencing difficulty for a long time with the water supply at this school. Your files will reveal the efforts that have been made in the past to obtain water. At the present time we are providing a truck and paying a driver $100.00 a month to draw water for this school.\n\nWe have now received a full report from Mr. G. H. Gooderham, our Regional Supervisor of Indian Agencies for the province of Alberta. In his report Mr. Gooderham makes the following comments:\n\n\"The water situation has not improved; the local well and spring do not supply sufficient for the needs of the institution and some water must be hauled from Brocket. The road has been improved, and the truck supplied for this purpose has got through without difficulty so far this winter.\n\n\"During the fiscal year 1947/48 the branch will have paid out $4,090.00 and the school authorities $350.00, either to hunt for or supply water for this institution. That amount, of course, includes the purchase of a truck and an allowance of $100.00 a month to operate. That\n\nEXD.\nis a great deal of money and would pay for a lot of prospecting for water. Therefore, it is recommended that consideration be given -\n\n1. to find the source of the spring near the school, and if it is sufficient, to control it and direct it to the institution.\n\n2. or, drill a deep well at the summit where the spring originates.\n\n\"It will be long time economy to be prepared to spend at least $4,000.00 or $5,000.00.\n\n\"As to the future, this school cannot be operated indefinitely at this point without water. There are already between fifteen and twenty Peigan children of school age, which the two schools cannot accommodate, and the majority of them are of the Roman Catholic faith. I would not recommend the enlargement of the present residential school, certainly not so long as it has not got a sufficient supply of water. Even if a day school is erected on the Peigan Reserve, this school still will have the water problem. It is therefore our considered opinion that early in 1948 we must be prepared to hunt for water. If it is eventually found that water cannot be secured, this school should be abandoned or moved.\"\n\nIn view of your previous technical experience in trying to locate water at this school in the past, we would appreciate your comments on the two recommendations which Mr. Goeller has made above.\n\nDirector.\nMemorandum\n\nRe: Water Supply - Sacred Heart Residential School, Peigan Indian Reserve, Alberta.\n\nReferring to your memorandum of January 17th we have now received the following from Mr. J.S. Stewart of the Geological Survey under date of January 26th, 1948:\n\n\"We have no detailed maps of the topography and geology of the region in the vicinity of the school.\n\nThe maps available, however, show that the school is probably at least 500 feet above river level and that the bedrock immediately underlying is the Porcupine Hills Sandstone. Now some of these sandstone beds should be sufficiently permeable to carry water and should be sufficiently widespread to carry water from the river to the school. Water should enter such sandstones where they crop up in the river bed a few miles to the west. The water could come from either the Oldman or Waterton River and I should think a well 600 feet deep would get sufficient water for your purpose. As far as we know at present such a well could be drilled as close to the school as you wish, in fact the lower the elevation of the surface the less the depth will probably be to water.\n\nWith regard to the spring, an examination of the geologic and topographic map shows no suggestion of a large enough gathering ground to constantly supply a spring with a sufficient quantity of water for your purpose.\"\n\nThe Indian Agent appears to have been drilling for water. A copy of his report of December 13, 1945 indicates that seven wells have been drilled and one, drilled to a depth of 500 feet, has supplied part of the water required by the School.\n\nIf water is available at a depth of 600 feet it might only be necessary to continue drilling one of the present wells until water is secured.\n\nChief Engineer.\n\nR. A. Gibson, Esq.,\nDirector,\nLands & Development Services Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, February 3, 1948.\n\nMr. Hoey\n\nRE: Water Supply - Sacred Heart Residential School, Peigan Indian Reserve, Alberta.\n\nI am attaching herewith Chief Engineer Mills' memorandum of the 30th ultimo which contains information received from Dr. J. S. Stewart of the Geological Survey in reply to your request of the 15th ultimo for advice as to further steps which could be taken to improve the water supply at this point.\n\nWe place a good deal of confidence in the opinion expressed by Dr. Stewart whose suggestion that the drilling be extended to 600 feet is probably the best advice that can be given to you.\n\nAttach.\n\nDirector.\nAirmil Calgary, January 26th, 1948.\n\nV. Meek, Esq., Controller, Dominion Water & Power Bureau,\nOttawa.\n\nRe: Water Supply for Sacred Heart School,\nPelican Indian Reserve, near Brocket, Alta.\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 26th instant re the above subject and in reply wish to comment on Mr. Gooderham's resolutions and make suggestions as follows.\n\nMr. Gooderham's first recommendation is to find the source of the spring near the school. In reference to this suggestion, our staff here have practically no experience in the tracing of a spring to its source and we are very doubtful, even if found, that it would tap any appreciable amount of water.\n\nRegarding Mr. Gooderham's second recommendation, we believe that drilling a well anywhere in the area is nothing but a gamble and, before doing anything in that line, we strongly recommend that the best possible advice be first obtained.\n\nThis office advises that Mr. T.S. Miller, Chief Engineer, contact Mr. G.F. Hamelin, Manager, Western Water Wells Ltd., Donegal Mansions, Calgary, Alberta, direct and obtain his advice before incurring any expense.\n\nWe believe that if Mr. Hamelin, who is a geologist and well known to Dr. Hume, could be persuaded to make a trip to the area and submit his recommendation, it would be well worth while. We are endeavouring to contact Mr. Hamelin who left town yesterday for Leduc, where I understand he is drilling a well for the town, but so far we have been unsuccessful. He is due back tonight and immediately we contact him we shall advise you by airmail.\n\nSince writing the above, we have contacted Mr. Hamelin and he advises me that he is prepared to make a trip to the area, review the situation, and submit his recommendations together with an estimate of cost. He also tells me that he has visited the area and previously submitted recommendations to the Dept. of Indian Affairs. He is waiting now to hear from a bid on work at Waterton Lakes which he submitted at the request of the Department and he said it would be an ideal time to do both jobs.\n\n(Sgd) W.T. McFarlane,\n\nfor O.E. Hoover,\nDistrict Chief Engineer.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nRe: Water Supply,\nSacred Heart Residential School,\nPelican Indian Reserve, Alberta.\n\nReferring to your memorandum of January 17th and further to our recent memorandum quoting a memorandum from the Geological Survey, we are in receipt of the following from Mr. Meek under date of January 30, 1948.\n\n\"A copy of your letter of January 22, was forwarded to Mr. O.H. Hoover, District Chief Engineer, Calgary, with a request that he comment on the two resolutions advanced by Mr. Gooderham and also make any alternate suggestion which might insure a reliable supply of water for the school.\n\nI am enclosing a copy of Mr. Hoover's reply.\n\nMr. Hoover suggests that you immediately communicate with Mr. G.F. Hamelin, Manager, Western Water Wells Ltd., Donegal Mansions, Calgary, with the view of obtaining his expert advice.\"\n\nAlso attached in duplicate is copy of the letter from Mr. Hoover to Mr. Meek dated January 28th, 1948. You will note the recommendation to contact Mr. G.F. Hamelin, Manager, Western Water Wells Ltd., Donegal Mansions, Calgary, for advice as to procedure in securing water for the above school.\n\nWe await your further instructions.\n\nEnds.\n\nR.A.

Mills,\nChief Engineer,\nEngineering & Construction Division,\nLands & Development Services Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear sir:\n\nRe Water Supply - Sacred Heart Residential School,\nPeigan Indian Reserve, Alberta.\n\nThis will acknowledge receipt of your Airmail letter of February 17th, and as you requested I made a trip to the School and discussed the situation, and walked over the area, although it was covered with deep drifts of snow, and herewith submit a report with an estimate of cost.\n\n1. The existing well and spring\n\nThe only well at present available for the use of the School is that one to the south-west drilled to a depth of 236 feet and at that time had a static level of 158 feet. The present setting is 250 feet and the well is only started pumping 3 to 4 hours every few days. The pumping equipment is gasoline driven and the well is connected by buried pipe line to the School. The well, originally, at the time it was drilled, had a reported capacity of 5 T.G.F.M. Its present status is nothing more than a seepage well.\n\nThe spring has been a constant source of small supply, except in the winter months of December, January and February. The collecting reservoir could not be examined as it was completely covered with snow. The School was hauling water from the C.P.R. reservoir at Brocket. The tank on the truck was draining into a hose alongside the road and this was leading the water into the reservoir which it reached the School buildings. The C.P.R. reservoir at Brocket is 5 miles due west from the School. This reservoir is filled by water from the Oldman River which is approximately 1 mile distant. The spring is a type of gravity spring which I would classify as a valley-depression spring. A low range of hills exists immediately to the south with hard low range of hills exists immediately to the south with hard sandstone ledges outcropping near their top and the geologist stated that this sandstone outcrops also near where the spring issues. There is a shallow coulee below this point of issue in which a stockwatering dam has been constructed. There was considerable water in the dam at the time of my visit. It is believed that there is a shallow mantle of till material overlying these low hills that act as a limited storage area for ground water. This groundwater could also have seeped into the top of the underlying bedrock. The spring as it exists increases...\nand decreases with the moisture supply, and also there is a suspicion that some water escapes the impounding reservoir and gets into the dam below.\n\nThere was a reported No. 2 spring which I estimated would be 2000 feet or more westerly. It could not be examined because of snow and the Principal stated that there was little more than a damp spot in the summer season.\n\n2. Other Sources of Water in the Area\n\nThe Oldman River which supplies the C.P.R. reservoir at Brocket is a dependable source of water, but not considered safe for drinking supply unless treated. Its distance from the School, or even the distance of the C.P.R. reservoir are too great to recommend these as suitable.\n\nSt. Cyprien Residential School, which is approximately 3 miles westerly is reported to have a well in the basement that flows, and the quality of the water quite suitable. The depth of the well was reported as 200 feet.\n\nThe bedrock formations in this area are reported to all have a gentle east dip. The bedrock formation in which the aquifer occurs at 200 feet at St. Cyprien School apparently has changed 3 miles to the east, or has been faulted, as the well drilled to a depth of 544 feet at Sacred Heart School should have encountered this aquifer. Apparently it did not. Due to this apparent condition of the bedrock formation that underlies the School it is not recommended that drilling be undertaken to depths greater than this reported well of 544 feet.\n\n3. Recommendations\n\nDevelopment of the No. 1 spring area be undertaken by means of a number of shallow drilled wells. That such drilling be undertaken immediately above the existing spring and into the bedrock for a total of 50 feet. It is believed that possibly 6-8 wells may be drilled on that area containing the spring, with a spacing of between 200 and 300 feet. Should small supplies be encountered it is believed that they could readily be piped and possibly by gravity, to the existing impounding reservoir.\n\nShould this fail to satisfactorily augment the existing supply it is suggested that a well be drilled west of the School toward St. Cyprien School at some location about 1 mile east of the St. Cyprien well. Should a well be located at depth of not greater than 250 feet of similar quality and be artesian the Principal of Sacred Heart states such a well would be of considerable benefit to Indian families in that neighborhood. It is then suggested that a similar well be located 1 mile further east, making this 1 mile to the west of the Sacred Heart School. Should a similar well be encountered at this location consideration might then be given to utilizing this supply by means of either a buried pipe line or just a shallow buried water line. If the well is not artesian and the fall sufficient such a well location might serve with additional storage reservoirs at the buildings. Should the first proposed drilled well to 250 feet be dry, or insufficient, then no second drilled well is recommended.\n4. Estimate of drilling costs:\n\n- Mobilization of drilling equipment, trailer accommodation for crew and well casing: $200.00\n- Drilling an estimated 150 feet in the area of #1 spring @ $4.00 a foot: $600.00\n- Well casing for an estimated 3 wells 150 ft. of 5\" steel casing @ 2.00 ft.: $300.00\n- Demobilization of equipment and return to Calgary: $200.00\n\nTotal: $1300.00\n\nDrilling a proposed well 2 miles westerly:\n- 250 ft. @ $5.50 a foot: $75.00\n- Well casing 350' of 5\" steel casing @ $2.00 a foot: $700.00\n- 30 feet of 6\" outer casing at surface @ $3.00 a foot: $90.00\n- Pump testing for capacity, if necessary 24 hours @ $3.00 an hour: $72.00\n\nTotal: $1537.00\n\nFor the drilling of a second well similar to the above, 1 mile west of the School: $1557.00\n\nDrilling equipment could be made available within 1 month if instructed to undertake work at this site.\n\nThe estimate of drilling cost for the drilling at the spring area would be reduced by the cost of well casing, or $300.00, if insufficient water were encountered to justify leaving the casing and making it a well, or wells.\n\nThe drilling of this spring area may produce additional small quantities of water that still does not satisfactorily secure the School water supply.\n\nThis report is therefore submitted for your consideration and the account, in 5 copies, to cover its expense.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd.) D. F. Hemelin\nD. F. Hemelin,\nManager.\nMemorandum:\n\nRe: Water Supply - Sacred Heart Residential School, Peigan Indian Reserve - Alberta\n\nReferring to the memorandum from Indian Affairs dated February 12th, 1948, Mr. Hamelin was requested to examine the situation and submit recommendations for securing a satisfactory water supply for the school, together with an estimate of cost.\n\nWe have now received a report from Mr. Hamelin dated February 24th, duplicate copies of which are attached herewith. The recommendation is to drill three wells within the area of the spring, each of which is to go down fifty feet into bedrock. Should these not produce sufficient water Mr. Hamelin suggests exploratory drilling in an endeavour to tap the aquifer which supplies the St. Cyprien School. He recommends a well be driven between the St. Cyprien and Sacred Heart Schools, which are one mile apart and about one mile from the well supplying the former. If successful, another well is proposed to be drilled one more mile nearer the Sacred Heart School which would still be one mile away. There can be no guarantee that water will be found in sufficient quantity to meet fully the requirements of the Sacred Heart School.\n\nYou will observe that the estimated cost of developing the spring area is $1300.00 and the cost of each well to tap the St. Cyprien aquifer is estimated at $1537.00. It is of course evident from the details of the estimates that the stated costs only cover the development of the spring area only and if a suitable supply is found, additional costs will probably be necessary for delivery to the School.\n\nAttached hereto for transmission to the Indian Affairs Branch for payment are four copies of an account from Western Water Wells Limited for $150.00 to cover cost of the inspection and report.\n\nChief Engineer.\n\nEncls.\n\nR.

Gibson, Esq.,\nDirector,\nLands & Development Services Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nAttention: Superintendent of Education\n\nre: Sacred Heart Indian Residential School\n\nAnswering yours of the 15th instant, it is recommended that a supplementary item of $14,000.00 be placed in the estimates for the erection of a day school, or the acquisition of other property which would care for all school children on this reserve.\n\nNo additional expenditure should be made at the Sacred Heart School until there is sufficient water. There are three alternatives:\n\n1. The aforementioned classroom block.\n\n2. The removal of this school to a new site, to wit, the R.C.A.F. airport, MacLeod.\n\n3. A day school.\n\nThe present building is not sufficiently large to accommodate 30 more resident pupils. Therefore, if a school block was erected, some of these pupils must attend as day pupils and this must be seriously considered if it is found the only alternative.\n\nG. H.

M. Lefrancois, Rev. P.A. Charron and Mr. Superintendent Ragan, the following were considered, but in the order given:\n\n1. Bldg. #3 - Officers' Mess. 90' x 24'\n2. \" #34 \"Hostel\" Bldg. 80' x 26'\n3. \" #13 Stores. 100' x 30'\n\nThe first of these buildings if erected over a full basement would provide ample space, with adjustments in the main building, for a resident pupilage of about 120, a figure which will be reached in about five years' time. Present attendance is 68. About thirty more should be enrolled next September. Classes are organized as follows:\n\n| Beginners | I | II | III | IV | V | VI | VII | VIII | Total |\n|-----------|---|----|-----|----|---|----|-----|------|-------|\n| Boys      | 4 | 1  | 9   | 0  | 1 | 6  | 1    |      | 25    |\n| Girls     | 4 | 3  | 6   | 8  | 3 | 3  | 4    | 1    | 40    |\n| Total     | 8 | 4  | 15  | 14 | 9 | 9  | 4    | 1    | 68    |\n\nSister Lewis\n\nIt is recommended that when the attendance approaches 100 there should be four teachers.\n\nThe two classrooms presently in use would become:\nJunior Room (small) - bedrooms for staff.\nSenior Room (large) - chapel.\n\nPresent chapel to become sewing and allied arts room.\nPresent sewing room to become additional girls' dormitory.\nPresent library room to become additional girls' recreation room.\n(The outlook is for an increased number of girls.)\n\nFurther boys may be absorbed by using double-decker bunks.\nThe added building would allow three, perhaps four classrooms on the main floor. The basement would allow for a large dining-room-auditorium plus an enlarged laundry.\n\nThe overall cost should not exceed the figures suggested by Mr. Goodenham. It could be less.\n\nAfter extensive investigations by myself I had a conference at Cancher Creek with Mr. Agent McMillan, Rev. Principal Lafreniere and the local Alberta school Inspector, Mr. James A McKay. They confirm my views in the following matters:\n\n1. It is best to continue a centralized school on the present site using existing facilities and adding thereto.\n2. The present outlook for increasing attendance on a day-pupil system is not promising.\n3. If the water situation does not worsen (and it may improve) no difficulty should arise.\n4. The number of teachers should be increased.\n\nWe advise that although all unsold buildings are for the moment \"frozen\" negotiations should go forward immediately.\n\nC.A.T.

I would estimate an outside amount of $9,000 for purchasing and moving.\n\nI have been trying to get some estimate for the cost of construction of cement basements for these buildings, but have not succeeded. Mr. Clark and I are in agreement that the buildings purchased and used as classroom blocks should be set on basements.\n\nWe are also in total agreement that the solution to the school problem on the Pelican Reserve is classroom blocks at both residential schools. If you concur and can finance it, it is suggested that you make application for the two buildings at the Pearce Airport. I believe this is done through the War Assets Corporation, Montreal.\n\nG. H.
