On the 26th ult. the watch and the money were placed in a box by his mother, who locked it and kept the key. She had occasion to go out, and when she returned she missed her son. The following morning the box was found to have been broken open and the watch and the money were gone. The boy did not return, so the matter was reported to the police, and in due course the lad was arrested at Exeter, Devon. His explanation was that he had thrown the watch and the purse into the canal, and the money he had spent. He had treated two other boys to Bristol, and he himself had gone on to Exeter. The boy's parents told the magistrate that for the last four years their son had given them a deal of trouble, for he had stolen whatever he could lay hands upon. They desired he should go to some institution, but if that could not be done then that he should be sent to prison to see if that would cure him. The prisoner said a bigger boy went up to his parents' room with him, and he showed him the box, and he broke it open. He (the prisoner) did not want him to take the watch, but he would do so. The lad kept possession of the money, and at Exeter he sent him (prisoner) into a butcher's shop, and while there the lad ran off and left him. Mr. Hopkins said he was unable to send the prisoner to any institution. He sentenced him to fourteen days' hard labour.\n\nYOUTHFUL HIGHWAYMEN.\u2014The Bolton magistrates were occupied on Saturday in investigating charges of burglary against four youths, named Fielding, Rawcliffe, Hamer, and Ratclive. Fielding, who was arrested on a haystack with revolvers in his pockets, was also accused of shooting. Fielding, through being infatuated with pernicious publications, had persuaded his companions to form a gang of \"highwaymen,\" armed them with stolen revolvers and cartridges, and advised them to waylay people and shoot and rob them. Whilst attempting burglary he was caught by a constable, whom he fired at but missed. He visited London on the proceeds of one robbery. Hamer was discharged, and the remainder of the prisoners were committed for trial.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3200810882.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 1108, "total-output-tokens": 585, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 2404, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
