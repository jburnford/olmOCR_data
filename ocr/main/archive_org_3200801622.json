Mr. Grantham said he appeared for Mr. Dew to ask his lordship to assess the amount of compensation to which he was entitled under the 121st section of the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act, in consequence of the railway companies taking possession of his premises for purposes connected with the railway. When the interest of a tenant was only from year to year the compensation had to be assessed by a magistrate. The case was a simple one, but had been productive of a great deal of litigation. The details of the case having been gone into, the Lord Mayor fixed the total amount of the compensation due to Mr. Dew at \u00a3698 4s. ld. Mr. Grantham then applied for costs, and the Lord Mayor granted twenty guineas costs.\n\nAt the Cardiff Police-court, on Saturday, Thomas Evans was remanded on a charge of having caused the death of John Collins, on May 27th. The parties, it was alleged, quarrelled and fought, and Collins fell and Evans knelt on him and then kicked him until he was taken up insensible. He was taken home, but lingered till Friday, when he died. Prisoner was remanded for a week. He is said to be a very violent man, and has been previously charged with killing a man in a fight.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3200801622.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 1568, "total-output-tokens": 385, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 1578, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
