The accepted division of the Service into Bengal, Bombay and Madras, though still convenient for some purposes, and necessary as long as the Funds exist in their present shape, is antiquated, and generally useless, as a Bombay Civilian may serve in the Panj\u00e1b or Lower Bengal, a Madras Civilian at Simla and a Bengal Civilian in Madras or Bombay (as is now the case). I have therefore as much as possible ignored the distinction of Bengal, Bombay and Madras Services, and have treated all three as one great Indian Civil Service having the same prospects, conditions, origin and constitution.\n\nIt is by this name alone that the Service is known in England, and it has the great advantage of representing the unity and identity of the whole service which the use of the three separate names impliedly denies. Taking the Service all over India as one corporate body I have tried to give with regard to each member of it all the facts which are necessary to show (1) if he be still a member\u2014his position and standing in the service, his locality, pay, and past services or (2) if he have died or retired\u2014the date and place of the death and the date of the retirement.\n\nFor this purpose I have compiled the following lists:\n\n(1) a Combined List.\n(2) a Provincial List.\n(3) an Appointment List.\n(4) a Distribution List.\n(5) a Salary List.\n(6) an Establishment List.\n(7) a Service List.\n\nall but the 1st and 5th of these are arranged according to the nine Provinces into which India is divided.\n\n(1) The Combined List shows in one list arranged according to the order of passing the Final Examinations (whether at Haileybury or with the Civil Service Commissioners) all the Civilians now in the Service. In the first portion containing those Civilians who were appointed from Haileybury I have (from want of further information) only been able to give the Civilians in the order in which they stand in each year in each Presidency with their number in that year, their province, pay and appointments (with dates).\n\nIn the second portion containing those Civilians who have been appointed under the Competition system I have arranged the names in the exact order in which they stood at the Final Examinations in England and have included all those who have\neither died or retired, their names being given in Italics. This arrangement was not a matter so easy as would at first sight seem probable; for, as is always the case in dealing with any large number of persons, the most unexpected freaks and irregularities appear occasionally.\n\nThus the O. S. Commissioners for three or four years (1868-70) arranged the selected candidates not (as they were bound to do, in my opinion, by their own regulations, if not by law) according to the results of the Final Examination only, but according to the total number of marks obtained in all the Examinations after the open Competition. This list was accepted by the Provincial Governments and the Civilians now rank for seniority in accordance with it; but I am unable to find in the regulations any authority for such an arrangement, and I have accordingly in the Combined list ranked these Civilians according \"to their position at the Final Examination\" as prescribed in the published regulations.\n\nThen again several Civilians have passed in the Open Competition and failed in the Final Examination, have then begun all over again and succeeded in passing both examinations, coming out to India four years after their names first appear in the Examination lists. Others have been prevented by ill-health and other causes from passing the Final Examination in the year when their contemporaries did so, and have finally passed a year later; or have only been admitted to the list of successful candidates much later than others owing to the death or resignation of some of those above them. In this case also they have generally been allowed to come out to India a year later than those who passed the open Competition with them.\n\nThese variations make the Combined list no easy one to compile; but I believe that as it has been done three or four times over, and has been carefully checked subsequently, it is nearly as accurate as it is possible to make it. I have excluded from this list all those who, though they passed the Final Examinations, did not proceed to India, as they can hardly be said to have belonged to the Indian Civil Service since they never joined it. The only exception that I have discovered is Mr. A. W. Hume, (No. 290) of 1863 whose name was included by mistake and the error discovered too late for correction. He did not come out to India in the Service; but, as far as I am aware or can ascertain, all the other Civilians whose names are included in this list actually landed in India and joined their appointments.\n\nThe Combined List therefore shows the exact relative position held by each Civilian to all others; and gives the names of all Civilians of all Provinces and Presidencies in one general list. The Combined List gives in the case of each Competition Civilian (1) his number in the Combined list (2) his number in the Final Examination of his year (3) his number in the open Competitive Examination of his year; (if the Civilian did not pass the open Competition along with the others who came out to India in his year, this column is left blank,) (4) his name in full (in the case of Oriental members, I have corrected the spelling of the names (when necessary) according to the Jonesian system) (5) his Degree or Degrees: (6) his University and College or, where he was not at any College, his School. When this column is blank,\nit shows that the member was privately educated or only at private schools; all schools which are not purely private schools are entered. The Colleges and Schools are taken from the C. S. Commissioners' reports up to 1863 inclusive, and after that from the lists sent out to the Government of India by the C. S. Commissioners, so that they may be relied on as accurate; (7) his Province i.e. the Province to which he is actually attached at the present time; where Bombay and Madras Civilians are serving under the Government of India, I have entered Bo. C. S. and M. C. S. under the word \"India.\" (8) his salary i.e. his total pay including acting allowances (9) his appointments i.e. both substantive and officiating, but the necessity of saving space has generally compelled me to give the date of only the most recent appointment.\n\n(2.) The Provincial Lists.\u2014In these lists I have taken the local Gradation Civil Service List of the Province and have excluded from it all those who no longer hold a substantive appointment in that province, so that the list may show the exact order of Civilians for promotion by seniority in the province. In other respects the provincial lists are exactly re-printed except that I have reduced the length of the entries under the column of \"Remarks\" wherever I found it possible to do so.\n\nThe list No. 1 of those Civilians serving under the Government of India is entirely original as it has never been published, I believe that all the other entries may be depended on as complete; but I found it impossible in some instances to trace what leave had been taken during service. It is corrected up to about the 15th March. Most of the other provincial lists had to be printed early in February and in the more distant provinces they do not profess to be corrected up to a later date than the 1st January but that of Madras is corrected up to March 1st and a good many corrections have been made in the N.W.P. list also up to about March 1st. In future years I hope to reprint the Provincial lists directly I receive them, and have the whole work out by the end of January.\n\n(3) The Appointment Lists.\u2014These lists contain the names of all the Civilians who are comprised in the Provincial lists re-arranged according to the nature of the appointments they hold.\n\nThey represent the Civilian portion of parts III to XVI of the ordinary Civil lists.\n\nIn these again the first part relating to the Government of India is original and will I hope be found useful as it was not available before. In the 2nd, or Lower Bengal, portion I have had to condense considerably as it was much more detailed than those of other Provinces.\n\nIt may be necessary to notice that in the Non-Regulation Provinces like the Punjab, the Appointment list differs from the Provincial list in giving the Civilians classified under each kind of appointment instead of by strict seniority. The latter principle prevails so generally that at first sight each list might seem to be a reprint of the other, but it is not so. In the Provincial lists some of the Non-Regulation Governments arrange Civilians according to a system of provincial seniority, the principle of which is not stated; but I presume that the rank is determined by the date of passing the Provincial Higher Standard of Examination. I am not aware on what\nauthority the seniority of Civilians among themselves is decided by these examinations, as in all Regulation Provinces the rank in the Provincial list is determined by the order of passing the Final Examination in England; and under the Act of Parliament constituting the Competition Service, this latter examination is the only one which is recognized as determining rank in the Service, (Section 32, 21 and 22 Vict. Cap. 106).\n\n(4) The Distribution Lists.\u2014These lists show under each Province the Divisions and Districts into which it is divided with the Civilians who are posted at each station. In the 1st part, the Government of India, the distribution is of course according to Departments as there are no local sub-divisions; but I have shown in this section, under the head of each place, what officers of the Government of India are actually serving there now. In Regulation Provinces I have given the Judge, Magistrate, Joint Magistrate and Assistant Magistrate of each district and in the Non-Regulation Provinces the Deputy Commissioner, Judicial Assistant, Assistant Commissioner and Settlement Officers (if any). The Commissioners of Divisions are given in both cases in the first column on the left hand. A list of the Officers at Head Quarters is given before each Provincial Distribution list and officers who do not belong to any particular district are included in this list.\n\nIn Bombay the Sub-Divisions are more numerous and I have given the Judge, Assistant Judge, Collector, 1st Assistant Collector, 2nd Assistant Collector, and Assistant Collector of each district. In Madras I have added to the divisions usual in Northern India those of Head Assistant Collector (answering to 2nd grade Joint Magistrate) and Special Assistant, the latter being confined to five districts. There are Commissioners of Divisions in Bombay but none in Madras; while there is a Board of Revenue in Madras but none in Bombay; in Bengal and the N. W. P. there are of course both classes of officers: the Members of the Board are shown in the list of officers at Head Quarters.\n\nThe whole of these Distribution lists are compiled in an original form, which I think has the advantage of clearness and compactness, although the information was previously available in various forms in the different Civil lists.\n\n(5.) The Salary List\u2014In this List I have thrown together the names of all the Civilians throughout India who draw a salary of Rs. 2,000 a month or more: and have shown with regard to each, (1) his number on the list, (2) his name, (3) his pay including officiating allowances, (4) his province to which he is at present attached, (5) his year of entry into the Service and (6) his present appointment.\n\nI have fixed the limit at 2,000 Rs. because this includes all the higher officials such as Judges and Magistrates (except 2nd and 3rd grade) and it was useless rearranging according to salaries the great majority of the Service which receives well known salaries as Joint Magistrates, Assistant Magistrates, &c.\n\n(6.) The Establishment Lists.\u2014These lists are intended to show the strength of the Establishment of Civilians serving under each Government in India. Each list gives the number of officers of each designation serving under that parti-\ncular Government with the amount of their salaries: it does not represent the sanctioned strength of establishment; but gives the number of officers actually serving under each Government on the 1st of January 1880.\n\nThese numbers are, it will be seen\u2014\n\nI. Government of India ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 63\nII. Lower Bengal ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 214\nIII. N. W. P. ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 194\nIV.

British Barmah ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 27\nVIII. Madras ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 160\nIX. Bombay ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 148\n\nTotal 943\n\nThe total number of Civilians serving in India is given at the end of the Combined list, (p. 96) and also in Appendices IX & X as 917; the difference is due to some of the Civilians serving under the Government of India having been reckoned again in the lists of their own Presidency: the error was discovered too late to be rectified in this issue: there are really only 34 Civilians possessing substantive appointments under the Government of India.\n\nThe Establishment Lists are original and have not been published before.\n\n(7.) The Table of Average Salaries of all Civilians of each year in each Province on the 1st January 1880. This table is an enlargement and continuation up to date of the table of Average salaries which I gave in my book on \"The Indian Civil Service and the Competition system\" in 1875.\n\nThe figures under each Year and Province represent the average salary of all the Civilians of that year who are actually serving in that province at the time: the last column gives the average of those averages, and shows the average pay of all the Civilians of each year throughout India.\n\nThe table shows some curious results: for instance in the column of Average of all India, it will be seen that the pay is highest in 1846, viz., Rs. 4,833, and is higher in 1846 and 1847 than in 1844 and 1845, in 1848 it sinks suddenly to only 2,729 Rs. and then rises in 1849 to 3,708 Rs. and in 1850 to Rs. 3,852, both of which are higher than those of 1844; these high rates in 1849-50 are caused by the salaries of Members of Council. Again in 1852, it is 3,956 Rs. or a higher rate than any of the previous years except 1846-7. It then keeps at about 3,000 Rs. from 1853 to 1856: in 1857 it drops to 2,700 Rs. and remains at that rate during 1858 and 1859.\n\nFrom 1860 it decreases rapidly and steadily from 2,251 Rs. in that year to 1,709 Rs. in 1863, but in 1864 it rises again to 1,799 Rs. owing to an appointment of Rs. 2,583 in the Central Provinces: it falls suddenly in 1865 to 1,162 Rs. and then rises again in\n1867 to Rs. 1,392 owing to two appointments on Rs. 2,000 in that year in the North Western Provinces and Bombay. In 1868 it falls to Rs. 1,013 and in 1869 to Rs. 927 whence it rises in 1870 to Rs. 969 owing to one appointment of 2,000 Rs. having fallen to that year in British Barmah. From 1871 it decreases steadily from 878 Rs. in that year to Rs. 404 in 1879. It may be interesting, to know that the average pay of all Civilians in all India, from 1844 to 1879 is Rs. 2,140 per mensem. If we compare the salaries in different Provinces in the same year, we find great variations. Thus beginning from 1850 at which time the numbers of Civilians still remaining in the list first commence to be sufficiently large to give a fair average per province, it will be seen that while India is Rs. 6,666 and Madras nearly Rs. 4,000, the N. W. P. and Bombay are only Rs. 3,000 and Bengal is only 2,500 Rs. On the other hand in 1856 India is only 2,791, while the Panjab is 3,222 and Bengal and Bombay about 2,900, Madras being 2,500 and the N. W. P. only 2,200. Later on, in the years when such large numbers of Civilians were sent to Northern India, the figures are as follows: In 1861 India is 2,500, Madras 2,333, Bengal 2,069 and Bombay 2,000 while the N. W. P. and Panjab are only 1,892 and 1,785 respectively. In 1862 India is again 2,500 while Bombay and Madras run it close with 2,436 and 2,335; but Bengal, N. W. P. and Panjab decrease in that order, being 1,880, 1,526 and 1,477. The five provinces which are really similarly constituted (the Government of India and the smaller provinces being exceptional) are Bengal, N. W. P., Panjab, Bombay and Madras, and these, in the years regarding which there has been so much controversy, seem to be situated as follows: from 1861 to 1863 (all years given are to be considered inclusive) Madras is much the best off with 2,333, 2,385, and 1,834, Bombay comes next with 2,009, 2,436 and 1,724, Lower Bengal third with 2,069, 1,880 and 1,635, the N. W. P. fourth with 1,892, 1,526 and 1,280, and the Panjab last with 1,785, 1,477 and 1,595.\n\nBut in 1864 a great change occurs and the Panjab jumps up to first place with 2,000, Bombay being second with 1,728 and Bengal third with 1,672, Madras is fourth with 1,169 and N. W. P. last with 900. The 2,000 in the Panjab is so very high that I am rather afraid there may have been some mistake in the calculations; but I have no books at present with me so I cannot verify them. In 1865 the order is Bombay 1st, Bengal 2nd, Panjab 3rd, N. W. P. 4th and Madras 5th, so that it may be given as a general conclusion that from 1861 to 1863 Madras is the best off, and the Panjab and N. W. P. are the worst off; and in 1864 and 1865 the Panjab and Bombay are the best off and Madras and the N. W. P. are the worst off. Up to 1864 Bombay is always second and Lower Bengal third among these Provinces, but in 1865 Bombay is first and Lower Bengal second.\n\nFrom 1867 to 1870 Madras is worse off than the N. W. P. or Bengal; but from 1870 onwards Madras is better off than the N. W. P.\n\n(8) The Rate of Pay Table shows the number and the percentage of Civilians in each Province who are drawing each rate of pay at intervals of 500 Rs.; from those who draw 500 Rs. or under, to those who draw more than 3,500 Rs., of whom there are only 54 in all India.\nThe total number of each grade in all India is:\n\n| Grade          | No. | Percentage |\n|----------------|-----|------------|\n| Not above 500  | 137 | 14\u00b74       |\n| 500 to 1,000   | 289 | 30\u00b74       |\n| 1,000 to 1,500 | 121 | 12\u00b78       |\n| 1,500 to 2,000 | 104 | 11\u00b70       |\n| 2,000 to 2,500 | 167 | 17\u00b76       |\n| 2,500 to 3,000 | 45  | 4\u00b77        |\n| 3,000 to 3,500 | 32  | 3\u00b74        |\n| above 3,500    | 54  | 5\u00b77        |\n\nTotal 949 100\u00b70\n\nIt will be seen therefore that 30 per cent. or nearly one-third of all Civilian salaries are between 500 and 1,000; that 24 per cent. or nearly one-fourth are between 1,000 and 2,000; and 22 per cent. or nearly one-fourth are between 2,000 and 3,000; the remaining one-sixth consists of 14 per cent. below 500 and of 10 per cent. above 3,000; so that, taking the totals, 10 per cent. are above 3,000; 32 per cent. are above 2,000; 55 per cent. are above 1,000; and 86 per cent. are above 500.\n\n(9) (10) and (11).\u2014The Lists of the Members of the Bengal, Madras and Bombay Services who have retired or died since 1857.\n\nThese lists contain the name of every member of the Service who has retired or died since 1857, so far as I have been able to ascertain them. I have compiled them from the original Service Gradation lists, and I have every reason to believe them complete and accurate; but, in some few instances, I have been unable to ascertain the date of death or retirement.\n\nI have commenced the list from 1857, as that year is a landmark in the history of the services, both from the occurrence of the Mutiny, and from the fact that it was the first year in which the Members appointed by Competition took up their duties as Civilians, although a few had landed in India at the end of 1856. In Bengal in 1857, I have distinguished those who were killed in the Mutiny by an asterisk, and it will be seen that thirty names are so marked. I hope in a future issue to give the dates of entry into the Service of all those who have retired or died; but I was unable to ascertain them in time for this issue.\n\nThe very large number who retired in Bengal in 1877, the year when the graded pensions were granted, will be noticed; they amount to 36 as against from 10 to 15 in an ordinary year.\n\nThese death and retirement lists are original and have been somewhat difficult and laborious to compile; but I hope they will be found useful, as the information, even with regard to any one man, was only to be found before by hunting up old Civil Lists, and the search often ended in disappointment, as the lists of casualties were very imperfectly compiled.\nIn Part XII. I have given an abstract of these lists which shows the number of Civilians who retired and died in each year in each Presidency, and the total for all India.\n\nIt will be seen that the total varies from 69 in 1857 and 58 in 1877 to 19 in 1870, but the former were abnormal years on account of the Mutiny and of the special retirements. The highest of the normal years is 50 in 1863, so that the number of deaths and retirements in the whole Indian Civil Service in a normal year may be said to vary between 20 and 50. The average of the 21 normal years from 1858 to 1879 inclusive (but excluding 1877) is 34\u00b74; and the rate of recruitment, when taken over long periods, and as long as the Service remains at its present strength, should no doubt be about 35 per annum. The actual rate of recruitment since 1865 (inclusive) has been 33\u00b78, and, as the losses have been 34\u00b74, they have almost exactly balanced one another. It will be seen that the total number of Civilians stood at 909 in 1865 and is now 917: the slight difference is due to the average losses having been calculated from 1858, while the average recruitment has been taken from 1865, the years between 1858 and 1865 having been periods of abnormally large recruitment.\n\nThe proportion of Deaths to Retirements in any Presidency is of course very various: thus in Bengal in 1860 there were 22 retirements to 6 deaths, while in 1862 there were only 3 retirements to 7 deaths. In 1871 there were 16 retirements to 2 deaths, while in 1876 there were only 6 retirements to 12 deaths; this last variation was however probably caused by Civilians postponing their retirement in 1876 on account of the proposed scheme for the acceleration of promotion which many thought would include a bonus to retiring members.\n\nPart XIII contains a complete History of the Services of all Civilians, as far as I have been able to obtain them.\n\nDivision I.\u2014The Government of India is entirely original as the Services of these officers have not been published before; the earlier portions of their services have been taken from the Provincial Service Lists of the Provinces to which they belonged previous to their transfer to the Government of India; and the latter portion has been compiled by myself from the various Gradation lists. The record is by no means complete; but it is the best that is available until the Services are published officially. I have had to omit entirely many officers who are serving under the Government of India merely because I could find no record of their Services.\n\nDivisions II (Bengal), III (N.W.P.), and IV (Punjab) are taken from the published Provincial Lists of Services; but are very much abbreviated and reduced in bulk by the omission of all unimportant matter and by the use of abbreviations for all well known words. Even with this precaution the total Services occupy 157 pages of the work, and if the reduction in bulk had not been made they would have occupied at least 250 pages. The Madras List of Services has been reprinted as it was, because it was standing ready in type; but next year (if this work is re-published) it will be reduced like the others.\n\nI trust that the omissions and abbreviations will not be found objectionable in any way. I have omitted (1) all privilege leave, as it does not affect service, (2) all subsidiary leave, (3) all short periods of absence without leave up to 10 days, and (4) all promotions to and reversions from Joint Magistracies or different grades of Joint\nMagistracies, when not exceeding three months. These are I think quite unimportant, and their omission has enabled me to reduce the bulk of some records very considerably.\n\nThe British Barmah List of Services reached me just as this part of the book was going to Press and is re-printed with the usual abbreviations.\n\nThe only two Provinces in which I have been unable to obtain any list of Services are Assam and the Central Provinces. I have consequently been able to give a record of Services only of those Civilians who were previously in the N. W. P. and whose records were available from that Provincial list. I hope to be able to obtain Service lists of these Provinces before next year, if they are being compiled.\n\nAppendices.\u2014I now come to the Appendices about which much need not be said as the headings explain themselves. Appendix I, the diagram of the supply of Civilians, illustrates, I think, forcibly the irregularity of that supply during the earlier years of the Competition system: since 1865 it has been much more regular, and the inconveniences produced by the earlier want of system will no doubt not be felt in future. Appendices II and III are continuations up to date of the similar tables which I published in my work on the Indian Civil Service in 1875. They give all the figures and details with regard to recruitment and to losses by death and retirement, and will I hope prove useful.\n\nAppendix IV gives the College or School of each Civilian and this is the first time I have been able to give a table of this kind complete up to date, as the C. S. Commissioners ceased to publish these data from 1864. I have however now obtained them from the lists sent out by the Secretary of State to the Indian Governments, and I think it will be admitted that no greater refutation is possible of Col. G. Chesney\u2019s ill-founded and inaccurate statement, that the University and Public School men among the Competition Civilians are \u201cmere waifs and strays.\u201d Colonel Chesney said (Edinburgh Review, April 1874) \u201cpractically the English Universities contribute no candidates to the Competition\u201d; how many \u201ccandidates\u201d they contribute I do not know, nor does Colonel Chesney, as the Colleges of the unsuccessful competitors are not given anywhere; but this table will prove how many of the successful competitors are University men, even in the narrow sense of the term as used by Colonel Chesney of the English Universities only.\n\nIt will be seen from this table that of 903 men appointed to the Service from 1856 to 1879, 157 were at Oxford and 107 at Cambridge so that in the narrowest sense of the term 264 or nearly one-third were University men, if to these be added the other English, Scotch and Irish Universities we obtain a total of 618 out of 903, who\n\n| Location          | Number |\n|-------------------|--------|\n| Oxford            | 157    |\n| Cambridge         | 107    |\n| Dublin            | 111    |\n| London            | 102    |\n| Queen's, Ireland  | 49     |\n| Edinburgh         | 50     |\n| Aberdeen          | 27     |\n| Glasgow           | 7      |\n| St. Andrews       | 8      |\n\nare bon\u00e2 fide University men. If a proportion of more than two-thirds can fairly be called \u201cmere waifs and strays in the list,\u201d then Colonel Chesney is right; but if not, it would have been perhaps better had he ascertained the facts accurately and carefully before making so reckless and misleading an assertion, as he did when he stated that \u201cscarcely any one ever comes up from the different Universities and Colleges of the\nkingdom for these great prizes\u201d (p. 342, Edin. Rev., April 1874). If we analyse the whole table we find that the proportion of candidates educated at the various classes of institutions is as follows:\n\n| Institution                  | Number |\n|------------------------------|--------|\n| English Universities         | 366    |\n| Scotch                       | 92     |\n| Irish                        | 160    |\n| Foreign                      | 14     |\n| Total Universities           | 632    |\n| Public Schools               | 140    |\n| Private Colleges             | 14     |\n| Grammar Schools              | 68     |\n| Total at Colleges and Public Schools | 854 |\n| At private Schools           | 49     |\n| Grand Total                  | 903    |\n\nPercentage of those educated at Colleges and Private Schools to total number appointed ... 94.6\n\nIt will I think hardly be believed, after all that has been said to the contrary that 95 per cent. of all the Competition Civilians who have come to India have been educated at a University, College, or Public School; but of the fact there can be no doubt. The figures are taken from the official returns compiled by the C. S. Commissioners, and the only point on which there can be any difference of opinion is as to which schools are to be reckoned public schools and which are not; but I think my list will be accepted as a fair one, and I have included all Grammar Schools, as they are really public schools as opposed to proprietary schools. It may therefore be said with confidence that 95 per cent. of the Competition Civilians have been educated at a University, College, Public School or Grammar School, and only 5 per cent. at private schools and by private tuition. If this be the case, surely all the ill-founded statements, about the Service being supplied chiefly from the cramming institutions, and about the \u201cUniversity and Public School system being wrong, if the system of selection for the Indian Civil Service is right\u201d* may be consigned to the oblivion they deserve; for the two systems, thus absurdly contrasted, are now shown to be almost absolutely identical.\n\nAppendix V gives all the details with regard to the University Degrees obtained by Civilians in each year, and Appendix VI gives an abstract of the figures so arrived at. I think that the percentage of Graduates shown will create some surprise and yet, as I have remarked in the foot-note to this Appendix, it is by no means complete, for it is impossible in many cases to ascertain the degrees. It will be seen that from 1856 to\n\n* Col. Chesney, Edin. Rev., April 1874.\n1860 the number of graduates never fell below 50 per cent., that out of the 22 years, it was over 40 per cent. in 9 years and over 30 per cent. in 15 years, while the average for the whole 22 years is 37 per cent. The figure of 36 per cent. given at the bottom column is inclusive of the year 1879, about which my information is very imperfect as yet, but from 1856 to 1878 the average of graduates is 37 per cent. or somewhat more than a third of all the Civilians. The only years in which the percentage sank below 20 are 1869 and 1877. If those who possess degrees and are not mentioned in the Appendix V will kindly inform me of the fact, I am sure that the results will be even more favourable than they are now.\n\nThe total number of Graduates of each kind is as follows:\n\n| Degree       | Number |\n|--------------|--------|\n| B. A.        | 191    |\n| M. A.        | 99     |\n| LL. B.       | 13     |\n| LL. D.       | 10     |\n| D. C. L.     | 4      |\n| Other Degrees| 8      |\n\nTotal... 325\n\nAppendix VII gives all the honorary distinctions which have been awarded to members of the Service, and I have added the names of those who are Fellows of Learned Societies, as far as I have been able to ascertain them; but I have no doubt that there are many more. It will be seen that the numbers possessing orders are\u2014\n\nI. The Bath\u2014\n   1. G. C. B. ... ... ... ... 1\n   2. K. C. B. ... ... ... ... 4\n   3. C.

It will be noted in the open Competitions that in 1859 Mathematics was raised from 1,000 to 1,250, and Sanskrit and Arabic from 375 to 500; in 1867 the number of marks (1,000) awarded to English literature was divided into 500 for literature and 500 for History, and the marks for Sanskrit were reduced from 500 to 375. In 1869 Sanskrit was put back to 500, and Natural Science was increased from 500 to 1,000.\n\nIn July 1878 the first examination under the new system of enforced attendance at a University, great changes were made. English Composition, History and Literature were reduced from 500 to 300 each, Greek was reduced from 750 to 600 and Latin increased from 750 to 800. French and German were augmented from 375 to 500, while Italian was raised from 375 to 400, Mathematics was lowered from 1,250 to 1,000, and Natural Science from 1,000 to 600, being also divided into Electricity, &c., 300 and Mechanics, &c., 300; Moral Science was reduced from 500 to 300 and was confined to Logic. There has not been time as yet to see what the effects of these changes will be. I append the names of the first men in each subject in the whole 24 years, with their marks and the Maximum, but the fixed deduction of 125 must of course be taken into account after 1863.\n\n| Subject                  | Year | Name            | Marks | Maximum |\n|--------------------------|------|-----------------|-------|---------|\n| English Composition      | 1861 | M.

Law was raised from 1,000 to 1,200; the History and Geography of India and Political Economy were reduced from 500 to 350; and all the vernacular languages of India and Arabic were increased from 350 to 400. Since 1865 no changes have been made.\nThe names of the first men in each subject are as follows:\n\n| Subject                  | Year | Name          | Marks | Maximum |\n|--------------------------|------|---------------|-------|---------|\n| Law                      | 1871 | E.

It will be seen that Bengal has exactly twice as many as Madras and Bombay put together, 611 against 306, and I think this great disproportion shows the anachronism of keeping up the three services separate. The Bengal service now really furnishes officers for all India except the Regulation districts of the Madras and Bombay Presidencies. As regards the Provinces, Lower Bengal has the largest staff 214, and the N.W.P. the next 194, both these, which are mere sub-divisions of the Bengal service, being larger than the whole Presidencies of Madras (160) and Bombay (146). The Non-Regulation Provinces and the Government of India have from 92 down to 23.\n\nAppendix X gives the number of Civilians of each year of entry who are still left in the Service. Of 1840 there is only 1 and of 1843 and 1844 only 2 each. The numbers then mount steadily except that there are only 3 left of 1848, till we come to 1852 which has only 7. After this the number is regulated chiefly by the original supply in that year.\n\nThe large years are 1856\u201431  \n1857\u201445  \n1861\u201453  \n1862\u201450  \n1863\u201469  \n1864\u201444\n\nAfter 1864 there are never more than 40 in any year; but in the three years 1861, 1862\u20143 there are in Bengal still 122 members of the Service, or one-fifth of the whole (611). Madras has 57 Civilians in 1862\u20143\u20144 alone out of a total of 160; and Bombay has 48 in 1867\u20148\u20149\u201470, out of a total of 146. The blocks in the respective\nservices occur therefore in the latter of these years in 1862\u20143 in Bengal; in 1863\u20144 in Madras and in 1869\u201470 in Bombay; and it might be well if the overflowing years of one Presidency could feed the scanty years of another, so as to equalize promotion to some extent throughout India.\n\nAppendices XI and XII show the respective numbers of Haileybury and Competition Civilians in the three Presidencies and 9 Provinces, at each period of 5 years from 1860 to 1880, and also in 1858, the earliest year for which I could obtain data. Dealing only with totals for all India, it will be seen that there were in 1858, 798 Haileybury Civilians to 52 Competition ones; by 1860 there was but little change, the numbers being 750 to 67.\n\nBut by 1865 a great change had occurred, and they were then 547 to 362 or $1\\frac{1}{2}$ to 1: by 1870 the Competition Civilians had exceeded the Haileybury in number, and were 498 to 418. By 1875 the proportions were 661 to 295, or more than two to one; and by 1880 this had increased to 750 to 167 or $4\\frac{1}{2}$ to 1.\n\nIn Appendix XIII I have distinguished the Haileybury and Competition Civilians from one another in the only years when they are mixed up together, viz., 1856 and 1857 in Bengal and Bombay. In Madras the Haileybury Civilians end in 1857 and the Competition do not begin till 1860.\n\nIn Appendix XIV, and last, I have shown the number of Civilians who were in the service in each Presidency in each year from 1857 to 1880. It will be seen that the total has varied but little in the 23 years; it was 886 in 1857 and is 917 now. It rose to its highest point 968 in 1873 and fell to its lowest 802 in 1861.\n\nIn Bengal it has increased from 553 in 1857 to 611 in 1880 owing to the absorption into that Presidency of the Non-Regulation Provinces; but Madras has decreased from 185 to 160 and Bombay from 148 to 146.\n\nThe largest number in Bengal was 644 in 1877 and the smallest 494 in 1861.\n\nThe largest number in Madras was 196 in 1865 and the smallest 153 in 1862.\n\nThe largest number in Bombay was 175 in 1874 and the smallest 126 in 1863.\n\nI have now explained and illustrated as far as I was able all the parts of the book, and the Appendices, and I need only speak of a few topics of a more general nature.\n\n(1) Spelling.\u2014As regards the spelling of the names of places, I have followed the Jonesian or scientific system absolutely, and have not attempted any compromise, which, though it may be suitable for official works intended for all classes of readers, is very unsatisfactory, unscientific, and ill-adapted for the members of a highly educated service who will be the chief readers of this book. In Northern India, I believe, I have been able to give the names with accuracy; in Bombay I have sometimes been doubtful; in Madras the corruptions from the native names are so astounding, that they assume the form of wholly different words, and it is necessary to give a more or less imperfect transliteration in order that the word may be recognizable as the same. In Barmah I have not ventured to interfere with the spelling, except in the case of a few well-known names; but it is now evidently totally unsystematic.\n\n(2) Corrections\u2014I have corrected up to the latest date practicable and have made many alterations while the book was passing through the Press; the Combined\nlist is corrected up to the 25th March and should be referred to in all cases where the latest information is required.\n\nThe Provincial and Appointment Lists are chiefly reprinted from the Civil Lists of the 1st of January, but corrections have been made wherever it was possible. The lists of Services have not been corrected up to a later date than that at which they have been published by the Local Governments, as I found the task an impossible one.\n\n(3) Objects effected.\u2014I hope that by uniting in one volume of moderate size the whole of the Civil Service portions of the Civil lists of 9 Provinces, and the lists of Services which form five separate volumes, besides giving much new and original matter, I shall have provided the members of the Service with a work which will be useful, (1) from its saving expense and bulk, as the same information could only be obtained before from 9 separate volumes, (2) from its concentrating in one volume all the Civilian portion of many volumes, the remainder of which was not required as a rule by Civilian readers, and (3) by its affording much information which was previously either not available at all, or was only attainable after long and troublesome searches.\n\n(4) Delay in publishing.\u2014I promised this work for the end of March, but I think I shall be excused for the delay of three weeks which has occurred, when it is remembered that this is a first attempt, and that it has been made under the constant pressure of very heavy official work. In future years, I hope to have the volume published by the end of January or early in February.\n\n(5) Omissions.\u2014I have been compelled by the great size the book was attaining to omit several of the portions which I promised in the Prospectus to include. These are chiefly,\n\n(1) the Civilian portions of the Financial Codes.\n(2) the Lists of the Services in former years.\nand (3) the Regulations for Examinations, &c.\n\nThe printers had originally estimated that the portions of the book now published would occupy about 500 pages and I then hoped to have room for the above articles but when it was found that we had already got to 700 pages without any of them I was obliged to give up all hope of including them as the book would have swelled to 1,000 pages and would have been of unwieldy size.\n\nAs it is, it will be over 700 pages instead of 500, and I hope that on this account it will not be thought unreasonable that the price has been raised from five rupees to six. I hope to issue before long a small volume containing, (1) the Civilian portion of the Financial Codes, corrected up to date, (2) the Regulations for all Examinations connected with the Service, and (3) the latest editions of the rules of the three Civil Funds. This will, I think, constitute a useful Civilians' Manual and will form a supplement to the present work. I hope that it may be ready in three or four months time; and I shall then have before me only one portion of the task which I hope some day to accomplish, viz.,\u2014a sketch of the History of the Indian Civil Service from its first origin.\n(6). Subscriptions. In the nine weeks which have elapsed since the issue of my Prospectus of this work, I have received 315 promises of subscription, including the different Governments, to the issue of this year; and I think I may fairly hope that 200 more Civilians will take the book; but comparatively very few of those who have subscribed this year have promised to take the work regularly, so that I am still quite in uncertainty as to whether I shall be able to continue the publication annually. I think that considering the very great number of alterations which occur in a large Service like the Indian Civil Service, a year would be the longest interval at which the work could be published with any advantage: if it were published more seldom than this, it might have an historical interest, but could hardly be of much use as a current work for reference.\n\nIn conclusion I would beg the utmost indulgence for this first attempt at compiling a work which I would fain hope will be useful but which contains many thousands of entries and dates, every one of which is liable to error in all the four stages of its career, in the hands of the compiler, of the copyist, of the compositor, and of the reader of proofs. I have read all the proofs myself, except portions of the Provincial and of the Service lists, and every portion of the Book has been carefully read three times in proof, in revise and in final revise by an M. A. of the Madras University, whom I have employed to assist me in this compilation: but I know too well that in a work of this kind I cannot hope to have escaped a multitude of errors and I can only ask the indulgence of my readers for a first attempt, made amid the distractions of heavy official work, and interrupted occasionally by illness, and promise them that, if the support accorded to the work is sufficient to justify me in re-publishing it annually, I will do my best that each year shall see an improvement in the book and a step in advance towards that perfect accuracy which is so hopelessly unattainable in a work of this kind.\n\nA.
