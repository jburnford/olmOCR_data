MONTAGU, the wife of Robert Acheson Montagu, of Cramore House, Coleraine, has been committed for trial at Londonderry Assizes on the charge of causing the death of her daughter, Mary Ellen, aged three years. At the inquest on the body of the child it was stated that on the 13th the child's governess, Rose Dossell, locked the deceased in a dark room as a punishment for some childish offence. Mrs. Montagu, it was alleged, came in some time later and tied the child's arms behind her back with a stocking, to which she tied a string, and then fastened the cord to a ring in the wall. About three hours afterwards she went to the door of the room and called the child by name, but, hearing no response, she went in and found her leaning forward. She unfastened her and carried her to her bed-room, and endeavoured to restore animation, but life was then extinct. The medical evidence was that death was caused by strangulation. Mr. Montagu reported the facts to the constabulary, and several constables were sent to the house and remained there until the inquest. Mrs. Montagu was allowed bail, herself in \u00a3400 and two sureties of \u00a310 each.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3200810134.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 2166, "total-output-tokens": 319, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 1179, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
