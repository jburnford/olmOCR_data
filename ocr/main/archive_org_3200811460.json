They had been married only four months. The man appeared to have been subjected to considerable provocation from the deceased, with whom he formerly lodged. Her former husband had been dead about twelve months, and her grown-up daughters opposed the marriage.\n\nTHE SHOCKING CHARGE AGAINST AN INSPECTOR.\u2014Lionel Hans Hamilton, forty-five, lately Government Inspector of Factories for the North-Eastern District, and Henry Dady, twenty-two, clerk, were charged, at Newcastle, on Wednesday, jointly and separately, with indecency, and with having conspired to induce others to commit shocking offences. After some evidence had been taken the further hearing of the case was adjourned for a week. Hamilton held a good position in society, and the scandal has caused considerable sensation.\n\nARSON AT TOTTENHAM.\u2014On Thursday morning, at twenty minutes to six, a small coal shop in Stamford-road Tottenham, kept by Mr. Ayres, was found to be well alight. The fire was ultimately extinguished, and the damage was confined to the building. There have been four other unsuccessful attempts to burn the place, principally directed against the rear of the building, and in consequence the outbuildings have been pulled down. A fortnight ago Mr. Ayres received an anonymous letter threatening that since the writers could not burn him out at the back they would \"blow his brains out at the front.\"", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3200811460.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 1890, "total-output-tokens": 370, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 1576, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
