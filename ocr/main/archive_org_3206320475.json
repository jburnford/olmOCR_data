He mingles His sympathies with their joys before He mourns with them in their sorrows. He thus tells them that He has not come to look on the dark side of their condition alone, but to take a just view of it; to rejoice with them that rejoice, as well as to weep with them that weep, recognizing the truth that there is much in this world to make us happy, and nothing more so than the love of kindred hearts, united in those bonds which the benevolent Creator constituted in Paradise. \"He has come to deliver us from hell, and He wishes us to know that there is a heaven. We are subject to miseries innumerable and great, our danger is fearful, our liability to eternal sorrow is alarming; but other things also are true, that God loves us with a benevolent and compassionate love, seeks our perfect happiness, and would restore us to that which our first parents lost by the fall; and not only would He make us happy hereafter: He wishes us to know that the ways of Wisdom, here, are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace; that religion is not only consistent with present happiness, but eminently promotes it; that Christ and religion do not frown upon innocent human joys, but, on the contrary, purify them, hallow them, impart a zest to them, and give with them that richest and sweetest ingredient, a sense of God's approbation and love. So that if any are tempted to look upon religion as an enemy to innocent pleasure, and feel that to be followers of Christ is to take the veil; that to enter the Christian Church is to shake hands at the door with every innocent enjoyment; that putting on the new man is to put on stiffness and austerity; that being converted is being made unfit for social life; and that religion means the surrendering of everything and gaining nothing; they may see their error corrected by this testimony of Christ our Saviour, in favour of human happiness, in His being present at a wedding, and in His beginning the work for which He came down from heaven by contributing to the hilarity of a wedding feast. So far from being unfriendly to human happiness, religion alone warrants and enables us to be perfectly happy in this world. The Church of Christ is spoken of in the Bible as the only portion of the human race that has claims to perfect happiness, and we say to you that, if you would be truly happy in this world you must be a true Christian, and give up the world, the flesh, and the devil. Those amusements and pleasures are alone innocent on which you can ask God's blessing.\n\nContributions or stamps are much needed to pay the expenses of inserting in a large number of London, Provincial, Scotch, Welsh, and Irish newspapers (which are supposed to have three million readers weekly) and will be thankfully received by the Rev.
