The offence, as alleged, was committed in the Divorce-court; on the occasion of the trial of a suit, in which the wife of Mr. Bewick, of Threepwood-hall, Northumberland, sought a divorce on the ground of her husband's adultery with one Mary Latham, who was in the capacity of housekeeper to Mr. Bewick when his wife was living apart from him. The prisoner, who had been in Mr. Bewick's service as a domestic, was one of the witnesses called in support of the wife's petition, and she positively swore to acts tending to, and in one particular instance a real act, of adultery. On her evidence principally the court granted a divorce, notwithstanding the strong denial of its truth given by Mr. Bewick. The prisoner was now charged with perjuring herself. Mr. Bewick was examined at great length, and he reiterated his denial of committing any act which could possibly be construed as tending to adultery with Miss Latham. \u2014Mr. Serjeant Sleigh subjected to a severe cross-examination, and elicited from the witness, that when he married, and took his wife to Threepwood-hall, he had two bastards under his roof, and whom, along with the then housekeeper, he, at the instance of his wife, turned out at the expiration of a month. He likewise admitted at the Divorce-court he had sworn to a statement that his wife had committed adultery with a person named Jones, and that he had posted bills about the neighbourhood in which he lived, proclaiming her shame, and offering a reward of \u00a3100. to any person giving information regarding the matter. \u2014Mary Latham, the housekeeper, who appeared about forty years of age, was examined, and denied positively that any undue familiarity had ever taken place between her and Mr. Bewick. The prosecutor was detected by one of the jury beckoning to the witness during her examination, and the fact having been stated, he was ordered to leave the court. \u2014Ann Ouston, wife of the gardener at Threepwood-hall, was the only other witness called, and she stated that the prisoner had said to her that she had seen nothing between Miss Latham and Mr. Bewick. \u2014The learned counsel having addressed the jury a verdict of \"Not guilty\" was returned.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3206230569.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 1108, "total-output-tokens": 565, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 2378, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
