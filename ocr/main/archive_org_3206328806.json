H. L. Raphael and Co., of 25, Throgmorton-street; he was also charged with having feloniously received 20,000l. worth of Peruvian bonds, the property of Messrs. Lewis Cohen and Co., of 31, Throgmorton-street.\n\nDetective-serjeant Outram stated: On Tuesday morning I received from Mr. George Lewis 1,000l., and went with a person I had met by appointment to the Gower-street railway station. This was at twenty minutes to one o'clock. We went to a public-house previously, and at one o'clock we met the prisoner. I was introduced to him as Mr. Frost, from Brighton. We had something to drink in the public-house, which I paid for, and Carr called for three cigars. He then said, \"You know our business?\" and I replied, \"Yes.\" He then asked me if I had got the \"flimsies,\" and I showed him the bank-notes. We afterwards left the public-house, and the prisoner observing, \"I do business with one person,\" he spoke to the third man, and I and the prisoner then drove to the Great Northern hotel, King's-cross. He took me to a room, No. 78, on the fourth floor, and bolting the door he produced a black bag, from which he took the bonds produced, observing, \"There they are.\" I then tied them up and said, \"You must consider yourself in custody; I am a detective from the City, and these bonds are stolen.\" He started, and said, \"What?\" I repeated what I had said, adding, \"You may as well do the thing quietly.\" He replied, \"All right,\" but afterwards he said, and repeated several times, \"You are rather premature in saying the bonds were stolen.\" I said, \"Perhaps so; but you will hear more about it when we get to the City.\" We drove to the City, and the prisoner was charged at Bow-lane. A receipt from the Safe Deposit company was found at the prisoner's house.\n\nMr. Charles Haugh, clerk in the employ of Messrs. Cohen and Co., proved that the nominal value of the bonds produced was 20,000l., and that he made up the parcel which contained them for despatch to Paris on the 1st June.\n\nMr. Wontner, who defended, had no questions to ask the witness, and Mr. Lewis said upon this evidence he should ask for a formal remand until Friday for the prisoner to be charged with Martin. The remand was granted.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3206328806.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 970, "total-output-tokens": 679, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 2562, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
