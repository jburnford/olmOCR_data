They were replied to in the negative, but told they could have 20 trunks done. They then said that it was necessary they should be all done that day, as they were rather queer. When the men left, witness went with Mr. Jarvis, medical officer of health, to Columbia-market, where, placed about the stall occupied by the defendant in his business, he saw 63 trunks or pads of haddock. Behind them stood the defendant and the two men who had been to the smoke curers. The fish were examined, and found to be in a very decomposed state. Defendant said they were his property, but on being asked what he was going to do with them he replied, \"Oh, they are condemned by the inspector.\" He then pointed out one of the inspectors appointed by the Fishmongers' company, who, on coming up, stated that he had condemned them at a quarter to 11. Defendant was told by witness that he, as parish inspector, should seize them as unfit for human food. Defendant refused to let them be removed, and the inspector said that they were in his charge. Shortly afterwards a van was sent for, and by force some were removed by several men, who threatened to punch his (witness's) head if he interfered. A sample of the fish was, however, brought to this court and condemned by the magistrate.\n\nMr. W. Jarvis, M.D., medical officer of health for the parish of Bethnal-green, proved the condition of the fish.\n\nMr. Newton ordered defendant to pay a fine of 10l. and costs (3l. 2s.), and, after remarking on the Fishmongers' company exercising jurisdiction out of the city of London, said that they had better appoint a proper person to act instead of an effete and inefficient servant, who was conniving with the defendant to put money into his pocket by allowing this stinking fish to be smoked and passed off as fit for human food.\n\nDr. Jarvis said it constantly happened that fish was passed by the inspectors at Billingsgate, and when it was brought into the Columbia-market was seized and condemned by the parish officers.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3206235312.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 970, "total-output-tokens": 645, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 2685, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
