Four charges were pressed against the prisoner, although many more cases were reported to the police, and it was shown that the girl carried out the robberies in a most artful and systematic manner. She took apartments and decamped with articles of value, which she immediately pawned. The father of the girl stated that she had been afflicted with kleptomania since early childhood, and that she was not morally responsible for her acts. Dr. Hawkins, resident assistant physician at St. Thomas's hospital, concurred in this view. In this state of the case Mr. Sheil admitted he was much puzzled what to do with the girl. Finally he decided to formally convict her, and take her father's recognisances to bring her up for judgment if called upon.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3206270362.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 1430, "total-output-tokens": 413, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 1734, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
