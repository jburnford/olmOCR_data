He was quietly and respectfully dressed, and during the trial was attentive and watchful, but did not manifest any intense emotion.\n\nThe case for the crown was opened by Mr. Aspinall, who stated that the deceased, James Barton, was an engineer employed at a colliery called Bulkhouse pit, between Chorley and Wigan. He was last seen alive on the night of the 2nd of January, 1863, when he went, as was usual, to take his night turn at minding the fires of the pumping-engine attached to the colliery. He had two sons who took turns with him at this work, and it was the old man's turn that night. At eight o'clock that night the old man was seen in the cabin belonging to the colliery; but at a quarter to three or three o'clock next morning, when one of the men came to work, Barton could not be found. Search was made everywhere, but unsuccessfully. During the search a muffler belonging to Barton was found in the cabin, and it was noticed that it was burnt; but no suspicion was excited by the circumstance at this time. When the furnaces were looked at, to see if they required firing-up, some appearances were discovered, and on further investigation unmistakable signs of portions of a human body having been consumed there were disclosed. Traces of blood, portions of flesh, and bones (which could be identified as human bones) being found there, as well as buttons, and other indestructible portions of a man's dress; and these were portions of the body and dress of the man Barton. A reward was offered for the discovery of the murderers; but a long time elapsed without any result, and it was not until a year or so ago that some circumstances arose which led to the apprehension of certain persons. During the investigations against these persons it became necessary to search a canal in the county, in order to discover a watch which it was known Barton had with him at the time he was murdered. This search caused a great deal of talk in the neighbourhood, and ultimately coming to the knowledge of the prisoner's brother and father, who lived at Chorley, they recollected that the prisoner, who had come home about five o'clock on the morning of the murder, had been dealing with a watch, which, as far as their memory went, corresponded with the watch of the murdered man. The prisoner had been sent to Dartmoor in the meantime, where he was serving a term of penal servitude for another offence, when he was arrested for this crime. The learned counsel said that in all the statements of the prisoner, though he admitted being present at the murder, he very carefully abstained from saying whether he took any personal part in the outrage; but Mr. Aspinall submitted that if the prisoner only accompanied the murderers and shared in the common object of the murder he was equally guilty.\n\nA number of witnesses were then examined, after which Mr. Pope, for the defence, contended that his client ought not to be convicted on the statements made against him.\n\nMr. Baron Martin having summed up, the jury found a verdict of \"Guilty.\" His lordship then sentenced the prisoner to death in the usual manner, holding out no hopes of mercy. The prisoner, who throughout the trial manifested the greatest stolidity, then walked firmly from the dock.\n\nThomas Walton, also indicted for the murder of Barton, was arraigned during the afternoon. Counsel for the prosecution, however, declined to proceed with the case, and the prisoner was discharged. Walton, it will be recollected, also made a confession when intoxicated, but when sober he denied its truth.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3206225744.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 694, "total-output-tokens": 881, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 4001, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
