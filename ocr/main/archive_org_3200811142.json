Mr. Poynter prosecuted. The prosecutor, who is a member of the F Division, stated that on the evening of August 24th he was going from the Marble-arch to the Paddington Police-station, when he met the prisoner in Harrow-road, who told him there were six burglars in Irongate Wharf-road, and that three plain-clothes men were watching them. He went with the prisoner to the back of the Running House public-house, and was there told to watch the third house. Prisoner told him to take his helmet off, as the burglars might see him, and directly afterwards Mallett, who at the time was in the same division of police as the prosecutor, struck him across the temple with either a stick or a truncheon. On attempting to rise he was struck again on the left side, and also on the right arm. His finger was smashed, but he could not exactly say how it was done. The next thing prosecutor remembered was that he was in the public-house. He had never had any disagreement with the prisoner. In cross-examination he denied that he had passed any remark about prisoner not having paid his mess money. Inspector Wyburn stated that when Mallett was charged he said, \"I had no instrument. I struck him with my fist, and he fell against the wall, which must have caused the injury.\" Prisoner and prosecutor were then taken to Scotland-yard, where the Chief-Constable suspended Mallett, pending further inquiries, and in the meantime he absconded. By order of the Commissioner a warrant was issued for his apprehension. Prisoner, in the course of his examination of the several witnesses, tried to show there was a very strong feeling among the men at his station against him, and that the statement of the prosecutor could not be relied on. He was convicted and sentenced to twelve months' hard labour.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3200811142.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 1476, "total-output-tokens": 469, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 1974, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
