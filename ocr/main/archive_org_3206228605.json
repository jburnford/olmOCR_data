Fordell and Strathburn are two farms in the vicinity of the village of Leuchars. It appears that on Friday afternoon the deceased, along with Williamson and a number of farm servants, had been at a sale of stock on the farm at Strathburn. In the afternoon a quarrel arose between Williamson and deceased regarding a dog which the former had. Glenning had, it is stated, threatened to strike or kick the dog, upon which Williamson remarked that he might as well strike himself as his dog. Whether the deceased carried his threat to strike the dog into effect is not known, but the men soon afterwards closed, and a wrestle took place. At the conclusion of the wrestling, Williamson left the company of Glenning, but was followed by him. The result was that Williamson got possession of a stone of considerable size, and striking Glenning with it on the head, felled him to the ground. Having remained on the ground for some time in a state of unconsciousness, Glenning was lifted by his comrades and taken to a house in the vicinity, where he had his head bathed. This occurred about seven o'clock; and Glenning was so far recovered that he, along with his companions, left the house with the intention of going home. They had not proceeded far, however, when Glenning lay down on the road, at the side of a wall between St. Fort and Leuchars. There the two men who accompanied Glenning left him lying. At ten o'clock they returned, and found him in the same place, breathing heavily, and apparently in a sound sleep. Their efforts to rouse him proved ineffectual, and they again left him lying. On leaving him they went to his house, which was about half a mile away, and told his wife what had happened, but no efforts were made to have him removed to a more comfortable place. Nothing further transpired till about five o'clock on Saturday morning, when one of Glenning's companions of the previous evening went to the place and found him dead. An alarm was immediately given, and Dr. Constable, of Leuchars, was sent for. On his arrival, he had the body removed to the farm-steadings of Strathburn. Captain Bremner was also informed of the circumstances, and brought with him from Cupar, Dr. Bonnar, who, along with his professional brother, made a post-mortem examination of the body, which ended in an opinion that death resulted from the injury Glenning had received from the stone, the skull having been fractured. Captain Bremner apprehended Williamson on a charge of having murdered Glenning, and had him conveyed to Cupar, where on Saturday night he was examined before Sheriff Taylor, and stated that deceased had ill-used him, and that he had endeavoured to get away from him. Glenning, who was a stout man, about thirty-four years of age, was married, and leaves a wife and one child, the latter about three weeks old. Williamson is about twenty years of age, unmarried, has no parents, and belongs to the north-west of Fife. He was on Saturday committed to Cupar prison for further examination.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3206228605.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 786, "total-output-tokens": 768, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 3331, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
