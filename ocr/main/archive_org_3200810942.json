Coltman, an officer of the Mendicity Society, proved a long list of previous convictions. It was stated that prisoner walked into the police-station in the King's-road, Chelsea; and voluntarily gave himself up. He made a statement, which he subsequently put into writing, to the effect that he was afraid of being charged with stealing a coat from a house in which he was a lodger, and also for having obtained a sovereign by means of false pretences from Lady Rothschild's housekeeper. He was sentenced to nine months' hard labour.\u2014Charles Ottenan, forty, labourer, was also brought up to be dealt with as an incorrigible. Bosley, an officer of the Mendicity Society, described the prisoner as going about in a filthy condition, insulting persons who refused to give him money, and being very violent when arrested. There were nine previous convictions against him. He was sentenced to six months' hard labour.\n\nROBBERY FROM THE GREAT NORTHERN RAILWAY.\u2014Arthur Joseph Langshaw, twenty-six, painter, was indicted for having stolen a mantle, and also a box of eggs, the property of his masters, the Great Northern Railway Company. Mr. Kershaw prosecuted. The prisoner, who had been in the employ of the company as a labourer and carman, pleaded guilty. His duty was to take goods from the arrival platform to the engineers' department; but he had no right to take any other goods than those directed to that department. He had been suspected for some time, and on the 8th October was seen to take the box of eggs. Twenty-four pawntickets were found upon him, and among others one relating to the mantle. Others related to knives and forks, which had been stolen from luncheon baskets, and workmen's tools. He was sentenced to twelve months' hard labour.\n\nTHE EARL OF ROSSLYN'S LUGGAGE.\u2014George Jarvis, seventeen, groom, was indicted for having stolen two portmanteaus and other articles, value \u00a3200, the goods of the Earl of Rosslyn. On the 5th October a quantity of luggage, the property of the Earl of Rosslyn, was placed in a cab at the King's Cross Station, and the driver was ordered to drive to the Turf Club. There the person hiring the cab got out. Shortly afterwards the prisoner came out of the club and ordered the cabman to drive to Charing Cross. He then told him to drive on to an hotel in Villiers-street, and the goods were taken inside. The waiter at the hotel paid the cabman 4s. 6d., and the prisoner gave him 6d. Sergeant Parmenter, C Division, arrested the prisoner next day, and then found a quantity of the goods in Villiers-street and the remainder in a house in Percy-street, Tottenham-court-road. Prisoner's defence was that he had been led into it by another man. Sir P. H. Edlin sentenced him to six months' hard labour.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3200810942.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 1108, "total-output-tokens": 695, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 2879, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
