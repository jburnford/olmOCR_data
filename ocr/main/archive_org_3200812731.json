The men marched to the police-court headed by a band of music and a banner hung with crape. Mr. Greenwell, for the plaintiffs, stated that the men had laid the pit idle because of the funeral of a workman who died from injuries which he had received in the pit. Mr. Isadore Isaacs, solicitor to the Durham Miners' Association, on behalf of the men, stated that it was the custom on the occasion of a funeral under such circumstances for the pit to commence work two hours earlier than usual, so that the men might leave off early to attend the funeral. The plaintiffs denied this, and finally the magistrates found that the defendants had failed to prove the custom, and made an order for the damages claimed, with costs.\n\nAbout one hundred and forty miners employed at Lintz Colliery, West Durham, struck work on Saturday in consequence of a dispute as to the removal by the masters of certain workmen.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3200812731.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 2166, "total-output-tokens": 278, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 1138, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
