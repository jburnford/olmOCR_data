Since then, a large tract measuring 2,977 acres situated between the two streams of the Ghogra near Panian has been transferred to Azamgarh by virtue of a decree based on an agreement between the late Raja of Majhauli, proprietor of Painan, and M.

The largest of these is the Molony Bandh, an embankment 16 miles in length from the pontoon bridge near Bhawapar on the Rapti to Kuin Bazar, where high ground is met. It hugs the left or east bank of the river and was constructed as a famine relief work during the cold weather of 1906-07 and designed to protect the eastern kachar from the floods which have so often devastated it. The embankment varies from three to 12 feet in height with a minimum uniform breadth of four feet at the summit, save where it crosses the Lahsari nala, the channel excavated in a misguided attempt to drain the Ramgarh Tal; at this point it rises to a height of 30 feet and is some 12 feet wide on the crest. Besides this, roadside bandhs have been carried along the western side of the Azamgarh road from the pontoon bridge, round by the old distillery near Birdghat, and continued by the old Jail and Ilahi Bagh to the railway embankment near Domingarh.\n\n\"The construction of the Molony Bandh, while undoubtedly benefiting the eastern side of the river, has forced the water to take a more westerly course, and there is no doubt that more damage is now done by inundation than was formerly the case, and the water being headed up to some extent has forced its way across into the Ami valley to a greater degree than heretofore. Thus part of the old embankment of the Basti road between Birdghat and Kalesar was recently carried away owing to a southerly set of the river. This has necessitated a realignment of the road...\"\nfive miles from Gorakhpur, while the rest of the bandh has been considerably strengthened and extended as far as Sahjanwa; while a branch of this, known as the Bukhta Bandh, is carried from Kalesar as far as the railway embankment near the railway bridge over the Rapti, four miles east of Sahjanwa. These bands are all two feet above high flood level. There are other bandhs higher up the Rapti valley constructed by the owners of the Peppi Estates and other zamindars, but there has been no general scheme and the absence of this has deprived the works of much of their usefulness. Many villages are very anxious for bandhs to be made and are quite willing to pay a rate for this. It is however of no use making more isolated bandhs. What is required is a proper hydrographic survey of the valley of the Rapti to determine where bandhs should be made and what other training works are required. Mr. S. Athin, Superintending Engineer, was appointed to do this in February, 1916, but so late in the season that he was unable to touch more than the fringe of what was required. Stress of the war and consequent shortness of staff has since prevented anything further being done in this connection.\"\n\nPage 5, line 19 delete \"at the same time.\"\n\nFLOODS.\n\nPage 6, line 2 after \"recorded in 1889\" insert\u2014\n\n\"In the latter half of July 1910 the rainfall, especially in the north of the district, was exceedingly heavy. From the 16th to the 30th 25\u00b786 inches were accorded at the Mahrajgunj tahsil and there can be no doubt that very heavy falls occurred in the foothills of the Nepal Himalayas. As a result two large irrigation drains on the Peppi estate in the north of the Basti district burst and their contents went to swell the floods in the Rapti valley.\n\n\"Anxiety was first felt on the 27th June, when, following on falls in Mahrajganj of 3\u00b790 inches on the 23rd, 54 on the 24th, 6\u00b755 on the 25th, and 3\u00b764 on the 26th, the Rapti rose with great rapidity. By the 31st it reached its maximum, which was also the highest flood level on record. At the Sahjanwa railway bridge, the flood level was 253\u00b750 as compared with the previous record of 253\u00b725 on the 4th August, 1889, and at the\nIlahi Bagh sluice gates reached 16 feet 2 inches on the gauge, compared with 16 feet \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) inch the previous maximum.\n\n\"It was clear on the 27th July, that extraordinary efforts were necessary to prevent the water sweeping over the Azamgarh road and so flowing back in the city. A small roadside bandh was already in existence; this was rapidly strengthened and enlarged and eventually proved sufficient to prevent any encroachment east of the road. The Molony bandh however, which runs from the Azamgarh road to the village of Kulu, a distance of 16 miles along the left or east bandh of the Rapti, was seriously breached at the 13th mile. On the Tucker bandh on the main road to Azamgarh, at the first bridge, 14 miles from Gorakhpur, the water reached the roadway and the down-stream portion of one of the piers of the bridge fell in. For some time there seemed a possibility that at least one span of the bridge would be washed away, but the subsidence of the floods in the beginning of August enabled urgent repairs to be carried out and the bridge was eventually saved.\n\n\"Notwithstanding the enormous area covered by the floods, only one human being was drowned. Nor was the mortality among cattle serious. The grazing grounds were however under water for a considerable time and there was widespread loss of fodder. Some of the reserved forest blocks were thrown open to free grazing and passes for 13,200 cattle were issued for these areas.\n\n\"A small amount of relief was granted in the shape of doles of grain, the funds being obtained by public subscription and administered by committees in the affected tracts.\"\n\nPage 7, line 11, delete \"recently.\"\n\n,, 7, lines 13-15, delete \"A railway . . .

Thus there are only 31,028 acres actually barren and unfit for cultivation, nearly half of which consists of sterile sand along the course of the Ghagra in tahsils Bansgaon and Deoria. The balance shown as culturable is 535,152 acres; from this again must be deducted 64,082 acres of groves, 6,592 acres under preparation for sugarcane and 79,675 acres of new fallow, left temporarily untilled under the ordinary system of rotation.\n\n\"This leaves 161,123 acres of old fallow and 223,679 acres of unbroken waste, called banjar. The latter includes both Government and private forests and nearly two-thirds of it are to be found in Mahrajganj tahsil, and the bulk of the remainder is in Padrauna and Gorakhpur. Apart from the forests, there is a residue of nearly 90,000 acres occupied for the most part by scrub jungle and grass pasture. Of late years there has been a marked expansion of tillage; for the five years ending 1907-08 the area of banjar was 235,507 acres and of old fallow 187,822 acres thus within the last few years 38,527 acres have been brought into cultivation. Still the area of old fallow is far from negligible even in the southern tahsils, and in spite of the density of the population there can be no doubt that the district has by no means reached the limit of cultivation, and under favourable circumstances a still further expansion of tillage may be expected.\"\n\nPage 20, line 28, after \"Deputy Conservator\" read \"or Assistant Conservator.\"\n\nPage 21, line 6, for \"Ranges\" read \"forests.\"\n\nPage 21, line 11, delete \"and the only . . . uliginosa\" and insert \"and the most common trees are Jamun (Eugenia Jambolana), Paniari (Barringtonia acutangula), Panar (Randia uliginosa), Bhaisa (Salik tetrasperma) and Bhilla (Trewia nudiflora).\"\n\nLines 17 and 18, omit the words \"in the Northern and Central Ranges.\"\nPage 21, line 21, for \"103\u00b705 square miles\" read \"64,072 acres.\"\n\nPage 21, line 23 to page 24, line 31, for \"Big trees are scarce except perhaps in the north, etc,\" substitute \"Big trees are very scarce everywhere, as practically all the saleable material had been cut before the forests were reserved. There are a few large trees in the northern forests but most of them are unsound, knotty, and crooked, while in nearly every case they have been tapped for resin, a practice which has been disallowed since about 1860.\n\n\"The bulk of the crop has developed from the saplings and seedlings left by the timber contractors who worked in the forests before they were reserved. Most of these younger trees are sound and straight; the best specimens occur in Nagwa and Sonari forests and in the small Tulsi Ram block near Nichlau, but in many other parts the sal is of very fair quality and the sal forests generally are very promising. Natural reproduction is irregular but has increased considerably during the last few years. Over fairly large areas it is very good wherever the overhead cover is not too dense, but elsewhere it is held back by unfavourable soil conditions, grass and thick undergrowth of inferior species. The sal tends to disappear wherever the drainage is defective or the soil stiffens into heavy clay, even trivial depressions in the midst of the sal area often forming blanks devoid of seedlings. There is one enormous blank to the east of Nagwa forests, but this appears to owe its origin to the reclamation of the land for cultivation at a recent date. In the grass lands at the edge of the sal blocks there is sometimes an abundant growth of \"asna\" (Terminalia tomentosa). Other useful timbers that are found in the sal forests are Panan (Ougenina dalbergioides), Haldu or Karma (Adina cordifolia), Bijasal (Pterocarpus Marsupium), Kaim or Tikkoe (Stephegyne parvifolia) and Gambhar (Gmelina arborea). Miscellaneous forest is found on the intermediate levels but its extent is nowhere great save in Domakhand. The \"Jamun\" (Eugenia Jambolana) grows very freely along the banks of water courses but seldom attains in any size. Khair (Acacia catechu) is not uncommon in Dhomakhand and along the banks of the Piyas in Nagwa and Sonari and is occasionally exploited for the extraction of \"katha\" or \"catch.\"\n\"Semal (Bombax malabaricum) occurs throughout the forests and must at one time have been very common near the Gandak in the Domakhand reserve. Shisham (Dalbergia Sissoo) is also found as an indigenous species along the Gandak but is not common. It has been planted on a large scale in several other localities, notably at Sakhui in the south-west of Nagwa, where 2,080 acres of grass and fallow land were planted up between 1881 and 1885. Small experimental plantations of teak (Tectona grandis) have been made at different times and this tree is found to grow very well in Gorakhpur, although it is unlikely that it will ever yield timber of very large dimensions. Many other species occur but most of them are of little or no value as far as is known at present. The total number of species that have been found in the Gorakhpur forests, including trees, shrubs, and climbers, is 220. This number includes several only found further east as the Gorakhpur jungles (thanks apparently to the westerly course of the Great Gandak before reaching the district) seem to be the eastern boundary of many species found in the Eastern Sub-Himalaya jungles.\n\n**Management.**\n\n\"The forests are divided into seven Ranges, the charge of which is held by Rangers or Deputy Rangers subordinate to the Divisional Forest Officer. Foresters are attached to some of the larger ranges to assist in carrying out cultural operations, markings, and other special works, and the whole division is subdivided into 39 beats each being in the charge of a Forest Guard. During the working season an additional staff of expert moharrirs and chaprasis is entertained for supervising the contractors' work, and from March to June fire-watchers are employed. Fire conservancy was first started in 1875 and has been very successful. Owing to the damp climate and the annual cutting of the grass for thatching purposes fires do not often break out, while such outbreaks as do occur are easily controlled owing to the good system of firelines. These firelines were laid out in 1892 and 1893 and are cleared every year before the forests and the grass lands are dry enough to burn. The total length of the firelines is 134 miles and the average annual cost of fire-protection is about Rs. 2,500.\"\n\"Further protection is afforded by the numerous roads, aggregating 289 miles in length, which have been constructed by the department.\n\n\"There are rest-houses at Ramgarh, Campierganj, Pharenda, Surbar, Bhelampur, Banki, Pakri, Jagpur, Lachmipur, Tehrighat, Kushmahwa, Madhaulia, Dibhar, and Nichlaul.\n\n**EXPLOITATION.**\n\n\"Before the forests were reserved, the purchasers of the forest produce were at liberty to cut whatever and wherever they liked. In 1865 Mr. Tebber, Forest Surveyor, in his report on the condition of the Gorakhpur Government Forests, wrote that practically nothing remained except saplings and seedlings and a few old crooked and defective trees. Orders were given in 1863 that only unsound trees should be felled, but these orders were not properly enforced until some years later. From 1868 young untrained men without any experience of forest work were employed as forest officers to hold charge of the Gorakhpur Forest Division, the first being appointed in 1868. There is frequent reference in their annual reports to the extension of cultivation, which was evidently still going on in the Government Forest especially in Nagwa and East Lohra blocks. There was no definite scheme of management before 1874, the general policy at this period being merely to let the existing crop of young saplings and poles grow up into saleable material, and to realise a little revenue out of the sale of thatching grass and unsound trees and from grazing fees.\n\n\"The disposal of unsound trees was, however, effected by the permit system under which permit holders owing to inadequate supervision were able to cut large numbers of young sound trees and it was not until about 1883 that a final stop was put to this practice.\n\n**EARLY WORKING PLANS.**\n\n\"The first real working plan was complied in 1874, but this proved impracticable owing to the limited demand for forest produce and was cancelled in 1876, from which year to 1887 work was conducted on the lines of notes drawn up by Mr. Greigh; in 1887 a rough plan was drawn up but was not sanctioned, and the same fate attended plans submitted in 1889 and 1891.\"\nWORKING PLAN, 1893\u20141913.\n\n\"In 1893 a plan was submitted by Mr. Mercer, and Mr. Harsarup, in accordance with notes drawn up by Mr. Eardly-Wilmot. This was introduced simultaneously with a re-arrangement of the forest administration. The two existing ranges were divided into three: the Southern range, comprising, the forests of Ramgarh, Tilkonia, Bhelampur, Baaki, Bhari, Babban, Bhari Bhasi, Chhitahi, and West Lehra; the Central range, comprising East Lehra Forest, East Lehra Majhar, Dudhal Forest, and Dudhal Majhar; and the Northern range, formed out of the forests of Nagwa, Sonari, and Domakhand with the two small outlying tracts of Tenduba and Gopalganj. This working plan was written to cover a period of 20 years and in 1913-14 a new working was drawn up by Mr. Marriot in accordance with notes made by Mr. Clutterbuck, Conservator of Forests, and has been sanctioned by Government.\n\nPRESENT WORKING PLAN, 1914 onwards.\n\n\"It divides the forests into four working circles.\n\n\"Working circle I is sub-divided into W. C. I. A. (Ramgarh, Tilkonia, Bhilampur, and Banki Forest) and W. C. I. B. (Bhari, Babban, Bhari Baisi, Chhitani, and W. Lehra Forests). Working circle I is worked under a system of clear fellings, the regeneration of the cleared areas being obtained partly by natural and partly by artificial means. A great deal of attention is paid to the protection and tending of the young plants, and frequent thinnings and cleanings are prescribed in order to give the new crops every advantage. This intensive work in Working Circle I is made possible by the great demand that has grown up for produce of these forests owing to their isolated position in the middle of thickly-populated country and to good communications between them and Gorakhpur. They yield about Rs. 10 per acre per annum at present and are perhaps the only forests in India in which it is practicable as yet to adopt an intensive system of management that almost comes up to European standard. The forests of working circle Ib are not being regularly worked at present, as they suffered very much from drought in 1910, and re-generation in them is in a backward state.\"\nEventually it is intended to work them similarly to the forests in working circle Ia, as their close proximity to the railway ensures a good demand for all the produce they can yield.\n\nWorking Circle II includes the large sal forests in Dudhai, East Lehra, Nagwa, and Sonari blocks, which have gradually been growing up into valuable forests during the last half century; fellings having been restricted, ever since they were first reserved in 1855 to 1863, to the removal of decayed and valuable trees. Under the present working plan, overmature and crooked trees are being removed as well as unsound trees and these yield a large quantity of serviceable timber although of somewhat poor quality. Forestry is to a great extent a question of communications, and when the proposed new branch railway lines are opened it will be possible to work the Government sal forest in the north of the district as intensively as those in Working Circle I.\n\nWorking Circle III consists of the extensive grass lands of East Lehra Majhar, and Dudhai Majhar, which are reserved primarily for the sake of pasturage and yield no revenue except from grazing and thatching grass.\n\nWorking Circle IV is the Doma Khand block in the northeast of the district which, except for two small patches of sal forest, consists of miscellaneous forest and grass land. Most of this area is leased until 1919 and the rest is merely being protected for the time being, and yields practically no revenue.\n\nRANGES.\n\nThe 1914 working plan also introduced a redistribution of the forests into Ranges which now number seven instead of three as before. The Ranges, each of which is in the charge of a Ranger or Deputy Ranger with headquarters at the place which gives its name to the Range, are as follows:\n\n1. Tilkonia Range.\u2014Ramgarh Tilkonia, Bhelampur, and Banki forests.\n\n2. Campierganj Range\u2014Bhari Babban, Bhari Baisi, Chhitahi, and West Lehra forests.\n\n3. Pakri Range (Dudhai forest and Dudhai Majhar).\n\n4. Lachhipur Range\u2014East Lehra forest and East Lehra Majhar).\n\"5. Chouk Sakhui Range, with headquarters at Chouk, Western part of Nagwa and Sonari forest.\n\n\"6. Madhaulia Range\u2014Eastern part of Nagwa and Sonari forests and Tenduana.\n\n\"7. Nichlaul Range\u2014Domakhand and Gopalganj. There are no rights of any kind in the forests. Grazing is permitted on payment over an area of 35,200 acres, the total number of cattle that were grazed in 1915-16 being 33,330 excluding a large number which graze in the Domakhand leased forest and are not enumerated.\n\n\"REVENUE.\n\n\"The chief product of the forests is sal in the shape of timber and fuel. The demand is mainly for metre gauge and light railway sleepers, for building timber, including poles of two to three and a half ft. in girth which are in strong demand, and firewood, much of which is used in the sugar factories of the district.\n\n\"As the population is growing and the Zamindari forests disappearing, the local demand for forest produce from the Government forests is always on the increase. At the same time the yield from the Government forests is much greater now than in former years and a quantity of produce is exported to Dinapore, Chapra, Benares, Lucknow, Cawnpore, and other towns in the east of the United Provinces and in Bihar. The sale of thatching grass brings in about Rs. 45,000 per annum, while grazing fees, fish, bamboos, and wild fruits help appreciably to swell the total revenue. The financial results of the forest management have improved regularly and rapidly from the time when Government was in doubt whether the Gorakhpur forests were worth preserving to the present day when they are almost the best paying forests in India; the gross revenue having risen steadily from Rs. 5,235 in 1862-3 to Rs. 3,34,269 in 1914-15 and the gross annual expenditure having increased from Rs. 2,660 to Rs. 57,042 only during the same period. The financial prospects for the future are very promising, as the demand is always going up and most parts of the forests are now well stocked with timber the quality of which will steadily improve with the removal of the trees which were damaged before the forests were brought under proper management. The great need is for better railway communications for\nthe forests in the north of the district. The surveys for three new branch lines have already been made and work would have been started on them by now but for the war.\" Page 25, lines 5 to 7, for \"The only, Gorakhpur\" read \"A considerable area or sal belonging to the Mian Sahib remains intact at Kusmahi, nine miles east of Gorakhpur. There is good sal in Jungle Farzand Ali belonging to the Majhauli Estate, which with another jungle village (Hathi Hathsar) has been leased to the Forest department. There are also somewhat extensive private sal forests south and west of the Banki Government forest, on which however considerable inroads have recently been made. The most extensive area of private forest is on the east side of the Great Gandak, where five villages belonging to the Bettia Estate are almost entirely forest. Their management has recently been made over to the Bettia Estate Forest Officer whose headquarters are at Bagaha in the Champaran district.\"\n\nPage 25, lines 20 to 31, delete \"Since the... much importance\" and substitute \"Since the Settlement there has been a considerable decrease, the area occupied by groves in 1908-09 being only 63,285 acres. Old groves were destroyed and converted to agricultural purposes. The chief reason for this undoubtedly was the demand on the part of sugar-refiners for wood as fuel. The wholesale destruction of all groves in the south-east of the district was only prevented by the sale of sal wood from the reserved forests, which was found to be better than mango wood as fuel. But as the blocks where the thinning out and replanting of trees took place gradually receded from the railway, the cost of sal wood steadily increased owing to higher cartage and as the demand for fuel continued to increase, there was a steady decline in the grove area of the district. There are however signs that this process has now stopped. Coal is being increasingly used as fuel, especially at Rampur Karkhana, while the extension of the railway has brought many blocks of the reserved forest nearer to the railway line. Accordingly, there has been a marked growth in the number of new plantations within the last few years. The average area covered by groves during the five years ending 1912-13 is 64,082 acres, while the actual figure for 1912-13 is 64,918 acres.\n\n\"The only tahsil which shows a steady decrease in the grove\narea during the last five years is Bansgaon.

This high figure shows signs of increase rather than decrease; for from 1911 to 1914 the disease was responsible for 10,697 deaths annually. Plague is worst in the south of the district; so far it has not penetrated the Mahrajganj tahsil or the north of Padrauna. The city has suffered severely and is now almost deserted when plague attacks any of the mohallas. Few effective measures have been taken to eradicate the disease, for evacuation has seldom been complete and disinfection has never been popular.\n\n\"The policy of killing rats was in vogue from 1907 to 1910, but was then given up, as it was not found practicable. At the end of 1913, fumigation was resorted to in several mohallas of the city, but there was considerable public opposition and only some 696 houses were actually fumigated. Besides, it was found impracticable to remove the grain bins or to get at the rats in the roofs and the large number of ruined houses was an additional difficulty.\n\n\"For these reasons the experiment met with but indifferent success and the mortality from plague in 1914 was as much as 12,865\u2014a figure which was only surpassed in 1910, the figure for which year was 14,980.

The relative proportion varies greatly in different parts of the district, more than half the total kharif is to be found in the two tahsils of Maharajganj and Padrauna, though the rabi is more evenly distributed. In Padrauna the proportion of kharif to rabi is as 100 to 61, and an almost equally marked preponderance is to be found in Maharajganj, in spite of the fact that of recent years the increase in the rabi has been nearly double that in the kharif, in fact the proportion of autumn to spring crops in Maharajganj was \u00b755 for the 10 years ending 1907-08 as compared with 64 for the five following years. In the Hata tahsil too the kharif covers decidedly the larger area, the rabi being \u00b781 of the kharif, but in Deoria the difference is very slight, the ratio being \u00b797, while in Gorakhpur and Bansgaon, and especially the latter, owing to the wide expanse of kachhar the rabi takes the leading price in all but\nmost exceptional reasons. It must however be noticed that of late years the proportion of rabi to kharif has decreased in both these tahsils the figures for the five years ending 1912-13 being 1\u00b711 and 1\u00b731 respectively, as compared with 1\u00b714 and 1\u00b733 for the proceeding decade.\"\n\nPage 45, line 26.\n\nDOUBLE CROPPING.\n\nAlter \"705,662\" into \"729,185.\"\n\n\"34\u00b72\" \"33\u00b79.\"\n\nPage 46, line 4\u2014\n\nAlter \"some 24\" into \"26\u00b78.\"\n\nPage 46, lines 16 to 24 delete \"but since the . . . in the district\" and substitute\u2014\n\n\"RICE.\n\n\"Thereafter a remarkable expansion occurred and for the five years ending 1907-08 the average area under rice was no less than 955,236 acres, or 62 per cent. of the entire kharif, the area under this crop in 1906-07 being 1,028,251 acres.

The decline of the last five years is most apparent in Padrauna and Deoria, where the proportions have decreased from 45\u00b76 and 37\u00b73 per cent. to 41\u00b72 and 33\u00b77 per cent. respectively.\"\n\nPage 47, lines 7 to 14 delete \"The present . . . total kharif,\" and substitute\u2014\n\n\"KODON.\n\n\"It is generally sown either in combination with rice or with arhar; the statistics do not discriminate between these crops; the kodon-rice combination is generally passed off as rice, while the kodon-arhar mixture and kodon alone are shown together. The present average area of the latter is 269,294 acres or 17\u00b71 per cent. of the kharif; in 1908-09 the area reached the surprising figure of 361,741 acres. For the five years ending 1907-08 the area sown with kodon alone is given as 162,878 acres; no separate\nstatistics are available for the kodon-arhar combination which was doubtless sometimes included in kodon and at others in arhar. Accordingly the gigantic increase shown in the area under kondon is accompanied by a decrease in both arhar and rice. But even allowing for a certain amount of confusion there can be no doubt the last few years have witnessed a substantial increase in the area sown with kodon and kodon-arhar. This increase is most marked in the Deoria tahsil; the average area five years ago was only 24,002 acres, while the present figure is 65,360 acres or 34\u00b73 per cent. of the total kharif area of the tahsil. In Hata also the area covered by this crop has increased from 10,900 to 28,745 acres. In the Gorakhpur tahsil it covers 44,878 acres or 23\u00b74 per cent. of the kharif; while the largest area is to be found in Padrauna, where it occupies 73,483 acres though here it only amounts to 19\u00b74 per cent. of the total kharif for the tahsil.\"\n\nPage 47, lines 20 to 27, delete \"Maize is now . . . of the east\" and substitute\u2014\n\n\"MAIZE.\n\n\"Maize is now a very important staple, at least in some parts of the district, the present average being 116,840 acres, or 7\u00b739 per cent. of the kharif.

The present area under maize is double the figures recorded in 1888, but the last 10 years show practically no increase in this area; in fact the area under maize in Padrauna has decreased from 61,311 acres annually for the five years ending 1\u00b70\u00b703 to 58,967 acres at the present time.

The bulk of the remainder is to be found in Hata, Deoria, and Maharajganj, but while the area in Deoria has of late decreased that in Maharajganj has shown a large extension; it has increased there from 5,478 acres annually for the five years ending 1902-03 to 7,112 acres in the next quinquennial period and 12,608 acre at the present time, the area having been thus more than doubled in 10 years.\"\n\nPage 48, end of line 10, mark the word \"area\" with a star and give the following footnote in small type:\n\n\"Note.\u2014The actual village in which the data forming the basis of this note were obtained was Sonbarsa, near Hata; but the results are probably widely applicable. The maund in use (referred to as 'md.V') is one of 28 gandas of rupees or 112 tolas Government weight. The various operatives concerned in the work are\u2014\n\n\"The Pakwaha, he who superintends the boiling of the juice, and keeps up the fire.\n\n\"The Murwaha, he who puts the cane into the mill.\n\n\"The Katarwaha, he who drives the bullocks, and, in the case of a wooden sugar mill, sits on the shaft thereof.\n\n\"The payments made by a cultivator who uses his own bullocks to work the mill are as follows:\u2014\n\n\"To the carpenter who makes and repairs the mill; to the Pakwaha and to the murwaha, each one maund (V) of gur after every 24 retained by the cultivator, the Pakwaha and Murwaha also each receive Re. 1 in cash. To the Katarwaha Rs. 2 in cash per month with food and some clothes, or say equivalent to annas 2 per day. For cutting, stripping, and bringing to the mill enough cane for one mill:\u2014\n\n\"Four men at about three Gorakhpuri pice per day in cash with parched rice, cane-juice, etc., reckoned at about equivalent to six annas Government coin per day. The boiling pan (karah) used to cost about Rs. 6 before the war, but was then (1917) reckoned to cost about Rs. 10. It lasts eight or 10 seasons. In addition to these charges the zamindar levies a charge of from Re. 1 to Rs. 2.8 per mill; this is known as kolhuwana. Thus as the\ntotal expenses in producing 24 mds. V of gur from his own cane we have, (the rate of production being approximately one maund V per mill per day).\n\n| Gur. | Cash. |\n|------|-------|\n| Carpenter | 1 Md.

V |\n\nor, converting to Government weight, we have as the cost to the cultivator of producing $24 \\times \\frac{112}{80}$ standard maunds of gur the value of $3 \\times \\frac{112}{80}$ maund + Rs. 16. If now we put A as the price in rupees of 1 maund (Government) of gur we have at the cost of producing that one maund in rupees:\n\n$$\\frac{21A + 80}{168}$$\n\nDetails of calculation are \u2014 cost is \u2014\n\n$$\\frac{3A \\times \\frac{112}{80} + 16}{24 \\times \\frac{112}{80}} = \\frac{21A/5 + 16}{24 \\times \\frac{7}{8}} = \\frac{21A + 80}{168}.$$ \n\nIn this village it is stated that from 8 to 10 maunds of cane are required to produce a maund of gur. If we take the higher figure the value of 10 maunds of cane is the price of the gur less the cost of production or $A \\left( \\frac{21A + 80}{168} \\right)$ or $\\left( \\frac{47A - 80}{168} \\right)$ rupees. Thus the cane is worth to the cultivator $\\frac{147A - 8}{168}$ rupees per maund or in annas $(7A/5 - '76)$ or very nearly $7A/5$ annas less 9 pics.\n\n\"If the cultivator has to hire bullocks to work the mill the system is precisely similar save that in this case the carpenter, pakwaha, and murwaha are said to be to receive the same payments after every 20 mds. V and that for the bullocks 4 mds. V are paid after every 20 mds. V. retained by the cultivator; the payment for the bullocks however includes the pay of the katarwaha. Allowing the same amounts for cutting, stripping, and other items as in the former case we have as the total cost of producing 20 mds. V the value of 7 mds. V of gur plus Rs. 12-10, whence the cost to the cultivator of 1 md.

In some villages it would seem the pakwaha is paid more liberally, getting, for example, in addition to what has been above noted, another 10 seers of gur for every 23 bullocks, and a daily payment of two sugarcanes and a quarter seer of gur; or occasionally in lieu of the additional 10 seers of gur a cash payment of twelve annas. The details will vary from village to village. Similarly, also the yield of gur per maund of cane will vary considerably and that given as current in Sonbarsa would appear from later information to be probably above the average which is nearer 10 or 12 mds. of cane per maund of gur. Expert opinion as regards the comparative merits of the wooden and iron kolhus points to the probability that the iron kolhu does not extract a greater percentage of juice, but merely enables a greater quantity of cane to be crushed, and that is the explanation of the greater production of gur per day when it is used.\"\n\nPage 48, lines 13 and 14, delete \"By itself it... more frequently\" and substitute\u2014\"Usually,\"\n\nARHAR.\n\nPage 48, lines 20 to 25 delete \"The average... and Bansgaon.\"\n\nPage 48, line 26 alter \"The crop\" to \"It.\"\n\n,, 48, lines 36 to 38 delete \"On the whole... this crop\" and substitute\u2014\n\n\"The mixture of kodon and arhar has already been dealt with, while the combination of arhar and rice is invariably entered as rice only.

At the seventh settlement, about 1865, the total area was 546,227 acres, the figure rising to 578,008 acres in 1891 and to 674,544 at the last settlement, the increase being attributed mainly to the reclamation of the land from forests. The last year however would seem to have been an exceptionally favourable rabi season, for between 1878 and 1889 the average area devoted to cereals was only 552,725 acres. Since then the total area under cereals has steadily increased, though it has not kept pace with the expansion of the rest of the rabi crops. Thus for the five years ending 1902-03 the proportion of cereals was 52\u00b78 per cent. of the entire rabi and for the next quinquennial period it was 52 per cent., the present figure being only 50\u00b79 per cent. This is doubtless due to the increase in the popularity of various miscellaneous crops. Maharajganj is the only tahsil in which the area under cereals shows a considerable increase.\n\n\"GUJAI.\n\n\"Among cereals by far the largest area is occupied by the mixture of wheat and barley known as Gujai, averaging 304,266 acres. If the old returns can be accepted, there would appear to have been an immense increase in the Gujai area, for at last settlement the total was only 211,875 acres, while, for the five years ending 1907-08 the average area under Gujai was 309,433 acres, or 25\u00b75 per cent. of the spring harvest, in spite of the fact that the last year showed an abnormally small area under Gujai. As the crop at present constitutes only 23\u00b77 per cent. of the rabi, it is clear there has been a considerable decrease in the last five years. In Maharajgunj it constitutes only 16\u00b73 per cent. of the rabi crop of the tahsil; in Bansgaon, on the other hand Gujai covers 58,994 acres, or 31\u00b77 per cent. of the spring harvest of the tahsil, while in Deoria the corresponding figures are no less than 66,644 acres and 36\u00b71 per cent.\n\n\"BARLEY.\n\n\"Next to Gujai comes barley, which occupies an average area of 191,134 acres, or 14\u00b78 per cent. of the entire rabi, the highest proportion being 17\u00b77 per cent. in Deoria, followed by 16\u00b72 per cent. in the Gorakhpur tahsil. Of recent years the area occupied by pure barley seems to have decreased; the returns of the last settlement showed 246,795 acres under this crop;\nthis figure was doubtless incorrect, though in the year 1907-08 we again find barley covering an area of 246,894 acres, and exceeding even the Gujai area for that year. Apart, however, from these exceptions, only 10 years ago barley constituted 16\u00b71 per cent. of the entire rabi. The decline is most marked in the Padrauna tahsil, where for the five years ending 1902-03 the average area covered by barley was 54,775 acres as compared with 35,064 acres at the present time.\n\n\"There can be no doubt that barley is being gradually replaced by wheat in this tahsil. In the Gorakhpur tahsil, on the other hand, the reverse tendency is noticeable, the area under barley actually showing an appreciable increase; while Maharajganj shows an increase in both barley and wheat.\n\n\"WHEAT.\n\n\"The area under wheat alone has increased within the last few years. The present average area is 159,853 acres, or 12\u00b74 per cent. of the spring harvest, as compared with 139,726 acres or 11\u00b75 per cent. only five years ago. In 1878 the recorded area under wheat was 135,574 acres; at the last settlement this had risen to 215,837 acres; as the highest wheat area within recent years is only 175,713 acres, it seems pretty certain the former figures are not to be relied on; confusion was doubtless caused by the extensive practice of growing mixed rabi crops. The proportion of wheat is highest in the Padrauna tahsil, where it amounts to 18\u00b71 per cent., followed by the Gorakhpur tahsil with 14\u00b78 per cent. In Deoria the area under wheat alone is practically negligible, Gujai being the popular crop. Apart from this, wheat is pretty evenly distributed, the wheat of pargana Hasanpur Maghur and of Unaula being specially celebrated. The hard white wheats do not flourish in this district, the best results being obtained with the soft red varieties, for which there is no great demand in the export trade.\"\n\n\"PEAS.\n\nPage 51, lines 31 to 34, delete \"altogether . . . a figure\" and substitute\u2014\n\n\"Altogether it averages 237,954 acres, or 18\u00b74 per cent. of the harvest, the highest proportion being 28\u00b75 per cent. in the\nDeoria tahsil, followed closely by 28\u00b72 per cent. in Hata.\"\n\nPage 51, last line, at end of paragraph insert\u2014\n\n\"In 1907-08 there was a sudden fall to 108,813 acres, but succeeding years were more favourable, and in 1911-12 the crop occupied an area of as much as 333,633 acres.

An unexpected break in the rains in the fourth week of June caused considerable anxiety, but the situation was saved by a heavy downpour in July. The total rainfall was however much below the normal, being 23.77 inches against an average of 44.84 inches, while its uneven distribution combined with its abrupt stoppage in September practically destroyed the late rice and caused considerable damage to the early variety also. Advances amounting to Rs. 82,000 were distributed for the purchase of cattle and seed for rabi sowings and for the digging of kachha wells for irrigation purposes. Suspensions and remissions of revenue were also granted to the extent of Rs. 21,400. Thanks to these prompt measures, the people were able to push on with the rabi sowings as soon as the temperature had come down to germination point at the end of October. November and December were rainless, but the subsequent rainfall in the early months of 1908 materially benefitted the late-sown rabi; and the suspension of the second instalment of the revenue was less than Rs. 5,000. Owing to high prices, there was considerable distress, but work was plentiful and no test works were opened. Generally speaking, the monsoon of 1907 resembled that of 1896, but the distress was much less acute, partly owing to a few opportune showers in September, and partly to the better organization and preparedness of the district staff and the prompt measures taken.\"\n\n**PRICES.**\n\nPage 66, line 35\u2014page 67, line 10, delete \"subsequent seasons ... year to 1905\" and substitute\u2014\n\n\"Subsequent seasons were unfavourable and prices rose rapidly, till in 1907-8 they exceeded scarcity rates. Thanks however to the excellent harvests of 1908 and following years, prices again fell, reaching their lowest level in 1911, but even so they never reached the 'normal' rates. Since then they have risen very sharply and in 1915 they were higher than ever before. Doubtless a return to normal conditions will entail a fall in prices, but it is doubtful if the recovery will ever be complete. The prices fixed as normal for the district some years ago seem to have become obsolete and are not likely in the future to be\nanything but abnormal. The average for the 10 years ending 1915 is 9\u00b746 seers of rice, 10\u00b796 seers of wheat, 15\u00b771 of barley, 10\u00b7787 of arhar, and 13\u00b796 of gram to the rupee. Thus in the last 10 years prices have risen by 21 per cent. or, on the whole in the past 55 years, they have risen 23 per cent. from 1861 to 1885, 46 per cent. from the former year to 1905, and 57 per cent. from 1861 to 1915.\"\n\nWAGES.\n\nPage 67, line 14 to page 68, line 9, delete the whole paragraph on wages and substitute\u2014\n\n\"Throughout the district, wages rule much lower than those prevailing in the western parts of the United Provinces, the scale being that of the eastern districts generally; in the last five years however they have risen very sharply. Early records of wages are not available, but it would appear that from 1858 to 1868 the remuneration of field labourers remained at the same level, varying from six to eight pice daily, although cash wages were relatively rare. During the next decade the higher rate generally prevailed, though from 1878 to 1908 the district average was still from six to eight pice; the present average is however from eight to ten pice, and cash remuneration takes the form of the so-called \"Gorakhpuri pice\" and amounts from 10 to 15 of these coins daily, the equivalent in Government currency being two and three annas. In practice however payment is usually made partly in cash and partly in kind; when paid wholly in kind, it varies from two to three seers. The rate of course depends on the locality and the nature of the work performed; wages are generally higher in the north, the average being three annas a day, for labour is less abundant there. Digging and irrigation with the large wooden shovel used for distributing the water are paid more highly than weeding and water drawing. During harvest time the labourer often gets from three annas six pies to four annas a day, mostly in kind; ordinarily it is every sixteenth sheaf, usually the largest and best being chosen. The scale is of course lower for the regular retainers of the zamindar, who gives them constant employment throughout the year and supplements the cash remuneration or two annas per day with various extras, such as a daily dole of grain, a blanket in the cold...\"\nweather or a few maunds of gram at harvest; five years ago they were content with one anna a day, but now they are scarce even at the higher rate.\n\n\"The ordinary ploughman now demands not only Rs. 2 a month in cash, but also a plot of land a couple of bighas in extent free of rent. This reflects a general tendency towards greater independence and social progress, the labourer wishing to become a cultivator. The rise in wages is not confined to the unskilled labourer; even in rural tracts the wages of the carpenter, the blacksmith, and the mason have risen from three annas to five annas per day, while in the towns they usually get from six to eight annas daily. A similar rise is to be noticed in the case of the household servant; for instance, in 1907 the average monthly pay of a sweeper was Rs. 3 and a syce Rs. 5; these have now increased to Rs. 5 and Rs. 7 respectively. The foremost reason for this increase is of course the rise in prices, which has already been noticed, culminating in the scarcity of 1907-08. Before this wages had been unduly low and the scarcity brought about a long-delayed and necessary change by bringing matters to a head and forcing up wages, and there is little likelihood of their ever going down again to their former level. The increase of emigration owing to the higher wages obtainable in Bengal and elsewhere, the ravages of plague and increased facilities of transport have also tended to increase wages in this district, and so has the greater demand for labourers due to the requirements of the railway workshops and the increase in the number of sugar factories. A further rise in wages during the next decade is to be expected.\"\n\nPage 68, line 19 for \"are\" read \"were,\" page 69, line 11 to page 70, line 8. Delete from\u2014\"Now the . . .\" to \"a gon,\" and substitute\u2014\n\n\"The basis of the weights is the ganda (properly a handful, but usually interpreted as meaning a set of four) of Gorakhpuri pice. A varying number, whole or fractional, of gandas was taken to form a local seer (which is more often than not different for different commodities also). Apart from the fact that when now the weight of these pice is by no means constant, as they have ceased to be coined, the supply of full weight ones is very\nshort and short weight pice are therefore used; this is apparently sometimes remedied by adding more pice to make the weight up to that of the original seer, than that increased number is used as the basis of a new seer and so on. On top of this system the 180-grain rupee has come, and as a result seers of various numbers of gandas or rupees have come into use, the rupee being by some regarded as equal to the pice in weight and by others not so, the usual ratio being apparently seven pice equal to five rupees. The result is the utmost confusion. Expressed in gandas the seers are almost innumerable, while when converted into terms of standard tolas each seer develops into several more according to the ratio assumed as existing between the gandas of pice and rupees.\n\n\"Matters are further complicated by the use of other standards which may not unfairly be said to be intermediate between measures of capacity and of weight. These are as complicated as the measures of weight just described, and are in fact based more or less directly thereon, the sei or sayee being supposed to be a measure that would contain a local seer of grain, usually rice. The variations of the sei are therefore as manifold as those of the local seer. In addition there is a measure known as rajia, which appears to be sometimes merely an alternative name for the sei, and at others a separate measure equal to $1\\frac{1}{2}$ sei.\"\n\nPage 70, line 23 after \"closely\" insert\u2014\n\n\"Much confusion in local land measures was caused by the custom of enhancing rents by decreasing the length of the lathas whereby the bigha was measured.\"\n\nPage 70, line 29.

The number of societies once rose as high as 350, but owing to a change in the policy of the Co-operative Department all affiliated societies had to be re-organised into independent units. This work is now nearly complete, and there are 156 'independent' societies, excluding 42 affiliated societies of the old type which will also shortly be re-organised. Several unsatisfactory societies have been closed and efforts are being made to open others in their place. The stability of the bank lies in the fact that it has now accumulated a strong Reserve Fund amounting to Rs. 24,000, a bad and doubtful debt fund amounting to Rs. 7,000 both of which are invested in Government of India war loan and G.

These comprise Gorakhpur, Goura-Barhaj (these two towns being administratively one), Rudarpur, Padrauna (including Sahibganj), Lar, Bansgaon, and Salempur-Majhauli. The urban population including that of these towns and also of Siswa, Bansgaon, Rampur, Karkhana, Paina, Gola, Barhalganj, Pipraich, and Deoria amounted to 136,872, or 4\u00b728 per cent. of the whole\u2014as compared with 1\u00b75 per cent. in Basti and 3\u00b79 per cent. in Gonda. The urban population shows a remarkable decrease, for it was 5\u00b74 per cent. in 1901. Apart from the city of Gorakhpur, the population of which owing to plague and cholera has been diminished by 7,256, there is a marked decline in the population of towns like Paina, Gola, and Barhalganj on the Ghagra\u2014pointing to a decrease in importance of the river-borne traffic...\"\nGaura-Barhaj, however, shows an increase which is probably due to its position on the railway rather than on the river. Other towns which show an increase are Siswa and Deoria, both on the railway, and Bansgaon which has now been connected with Gorakhpur by a metalled road, though the increase in Deoria and Bansgaon is mainly due to their administrative importance. The larger villages are fairly numerous, being, as a rule, local centres of commerce which are likely to grow in the near future. The majority of the villages are, however, small as is the case throughout the eastern districts, though the last ten years show a decided tendency for the villagers to increase; the average population is 406 as compared with 370 in 1901, while the percentage of inhabitants residing in villages of less than 500 persons has decreased from 43\u00b74 to 38 per cent. as compared with the provincial average of 34\u00b74 per cent. The figures for the district would certainly be greater but for the fact that in the north the area of the mauzas is often extremely large\u2014such villages containing within their limits great numbers of petty hamlets, each of which represents a separate clearing and settlement in the forest.\"\n\nSex.\n\nPage 91, delete \"of the whole population . . . preponderance of females\" lines 13 to 26 and substitute\u2014\n\n\"Of the whole population 1,604,635 were males and 1,596,545 females, the latter comprising 49\u00b788 per cent. of the total as contrasted with 50\u00b73 per cent. in 1901. The relative proportion seems to be fairly constant, as the proportion of females was 49\u00b798 in 1891 and 50\u00b709 in 1881. The corresponding figures in 1872 were 46\u00b76 per cent. in 1865, 47\u00b703 per cent. and 47\u00b76 per cent. in 1853, though these figures were probably vitiated in part by concealment. The Sadar and Mahrajganj tahsils have always shown an excess of males as in other districts north of the Ghagra. Deoria and Hata seem to vary, but in Padrauna and Bansgaon there is a preponderance of females as in the Benares division to the South.\"\n\nPage 91, line 35, delete \"While the same thing occurs\" and substitute \"The same thing occurring.\"\n\nLine 36, after \"Musalmans\" insert \"While the Gonds and\"\nChamars show a very decided preponderance of females, the proportion of females among the Gonds being as high as 51\u00b74 per cent.\"\n\n**Migration.**\n\nPage 92, lines 3 to 39, delete the whole paragraph on migration and substitute\u2014\n\n\"The 1911 census figures of migration in this district show an excess of immigrants who number 152,000; of these, 130,000, or 85\u00b75 per cent., come from contiguous districts and five per cent. from countries outside India. The number of emigrants is stated as only 136,000, of whom nearly 88,000, or 65\u00b77 had gone to the adjoining districts and the rest to various parts of India, 75 per cent. of the latter being males. This emigration is undoubtedly in search of labour; numbers of labourers betake themselves for several months every year to Bengal and Assam, Calcutta, Howrah, and even Rangoon, earning high wages from October to the beginning of the rains. The volume of such immigration is however small in comparison with that from all parts of the Benares division, in which labour is more abundant and the pressure of the population on the land is far more severe. These emigrants go by river as well as by rail, and for this reason exact figures are unobtainable, but in an ordinary year the number is about 10,000, though in seasons of high prices and agricultural distress it may rise to three times that figure. As the last 10 years have been more favourable economically than the preceding decade, the proportion of internal emigration has decreased; of all the persons enumerated in India who gave Gorakhpur as their birthplace 4\u00b746 per cent. were found elsewhere in 1901, but only 4\u00b727 per cent. in 1911. Of course there are no means of ascertaining the period in which this emigration took place, but it must be pointed out that the census figures are misleading, for the very considerable emigration to Nepal has not been included; this may be estimated at about 40,000.\n\n\"Further, a certain amount of overseas emigration comes from this district, though the volume of this is relatively small amounting to only 846 persons annually. At any rate, it seems, certain the district has not really gained more by immigration\nthan it has lost by emigration. In 1891, eight per cent. of the inhabitants of the district were born elsewhere, but in 1901 the proportion was only $4.15$ per cent.: the last decade indeed shows a rise to $4.73$ per cent., but the proportion of natives continues to be greater than in almost any other part of the United Provinces, which however is probably mainly due to the large area of the district and consequent low ratio of length of boundary to area.\"\n\nPage 93, line 2, delete \"2,658,074 . . . of other religions\" and substitute\u2014\n\n\"2,875,402, or 89.82 per cent. were Hindus, 322,946, or 10.09 per cent. were Musalmans and 2,832 of other religions.\"\n\nPage 93, line 6, delete \"considerable.\"\n\n,, 95, lines 17 to 19.\n\nLine 13 after \"marriage\" add \"and also of course to the legality of widow remarriage.\"\n\nfor 14.7 substitute .. .. .. .. 15.03\n\n11.7 ditto .. .. .. .. 11.91\n\n9.3 ditto .. .. .. .. 8.62\n\n8.4 ditto .. .. .. .. 8.59\n\n8.1 ditto .. .. .. .. 8.01\n\n6.1 ditto .. .. .. .. 6.14\n\nPage 33, line 22, for \"last census\" substitute \"census of 1901.\"\n\nPage 93, line 35, for \"nearly\" substitute \"over.\"\n\n,, 94, lines 2 to 10, delete \"Altogether . . . in each case\" and substitute\u2014\n\n\"Altogether exclusive of 24,239 persons whose caste was not specified, representatives of 75 different castes were found apart from sub-divisions.

Some of the Brahmans of the district are called Sawalakhis; the story being told that a king of Benares gave a feast to 125,000 Brahmans, but that as the requisite number was not forthcoming, he made requisitions on other tribes and gave them Brahmanical rank. The Sarwarias themselves indignantly deny that this refers to any of their sub-divisions. According to their own accounts, Sarwaria is a Sanskrit word meaning the most respected; in support of this interpretation they allege the fact that the Pankti pavans, who are to be found only among the Sarwarias, are given the foremost place among Brahmans in the Manusmit. Their legends say that the whole tract north of the Ghagra, bounded by the Great Gandak on the east and the Ramrikha on the west was given to their ancestors by Ram Chandra on his return from Ceylon, for conducting the great sacrifice. Hence they are sometimes called Sarjuparis or inhabitants of the country north of the Ghagra, though they are now to be found in other parts of the country also. They are foremost among the land-owning castes of the district and hold a large area as tenants, but their skill and industry in agriculture are by no means conspicuous. Like all Brahmans, they are handicapped by the fact that they are forbidden to handle the plough; and their other caste rules especially those regarding\nfood and marriage. According to their traditions the most ancient settlements are those of the Tiwaris in Gorakhpur itself and in Pidi in Deoria; the Shukuls in Bhendi of pargana Silhat; the Dubes of Sarar in pargana Haveli Gorakhpur; the Misras of Baisi and Payasi in the same pargana, and the Bhargavas of Singanjori in Padrauna, who have removed there recently from Bhagalpur on the Ghagra, while the other sub-castes are the Upadhya, Panday, Chaubes, Pataks, and Ojhas.\n\nKURMIS AND SAINTHWARS.\n\nPage 96, lines 3 to 14, delete\u2014\n\n\"The Kurmis are . . . separate caste\" and insert\u2014\n\n\"Next come the Kurmis and Sainthwars, who together number 213,899, or 7\u00b743 per cent of the Hindus. The Kurmis are strongest in the east, but the Sainthwars are found in all tahsils and number 104,057. They were originally a sub-case of the Kurmis, but chiefly because of the rise of their leading family that of the Raja Padrauna, they are now practically a separate caste. They are endogamous and have given up widow remarriages and claim precedence as being of the purest descent; in fact their legends claim for them a descent from Mayur, the founder of the great Bisen clan of Rajputs. The Kurmis also now claim a similar descent.\n\nPage 96 line 20, after \"custom has\" insert \"unfortunately.\"\n\nKOERIS.\n\nPage 96, line 27\u2014\n\nfor 152,283 write 155,911.\nfor 5\u00b773 write 5\u00b742.\n\nPages 96 to 98.

Part of this is doubtless a natural decrease, and part due to emigration; but it seems probable that the greater part of the decline is fictitious and due to faulty returns in 1901, when several members of other communities palmed themselves off as Rajputs. The Rajputs of this district are generally agriculturists by profession, but their skill in cultivation is indifferent. They belong to an endless variety of clans the census, of 1911 showing representatives of 38 different sub-divisions. Not many of these, however, are of much local importance. The foremost place is taken by the Bisens, of whom there are 14,292 distributed...\"\nall over the district, though the largest number is naturally to be found in the Deoria tahsil, in which is situated Majhuali, the headquarters of this ancient clan. The Bais, 7,345, belong mainly to the Bansgaon tahsil. Though they claim connection with the celebrated families of Unao and Rai Bareli, their high rank is not generally admitted and they are in all probability of mixed descent as are the Bais of Fyzabad and the eastern districts as a whole. They style themselves by several names and this seemingly accounts for the great reduction in their number since in 1822 and 1891 there were more than 12,000 persons recorded as of this clan. The Panwars have decreased from 10,912 in 1901 to 2,874 in 1911; they have never attained a position of much prominence; apparently they came to the district in small detachments gaining a footing gradually by marriage with the daughters of the Majhuali house.\n\n\"The Sarnets were not separately enumerated in 1911, but in 1891 they numbered 11,810, chiefly in the Gorakhpur, Hata, and Bansgaon tahsils.\n\n\"They are said to be identical with the Nikumkhs and their history will be given later. Similarly, the Kausiks numbered 7,215 in 1891, residing mainly in Bansgaon and some account of this clan will be found in the article on the Dhuriapar families. There were only 2,180 Surajbansis in 1911 as compared with 6,444 in 1901; the name is often adopted by so-called Rajput immigrants from the hills, while in other cases Surajbansis represent offshoots of the ancient house of Amorha in Basti. The other clans though fairly well represented are of singularly little importance, generally, because their settlement in this district is of recent date, their ancestors coming rather as agricultural colonists than as conquerors. The strongest are the Chaubans, 4,501, who are the only clan showing an increase in the last decade; they are found everywhere, those in the north claiming connection with the Butwal house often calling themselves Chitorias in support of the story that their ancestors fled hither from Chitore on its capture by the Musalmans. Next come the Chandels, 2,963, chiefly in Deoria and Padrauna, the Dikhits, 2,700, from Ghazipur and elsewhere, the Sikarwars, 2,671, and the Amethias 2,344 who reside for the most part in Deoria.\nand came from Amethi south of Bara Banki. Other clans exceeding 1,000 apiece are Sombansis from Partabgarh (1,710), the Raghubansis from Ajodhya (1,517), the Rathors (1,421) who are said to have settled at a very early date in Hata and Gorakhpur, and the Sugars from Ballia (1,350). Among the less numerous local clans of low social status and mixed descent the Donwars or Domwars may be mentioned, as they are sometimes suppose to be the descendants of the old Domkatar rulers of Gorakhpur.\"\n\nPage 99, line 32, page 100, line 1, delete \"Nothing need be said . . . 35,562 persons\" and substitute\u2014\n\n\"Nothing need be said of the Telis, 96,010; Bhars, 76,014; Lunias, 73,377; Kumhars, 63,000; Lohars, 61,584; Dhobis, 53,441, and Pasis, 52,493, while the Mallahs have already been mentioned.\" These castes are common everywhere and their numbers are unusually large only because of the unusual size of the district.

There can be no doubt the former figures were at least in part fictitious, and it is pretty certain that, in spite of the introduction of fees, the number of scholars who attend school, as distinguished from those whose names merely exist on the registers, has steadily increased.

Now however instruction is given up to the B. A. standard; and the college has been housed in a new double-storeyed building and a Science department will be added, as soon as finances permit. There is also a hostel in connection with the college for the convenience of students whose parents do not reside in the city.\n\n\"St. Andrew's Collegiate High School, or the Mission School as it is generally called, is a much older institution, dating back to 1838. It teaches up to the matriculation standard and has a hostel attached. The Jubilee High School was built originally as an Oriental Zilla School in 1875 and was reconstituted in 1887 as a Municipal High School. In 1907 it was handed over to the district board, but in 1910 it was converted into a provincial school under the immediate control of the Department of Public Instruction. Other English institutions in the city comprise two aided high schools, both recently founded, the Gorakhpur High School and the George Middle School, in addition to the C. M. S. Anglo-Vernacular Middle School at Alinagar, in the rest of the district there is only one Government institution, the King Edward High School at Deoria, which has just been housed in a handsome building.\n\n\"There is an aided Middle School at Barhaj, while private schools teaching up to the matriculation standard exist at Lar, Bansgaon, and Dhakwa Bazar. Among other secondary schools the most important is the Government Normal School, which was opened in 1904 in a costly building on which Rs. 1,58,632 were expended, in the magnificent grounds of Mr. Bridgman's bungalow in the Turkmanpur muhalla. It accommodates six teachers and 100 pupil teachers drawn from the Gorakhpur and Benare\ndivision and from Gonda and Bahraich some 46 teachers being passed but annually after a course of two years. Attached to this training school is a large Middle Vernacular School. There are in the district 11 other combined Middle and training schools, kept up by the D.B. situated at Dumri and Minwan in the Sadar tahsil, Bansgaon, Barhalganj, and Gola in the Bansgaon tahsil, Lar, and Majhauli in the Deoria tahsil, Padrauna and Kasia in the Padrauna tahsil, and Mahrajganj and Dhanni in the Mahrajganj tahsil, there being none at all in the Hata tahsil.\n\n\"Other Middle Vernacular Schools include the Swinton Memorial School maintained by the C. M. S., a district board school at Barhaj, and an aided institution at Hardia in the Sadr tahsil. The Vernacular final examination is now held at three centres in the district, the number of candidates appearing for it being about 900, a fact significant of the growth of Vernacular education of a higher order in the district. Among the primary schools 206 are managed and 232 aided by the district and municipal boards; there are also several private primary schools, such as that kept up by the Tamkobi estate, but no exact statistics of these are available. Nor is the study of other Oriental languages neglected no less than 32 Sanskrit pathshalas are aided by the district board, while there are several others which are unaided. There are also several Hindi Mahajani Schools, and elementary schools for the study of Persian, Arabic, and the Quran all kept up by private subscriptions. A technical and industrial school also exists in Gorakhpur, having been founded by Government in August, 1911, when the number of students was 25. At the present time the number is 78, of whom 13 are artizans, 34 juniors, and 29 seniors. Night classes were started in 1912 for both Europeans and Indians employed in arts and trades. Thus it will be seen that, taken as a whole, the district is now well advanced in education; much has been done, though of course much still remains to be done, especially in the case with regard to female education, the girls' schools comprise two Government institutions, 15 under the District Board, 19 aided by the District and Municipal Boards (three of which are maintained by the C. M. S. Zenana Mission) and one unaided\nschool, as compared with a total of 17 some eight years ago. The growing importance of Gorakhpur as an educational centre may be judged from the fact that in 1908 an inspector's circle was created with headquarters at Gorakhpur; an assistant inspector has been here since 1904 and his staff consists of one deputy and six sub-deputy inspectors of schools.\"\n\nPage 169, line 28 to page 170, line 9, delete the whole paragraph \"Real... former\" and substitute\u2014\n\n\"LITERACY.\n\n\"In the last few years there has been a steady increase in the total number of literates in the district. In 1872 it was calculated that barely two persons in a thousand could read and write; by 1881 the proportion had risen to 3\u00b76 per cent. of the males and '08 of the females. Ten years later the figures were respectively 4\u00b74 and 15 per cent., while in 1901 about 5\u00b75 per cent. of the male, and '18 per cent. of the female, population came under this category. In 1911 a stricter literacy test was applied, the term being explained as the ability to write a letter and read the answer to it, instead of merely being able to sign one's signature, hence in 1911 only 5\u00b76 per cent. of the male, and '3 per cent. of the female, population were returned as literate; the corresponding provincial figures were 6\u00b71 per cent. for males and '5 per cent. for females. Comparing distribution of literacy by age-periods in 1901 and 1911 we find that the figures for the early age-period are stationary at 7 per mille for males; the figures for the two intermediate age-periods show slight increases, 56 males and three females per thousand of ages between 10 and 15 being literate and 81 males and five females of ages between 15 and 20; on the other hand, in the adult age-period a decrease of two per thousand is to be found, the present figures being 79 per mille for males and three for females. These figures show clearly that education has been making steady progress and also show to what extent those who had learnt in the past how to read and write had forgotten the art. The spread of education however is not very even; 57 out of every 1,000 Hindu males are literate, the figure for Mahomedans being only 3\u00b71 per mille; on the other hand as\nregards females the corresponding figures are two per Hindus and four for Mahomedans. A large proportion of the Kayasth community is literate but very few Chamars are able to read and write. Instruction is almost invariably given in the Nagri character in preference to the Persian, which is used only in the towns and is for the most part confined to the Musalman element. Of the literate population excluding those who used English, 84\u00b74 per cent. employed the Nagri and 6\u00b71 tho Persian; 8\u00b72 per cent. were acquainted with both, 54 per cent. of whom knew Urdu better than Hindi. The figures for English education do not compare favourably with those for the rest of the province; though considerable improvement has taken place; in 1891 only five males and one female per 10,000 were literate in English; by 1901 the corresponding figures were 19 and two, while in 1911 the figures stood at 25 and two respectively as compared with 49 males and even females per 10,000 for the whole of the United Provinces.\"\n\n**DISPENSARIES.**\n\nPage 171, lines 7 to 10, delete \"The average . . . itself\" and substitute \"The annual attendance at this and the district board dispensaries in 1915 was 384,710, of whom nearly one-fifth were treated in Gorakhpur itself and 13 per cent. in Barhaj.

Government Press, United Provinces,\n1916.\nAlterations and Additions to Part A of the Basti District Gazetteer, bringing it up to date (1912).\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\nPage 13.\u2014FLOOD OF 1910.\n\nThere was a heavy flood in the Rapti and its tributaries in 1910. It extended over the Khalilabad, Bansi and Domariaganj tahsils.\n\nIn the Khalilabad tahsil it spread over an area of 7 miles by 5 miles, covering 74 villages and lasting for 5 days. Everywhere the flood water reached the level of the village sites, and in some places the villages themselves were washed away.\n\nThe exact area affected in Bansi tahsil is not known, but the flood lasted there for eleven days. Ordinarily the depth of the water over the low-lying tracts is 2 feet; in this case it rose to 5 feet. The breadth of the Rapti river (in years of normal rain 462 feet) increased to 1,575 feet. Under the orders of the Collector the tahsili officials organized rescue parties, which secured boats from Uska bazaar and other places and saved the lives of many villagers and animals. Little damage was done to property. The standing crops suffered most.\n\nIn Domariaganj tahsil the loss was not so severe as in the other two tahsils and only slight damage was done to the crops.\n\nPage 28.\u2014CATTLE CENSUS OF 1909.\n\nAccording to the cattle census of 1909 the number of plough animals in the district (including male-buffaloes and excluding young stock) was 5,03,434, giving an average of 2\u00b718 animals per plough.\n\nThe average area under cultivation per plough was 5\u00b783 acres. In that year the district contained 4,99,977 bulls and bullocks, 2,85,998 cows, 3,457 he-buffaloes, 1,04,341 she-buffaloes and 3,88,859 young stock. It will be noticed, on a comparison with the figures of the previous census, that there has been a decrease in all cases except in that of young stock. This is attributed to a\nrise in prices. Without a corresponding rise in the purchasing power of the lower orders and also no doubt to forced sales due to scarcity. The price of an ordinary pair of plough-bullocks, which ranged from Rs. 20 to Rs. 40 when the present Gazetteer was published, has nearly doubled.\n\n**Sheep and Goats.**\n\nThe enumeration of 1909 showed 43,311 sheep and 2,48,881 goats, against 35,852 and 2,41,092 respectively of the census of 1904.\n\nThe price of a sheep is as a rule Rs. 4 per head, and that of a skin a little over Re. 1.\n\n**Other Animals.**\n\nThe census showed a total of 10,150 horses and ponies, 80 mules, 6,985 donkeys and 104 camels. The decrease in the number of horses and ponies is fortuitous.\n\n*Page 32.*\n\nThe mortality from plague, which was 4,044 in 1905, went on gradually decreasing until 1909, when it fell to 5 only. In 1910, 658 persons died of the disease. But in 1911 the mortality suddenly increased to a figure in excess of that of 1905, i.e. 5,477 deaths. It was 4,153 in 1912. Rat mortality proves that the disease still subsists.\n\n**CHAPTER II.**\n\n**Agricultural Statistics of 1320 Fasli.**\n\n*Pages 35 to 39.\u2014Cultivated Area.*\n\nThe area of the district as shown in the latest professional survey is 1,786,888 acres; and as shown in the village papers (i.e. sadar kanungo's milan khasra statement for the year 1320 Fasli) 1,796,625 acres.\n\nThe total cultivation was 1,271,787 acres, or 70\u00b778 per cent. of the total area. A revised table (No. 5) showing statistics of cultivation and irrigation for 1320 Fasli is appended herewith. 10\u00b73 per cent. of the total area is barren waste. 2\u00b77 per cent. is occupied by groves. The balance 16\u00b72 per cent. is culturable waste, against 15\u00b73 in 1906. The areas represented by these percentages were 65,450 acres culturable waste, 1,60,894 old fallow, and 64,156 new fallow.\nDOUBLE CROP AREA.\n\nThe area bearing two crops was 4,33,836 acres, or 34\u00b711 per cent, of the total cultivated area: against 5,08,900 acres, or 39\u00b757 per cent. in 1904. The decrease was uniform all over the district. Possibly it is due to the increasing preference for \"jarhan.\" The proportion of double crop area was greatest in Harraiya tahsil (41\u00b702 per cent. of the cultivated area); and lowest in Domariaganj tahsil (28\u00b736 per cent. only).\n\nPage 55.\u2014FAMINE OF 1907-8.\n\nThe rainfall in 1907 was very deficient, the total mean rainfall for the district from June to September 1907, being 21\u00b715 against 42\u00b725, the normal for the period. The result was an almost entire failure of the rice-crop: especially in the Domariaganj tahsil, and in the portion of the Harraiya tahsil, lying to the north of the Railway line, where the late rice crop is the chief product. The outturn of kharif crops for the whole district was 43 per cent. of the normal.\n\nRelief operations were confined to the above tracts. Two poor-houses were opened; one at Basti on the 15th December 1907, and the other at Domariaganj on the 22nd.\n\nVillage works on the aided system were started in January 1908. A test-work was started on the Basti-Domariaganj road on the 6th February 1908, but it was not found necessary to convert it into a regular famine work till March 1st, 1908. The number of persons in receipt of relief rose to 20,000 by the middle of March 1908.\n\nThe rainfall for the period from January to March 1908 was a little above the normal. Consequently the rabi crop was everywhere in the district except in the Domariaganj tahsil fairly good, the outturn being not less than 86 per cent. of the normal. In the affected tracts, where only half the normal area could be sown, the outturn was proportionately only 7 annas in the rupee. The result was that, after the harvesting of rabi crops had been completed, the number of labourers on the relief works gradually went on increasing until the middle of May 1908. It then reached 44,676: of whom 22,500 with 10,650 dependants were on relief works, 4,300 on aided works, 7,000 in receipt of gratuitous relief and 156 in the poor-houses.\nIn June 1908 the rainfall in some tahsils was above the normal, and everywhere sufficient for sowing purposes; and the prospects of the kharif became satisfactory. Labourers accordingly abandoned the works in order to resume their agricultural operations. The departmental works were replaced by civil works. These in turn were ultimately closed by the 15th July 1908. The number receiving gratuitous relief increased a little in consequence (rising to 25,000), and then began to fall. Gratuitous relief was stopped at the end of August 1908, and the two poor-houses were closed at the end of September 1908.\n\nThe works in all cases (both P. W. D. and C. W.) took the form of tanks. These were not completed, owing to the early and copious rainfall in June and July 1908. So far, however, as they were constructed, they have made excellent reservoirs for the storage of surplus rain water for irrigation and drinking purposes.\n\nThe expenditure incurred by Government through the P. W. D. amounted to over 2 lakhs of rupees. 37 civil works were constructed at a cost of Rs. 1,16,400, and over Rs. 1,07,900 was spent in gratuitous relief.\n\nRupees 72,900 was given as advances to zamindars for village works. All these works took the form of tanks.\n\nIn the kharif kist Rs. 60,955 were suspended and Rs. 68,458 remitted. In the rabi kist the corresponding figures were Rs. 14,210 and Rs. 44,822. Advances under Acts XIX of 1883 and XII of 1884 were made as detailed below:\n\n|                | Rabi     | Kharif   |\n|----------------|----------|----------|\n| For seed       | 2,66,862 | 3,92,858 |\n| For katcha wells | 54,477  | Nil      |\n| For purchase of bullocks | Nil    | 57,900   |\n| For pakka wells | Nil      | 2,95,002 |\n| For repairs to wells | Nil    | 6,816    |\n\nIn addition Rs. 10,000 was advanced to the District Co-operative Bank, Basti, for distribution to cultivators. There was no scarcity of fodder, and no unusual mortality among cattle is believed to have taken place. About 10,000 cattle were sold owing to scarcity.\nPage 58.\n\nThe wages of all classes of labourers have risen considerably. For instance the wages of a carpenter or blacksmith or mason, which ranged from 3 to 4 annas in former years, have now risen to 5 to 7 annas per diem.\n\nPage 67.\n\nThe length of metalled roads has increased from 51 to 98 miles. In addition, over 28 miles of unmetalled roads have been added to the list of District Board roads.\n\nCENSUS OF 1911.\n\nPage 72.\u2014To be added after line 7 in a separate paragraph.\n\nThe census of 1911 showed a total population of 1,830,421 persons: a decrease of 15,732 persons on the census of 1901. The average density works out to $653 \\cdot 2$ per square mile, against $670 \\cdot 9$ in 1901. This decline may be attributed to the famine of 1907-8 and to the havoc caused by successive years of plague. Notwithstanding this decline a density of $653 \\cdot 2$ per square mile in a district with no large towns places Basti high in respect of population among the districts of the United Provinces. Of the tahsils Khalifabad stands first, having a density of 716; and Basti second with 697 per square mile. The rest in order of density are Bansi, Harraiya and Domariaganj, with 678, 660 and 522 respectively.\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nHISTORY OF THE RAJAS.\n\nPage 91.\u2014Line 14 to be added after 'Ratan Sen Singh.'\n\nThe Raja died in 1913, and was succeeded by his son Lal (now Raja) Ratan Sen Singh.\n\nTo be added in line 18 after 'Rs. 1,21,685.'\n\nSince then the State has diminished greatly. At present it comprises 339 villages in Basti district, with an area of 74,757 acres and revenue of Rs. 76,484; and 3 villages in Gorakhpur district, with a revenue of Rs. 795.\n\nPage 92.\u2014Line 26, to be added after 'a few villages in Fyzabad.'\n\nThe estate of Raja Narendra Bahadur Pal at present consists of 70 villages in this district, paying a revenue of Rs. 19,004; and a few villages in Fyzabad. That of Mangal Prasad Pal con-\nsist of 24 villages paying a revenue of Rs. 7,090, all in this district.\n\nPage 94.\u2014Line 15 to be added after 'within twelve years.'\n\nThe debt has since been liquidated.\n\nPage 94.\u2014Line 28, to be added after 'paying a revenue of Rs. 17,287.'\n\nHe has since added to his estate, which now consists of 85 villages paying a revenue of Rs. 20,037.\n\nPage 95.\u2014Line 20 to be added after 'in Basti East.'\n\nBabu Ram Bakhsh Singh has since died. His son, Babu Bishnath Bakhsh Singh, inherited his property, which amounts to 37 villages paying Rs. 5,436 as land revenue.\n\nPage 96.\u2014Line 7 to be added after 'from the Raja of Bansi.'\n\nThe property has since dwindled to three villages only, paying at present (1913) Rs. 535 as land revenue.\n\nPage 96.\u2014Line 12 to be added after 'with a revenue demand of Rs. 19,102.'\n\nAt present the Babus of Rudhauli consist of (1) Bhaiya Badri Pershad Singh owning 154 villages and paying a revenue of Rs. 12,639, (2) Thakur Jailal Singh owning 44 villages and paying Rs. 6,872 as land revenue, (3) Babu Lalta Pershad Singh and Babu Mahadeo Pershad Singh, jointly holding 21 villages and paying a revenue of Rs. 5,915, (4) Babu Sarfraz Singh holding 23 villages and paying a revenue of Rs. 2,709, and (5) Babu Durga Parshad Singh holding 37 villages and paying a revenue of Rs. 2,224.\n\nPage 97.\u2014Line 3, to be inserted after the sentence ending with '1897.'\n\nAfter the death of Pandit Sri Nawaz Pande his estate descended to his heirs (consisting of his sons Nageswar Prasad Pande, Dwarka Prasad Pande, Ram Prasad Pande, Ram Kirpal Pande and Baldeo Prasad Pande). They own 19, 9, 23, 22 and 21 villages respectively: and pay land revenue of Rs. 1,772, 534, 1,932 2,126 and 2,251.\n\nPage 96.\u2014Line 24 to be added after the sentence ending with 'Rs. 12,901.'\n\nOn the death of Ram Harakh Chaudhri, his heirs (1) Mangal Prasad, (2) Raja Ram and (3) Rajeshwari Prasad inherited his\nproperty. They jointly pay Rs. 6,707 as land revenue.\n\nPage 96.\u2014Line 28 to be added after the sentence 'ending with landlords of the district.'\n\nBabus Mathura Prasad and Ram Pratap inherited the property, on the death of Pandit Deokali Prasad. They now hold 33 villages, and pay a revenue of Rs. 6,682.\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nPages 111-112.\n\nFormerly the executive staff of the district consisted of a Magistrate and Collector, 5 Magistrates of the first class, 1 with third class powers, and 5 Tahsildars.\n\nThe present sanctioned scale of the district is (besides the Magistrate and Collector) 6 Magistrates of the first class, 1 Treasury Officer, 1 Assistant Collector, first class, and 5 Tahsildars.\n\nIn addition there are 13 Honorary Magistrates; 6 of whom form a bench at Basti with jurisdiction over the police circles of Basti, Kalwari, Sonhan, Rudhauli, Budhabandh and Captainganj. All the Honorary Magistrates, with the exception of Raja Pateshwari Pratap Narain Singh of Basti, Raja Ratan Sen Singh of Banai, Babu Jai Lal Singh of Rudhauli and Rai Nageshwar Prasad Singh Bahadur of Marwatia (who hold second class powers), are invested with the powers of a third class magistrate.\n\nFormerly cases committed to Sessions used to be tried by the Sessions Judge of Jaunpur, who came to Basti for the purpose every alternate month. Under the Green Scheme the system has now been altered, and Sessions cases are tried either by the Additional Sessions Judge of Gorakhpur sitting at Gorakhpur or by an Additional Sub-Judge and an Assistant Sessions Judge sitting at Basti.\n\nCriminal appeals are heard by the Additional Sessions Judge of Gorakhpur. Original civil suits are tried by the Munsifs of Basti and Bansi, and the Subordinate Judge stationed at Basti. Appeals from the decisions of the Munsifs are heard by the Subordinate Judge, who has been empowered to do so under the Green Scheme. Appeals from his decisions valued at Rs. 5,000 and under are disposed of by the District Judge and Additional District and Sessions Judge of Gorakhpur (and Basti) stationed\nat Gorakhpur. The Subordinate Judge and one of the Munsifs are stationed at Basti, and the other Munsif resides at Bansi.\n\nPage 124.\n\nFormerly there were 26 thanas in the district. Four of them (viz: Chapia, Bankata, Harraiya and Barakoni) were abolished in October 1908, being amalgamated with adjoining stations. At present there are 22 police stations, with one-outpost at Harraiya. This scheme in turn is under revision in connection with the recasting of the Gorakhpur and Basti districts.\n\nPage 138.\n\nThe present Veterinary Staff in the district consists two of Veterinary Assistants on itinerating duty and 1 Veterinary Assistant stationed at the Veterinary Dispensary, Basti. No Veterinary Establishment was entertained in the district previous to the year 1906.\nGazetteer of Basti.\n\nAPPENDIX.\nGAZETTEER OF BASTI.\n\nAPPENDIX.\n\nCONTENTS.\n\n| Table | Description                                                                 | Page |\n|-------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|\n| I     | Population by tahsils, 1901                                                 | i    |\n| II    | Population by thanas distributed by religion                                | ii   |\n| III   | Vital statistics                                                            | iii  |\n| IV    | Deaths according to cause                                                   | iv   |\n| V     | Cultivation and irrigation, 1319 Fasli                                       | v    |\n| VI    | Principal crops by tahsils                                                  | vi-x |\n| VII   | Criminal Justice                                                            | xi   |\n| VIII  | Cognizable crime                                                            | xii  |\n| IX    | Revenue and cesses, 1320 Fasli                                              | xiii |\n| X     | Excise                                                                      | xiv  |\n| XI    | Stamps                                                                      | xv   |\n| XII   | Income-Tax                                                                  | xvi  |\n| XIII  | Income-tax by tahsils                                                       | xvii |\n| XIV   | District Board                                                              | xix  |\n| XV    | Distribution of Police, 1908                                                | xx   |\n| XVI   | Education                                                                   | xxi  |\n| XVII  | List of schools, 1913                                                       | xxii |\n| XVIII | Roads, 1913                                                                 | xxxi |\n| XIX   | List of Ferries, 1913                                                       | xxxii|\n| XX    | Post Offices, 1913                                                          | xli  |\n| XXI   | Markets                                                                     | xlii |\n| XXII  | Fairs                                                                       | xlv  |\n| Tabsil | Total Persons | Males | Females | Hindus | Musalmans | Others |\n|--------|---------------|-------|---------|--------|-----------|--------|\n|        |               |       |         | Males | Females | Males | Females |\n| 1      | 154,386       | 83    | 71      | 113,967| 40,730   | 41,551| 82,831 |\n| Domaringanj | 906,161     | 415,354| 490,807 | 840,080| 76,717   | 75,945| 87,389 |\n| Danai  | 393,915       | 191,906| 202,009 | 385,911| 154,832   | 151,076| 27,972 |\n| Hurraiya | 370,906     | 185,782| 185,124 | 388,877| 106,847   | 102,130| 47,851 |\n| Basli  | 370,906       | 191,906| 180,000 | 385,911| 154,832   | 151,076| 27,972 |\n| Khabilabad | 370,906    | 191,906| 180,000 | 385,911| 154,832   | 151,076| 27,972 |\n| Total I| 1,630,421    | 830,286| 799,135 | 1,525,395| 504,013   | 154,068| 360 |\n\nTable I.\u2014Population by tahsils, 1901.\n### Table II \u2014 Population of the police circles distributed by religion, 1911.\n\n| Serial number and Name of thana | Total | Males | Females | Total | Males | Females | Total | Males | Females | Total | Males | Females |\n|-------------------------------|-------|-------|---------|-------|-------|---------|-------|-------|---------|-------|-------|---------|\n| 1.

Agra and Oudh.\n\nALLAHABAD:\n\nPrinted by the Superintendent, Government Press, United Provinces.\n1916.\nNotes on District Gazetteer, Azamgarh.\n\nPage 9.\nThe area of Narja Tal and Ratoi Tal is incorrectly given. It should be\u2014\"cover some 1,000 and 4,500 acres respectively\".\n\nPage 17.\nThe price of a pair of ordinary bullocks has now risen to about Rs. 60 and that of a team of four of superior breed to Rs. 200. The figures given in lines 13 and 14 of page 17 should be corrected accordingly.\n\nPage 37.\nIn the last line but four of the page the words \"a passing\" should be omitted, and the last sentence should be struck out, substituting the following:\u2014\n\n\"The area under 'san' is now considerable, the average for the years 1319 to 1321 having been 8,355 acres. The greater part of the hemp is now grown for export, and a number of presses worked by manual labour have been set up at Atraith, Koelsa, Rani Sarai and other places, and there is one at Bilaisa close to the Azamgarh Railway Station\".\n\nPage 39.\nThe area under poppy has fallen very greatly and is now about 2,400 to 2,500 acres only.\n\nPage 56.\nThe third sentence under manufactures should read as follows:\u2014\n\n\"Of the remainder, indigo was the most important and at one time occupied a prominent position, but it has now practically disappeared. In 1321 F. the only place where indigo was prepared in any appreciable quantity was on the Kajha Estate.\"\n\nPage 64.\nThe last sentence of the paragraph under trade should be omitted.\n\nPage 66.\nUnder Railways delete the part of the paragraph after the words:\u2014\n\n\"There are altogether 94 miles of Railway in Azamgarh\".\nPage 67.\n\nIn line 14 for the word \"short\" the word \"considerable\" should be substituted, and in lines 17 and 18 for the words \"has since only being\" the words \"was till recently only\" should be substituted. The length of metalled roads should be shown as 217,371 miles and of unmetalled roads as 514,267 miles.\n\nAfter the sentence ending in line 12 should be added: \"From Ambari on this road a branch some ten miles in length has now been opened to Ahraula, the headquarters of the Mahul Tahsil\".\n\nPage 68.\n\nIn line 5 the words \"while sarais\" &c. to the end of the sentence, should be omitted. In line 9 should be added \"Ahraula and Jianpur,\" and in the following line the word \"five\" should be substituted for \"three\".\n\nPage 73.\n\nThe following paragraph may be added regarding the census of 1911:\n\n\"At the census of 1911 it was ascertained that the total population amounted to 1,492,818, the males exceeding females by less than 7,000. The number of Hindus was returned as 1,304,582, as compared with 1,313,372 in 1901, and that of Muhammadans as 186,843, as compared with 214,631 in 1901. The decline in the population of the district was according to these figures mainly due to the remarkable decrease among the Muhammadans and to some extent this was doubtless due to the very great reluctance shown by the weaving community in evacuating their houses in times of plague, and the consequent high mortality suffered by them. The unusually heavy mortality in 1905, 1909 and 1910 should be noticed. In the last named year the deaths exceeded the births by nearly 21,000, the number dying from plague amounting to nearly 22,000 and from cholera to nearly 12,000, the two together forming the severest affliction which has fallen on the district within recent years.\"\n\nPage 74.\n\nAfter \"Maharajganj\" (8th line from bottom of page) should be inserted the following sentence:\n\n\"The census figures of 1911 are very misleading as regards most of these towns, for the enumeration was made at a time\nwhen plague was raging violently and when the towns were to a large extent evacuated.\"\n\nPage 75.\n\nFor the first four words of opening sentence under Sex substitute.\n\n\"At the census of 1901\" and after it the following should be inserted:\n\n\"This difference, as already pointed out, had entirely disappeared by 1911, and there was a small preponderance of males, due probably to the increased liability to plague suffered by women, and particularly by those strictly confined to their homes by reason of the pardah system. The following sentences must be read as applying to the census figures of 1901.\"\n\nPage 98.\n\nFor the last sentence under Language and Literature the following should be substituted:\n\n\"There are no newspapers published in the district and only two small presses, one at Azamgarh known as the Mahtab Press and the other at Kaptanganj: both of these are used solely for the printing of forms and notices.\"\n\nPage 107.\n\nFirst line of third paragraph read \"Raja Muhammad Shah.\"\n\nPage 109.\n\nEnd of 1st para. after the word \"Gorakhpur\" read \"the present Raja who is the son of Babu Khaliq Shah was appointed an Honorary Magistrate for the Azamgarh municipality in 1913.\"\n\nPage 111.\n\nIn 3rd line of the 2nd paragraph read: \"Rani Dhandei Kuar.\"\n\nPage 112.\n\nOmit the first sentence.\n\nIn the second sentence for the words \"is now held by women, it\" substitute:\n\n\"which is now held by his grandson, Mir Mehdi Husain,\" &c.\n\nLower down insert the words \"the late\" before \"Harbans Deo Narain Singh,\" omitting the word \"has\" twice.\n\nIn the last sentence of this paragraph instead of \"last settlement\" read: \"at the sixth settlement.\"\nPage 113.\n\nIn line 13 omit: \"It is likely to be soon redeemed\".\n\nPage 121.\n\nIn 4th line read: \"and six\" instead of \"four\", and omit \"and one with powers of the third class.\"\n\nIn 4th sentence read: \"seven members\".\n\nThe 5th sentence should read as follows:\n\n\"One of the members, Rai Gopi Kishan Sahib, holds office for life and the rest for fixed periods.\"\n\nThe next sentence should read: \"Within the notified areas of Mau and Mubarakpur and in several other smaller towns there are also honorary magistrates invested with third class magisterial powers.\"\n\nIn the next sentence read: \"three\" instead of \"two\" munsifs.\n\nAfter this sentence insert the following:\u2014\"All hold court at Azamgarh, the separate court at Muhammadabad having been abolished in 1914. The jurisdiction of the Azamgarh munsif and additional munsif extends to tahsil Azamgarh\", &c.\n\nIn last sentence of first paragraph read: \"sub-deputy opium agent\" instead of \"assistant opium agent\".\n\nPage 139.\u2014Note.\n\nI have not re-written the paragraph regarding police stations. The changes mentioned therein as about to take place came into effect some years ago, but I think the paragraph may be allowed to stand as it is.\n\nPage 140.\n\nThe last sentence but one of the paragraph under Crime should read: \"The registration of Doms and of certain Bhars and Pasis has been made under the Criminal Tribes Act of 1913. Pasis are not numerous, but much of the petty thefts &c.\"\n\nPage 142.\u2014Note, 1915.\n\nThe local distillery was abolished in 1901, and during the current year the district is being brought entirely under the contract system, with bonded warehouses at Azamgarh and Ghosi. Eighty eight shops have been settled under the new system, the license fees mounting to Rs. 32,949. Still-head duty for 1913-14 amounted to Rs. 42,828-14-6, the rate being Rs. 2-10-0 per gallon.\nPage 147.\n\nAt the present time, in addition to the head office at Azamgarh, there are 28 sub-offices and 27 branch offices in the district, as against 46 offices of all kinds in 1911.\n\nThere are now combined post and telegraph offices at Azamgarh head office, Azamgarh City, Dohrighat, Ghosi, Mau Nath Bhanjan, Mubarakpur, Muhammadabad and Sagri.\n\nUnder the head of municipality read: \"The income of the municipality up to 1914 was raised\" &c. In the following sentences charge \"is\" to \"was.\"\n\nAdd: \"From April 1st 1914 a tax on circumstances and property was introduced to replace octroi, and the tax on professions was merged in this. An additional source of income is obtained from a drain and cess-pool tax of a semi-voluntary nature.\"\n\nPage 148.\n\nIn line 8 of the 2nd para. read: \"Committees of four members.\"\n\nUnder the paragraph on Act XX towns add the following:\n\n\"[Note, 1915. These towns came under the Town Areas Act (No. II of 1914) when that Act came into force. This Act introduces the elective system into small towns, but at the same time provides for more effective management and control as regards sanitary measures.]\"\n\nPage 151.\n\nInsert in line 10 of paragraph under 'Schools':\n\n\"[Note 1915. The Azamgarh National School lost its status as a High School a few years ago and is now known as the George National School. The Mission School has an average attendance of some 350 to 400 scholars. The number of middle vernacular schools has been increased by the opening of additional schools at Mehnajpur, Thekma, Koelsa and Chiriakot and the total number of boys enrolled exceeds 1,829. There are now 118 upper primary and 44 lower primary schools belonging to the district board, and 137 others receiving grants-in-aid, and the number of girls schools is now 43 including 39 sided girls schools.]\"\n\nPage 152.\n\nIn the end of the last sentence of the 2nd paragraph add:\n\n\"and Bibipur in the Sagri tahsil.\"\nAfter the third paragraph add:\n\n\"[Note, 1915. The principal change to be noted is the recent establishment of travelling dispensaries in the district, the number varying between three and four according to the staff available. Each of these is in charge of a sub-assistant-surgeon on peripatetic duty. The primary object of their introduction into this district was to provide quicker treatment of plague cases and readier means for inoculation against that disease. These dispensaries are provided with a small stock of the medicines most commonly required and their usefulness has extended considerably beyond what was originally expected.]\"\n\nIn the last line of this page substitute \"a few\" for \"two\" acres, and omit the last seven words on page 153.\n\nPage 191.\u2014AHRAULA.\n\nIn the last line but one read: \"is connected with Mahul and Ambari by a metalled road, and with Phulpur, Atraulia\" &c.\n\nPage 195.\u2014AZAMGARH.\n\nIn line 10 read: \"North of the civil station.\"\n\nPage 196.\n\n3rd paragraph read: \"five\" instead of \"four\" wards and add: \"a fifth having been formed in 1914 when the boundaries of the municipality were extended to include the civil lines and the road going to the railway station. Of the four original wards that of Ailwal comprises,\" &c.\n\nPage 197.\n\nLine 15 read: \"George National School\" instead of \"National High School.\"\n\nPage 198.\n\nLine 5 omit \"last,\" and add in line 13 after \"VI of 1868\" the following sentences:\n\n\"At the census of 1911, which took place when the town was to a large extent evacuated owing to a severe outbreak of plague, the population was returned as 10,834. This, however, is obviously an unreliable figure, and the normal population may be taken to be about 17,000 or, with the new additions recently made to the municipal area, over 18,000.\"\n\nAdd a note at the end of the paragraph:\n\"In 1914 octroi was abolished and its place was taken by a tax on circumstances and property, the total average income of the municipality being now about Rs. 27,000 per annum.\"\n\nPage 204.\u2014Belha.\n\nLast line but three read: \"Tandwa.\"\n\nPage 235.\n\nLine 11 read:\u2014\n\n\"Once metalled, but for many years reduced to the second class, and now again being remetalled passes through\" &c.\n\nPage 237.\u2014Jianpur.\n\nIn the last line but four insert the following sentences:\u2014\n\n\"This place is the home of the small Mirshikar community, of whom between 30 and 40 have gun licenses and who live on the produce of their shooting and netting. Their personal appearance is against them, but they are as a matter of fact an obedient and orderly tribe who give no cause of trouble to the administration. Under recent restrictions their livelihood has become somewhat precarious, and a few of them have taken to cultivation on a small scale.\"\n\nPage 241.\u2014Koelsa.\n\nIn last line but two, for \"upper primary\" read: \"vernacular middle school with primary sections.\"\n\nPage 243.\u2014Lalganj.\n\nLast line but two insert: \"branch dispensary\" before \"primary school.\"\n\nPage 246.\n\nIn line 4 after \"Didarganj\" insert: \"which is now metalled as far as Ambari.\"\n\nPage 253.\n\nIn line 5. For the last seven words substitute: \"which branches off from the Azamgarh-Jaunpur road near Rani-ki-Sarai.\"\n\nPage 256.\n\nDelete the words after. \"The place is an important Railway Junction\" to the end of the paragraph.\n\nPage 259.\n\nLast line but two of 2nd paragraph substitute: \"just East of\" for \"through.\"\nPage 260.\u2014MUBARAKPUR.\n\nLine 3 after \"unmetalled road,\" insert: \"and also by a metalled road to the Jahanaganj railway station which crosses that from Mau to Azamgarh about three miles south of the town.\"\n\nPage 265.\n\nLast line but three read: \"and was till
