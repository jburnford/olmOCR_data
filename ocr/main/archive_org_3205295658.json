PANCRAS.\n\nYesterday an inquest, which was adjourned from Wednesday, but in which no evidence was then taken, was held before Mr. Baker, at the Boot Inn, Cromer-street, St. Pancras, on view of the body of Ellen Donald, who came by her death through a quarrel with a woman of the name of Martin now in custody. A report was very prevalent that the deceased had been murdered, and a great sensation was created in the neighbourhood in consequence. The body of the deceased presented new marks of very severe blows on the stomach and hips.\n\nMr. John Edward Ladbury, surgeon, said he had examined the body of the deceased. There was a slight bruise on the right eye, on the right side of the body, there were marks of other bruises as well as over the abdomen. On opening the body there were marks of very severe inflammation, connected with the external bruises; he was of opinion that the inflammation had led to her death; the injuries were quite sufficient to account for her death, and no doubt caused it. The deceased was a well made young woman, about 20 years of age, and apparently healthy. The injuries were probably caused by blows or kicks.\n\nLouisa Tomkins, of 18, Sion Terrace, St. Pancras, said that on Sunday the 13th inst., about a quarter before one in the afternoon, she saw the deceased go into No. 11, Sion Terrace, a house of ill-fame. She heard a scuffle inside, and the deceased was pushed out by some one.\u2014Soon after Mary Martin came out, and, advancing behind the deceased, struck her on the neck, and knocked her down; and while she was lying on the ground, kicked her several times with great violence on the lower part of the body. The deceased was very faint, and could hardly get up. The kicks were about the abdomen and hips. They were both rather tipsy. The fall was a very heavy one, and Martin afterwards pulled her violently by the hair.\u2014The deceased was assisted home, but died on Sunday last. Martin appeared in a great passion at the time.\u2014Witness had not seen the deceased from that time till she was dead.\n\nElizabeth Harris, of 9, Sion Terrace said she saw the brutal assault. The deceased fell heavily, and having got up, proceeded a short distance, when her bonnet came off. Martin run after her, caught her by the hair, and kicked her severely a second time. The deceased was first taken to witness's house, when she said\u2014\"My good woman, I am done done for.\"\n\nMargaret Jackson, the landlady of the house, No. 11, Sion-terrace, deposed that on Sunday week she heard the deceased and Mary Martin quarrelling. She did not know the occasion of the quarrel, but she saw Mary Martin throw the bellows at the deceased, but they did not hit her\u2014Martin then jumped up and struck her once or twice. Witness got the deceased out of the house, and does not know what passed afterwards. Martin left her house on Wednesday week, but witness has since caused her to be taken into custody.\n\nLydia Hollis of 11, Sion Terrace, said the deceased on the day in question, was called in by the witness. The deceased had some writing paper in her hand. Maria Murtin asked who the paper was for; the deceased said for George, (the son of the deceased's landlady) Martin, then made a snatch at it, and then they got quarrelling, and using very bad language about the paper, and a gown Martin had lent the deceased who sent it home dirty. Martin then threw the bellows at the deceased. This was the cause of the quarrel; the deceased then left and Mary Martin followed her; witness does not know what happened afterwards.\n\nThe coroner said there could be little doubt that this was a case of manslaughter, and as their time was valuable, and the documents would take some time filling up; and Saturday being a busy day with them, he would adjourn the inquest till Tuesday for them to sign their verdict.\n\nThe foreman said the verdict must be manslaughter, and assented to the proposition of the coroner.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3205295658.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 740, "total-output-tokens": 927, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 3944, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
