Ann O'Loughlin, a girl about twenty years of age, was charged with assaulting and resisting Police-constable Gamble at the same time and place. Mr. Knowles, solicitor, Widnes, defended both prisoners. It appeared from the evidence of Police-constables Gamble and Middleton, the former of whom had his head enveloped in a surgical bandage, that on Saturday night the male prisoner was drunk and disorderly in Anne-street, and the constables went to him and told him to go away. He refused, and was then told that if he did not go he would be locked up. He replied that no \"bobby\" in Widnes could take him. He was taken into custody, and while Gamble was endeavouring to put the handcuffs on him, prisoner beat and kicked him, and tore his trousers. At this juncture the female prisoner came forward, and said to her brother, \"No, Peter, don't go with them; don't go with them.\" After they had proceeded a short distance Gamble received a severe blow on the back of the head, cutting it open, and causing him to lose a great quantity of blood. While the constables were struggling with the male prisoner Police-constable Middleton said he saw the female prisoner throw the stone which struck Gamble. She threw several stones besides that one. Mary Dearden gave corroborative evidence. For the defence James Mathews, a boy; Miles Sweeney, Thomas Bain, Ann Connolly, and Catherine Riley were called, each of whom swore that all the stones were thrown from the far side of the crowd, and not by the female prisoner at all. Mr. Knowles made a pathetic appeal to the bench on behalf of the girl, who, he said, was going to America in the course of a few days, and she was discharged. Her brother was fined 10s. and costs (6s. 6d.), or fourteen days' imprisonment, for being drunk; 20s. and costs (9s. 6d.), or one month's hard labour, for the assault upon the constable; and 10s. and costs (4s. 6d.) and the damage, 2s. 6d., for injuring the constable's trousers, or fourteen days' imprisonment\u2014making two months in all. Mr. Knowles asked the bench to give the prisoner a short time to pay the total amount in, but this was peremptorily refused.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3200801613.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 1062, "total-output-tokens": 640, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 2478, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
