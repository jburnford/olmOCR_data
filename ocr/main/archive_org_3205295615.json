After the lapse of a little time I gave him a small quantity of brandy, and he in a great measure revived; Riddle then took hold of him, and leading him to the roof of the house, insisted upon his descending from the top to the bottom of the chimney, which he did, and he and Riddle then left the place.\u2014Mr. Rawlinson (to Riddle)\u2014What answer have you to make for ill-treating this poor boy in so shameful a manner?\u2014Riddle\u2014The boy is not an apprentice, and he was not sent up the chimney before a quantity of water had been thrown down.\u2014Mr. Rawlinson, after remarking upon the atrocious nature of the offence, ordered Riddle to find bail to answer the charge at the sessions, at the same time expressing a hope that a severe example would be made of him.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3205295615.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 1016, "total-output-tokens": 769, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 2977, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
