Deceased's widow stated that she and her husband were in the Sussex Arms when McCall spoke offensively to her, and her husband resented it, on which McCall struck him, and he fell back. William G. Bailey, an engineer, said he was present, and heard the dispute between Mrs. Cook and McCall, when deceased pushed McCall rather roughly. McCall then pushed his fist in deceased's jaw, saying he did not want to have anything to do with him. Deceased fell back, and his head struck the edge of a seat. A doctor was called, and all that deceased said was to tell his wife to pay him. Dr. Fairland deposed to having made a post mortem examination. There were no external marks of violence beyond a small cut half-an-inch long at the back of the head, apparently caused by falling against a hard substance. Death resulted from the fall, which need not necessarily have been a violent one. He found no marks of a blow with the fist. The jury, in returning a verdict of accidental death, censured McCall and expressed a hope that it would be a warning to him in future. Mr. Greenep appeared for McCall, who, having been admitted to bail, was present, and expressed his regret at what had occurred.\n\nCHARGE AGAINST A POLICE INSPECTOR.\u2014At Croydon, Jeremiah Flynn, Inspector of Metropolitan Police, stationed at South Norwood, was charged by Lillie Alice Violet Eales, of 49, Addison-road, Norwood, aged twelve, with indecently assaulting her. The evidence of the girl went to show that the offence was committed while she was in the police-station giving the inspector some money she had found in the road. Defendant was committed for trial, bail being allowed.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3200810296.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 1338, "total-output-tokens": 477, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 1921, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
