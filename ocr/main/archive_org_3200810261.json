Braxton Hicks, deputy-coroner for the Western Division of Middlesex, held an inquiry at Hillingdon House, near Uxbridge, into the circumstances attending the death of Mr. Henry Richard Cox, aged eighty-seven years, a member of the well-known banking firm of Cox and Co., of Charing-cross, who died on the 23rd inst.\n\nMr. Frederick Cox, of 3, Grosvenor-crescent, S.W., identified the deceased as his uncle, and stated that he resided at Hillingdon House. The witness last saw him alive and well on the 29th inst. Two days later he heard that he had been in an accident, and witness arrived at the house just as he was dying. Joseph Brooks, valet to the deceased, stated that Mr. Cox was in his usual health on Tuesday.\n\nAt a quarter to eight o'clock in the evening the witness left him in his room sitting in an armchair near the fire whilst he went to get the tray ready for dinner. Upon returning, after an absence of five minutes, he found the deceased lying on the mat much burned. The room was full of smoke. The old gentleman always used to steady himself when getting out of his chair by catching hold of the mantelpiece. When witness left him he was dosing.\n\nFrederick Shaw, valet and footman to Sir Charles Cox, who also resided at Hillingdon House, stated that on the evening in question he was opposite the deceased's room when he heard him groaning. Upon entering the apartment, which was full of smoke, he discovered Mr. Cox lying on the fender. He lifted him up and placed him on a rug. He was really lying in the tender with his right side near the fire, and when witness raised him his clothes \"blazed up.\" Having extinguished the flames as quickly as possible, witness called a doctor and other assistance. The deceased was wearing a loose dressing-gown. When he had been lifted up he asked, \"Who's that?\" and upon witness answering \"Frederick,\" the deceased added, \"Thank God.\" Dr. Charles Roberts of Uxbridge, deposed that he had attended the deceased professionally for twenty-four years. He was a hale and hearty man. On Tuesday morning witness visited him, and found that he was suffering from slight indigestion. In the evening, at half-past seven o'clock, his partner saw him, and was sent for after the accident, witness following at a quarter to nine. The deceased was then in a very exhausted condition and only partially conscious. Death ensued at half-past twelve midnight. Upon making a subsequent examination of the body witness found extensive and deep burns on the back of the head, the right side, side of face, nose, neck, shoulder, arm, and the whole of the right side down to the hip. The cause of death was shock to the system following the burns. The coroner having remarked upon the sad nature of the case, the jury returned a verdict of accidental death.\n\nALLEGED SERIOUS ASSAULT.\u2014A SINGULAR CASE.\n\nGeorge White, nineteen, described as a coal trimmer, of 143, Hooper's-road, Custom-house, and Annie Hurley, twenty-six, an unfortunate, of 47, Martindale-road, Canning Town, was brought up on remand, before Mr. Cook, at the West Ham Police-court, charged with being concerned together in violently assaulting a seaman named John Kent at 73, Martindale-road, Canning Town. Mr. Sharman conducted the prosecution, but the injured man was still unable to appear owing to the injuries he had received. Mr. Sharman understood it would be at least four months before the man could attend, if ever, for he was now paralysed and had lost his speech. Inspector Cummings said he saw the man in the hospital on Thursday night, and he was then in a very bad state. The doctor informed him that there was no hope of his recovery. The prisoners were further remanded.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3200810261.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 924, "total-output-tokens": 895, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 3744, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
