Rankin Hutchinson, the vice-consul for Spain. The prosecutor, a retired captain, resided alone at 182, Wardour-street, Oxford-street. On the night of the attack two friends accompanied him home, but left him at the door. Soon after they had gone there was a knock at the door. The prosecutor opened it, and the prisoner forced his way into the house and ran upstairs. The prosecutor, however, succeeded in keeping a second man out. On going upstairs in search of the prisoner the latter attacked him with a coal hammer and beat him about the head in a most brutal manner. Downstairs the prisoner renewed the attack and broke two or three bottles over his head. The prisoner then escaped through a back window, but appeared to have fallen through a skylight and injured his head. When arrested he made serious allegations against the prosecutor and said that the assault was committed in self defence. Mr. Biron said the police, at the instance of the Treasury, had made certain inquiries with regard to the allegations made by the prisoner, and the result was embodied in a report which had been laid before his lordship. Mr. Burnie said that if his lordship should be convinced that there was absolutely no foundation for the statements that circumstance would be a serious aggravation of an already grave offence. That was why he desired his lordship to see the report, but as the statements in the report affected other persons, it would not, of course, be possible to go into them. Mr. Justice Hawkins said he was not quite sure that such an attempt, if it occurred, would not have made as near an approach to a plea of justification as could well be. If the man was simply resisting an attack upon him he had nothing to do but to prove the fact, and he would at once have the sympathy of everyone. Mr. Burnie remarked that the evidence did not go to that extent. It would be hard as against the prisoner to say that the statement was absolutely without foundation, but he was precluded from proving it. The learned judge said he was not trying the prisoner for making false accusations against the prosecutor, but for the offence of inflicting grievous bodily harm. He had pleaded guilty to a cruel and murderous assault, and the sentence would be seven years' penal servitude.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3200810294.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 1108, "total-output-tokens": 545, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 2452, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
