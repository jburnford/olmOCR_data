Nor has it been thought necessary to mark vowels as long in cases where mistakes in pronunciation were not likely to be made.\n\nConsonants\n\nMost Indian languages have different forms for a number of consonants, such as d, t, r, &c., marked in scientific works by the use of dots or italics. As the European ear distinguishes these with difficulty in ordinary pronunciation, it has been considered undesirable to embarrass the reader with them; and only two notes are required. In the first place, the Arabic k, a strong guttural, has been represented by k instead of q, which is often used. Secondly, it should be remarked that aspirated consonants are common; and, in particular, dh and th (except in Burma) never have the sound of th in 'this' or 'thin,' but should be pronounced as in 'woodhouse' and 'boathook.'\nBurmese Words\n\nBurmese and some of the languages on the frontier of China have the following special sounds:\n\n- aw has the vowel-sound in 'law.'\n- \u014d and \u00fc are pronounced as in German.\n- gy is pronounced almost like j in 'jewel.'\n- ky is pronounced almost like ch in 'church.'\n- th is pronounced in some cases as in 'this,' in some cases as in 'thin.'\n- w after a consonant has the force of uw. Thus, ywa and puwe are disyllables, pronounced as if written juwa and puwe.\n\nIt should also be noted that, whereas in Indian words the accent or stress is distributed almost equally on each syllable, in Burmese there is a tendency to throw special stress on the last syllable.\n\nGeneral\n\nThe names of some places\u2014e.g. Calcutta, Bombay, Lucknow, Cawnpore\u2014have obtained a popular fixity of spelling, while special forms have been officially prescribed for others. Names of persons are often spelt and pronounced differently in different parts of India; but the variations have been made as few as possible by assimilating forms almost alike, especially where a particular spelling has been generally adopted in English books.\n\nNotes on Money, Prices, Weights and Measures\n\nAs the currency of India is based upon the rupee, all statements with regard to money throughout the Gazetteer have necessarily been expressed in rupees, nor has it been found possible to add generally a conversion into sterling. Down to about 1873 the gold value of the rupee (containing 165 grains of pure silver) was approximately equal to 2s., or one-tenth of a \u00a3; and for that period it is easy to convert rupees into sterling by striking off the final cipher (Rs. 1,000 = \u00a3100). But after 1873, owing to the depreciation of silver as compared with gold throughout the world, there came a serious and progressive fall in the exchange, until at one time the gold value of the rupee dropped as low as 1s. In order to provide a remedy for the heavy loss caused to the Government of India in respect of its gold payments to be made in England, and also to relieve foreign trade and finance from the inconvenience due to constant and unforeseen fluctuations in exchange, it was resolved in 1893 to close the mints to the free coinage of silver, and thus force up the value of the rupee by restricting the circulation. The intention was to raise\nthe exchange value of the rupee to 1s. 4d., and then introduce a gold standard (though not necessarily a gold currency) at the rate of Rs. 15 = \u00a31. This policy has been completely successful. From 1899 onwards the value of the rupee has been maintained, with insignificant fluctuations, at the proposed rate of 1s. 4d.; and consequently since that date three rupees have been equivalent to two rupees before 1873.\n\nFor the intermediate period, between 1873 and 1899, it is manifestly impossible to adopt any fixed sterling value for a constantly changing rupee. But since 1899, if it is desired to convert rupees into sterling, not only must the final cipher be struck off (as before 1873), but also one-third must be subtracted from the result. Thus Rs. 1,000 = \u00a3100 - $\\frac{1}{3}$ = (about) \u00a367.\n\nAnother matter in connexion with the expression of money statements in terms of rupees requires to be explained. The method of numerical notation in India differs from that which prevails throughout Europe. Large numbers are not punctuated in hundreds of thousands and millions, but in lakhs and crores. A lakh is one hundred thousand (written out as 1,00,000), and a crore is one hundred lakhs or ten millions (written out as 1,00,00,000). Consequently, according to the exchange value of the rupee, a lakh of rupees (Rs. 1,00,000) may be read as the equivalent of \u00a310,000 before 1873, and as the equivalent of (about) \u00a36,667 after 1899; while a crore of rupees (Rs. 1,00,00,000) may similarly be read as the equivalent of \u00a31,00,00,000 before 1873, and as the equivalent of (about) \u00a3666,667 after 1899.\n\nFinally, it should be mentioned that the rupee is divided into 16 annas, a fraction commonly used for many purposes by both natives and Europeans. The anna was formerly reckoned as 1\u00bdd.; it may now be considered as exactly corresponding to 1d. The anna is again subdivided into 12 pies.\n\nThe various systems of weights used in India combine uniformity of scale with immense variations in the weight of units. The scale used generally throughout Northern India, and less commonly in Madras and Bombay, may be thus expressed: one maund = 40 seers; one seer = 16 chittaks or 80 tolas. The actual weight of a seer varies greatly from District to District, and even from village to village; but in the standard system the tola is 180 grains Troy (the exact weight of the rupee), and the seer thus weighs 2\u00b7057 lb., and the maund 82\u00b728 lb. This standard is used in official reports and throughout the Gazetteer.\n\nFor calculating retail prices, the universal custom in India is to express them in terms of seers to the rupee. Thus, when prices change, what varies is not the amount of money to be paid for the\nsame quantity, but the quantity to be obtained for the same amount of money. In other words, prices in India are quantity prices, not money prices. When the figure of quantity goes up, this of course means that the price has gone down, which is at first sight perplexing to an English reader. It may, however, be mentioned that quantity prices are not altogether unknown in England, especially at small shops, where pennyworths of many groceries can be bought. Eggs, likewise, are commonly sold at a varying number for the shilling.\n\nIf it be desired to convert quantity prices from Indian into English denominations without having recourse to money prices (which would often be misleading), the following scale may be adopted\u2014based upon the assumptions that a seer is exactly 2 lb., and that the value of the rupee remains constant at 1s. 4d.: 1 seer per rupee = (about) 3 lb. for 2s.; 2 seers per rupee = (about) 6 lb. for 2s.; and so on.\n\nThe name of the unit for square measurement in India generally is the bigha, which varies greatly in different parts of the country. But areas have always been expressed throughout the Gazetteer either in square miles or in acres.\nJaisalmer State.\u2014The most western and the third in size of the States of R\u0101jput\u0101na, lying between $26^\\circ 4'$ and $28^\\circ 23'$ N. and $69^\\circ 30'$ and $72^\\circ 42'$ E., with an area of 16,062 square miles. It is bounded on the north by Bah\u0101walpur; on the west by Sind; on the south and east by Jodhpur; and on the north-east by Bikaner. The country is almost entirely a sandy waste, forming part of what is known as the Great Indian Desert. In the neighbourhood of Jaisalmer town, and within a circuit of about 40 miles, the soil is very stony, and numerous low rocky ridges and hard undulating plains occur; but with this exception the general aspect is that of an interminable sea of sandhills of all shapes and sizes, some rising to a height of 150 feet. The sandhills in the west are covered with *phog* (*Calligonum*) bushes, and those in the east with tufts of long grass. Shifting sands, locally termed *dhrians*, are common. Nothing can well bear a more desolate appearance. The villages are few and far between, sparsely populated, and consist as a rule of a few circular huts or wigwams collected round a well of brackish water. A small stream called the K\u0101kni rises near the village of Kotri, 17 miles south of the capital, and after flowing first in a northerly and next in a westerly direction, forms a lake called the Bhuj *jhil*; in years of heavy rainfall it deviates from its usual course, and instead of turning to the west continues north for about 12 miles till checked by the recently constructed Daiya dam.\n\nThe surface of the country is to a large extent covered by dunes of blown sand of the transverse type: that is, with their longer axes at right angles to the direction of the prevailing wind. Rocks of Jurassic age, such as sandstones, shales, and limestones, crop out from beneath the sand, and a large area of Nummulitic rock occurs to the north-west of the capital.\n\nThe fauna is not much varied. Wild hog and leopards are occasionally seen; antelopes are found in the east; while the Indian gazelle, the bustard, and several species of sand-grouse are more or less common.\nThe climate is dry and healthy, but the hot season is very prolonged and the heat is intense and trying. The temperature is highest in May and June, when hot winds prevail with much violence, while the coldest period is in January, the thermometer frequently falling below freezing-point. The rainfall is precarious and varies in different parts. The annual fall at the capital since 1883 has averaged between 6 and 7 inches. Statistics for other places in the State are available only since 1895, and they show that the fall is usually a little greater in the east and south, and less as one proceeds west. The year of heaviest rainfall was 1883, when more than 15 inches were registered at Jaisalmer, while in 1899 no rain at all fell at Kh\u0101bha to the south-west and R\u0101mgarh to the north-west.\n\nThe chiefs of Jaisalmer are Rajputs of the J\u0101don clan, and claim descent from the deified hero, Krishna. According to the annals of the State, the tribe became dispersed at the death of Krishna, and many of them, including two of his sons, proceeded northwards beyond the Indus and settled there. One of their descendants, Gaj, is said to have built a fort called Gajni (identified by Tod as the Ghazni of Afgh\u0101nist\u0101n, but believed by Cunningham to be in the vicinity of R\u0101walpindi); but being defeated and killed in a battle with the king of Khor\u0101s\u0101n, his followers were driven southward into the Punjab, where S\u0101liv\u0101han established a new capital, which he called after himself, and which has been identified with Si\u0101lkot. This chief subsequently defeated the Indo-Scythians in a decisive battle near Kahror, within 60 miles of Mult\u0101n. So great was the fame of this victory that the conqueror assumed the title of S\u0101k\u0101ri, or \u2018foe of the S\u0101kas\u2019 (Scythians), and further to commemorate the event established the S\u0101ka era from the date of the battle (A.D. 78), an epoch which is still in general use throughout India. S\u0101liv\u0101han\u2019s grandson, Bh\u0101ti, was a renowned warrior who conquered many of the neighbouring chiefs, and from him the tribe now takes the name of Bh\u0101ti J\u0101dons. Subsequently, the Bh\u0101tis were gradually driven southwards till, crossing the Sutlej, they took refuge in the Indian desert which has since been their home. Here they came into contact with various R\u0101jput clans, such as the B\u016btas and Chunnas (both extinct), the Bar\u0101has (now Musalm\u0101ns), the Lang\u0101has, and the Sodhas and Lodras (both branches of the Param\u0101ras). Their first capital was at Tanot, still in Jaisalmer territory, which was founded about the middle of the eighth century; but being ousted from this, Deor\u0101j, the first chief to assume the title of R\u0101wal, built Deogarh or Deor\u0101war in 853, now called Der\u0101war in Bah\u0101walpur territory, and established himself there. Shortly afterwards, the capital was changed to Lodorva, an immense city with twelve gates taken from the Lodra R\u0101jputs, the ruins of which lie 10 miles west-by-north of Jaisalmer town.\nwas, however, ill adapted for defence, so Jaisal sought for a stronger place and founded the fort and city of Jaisalmer in 1156. He was succeeded by several warlike chiefs who were constantly engaged in raids and battles, but their passion for freebooting proved disastrous. Authentic history begins at the end of the thirteenth and the beginning of the fourteenth centuries, when the Bh\u0101t\u012bs so enraged Al\u0101-ud-d\u012bn that his army captured and sacked the fort and city of Jaisalmer, which for some time remained deserted. Sabal Singh, who began to rule about 1651, was the first of the Bh\u0101t\u012b chiefs who held his dominions as a fief of the Delhi empire. According to the annals of the Kishangarh State, he served in Peshawar and Kandah\u0101r, and received the grant of Jaisalmer through the intercession of his cousin, R\u0101j\u0101 R\u016bp Singh of Kishangarh. Jaisalmer had now arrived at the height of its power: the territory extended north to the Sutlej, comprised the whole of Bah\u0101walpur westward to the Indus, and to the east and south included many districts subsequently annexed by the R\u0101thors and incorporated in M\u0101rw\u0101r and Bikaner. But from this time till the accession of Mah\u0101r\u0101w\u0101l Mulraj in 1762 the fortunes of the State rapidly declined, and most of the outlying districts were lost. Owing, however, to its isolated situation it escaped the ravages of the Mar\u0101th\u0101s, and it was partly for this reason that Jaisalmer was one of the last States in R\u0101jp\u016bt\u0101na to be taken under the protection of the British Government. By the treaty dated December 12, 1818, concluded with Mulraj, the succession was guaranteed to his posterity: the chief was to be protected from serious invasions and dangers to his State, provided he was not the originator of the quarrel, and he was to act in subordinate co-operation with the British Government. Apart from this treaty, the only important events of Mulraj's rule were the cruel atrocities of his minister, Mehta S\u0101lim Singh. According to Tod, this man, a Mah\u0101jan by caste and a Jain by religion, united 'the subtlety of the serpent to the ferocity of the tiger.' He put to death nearly all the relatives of the chief. With commercial men and with the industrious agriculturists or pastoral communities 'he had so long forfeited all claim to credit that his oath was not valued at a single grain of the sand of their own desert dominion'; and finally he drove out the P\u0101liw\u0101l Br\u0101hmans, famous as enterprising cultivators and landholders, who had constructed most of the khar\u012bns or irrigation tanks now to be found in the State, and whose solid well-built villages still stand deserted, marking an era of prosperity to which it will be difficult for the State ever again to attain. S\u0101lim Singh, however, was mortally wounded by a R\u0101jp\u016bt in 1824, and, as there was some fear that the wound might heal, his wife gave him poison. Mulraj, who had died four years before, was succeeded by his grandson Gaj Singh. In 1829 a Bikaner army invaded Jaisalmer to revenge some injuries committed\nby subjects of the latter; but the British Government interfered, and through the arbitration of the Mah\u0101r\u0101na of Udaipur the dispute was settled. In 1844, after the British conquest of Sind, the forts of Sh\u0101hgarh, Garsia, and Ghot\u0101ru, which had formerly belonged to Jaisalmer, were restored; and in 1846 Gaj Singh died. His widow adopted his nephew Ranjit Singh, who ruled till 1864, when he was succeeded by his younger brother, Bairi S\u0101l. On the death of the latter in 1891, his widows adopted Sy\u0101m Singh, son of Th\u0101kur Kush\u0101l Singh of L\u0101thi; and the choice being confirmed by the Government of India, Sy\u0101m Singh succeeded and took the family name of S\u0101liv\u0101han. He was born in 1887, and has been a student at the Mayo College at Ajmer since 1894. The Mah\u0101r\u0101wal of Jaisalmer is entitled to a salute of 15 guns.\n\nAmong places of archaeological interest may be mentioned the village and fort of Birsilpur (in the north-east), said to have been founded in the second century; Tanot, the first desert capital of the Bh\u0101tis, with its fort and temple dating from the eighth century; Lodorva, which has a Jain temple said to be over 1,000 years old; and Sirwa, a village about 24 miles south-by-south-east of Jaisalmer town, which possesses a building with thirty-two pillars said to have been erected in 820.\n\nThe number of towns and villages in the State is 472, and the population at each Census was: (1881) 108,143, (1891) 115,701, and (1901) 73,370. The decrease of over 36 per cent. in the last decade was due to the famine of 1899-1900, and excessive mortality and emigration resulting therefrom. The only town in the State is the capital, Jaisalmer (population, 7,137). The State is divided into sixteen districts or huk\u016bmat\u0101s, the areas of which vary from about 2,220 to 262 square miles; one district has 100 villages, while two others have but one each; and again one district has one person per square mile, while the most densely populated has but fifteen. Indeed, the density per square mile for the whole State is but 4.56. In 1901 Hindus numbered 51,990, or 70 per cent. of the total; Musalm\u0101ns, 18,648, or more than 25 per cent.; Animists, 1,551; and Jains, 1,178. The languages mainly spoken are M\u0101rw\u0101r\u012b and Sind\u012b.\n\nThe most numerous tribe is that of the R\u0101jputs, who number 31,000, or over 42 per cent. of the total, but more than one-third of them are Musalm\u0101ns. Next come the Cham\u0101rs, who number 8,900, Shaikhs 5,600, and Mah\u0101jans 5,200. More than 36 per cent. of the people are engaged in or dependent on agriculture; but they lead a wandering life, migrating regularly to Sind in the cold season, and many are graziers and keep herds of camels, cattle, sheep, and goats.\nThe soil is for the most part light and sandy, and, as the rain sinks in and does not flow off the surface, a small rainfall suffices for the crops. Save in the few places where water can be stored, only rains crops such as bajra, jowar, mung, moth, and til are grown, and the system of cultivation is rude. Camels are largely used for ploughing; the ploughs are light and just scratch the ground; the seed is sown broadcast, and after it has sprouted a few showers at long intervals bring it to maturity. No agricultural statistics are available; but a good deal of cultivation goes on during the rains, and in favourable seasons (which are few and far between) the produce is said to be just sufficient for the immediate wants of the people. Where the soil is harder and the surroundings hilly and rocky, irrigation is carried on to a small extent from kharans or shallow depressions into which the rain-water flows. Wheat and gram are sown in the beds of these tanks, and only very occasionally can the water be conveyed by ducts to land outside. Since 1892 about Rs. 65,000 has been spent in constructing and repairing kharans, and there are now 377 of them. Wells, being on the average 250 feet in depth, cannot be used for irrigation.\n\nThe wealth of the rural population consists almost entirely in their herds of camels, cattle, sheep, and goats, which thrive in spite of the arid nature of the country. The camels are famous for their easy paces, speed, and hardiness; they plough and harrow the ground, bring home the harvests, carry food and water, and are both ridden and driven. Cattle are bred in considerable numbers, and are of a good class; while the sheep and goats, though small, fatten well.\n\nSalt of fair quality is found in several localities, but is manufactured only at K\u0101nod, about 20 miles north-east of the capital. Brine occurs 10 feet below the surface, and is drawn from pits by the weighted pole and bucket. It is then exposed to evaporation in pans, and a small-grained white salt is obtained. The out-turn is limited by the agreement of 1879 with the British Government to 15,000 maunds a year, entirely for local consumption and use. There are several quarries of limestone near the capital; the stone produced is very fine, even-grained, and compact, of a buff or light-brown colour, and admirably adapted for carving. It takes a fair polish, and was at one time used for lithographic blocks. Another variety of yellow limestone is found at the village of H\u0101bur, 28 miles north-west of the capital; large quantities of an iron ore resembling red ochre are blended with it. Sandstone quarries are worked at Bhad\u0101sar, 17 miles north-west of Jaisalmer town, and fuller's earth and other clays exist in several places.\nThe manufactures are confined to blankets of sheep's wool, small bags and druggets of goats' and camels' hair, and stone cups and platters. The chief exports are wool, gh\u012b, camels, cattle, sheep, and fuller's earth; and the chief imports are grain, cotton, piece-goods, and tobacco. The trade is mostly with Sind.\n\nNo railways traverse the State, the nearest station being Barmer on the Jodhpur-Bikaner Railway, some 90 miles south of Jaisalmer town; and, with the exception of about 6 miles of metalled road in and near the capital, the communications are mere sandy tracks, sometimes marked by milestones. There is but one post office in the State, the mails being carried by runners to and from Barmer, which also possesses the nearest telegraph office.\n\nThe State is visited by constant scarcities, caused by short rainfall or damage done by locusts; indeed hardly a year passes in which a failure of crops does not occur in some part of Jaisalmer. Yet the people suffer less than one would expect, as emigration is an annual event. Practically the only harvest is that sown during the rains; and as soon as it is gathered in September or October, large numbers leave every year to find employment in Sind and Bah\u0101walpur. The people are, by nature and of necessity, self-reliant; they are indifferent, if not averse, to assistance from the State coffers, and many of them consider it so derogatory to be seen earning wages on relief works in their own country that they prefer migration. The Darb\u0101r, though its revenue is small, has during recent years done what it could to relieve distress and provide tanks for the storage of water; but a scanty rainfall means not only no crops or indifferent ones, but also difficulty in finding water for man and beast, as well as grass and fodder. The result is that, on the first approach of scarcity, the people leave in larger numbers than usual with their flocks and herds for Sind. Emigration, consequently, has always been, and must continue to be, the main form of relief. No detailed accounts are available of the famines or scarcities prior to 1891-2. In that year, and again in 1895-7 and 1901-2, scarcities affected from one-half to the whole of the State. Relief works were started, but generally failed to attract labour, and a certain amount of gratuitous relief was given. The direct expenditure varied from Rs. 4,000 in 1891-2 to Rs. 40,000 in 1895-7; and as, under the land revenue system, the Darb\u0101r takes a share of the produce, its losses under this head were considerable. The famine of 1889-1900 was a severe one. The rainfall was less than an inch and the whole State was affected. About 50,000 people emigrated to Sind and Bah\u0101walpur, taking with them 12 per cent. of the horned cattle and\n20 per cent. of the camels. Assuming that half of these animals were brought back, the State lost about 148,000 cattle and over 7,400 camels. Relief works and poorhouses were open for twelve months, and more than 410,000 units were relieved. The total expenditure was about Rs. 52,000.\n\nDuring the minority of Mah\u0101r\u0101wal S\u0101liv\u0101han the administration is being conducted by a Diw\u0101n and Council of four members, under the general superintendence of the Resident, Western R\u0101jput\u0101na States. In each of the sixteen huk\u016bmats there is a h\u0101kim. The lowest courts are those of the h\u0101kims; fourteen of them can punish with imprisonment up to fifteen days and fine not exceeding Rs. 50, while the remaining two, and also the city kotv\u0101l, can pass a sentence of one month\u2019s imprisonment. All these officers have certain civil powers. But most petty civil suits are decided by a panch\u0101yat of three or more members appointed by the parties concerned, the award being final; or if the parties cannot agree, by a body known as a sult\u0101ni panch\u0101yat appointed by the h\u0101kim or kotv\u0101l as the case may be. The Sadr Criminal Court, besides hearing appeals against the orders of the lower courts, tries cases beyond their powers, and can sentence to imprisonment up to one year and fine up to Rs. 300. The Sadr Civil Court also hears appeals against the orders of the lower courts (including the awards of sult\u0101ni panch\u0101yats), and tries suits beyond their powers. Decrees for sums exceeding Rs. 5,000 are subject to the confirmation of the Resident. Here again many of the suits are decided by arbitrators chosen by the parties. The Diw\u0101n hears appeals against the orders of the Sadr Criminal and Civil Courts, and tries such original cases as are beyond the powers of the former. He can sentence up to two years\u2019 imprisonment and Rs. 500 fine; sentences exceeding these limits, and all sentences in cases of homicide and dacoity, are subject to the confirmation of the Resident. The court of the Resident is the highest in the State; besides dealing with such cases as require its confirmation, it can call for the proceedings in any case and revise the orders passed.\n\nThe normal revenue of the State is nearly one lakh, the chief sources being customs, about Rs. 48,000; and land, about Rs. 16,000. The ordinary expenditure may be put at about Rs. 88,000, the main items being: cost of administrative staff (civil and judicial), Rs. 26,000; army and police, Rs. 18,000; palace expenditure (including the Mah\u0101r\u0101wal\u2019s education), Rs. 12,000; and stables (including elephants, camels, &c.), about Rs. 10,000. The famines and scarcities which have been so frequent during the past decade have not only reduced the revenue, but have necessitated much extraordinary expenditure,\nwith the result that at the present time the State owes about 2 lakhs to the British Government.\n\nJaisalmer has its own coinage, called Akhai shahi after Mah\u0101r\u0101wal Akhai Singh, who established a mint at the capital in 1756. The local rupee in 1895 was worth more than 15 British annas, but now exchanges for about 11; its value fluctuates almost daily, and has been as low as 9 annas. The mint has not been worked since 1899, and the Akhai shahi coins will be converted as soon as possible.\n\nThe land revenue system has undergone no changes for a long period, and neither a survey nor any regular settlement has been undertaken. The revenue is mostly paid in kind. Where wheat or gram is grown, the State takes from one-fifth to one-sixth of the produce; and of the rains crops from one-fifth to one-eleventh. There are four different modes of estimating the State share of the out-turn. In the first, the crop is valued when standing; in the second, when cut, but before threshing; in the third, after it has been threshed out; and in the fourth, from the condition of the bare standing stalks. In addition to the portion payable to the State, the cultivator has to settle the demands of the men told off to watch the crops in the Darb\u0101r's interests and of certain other officials; these demands collectively amount to about half of what is taken by the State. In places, the land revenue is paid in cash at Rs. 2 (local currency) for as much land as can be cultivated with a pair of bullocks. Of the 471 villages in Jaisalmer, 239 are khalsa, or pay revenue direct to the State, 88 are held by jagird\u0101rs, 24 as charitable grants, 11 under title-deeds, 99 in bh\u016bm, and 10 for services to the State. Only one of the jagird\u0101rs pays tribute; but all serve the Darb\u0101r when called on, pay meota or fee on succession, and present the chief with a horse on certain occasions. Lands given in charity (s\u0101san) enjoy complete immunity from all State dues and are practically grants in perpetuity. Those who hold under title-deeds (fatta) or for service rendered to the State pay nothing, but retain their estates at the pleasure of the Darb\u0101r; while the bh\u016bmi\u0101s have to serve when called on, and pay a fixed sum yearly, as well as certain sums on such occasions as the chief's accession, marriage, &c.\n\nThe State troops number 220 of all arms: namely, 39 cavalry, 168 infantry, and 13 artillerymen. Out of 25 guns, 17 are serviceable. The annual expenditure on the army is about Rs. 10,000. The police force numbers 152 men, of whom 72 are mounted, chiefly on camels, and the annual cost is about Rs. 9,000. There is one jail (at the capital), and small lock-ups in the districts.\n\nIn regard to the literacy of its population Jaisalmer stands tenth among the twenty States and chiefships of R\u0101jput\u0101na, with 2\u00b79 per cent. (5\u00b74 males and 0\u00b71 females) able to read and write. Excluding indigenous schools managed by Jatis (Jain priests), the State now contains\nthree schools. In 1901 the vernacular alone was taught, the attendance was 69, and the expenditure about Rs. 600. In 1903 English classes were started at the capital, and the attendance at the three institutions has now risen to 183 and the expenditure to about Rs. 1,100. No fees are charged.\n\nThe State possesses a small hospital and a lunatic asylum, both at the capital, which cost about Rs. 3,000 a year. A staff of vaccinators is employed, who in 1904-5 successfully vaccinated 1,104 persons, or 15 per 1,000 of the total population.\n\n[C. K. M. Walter, *Gazetteer of Jaisalmer* (1877); *Rajputana Gazetteer*, vol. ii (1879, under revision): *Report on Famine-Relief Operations during 1896-7*; A. Adams, *The Western Rajputana States* (1899).]\n\n**Jaisalmer Town.**\u2014Capital of the State of the same name in Rajputana, situated in 26\u00b0 55' N. and 70\u00b0 55' E., about 90 miles north of the Jodhpur-Bikaner Railway at Barmer, and approximately 1,200 miles north-west of Calcutta, and 600 north of Bombay. Population (1901), 7,137. The town was built by and named after R\u0101wal Jaisal in 1156. It stands at the south end of a low range of hills, and is surrounded by a substantially built stone wall, 3 miles in circuit, 10 to 15 feet high, 5 feet thick, and strengthened by bastions and corner towers. The two main entrances, one on the west and the other on the east, are connected by a metalled and paved road, fairly wide in most parts, which is the principal thoroughfare; the other streets are chiefly narrow passages\u2014narrowest where some of the finest houses stand, as the well-to-do were able to encroach when rebuilding or improving their residences. A large portion of the space within the walls is unoccupied, but the ruins lying about prove that the place must have been far more populous in former times. To the south, on a hill overlooking the town, stands the fort. This hill is about 250 feet above the surrounding country, and 500 yards long by 250 wide at its greatest diameter. It is entirely covered with buildings and defences: and the base is surrounded by a buttress wall of solid blocks of stone about 15 feet high, above which the hill projects and supports the ramparts, forming a double line of defence. The bastions are in the form of half towers, surmounted by high turrets and joined by short thick walls; these again support battlements which form a complete chain of defence about 30 feet above the hill. The fort is approached by one entrance on the town side, which has four gates. Within the fort is the Mah\u0101r\u0101wal's palace, an imposing pile crowned by a huge umbrella of metal mounted on a stone shaft, a solid emblem of dignity of which the Bh\u0101ti chiefs are justly proud; but the interior is ill-arranged and space is frittered away in numberless small apartments. The houses are all substantially built of stone and mortar and flat-roofed. Most of them have beautifully carved fronts of the\nyellow limestone found locally, which is easily chiselled when first quarried, and becomes harder on exposure. The Jain temples in the fort are very fine, the carving in them being exquisite; some of them are said to be 1,400 years old. The town possesses a post office, a jail with accommodation for 88 prisoners (the daily average strength in 1904 being 54), an Anglo-vernacular school and a primary Hindi school attended by 160 boys, and a hospital with accommodation for 6 in-patients.\n\nJai Samand.\u2014Lake in Udaipur State, Rajputana. See Dhebar Lake.\n\nJaito.\u2014Town in the Phul nizamat of Nabha State, Punjab, situated in 30\u00b0 26' N. and 74\u00b0 56' E., on the Ferozepore-Bhatinda branch of the North-Western Railway, 40 miles east of Ferozepore. Population (1901), 6,815. Jaito possesses a large grain market, and an important cattle fair is held here in the month of February. It has a police station, a dispensary, and a primary school.\n\nJajmau.\u2014Former name of the Cawnpore tahsil, Cawnpore District, United Provinces.\n\nJajpur Subdivision.\u2014North-western subdivision of Cuttack District, Bengal, lying between 20\u00b0 39' and 21\u00b0 10' N. and 85\u00b0 42' and 86\u00b0 37' E., with an area of 1,115 square miles. The population in 1901 was 560,402, compared with 525,910 in 1891. The west of the subdivision lies on the fringe of the Chota Nagpur plateau, and this portion is very sparsely populated; towards the east, which consists of a fertile highly cultivated plain, the density increases, the average for the whole subdivision being 503 persons per square mile. It contains one town, Jajpur (population, 12,111), its head-quarters; and 1,580 villages.\n\nJajpur Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the subdivision of the same name in Cuttack District, Bengal, situated in 20\u00b0 51' N. and 86\u00b0 20' E., on the right bank of the Baitarani river. Population (1901), 12,111. Under the early kings of the Kesari dynasty Jajpur was the capital of Orissa, and in the sixteenth century it was the scene of the struggle between the Musalmans and Hindus, from which it emerged in ruins. It is still a resort for pilgrims, but has comparatively little trade. It contains many interesting buildings, among which the most striking are the temples of Biroda Devi, of the Boar incarnation of Vishnu, and the great sun pillar that stands a mile outside the town. This latter consists of a huge and beautifully proportioned column of stone raised on a solid pedestal; and if the temple was in proportion, it must have been of a remarkable size. All traces of it have, however, disappeared, and the column has escaped only owing to its great weight, which prevented its would-be destroyers from moving it. Besides these, some ancient heroic figures of gods and goddesses are standing or lying in the compound of the subdivisional office. They are considered to be fine\nspecimens of Hindu art, but all bear traces of Muhammadan vandalism in their mutilated features, from which the noses were cut by the renegade K\u0101la P\u0101h\u0101r. Interesting, too, are the grim features of the seven 'mothers of the earth' in a dark little gallery by the river bank, but there is little beauty in any of these early works. The Muhammadan mosque built by Naw\u0101b Abu Nasir in the seventeenth century is an elegant building, which has lately been restored by the Public Works department. J\u0101ipur was constituted a municipality in 1869. The income during the decade ending 1901\u20132 averaged Rs. 5,800, and the expenditure Rs. 5,300. In 1903\u20134 the income was Rs. 7,600, mainly from a tax on persons (or property tax); and the expenditure was Rs. 6,700. The town contains the usual public offices; the sub-jail has accommodation for twelve prisoners.\n\nJ\u0101ipur.\u2014District and head-quarters thereof in Udaipur State, R\u0101jput\u0101na. See JAH\u0100ZPUR.\n\nJak\u0101sna.\u2014Petty State in Mah\u012b K\u0101nth\u0101, Bombay.\n\nJ\u0101khau.\u2014Petty State in K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r, Bombay.\n\nJ\u0101khau.\u2014Seaport in the State of Cutch, Bombay, situated in 23\u00b0 14' N. and 68\u00b0 45' E., on the south-west coast, 60 miles south-west of Bh\u016bj. Population (1901), 5,059. The town stands between 3 and 4 miles inland, in a plain bare of trees but yielding abundant crops. The landing-place is at Godia creek, 5 miles from the sea, dry at low water, but with a depth of from 8 to 12 feet at high tide. At springs, boats of from 20 to 25 tons burden can pass up. There is a stretch of backwater from the Indus to the Godia creek, known as Bagda, navigable by craft of 8 and 10 tons all the year round. Jakhau carries on a large trade with Bombay, exporting grain and importing piece-goods, groceries, timber, sugar, oil, and dates. The municipal income in 1903\u20134 was Rs. 800.\n\nJal\u0101l\u0101b\u0101d District.\u2014A large district in Afgh\u0101nist\u0101n. It was formerly a province, and contains the tracts known as K\u0101frist\u0101n, Kunar, Laghm\u0101n, Tagao, Ningrah\u0101r, Safed Koh, and Jal\u0101l\u0101b\u0101d. The head-quarters are at Jal\u0101l\u0101b\u0101d Town. The district is bounded on the north by Badakhsh\u0101n; on the east by Chitr\u0101l and territory within the sphere of British influence; on the south by Afridi Tir\u0101h; and on the west by the K\u0101bul province. The whole country is intersected by vast mountain ranges, which include the eastern extremity of the Hindu Kush with its numerous spurs and branches. The Safed Koh forms its southern boundary, separating the Jal\u0101l\u0101b\u0101d valley from Afridi Tir\u0101h. From its highest point, Sik\u0101ram (15,600 feet), this range falls gently to the west and gradually subsides in long spurs, reaching to within a few miles of K\u0101bul and barring the road from K\u0101bul to Ghazni. The district is drained by the K\u0101bul basin, which receives, besides numerous other streams, the waters of the Panjsh\u012br, Tagao,\nAlishang, Aling\u0101r, and Kunar. The valleys of the first three lead into K\u0101firist\u0101n; and the Kunar affords a means of communication with Chitr\u0101l, Badakhsh\u0101n, and the P\u0101mir.\n\nThe district is inhabited by various races. The principal Afghan tribes are the Shinw\u0101ris, Khugianis, Mohmands, and Ghilzais. Tajiks are fairly numerous, and there are small communities of Arabs and Hindus. Kunar contains people of the same race as the Chitr\u0101lis; in Tagao and Laghm\u0101n S\u0101f\u012bs are found in considerable numbers, especially in the former valley. The S\u0101f\u012bs speak a language of Indo-Aryan origin, resembling that of the inhabitants of K\u0101firist\u0101n. There can be little doubt that the S\u0101f\u012bs were originally K\u0101firs, who have been converted to Isl\u0101m during the last few centuries. Ningrah\u0101r, or Nangrah\u0101r, the old name of the Jal\u0101l\u0101b\u0101d valley, is now applied to the southern portion. Bellew (Races of Afghanistan) writes that it is supposed by some to signify \u2018the nine rivers,\u2019 though the valley does not contain so many, and is explained to be a combination of the Persian nuh, \u2018nine,\u2019 and the Arabic nahar, \u2018river.\u2019 It is, however, as he points out, a word of much more ancient date and purely of Sanskrit derivation\u2014nava vih\u0101ra, \u2018the nine monasteries,\u2019 the valley having been a flourishing seat of Buddhism so late as the fifth century.\n\nThe climate of the plains of Jal\u0101l\u0101b\u0101d bears a general resemblance to that of Pesh\u0101war. For two months in the hot season the heat is excessive. Rain usually falls in the months of December, January, and February; snow rarely, if ever, on the plains east of Gandamak. During the winter, from November to May, the wind blows steadily from the west, often bringing violent dust-storms. The wide stony waste of Batikot is dreaded for a pestilential simoom which blows over it in the hot season.\n\nFrom an archaeological point of view few tracts are more interesting than Jal\u0101l\u0101b\u0101d. Although it has been occupied by Muhammadans for a thousand years, there still remain abundant traces of an ancient Hindu population. The localities where these remains are found in great profusion are at Darunta, at the meeting of the Si\u0101h Koh range with the K\u0101bul river; in the plain east of Jal\u0101l\u0101b\u0101d town; and in the vicinity of the small village of Hadda, about six miles south of Jal\u0101l\u0101b\u0101d. Three kinds of buildings are met with: namely, topes, tumuli, and caves, all undoubtedly Buddhist. In some of the topes ancient gold coins of the Eastern Roman Empire\u2014solidi of Theodosius, Marcian, and Leo\u2014have been discovered. Sassanian and old Hindu coins have also been found there, but no Graeco-Bactrian.\n\nJal\u0101l\u0101b\u0101d Town (1).\u2014The only town in the Jal\u0101l\u0101b\u0101d district of Afgh\u0101nist\u0101n, situated in $34^\\circ 26'N.$ and $70^\\circ 27'E.$, 79 miles from Pesh\u0101war, and 101 from K\u0101bul; 1,950 feet above the sea. The town,\nwhich was at one time the favourite winter residence of the Amirs, is an irregular quadrilateral, surrounded by walls extending for 2,100 yards. It is a squalid place, presenting few features of interest. It is divided into four irregular parts by streets which, starting from the various gates, meet in the centre. The permanent population is about 2,000; but this number increases tenfold in the winter, when the tribes from the neighbouring hills flock into it on account of its warmer climate. It is advantageously situated for trade, being on the main route between Peshawar and Kabul, while roads lead from it to Ghazni, and, through Laghm\u0101n, to Badakhsh\u0101n and Y\u0101rkand. The trade consists chiefly in the export of fruit and timber to Peshawar. Two hundred yards from the west gate of the city is a palace belonging to the Amir, but now rarely occupied by him. It is a striking building, constructed about 1892, in a garden 200 yards square, surrounded by high walls. The palace measures about 135 by 144 feet, has large underground rooms for use in the hot season, and a wide veranda all round, from which a charming view is obtained of the valley and adjacent hills. The climate of Jalalabad is similar to that of Peshawar; the heat for two months in the summer is excessive, and the autumn is the unhealthy season.\n\nJalalabad was founded in 1570 by the emperor Akbar. The modern history of the town dates from 1834, when it was seized and sacked by Amir Dost Muhammad. It was occupied by the British during the Afgh\u0101n War of 1839\u201343, when Sir Robert Sale held it, in the face of extraordinary difficulties, against the Afgh\u0101n leader, Muhammad Akbar Kh\u0101n, from November, 1841, to April, 1842. The British forces had practically no stock of provisions, and the small garrison had to make constant sallies. Hardly had the town been made defensible, in February, 1842, when an earthquake rendered the previous work ineffectual. The \u2018illustrious garrison,\u2019 however, held out, and in April an attack was made on the enemy which had the effect of raising the siege. A week later General Pollock\u2019s force gave permanent relief. Jalalabad was again occupied by British troops during the Afgh\u0101n War of 1879\u201380. The British built a fort, called Fort Sale, about a mile east of the town. In this were hospitals and quarters, and these buildings, which are still kept in repair, are now occupied by Afghan troops.\n\nJalalabad Tahsil.\u2014South-western tahsil of Sh\u0101hjah\u0101npur District, United Provinces, conterminous with the pargana of the same name, lying between 27\u00b0 35' and 27\u00b0 53' N. and 79\u00b0 20' and 79\u00b0 44' E., with an area of 324 square miles. Population increased from 158,798 in 1891 to 175,674 in 1901, the rate of increase being the highest in the District. There are 360 villages and one town, Jalalabad (population, 7,017), the tahsil head-quarters. The demand for land revenue in\n1903-4 was Rs. 2,17,000, and for cesses Rs. 35,000. The density of population, 542 persons per square mile, is about the District average. Along the south-western border flows the Ganges, and the R\u0101mgang\u0101 crosses the centre of the tahsil. The Ganges kh\u0101dar is very poor. Beyond the kh\u0101dar a hard clay plain, called bankati, extends up to the R\u0101mganga alluvial tract. The bankati area requires constant irrigation, which is supplied by damming numerous small streams. Near the R\u0101mgang\u0101 the soil is usually richer, but deposits of sand are occasionally left by the river floods. East of the R\u0101mgang\u0101 lies a small tract of light sandy soil, requiring irrigation. In 1903-4 the area under cultivation was 225 square miles, of which 65 were irrigated. Rivers supply more than half the irrigated area.\n\nJal\u0101l\u0101b\u0101d Town (2).\u2014Head-quarters of the tahsil of the same name in Sh\u0101hjah\u0101npur District, United Provinces, situated in 27\u00b0 43' N. and 79\u00b0 40' E., at the junction of the roads from Bareilly and Sh\u0101hjah\u0101npur to Farrukhab\u0101d. Population (1901), 7,017. Jal\u0101l\u0101b\u0101d is an old Path\u0101n town, said to have been founded by Jal\u0101l-ud-d\u012bn Firoz Sh\u0101h. Its importance has decreased owing to its distance from the railway. The houses are chiefly built of mud, and none of the mosques and temples is of special interest. The Government offices stand on the site of an old fort, and the town also contains a dispensary and a branch of the American Methodist Mission. The town is administered under Act XX of 1856, with an income of about Rs. 2,500. Trade is only local. The tahsil school has about 211 pupils.\n\nJal\u0101l\u0101b\u0101d Town (3).\u2014Town in the Kair\u0101na tahsil of Muzaffarnagar District, United Provinces, situated in 29\u00b0 37' N. and 77\u00b0 27' E., 21 miles from Muzaffarnagar town. Population (1901), 6,822. It is said to have been founded by a Path\u0101n named Jal\u0101l Kh\u0101n in the reign of Aurangzeb. A mile away lie the ruins of the celebrated fort Ghausgarh, built by the Rohilla leader, Naj\u012bb Kh\u0101n, with a beautiful mosque which was built by his son, Z\u0101bita Kh\u0101n. Jal\u0101l\u0101b\u0101d was often sacked by the Mar\u0101th\u0101s during the rule of Z\u0101bita Kh\u0101n, and a Mar\u0101th\u0101 still holds a small grant close by. During the Mutiny the Path\u0101ns of this place remained quiet, and one of their leaders did good service as tahsild\u0101r of Thana Bhawan after its capture. The town is administered under Act XX of 1856, with an income of about Rs. 2,300. There are two schools, with more than 100 pupils.\n\nJal\u0101li. Town in the District and tahsil of Aligarh, United Provinces, situated in 27\u00b0 52' N. and 78\u00b0 16' E., 11 miles south-east of Aligarh town. Population (1901), 8,830. The chief inhabitants are the Saiyids, Shi'ahs by sect. They are descendants of one Kam\u0101l-ud-d\u012bn, who settled here about A.D. 1295. This Saiyid family subsequently expelled the old Path\u0101n landholders, and obtained full proprietary rights in the town, which they still possess. The family has supplied\nmany useful subordinate officers to the British Government. The town contains a considerable number of im\u0101mb\u0101ras, one of which is a handsome building. Jal\u0101l\u012b is administered under Act XX of 1856, with an income of about Rs. 1,700. There is a primary school with 60 pupils, and the Muhammadans maintain several schools for reading the Kor\u0101n. The place has little trade.\n\nJal\u0101lpur T\u0101luka.\u2014Central t\u0101luka of Surat District, Bombay, lying between 20\u00b0 45' and 21\u00b0 0' N. and 72\u00b0 47' and 73\u00b0 8' E., with an area of 188 square miles. The population in 1901 was 81,182, compared with 78,649 in 1891, the average density being 432 persons per square mile. The t\u0101luka contains 91 villages, Jal\u0101lpur being the head-quarters. Land revenue and cesses in 1903\u20134 amounted to over 3.6 lakhs. Jal\u0101lpur is a level plain of deep alluvial soil, sloping towards the sea, where it ends in a salt marsh. Along the coast-line low sandhills appear at intervals. With the exception of the salt lands near the coast, the country is rich, highly cultivated, and well supplied with water, groves of fruit trees, and valuable timber. The villages are large and prosperous. Besides the tract on the coast, there are extensive salt marshes along the banks of the P\u016brna and Ambika rivers. The reclaimed land has been made to yield a small return of rice. Jow\u0101r, b\u0101jra, and rice are the staple crops. Miscellaneous crops are pulses, gram, oilseeds, sugar-cane, and plantains. The climate is mild and healthy throughout the year.\n\nJal\u0101lpur Town (1).\u2014Town in the District and tahsil of Gujr\u0101t, Punjab, situated in 32\u00b0 38' N. and 74\u00b0 12' E., 8 miles north-east of Gujr\u0101t town. Population (1901), 10,640. Lying at the junction of the roads connecting Si\u0101lkot, Jhelum, Jammu, and Gujr\u0101t, it is a mart of some importance; but its only local industry is the manufacture of shawls, carried on by a colony of Kashmiris who settled here after the famine of 1833. The municipality was created in 1867. The income during the ten years ending 1902\u20133 averaged Rs. 9,300, and the expenditure Rs. 8,900. In 1903\u20134 the income was Rs. 8,900, chiefly derived from octroi; and the expenditure was Rs. 10,700. The town possesses two Anglo-vernacular middle schools, and two dispensaries, one maintained by Government and the other by the Scottish Mission.\n\nJal\u0101lpur Village (2).\u2014Ancient site in the Pind D\u0101dan Kh\u0101n tahsil of Jhelum District, Punjab, situated in 32\u00b0 39' N. and 73\u00b0 28' E., on the right bank of the Jhelum river. Population (1901), 3,161. The village was identified by Sir Alexander Cunningham with the site of the ancient Bucephala, built by Alexander the Great in memory of his famous charger, which was killed in the battle with Porus at the crossing of the Jhelum; but doubts have been cast on the identification. Remains of ancient walls still crown the summit of the hills, which rise to a height of 1,000 feet above the village. Coins found among the\nruins date back to the period of the Graeco-Bactrian kings. Even in the time of Akbar, the town covered a site four times as large as that which it now occupies; but since the foundation of Pind D\u0101dan Kh\u0101n, and the shifting of the river channel 2 miles eastward, it has undergone a constant decay. Jal\u0101lpur is now nothing more than a small agricultural village, of no importance apart from the interest attaching to its antiquarian remains.\n\n**Jal\u0101lpur Town (3)** (or Jal\u0101lpur P\u012brw\u0101l\u0101).\u2014Town in the Shuj\u0101b\u0101d tahsil of Mult\u0101n District, Punjab, situated in $29^\\circ 32' N.$ and $71^\\circ 14' E.$, on the banks of an old bed of the Be\u0101s called the Bhat\u0101ri. Population (1901), 5,149. It is called P\u012brw\u0101l\u0101 after Saiyid Sult\u0101n Ahmad Katt\u0101l, generally known as P\u012br Katt\u0101l, a Muhammadan saint, pilgrim, and missionary, and descendant of Saiyid Jal\u0101l of Uch, who died here in 1631. A fine domed building, covered with blue glazed tiles, built in 1745, marks his tomb; and at the large fairs held here on every Friday in the month of Chait (March\u2013April), evil spirits are exorcised from Muhammadan women by day and from Hindu women by night. The municipality was created in 1873. The income during the ten years ending 1902\u20133 averaged Rs. 5,000, and the expenditure Rs. 5,200. The income in 1903\u20134 was Rs. 4,600, chiefly from octroi; and the expenditure was Rs. 5,200. The town has a dispensary, and a vernacular middle school maintained by the municipality. Its trade has greatly decayed since the opening of the railway.\n\n**Jal\u0101lpur Town (4).**\u2014Town in the Akbarpur tahsil of Fyz\u0101b\u0101d District, United Provinces, situated in $26^\\circ 19' N.$ and $82^\\circ 45' E.$ Population (1901), 7,265. The town is picturesquely placed on the high bank of the Tons (Eastern), which winds in a deep channel through a fertile and well-wooded landscape. An im\u0101mb\u0101ra outside the town was built in the eighteenth century at a cost of Rs. 4,000 by contribution from the weavers, each man contributing a quarter of a pie for each piece of cloth woven by him. Jal\u0101lpur is administered under Act XX of 1856, with an income of about Rs. 1,500. There is still a flourishing manufacture of cotton cloth, but many of the Jul\u0101h\u0101s (Muhammadan weavers) go to Bombay, Calcutta, and Cawnpore to work in the mills. A school has 235 pupils.\n\n**J\u0101landhar.**\u2014Division, District, tahsil, and town in the Punjab. See Jullundur.\n\n**Jalangi** (or Khari\u0101).\u2014One of the three rivers of Nadi\u0101 District, Bengal, known as the Nadi\u0101 Rivers, the other two being the Bh\u0101girathi and the M\u0101t\u0101bh\u0101nga. The Jalangi leaves the Ganges, at the point where it enters Nadi\u0101 District in $24^\\circ 11' N.$ and $88^\\circ 43' E.$, and meanders along the north-west of the District for 50 miles, separating it from Murshid\u0101b\u0101d. It then flows to the south past Krishnagar, the chief town of the District, whence it turns westward,\nand after a total course of 121 miles meets the Bh\u0101\u1e45rathi at Nadi\u0101 town in 23\u00b0 25' N. and 88\u00b0 24' E., the united stream taking the name of the Hooghly. The Jalangi, which was at one time the principal outlet for the Ganges, has, like the other head-waters of the Hooghly, a tendency to silt up, and 36 miles of the upper Jalangi have in fact almost entirely closed. It now derives its main water-supply from the Ganges through the old channel of the upper Bha\u012brab, and with it forms part of the Nadi\u0101 Rivers system. Considerable difficulties have been experienced in keeping the channel open for navigation. The Jalangi is navigable during the rainy season by country boats of 4 tons burden, but in the hot season it is little more than a string of marshes connected by shoals and is fordable at many points. Navigation is always a matter of great difficulty at this time, and is in most years impossible. The principal marts on its banks are Krishnagar, Karimpur, Ch\u0101pra, and Swar\u016bpganj; their trade is chiefly in grain, oilseeds, and molasses.\n\nJal\u0101pah\u0101r.\u2014Hill in the head-quarters subdivision of Darjeeling District, Bengal, situated in 27\u00b0 1' N. and 88\u00b0 16' E., above the station of Darjeeling. Jal\u0101pah\u0101r, which forms part of Darjeeling cantonment, is a convalescent d\u00e9p\u00f4t garrisoned by a company of the British infantry regiment quartered at Lebong. Barracks were built at Jal\u0101pah\u0101r as far back as 1848, but these have been enlarged and now provide accommodation for 400 men. The parade ground is 7,520 feet above sea-level.\n\nJal\u0101rpet.\u2014Village in the Tiruppatt\u016br taluk of Salem District, Madras, situated in 12\u00b0 35' N. and 78\u00b0 34' E. Population (1901), 2,051. It is of importance owing to its railway station, which is the junction of the south-west line of the Madras Railway with the Bangalore branch. Of late years it has also been the station at which passengers proceeding towards Madras have been examined to make sure that they are free from plague. Distance from Madras 132 miles, from Bangalore 87 miles.\n\nJ\u0101laun District.\u2014District in the Allah\u0101b\u0101d Division of the United Provinces, lying between 25\u00b0 46' and 26\u00b0 27' N. and 78\u00b0 56' and 79\u00b0 52' E., with an area of 1,480 square miles. J\u0101laun is the most northern of the Districts of British Bundelkhand, and is roughly triangular in shape, the boundaries being chiefly formed by the Jumna and its tributaries, the Betw\u0101 and Pah\u016bj. On the north and north-east the Jumna divides it from Et\u0101wah and Cawnpore; on the south-east its greatly indented boundary marches with that of the Baoni State; on the south the Betw\u0101 separates J\u0101laun from Jh\u0101nsi and Ham\u012brpur, and the Samthar State forms part of the boundary; on the west the Pah\u016bj generally runs between J\u0101laun and the State of Gwalior, except where a portion of the Dati\u0101 State enters the former like a wedge.\nJ\u0101laun lies entirely within the level plain of Bundelkhand. Its highest portions are on the borders, especially near the Jumna, while the lowlands occupy the central part and are chiefly drained by two separate channels which unite as they approach the Jumna, the combined stream being called the Non. An important feature of these channels, and still more so of the larger rivers, is the intricate reticulation of deep ravines which fringe them, including about one-fifth of the total area of the District. The course of the Jumna is from north-west to south-east, while the Pah\u016bj runs from south to north and the Betw\u0101 from west to east. The junction of the Pah\u016bj with the Jumna is on the northern frontier.\n\nJ\u0101laun consists almost entirely of alluvium. Kankar or nodular limestone is the chief mineral found; but stone and gravel are obtained near Saidnagar.\n\nThe District presents no peculiarities from a botanical point of view. It is very sparsely wooded, especially in the black-soil tracts in the south. Bab\u016bl (Acacia arabica) is found everywhere in waste land, while khair (Acacia Catechu) grows in the ravines. Plantations of bab\u016bl under the management of the Forest department are being undertaken near K\u0101lp\u012b to supply the Cawnpore tanneries. K\u0101ns grass (Saccharum spontaneum) is a great pest, recurring in cycles.\n\nTigers are hardly ever met with, but wild hog, antelope, leopards, and hyenas are numerous. The poorer classes residing on the banks of the three principal rivers use fish as an article of diet to a considerable extent.\n\nThe climate is hot and dry, but not unhealthy. The average monthly temperature ranges from about 65\u00b0 in January to 96\u00b75\u00b0 in May. The annual rainfall over the whole District averages 32 inches, and there is little difference between the amounts received in different portions. Great variations occur, however, from year to year. In 1868\u20139 the fall was only 13 inches, while it was as much as 51 inches in 1894\u20135.\n\nNo details are known of the ancient history of this tract, which was not a political entity till the eighteenth century. The town of K\u0101lp\u012b was conquered by Kutb-ud-din in 1196. Owing to its importance as guarding a main crossing of the Jumna, it was held by a strong garrison and became a starting-point for expeditions into Central India and the Deccan, and later a fortress on the route from Agra to Bengal. In the long struggle between the kings of Delhi and Jaunpur during the first eighty years of the fifteenth century K\u0101lp\u012b was the scene of fierce battles and sieges. The Hindu confederacy against B\u0101bar met here, and advanced to experience a crushing defeat near Fatehpur Sikri in Agra District. During the next thirty years K\u0101lp\u012b was taken and retaken several times, and under\nAkbar it became the head-quarters of a sark\u0101r. The Bundel\u0101s had for a short time held K\u0101lp\u012b in the fourteenth century, and towards the end of Akbar's reign assumed a threatening attitude. B\u012br Singh Deo, R\u0101j\u0101 of Orchh\u0101, occupied the greater part of J\u0101laun District and was confirmed in his possessions by Jah\u0101ng\u012br. He revolted when Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n came to the throne, and after a long struggle lost all his influence in this tract. Another branch of the Bundel\u0101s which had gradually acquired power in Ham\u012brpur District now became prominent, and Chhatars\u0101l, its great leader, included J\u0101laun in his dominions. Early in the eighteenth century, however, when attacked by the governor of Allah\u0101b\u0101d, he called in the Mar\u0101th\u0101s to aid him. At his death about 1734 he bequeathed one-third of his possessions, including this District, to his allies. Under Mar\u0101th\u0101 rule the country was a prey to constant anarchy and intestine strife. In the wars which took place at the close of the eighteenth century K\u0101lp\u012b was taken by the British in 1798, but subsequently abandoned. Part of the District was ceded by the Peshw\u0101 in 1803 for the maintenance of troops, by a treaty modifying the terms of the Treaty of Bassein a year earlier; but the fort of K\u0101lp\u012b was held by Gobind Rao on behalf of Shamsher Bah\u0101dur (see B\u0100ND\u0100 DISTRICT) and was taken after a short siege. A tract near the Jumna was assigned to Himmat Bah\u0101dur, who had aided the British, and in 1806 Gobind Rao submitted and was restored to his possessions.\n\nPortions of the present District in the K\u0101lp\u012b and K\u016bnch tahs\u012bls were included in the British District of Bundelkhand. The J\u0101laun estate was seriously misgoverned, and in 1838 the British Government assumed its management. It lapsed in 1840, and during the next few years additions were made by conquest, by treaties with the R\u0101j\u0101s of Jh\u0101nsi and Gwalior, and by lapse. In 1853 the southern portion of the present Ham\u012brpur District, which had been administered by the Deputy-Superintendent of J\u0101laun, was transferred to Ham\u012brpur, and K\u016bnch and K\u0101lp\u012b were attached to J\u0101laun. In 1854 and 1856 further transfers were made to Jh\u0101nsi District, and J\u0101laun assumed its present form subject to a further transfer to Sindhia in 1861.\n\nNews of the rising at Cawnpore reached Orai early in June, and shortly afterwards intelligence arrived that the Europeans at Jh\u0101nsi had been massacred. Thereupon the men of the 53rd Native Infantry deserted; and on June 15 the Jh\u0101nsi mutineers reached the District and murdered all the Europeans on whom they could lay their hands. Meanwhile Kesho Rao, chief of Gursarai, assumed supreme authority. He kept a few European officers as prisoners for some months, until after the defeat of the infamous N\u0101na S\u0101hib and his flight from Cawnpore; but those events induced him to change his tone and to treat with Colonel Neill for their restoration. After sending them in safety to Cawnpore, the chief established himself for a time at J\u0101laun; but\nupon the arrival of T\u0101nti\u0101 Topi in October the usual anarchic quarrels arose. Kesho Rao was deposed; his son was seized by the rebels; and the mutineers of J\u0101laun, joining those of Gwalior, set out for Cawnpore. Meanwhile the populace everywhere revelled in the licence of plunder and murder which the Mutiny had spread through Bundelkhand. In May, 1858, after the fall of Jh\u0101nsi, Sir Hugh Rose\u2019s force entered the District and routed the rebels at K\u016bnch. There he left some troops of the Gursarai chief, whose allegiance had returned with the advent of the British forces. A Deputy-Commissioner was put in charge of the District at K\u016bnch, and Sir Hugh Rose advanced to attack the strong rebel position at K\u0101lp\u012b. On May 23 he drove them from that post and shortly afterwards marched in pursuit towards Gwalior. Unfortunately he was unable to leave any troops in garrison, except a small body to guard the passage at K\u0101lp\u012b; and accordingly on his withdrawal the western portion of the District relapsed once more into anarchy. Plundering went on as before; and in July and August the rebels again attacked and pillaged K\u016bnch and J\u0101laun. The latter town was immediately recovered by a detachment from the garrison at K\u0101lp\u012b; but it was not till September that the guerrilla leaders were defeated, and some further time elapsed before the work of reorganization could be effected.\n\nJ\u0101laun was treated as \u2018non-regulation\u2019 up to 1891, when it was made subject to the ordinary laws in force in the United Provinces, some of which had already been introduced.\n\nThe District is not rich in antiquities. A few carved pillars and stones which may possibly be of the Chandel period have been found at Orai. The great battle in which Prithwi R\u0101j of Delhi defeated Parm\u0101l, the last great Chandel ruler of Bundelkhand, is said to have taken place at a village called Akori in the Orai tahsil. K\u0101lp\u012b, the most celebrated historical place in the District, contains a number of Muhammadan tombs.\n\nThere are 6 towns and 837 villages in J\u0101laun. Population shows considerable fluctuations, owing to the vicissitudes of season to which all Bundelkhand is liable. The numbers at the last four enumerations were as follows: (1872) 404,447, (1881) 418,142, (1891) 399,361, and (1901) 399,726. There are four tahsils\u2014Orai, K\u0101lp\u012b, J\u0101laun, and K\u016bnch\u2014each named from its head-quarters. The principal towns are the municipalities of K\u016bnch, K\u0101lp\u012b, and Orai, the District head-quarters. The table on the next page gives the chief statistics of population in 1901.\n\nHindus form nearly 94 per cent. of the total population, and Musalm\u0101ns only 6 per cent. The density of population is considerably higher than in the other Bundelkhand Districts, owing to the absence of the rocky hills and jungle wastes which characterize the latter.\nJ\u0101laun was the only Bundelkhand District in which the population did not decrease between 1891 and 1901, and this result may safely be ascribed to the Betw\u0101 Canal. Practically the whole population speaks Western Hindi, the prevailing dialect being Bundeli.\n\n| Tahsil | Area in square miles | Number of Towns | Villages | Population | Population per square mile | Percentage of variation in population between 1891 and 1901 | Number of persons able to read and write |\n|--------|---------------------|----------------|----------|------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Orai   | 311                 | 2              | 195      | 59,965     | 190                       | -12.7                                           | 3,445                                  |\n| K\u0101lp\u012b  | 497                 | 1              | 154      | 75,692     | 186                       | -3.9                                            | 2,074                                  |\n| J\u0101laun | 424                 | 2              | 381      | 160,381    | 378                       | +9.0                                            | 6,959                                  |\n| K\u016bnch  | 338                 | 1              | 197      | 104,588    | 309                       | +1.7                                            | 4,451                                  |\n| District total | 1,480 | 6              | 837      | 399,726    | 270                       | +0.8                                            | 17,529                                 |\n\nCham\u0101rs (leather-workers and cultivators), 68,000, are the most numerous Hindu caste. Other large castes are Br\u0101hmans, 50,000; R\u0101jputs, 35,000; K\u0101chhis (cultivators), 27,000; Kor\u012bs (weavers), 20,000; and Ah\u012brs (graziers), 19,000. The Basors (5,000) and Khan-g\u0101rs (6,000) are menial classes peculiar to this part of Bundelkhand. Among Musalm\u0101ns, there are 11,000 Shaikhs and 6,000 Path\u0101ns, but many of these are descended from converted Hindus. Agriculture supports 61 per cent. of the total population, and general labour 10 per cent. R\u0101jputs, Kurmis, and Br\u0101hmans are the chief land-holders.\n\nThere were 59 native Christians in 1901, but no missions have permanent stations in the District.\n\nThe southern portion of J\u0101laun forms a rich basin of the black soils of Bundelkhand (m\u0101r and k\u0101bar), in which excellent wheat can be grown in favourable seasons without irrigation. Unfortunately it becomes overgrown, when cultivation is relaxed, by the weed called k\u0101ns, which spreads rapidly and finally stops the plough. Towards the north the soil is brown or yellow, called p\u0101rv\u0101; this resembles the loam of the Do\u0101b and requires irrigation. Near the ravines which border the rivers, the soil is denuded of its more valuable constituents and becomes exceedingly poor; but there is valuable grazing near the Jumna and Betw\u0101, and ghi is made by the Ah\u012brs who graze large herds of cattle there. Field embankments are also made, which prevent erosion and, by holding up water, stop the growth of k\u0101ns and retain moisture.\n\nThe ordinary tenures of the United Provinces are found, zamind\u0101ri and pattid\u0101ri mah\u0101ls being the commonest. A few estates are held on the ub\u0101r\u012b tenure, which implies a reduction of the full revenue demand on varying conditions (see Jh\u0101nsi District). The main agricultural statistics for 1899\u20131901 are given on the next page, in square miles.\n\n1 Later figures are not available owing to settlement operations.\nThe principal food-crops are gram, *jauv\u0101r*, and wheat, which covered 333, 123, and 103 square miles respectively. *Arhar* (81 square miles), *bajra* (69), and barley (15) are less important. Oilseeds (48 square miles) and cotton (59) are the chief non-food crops; but hemp (*san*) and poppy are also grown to a small extent.\n\nJ\u0101laun, like the rest of Bundelkhand, is liable to great fluctuations in agricultural prosperity. If the spring harvest is injured, whether by blight or by excess or deficiency of rain, cultivation relaxes, or wheat is replaced by inferior staples, and *k\u0101ns* spreads rapidly, throwing land out of cultivation. No material improvements have been made in agricultural methods, though many years ago it was attempted to introduce American varieties of cotton near K\u0101lp\u012b. Endeavours are now being made to encourage rice cultivation, and an experimental farm is under consideration. Part of the District has been rendered more secure by canal-irrigation, which will be referred to later. Advances under the Land Improvement and Agriculturists\u2019 Loans Acts are freely taken, especially in bad years. A total of 5 lakhs was advanced during the ten years ending 1900, including 3 lakhs in the two famine years 1895\u20137; and Rs. 16,000 was lent between 1900 and 1904.\n\nThe cattle of J\u0101laun are inferior to those found south of the Betw\u0101. Attempts have been made to introduce better strains, but hitherto without success. No horses are bred, and the ponies, sheep, and goats are all of an ordinary type.\n\nUp to 1886 the District had no sources of irrigation except wells; and owing to the peculiarities of the black soils, *m\u0101r* and *k\u0101bar*, and the great depth of the spring-level the area irrigated was small. The opening of the Betw\u0101 Canal has led to a considerable increase in the irrigated area. This work enters the District in the south-west and has two branches, which supply almost every part of the District. Though the cultivators did not at first take water readily, the famine of 1896\u20137 opened their eyes to the value of the canal. In that year the area irrigated, which had been only 12 square miles in 1894\u20135, rose to 128 square miles. Water is now freely taken for *parwa*, or loam; and the area of black soil irrigated, especially *k\u0101bar*, is increasing steadily. The area irrigated in 1899\u20131901 from canals was 38, and from wells 9 square miles. At present the irrigation is almost entirely confined to\nthe spring crops, as the supply is exhausted by the beginning of the hot season; but a second reservoir is being constructed to increase the supply.\n\n*Kankar* or calcareous limestone and saltpetre are the only mineral products.\n\nJ\u0101laun was formerly noted for the production of cotton cloth: but the competition of machine-made cloth from Cawnpore has materially affected the industry, and the cultivation of *\u0101l* (*Morinda citrifolia*), from which a valuable red dye was made, has ceased since the introduction of aniline colours. Cotton-dyeing and printing still survive on a small scale at Saidnagar and Kotra. There are two small cotton-gins at K\u0101lp\u012b and a larger one at Ait, while another has recently been completed at K\u00fcnch.\n\nThe principal exports are gram, oilseeds, cotton, and *gh\u012b*. The bark of the *babul* is now being sent in increasing quantities to Cawnpore for use in tanning, and a plantation is being made near K\u0101lp\u012b. The gram is sent to Southern and Western India, oilseeds to Bombay, cotton to Cawnpore and Bombay, and *gh\u012b* to Bengal. K\u00fcnch, K\u0101lp\u012b, J\u0101laun, R\u0101mpura, and M\u0101dhgarh are the chief trade centres.\n\nThe south of the District is crossed by the Indian Midland section of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway from Jh\u0101nsi to Cawnpore, and a short branch connects Ait with K\u00fcnch. There are 669 miles of roads, of which 130 are metalled. The latter are in charge of the Public Works department, but the cost of all but 45 miles of metalled roads is met from Local funds. Avenues of trees are maintained on 109 miles. The main lines are the roads from Cawnpore and Saugor, and from Orai to K\u00fcnch, J\u0101laun, and M\u0101dhgarh.\n\nDrought and blight are the two great scourges of J\u0101laun, and famine and scarcity occurred in 1783, in 1833, in 1837, and in 1848. The rains of 1868 failed and the autumn harvest was only about one-third of the normal, while the following spring harvest, which benefited by an opportune fall in September, 1868, gave rather more than half an average crop. There was great distress, especially in the remote southern villages, until the monsoon of 1869, and relief was given and works were opened. A still worse calamity was experienced in the years 1895\u20137. Previous seasons had injured the crops and *k\u0101ns* had spread considerably. The rains of 1895 ceased prematurely, and relief was necessary early in 1896. By May the numbers on relief rose above 40,000, but the approach of the rains sent the people back to their villages. The monsoon of 1896, however, was even weaker than that of the previous year, and relief operations were again required. By April, 1897, there were 127,000 persons in receipt of relief, and before the next harvest nearly 35 per cent. of the\ntotal population had been relieved. Between October, 1896, and the same month in 1897 nearly 12 lakhs was spent by Government.\n\nThe Collector is assisted by three Deputy-Collectors recruited in India, and a tahsildar is stationed at the headquarters of each tahsil.\n\nThere is one regular Munsif. Jalaun lies in the jurisdiction of the Civil Judge and Sub-Judge of Jhansi, and also in the Jhansi Sessions division. A Special Judge is at present carrying out inquiries under the Bundelkhand Encumbered Estates Act. Crime is on the whole light, but outbreaks of dacoities occur not infrequently, and the difficulty in breaking up gangs is increased by the proximity of Native States.\n\nThe District includes three large estates, Rampura, Jagamanpur, and Gopalgura, for which no detailed statistics are available, the total area of the three being about 85 square miles. A fixed revenue of Rs. 4,500 is paid for Jagamanpur, and the other two are held revenue free. For the first time since its existence in its present form, the settlement of the whole of Jalaun District is now being revised simultaneously. Portions of the Kunch and Kalpi tahsils were first settled as part of the Bundelkhand District and afterwards of Hamirpur, the first regular settlement being made in 1840-1. This was revised in the usual manner in 1872, the term being fixed for thirty years. The remainder of the District was assessed summarily for short terms from 1839 to 1863. The first regular settlement, which should have commenced earlier, but was postponed by the Mutiny, was carried out between 1860 and 1863, and was confirmed for a period of twenty years. It was revised between 1885 and 1887, and the operations are noteworthy as being the first in the United Provinces in which the rules directed that rent-rolls should form the chief basis of assessment. At that time the revenue of the portions settled in 1872 was 2.9 lakhs. The revenue on the rest of the District was enhanced from 6.3 to 7.5 lakhs, the demand falling at 47 per cent. of the corrected rental. A series of bad seasons followed, and in 1893 reductions were made. The famine of 1895-7 necessitated further reductions of revenue, and in 1903-4 the demand stood at 9.8 lakhs. The whole District has now been brought under the special system of settlement in force in Bundelkhand, by which revenue is liable to revision every five years.\n\nCollections on account of land revenue and total revenue have been, in thousands of rupees:\n\n| Year     | Land Revenue | Total Revenue |\n|----------|--------------|---------------|\n| 1880-1   | 9.10         | 11.81         |\n| 1890-1   | 10.35        | 13.58         |\n| 1900-1   | 9.39         | 12.28         |\n| 1903-4   | 8.02         | 9.01          |\nThere are three municipalities, and two towns are administered under Act XX of 1856. Beyond the limits of these, local affairs are managed by the District board, which had an income in 1903-4 of Rs. 87,000, half of which was derived from rates. The expenditure was Rs. 88,000, including Rs. 50,000 spent on roads and buildings.\n\nThe District Superintendent of police has a force of 3 inspectors, 83 subordinate officers, and 360 constables, distributed in 17 police stations, besides 100 municipal and town police, and 1,200 rural and road police. A special force is maintained along the frontier of the Native States as a guard against dacoits. The District jail contained a daily average of 157 prisoners in 1903.\n\nJ\u0101laun takes a high place as regards the literacy of its inhabitants, of whom 4\u00b74 (8\u00b74 males and 0\u00b71 females) could read and write in 1901. The total number of public schools rose from 102 with 2,530 pupils in 1880-1 to 112 with 3,944 pupils in 1900-1. In 1903-4 there were 140 such institutions with 5,184 pupils, including 271 girls, besides 58 private schools with 890 pupils. The education imparted is almost entirely primary, and only six schools were classed as secondary. No schools are managed by Government, but 92 are managed by the District and municipal boards. Out of a total expenditure on education of Rs. 26,000, Local funds provided Rs. 22,000 and fees Rs. 4,000.\n\nThere are 7 hospitals and dispensaries, with accommodation for 73 in-patients. About 55,000 cases were treated in 1903, including 895 in-patients, and 2,600 operations were performed. The total expenditure was Rs. 13,000, chiefly met from Local funds.\n\nIn 1903-4, 15,000 persons were successfully vaccinated, representing a proportion of 37 per 1,000 of population. Vaccination is compulsory only in the municipalities.\n\n[District Gazetteer, 1874 (under revision); Settlement Reports by P. J. White, Kunch, 1874; Kalpi, 1875; remaining portion of District, 1889.]\n\nJ\u0101laun Tahsil.\u2014Northern tahsil of J\u0101laun District, United Provinces, comprising the pargana of J\u0101laun and part of M\u0101dhogarh, and lying between 26\u00b0 and 26\u00b0 27' N. and 79\u00b0 3' and 79\u00b0 31' E., with an area of 424 square miles. Population increased from 147,090 in 1891 to 160,381 in 1901, the rate of increase being the highest in the District. There are 381 villages and two towns, including J\u0101laun (population, 8,573), the tahsil head-quarters. The demand for land revenue in 1903-4 was Rs. 3,16,000, and for cesses Rs. 51,000. The density of population, 378 persons per square mile, is the highest in the District. The tahsil is bordered on the west by the Pah\u016bj and on the north by the Jumna, both of these rivers having a fringe of ravines. In the south and east the rich black soil called mair is found;\nbut this tract has suffered recently from bad seasons. North of the m\u0101r is a tract of k\u0101bar, or lighter-coloured soil, which largely depends on rain at particular seasons for its cultivation. The north, west, and north-east of the tahsil consists of a loam tract, which is served by the Kuthaund branch of the Betw\u0101 Canal, and is one of the most stable portions of this very precarious District. In 1900\u20131 the area under cultivation was 275 square miles, of which 25 were irrigated.\n\nJ\u0101laun Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the tahsil of the same name in J\u0101laun District, United Provinces, situated in 26\u00b0 8' N. and 79\u00b0 21' E., on a metalled road 13 miles from Orai, the District head-quarters. Population (1901), 8,573. During the eighteenth century J\u0101laun was the capital of a Mar\u0101th\u0101 State, and nearly all the respectable inhabitants are still Mar\u0101th\u0101 Br\u0101hmans, many of whom enjoy pensions and rent-free grants. Besides the tahsil offices, the town contains a dispensary and a tahsil school with 144 pupils. It is administered under Act XX of 1856, with an income of about Rs. 1,300. Trade is small, but increasing. A fine market was built in 1881, and a number of M\u0101rw\u0101r\u012b bankers are settled here.\n\nJalesar Tahsil.\u2014South-western tahsil of Etah District, United Provinces, conterminous with the pargana of the same name, lying between 27\u00b0 18' and 27\u00b0 35' N. and 78\u00b0 11' and 78\u00b0 31' E., with an area of 227 square miles. Population increased from 121,030 in 1891 to 133,399 in 1901. There are 156 villages and two towns, including Jalesar (population, 14,348), the tahsil head-quarters. The demand for land revenue in 1903\u20134 was Rs. 2,76,000, and for cesses Rs. 45,000; but under the new settlement these figures will be raised to Rs. 2,88,000 and Rs. 47,000. The density of population, 588 persons per square mile, is the highest in the District. The tahsil forms an almost unbroken plain. The Rind or Arind touches the north-east corner; but the chief river is the Sengar, known in this part of its course also as the Isan. Irrigation is provided by means of the Et\u0101wah branch of the Upper Ganges Canal. The tahsil is generally fertile, but is crossed by a line of sandhills, and is interspersed with patches of barren soil or \u012bsar and marshes. The drainage has recently been improved. In 1898\u20139 the area under cultivation was 148 square miles, of which 87 were irrigated. The canal serves more than a third of the irrigated area, and wells supply most of the remainder. In dry seasons the Sengar or Isan is largely used as a source of irrigation.\n\nJalesar Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the tahsil of the same name in Etah District, United Provinces, situated in 27\u00b0 28' N. and 78\u00b0 19' E., on the road from Muttra to Etah town, 8\u00bd miles from Jalesar Road station on the East Indian Railway. Population (1901), 14,348. The town consists of two parts, the fort and the lower town. The fort is said to have been erected by a R\u0101n\u0101 of Mew\u0101r in the fifteenth century;\nbut nothing remains of the buildings except a mound on which the tahsili, munsifi, police station, and municipal hall now stand. The lower town is a collection of narrow streets and lanes, the drainage of which was very defective, but the municipality has completed an efficient drainage scheme, through the Canal department. The streets are well paved and there is a dispensary. Jalesar has been a municipality since 1866. During the ten years ending 1901 the income and expenditure averaged Rs. 10,000. In 1903-4 the income was Rs. 14,000, chiefly from octroi (Rs. 11,000); and the expenditure was Rs. 13,000. There is not much trade; but cotton cloth, glass bangles, and pewter ornaments are made, and the largest saltpetre factory in the District is situated here. The R\u0101j\u0101 of Awa has opened a cotton-gin, which employed 125 hands in 1903. A tahsili school has about 130 pupils, and the municipality maintains two schools and aids six others with a total attendance of 331.\n\nJaleswar (or Jellasore).\u2014Village in the head-quarters subdivision of Balasore District, Bengal, situated in 21\u00b0 49' N. and 87\u00b0 13' E., on the left bank of the Subarnarekh\u0101, 12 miles from its mouth. It lies on the Calcutta high road, and is also a station (Jellasore) on the Bengal-N\u0101gpur Railway. It was formerly the capital of a Muhammadan sark\u0101r comprising the present District of Midnapore. During the eighteenth century the East India Company had a factory here.\n\nJ\u0101lgaon T\u0101luk.\u2014T\u0101luk of Buld\u0101na District, Ber\u0101r, lying between 20\u00b0 65' and 21\u00b0 13' N. and 76\u00b0 23' and 76\u00b0 48' E., with an area of 410 square miles. The population fell from 97,798 in 1891 to 87,192 in 1901, the density in the latter year being 212 persons per square mile. The t\u0101luk contains 155 villages and one town, J\u0101lgaon (population, 8,487), the head-quarters. The demand for land revenue in 1903-4 was Rs. 3,54,000, and for cesses Rs. 28,000. J\u0101lgaon, which is the smallest t\u0101luk in Ber\u0101r in respect of area and, except the Melgh\u0101t, of population also, lies entirely in the fertile valley of the Purna, which bounds it on the south. On the north it is bounded by the low hills of the western portion of the G\u0101wilgarh range. Until August, 1905, when it was transferred to Buld\u0101na, the t\u0101luk formed part of Akola District.\n\nJ\u0101lgaon Town (1).\u2014Head-quarters of the t\u0101luk of the same name in Buld\u0101na District, Ber\u0101r, situated in 21\u00b0 3' N and 76\u00b0 35' E. Population (1901), 8,487. The town is sometimes called J\u0101lgaon-J\u0101mod from a village near it, to distinguish it from J\u0101lgaon in Kh\u0101ndesh. It is mentioned in the Ain-i-Akbari as a pargana town in the sark\u0101r of Narn\u0101la. It contains five ginning factories and a cotton market.\n\nJ\u0101lgaon T\u0101luka.\u2014T\u0101luk of East Kh\u0101ndesh District, Bombay, lying between 20\u00b0 47' and 21\u00b0 11' N. and 75\u00b0 24' and 75\u00b0 45' E., with an area of 319 square miles. There are two towns, J\u0101lgaon\n(population, 16,259), the head-quarters, and Nasirabad (12,176); and 89 villages. The population in 1901 was 85,151, compared with 83,982 in 1871. The density, 269 persons to the square mile, is much above the District average. The demand for land revenue in 1903\u20134 was 2-8 lakhs, and for cesses Rs. 18,000. J\u0101lgaon is a rich black plain to the north, and hilly or undulating to the south. The climate is generally healthy.\n\nJ\u0101lgaon Town (2).\u2014Head-quarters of East Kh\u0101ndesh District, Bombay, and of the taluka of the same name, situated in 21\u00b0 1' N. and 75\u00b0 35' E., on the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, 261 miles northeast of Bombay. Population (1901), 16,259. Situated in the centre of a rich cotton-growing District, J\u0101lgaon rose in the nineteenth century to the position of an important mercantile town. During the American Civil War (1862\u20135) it was the great cotton mart of Kh\u0101ndesh. It suffered severely from the fall in value at the close of the war, but its trade has recovered. The chief articles of commerce are cotton, linseed, and sesamum. In 1903 there were 6 cotton-presses, 2 large cotton-ginning factories, and one cotton-spinning and weaving mill, all worked by steam. In the same year the number of looms was 425 and of spindles 20,948, while the out-turn amounted to 2 million pounds of yarn and 1\u00bd million pounds of cloth. The town has been greatly improved. A new suburb, Pollen-peth, has been built, and a market-place laid out. The municipality has made a garden on the site of part of the old cotton market. One of the most striking of many handsome buildings in the new suburb is a three-storeyed dwelling built by the p\u0101tel or headman of P\u0101tri. Water is carried through iron pipes from the Mehrun lake, 2 miles distant. A metalled road connects J\u0101lgaon and Neri, 14 miles distant, 24 miles beyond which are the celebrated Ajanta caves. The municipality was created in 1864. The municipal income during the decade ending 1901 averaged Rs. 37,000. In 1903\u20134 the income was Rs. 41,000. The town contains a Subordinate Judge's court, a dispensary, and six schools, with 574 pupils, of which one, with 63 pupils, is for girls. A branch of the American Alliance Mission has recently been established here.\n\nJ\u0101lia Amar\u0101j\u012b.\u2014Petty State in K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r, Bombay.\n\nJ\u0101lia Dev\u0101ni.\u2014Petty State in K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r, Bombay.\n\nJ\u0101lia M\u0101naji.\u2014Petty State in K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r, Bombay.\n\nJ\u0101lna Hills.\u2014Range of hills in Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State, running eastward from Daulat\u0101b\u0101d in Aurang\u0101b\u0101d District. Close to the border of Ber\u0101r it is joined by a spur of hills from J\u0101lna in the south, from which the range derives its name. After entering Ber\u0101r it merges into the Sahy\u0101driparvat or S\u0101tm\u0101l\u0101 range. The J\u0101lna Hills are about 2,400 feet high, one of the peaks, Paulat\u0101b\u0101d, being 3,022 feet\nabove the level of the sea. The total length of the range is about 120 miles.\n\n**J\u0101lna T\u0101luk.**\u2014Eastern t\u0101luk of Aurang\u0101b\u0101d District, Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State, with an area of 801 square miles. Its population in 1901, including j\u0101girs, was 113,400, compared with 129,832 in 1891, the decrease being due to the famines of 1897 and 1890-1900. The t\u0101luk contains two towns, J\u0101lna (population, 20,270), the headquarters, and K\u0101dir\u0101b\u0101d (11,159), a large commercial centre; and 219 villages, of which 52 are j\u0101gir. The land revenue in 1901 was 2\u00b75 lakhs. The country is composed of black cotton soil, and is hilly towards the north and east.\n\n**J\u0101lna Town.**\u2014Head-quarters of the t\u0101luk of the same name in Aurang\u0101b\u0101d District, Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State, situated in 19\u00b0 51' N. and 75\u00b0 54' E., on the right bank of the Kundlika, opposite the town of K\u0101dir\u0101b\u0101d. Population (1901), 20,270, of whom 13,851 were Hindus, 5,812 Musalm\u0101ns, and 317 Christians. According to local traditions, J\u0101lna was founded in the time of R\u0101ma. During Sit\u0101's residence it was styled J\u0101nkapur, but the name was changed to J\u0101lna by a rich Musalm\u0101n weaver. Abul Fazl, Akbar's minister, resided here for a time, and Aurangzeb is said to have visited the place occasionally during his viceroyalty. The only public buildings of any note are a mosque and a handsome stone sarai, erected according to the inscriptions on them in 1568, and a Turkish bath. The town also contains a number of less important mosques and shrines, besides three Hindu temples, the principal one being that of Anandi Sw\u0101mi, which is of considerable size. The fort of J\u0101lna, which was built in 1725, is now in ruins. Its gardens produce large quantities of fruit, which is exported to Bombay and elsewhere. The cantonment of J\u0101lna, till recently a station of the Hyder\u0101b\u0101d Contingent, lies to the east of the town; it was built in 1827, but has been abandoned since 1903. There are several places of Christian worship, with a couple of schools attached.\n\n**J\u0101lor.**\u2014Head-quarters of a district of the same name in the State of Jodhpur, R\u0101jput\u0101na, situated in 25\u00b0 21' N. and 72\u00b0 37' E., 75 miles south of Jodhpur city. Population (1901), 7,443. It possesses a post office, an Anglo-veracular school, and a hospital with accommodation for 8 in-patients. The principal manufactures are cotton cloth, camel saddles, and prettily engraved drinking vessels of bell-metal. On a hill to the south and entirely commanding the town stands the fort, one of the most famous in R\u0101jput\u0101na. Built by the Param\u0101ra R\u0101jputs, its walls, composed of huge masses of cut stone, remain even now in a perfect state of preservation, although the place has been many times besieged. The fort is about 800 by 400 yards in extent, and accessible only by an ascent of 3 miles up a steep and\nslippery stone roadway, passing three distinct lines of defence, all of considerable strength. J\u0101lor was held by the Param\u0101ras till towards the end of the twelfth century, when the Chauh\u0101n Rao Kirthi P\u0101l (of N\u0101dol) took it and made it his capital. His grandson Udai Singh surrendered it to Shams-ud-d\u012bn Altamsh about 1210, but it was immediately restored to him. About 100 years later, Al\u0101-ud-d\u012bn, after a lengthy siege, captured it from K\u0101nardeo Chauh\u0101n, and a three-domed mosque, said to have been built by him, is still in good repair and daily use. About 1549 the fort and district passed into the possession of R\u0101j\u0101 M\u0101ldeo of Jodhpur.\n\n**Jalpaiguri District.**\u2014District in the north-east of the R\u0101jsh\u0101hi Division, Eastern Bengal and Assam, lying between 26\u00b0 and 27\u00b0 N. and 88\u00b0 20\u2032 and 89\u00b0 53\u2032 E., with an area of 2,962 square miles. It is bounded on the north by Darjeeling and the State of Bhut\u0101n; on the south by Din\u0101jpur, Rangpur, and the State of Cooch Beh\u0101r; on the west by Din\u0101jpur, Purnea, and Darjeeling; on the east the Sankos river separates it from the Go\u0101lp\u0101ra District of Assam.\n\nThe District comprises two well-defined tracts, which differ alike in history and in administration. The older portion, which is known as the Regulation tract because it is administered under the ordinary laws and regulations in force in Bengal proper, lies for the most part west of the T\u012bsta, though it comprises also the P\u0101tgr\u0101m th\u0101na east of that river. It originally formed part of Rangpur, which it closely resembles. The continuous expanse of level paddy-fields is broken only by the groves of bamboos, palms, and fruit-trees which encircle the homesteads of the substantial tenant-farmers. In this tract there is but little untilled land, with the exception of an extensive and once valuable s\u0101l (Shorea robusta) forest of 60 square miles, which belongs to the Raikat of Baikuntapur.\n\nEast of the T\u012bsta, and hemmed in between the States of Cooch Beh\u0101r on the south and Bhut\u0101n on the north, lies a strip of submontane country 22 miles in width, which was annexed from Bhut\u0101n in 1865, and is known as the Western Duars. This part of the District is flat except in the north-east corner, where the Sinchul\u0101 Hills rise abruptly to a height of from 4,000 to 6,000 feet. On an outlying spur of this range, 2,000 feet in height, is built the military station of Buxa, which commands one of the principal passes into Bhut\u0101n.\n\nThe scenery along the foot of the mountains, where the great rivers debouch upon the plains, is very grand and beautiful, the blue outline of the Bhut\u0101n range forming a magnificent background. The principal rivers, proceeding from west to east, are the Mah\u0101nanda, Karatov\u0101, T\u012bsta, Jaldh\u0101k\u0101, Duduy\u0101, Mujnai, Tors\u0101, K\u0101lj\u0101ni, Raid\u0101k, and Sankos, which all flow down from the hills in a southerly direction and\nultimately discharge their waters by various channels into the Ganges or the Brahmaputra. They are constantly changing their main channels, and the country is everywhere seamed by deserted river-beds. The Jaldh\u0101k\u0101, or Di-chu, drains the eastern slopes of the Rishi La in Darjeeling District, of which it forms the eastern boundary. It joins the Tors\u0101 in Rangpur District, and the combined stream falls into the Brahmaputra by two mouths. Though a wide river, the Jaldh\u0101k\u0101 is very shallow and is fordable in every part during the winter months. The Duduy\u0101 and Mujnai, tributaries of the Jaldh\u0101k\u0101, are navigable throughout the year by boats of 2 tons as far as the Alipur-Jalpaiguri road and F\u0101l\u0101k\u0101t\u0101 respectively. The Tors\u0101 rises in the Chumbi valley of Tibet, where it is known as the Amo-chu, and flows through Bhutan; it is navigable by cargo boats during the rains. The K\u0101lj\u0101ni, which is formed by the combined waters of the Alaikuri and Dim\u0101, after a course of a few miles enters the Cooch Beh\u0101r State; it is used to float down timber from the forests at the foot of the hills. The Raid\u0101k rises near the Chumalhari mountain in Tibet. This river and the Sankos, which forms the boundary between the Eastern and Western Du\u0101rs, thus separating Eastern Bengal from Assam, flow into the Brahmaputra a few miles below Dhubri. Both rivers are navigable by boats of 3 or 4 tons for a considerable portion of their course, but 5 or 10 miles before reaching the hills navigation is impeded by rapids.\n\nWith the exception of the Buxa hills, the District is covered by recent alluvial deposits, consisting of coarse gravels at the foot of the hills, sandy clay and sand along the course of the rivers, and fine sand consolidating into clay in the other parts of the river plain. The Buxa hills are composed of a series of beds named after them, which consist of variegated slates, quartzites, and dolomites, and are fringed on the south by low hills of Upper Tertiary strata. About half a mile west of Buxa copper ore occurs in greenish slate with quartzose layers, and copper ores are found also 4 miles north of S\u0101m Sing Tea Estate, close to the boundary between Jalpaiguri and Darjeeling Districts. Masses of calcareous tufa occur along the base of the hills\u00b9.\n\nIn the regulation portion of the District and the south of the Du\u0101rs the tree vegetation is sparse and rather stunted except in the Baikunt-pur jungle, and the greater portion of the surface is covered with grasses, the commonest of these being Imperata arundinacea and Andropogon aciculatus. Among the trees, the most conspicuous is the red cotton-tree (Bombax malabaricum); the siss\u016b (Dalbergia Sissoo), mango, jack, p\u012bfal, and tamarind occur, as planted or sometimes self-sown species. The villages are surrounded by thickets or shrubberies of semi-spontaneous growth and weedy character. Areca palms are\n\n\u00b9 F. R. Mallet, 'Geology of Darjeeling and Western Du\u0101rs,' Memoirs, Geological Survey of India, vol. xi, part i.\ncommon, and bamboos thrive luxuriantly. Along the north of the Du\u0101rs are large upland tracts of forest, part of which has been 'reserved' and is described below, declining southwards into plains of heavy grass jungle. Many varieties of orchids bloom in the forests; and there is a curious creeper, the p\u0101ni lahr\u0101 (Vitis repanda), from whose stem water is obtained.\n\nThe District is famous for its big game, which include wild elephants, bison, rhinoceros, buffaloes, tigers, leopards, bears, wild hog, swamp deer (Cervus duvauceli), and s\u0101mbhar (Cervus unicolor). A few elephants are caught on behalf of Government. The number of rhinoceros, bison, and buffaloes has been rapidly decreasing; and to prevent their extinction, they are now protected in the 'reserved' forests. Good mahseer fishing is to be had where the Jaldh\u0101k\u0101, Tors\u0101, Raid\u0101k, and Sankos debouch from the Him\u0101layas.\n\nThe temperature is rarely excessive; the mean, which is 62\u00b0 in January, rises to 73\u00b0 in March and 79\u00b0 in April, but it does not reach its highest point until July and August, when it is 83\u00b0. The highest mean maximum is 90\u00b0 in April, and the highest maximum recorded was 103\u00b0 in 1899. Rainfall is exceptionally heavy, the average varying from 122 inches at Jalpaiguri town to 209 inches at Buxa; and the normal mean is 129 inches, of which 12\u00b73 inches occur in May, 25\u00b76 in June, 28\u00b71 in July, 27\u00b74 in August, and 21\u00b74 in September.\n\nIn September, 1902, an exceptionally high flood caused great damage in the tract between Jalpaiguri and Mandalgh\u0101t, bounded on the east by the T\u012bsta and on the west by the railway embankment, and also in the Mayn\u0101gur\u012b tahs\u012bl between the Dharl\u0101 and the T\u012bsta: the roads and the railway embankment were breached, hundreds of cattle were drowned, and ten lives were lost. In the earthquake of 1897 much damage was done to roads by subsidence and the opening of deep fissures, and many bridges and buildings were destroyed.\n\nIn prehistoric times the District formed part of the powerful kingdom of Pr\u0101gjyotisha or K\u0101mar\u016bpa, as it was subsequently called, which extended as far west as the Karatoy\u0101.\n\nHistory. Legend that a temple was originally erected on the site of the present temple at Jalpes by a R\u0101j\u0101 named Jalpeswar, in whose day the Jalpes lingam first appeared. There are extensive remains at Bhittargarh, which is said to have formed the capital of a S\u016bdra king named Prithu. The Bengal P\u0101l dynasty included this District in its dominions; and so did the Khen R\u0101j\u0101s\u2014Niladhwaj, Chakradhwaj, and Nil\u0101mbar\u2014of whom the first founded the city of Kam\u0101t\u0101pur in Cooch Beh\u0101r. It subsequently formed part of the Koch kingdom founded by Biswa Singh; and, when that kingdom fell to pieces, the western part was annexed by the Mughals. There was a long struggle for the possession of P\u0101tgr\u0101m and Bod\u0101: but\nat the beginning of the eighteenth century they were nominally ceded to the Muhammadans, a cousin of the Cooch Behar Raj\u0101 continuing to farm them on his behalf. After the Muhammadan conquest it was included in the frontier faujd\u0101ri (magisterial jurisdiction) of Fakirkundi or Rangpur, and passed to the East India Company with the cession of the D\u012bw\u0101ni in 1765.\n\nThe enormous area of the old District of Rangpur and the weakness of the administrative staff prevented the Collector from preserving order in the more remote parts, which thus became an Alsatia of banditti. In the year 1789 the Collector conducted a regular campaign against these disturbers of the peace, and with a force of 200 barkand\u012bs blockaded them in the great forest of Baikuntpur. They were at last compelled to surrender, and within a single year no less than 549 robbers were brought to trial.\n\nMeanwhile, the Du\u0101rs, or lowland passes, had fallen to the Bhoti\u0101s, who found here the cultivable ground that their own bare mountains did not afford. They exercised predominant influence over the whole tract from the frontier of Sikkim as far east as Darrang, and frequently enforced claims of suzerainty over the enfeebled State of Cooch Behar. They do not appear to have occupied this tract permanently, but merely to have exacted a heavy tribute, and subjected the inhabitants to the cruellest treatment. Cooch Behar was delivered from the Bhoti\u0101 tyranny by the treaty of 1773; but the Bhutan Du\u0101rs, as they were called, remained for nearly a century longer in a state of anarchy. They were annexed after the Bhutan War of 1865; they were then divided into the Eastern and Western Du\u0101rs, of which the former have since been incorporated with the District of Go\u0101lp\u0101ra. In 1867 the D\u0101lingkot subdivision of the Western Du\u0101rs, which lies high up among the mountains, was added to Darjeeling, and the remaining part was in 1869 united with the Tit\u0101lya subdivision of Rangpur to form the new District of Jalpaiguri.\n\nThe permanently settled portion of Jalpaiguri, which includes the old ch\u0101klas of P\u0101tgr\u0101m and Bod\u0101 and the old Raj of Baikuntpur, has no history of its own apart from the parent District of Rangpur. Its boundaries are perplexingly intermingled with those of the State of Cooch Behar, to which, as we have seen, it belonged until comparatively recent times. At the present day by far the wealthiest landowners are the Mah\u0101r\u0101ja of Cooch Behar and the Raikat of Baikuntpur, who is descended from a younger branch of the same family.\n\nIn addition to the old fort at Bhitargarh and the temple at Jalpes, there are the remains at Bod\u0101 of a smaller fort about a mile square, supposed to be coeval with the fort at Bhitargarh. In the south of the District, small forts, temples, and old tanks are numerous.\n\nThe population increased from 417,855 in 1872 to 580,570 in 1881,\nto 680,736 in 1891, and to 787,380 in 1901. Though the figures for 1872 cannot be accepted as accurate, there has been a continuous growth of population due entirely to the rapid development of the Western Du\u0101rs; and in 1901 more than one-fifth of the population was composed of immigrants from elsewhere. Malaria is always prevalent in the tarai, and in eight years of the decade ending 1901 Jalpaiguri figured among the six Districts with the highest recorded mortality from fever in Bengal. Spleen and goitre are common diseases, and the proportion of persons suffering from insanity and deaf-mutism is higher than in most parts of Bengal.\n\nThe chief statistics of the Census of 1901 are shown below:\n\n| Subdivision | Area in square miles | Number of Towns | Villages | Population | Population per square mile | Percentage of variation in population between 1891 and 1901 | Number of persons able to read and write |\n|-------------|---------------------|----------------|----------|------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Jalpaiguri  | 1,820               | 1              | 588      | 668,027    | 367                       | + 9.8                                           | 27,605                                 |\n| Alipur      | 1,142               | 1              | 178      | 119,353    | 105                       | + 64.7                                          | 3,229                                  |\n| District total | 2,962             | 2              | 766      | 787,380    | 266                       | + 15.7                                          | 30,834                                 |\n\nThe two towns are Jalpaiguri, the head-quarters, and the cantonment at Buxa. Outside these, more than half of the population are contained in villages with 2,000 or more inhabitants, and only 13 per cent. in villages with a population of less than 500. The census village in this District was, however, merely a territorial unit and did not correspond to the residential village. The latter, in fact, can scarcely be said to exist; for the country is divided into small farms each with its central homestead, the residence of the farmer or j\u014dt\u0101r, surrounded by the houses of his immediate relatives and perhaps an under-tenant or two. In the north-west of the District the conditions of the tea industry have given rise to large settlements of labourers, the average population of which is over 3,000 souls. The density is very low; in only one th\u0101na does the population exceed 500 per square mile, and in only three more does it exceed 400. The Du\u0101rs, which were very sparsely inhabited when first acquired, carry a smaller population than the rest of the District. Towards the west this tract has filled up rapidly owing to the extension of tea cultivation; but in the east the population is still very scanty, and in the Alipur th\u0101na it averages only 89 persons per square mile, in spite of an increase of 70 per cent. during the last ten years. There is a steady movement of the population from the west of the District towards the extensive tracts of cultivable land east of the Tista, and there is also an enormous immigration of tea-garden coolies from Chot\u0101 Nagpur and the Sant\u0101l Parganas; R\u0101nch\u012b alone supplies 80,000, chiefly Oraons and Mund\u0101s, and the Sant\u0101l Par-\nganas 11,000. Many of these coolies are settling down permanently, either in the gardens or as cultivators and cart-owners, but many return home at intervals. In the tea gardens on the higher slopes at the foot of the hills, Nepalese replace men from Chota Nagpur, and many of these also find a permanent home in the District. Numerous up-country coolies are employed on the roads and railways, but most of them return home at the end of the cold season.\n\nA corrupt dialect of Bengali, known as Rangpuri or Rajbansi, is the language of the District, being spoken by 77 per cent. of the population; Hindi is the language of 6 per cent. and Kurukh of 7 per cent.; Mech is spoken by over 20,000 persons, and Khas, Mundari, and Santali by more than 10,000 each. This great diversity of languages is due to the large number of immigrants. Hindus (534,625) form 68 per cent. of the population, Muhammadans (228,487) 29 per cent., and Animists 2 per cent., while the remainder are Christians or Buddhists.\n\nThe proportion of Muhammadans has declined since 1872, when they formed 34.6 per cent. of the population. They are chiefly Shaikhs and Nasyas, and are, for the most part, converts from the aboriginal Koch and Mech races. They still retain many beliefs and superstitions derived from their ancestors, and live on good terms side by side with the Rajbansi (Koch), to whom more than three-fifths of the Hindu population belong; it is, in fact, not unusual to find Muhammadan and Rajbansi families dwelling together in the same homestead, although in separate houses. The Mechs, a western branch of the great Kachari tribe, number about 22,000, found chiefly in the Alipur and Falakata thanas in the Duars. These, like their Garo neighbours, are a nomadic people, who live by agriculture in its simplest and most primitive form. No less than 89.4 per cent. of the population, or over 700,000 persons, are supported by agriculture\u2014a very high proportion; a sixth of these derive their livelihood from the tea gardens. Of the remainder, industries maintain 4.6, commerce 0.3, and the professions 0.6 per cent.\n\nThe Baptist Missionary Society has a branch in Jalpaiguri town; the Church Missionary Society carries on work among the Santal colony in the Alipur subdivision, the Scandinavian Alliance Mission among the Bhotias, and the Free Church of Scotland among the tea-garden coolies. The number of native Christians is 2,141.\n\nThe alluvial soil with which the greater part of the District is covered is extremely fertile. In the low levels between the Tista and the Sankos coarse rice, oilseeds, potatoes, castor, and areca palms grow abundantly. West of the Tista, a superior variety of jute, known as r\u0101jgauja, is grown, and also fine rice and wheat. In the basin between the Tista and the Jaldhaka a hard black clayey soil is found, which yields excellent pasture and fine Agriculture.\ncrops of tobacco. The ferruginous clay of the uplands in the north of the Du\u0101rs is exceptionally well suited to the tea plant.\n\nThe chief agricultural statistics for 1903-4 are shown below, areas being in square miles:\n\n| Subdivision | Total | Cultivated | Cultivable waste | Forest |\n|-------------|-------|------------|------------------|--------|\n| Jalpaiguri  | 1,820 | 934        | 296              | 137    |\n| Alipur      | 1,142 | 432        | 341              | 359    |\n| **Total**   | **2,962** | **1,366** | **637**          | **496** |\n\nThe staple food-crop of the District is rice, grown on 1,017 square miles, or 74 per cent. of the net area cropped; the winter rice, which is the chief crop, covering 54 per cent. of that area. The cultivation of the early rice, which is sown broadcast on high lands, begins in March. The early varieties, sown in March or April, are reaped in June and July; but the greater part is sown in April and May, and not reaped till August or September. The winter rice is sown broadcast in nurseries in May and June, transplanted from the middle of July to the middle of September, and reaped during December and January. After rice, tobacco is most widely grown, occupying 185 square miles, or nearly 14 per cent. of the cultivated area; Jalpaiguri is, in fact, after Rangpur, the chief tobacco-producing District in Eastern Bengal.\n\nTea is cultivated on 121 square miles, or 9 per cent. of the area under cultivation. This industry was introduced in 1874, and is carried on mainly by European enterprise and with European capital. In 1876 there were thirteen gardens, with an area of 818 acres, yielding 29,520 lb. of tea. The cultivation was very rapidly extended during the last decade of the nineteenth century; and by 1901 the number of gardens had increased to 235, with a planted area of 109 square miles, and an out-turn of over 31,000,000 lb. These gardens also possessed an unplanted area of 255 square miles. In 1903 the number of gardens decreased to 207, but the gross yield in that year amounted to nearly 37,000,000 lb. Jalpaiguri has an important advantage over the tea Districts of Assam, as labour finds its way thither freely and no special law is necessary to enforce labour contracts. The production of tea of late years has increased so much more rapidly than its consumption that there has been a heavy fall in prices, and the industry has suffered in consequence. Jute cultivation is extending rapidly, and in 1903 occupied 103 square miles. Mustard is also widely cultivated, and cotton is grown in small quantities by the G\u0101ros and Mechs on uplands at the foot of the Bhut\u0101n hills.\n\nThe area under cultivation is extending rapidly in the Western Du\u0101rs, where there is still much cultivable waste; the rates of rent are very\nlow, and cultivators are attracted not only from the th\u0101nas west of the Tista, but also from Rangpur and Cooch Beh\u0101r State. Little use has been made of the Agriculturists' and Land Improvement Loans Acts; during the decade ending 1901-2 an average of Rs. 2,000 per annum was advanced under the former Act.\n\nThe local cattle are small and weakly, and no attempts have been made to improve the breed. Pasturage is so abundant that in the northern th\u0101nas of the Western Du\u0101rs rice straw is left to rot in the fields, while large herds of cattle from Bengal and Bhutan are brought to graze in the Baikuntpur jungle during the winter months. Fairs are held at Al\u012bpur, Jalp\u0113s, and F\u0101l\u0101k\u0101t\u0101.\n\nThe soil for the most part derives sufficient moisture from the heavy rainfall, but low lands are in some places irrigated from the hill streams.\n\nJalpaiguri contains extensive forests, which are the property of Government. With the exception of 5 square miles of 'protected' forests in the Government estates of F\u0101l\u0101k\u0101t\u0101 and Mayn\u0101guri, which are managed by the Deputy-Commissioner, these are all 'reserved' forests under the management of the Forest department. The latter in 1903-4 yielded a revenue of Rs. 1,18,000. They are divided into the Jalpaiguri and Buxa divisions, the former comprising all the forests between the Tista and the Tors\u0101 rivers, with an area of 183 square miles; and the latter, those between the Tors\u0101 and the Sankos, with an area of 308 square miles. The trees are of many different kinds, but there are five well-defined types: namely, s\u0101l (Shorea robusta); mixed forest without s\u0101l; mixed chilauni (Schima Wallichii) forest; khair (Acacia Catechu) and siss\u016b (Dalbergia Sissoo) forest; and savannahs. Of these the s\u0101l is the most important, and occurs either nearly pure or mixed with varying proportions of Dillenia pentagyna, Careya arborea, Sterculia villosa, Schima Wallichii, Terminalia tomentosa, and T. bellerica, &c. The mixed forests are composed chiefly of Lagerstroemia parviflora, Callicarpa arborea, Sterculia villosa, Hymen trijuga, and often Terminalia tomentosa and Albizzia. The chilauni type of forest is more clear of other subsidiary species than ordinary mixed forest, the chilauni being the predominant species and growing to a large size. Khair and siss\u016b are found pure in the alluvial deposits of most of the large rivers. The savannahs, or large stretches of grass land devoid of trees, deserve mention both on account of their extent and their bearing on the work of fire protection. The s\u0101l forest belonging to the Raikat of Baikuntpur is now of little value, owing to promiscuous felling. The R\u0101jbansi and Mechs collect what little jungle produce there is, principally chiretta, lac, and beeswax. Small quantities of long pepper (Piper longum) are also collected by the Forest department.\n\nThe only mineral of importance is limestone, which is largely\nquarried in the shape of calcareous tufa along the base of the Bhutan hills. A small copper-mine at Chun\u0101b\u0101ti, 2 miles from Buxa, was formerly worked by Nepalese. Coal is found near B\u0101gr\u0101kot, and a company has been formed to work it.\n\nGunny cloth of a very coarse quality is woven in the western part of the District. The lower classes also manufacture for home use a coarse silk (called endi) from the silk of worms fed on the castor-oil plant, and a striped cotton cloth called phot\u0101.\n\nThe development of the tea industry and the influx of a large cooly population into the Du\u0101rs, combined with the facilities of railway communication, have given a great impetus to trade; and at the large markets which have sprung up in the neighbourhood of the tea gardens, the cultivator finds a ready market for his rice, vegetables, and other produce. There is also a fair amount of trade with Bhutan, which has been stimulated by the establishment of fairs at F\u0101l\u0101k\u0101t\u0101 and Alipur. The chief exports to Bhutan are European piece-goods and silk, while timber and oranges are the principal imports. The local supply of rice being insufficient, considerable quantities are imported from Dinajpur; cotton piece-goods, machinery, corrugated iron, kerosene oil, coal and coke are also imported on a large scale. The tea, tobacco, and jute crops are all grown for export. The tea and jute are railed to Calcutta; the tobacco trade is chiefly in the hands of Arakanese who export the leaves to Burma, where they are made into cheroots. The railways have now monopolized most of the trade; but s\u0101l timber is floated down from the forests of the Western Du\u0101rs and the Baikuntpur jungle to the Brahmaputra en route for Sirajganj, Dacca, and elsewhere; and tobacco, mustard seed, jute, cotton, and hides are also exported by water to these markets, the chief centre being Baura. The up-stream traffic is practically confined to the importation of earthen cooking utensils, coco-nuts, molasses, small quantities of d\u0101l (Arabica revalenta), and miscellaneous articles from Dacca and Faridpur. Apart from the large tea-garden markets and the fair of Jalp\u0113s, the principal trading centres are Jalpaiguri Town, Tit\u0101lya on the Mah\u0101nand\u0101 where the great north road enters the District, Rajnagar, Saldanga, Debiganj on the Karatoy\u0101, Baura, Jorpokri, Maynaguri, Falakata, Alipur, and Buxa.\n\nThe District is well served by railways. The western portion is traversed from south to north by the Eastern Bengal State Railway, which has its northern terminus just over the Darjeeling border at Siliguri. The Bengal-Du\u0101rs Railway leaves the P\u0101rvatipur-Dhubri branch of the Eastern Bengal State Railway at L\u0101lmanir H\u0101t, and runs north-west through P\u0101tgram to Barnes Gh\u0101t, on the east bank of the Tista opposite Jalpaiguri town, where a ferry connects with the\nEastern Bengal State Railway; at M\u0101l B\u0101z\u0101r it bifurcates, one branch running west through D\u0101m-Dim to B\u0101gr\u0101kot, and another east to M\u0101d\u0101ri H\u0101t. In the east the Cooch Beh\u0101r State Railway enters the District at Alipur and runs north to Jaint\u012b.\n\nThe District contains 877 miles of road, of which 106 miles are maintained by the Public Works department and the remainder by the District board. Of the latter, 24 miles are metalled and 747 miles are unmetalled. There are also 10 miles of village tracks. In spite of the improvement and increase in the number of roads during recent years, there is still a great deficiency in some parts of the Du\u0101rs east of the Jaldh\u0101k\u0101 river, in which it is extremely difficult to maintain good roads owing to the heavy rainfall and the rapid growth of jungle. The principal routes are those which connect Jalpaiguri town with Siliguri, with the northern border via D\u0101m-Dim, with a ferry on the Sankos river, and with Alipur. The last-mentioned road is in very good order, being well raised and bridged, except at the larger rivers, which have ferries. The central emigration road, which runs east from Din\u0101jpur through Jalpaiguri District as far as Haldib\u0101ri station and thence through the Cooch Beh\u0101r State, is an important feeder to the Eastern Bengal State Railway. The board also maintains several important Provincial roads, including the Ganges-Darjeeling road, which runs for 16 miles along the north-western border of the District from Tit\u0101lya to Siliguri, the branch-road from Tit\u0101lya to Jalpaiguri, and the road from Jalpaiguri to Patgr\u0101m. There are 80 ferries, which, with six unimportant exceptions, belong to the District board, and bring in an annual revenue of Rs. 18,000; the most important are those over the Tista and Jaldh\u0101k\u0101 rivers. Of late years there has been a considerable decrease in the number of ferries, owing to the opening of the Bengal-Du\u0101rs Railway and to the bridging of sixteen streams which formerly required ferries.\n\nFor general administrative purposes the District is divided into two subdivisions, Jalpaiguri and Alipur. The former is immediately under the Deputy-Commissioner; he is assisted by five Deputy-Magistrate-Collectors, of whom two are employed exclusively on revenue work. The Alipur subdivision is in the charge of a European Deputy-Magistrate-Collector. The Mayn\u0101guri, F\u0101l\u0101k\u0101ta, and Alipur circles in the settled tracts of the Du\u0101rs are in charge of three Sub-Deputy-Collectors. Two Forest officers manage the Jalpaiguri and Buxa divisions, and an extra assistant Conservator is attached to the former division.\n\nJalpaiguri forms, with Rangpur, the charge of a single District and Sessions Judge, and the Sub-Judge of Din\u0101jpur is an additional Sub-Judge in this District. The other civil courts are those of two Munsifs at Jalpaiguri town and of the subdivisional officer of Alipur, who is\nvested with the powers of a Munsif within his subdivision. The Deputy-Commissioner has special additional powers under section 34 of the Criminal Procedure Code. Subordinate to him are three Deputy-Magistrates at head-quarters, the subdivisional officer of Alipur, and three benches of honorary magistrates, who sit at Jalpaiguri, Bod\u0101, and Debiganj. As in other parts of Eastern Bengal, cases due to disputes about land are common, and dacoities are not infrequent.\n\nP\u0101tgr\u0101m, Bod\u0101, and the Baikuntpur estate were permanently settled in 1793 as part of the province of Rangpur. The Western Du\u0101rs have been settled temporarily from time to time, the last settlement having been concluded in 1895. The current demand for land revenue in 1903-4 was 7\u00b753 lakhs, of which Rs. 1,37,000 was payable by 82 permanently settled estates, Rs. 1,97,000 by 205 temporarily settled estates, and the remainder by 5 estates managed direct by Government. In the permanently settled portion of the District rents vary from Rs. 1\u20139 an acre, which is paid for cultivable waste, and Rs. 1\u201315 for once-cropped land, up to Rs. 9\u20132 for the best jute, rice, and homestead lands. In special cases higher rates are charged, Rs. 15 being sometimes paid for bamboo land and Rs. 24\u20134 for betel-leaf gardens or areca groves. In the Du\u0101rs, where Government is the immediate landlord, rates rule considerably lower: namely, 3 annas for waste, from Rs. 1\u20132 to Rs. 1\u20136 for high land, from Rs. 1\u20136 to Rs. 2 for low land, according to the situation with reference to markets and roads, and Rs. 3 for homestead land. In the Du\u0101rs about half the area has been let out by the jotd\u0101rs, or tenants holding immediately under Government, to chuk\u0101nid\u0101rs, or sub-tenants, whose holdings have been recognized as permanent.\n\nThe following table shows the collections of land revenue and total revenue (principal heads only), in thousands of rupees:\n\n|                | 1880-1 | 1890-1 | 1900-1 | 1903-4 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Land revenue   | 3.62   | 4.23   | 7.93   | 7.46   |\n| Total revenue  | 5.37   | 7.54   | 12.43  | 13.49  |\n\nOutside Jalpaiguri municipality and Buxa cantonment, local affairs are managed by the District board, in subordination to which a local board has recently been constituted at Alipur. In 1903-4 the income of the District board was Rs. 1,35,000, of which Rs. 69,000 was obtained from rates; and the expenditure was Rs. 1,21,000, including Rs. 84,000 spent on public works.\n\nThe District contains 11 th\u0101nas or police stations and 10 outposts. The force subordinate to the District Superintendent consists of 2 inspectors, 25 sub-inspectors, 29 head constables, and 287 constables, besides a rural police of 1,467 village watchmen, grouped in circles\nunder 78 head watchmen. The District jail at Jalpaiguri town has accommodation for 122, and a subsidiary jail at Alipur for 22 prisoners.\n\nOwing partly to the sparse population and the absence of regular village sites, education is very backward, and the proportion of persons able to read and write in 1901 was only 3.9 per cent. (7 males and 0.4 females). Considerable progress has, however, been made. The total number of pupils under instruction increased from 3,582 in 1882 to 7,623 in 1892-3 and to 12,033 in 1900-1, while 13,013 boys and 935 girls were at school in 1903-4, being respectively 20.5 and 1.7 per cent. of those of school-going age. The number of educational institutions, public and private, in that year was 563, including 15 secondary and 528 primary schools. The expenditure on education was Rs. 67,000, of which Rs. 13,000 was met from Provincial funds, Rs. 20,000 from District funds, Rs. 750 from municipal funds, and Rs. 22,000 from fees. The figures include one small school for aboriginal tribes at Buxa.\n\nIn 1903 the District contained 8 dispensaries, of which 4 had accommodation for 30 in-patients. At these the cases of 38,000 out-patients and 480 in-patients were treated during the year, and 840 operations were performed. The expenditure was Rs. 12,000, of which Rs. 4,000 was met from Government contributions, Rs. 3,000 from Local and Rs. 1,600 from municipal funds, and Rs. 3,000 from subscriptions.\n\nVaccination is compulsory only in Jalpaiguri municipality. In 1903-4 the number of successful vaccinations was 25,000, representing 32 per 1,000 of the population. There is less opposition to infant vaccination than in most parts of East and North Bengal.\n\n[Martin, Eastern India, vol. iii (1838); Sir W. W.

The population was 668,027 in 1901, compared with 608,289 in 1891. It contains one town, Jalpaiguri (population, 9,708), its head-quarters, and 588 villages, and has a density of 367 persons per square mile, or more than three times that of the Alipur subdivision. The general aspect of the subdivision is that of an extensive plain, undiversified by hills or any large sheet of water, but containing extensive forests. The country is level and open, and is watered by several large rivers, including the Tista and Jaldhaka. It comprises two totally distinct tracts. The Maynaguri and D\u00e2m-Dim th\u00e2nas and the Dhupgari outpost, which form part of the Western Duars acquired from Bhutan in 1865, are rapidly increasing in population and prosperity on account\nof the expansion of the tea industry; while the population of the western th\u0101nas, which are permanently settled and originally formed part of Rangpur, is declining. There are interesting ruins at Bhitar-garh and Jalpes. The chief centres of commerce are Jalpaiguri town, Tit\u0101lya, Baura, and Mayn\u0101guri.\n\n**Jalpaiguri Town.**\u2014Head-quarters of Jalpaiguri District, Eastern Bengal and Assam, situated in $26^\\circ 32' N.$ and $88^\\circ 43' E.$, on the right bank of the Tista. Population (1901), 9,708. The town, though small, is progressive, and is the chief distributing centre in the District. It is served by the Eastern Bengal State Railway, while Barnes Gh\u0101t on the east bank of the Tista, opposite to the town, is a station on the Bengal-Du\u0101rs Railway, and the smaller marts and the tea gardens are supplied by its traders. Jalpaiguri was constituted a municipality in 1885. The income during the decade ending 1901\u20132 averaged Rs. 20,000, and the expenditure Rs. 18,000. In 1903\u20134 the income was Rs. 30,000, including Rs. 9,000 obtained from a tax on persons (or property tax) and Rs. 7,000 from a conservancy rate; and the expenditure was Rs. 25,000. Rs. 24,000 has been spent on a drainage scheme, for which an estimate of Rs. 30,000 has been sanctioned by Government. Jalpaiguri is the head-quarters of the Commissioner of the R\u0101jsh\u0101hi Division, an Inspector of schools, an Executive Engineer, and of the Deputy-Conservators of Forests in charge of the Buxa and Jalpaiguri divisions; it is also the head-quarters of a detachment of the Northern Bengal Mounted Rifles. The town contains the usual public offices. The District jail has accommodation for 122 prisoners, who are employed in oil-pressing, twine and rope-weaving, stone-breaking, cane-work, and d\u0101l and rice-husking, the products being disposed of locally. The chief educational institution is a high school maintained by Government, with 270 pupils on its rolls.\n\n**Jalpes.**\u2014Village in the head-quarters subdivision of Jalpaiguri District, Eastern Bengal and Assam, situated in $26^\\circ 31' N.$ and $88^\\circ 52' E.$ Population (1901), 2,088. It contains a temple of Siva, which was built on the site of an earlier temple by one of the Cooch Beh\u0101r R\u0101j\u0101s about three centuries ago. This, the most conspicuous ruin in the District, is a massive red-brick building, surmounted by a large dome with an outer diameter of 34 feet, round the base and top of which run galleries; it stands on a mound surrounded by a moat near the bank of the river Jarda. A flight of steps leads down to the basement, which is sunk some depth in the mound and contains a very ancient lingam. This lingam is in the hymns to Siva called an\u0101di ('without beginning'), and is referred to in the K\u0101lika Pur\u0101\u1e47a, which says that somewhere in the north-west of K\u0101mar\u016bpa Mah\u0101deo appeared himself in the shape of a vast lingam. An old-established fair is held at Jalpes on the occasion of the Sivar\u0101tr\u012b festival in February; it lasts\nfor about a fortnight and is attended by the people from all parts of the District as well as from Dinajpur, Rangpur, and elsewhere. Bhoti\u0101s come from Darjeeling, Buxa, and Bhutan with ponics, skins, cloth, and blankets, and take away cotton and woollen cloths, betel-nut, and tobacco.\n\n[Martin, Eastern India, vol. iii, pp. 441-2.]\n\nJam\u0101lab\u0101d.\u2014A precipitous rock rising to a height of 1,788 feet at the end of a spur of the Kudremukh in the Uppinangadi taluk of South Kanara District, Madras, situated in 13\u00b0 2' N. and 75\u00b0 18' E. On his return from Mangalore in 1784, Tipu, struck with the strength of the position, built and garrisoned a fortress on the top, calling it Jam\u0101lab\u0101d in honour of his mother Jam\u0101l Bai, and made the town at the foot the residence of an official. The fort was captured by the British in 1799, but shortly afterwards fell into the hands of the adherents of a Mysore pretender. The garrison, however, was forced to surrender after a three months' blockade in June, 1800. The town, formerly known as Narasimhangadi, no longer exists.\n\nJam\u0101lpur Subdivision.\u2014North-western subdivision of Mymensingh District, Eastern Bengal and Assam, lying between 24\u00b0 43' and 25\u00b0 26' N. and 89\u00b0 36' and 90\u00b0 18' E., with an area of 1,289 square miles. The subdivision is an alluvial tract, intersected by numerous rivers and streams. The population in 1901 was 673,398, compared with 579,742 in 1891. It contains two towns, Jam\u0101lpur (population, 17,965), the head-quarters, and Sherpur (12,535); and 1,747 villages. The density is 522 persons per square mile, against 618 for the whole District. The ruins of an old mud fort, said to have been built by an independent Muhammadan chief, are still in existence at Garh Jarip\u0101.\n\nJam\u0101lpur Town (1).\u2014Head-quarters of the subdivision of the same name in Mymensingh District, Eastern Bengal and Assam, situated in 24\u00b0 56' N. and 89\u00b0 56' E., on the west bank of the old Brahmaputra. Population (1901), 17,965. It is connected with Nasirabad, 35 miles distant, by a good road and also by the Dacca-Mymensingh branch of the Eastern Bengal State Railway, which has recently been extended to the Brahmaputra at Jagannathganj. Jam\u0101lpur was constituted a municipality in 1869. The income during the decade ending 1901-2 averaged Rs. 11,700, and the expenditure Rs. 10,300. In 1903-4 the income was Rs. 12,000, mainly derived from a property tax and a conservancy rate; and the expenditure was Rs. 11,000. Jam\u0101lpur was a military station prior to the Mutiny. The town possesses the usual public buildings. The sub-jail, which was once the magazine, is a specimen of the solid masonry of an early period; it has accommodation for 27 prisoners.\n\nJam\u0101lpur Town (2).\u2014Town in the head-quarters subdivision of\nMonghyr District, Bengal, situated in $25^\\circ 19' N.$ and $86^\\circ 30' E.$, at the foot of the Monghyr hills, on the loop-line of the East Indian Railway, 299 miles from Calcutta. The population at the Census of March, 1901, was 13,929, compared with 18,089 in 1891; but a second enumeration eight months later disclosed a population of 16,302. The decrease on the first occasion was chiefly due to many persons having left the town on account of the plague; but subsidiary causes were the transfer of the audit department of the East Indian Railway to Calcutta and the introduction of workmen's trains from the neighbouring stations, owing to which many of the workmen have settled outside the town. Jam\u0101lpur is the head-quarters of the locomotive department of the East Indian Railway, and contains the largest manufacturing workshops in India. Locomotives are put together, and railway material of all descriptions is made in malleable iron, cast-iron, and steel. The works cover an area of 99 acres, and employ about 230 Europeans and 9,000 native mechanics and labourers. Jam\u0101lpur was constituted a municipality in 1883. The income and expenditure during the decade ending 1901\u20132 averaged Rs. 20,000. In 1903\u20134 the income was Rs. 25,000, mainly derived from a tax on houses and lands and a conservancy rate; and the expenditure was Rs. 22,000. There is no municipal water-supply, but the workshops obtain a supply from reservoirs constructed at the base of the hills. Jam\u0101lpur contains an Institute, comprising a library, reading and billiard-rooms, an entertainment hall, and swimming bath; also a church and aided schools for Europeans and natives.\n\nJamar.\u2014Petty State in K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r, Bombay.\n\nJambusar T\u0101luka.\u2014Northern t\u0101luka of Broach District, Bombay, lying between $21^\\circ 54' N.$ and $22^\\circ 15' N.$ and $72^\\circ 31' E.$ and $72^\\circ 56' E.$, with an area of 387 square miles. The population in 1901 was 61,846, compared with 82,396 in 1891. The density, 160 persons per square mile, is below the District average. The t\u0101luka contains one town, JAMBUSAR (population, 10,181), its head-quarters; and 81 villages. The land revenue and cesses in 1903\u20134 amounted to 5\u00b73 lakhs. The country consists of two tracts of level land. Towards the west lies a barren plain, and in the east is a well-wooded stretch of light soil. In the latter tract are large and sweet springs, but in the former the water-supply is defective. The staple crops are jow\u0101r, b\u0101jra, and wheat; while miscellaneous crops include pulses, peas, tobacco, cotton, and indigo.\n\nJambusar Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the t\u0101luka of the same name in Broach District, Bombay, situated in $22^\\circ 3' N.$ and $72^\\circ 48' E.$, 5 miles north of the Dh\u0101dhar river, and 27 miles from Broach city. Population (1901), 10,181. The town was first occupied by the British in 1775 and remained in their possession until 1783, when it was restored\nto the Mar\u0101th\u0101s. Under the Treaty of Poona (1817) it was finally surrendered to the British. To the north of the town is a lake of considerable size sacred to N\u0101geshwar, the snake-god, with richly wooded banks, and in the centre of the water rises a small island about 40 feet in diameter, overgrown with mango and other trees. The water-supply is chiefly derived from this tank. In the town is a strong fort, erected by Mr. Callender when Jambusar was held by the British from 1775 to 1783. This fort furnishes accommodation for the treasury, the civil courts, and other Government offices. The town contains a Sub-Judge's court, a dispensary, and 7 schools\u20146 (including an English school) for boys and one for girls\u2014attended respectively by 553 and 106 pupils.\n\nThe municipality, established in 1856, had an average income of about Rs. 12,000 during the decade ending 1901. In 1903-4 the income was Rs. 13,900, including grants of Rs. 2,000 from Government for education. In former times, when Tank\u0101ri, 10 miles south-west of Jambusar, was a port of little less consequence than Broach, Jambusar itself enjoyed a considerable trade. Indigo was then the chief export. With the opening of a railway (1861), the traffic by sea at Tank\u0101ri fell off considerably. On the other hand, Jambusar is only 18 miles distant from the P\u0101lej station on the Bombay, Baroda, and Central India Railway; and, as roads have been made connecting Jambusar with both P\u0101lej and Broach, a traffic by land has to some extent taken the place of the old sea-borne trade. It is in contemplation to connect Broach and Jambusar by rail. There are six cotton-ginning factories. Tanning, the manufacture of leather, and calico-printing are carried on to a small extent, and there are also manufactures of ivory armlets and toys.\n\nJames\u0101b\u0101d (formerly S\u0101m\u0101ro).\u2014T\u0101luka of Thar and P\u0101rkar District, Sind, Bombay, lying between 24\u00b0 50' and 25\u00b0 28' N. and 69\u00b0 14' and 69\u00b0 35' E., with an area of 505 square miles. The population in 1901 was 24,038, compared with 19,208 in 1891. The density, 48 persons per square mile, is considerably above the District average. The t\u0101luka contains 184 villages, of which James\u0101b\u0101d is the headquarters. The land revenue and cesses in 1903-4 amounted to 3\u00b77 lakhs. The t\u0101luka is chiefly irrigated by the J\u0101mr\u0101o canal. B\u0101fra, iambho, and wheat are the principal crops.\n\nJames and Mary Sands.\u2014A dangerous shoal in the Hooghly river, Bengal, situated in 22\u00b0 14' N. and 88\u00b0 5' E., between the confluence of the D\u0101modar and R\u016bpn\u0101r\u0101yan rivers with the Hooghly. The sands are 3 miles long and a third of a mile in width. They are so named from the wreck of the ship Royal James and Mary which took place on these sands in 1694. The sands occupy the centre of the river, leaving channels on either side, known as the\nEastern and Western Gut; they are probably due to the diminution of the velocity of the current of the main channel, caused by the water of the R\u016bpn\u0101r\u0101yan entering the Hooghly nearly at right angles. Various schemes have been suggested for evading this dangerous shoal; and it has more than once been proposed to dig a short canal at the back of Hooghly Point so as to avoid the sands, or to construct ship canals from the docks to Diamond Harbour or to Canning on the M\u0101tla river. The problem was examined in 1865 and again in 1895 by experts, both of whom suggested the construction of walls to train the channel into the Western Gut. Neither proposal has been adopted by the Port Commissioners, who are at present considering another scheme to improve the existing channels by dredging.\n\nJamikunta.\u2014T\u0101luk in Karimnagar District, Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State, with an area of 626 square miles, including j\u0101g\u012brs. The population in 1901 was 121,518, compared with 134,309 in 1891, the decrease being due to famine and cholera. The t\u0101luk contains 158 villages, of which 9 are j\u0101g\u012br; and Jamikunta (population, 2,687) is the head-quarters. The land revenue in 1901 was 4 lakhs. The t\u0101luk is hilly towards the west, while isolated hills are seen everywhere. There is hardly any forest. Rice is largely cultivated, being irrigated from tanks.\n\nJam\u012br\u0101p\u0101\u1e6d.\u2014A long winding ridge about 2 miles wide in the Surguj\u0101 State, Central Provinces, lying between 23\u00b0 22' and 23\u00b0 29' N. and 83\u00b0 33' and 83\u00b0 41' E. It rises to a height of 3,500 feet and forms part of the eastern boundary of the State where it borders on Chot\u0101 Nagpur proper.\n\nJamka.\u2014Petty State in K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r, Bombay.\n\nJamkhandi State.\u2014State under the Political Agent of Kolh\u0101pur and the Southern Mar\u0101th\u0101 Country, Bombay, lying between 16\u00b0 26' and 16\u00b0 47' N. and 75\u00b0 7' and 75\u00b0 37' E., with an area of 524 square miles. The State was granted by the Peshw\u0101 to a member of the Patvardhan family. In 1808 it was divided into two shares, one of which, T\u0101sgaon, lapsed to the British Government in 1848, through failure of heirs, while the other forms the present Jamkhandi State. The population in 1901 was 105,357, the density being 201 persons per square mile. Hindus formed 87 per cent., and Muhammadans 10 per cent. of the total. The State contains 8 towns, the chief being Jamkhandi (population, 13,029), and 79 villages. A soft stone of superior quality is found near the village of Marigudi. The crops include cotton, wheat, the ordinary varieties of pulse, and millet; and the manufactures, coarse cotton cloth and native blankets for home consumption. The chief, who is a Br\u0101hman by caste, ranks as a first-class Sard\u0101r of the Southern Mar\u0101th\u0101 Country. He holds a\n\n---\n\n1 These spherical values exclude the outlying t\u012bluka of Kundgol, situated between 15\u00b0 7' and 15\u00b0 9' N. and 75\u00b0 13' and 75\u00b0 23' E.\nsanad of adoption, and succession follows the rule of primogeniture. He has power to try his own subjects for capital offences. He maintains a force of 43 horse and 214 foot soldiers; and he pays to the British Government a tribute of Rs. 20,516. The revenue in 1903-4 was nearly 5.5 lakhs, of which 4.4 lakhs was derived from the land; and the expenditure was about 5 lakhs. A survey was introduced in the State in 1881-2. The State possesses six municipalities, the largest being Jamkhandi with an income of Rs. 10,000, and the smallest Hunnur with an income of Rs. 600. In 1903-4 there were 42 schools, including an English school, and the total number of pupils was 1,588. The State has a Central jail and 4 subordinate jails, with a daily average of 36 prisoners in 1903-4; and one hospital and three dispensaries, which treated 38,100 patients. In the same year about 2,300 persons were vaccinated.\n\nJamkhandi Town.\u2014Capital of the State of the same name in Bombay, situated in 16\u00b0 30' N. and 75\u00b0 22' E., 70 miles north-east of Belgaum, and 68 miles east of Kolhapur. Population (1901), 13,029. Jamkhandi is a municipality, with an income in 1903-4 of about Rs. 10,000. The town has about 500 looms and an extensive trade in silk cloths. It contains a high school and a hospital. An annual fair is held in honour of the god Um\u0101 R\u0101meshwar, lasting for six days and attended by 20,000 people.\n\nJ\u0101mkhed.\u2014T\u0101luka of Ahmadnagar District, Bombay, in the south-east corner of the District, surrounded by the Niz\u0101m's Dominions. The largest compact portion lies between 18\u00b0 33' and 18\u00b0 52' N. and 75\u00b0 11' and 75\u00b0 35' E. The area is 460 square miles, and the t\u0101luka contains one town, Kharda (population, 5,930), and 75 villages. The head-quarters are at J\u0101mkhed. The population in 1901 was 64,258, compared with 76,208 in 1891, the decrease being due to famine. The density, 140 persons per square mile, is above the District average. The demand for land revenue in 1903-4 was one lakh, and for cesses Rs. 7,000. Most of the villages are situated in the valley of the Sina, and a few on the B\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t, an elevated and bare table-land, which gradually subsides eastward to the general level of the Deccan and is watered by a tributary of the God\u0101v\u0101ri. Several streams rise in the small spurs which jut from the B\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t range, the most notable being the Inch\u0101na, which falls in a fine cascade, 219 feet high, through a ravine to the north-east of J\u0101mkhed village. Whereas the soil of the Sina valley is deep and difficult to work, that of the B\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t is of lighter texture and repays cultivation; while the country lying between this range and the boundary of Shevgaon is extremely fertile and well-watered, except in the vicinity of the Sina river, where the rainfall is uncertain. The climate of J\u0101mkhed is healthy, and the annual rainfall averages about 26 inches.\nJamki.\u2014Town in the Daska tahsil of Si\u0101lkot District, Punjab, situated in $32^\\circ 23' N.$ and $74^\\circ 24' E.$ Population (1901), 4,216. It is said to have been originally called Pindi J\u0101m from its joint founders, Pindi, a Khattri, and J\u0101m, a Ch\u012bma Jat. It is of no commercial importance. The municipality was created in 1867. The income during the ten years ending 1902\u20133 averaged Rs. 5,200, and the expenditure Rs. 5,100. In 1903\u20134 the income was Rs. 5,300, chiefly from octroi; and the expenditure was Rs. 5,700. An Anglo-vernacular middle school is maintained by the municipality.\n\nJammalamadugu Subdivision.\u2014Subdivision of Cuddapah District, Madras, consisting of the Jammalamadugu, Proddat\u016br, and Pulivendla taluks.\n\nJammalamadugu Taluk (Jambulu-madugu, \u2018the pool of rushes\u2019).\u2014North-western taluk of Cuddapah District, Madras, lying between $14^\\circ 37'$ and $15^\\circ 5' N.$ and $78^\\circ 4'$ and $78^\\circ 30' E.$, with an area of 616 square miles. The population in 1901 was 103,707, compared with 101,296 in 1891. The density is 168 persons per square mile, the District average being 148. The taluk contains one town, Jammalamadugu (population, 13,852), the head-quarters; and 129 villages. The demand for land revenue and cesses in 1903\u20134 amounted to Rs. 2,72,000. The annual rainfall averages 22 inches, compared with 28 in the District as a whole, and is less than in any other taluk.\n\nTwo small hill ranges run from east to west through the southern portion of Jammalamadugu, both of which are parts of the Erramalas (Errakondas) or \u2018red hills.\u2019 One of them divides the taluk from Pulivendla; and the other, which lies parallel to it, reaches its highest point at the fine gorge where the Penner bends sharply to the north and flows by Gandikota to the town of Jammalamadugu. The Penner and Chitr\u0101vati rivers join near Gandl\u016br on the west of the taluk, and their united channel drains the greater portion of the country. In the precipitous gorge of Gandikota, the river is reduced to an average width of 200 yards; but in the level plain near the chief town it is at least three times as broad. Its waters are utilized to some slight extent for irrigation channels, but the manner in which the land rises from the river banks prevents any great use being made of them. Except the Penner basin, the whole of the taluk may be included in the black cotton soil tract. The quality of the land varies considerably, being excellent in the north and west, but only mediocre in the south. The wide plains of black soil are almost entirely divided between the two crops of cholam and cotton. Indigo, gram, and oilseeds are also raised; but water is so scarce that rice and r\u0101gi may be said to be confined to the immediate neighbourhood of the Penner and its channels. The taluk has been liable from time to time to inundations. In 1851 the village of Chautapalle, at the confluence of the Penner and\nthe Chitr\u0101vati, was totally destroyed by flood. Enormous freshes came down both rivers simultaneously and carried away the whole place, drowning about 500 of its inhabitants. On the morning of September 12, 1902, a sudden deluge of rain swept away two spans of the railway bridge near the Mangapatnam railway station, with the result that the mail train was precipitated into the gap and seventy-one lives were lost. The Kurnool-Cuddapah Canal touches the north-east corner of the t\u0101luk.\n\nJammalamadugu Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the subdivision and t\u0101luk of the same name in Cuddapah District, Madras, situated in $14^\\circ 51' \\text{ N.}$ and $78^\\circ 14' \\text{ E.}$, on the left bank of the Penner river. Population (1901), 13,852. It is a busy centre of trade, with large exports of indigo and cotton. Cloths are also manufactured on hand-looms. The car-festival of Narapurasw\u0101mi, held in May, continues for ten days and is attended by many people from surrounding villages. The place is a station of the London Missionary Society, which possesses a fine hospital, and also of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel.\n\nJammu Province.\u2014Province in Kashmir State. See Kashmir and Jammu State.\n\nJammu Town.\u2014Capital of the Jammu province, Kashmir State, and the winter head-quarters of the Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101, situated in $32^\\circ 44' \\text{ N.}$ and $74^\\circ 55' \\text{ E.}$, at an elevation of 1,200 feet above sea-level. Population (1901), 36,130. It lies high on the right bank of the river T\u0101wi, which flows in a narrow ravine to join the Chen\u0101b. The town covers a space of about one square mile, densely packed with single-storeyed houses of round stones and mud with flat tops. In the upper portion are superior houses of brick, and in the Mandi stand the State offices and the palaces of the Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101 and his brother. The general effect of Jammu is striking; and from a distance the whitewashed temples, with their gilded pinnacles, suggest a splendour which is dispelled on nearer acquaintance. The most conspicuous of the temples is Raghu\u1e47\u0101thji, but like all the other buildings in Jammu it is commonplace. The Dogr\u0101s have little taste in architecture, and are essentially economical and practical in their ideas of domestic comfort.\n\nThe railway, which runs to Si\u0101lkot, a distance of about 27 miles, starts from the left bank of the T\u0101wi. The river is spanned by a fine suspension bridge, and a good cart-road runs from the bridge as far as the Mandi. The other streets are narrow and irregular, and there is nothing of striking interest. Of late years the construction of waterworks, the opening of the cart-road to the Mandi, the suspension bridge over the T\u0101wi, and the railway extension from Si\u0101lkot have improved the conditions of life in Jammu; but there has been no marked response either in population or in prosperity.\nIn the palmy days of R\u0101j\u0101 Ranjit Deo, towards the latter part of the eighteenth century, it is stated that the population was 150,000. There is nothing in the geographical position of Jammu which makes for prosperity. It lies on the edge of the Mah\u0101r\u0101ja\u2019s territories, with an infertile hinterland. Rightly speaking, it should have been the emporium for Kashmir commerce, but the construction of the Koh\u0101la-Srinagar cart-road has taken trade away from the Jammu-Ban\u012bh\u0101l route. At present there are hopes of the development of coal-mines to the north, which might bring prosperity to the Dogr\u0101 capital; and the railway projected from Jammu to Srinagar would restore much business.\n\nThe town of Jammu was a considerable centre of industry in the time of the late Mah\u0101r\u0101ja of Kashmir and Jammu, Ranb\u012br Singh; but now it is merely the residence of the ruling family and of the officials of the State. The governor (H\u0101kim-i-Ala) of the province with his revenue office, the Chief Judge, the Sub-Judge and two magistrates of the first class, the Waz\u012br-i-Waz\u0101rat of the Jammu district, the Superintendent of police, Jammu province, the chief medical officer, and the heads of various departments all live in Jammu, together with the staff of their several offices. A large hall called the Ajaibghar was erected by the late Mah\u0101r\u0101ja for the accommodation of the present King-Emperor, when he visited Jammu as Prince of Wales in the year 1875. The Mandi Mub\u0101rak palaces and the palace of R\u0101j\u0101 Sir Amar Singh, situated on the R\u0101mnagar hill, towards the north of the town, are the chief attractions. The Central jail has a daily average of 268 prisoners, and costs about Rs. 20,000 per annum. The State high school is located in a large building, and is doing fairly efficient work. It contains about 800 pupils. A college to be named after the Prince of Wales is shortly to be opened. A State hospital is maintained, costing annually Rs. 14,800. Great improvements have been made in the drainage system of the town, which is managed by a municipal committee, and more improvements in this respect are under contemplation.\n\nJ\u0101mnagar.\u2014Native State and town in K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r, Bombay. See NAV\u0100NAGAR.\n\nJ\u0101mner T\u0101luka.\u2014T\u0101luka of East Kh\u0101ndesh District, Bombay, lying between 20\u00b0 33\u2032 and 20\u00b0 55\u2032 N. and 75\u00b0 32\u2032 and 76\u00b0 1\u2032 E., with an area of 527 square miles. It contains two towns, J\u0101mner (population, 6,457), the head-quarters, and Shendurni (6,423); and 155 villages. The population in 1901 was 91,739, compared with 87,230 in 1891. The average density, 174 persons per square mile, is above the District average. The demand for land revenue in 1903\u20134 was 2\u00b74 lakhs, and for cesses Rs. 17,000. Most of the t\u0101luka consists of a succession of rises and dips, with streams the banks of which are\nfringed with *babul* groves. In the north and south-east low straggling hills covered with young teak rise out of the plain. There is a plentiful and constant supply of water. On the whole, the climate is healthy, but at the close of the rains fever and ague prevail. The chief streams are the V\u0101ghur, with its tributaries the K\u0101g and Sur, the Harki and Sonij. Most of these streams rise in the S\u0101tm\u0101la hills. There are also 1,950 wells. Generally speaking, the soil is poor. There is black loam in the valleys, and on the plateaux a rich brownish mould called *k\u0101li munjal*.\n\n**J\u0101mner Town.**\u2014Head-quarters of the *t\u0101luka* of the same name in East Kh\u0101ndesh District, Bombay, situated in 20\u00b0 49\u2032 N. and 75\u00b0 47\u2032 E., on the small river K\u0101g, 60 miles east-by-south of Dhulia. Population (1901), 6,457. J\u0101mner was a place of consequence in the times of the Peshw\u0101s. Its prosperity has recently shown signs of revival, owing to its rising cotton trade and ginning industry. The town has three cotton-ginning and pressing factories, a dispensary, and two schools, attended by nearly 200 boys.\n\n**J\u0101mnia.**\u2014*Bhumi\u0101t* in the Bhop\u0101war Agency, Central India.\n\n**Jamnotr\u012b.**\u2014Temple in the State of Tehri, United Provinces, situated in 31\u00b0 1\u2032 N. and 78\u00b0 28\u2032 E. It stands on the western flank of the great peak of Bandarpunch (30,731 feet), at an elevation of about 10,800 feet above the sea and 4 miles below the glacier from which the Jumna issues. The temple is a small wooden structure, containing an image of the goddess Jumna. Close by are a number of hot springs from which water issues at a temperature of 194.7\u00b0 F. Many pilgrims visit this sacred place every summer.\n\n**J\u0101mpur Tahsil.**\u2014*Tahsil* of Dera Gh\u0101zi Kh\u0101n District, Punjab, lying between 29\u00b0 16\u2032 and 29\u00b0 46\u2032 N. and 70\u00b0 4\u2032 and 70\u00b0 43\u2032 E., with an area of 895 square miles. It is bounded by the Indus on the east, and by independent territory on the west. The riverain lowlands are subject to inundation from the Indus, and are also irrigated by inundation canals and wells. The hilly portion of the *tahsil* includes the M\u0101ri peak (5,385 feet above the sea). The rest of the *tahsil* consists of a sandy tract, the cultivation of which depends on irrigation from the Kah\u0101 torrent and on the very precarious rainfall. The population in 1901 was 97,247, compared with 83,583 in 1891. It contains the towns of J\u0101mpur (population, 5,928), the head-quarters, and Dajal (6,213); and 149 villages. Harrand is a place of some historical interest. The land revenue and cesses in 1903\u20134 amounted to 1.5 lakhs.\n\n**J\u0101mpur Town.**\u2014Head-quarters of the J\u0101mpur *tahsil* of Dera Gh\u0101zi Kh\u0101n District, Punjab, situated in 29\u00b0 39\u2032 N. and 70\u00b0 39\u2032 E., 32 miles south of Dera Gh\u0101zi Kh\u0101n town. Population (1901), 5,928. There is a considerable export of indigo to Mult\u0101n and Sukkur, and a good deal of\nlac turnery is carried on. The municipality was created in 1873. The income and expenditure during the ten years ending 1902-3 averaged Rs. 10,100 and Rs. 9,600 respectively. In 1903-4 the income was Rs. 11,500, chiefly from octroi; and the expenditure was Rs. 12,500. The town has an Anglo-veracular middle school, maintained by the municipality, and a dispensary.\n\nJ\u0101mrao Canal.\u2014A large and important water channel in the Hyder\u0101b\u0101d and the Thar and P\u0101rkar Districts of Sind, Bombay. The canal takes off from the N\u0101ra river in the north-west corner of the Sanghar t\u0101luka and joins the N\u0101ra again in the extreme south of the James\u0101b\u0101d t\u0101luka, the total length of the area irrigated being about 130 miles with an average breadth of 10 miles. The natural features vary. The upper reaches of the canal pass through the sandy jungle-clad hills along the N\u0101ra river, which give place to an alluvial plain, covered, where formerly liable to be flooded from the N\u0101ra, with thick jungle of kandi, bab\u016bl, and wild caper bushes, and are succeeded by the wide open plains sparsely dotted with vegetation which are the characteristic feature of the country. The length of the J\u0101mrao Canal is 117 miles, and, including all its branches and distributaries, 588 miles. This canal has one large branch, called the West Branch, 63 miles in length, and about 408 miles of minor channels.\n\nThe canal was opened on November 24, 1899, and water for irrigation on a large scale was admitted in the following June. The cost of the work was about 84.6 lakhs and the gross revenue of 1903-4 amounted to 62\u00bd lakhs, which gives a net revenue of 4.3 lakhs or 5.1 per cent. on capital outlay to the end of the year. The area irrigated in 1903-4 was 451 square miles. Large areas were available for colonization in the centre of the tract adjoining the canal to which water had never before penetrated, and over which no rights had been previously acquired. To these lands, colonists have recently been drawn from the Punjab, Cutch, Jodhpur, Jaisalmer, Kohist\u0101n, and the Desert. The area so far allotted to colonists, on the model of the Chen\u0101b Colony in the Punjab, amounted in 1904 to 116 square miles.\n\nJamr\u016bd.\u2014Fort and cantonment just beyond the border of Pesh\u0101war District, North-West Frontier Province, situated in 34\u00b0 6' N. and 71\u00b0 23' E., at the mouth of the Khyber Pass, 10\u00bd miles west of Pesh\u0101war. Population (1901), 1,848. Jamr\u016bd was first fortified in 1836 by Hari Singh, the Sikh governor of Pesh\u0101war. It is now the head-quarters of the Khyber Rifles, and is the collecting station for the Khyber tolls, and contains a considerable sarai. A large mobilization camping-ground has been selected, 3 miles on the Pesh\u0101war side of Jamr\u016bd, and arrangements have been made for supplying water to it from the B\u0101r\u0101 water-works. Jamr\u016bd is connected with Pesh\u0101war by a branch of the North-Western Railway.\nJamtara Subdivision.\u2014South-western subdivision of the Santal Parganas District, Bengal, lying between $23^\\circ 48'$ and $24^\\circ 10'$ N. and $86^\\circ 30'$ and $87^\\circ 18'$ E., with an area of 698 square miles. The subdivision, which is bounded on the south by the Bar\u0101kar and is intersected by the Ajay river, is a rolling country, in places rocky and covered with jungle, and resembles in its general features the adjoining District of M\u0101nbh\u016bm. The population in 1901 was 189,799, compared with 173,726 in 1891, the density being 272 persons per square mile. It contains 1,073 villages, of which J\u0101mt\u0101ra is the head-quarters; but no town.\n\nJ\u0101mt\u0101ra Village.\u2014Head-quarters of the subdivision of the same name in the Santal Parganas District, Bengal, situated in $23^\\circ 58'$ N. and $86^\\circ 50'$ E. Population (1901), 278.\n\nJamu.\u2014Province and town in Kashmir State. See Kashmir and Jammu and Jammu Town.\n\nJam\u016bi Subdivision.\u2014Southern subdivision of Monghyr District, Bengal, lying between $24^\\circ 22'$ and $25^\\circ 7'$ N. and $85^\\circ 49'$ and $86^\\circ 37'$ E., with an area of 1,276 square miles. The population in 1901 was 551,227, compared with 553,917 in 1891. At the time of the Census it comprised an area of 1,593 square miles, but the Sheikhpur\u0101 th\u0101na was subsequently transferred to the Monghyr subdivision. The population of the subdivision as now constituted is 374,998. It contains 499 villages, of which Jam\u016bi is its head-quarters. The subdivision, which in the south merges in the Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur plateau, contains large areas of jungle, and supports only 294 persons to the square mile, being the least densely populated part of the District. Jam\u016bi is an important centre of trade. Gidhaur and Khaira are the present seats of the two senior branches of the Gidhaur family.\n\nJam\u016bi Village.\u2014Head-quarters of the subdivision of the same name in Monghyr District, Bengal, situated in $24^\\circ 55'$ N. and $86^\\circ 13'$ E., on the left bank of the river Kiul, 4 miles south-west of the Jam\u016bi station on the East Indian Railway, with which it is connected by a metalled road. Population (1901), 4,744. It contains the usual public offices, a muns\u012bfi, a sub-jail with accommodation for 51 prisoners, and a higher-class English school. Mahua flowers (Bassia latifolia) and oil, ghi, shellac, oilseeds, grain, and gur are exported, and cotton, tobacco, piece-goods, and metal vessels are imported. Trade is carried on by rail and by pack-bullocks. To the south of the village are the remains of an old fort, known as Indpegarh.\n\nJamun\u0101 (1).\u2014River of Eastern Bengal and Assam, probably representing one of the old channels of the Tista. It rises in Din\u0101jpur District, not far from the boundary of Rangpur ($25^\\circ 38'$ N. and $88^\\circ 54'$ E.), and, flowing due south along the border of Bogra, finally falls into the Atrai, itself a tributary of the Ganges, near the village of Bhaw\u0101nipur.\nin R\u0101jsh\u0101hi District (24\u00b0 38' N. and 88\u00b0 57' E.), after a total length of 89 miles. In the lower part of its course the Jamun\u0101 is navigated all the year round by country boats of considerable burden, but higher up it is navigable only during the rainy season. The chief river marts on the banks of the Jamun\u0101 are Phulb\u0101ri and Bir\u0101mpur in Din\u0101jpur District, and Hilli in Bogra, just beyond the Din\u0101jpur boundary.\n\nJamun\u0101 (2).\u2014Deltaic distributary of the Ganges in Bengal, or rather the name given to a part of the waters of the Ich\u0101mat\u012b during a section of its course. The Jamun\u0101 enters the Twenty-four Parganas at B\u0101li\u0101ni from Jessore District; and after a south-easterly route through the Twenty-four Parganas and Nadi\u0101 Districts winds amid the forests and jungles of the Sundarbans, until it empties itself into the Raimangal, at a short distance from the point where the estuary debouches in the Bay of Bengal, in 21\u00b0 47' N. and 89\u00b0 13' E. The Jamun\u0101 is a deep river and navigable throughout the year by trading boats of the largest size, and its breadth varies from 150 to 300 or 400 yards. The Bh\u0101ngar line of the Calcutta and Eastern Canals strikes this river at Husain\u0101b\u0101d.\n\nJamun\u0101 (3) (or Janai).\u2014Name given to the lower section of the Brahmaputra, in Eastern Bengal and Assam, from its entrance into Bengal in 25\u00b0 24' N. and 89\u00b0 41' E., to its confluence with the Ganges in 23\u00b0 50' N. and 89\u00b0 45' E. Its course is almost due south, extending approximately for a length of 121 miles. This channel is of comparatively recent formation. When Major Rennell compiled his map of Bengal towards the close of the eighteenth century, the main stream of the Brahmaputra flowed in a south-easterly direction across the District of Mymensingh, past the civil station of Nasir\u0101b\u0101d, to join the Meghn\u0101 just below Bhairab B\u0101z\u0101r. Some thirty years later, at the time of Buchanan Hamilton\u2019s survey, this channel had already become of secondary importance; and at the present time, though it still bears the name of Brahmaputra, it has dwindled to a mere watercourse, navigable only during the rainy season. The Jamun\u0101 is now the main stream, and it extends from near Ghor\u0101m\u0101ra in Rangpur District to the river mart of Goalundo in Faridpur, situated at the junction with the main stream of the Ganges. Along the left or east bank stretches the District of Mymensingh, and on the right or west bank lie Rangpur, Bogra, and P\u0101bna, all in the R\u0101jsh\u0101hi Division. Although a modern creation, the Jamun\u0101 thus serves as an important administrative boundary. In the portion of its course which fringes Bogra District, it is locally known as the Daokob\u0101 or \u2018hatchet-cut,\u2019 perhaps to distinguish it from the Jamun\u0101 (1) in that District. It runs through a low-lying country, formed out of its own loose alluvial sands, which afford the most favourable\nsoil for jute cultivation. At some points its channel swells during the rainy season to a breadth of four or five miles, broken by frequent chars or sandbanks, which form, are washed away, and re-form year after year, according to the varying incidence of the current. The chief river mart on the Jamun\u0101 is Sirajganj in Pabna District. The Jamun\u0101 is navigable throughout its entire length, at all seasons of the year, by native craft of the largest burden, and also by the river steamers that ply to Assam.\n\nJandi\u0101la.\u2014Town in the Phillaur tahsil of Jullundur District, Punjab, situated in 31\u00b0 34' N. and 75\u00b0 37' E. Population (1901), 6,620. It ceased to be a municipality in 1872.\n\nJandi\u0101la Gur\u016b.\u2014Town in the District and tahsil of Amritsar, Punjab, situated in 31\u00b0 34' N. and 75\u00b0 2' E., on the North-Western Railway, and on the grand trunk road, 11 miles east of Amritsar city. Population (1901), 7,750. The proprietary body are Jats, but there is a large mercantile community of Bh\u0101bras, who by religion are Jains. There is a considerable manufacture of blankets and brass vessels. The municipality was created in 1867. The income during the ten years ending 1902-3 averaged Rs. 8,200, and the expenditure Rs. 8,100. In 1903-4 the income was Rs. 8,400, chiefly derived from octroi; and the expenditure was Rs. 9,800. The town possesses an Anglo-vernacular middle school, maintained by the District board, and mission hospitals for men and women.\n\nJandola (Jandula).\u2014A Bhittanni village on the right-hand bank of the T\u0101nk Z\u0101m stream, on the borders of the Mahs\u016bd territory in the Southern Wazirist\u0101n Political Agency, North-West Frontier Province, situated in 32\u00b0 20' N. and 70\u00b0 9' E. A fortified post close to the village is garrisoned by two companies of regulars and 25 cavalry, besides the Bhittanni levies.\n\nJangaon.\u2014T\u0101luk in Adil\u0101b\u0101d District, Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State, situated midway between the Sirpur and Lakhsetipet t\u0101luks and consisting of villages recently taken from those two t\u0101luks. Its head-quarters are at Jangaon (population, 2,052).\n\nJangipur Subdivision.\u2014Northern subdivision of Murshid\u0101b\u0101d District, Bengal, lying between 24\u00b0 19' and 24\u00b0 52' N. and 87\u00b0 49' and 88\u00b0 21' E., with an area of 509 square miles. The subdivision is divided into two parts by the Bh\u0101girathi, the land to the west of that river being high and undulating, and that to the east a fertile alluvial tract liable to floods. The population in 1901 was 334,191, compared with 317,179 in 1891, the density being 657 persons per square mile. It contains one town, Jangipur (population, 10,921), its head-quarters; and 1,093 villages.\n\nJangipur Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the subdivision of the same name in Murshid\u0101b\u0101d District, Bengal, situated in 24\u00b0 28' N. and\n83\u00b0 4' E., on the Bh\u0101girathi. Population (1901), 10,921. The town, which is said to have been founded by the emperor Jah\u0101ng\u012br, was during the early years of British rule an important centre of the silk trade and the site of one of the Company's Commercial Residencies. There are still extensive filatures in the neighbourhood. Situated near the mouth of the Bh\u0101girathi, it is the chief toll station for boats passing along that river. It was constituted a municipality in 1869. The income during the decade ending 1901-2 averaged Rs. 11,000, and the expenditure Rs. 10,000. In 1903-4 the income was Rs. 14,000, including Rs. 4,000 obtained from tolls and ferries, and Rs. 3,000 derived from a tax on persons (or property tax); and the expenditure was Rs. 13,000. The town with the courts and offices originally stood on the left bank of the Bh\u0101girathi; but, owing to the shifting of the river, the subdivisional offices have been moved to its right bank, that portion of the town being known as Raghun\u0101thganj. The sub-jail has accommodation for 26 prisoners.\n\nJ\u0101njg\u012br.\u2014Eastern tahsil of Bil\u0101spur District, Central Provinces, lying between 21\u00b0 37' and 22\u00b0 50' N. and 82\u00b0 19' and 83\u00b0 40' E. In 1901 its area was 1,467 square miles, and the population was 285,236. On the formation of the new Drug District, the constitution of the tahsil was considerably altered. A tract lying south of the Mah\u0101nadi, containing the Bilaigarh, Katg\u012b, and Bhatgaon zamind\u0101ris, with the Son\u0101kh\u0101n estate, and the Sarsew\u0101 group of villages, was transferred to the Balod\u0101 B\u0101z\u0101r tahsil of Raipur District, while the three northern zamind\u0101ris of Korb\u0101, Chhuri, and Upror\u0101 were transferred from the Bil\u0101spur tahsil to J\u0101njg\u012br. On the transfer of Sam-balpur District to Bengal, the Chandarpur-Padampur and M\u0101lkhurd\u0101 estates of that District were added to this tahsil. The revised figures of area and population for the J\u0101njg\u012br tahsil are 3,939 square miles and 418,209 persons. The population of this area in 1891 was 451,024. The density is 138 persons per square mile. The tahsil contains 1,331 villages. The head-quarters are at J\u0101njg\u012br, a village of 2,257 inhabitants, adjoining Nail\u0101 station on the railway, 26 miles east of Bil\u0101spur town. The tahsil has only four square miles of Government forest. It includes the zamind\u0101ri estates of Ch\u0101mpa, Korb\u0101, Chhuri, and Upror\u0101, with a total area of 1,748 square miles, of which 746 are tree and scrub forest, and a population of 112,680 persons. The land revenue demand in 1902-3 on the area now constituting the tahsil was approximately 1.42 lakhs. The old area of the tahsil is almost wholly an open plain, covered with yellow clay soil and closely cropped with rice, while the northern zamind\u0101ris consist principally of densely forested hills and plateaux.\n\nJ\u0101nji.\u2014River in Sibs\u0101gar District, Eastern Bengal and Assam. See Jhanzi.\nJanjira State (or Habs\u0101n, \u2018the African\u2019s land\u2019).\u2014State within the Political Agency of Kol\u0101ba, in the Konkan, Bombay, lying between 18\u00b0 and 18\u00b0 31\u2032 N. and 72\u00b0 53\u2032 and 73\u00b0 17\u2032 E. The State is bounded on the north by the Kundalika or Roha creek in Kol\u0101ba District; on the east by the Roha and M\u0101ngaon t\u012blukas of the same District; on the south by the B\u0101nkot creek in Ratn\u0101giri District; and on the west by the Arabian Sea. About the middle of the coast-line, 40 miles long, the R\u0101jpuri Gulf divides Janjira into two main portions, northern and southern. The area is 324 square miles, excluding J\u0101far\u0101b\u0101d in K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r, which is also subject to the chief. The name Janjira is a corruption of the Arabic jazra, \u2018an island.\u2019\n\nThe surface of the State of Janjira is covered with spurs and hill ranges, averaging about 1,000 feet in height, and generally running parallel to the arms of the sea that penetrate eastwards into the interior. The sides of the hills are thickly wooded, except where cleared for cultivation. Inland from the coast rise ranges of wooded hills. Near the mouths of the creeks belts of palm groves from 1 to 2 miles broad fringe the shore. Behind the palm groves lie salt marshes and mangrove bushes; behind these again, the rice lands of the valleys. The wealthiest and largest villages, inhabited by skilful gardeners, well-to-do fishermen, and palm-tappers, nestle in the palm-belt along the coast. Inland, the banks of the creeks are studded with hamlets, occupied by husbandmen who cultivate rice. On the hill-sides, in glens or on terraces, are the huts and scanty clearings of K\u0101thkaris and other hillmen. The slopes of the lower hills are generally rounded and passable by a pony. These slopes, except in the rains, are bare; but at most times, and particularly at high tide, the R\u0101jpuri creek affords fine views of wooded hill and winding water. In former times travel was nearly impossible during the rains; but since the accession of the present Naw\u0101b in 1883, roads have been constructed affording considerable facilities for travel even in the rainy season. On the coast the sand-bars at the mouth of every inlet but the R\u0101jpuri creek prevent ingress. Farther inland, the low rice lands become covered with deposited mud, the main streams are flooded too deeply to be forded, and overgrown forest tracts render difficult the passage from one hill range to another. None of the streams is more than 5 or 6 miles in length. The larger watercourses flow westward. During the rains they are torrents, but dwindle to mere rills at other seasons. The chief creeks and backwaters are, beginning from the north: the M\u0101ndla-Borlai, N\u0101ngdaon, Murud, R\u0101jpuri, Panchaitan or Dive-Borlai, and Srivardhan. Most of the creek entrances are rocky and dangerous. During the navigable season, September to June, they can be entered only by boats of under 1\u00bd tons burden.\nOnce over the bar, the creeks are mostly of uniform depth throughout their course. The mouth of the R\u0101jpuri creek is 45 miles south of Bombay. The creek ends at the old town of Mhasla, 14 miles south-east of Janj\u012bra town. At springs the tide rises 12 feet in the creek. There is no bar. The bottom is muddy. The least depth at low tide is $3\\frac{1}{2}$ fathoms at the entrance of the creek, and $4\\frac{1}{2}$ fathoms inside the entrance in the mid-channel. Steamers can enter, even during the rains, and lie in still water to the south of Janj\u012bra island.\n\nThe rock is almost all trap, with, on the higher hill slopes, laterite or ironstone in large boulders. The hills are well wooded, teak being plentiful in the north. Tigers, leopards, hog, and wild cats are found in some parts. Venomous snakes are numerous.\n\nThe climate is moist and relaxing, but not unhealthy. The sea-breeze cools the coast and hill-tops. Along the coast, fever and dysentery prevail from October to January. The heat on the coast ranges from $63^\\circ$ to $85^\\circ$ in January, from $70^\\circ$ to $94^\\circ$ in May, from $79^\\circ$ to $85^\\circ$ in July, and from $69^\\circ$ to $84^\\circ$ in November. Inland, where the sea-breeze does not penetrate, the thermometer ranges $7^\\circ$ or $8^\\circ$ higher. The annual rainfall averages 107 inches.\n\nThe origin of the ruling family is thus related. About the year 1489 an Abyssinian in the service of one of the Niz\u0101m Sh\u0101hi kings of Ahmadnagar, disguised as a merchant, obtained permission from R\u0101m P\u0101tel, the Koli captain, to land 300 boxes. Each of these boxes contained a soldier, and by this means the Abyssinians possessed themselves of Janj\u012bra island and the fort of Danda R\u0101jpuri. The island afterwards formed part of the dominions of the king of Bij\u0101pur. In the time of Sivaji the government of the Southern Konkan was held by the admiral of the Bij\u0101pur fleet, who was always an Abyssinian. In consequence of the inability of his master to succour him when attacked by Sivaji, the Sidi admiral offered his services, in 1670, to the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb. The most noticeable point in the history of Janj\u012bra is its successful resistance alone of all the States of Western India to the determined attacks of the Mar\u0101th\u0101s, who made its capture a point of honour. After repeated attacks by Sivaji, its conquest was again attempted in 1682 by his son Sambh\u0101ji, who besieged the island, which he attempted to connect with the mainland by means of a mole. The project failed, and other attempted modes of attack were defeated with heavy loss. In 1733 the combined efforts of the Peshw\u0101 and Angria made little impression on Janj\u012bra. The British, on succeeding the Mar\u0101th\u0101s as masters of the Konkan, refrained from interfering in the internal administration of the State.\n\nThe chief is a Sunn\u012b Muhammadan, by race a Sidi or Abyssinian,\nwith the title of Naw\u0101b. He has a sanad guaranteeing succession according to Muhammadan law, and pays no tribute. As regards succession, the family does not necessarily follow the rule of primogeniture. Till 1868 the State enjoyed singular independence, there being no Political Agent, and no interference whatever in its internal affairs. About that year the maladministration of the chief, especially in matters of police and criminal justice, became flagrant; those branches of administration were in consequence taken out of his hands and vested in a Political Agent. The treaty which regulates the dealings of the British Government with the State is that of 1870. The Naw\u0101b of Janjira is entitled to a salute of 11 guns.\n\nThe population (exclusive of J\u0101far\u0101b\u0101d) at the last four enumerations was: (1872) 71,996, (1881) 76,361, (1891) 81,780, and (1901) 85,414. There are two towns, Murud (population, 3,553) and Sr\u012bvardhan (5,961); and 284 villages. The density is 264 persons per square mile. About 82 per cent. are Hindus and 17 per cent. Musalm\u0101ns. The castes of numerical importance are Agris (9,617), Kolis (7,326), Kunbis (15,670), and Mah\u0101rs (7,242). Br\u0101hmans (1,524) and Prabh\u016bs (1,771) constitute the higher castes. The Musalm\u0101ns are chiefly Shaikhs (13,552), only 240 having returned themselves as Sidis in 1901. An interesting though numerically unimportant community are the Bani-Israil (566), who are a race of Jewish descent, worship one God, and have no images in their houses. They practise many Jewish rites. The dress and manner of living of the Bani-Israil, who are mostly oil-pressers by trade, are partly Muhammadan and partly Hindu. They speak Mar\u0101thi. Though fond of drink, they are steady, enterprising, and prosperous. The Sidis are the representatives of Habshi or Abyssinian slaves and soldiers of fortune, and are only found in the island of Janjira. Many of them are related to the Naw\u0101b and inherit State grants and allowances. The term Sidi is considered to be a corruption of Saiyid. The crews of the Bombay harbour boats, the steamships of the Peninsular and Oriental Company, and the smaller coasting steamers, are to a great extent recruited from Janjira.\n\nExcept the plots of rich alluvial rice land in the valleys and some sandy tracts near the coast, the usual red stony soil of the Konkan prevails throughout Janjira. Of the whole area, 42 square miles or 13 per cent. are arable, of which 41 square miles were cultivated in 1903\u20134. The principal crops are rice (38\u00bd square miles), betel-nuts, and coco-nuts. Sr\u012bvardhan betel-nuts are known throughout the Bombay Presidency. In the strip of light sand bordering the coast coco-nut palms grow in great\n\n---\n\n1 The Census of 1901 showed 234 villages. The present figure is based upon more recent information.\nperfection. For irrigation purposes, water sufficiently fresh is found everywhere by digging a few feet into the easily worked earth. It is drawn from wells by means of the Persian wheel, and from streams by a balance lift called ukti. In 1878 the British system of forest preservation was adopted. The forests are now strictly protected, and in 1903\u20134 yielded Rs. 40,700. Quarries of trap and laterite are occasionally worked. Small pearls are found in oysters fished up from the Rajpuri creek. The oyster is believed to be the Placuna placenta. Judging from the quantities of shells thrown up along the banks of the Rajpuri creek, the beds must be considerable.\n\nNext to agriculture, which supports 70 per cent. of the total population, sea-fishing is the occupation of most of the people. The manufac-\n\nTrade and communications. tures include the weaving of saris, coarse cloth, turbans, and the making of coir rope, metal-work, furniture, stone-ware, and native shoes of an inferior kind. The chief articles of import are grain (Rs. 60,000), cotton and woollen stuffs (Rs. 70,000), sugar and molasses (Rs. 56,000), salt (Rs. 10,000), gh\u012b and oil (Rs. 77,000); the total value of imports being 4.3 lakhs. The export trade amounts to more than 3 lakhs, the chief articles being firewood (Rs. 83,000), supplied to Bombay, and betel-nuts and coco-nuts (Rs. 63,000). External traffic is carried on almost entirely by water. In March, 1874, a regular steam communication was established between Bombay and D\u0101sgaon on the S\u0101vitra river, touching at Janjira and Srivardhan. There are twelve ferries in the State. A ferry steamer plies between Bombay and Dharamtar. The chief made roads are from Murud to Borlai, 14 miles in length, and from Dighi to Srivardhan, 19 miles. A State post formerly worked between Alib\u0101g and B\u0101nkot, but was abolished in 1880 when the British post office extended.\n\nSince 1872, when the crops partially failed, the State has suffered from bad seasons in 1875, 1878, 1879, and 1881.\n\nFamine. In 1899\u20131900 the crops in several villages failed on account of the scanty rainfall, and relief works were undertaken.\n\nThe administration of the State is in the hands of the K\u0101rbh\u0101ri, under the orders of the Naw\u0101b and subject to the supervision of the Political Agent. There are ten criminal courts (excluding three in the J\u0101far\u0101b\u0101d dependency), with subordinate magisterial powers, and three civil courts in the State, two of which exercise appellate powers. The three civil courts are those of the Munsif, the Sar Ny\u0101y\u0101dhish, and the Sadr Court. The Munsif disposes of suits up to the value of Rs. 5,000. The Sar Ny\u0101y\u0101dhish hears suits of greater value, exercises Small Cause Court powers up to a limit of Rs. 50, and also has appellate powers. The Sadr Court, which is presided over by the Naw\u0101b himself, exercises the powers of a High\nCourt. The K\u0101rbh\u0101r\u012b has the powers of a Sessions Judge and District Magistrate.\n\nThe revenue of the State exceeds $5\\frac{1}{2}$ lakhs (inclusive of about Rs. 65,000 from J\u0101far\u0101b\u0101d in K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r), and is chiefly derived from land ($2\\frac{1}{2}$ lakhs), forests (Rs. 41,000), excise (Rs. 70,000), and salt and customs (Rs. 50,000). The expenditure is 5 lakhs (inclusive of Rs. 41,000 in J\u0101far\u0101b\u0101d), of which one lakh is brought to account as Darb\u0101r expenses and Rs. 50,000 as in\u0101m and charities or religious grants. Salt is purchased from the British Government, the annual sale of which amounts to 9,000 maunds. Opium is also purchased from the British Government. The excise system is the same as in the Alib\u0101g taluka of Kol\u0101ba District. Of the total excise revenue, the tree taxes yield Rs. 34,000 and the toddy spirit fee Rs. 20,000. Till it was closed in 1834, the Naw\u0101b\u2019s mint issued silver and copper coins. British coinage has now taken the place of the old currency. The total number of villages (including towns) is 286, of which 263 are unalienated and 23 alienated. The chief district revenue officer is in charge of the three fiscal divisions or mah\u0101ls of Srivardhan, Murud, and Mhasla. The survey settlement was introduced in 1898\u20139. The new rates have enhanced the assessment from 1.81 to 1.86 lakhs. The present rates for rice land vary from Rs. 6\u20137 to Rs. 9\u20139 per acre; for garden land from Rs. 6\u201310 to Rs. 15\u201311; and for varkas land from 3 to 4 annas.\n\nThere are two municipalities, besides that at J\u0101far\u0101b\u0101d, one at Murud and the other at Srivardhan, with an income in 1903\u20134 of Rs. 3,600 and Rs. 3,200 respectively. Local funds yield Rs. 15,000, consisting of a cess of one anna on each rupee of land revenue and part of the income from cattle pounds. Exclusive of 13 irregulars in J\u0101far\u0101b\u0101d, the military force consists of 30 infantry, 14 gunners, and 188 irregulars, in all 232. The total strength of the permanent police is 137, exclusive of 28 in J\u0101far\u0101b\u0101d. The daily average number of prisoners in the State jail in 1903\u20134 was 11. There are also 3 lock-ups. Janjira proper has (1903\u20134) 69 schools, including one English school with 130 pupils. The number of pupils attending these schools was 2,862, of whom 428 were girls. A hospital and 4 dispensaries treat about 30,000 persons annually. J\u0101far\u0101b\u0101d contains 2 dispensaries, which treated 6,000 persons in 1903\u20134. Nearly 3,000 persons, or 36 per 1,000 of the population, are vaccinated annually.\n\nJanjira Village.\u2014Capital of the State of Janjira, Bombay, situated in 18\u00b0 18' N. and 73\u00b0 E., 44 miles south of Bombay Island. Population (1901), 1,620. The fort of Janjira, on an island at the entrance of the R\u0101jpuri creek, lies half a mile from the mainland on the east, and a mile from the mainland on the west. Its walls rise abruptly from the water to a height of 50 feet, with battlements and loopholes.\nIn the bastions and on the walls are ten guns. In the fort a Muhammadan fair is held in November, attended by about 3,000 visitors. On N\u0101nwell headland, about 2 miles west of the fort, a lighthouse shows a dioptric light of order 4, about 150 feet above sea-level. It serves to light the dangerous sunken reef known as the Chor K\u0101ssa, situated about three-quarters of a mile from the headland.\n\nJ\u0101nsath Tahsil.\u2014South-eastern tahsil of Muzaffarnagar District, United Provinces, lying between 29\u00b0 10' and 29\u00b0 36' N. and 77\u00b0 35' and 78\u00b0 6' E., with an area of 451 square miles. The population increased from 193,533 in 1891 to 216,411 in 1901. The tahsil contains four towns: namely, Khatauli (population, 8,695), Mir\u0101npur (7,209), J\u0101nsath (6,507), the tahsil head-quarters, and Bh\u016bkarher\u012b (6,316); and 244 villages. In 1903\u20134 the demand for land revenue was Rs. 3,60,000, and for cesses Rs. 47,000. The Ganges bounds the tahsil on the east, and the low land on the bank of the river is swampy; but the greater part lies on the upland and is protected by the Upper Ganges Main Canal and the An\u016bpshahr branch. In 1903\u20134 the area under cultivation was 307 square miles, of which 115 were irrigated.\n\nJ\u0101nsath Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the tahsil of the same name in Muzaffarnagar District, United Provinces, situated in 29\u00b0 19' N. and 77\u00b0 51' E., 14 miles from Muzaffarnagar town. Population (1901), 6,507. The town is famous as the home of the J\u0101nsath Saiyids, who held the chief power in the Delhi empire during the early part of the eighteenth century. J\u0101nsath was sacked and destroyed by a Rohilla force, under the orders of the Waz\u012br Kamar-ud-din, in 1737, and many Saiyids were slain or exiled; but some of their descendants still live in the town. J\u0101nsath is administered under Act XX of 1856, with an income of about Rs. 2,000. It contains a tahsil, an Anglo-veracular school opened by private subscription, and a dispensary. Much has been done lately to improve the place by paving the streets and the drains.\n\nJanw\u0101d\u0101.\u2014T\u0101luk of Bidar District, Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State. See K\u0101r\u0101mung\u012b T\u0101luk.\n\nJaor\u0101 State.\u2014A treaty State, situated in the M\u0101lw\u0101 Agency of Central India, with an area of 568 square miles, of which 128 have been alienated in land grants. The territories of the State are much split up, the main portion lying between 23\u00b0 30' and 23\u00b0 55' N. and 75\u00b0 0' and 75\u00b0 30' E. It is bounded by portions of the Indore, Gwalior, and Ratl\u0101m States of the Agency, the State of Part\u0101bgarh in R\u0101jput\u0101na, and the Thakur\u0101t of Piplod\u0101. It takes its name from Jaor\u0101 town, at which the head-quarters are situated. The whole State lies on the M\u0101lw\u0101 highlands, and shares in the general conditions common to that region. There are only two rivers of importance, the Chambal and Sipr\u0101.\nGhaf\u016br Kh\u0101n was an Afgh\u0101n of the T\u0101jik Khel, from Sw\u0101t. His grandfather, Abdul Majid Kh\u0101n, originally came to India in hopes of making a fortune; and his two sons Abdul Ham\u012bd and Abdur R\u0101s entered the service of Ghul\u0101m K\u0101dir Kh\u0101n, notorious for having blinded the aged emperor Sh\u0101h Alam in 1788. On the execution of Ghul\u0101m K\u0101dir by Sindhia they settled in Rohilkhand. Ghaf\u016br Kh\u0101n was the fourth and youngest son of Abdul Ham\u012bd. He married a daughter of Muhammad Ay\u0101z Kh\u0101n, who held a high post at the Jodhpur court. Ay\u0101z Kh\u0101n assisted the freebooter Am\u012br Kh\u0101n in settling the dispute between the chiefs of Jaipur and Jodhpur regarding the hand of the Udaipur princess Krishna Kunwari; and the friendship thus started led Ay\u0101z to give his younger daughter to Am\u012br Kh\u0101n, who then took Ghaf\u016br Kh\u0101n into his service, and employed him as his confidential agent and representative at the court of Holkar, when absent on distant expeditions. After the battle of Mehidpur (Dec. 21, 1817), Holkar was forced to make terms, and signed the Treaty of Mandasor (see Indore State), by the twelfth article of which it was agreed that Naw\u0101b Ghaf\u016br Kh\u0101n should be confirmed in possession of Sanjit, Malh\u0101rgarh, T\u0101l, Jaor\u0101, and Barauda, and draw tribute from Piplod\u0101. The Naw\u0101b was at the same time required to furnish a quota of 500 horse and 500 foot and four guns for the assistance of the British Government, an obligation which was later on commuted for a cash payment. Am\u012br Kh\u0101n protested against this clause, on the ground that Ghaf\u016br Kh\u0101n was holding the districts as his agent; but the claim was not admitted.\n\nIn 1821 certain agreements were mediated between the Naw\u0101b and the Malh\u0101rgarh Th\u0101kurs. The Malh\u0101rgarh Th\u0101kurs claimed to be tributary j\u0101g\u012brd\u0101rs, but it was held that they were merely guaranteed leaseholders, the tenure depending on the due observance of the terms of their holding; until 1890 they were a constant source of trouble to the Darb\u0101r.\n\nIn 1825 Ghaf\u016br Kh\u0101n died, leaving an infant son, Ghaus Muhammad Kh\u0101n (1825-65). He was placed on the masnad, nazar\u0101na (succession dues) of 2 lakhs being paid to Holkar. The management of the State was left to the late Naw\u0101b's widow, but after two years she was removed from the control for mismanagement. In 1842 Ghaus Muhammad Kh\u0101n received administrative powers. In the same year a money payment of 1\u00b76 lakhs was accepted in lieu of the troops required to be kept up under the treaty, and in return for good services during the Mutiny this was further reduced to 1\u00b74 lakhs in 1859. Three years later a sanad was granted guaranteeing succession in accordance with Muhammadan law. Ghaus Muhammad died in 1865, leaving a son of eleven years of age, Muhammad Ismail Kh\u0101n (1865-95), who was duly installed, the usual nazar\u0101na of 2 lakhs being paid to Holkar. The Naw\u0101b was placed in\ncharge of the State in 1874, but his administration was not a success. He incurred a debt of about 16 lakhs, and, in addition, borrowed 3 lakhs from Government. Muhammad Ismail died in 1895 and was succeeded by his son Iftikh\u0101r Ali Kh\u0101n, the present chief, then a boy of twelve, the management of the State being entrusted to the Naw\u0101b's uncle, V\u0101r Muhammad Kh\u0101n, until 1906, when the chief received powers of administration. The young chief was educated at the Daly College at Indore, and in 1902 he joined the Imperial Cadet Corps. The present ruler bears the titles of His Highness and Fakhr-ud-daula Naw\u0101b Saulat Jang, the second and last dignities being personal, and is entitled to a salute of 13 guns.\n\nThe population of the State was: (1881) 108,834, (1891) 117,650, and (1901) 84,202. In the latest year Hindus numbered 62,405, or 74 per cent. of the total; Musalm\u0101ns, 15,854, or 19 per cent.; Jains, 3,314, or 4 per cent.; and Animists, 2,585, or 3 per cent. (mostly Bhils and Sondhi\u0101s). Of the Muhammedan population, 73 per cent. live in Jaor\u0101 town. The density of population is 148 persons per square mile, that for all M\u0101lw\u0101 being only 116. There are two towns, Jaor\u0101 (population, 23,854), the capital, and T\u0101l (4,954); and 337 villages. The population rose in the period ending 1891 by 8 per cent., but fell during the last decade by 29 per cent., chiefly on account of the famine of 1899\u20131900. The R\u0101ngri or M\u0101lw\u012b dialect of R\u0101jasth\u0101n\u012b is spoken by 70 per cent. Besides the animistic tribes mentioned, the most numerous castes among Hindus are: R\u0101jp\u016bts, 7,200; Cham\u0101rs, 5,500; Kunbis, 5,000; and B\u0101lais, 3,700. About 38 per cent. of the population are supported by agriculture, and 12 per cent. by general labour.\n\nThe soil of the State is among the richest in M\u0101lw\u0101, being mainly of the best black cotton variety, bearing excellent crops of poppy. Of the total area of 568 square miles, 274, or 48 per cent., are under cultivation, of which 24 square miles are irrigated. Of the uncultivated area, 94 square miles, or 17 per cent. of the total area, are capable of cultivation, the rest being waste. Of the cropped area, jow\u0101r and cotton each occupy 49 square miles, or 16 per cent.; maize, 37 square miles, or 12 per cent.; poppy, 18 square miles, or 6 per cent.; and wheat, 10 square miles, or 3 per cent.\n\nThe chief means of communication are the Nimach-Mhow high road and the Jaor\u0101-Piplod\u0101 road, both metalled and kept up by Government; and the R\u0101jput\u0101na-M\u0101lw\u0101 Railway and the Ratl\u0101m-Godhra-Baroda branch of the Bombay, Baroda, and Central India Railway, which joins the R\u0101jput\u0101na-M\u0101lw\u0101 at Ratl\u0101m, and forms the shortest route to Bombay.\n\nFor administrative purposes the State is divided into seven tahsils (or districts)\u2014Jaor\u0101, Barauda, Barkhera, Malh\u0101rgarh, Naw\u0101bganj, Sanjit, and T\u0101l Mand\u0101wal\u2014each under a tahsild\u0101r, who is collector of revenue and magistrate of the district.\nThe chief is the final authority in all general administrative and civil judicial matters. In criminal cases, however, he is required to submit all cases involving the penalty of death for confirmation by the Agent to the Governor-General. The judicial system was organized in 1885 on the model of British courts, and the punishments laid down in the British codes were introduced in place of the primitive pains and penalties which were then in force.\n\nNo revenue survey has as yet been made, and crops are appraised on the ground before the harvest. The incidence of land revenue demand is Rs. 3 per acre of cultivated land, and Rs. 1-8 per acre on the total area. Collections are made in cash, in three instalments.\n\nThe total revenue of the State amounts to 8.5 lakhs, of which 5.8 lakhs, or 68 per cent., is derived from land; Rs. 29,000, or 3 per cent., from opium; Rs. 25,000, or 3 per cent., from customs; and Rs. 14,000 from tribute. The chief heads of expenditure are: general administration, 1.2 lakhs; chief's establishment, Rs. 30,000; charges in respect of collection of land revenue, Rs. 62,600; police, Rs. 35,000; military, Rs. 34,000; public works, Rs. 31,000; tribute, Rs. 1,37,000.\n\nA duty of Rs. 7 per maund is levied on raw opium, and of Rs. 2 on every 10 lb. of the manufactured article. Dues are also levied on every chest of 140 lb.: namely, on Jaor\u0101-grown opium, Rs. 30; on foreign opium, Rs. 13 when it comes from a distance of 50 miles or less, and Rs. 9 when it comes from more than 50 miles. About 1,000 chests pass annually through the Government scales maintained in Jaor\u0101 town, at which the British Government levies an export duty on all opium passing through British India to the Chinese market. This duty amounts to about 5 lakhs a year.\n\nSince 1895 the British rupee has been legal tender.\n\nThe State maintains 59 regular cavalry, 124 infantry, and 48 artillery with 16 guns, besides 36 irregulars. The police force was organized in 1892, and now includes 370 regular police and 332 rural police, giving 1 man to every 226 persons. A Central jail is maintained at Jaor\u0101 town.\n\nAn English school was started in 1866. In 1896 the Barr High School, teaching up to the University entrance standard, was opened. There are now ten other State schools, as well as several private institutions, which are supported by grants-in-aid. The cost of education is Rs. 5,000 a year.\n\nTwo hospitals are maintained in Jaor\u0101 town, one for men and one for women, and five dispensaries in the districts.\n\nJaor\u0101 Town.\u2014Capital of the State of the same name in Central India, situated in 23\u00b0 38' N. and 75\u00b0 8' E., about 1,600 feet above the level of the sea, with an area of 2\u00bd square miles. Jaor\u0101 is on the Ajmer-Khandwa branch of the Rajputana-Malwa Railway. 432 miles\nfrom Bombay. The village of Jaor\u0101 belonged originally to the Khatki R\u0101jputs, but was taken by Ghaf\u016br Kh\u0101n as the site of his chief town. It is divided into twenty-six quarters, containing bazars for the sale of different articles. The public buildings include two hospitals, one for males and one for females, a guesthouse, a high school and two smaller educational institutions, a jail, a post and telegraph office, and several sarais. Population has increased regularly: (1881) 19,902, (1891) 21,844, (1901) 23,854. Hindus form 43 per cent. and Musalm\u0101ns 48 per cent. of the total. The town is watched by a police force of 41 constables.\n\nJ\u0101pvo.\u2014The highest mountain in Assam (9,890 feet), situated in 25\u00b0 36' N. and 94\u00b0 4' E., in the Assam Range a little to the south of Koh\u012bm\u0101 (N\u0101g\u0101 Hills District).\n\nJasdan State.\u2014State in the K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r Political Agency, Bombay, lying between 21\u00b0 56' and 22\u00b0 17' N. and between 71\u00b0 8' and 71\u00b0 35' E., with an area of 283 square miles. The population in 1901 was 25,727, residing in 56 villages. The revenue in 1903-4 was Rs. 1,23,000, and 151 square miles were cultivated, of which 19 square miles were irrigated. Jasdan ranks as a third-class State in K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r. Jasdan town may derive its name from Sw\u0101mi Chashtana, one of the very earliest of the Kshatrapa dynasty. During the rule of the Ghoris of Jun\u0101garh, a strong fort was built there, and the town was called Ghor\u012bgarh. Later on it fell into the hands of the Khum\u0101ns of Kherdi and was conquered from Jasa Khum\u0101n about 1665 by Vika Kh\u0101char, the grandson of Lakha Kh\u0101char, the founder of the Lakhani branch of Kh\u0101chars. In the time of Vajsur Kh\u0101char, who was a powerful chief and established a p\u0101l or claim to blackmail over the surrounding country as far as Dhandhuka and Cambay, it was taken by Bhaunagar. Subsequently Jasdan was seized by the J\u0101m of Nav\u0101nagar, but he restored it to Vajsur Kh\u0101char on the occasion of the marriage of J\u0101m Jasaji. Vajsur Kh\u0101char came to terms with the British and the Gaikw\u0101r in 1807-8. The State is now ruled by this family with the title of chief. They follow the rule of primogeniture.\n\nJasdan Town.\u2014Chief town of the State of the same name in K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r, Bombay, situated in 22\u00b0 5' N. and 71\u00b0 20' E., about 4 miles north-east of Atkot, and 6 miles north of Kotra Pitha, both of which are on the R\u0101jkot-Bhaunagar high road. Population (1901), 4,628. Jasdan is a town of great antiquity, and possibly derives its name from Sw\u0101mi Chashtana, the second ruler of the Kshatrapa dynasty. During the rule of the Ghor\u012bs of Jun\u0101garh a strong fort was built here, and the town was called Ghor\u012bgarh. A good road connects it with Vinchia. An agricultural bank has recently been opened in Jasdan for the benefit of the cultivating classes.\n\nJashpur.\u2014Tributary State in the Central Provinces, lying between\n22\u00b0 17' and 23\u00b0 15' N. and 83\u00b0 30' and 84\u00b0 24' E., with an area of 1,948 square miles. Till 1905 it was included in the Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur States of Bengal. It is bounded on the north and west by the Surguj\u0101 State; on the east by the R\u0101nch\u012b District of Bengal; and on the south by G\u0101ngpur, Udaipur, and Raigarh. Jashpur consists in almost equal proportions of highland and lowland. On the R\u0101nch\u012b side the magnificent table-land of Upargh\u0101t attains an average elevation of 2,200 feet above the sea, and is fringed by hills which in places rise 1,000 feet higher. On the east the Upargh\u0101t blends with the plateau of Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur proper; while on the west it springs from the lowland region known as the Hetgh\u0101t in a scarped fortress-like wall, buttressed here and there by projecting masses of rock. The Upargh\u0101t again is divided by a slight depression from the still loftier plateau of Khuri\u0101, which occupies the north-western corner of the State, forming the watershed between the Ib and the Kanhar, a tributary of the river Son. This plateau consists of trap-rock topped with volcanic laterite, overlying the granite and gneiss which form the surface rocks at lower elevations. The lowlands of the Hetgh\u0101t and of Jashpur proper lie in successive steps descending towards the south, broken by ranges of low hills, isolated bluffs, and bare masses of gneiss and other metamorphic rocks. The granite of this low region frequently rises into bare round knolls, the most conspicuous of which is called the Burha from its fancied resemblance to an old man's bald head. The principal peaks are R\u0101njula (3,527 feet), Kotwar (3,393 feet), and Bharamurio (3,390 feet). The chief river is the Ib, which flows through the State from north to south. Several waterfalls are found along its course, the finest being formed by the rush of its waters over a square mass of trap-rock, where it passes from the high table-land of the Upargh\u0101t into the flat country of Jashpur proper. Owing to numerous rapids, the river is not navigable below these falls. The smaller rivers of Jashpur are mere hill streams, all of which are fordable except at brief intervals during the rains. In the north these are feeders of the Kanhar, and flow towards the valley of the Ganges, while on the south they run into the Ib and contribute to the river system of Orissa. Gold is obtained in small quantities from the banks and bed of the Ib river, near the G\u0101ngpur border, by the Jhor\u0101 Gonds, who wash the soil; they make over the gold to the Raj\u0101 and are paid by him in rice. Iron is procured in a nodular form in the hilly tracts, and is smelted by aboriginal tribes for export. The forests consist largely of sal (Shorea robusta), siss\u016b (Dalbergia Sissoo), and ebony (Diospyros melanoxylon); but owing to their distance from the railway there is as yet little demand for the timber. Those near the G\u0101ngpur border have recently,\n\n---\n\n1 This figure, which differs from the area shown in the Census Report of 1901, was supplied by the Surveyor-General.\nhowever, been leased to a contractor. Besides timber, the chief jungle products are lac, *tasar* silk, and beeswax, all of which are exported, *sabai* grass (*Ischaemum angustifolium*), and a large number of edible roots and indigenous drugs. The jungles contain tigers, leopards, wolves, bears, buffaloes, bison, and many kinds of deer.\n\nThe State of Jashpur was ceded to the British Government by the provisional agreement concluded with Mudhoji Bhonsla in 1818. Although noticed in the second article of this agreement as a separate State, Jashpur was at first treated in some measure as a fief of Surguja, and the tribute, the amount of which was last fixed in 1899 at Rs. 1,250, is still paid through that State. The chief, however, is not bound to render any feudal service to Surguja. The population increased from 113,636 in 1891 to 132,114 in 1901. They dwell in 566 villages, and the density is 68 persons per square mile. The large increase is due chiefly to the inducements held out to immigrants to settle in the State, where the area of cultivable waste is very large. The people have also benefited by the introduction of sugar-cane and wheat cultivation, and roads have been constructed from the capital to the borders of Ranchi, Surguja, Udaipur, and Gangapur. The most numerous castes and tribes are Oraons (47,000), Rautias (12,000), Korwas (10,000), Ahirs or Goalas and Nagesias (9,000 each), and Chiks and Kaurs (7,000 each). A rebellion of the Korwas gave considerable trouble some years ago. Pandrapat and the table-lands of the Khuri plateau afford excellent pasturage; and Ahirs or cowherds from Mirzapur and elsewhere bring large herds of cattle to graze, the fees paid by them being a considerable source of income to the State. Many Ahirs have settled permanently in Khuri. The trade is confined to food-grains, oilseeds, and jungle products, and is carried on by means of pack-bullocks.\n\nThe relations of the chief with the British Government are regulated by a *sanad* granted in 1899, and reissued in 1905 with a few verbal changes due to the transfer of the State to the Central Provinces. Under this *sanad* the chief was formally recognized and permitted to administer his territory subject to prescribed conditions, and the tribute was fixed for a further period of twenty years, at the end of which it is liable to revision. The chief is under the general control of the Commissioner of Chhattisgarh as regards all important matters of administration, including the settlement and collection of land revenue, the imposition of taxes, the administration of justice, arrangements connected with excise, salt, and opium, and disputes in which other States are concerned; and he cannot levy import and export dues or transit duties, unless they are specially authorized by the Chief Commissioner. He is permitted to levy rents and certain other customary dues from his subjects, and is empowered to pass sentences\nof imprisonment up to five years and of fine to the extent of Rs. 200; but sentences of imprisonment for more than two years and of fine exceeding Rs. 50 require the confirmation of the Commissioner. Heinous offences calling for heavier punishment are dealt with by the Political Agent, Chhattisgarh Feudatories, who exercises the powers of a District Magistrate and Assistant Sessions Judge; the Commissioner occupies the position of a Sessions Court in respect of such cases, while the functions of a High Court are vested in the Chief Commissioner.\n\nThe revenue of the State from all sources in 1904-5 was Rs. 1,26,000, of which Rs. 50,000 was derived from land, Rs. 11,000 from excise, and Rs. 7,000 from forest. The expenditure in the same year was Rs. 1,05,000, including Rs. 22,000 spent on administration, Rs. 35,000 on domestic charges, and Rs. 6,000 on public works. The State maintains 199 miles of roads. The current revenue demand is Rs. 60,000 per annum, collected through lease-holders, called thekad\u0101rs, with whom the villages are settled. The latter fix and collect the assessment payable by each cultivator in the village, and the amount is not changed during the term of the settlement. The thekad\u0101rs have no rights beyond that period; but the lease is generally renewed with the old thekad\u0101r, and a son generally succeeds his father, though no hereditary rights are recognized. The State maintains a police force of 12 officers and 35 men, and there is also a body of village police who receive a monthly salary. There is a jail with accommodation for 102 prisoners at Jashpurnagar, where the State also maintains a dispensary at which 2,000 patients were treated in 1904-5. In the same year 6,000 persons were successfully vaccinated. In 1901 only 862 persons could read and write; but some new schools have been opened by the State since that time, and in 1904-5 there were 15 schools with an attendance of 300 pupils.\n\nJashpurnagar (or Jagdispur).\u2014Head-quarters of the Jashpur State, Central Provinces, situated in 22\u00b0 53' N. and 84\u00b0 8' E. Population (1901), 1,654. It contains the residence of the chief, a dispensary, and a jail.\n\nJaso (Jasso).\u2014A petty sanad State in the Baghelkhand Political Charge of the Central India Agency, lying between 24\u00b0 20' and 24\u00b0 34' N. and 80\u00b0 28' and 80\u00b0 40' E., with an area of about 72 square miles. It is bounded on the north, east, and south by the N\u0101god State, and on the west by the Ajaigarh State. The population in 1901 was 7,209. The j\u0101gird\u0101r is a Bundel\u0101 R\u0101jput descended from Chhatars\u0101l, founder of the Pann\u0101 State. On the death of Chhatars\u0101l the Jaso and B\u0101ndhora j\u0101girs were assigned to his fourth son Bh\u0101rti Chand, who held under his brother Jagat R\u0101j, the chief of Jaitpur. Bh\u0101rti Chand bequeathed B\u0101ndhora to his eldest son Durjan Singh and Jaso to his second son Har\u012b Singh. Durjan Singh was suc-\nceeded by his son Medni Singh, who died childless, and B\u0101ndhora was absorbed into Jaso. Early in the nineteenth century the j\u0101g\u012br fell to Ali Bah\u0101dur of B\u0101nd\u0101, who assigned it to Gop\u0101l Singh, a rebel servant of the holder Chet Singh. Gop\u0101l Singh, however, espoused the cause of M\u016brat Singh, Chet Singh's infant son. On the establishment of the British supremacy, Jaso was held to be subordinate to the Ajaigarh State, and was included in the Kotra pargana secured to the Ajaigarh chief by the sanad granted him in 1807. To this an objection was raised; and on reference to the British Government it was finally decided that the suzerainty of Ajaigarh had never been more than nominal, and a separate sanad was granted to M\u016brat Singh in 1816 confirming him in independent possession of Jaso. Jagat R\u0101j Singh, the present chief, succeeded in 1888, but in 1899 withdrew from active participation in the management. His son Girwar Singh, who is a minor, is being educated at the Daly College at Indore, the State being under superintendence.\n\nJaso includes 60 villages and has a cultivated area of 29 square miles, or 40 per cent. of the total. The total revenue is Rs. 23,000, of which Rs. 21,000 is derived from land.\n\nThe capital, Jaso, is picturesquely situated in 24\u00b0 30' N. and 80\u00b0 30' E., on the banks of a fine lake. The name is said to be a contracted form of Jaseshvar\u012b-nagar, and the place was at various times known as Mahendr\u012b-nagar, Adharpur\u012b, and Hard\u012b-nagar. A small temple, a curious lingam, and several sa\u1e6d\u012b stones stand in the town, while numerous Jain and Hindu remains lie scattered round it. A vernacular school and a hospital are situated here.\n\n[A. Cunningham, Archaeological Survey Reports, vol. xxi, p. 99.]\n\nJasol.\u2014Head-quarters of a j\u0101g\u012br estate of the same name in the Mall\u0101ni district of the State of Jodhpur, R\u0101jput\u0101na, situated in 25\u00b0 49' N. and 72\u00b0 13' E., on the left bank of the L\u016bni river, 2 miles from B\u0101lotra station on the Jodhpur-Bikaner Railway. Population (1901), 2,543. The village, which is built partly on the slope of a hill, possesses a post office, a vernacular school, and a small hospital. The estate consists of 72 villages, and is held by a Th\u0101kur on payment of a tribute of Rs. 2,100 to the Jodhpur Darb\u0101r. About 5 miles to the north-west are the ruins of Kher, the old capital of Mall\u0101ni, while to the south-west are the remains of another important town, Nagar. As these places decayed, Jasol rose, and now contains the descendants of some of the earliest R\u0101thor settlers.\n\nJaspur.\u2014Town in the K\u0101sh\u012bpur tahsil of Nain\u012b T\u0101l District, United Provinces, situated in 29\u00b0 17' N. and 78\u00b0 50' E. Population (1901), 6,480. The town is of modern growth and contains few brick houses. It is administered under Act XX of 1856, with an income of about Rs. 2,000. There is a considerable manufacture of cotton cloth\nby Julah\u0101s (Muhammadan weavers), who reside here, and also some trade in sugar and timber.\n\n**Jaswantnagar.**\u2014Town in the District and tahsil of Etawah, United Provinces, situated in 26\u00b0 53' N. and 78\u00b0 53' E., on the East Indian Railway. Population (1901), 5,405. The town is named after Jaswant Rai, a K\u0101yasth from Mainpuri, who settled here in 1715. A small Hindu temple west of the town was occupied on May 19, 1857, by mutineers of the 3rd Native Cavalry; during a bold attempt to dislodge them, the Joint-Magistrate was wounded in the face. The town was once a municipality, but is now administered under Act XX of 1856, with an income of about Rs. 1,800. There is a considerable trade in yarn, cattle, country produce, and English piece-goods, besides an export of ghi and of kh\u0101r\u016ba cloth, which is largely manufactured. Ornamental brassware is also made here, articles for religious use by Hindus being chiefly produced. The town school has about 115 pupils, and there is a branch of the American Presbyterian Mission.\n\n**Jaswant S\u0101gar.**\u2014A large artificial lake in Jodhpur State. See Luni.\n\n**Jath State.**\u2014Native State in the Political Agency of Bij\u0101pur, Bombay. See Bij\u0101pur Agency.\n\n**Jath Town.**\u2014Chief town of the State of the same name, in Bombay, situated in 17\u00b0 3' N. and 75\u00b0 16' E., 92 miles south-east of S\u0101t\u0101ra town, 95 miles north-east of Belgaum, and 150 miles south-east-by-south of Poona. Population (1901), 5,404. The town is administered as a municipality, with an income (1903-4) of Rs. 3,040.\n\n**J\u0101ti.**\u2014T\u0101luka of Kar\u0101chi District, Sind, Bombay, lying between 23\u00b0 35' to 24\u00b0 38' N. and 68\u00b0 1' to 68\u00b0 48' E., with an area of 2,145 square miles. It contains 117 villages, but no town. The population in 1901 was 31,752, compared with 27,895 in 1891. The density is only 15 persons per square mile; and this is the most thinly populated t\u0101luka in the District, owing to its barren and unproductive soil and the large tracts of k\u0101lar land and salt deposits which it contains. The land revenue and cesses in 1903-4 amounted to nearly a lakh. Mughalbhin is the head-quarters. The southern portion is a maze of tidal creeks, and farther inland there is a salt plain, while the north-eastern portion is chiefly cultivable waste. Irrigation depends upon four canals, which directly tap the Indus. The chief crops are rice, b\u0101jra, barley, t\u012bl and other oilseeds.\n\n**J\u0101ting\u0101.**\u2014River of Assam, which rises near H\u0101flang in the North C\u0101ch\u0101r hills, and flowing west and south falls into the Bar\u0101k. The hill section of the Assam-Bengal Railway has been taken up the valley of the J\u0101ting\u0101, the line running along the right bank of the river. In the plains the J\u0101ting\u0101 passes near numerous tea gardens, and during the rainy season a small steamer goes up to B\u0101l\u0101chara near the foot\nof the hills. The river is nowhere bridged, but is crossed by five ferries, and is largely used as a trade route. Barkhal\u0101 B\u0101z\u0101r, B\u0101l\u0101chara, and D\u0101mchar\u0101 railway station are the most important places on its banks. Its total length is 36 miles.\n\n**Jatinga R\u0101mesvara.**\u2014Hill, 3,469 feet high, situated in $14^\\circ 50' N.$ and $76^\\circ 51' E.$, in the Molak\u0101lmuru t\u0101luk of Chitaldroog District, Mysore. It is one of the places where edicts of Asoka have been discovered, and consists of a long ridge, having towards the western end an ancient temple of R\u0101mesvara, the present building for which was erected in 962.\n\n**Jatoi.**\u2014Village in the Alipur tahsil of Muzaffargarh District, Punjab, situated in $29^\\circ 31' N.$ and $70^\\circ 51' E.$, 11 miles north-west of Alipur town. Population (1901), 4,748. Local tradition attributes its foundation to Mir Baj\u0101r Kh\u0101n, in the days of the emperor B\u0101bar. The Indus washed away the original town at the close of the last century, but it was shortly afterwards rebuilt on the present site. Jatoi was for some time subordinate to Bah\u0101walpur, but was annexed by Diw\u0101n S\u0101wan Mal. In the war against M\u016blr\u0101j, the Jatoi people threw off the Sikh rule, and rendered good service.\n\n**Jatpol.**\u2014A samasth\u0101n or tributary estate in the south of Mahbubnagar District, Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State, consisting of 89 villages, with an area of 191 square miles, and a population (1901) of 31,613. The total revenue is 1.9 lakhs, and the tribute paid to the Niz\u0101m is Rs. 73,537.\n\nFrom inscriptions it appears that in 1243 Annapota N\u0101yadu took possession of the estate, and captured Pangal and other forts. His dominions extended on the east as far as Srisil, on the west to Kotta and Sug\u016br, now belonging to the Wanparti samasth\u0101n, on the north to Devarkonda, and on the south they were bounded by the Kistna river. His descendants ruled for several centuries. In the last quarter of the eighteenth century R\u0101j\u0101 Jagann\u0101th Rao, having no male issue, adopted Lachma Rao, a scion of the Rao family of P\u0101kh\u0101l. In 1831 Lachma Rao obtained the Jatpol purgana from the Niz\u0101m on a fixed rental of Rs. 70,000. The present R\u0101j\u0101, Venkata Lachma Rao, who is a younger brother of the R\u0101j\u0101 of Venkatagiri in the Madras Presidency, also succeeded by adoption. He has cleared off debts amounting to nearly 2 lakhs, with which the estate was encumbered. The R\u0101j\u0101 resides at Kolhapur (population, 2,204), though until eighty years ago Jatpol was the head-quarters.\n\n**Jaugada.**\u2014Ruined fort in Ganj\u0101m District, Madras, situated in $19^\\circ 33' N.$ and $84^\\circ 50' E.$, about 18 miles west of Ganj\u0101m town, on the north bank of the Rushikulya in the Berhampur t\u0101luk, among the remains of what was once a large city surrounded by a wall. Towards the centre of the fort is a huge granite mass, on which are inscribed thirteen edicts of the Buddhist emperor Asoka (about 250 B.C.). They\nare of special interest as being the only examples of these edicts in the Madras Presidency. Old pottery and tiles abound within the fort wall; numbers of copper coins have been found, some of which are assigned to the first century A.D.; and an old temple has been discovered buried under d\u00e9bris and earth.\n\n**Jaulna.** \u2014 *T\u0101luk* and town in Aurang\u0101b\u0101d District, Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State. See J\u0100LNA.\n\n**Jaunpur District.** \u2014 North-western District of the Benares Division, United Provinces, lying between $25^\\circ 24'$ and $26^\\circ 12'$ N. and $82^\\circ 7'$ and $83^\\circ 5'$ E., with an area of 1,551 square miles. In shape it is an irregular triangle, with the southern boundary as base, and the eastern and western boundaries running up to a blunt apex in the north. The boundaries are formed\u2014on the south by Allah\u0101b\u0101d, Mirz\u0101pur, and Benares; on the east by Gh\u0101zipur and Azamgarh; on the north by Sult\u0101npur; and on the west by Sult\u0101npur and Part\u0101bgarh. Jaunpur District forms part of the Gangetic plain, but is slightly irregular in contour, with a series of undulating slopes. This apparent diversity of surface is increased by the occurrence of lofty mounds often covered with groves, which mark the sites of ruined or deserted towns, the relics of a forgotten race, or the demolished forts of the modern inhabitants. The entire area is very highly cultivated, and the village sites are small and scattered about at short intervals. While the country is well wooded, the trees are seldom planted together in groves. The District is divided into two unequal parts by the sinuous channel of the Gunt\u012b, a tributary of the Ganges, which flows past the capital city, and cuts off one-third of the area to the north-east. It is a considerable river and is crossed by a fine old stone bridge at Jaunpur, and by a railway bridge two miles lower down. The Gunt\u012b is liable to great and sudden floods. While its ordinary rise seldom exceeds 15 feet, it rose $23\\frac{1}{2}$ feet in fourteen days in September, 1871, and was 37 feet above its dry-season level. There are no streams of importance north of the Gunt\u012b; but it receives the Sai from the south, and a smaller affluent, called the Pili Nadi. The Barn\u0101 divides Mirz\u0101pur from Jaunpur and has a small tributary, called the Bas\u016bhi.\n\nJaunpur exposes nothing but Gangetic alluvium, in which kankar or calcareous limestone and saline efflorescences are the only minerals found.\n\nThe flora of the District does not differ from that of the Gangetic plain generally. The mango, mahua, shisham (*Dalbergia Sissoo*), various figs, and the babul (*Acacia arabica*) are the commonest trees. A weed called *rasni* or *baisurai* (*Pluchea lanceolata*), which grows in light soil, is of some hindrance to cultivation.\n\nOwing to the density of the population and the absence of forests or\nwaste lands, wild animals are scarce, and include only a few wolves in the ravines of the Gunti and Sai, an occasional nilgai, and small animals. Geese, duck, and quail are the commonest wild-fowl, and fish are found abundantly in the rivers and small jhils.\n\nThe climate of Jaunpur is moister, and the temperature more equable, than in most Districts of the United Provinces. In January the temperature ranges from about $50^\\circ$ to about $75^\\circ$, and in May and June from $80^\\circ$ to $110^\\circ$.\n\nThe annual rainfall averages 42 inches, the amount being almost the same in all parts of the District. While variations occur from year to year, extreme failures are very uncommon.\n\nThe earliest traditions connected with the District point to its occupation by aboriginal Bhars and Sooris. In the later Hindu period it contained several places of importance, chief among which was Zafar\u0101b\u0101d, then known as Manaitch.\n\nThis place has recently been identified as the fort of Munj, captured by Mahm\u016bd of Ghazni in 1019. The rule of the Musalm\u0101ns was not, however, established at that time, and towards the close of the eleventh century the District was included in the new R\u0101thor kingdom of Kanauj. When Muhammad Ghor\u012b commenced his victorious march against Jai Chand of Kanauj, the latter sent his vast treasures to the fort of Asni, which was also probably situated near Zafar\u0101b\u0101d, and after Jai Chand\u2019s death in 1194 the Muhammadans penetrated through this place to Benares. The magnificent temples of the R\u0101thor kings were plundered and overthrown, and although Hindu governors were recognized, they paid allegiance to the king of Delhi. In 1321 Ghiy\u0101sud-din Tughlak appointed his son, Zafar Kh\u0101n, governor, and thirty-eight years later, in 1359, Firoz Sh\u0101h Tughlak founded the city of Jaunpur. A eunuch, named Malik Sarwar, who had held important posts at the court of Delhi, was appointed Waz\u012br in 1389 with the title of Khw\u0101ja-i-Jah\u0101n. A few years later, in 1394, the administration of all Hindust\u0101n, from Kanauj to Bih\u0101r, was placed in his charge, so that he might reduce the turbulence of the Hindus, and he assumed the title of Sult\u0101n-ush-Shark, or \u2018king of the east.\u2019 The ambitious eunuch had hardly succeeded in his task when he declared his own independence, the revolt being rendered easier by Tim\u016br\u2019s invasion, which destroyed the last semblance of the authority of the kings of Delhi. Tim\u016br, on his departure from India, granted large j\u0101girs to Khizr Kh\u0101n, and Khw\u0101ja-i-Jah\u0101n materially strengthened his position by adopting Khizr Kh\u0101n\u2019s nephew, Karanph\u016bl, as his son and heir. The dynasty thus founded ruled at Jaunpur for nearly a century, and proved formidable rivals to the sovereigns of Delhi. Khw\u0101ja-i-Jah\u0101n died in 1399, and was succeeded by Karanph\u016bl under the title of Mub\u0101rak Sh\u0101h. An attempt was made by Ikh\u0101l Kh\u0101n, de facto ruler of Delhi,\nto crush the rising power, but without success. Mub\u0101rak Sh\u0101h died in 1401 and was succeeded by his brother, Ibr\u0101h\u012bm Sh\u0101h, who, like his successors, was a builder of magnificent mosques and a patron of learning. In 1407 Ibr\u0101h\u012bm achieved his desire and took Kanauj, Sambhal, and Baran (Bulandshahr). He was approaching Delhi when news came that Muzaffar Sh\u0101h (I) of Gujar\u0101t had defeated Hoshang Sh\u0101h of M\u0101lw\u0101, and had designs on Jaunpur. Ibr\u0101h\u012bm therefore withdrew, giving up his new acquisitions of Sambhal and Baran. By 1414, Khizr Kh\u0101n acquired the supreme power at Delhi. Ibr\u0101h\u012bm was thus for a time free from danger in that quarter, and set out in 1427 to attack K\u0101lp\u012b, but was opposed by Mub\u0101rak Sh\u0101h, who had succeeded Khizr Kh\u0101n in 1421. He made another unsuccessful attempt in 1432, and also invaded Bengal and other adjoining territory. Ibr\u0101h\u012bm died in 1440, and was succeeded by his son Mahm\u016bd, who was allowed by the king of M\u0101lw\u0101 to attack K\u0101lp\u012b in 1444, in order to punish an impious governor. Mahm\u016bd attempted to retain this fief, but was compelled to resign it. He then sacked Chun\u0101r and laid waste Orissa, and in 1452 advanced to Delhi during the absence of Bahlol Lodi, who had ascended the throne a year earlier. Bahlol returned and Mahm\u016bd retired; but a few years later hostilities again broke out and continued till Mahmud\u2019s death in 1459. His eldest son, Muhammad Sh\u0101h, was killed after a few months and was succeeded by another son called Husain Sh\u0101h. For some years Husain confined his incursions to Orissa, or to Bundelkhand and Baghelkhand; but at length he too undertook to invade Delhi, and lost his kingdom in the venture. The first expedition took place in 1473, and during the next few years fortune inclined now to one side and now to the other. In 1480, however, Husain was twice defeated in the Central Do\u0101b, and Jaunpur fell. Husain maintained hostilities in various directions, and in 1487 recovered Jaunpur for a time, but was soon driven out again, and B\u0101rbak Sh\u0101h, son of Bahlol, became governor. Bahlol died in 1489 and was succeeded by his son, Sikandar; B\u0101rbak Sh\u0101h also claimed the throne, and was defeated, but restored to his governorship. Revolts continued, and Husain Sh\u0101h made a final effort about 1496, but was repelled and died a few years later. When Ibr\u0101h\u012bm, last of the Lod\u012bs, was defeated and killed by B\u0101bar at P\u0101nipat in 1526, Bah\u0101dur Kh\u0101n, the governor of Bih\u0101r and Jaunpur, asserted his independence; but after the fall of Agra and Delhi, B\u0101bar sent his son Hum\u0101y\u016bn eastward. The Mughal rule was not, however, firmly established, and the Path\u0101ns under Sher Sh\u0101h and his successors governed the country for a time. On the revival of Mughal power, Jaunpur fell before Akbar\u2019s general in 1559, and remained in the Mughal empire till its break up, although rebellions took place soon after the capture of the city. At the reorganization of the empire in 1575 Allah\u0101b\u0101d became the capital of\nthe province in which Jaunpur was included. Nothing worthy of note occurred in connexion with this District until 1722, when it passed to the Naw\u0101b of Oudh. Some years later it was granted to Mans\u0101 R\u0101m, founder of the Benares Estate; and it remained in the possession of his family, with the exception of the fort of Jaunpur, though the Bangash Naw\u0101b of Farrukh\u0101b\u0101d nominated a governor about 1750, after defeating the Naw\u0101b of Oudh. The District was ceded to the British in 1775, with the rest of the Province of Benares.\n\nFrom that time nothing occurred which calls for notice till the date of the Mutiny. On June 5, 1857, news of the Benares revolt reached Jaunpur. The sepoys of the treasury guard at once mutinied and shot their own officers, as well as the Joint-Magistrate. They then marched off to Lucknow without molesting the other Europeans, who made good their escape to Benares. The District continued in a state of complete anarchy till the arrival of the Gurkha force from Azamgarh on September 8. The civil officials then returned to Jaunpur, and the police stations were re-established; but the north and west of the District remained in rebellion. In November, owing to the active levies made by Mahdi Hasan, who styled himself Nazim of Jaunpur, most of the surrounding country was lost again. But in February, 1858, the rebels of the north and west were defeated and dispersed; and in May the last smouldering embers of disaffection were stifled by the repulse of the insurgent leader, Jurl\u012b Singh, from Machhl\u012bshhahr at the hands of the people themselves.\n\nThe magnificent buildings of the Shark\u012b kings at Jaunpur, and the earlier buildings of Zafar\u0101b\u0101d, were partly constructed from the remains of Hindu temples, none of which has remained intact. A few inscriptions exist in them, and a copperplate grant of Gobind Chand, king of Kanauj, has been found in the District.\n\nJaunpur contains 7 towns and 3,152 villages. Population has varied. The numbers at the last four enumerations were as follows: (1872) 1,025,961, (1881) 1,209,663, (1891) 1,264,949, and (1901) 1,202,920. The enumeration of 1872 was probably imperfect; during the last decade the District suffered from a succession of bad seasons. There are five tahs\u012bls\u2014Jaunpur, Mari\u0101h\u016b, Machhl\u012bshhahr, Khut\u0101han, and Kir\u0101kat\u2014each named from its head-quarters except Khut\u0101han, which has its head-quarters at Sh\u0101hganj. The only municipality is Jaunpur City, the District capital. The table on the next page gives the chief statistics of population in 1901.\n\nHindus form nearly 91 per cent. of the total, and Musalm\u0101ns 9 per cent. The density of population is high in all parts of the District. About 81 per cent. of the population speak Eastern Hindi and 15 per cent. Bih\u0101r\u012b, the boundary between these languages passing through the north-east of the District.\nThe Hindu castes most largely represented are Cham\u0101rs (leather-workers and labourers), 182,000; Ahirs (graziers and agriculturists), 173,000; Br\u0101hmans, 146,000; R\u0101jputs, 101,000; Koiris (cultivators), 49,000; and Kurmis (agriculturists), 46,000. The aboriginal Bhars still number as many as 25,000. Among Musalm\u0101ns may be mentioned the Jul\u0101h\u0101s (weavers), 28,000; Shaikhs, 18,000; Path\u0101ns, 13,000; and Behn\u0101s (cotton-carders), 11,000. Agriculture supports as many as 77 per cent. of the total population, and general labour less than 2 per cent. R\u0101jputs own more than a third of the land, and Br\u0101hmans, Saiyids, Shaikhs, and Bani\u0101s are also large landholders. High castes also hold as tenants a rather greater proportion than the low castes. The inhabitants of this District supply considerable numbers of emigrants to Assam, the Eastern Districts of Bengal, and the colonies.\n\n| Tahsil     | Area in square miles | Number of Towns | Villages | Population | Population per square mile | Percentage of variation in population between 1891 and 1901 | Number of persons able to read and write |\n|------------|----------------------|----------------|----------|------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Jaunpur    | 280                  | 2              | 711      | 269,131    | 961                       | - 3.4                                           | 6,868                                  |\n| Mari\u0101h\u0101    | 321                  | 1              | 676      | 243,792    | 759                       | - 3.8                                           | 5,049                                  |\n| Machhl\u012bshahr | 344                | 2              | 610      | 233,431    | 679                       | - 4.6                                           | 5,494                                  |\n| Khut\u0101han   | 362                  | 1              | 700      | 269,438    | 744                       | - 6.1                                           | 7,542                                  |\n| Kir\u0101kat    | 244                  | 1              | 455      | 187,128    | 767                       | - 7.2                                           | 7,497                                  |\n| **District total** | **1,551**          | **7**          | **3,152**| **1,202,920**| **776**                   | **- 4.9**                                       | **32,450**                             |\n\nThere were only 62 native Christians in the District in 1901. Of these, 47 belonged to the Anglican communion and 8 were Methodists. The Church Missionary Society opened a branch at Jaunpur city in 1833. There has been a Wesleyan Mission at Sh\u0101hganj since 1879, and a Zan\u0101na Mission at Jaunpur since 1890.\n\nThe District being permanently settled, accurate details are not available as to the distribution of the various classes of soil. Generally speaking, light sandy soil is found near the banks of the rivers, especially the Sai and Gumt\u012b. The sand gradually changes to a very fertile loam which, however, requires constant irrigation; and, lastly, clay is found remote from the rivers. The largest clay tracts in which the best rice can be grown are found in the north and the south-west. The District is very highly cultivated, and there are no extensive areas of waste land, except a few \u012bsar plains in the Khut\u0101han tahsil. The Gumt\u012b and Sai frequently flood the low-lying land in their beds; but the loss is not serious, and the chief danger to agriculture is the liability of the spring crops to suffer from rust in a wet winter.\n\nThe usual tenures existing in the permanently settled tract of the\nUnited Provinces are found, zam\u012bnd\u0101ri mah\u0101ls being the commonest. The mah\u0101ls are, however, frequently complex: that is, a single mah\u0101l, instead of forming a single village (mauza) or part of a mauza, includes several mauzas or parts of mauzas. There are a few talukd\u0101ri estates; but the talukd\u0101rs are here known as peshkashd\u0101rs, and the under-proprietors as farotars. Most of these estates were originally grants for the maintenance of the Jaunpur garrison. The main agricultural statistics for 1903\u20134 are shown below, in square miles:\n\n| Tahsil     | Total | Cultivated | Irrigated | Cultivable waste |\n|------------|-------|------------|-----------|------------------|\n| Jaunpur    | 280   | 192        | 125       | 29               |\n| Mari\u0101h\u016b    | 321   | 212        | 116       | 39               |\n| Machhlisahr| 344   | 205        | 106       | 50               |\n| Khut\u0101han   | 362   | 228        | 129       | 50               |\n| Kir\u0101kat    | 244   | 161        | 95        | 27               |\n| **Total**  | **1,551** | **998**    | **571**   | **195**          |\n\nThe staple food-crops are barley, covering 303 square miles, or 28 per cent. of the net cultivated area, rice (251), peas and mas\u016br (137), and maize (124). The Jaunpur variety of maize is especially noted throughout the Provinces. Gram, wheat, arhar, jow\u0101r, and the smaller millets are also largely grown. Sugar-cane is an extremely valuable crop, and was grown on 53 square miles in 1903\u20134, while hemp (san) covered 14 square miles. Oilseeds, indigo, poppy, and tobacco cover smaller areas.\n\nWhen the District was first acquired in 1775 there were large areas of waste. Mr. Duncan, who carried out the permanent settlement, gave special facilities for breaking up waste, and also encouraged the growth of sugar-cane and introduced indigo, poppy, and potatoes. The result was a speedy increase in the cultivated area. During the last sixty years, however, the area under cultivation has increased by only 4 per cent., and the chief change recently has been the rise in the area double cropped. Indigo is declining rapidly, as in most parts of the Provinces; and the area sown is now only 5 square miles, or less than a quarter of what it was twenty years ago. Maize and rice are more largely grown than formerly in the autumn, and wheat in the spring harvest. In adverse seasons loans under the Agriculturists' Loans Act are taken, but advances under the Land Improvement Act are very rare. The total of loans from 1891 to 1900 amounted to only a lakh, of which Rs. 30,000 was advanced in 1896\u20137. Very small advances have been made since.\n\nThe cattle of the District are inferior, and the best animals are imported. A Government bull was once kept, and its services were eagerly sought for. The ponies are also of a poor stamp, but are\nlargely used as pack animals. Sheep and goats are of the ordinary type.\n\nOut of 571 square miles irrigated in 1903\u20134, wells supplied 442 square miles, tanks or jhils 126, and other sources 3. The area irrigated from tanks or jhils is probably understated, as every pond is used for irrigating the late rice. Water is raised from wells in a leathern bucket by bullocks or men, except in the extreme north, where the spring-level is so high that a lever can be used. Excellent wells can be made without brick linings, which will last from one to ten years. The tanks are sometimes artificial, but are all of small size; the swing-basket worked by four or eight persons is usually employed to raise water from tanks and jhils.\n\nKankar or calcareous limestone is found in all the upland parts of the District, and is used for metalling roads and for making lime.\n\nSugar-refining is the most important industry in the District. A little coarse cotton cloth is made in many places for local use. The manufacture of indigo still continues, but on a very small scale since the introduction of synthetic indigo. Jaunpur city is celebrated for the manufacture of scents, and also produces a little papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 work.\n\nThe District being almost entirely devoted to agriculture, its trade is confined to raw materials and food-stuffs. Sugar, food-grains, scents, and oilseeds form the chief exports; and salt, piece-goods, metals, and spices are imported. Jaunpur city, Shahganj, and Mungra Badshahpur are the chief trade centres.\n\nThe loop-line of the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway from Benares through Fyzabad to Lucknow traverses the District from south to north, while the main line of the same railway crosses the southwest corner. A branch from Zafarabad to Phaphamau on the Ganges is now under construction, which will give access to Allahabad. Shahganj is connected with Azamgarh, and Jaunpur city with Ghazipur, by branches of the Bengal and North-Western Railway.\n\nThe District is well supplied with roads, the length of which is 586 miles. Of the total, 186 miles are metalled and are maintained by the Public Works department, but the cost of all but 45 miles is met from Local funds. An excellent system of metalled roads radiates from Jaunpur city to Allahabad, Fyzabad, Azamgarh, Benares, and Mirzapur. Avenues of trees are maintained on 229 miles.\n\nJaunpur has usually escaped from famine, owing to the rarity of complete failure of the rains. No details are available for the famines of 1770 and 1783, but the pressure of high prices was felt in 1803\u20134. The disastrous seasons of 1837\u20138 and 1860\u20131 hardly affected this District, and even in 1868 the threatened famine was averted by heavy rain in September. The\nfamines of 1873-4 and 1877-8 also pressed very lightly. In 1896-7, however, the District suffered severely. Heavy rain had damaged the crops in 1894, and in the two following years the rainfall was deficient, so that the important late rice crop failed. Relief works were opened and advances were given for the construction of wells; but the first fall of rain in June, 1897, ended the famine.\n\nThe Collector is usually assisted by a member of the Indian Civil Service (when available), and by five Deputy-Collectors recruited in India. A tahsildar is stationed at the head-quarters of each tahsil.\n\nThere are two District Munsifs, a Subordinate Judge, and a District Judge for civil work. The Court of Sessions hears the sessions cases of Basti District as well as those of Jaunpur. Owing to the pressure on the soil, disputes about cultivation, proprietary rights, and irrigation are common, and sometimes lead to serious riots; but the worst kinds of crime, such as murder and dacoity, are not very prevalent. Female infanticide was found by Mr. Duncan to be rife in 1789, and on the passing of an Act for its repression in 1870 a large number of persons were proclaimed; but all have since been exempted, and the practice is believed to be extinct.\n\nThough a Judge-Magistrate was placed in charge of an area corresponding to the present District as early as 1795, the revenue administration was not separated from that of Benares till 1818. From its acquisition in 1775 the District was in charge of the R\u0101j\u0101 of Benares till 1788, when Mr. Duncan, the Resident, commenced a settlement which was made permanent in 1795. Default in the payment of revenue, and the turbulence of the population of this part of the huge District of Benares, led to the formation of a Deputy-Collectorate of Jaunpur in 1818, which soon became a separate District. In 1820 a large tract of what is now Azamgarh District was placed under the Collector of Jaunpur, but part of it was removed in 1823 and the rest in 1830. There have been a few other smaller changes. The revenue demand fixed by Mr. Duncan on the present area amounted to 11.1 lakhs, rising to 11.3 lakhs. It has since increased to 12.5 lakhs, owing to the inclusion of land not previously assessed. The permanent settlement included no detailed record-of-rights and was not based on a survey; and maps and records were not prepared till between 1839 and 1841. In 1849 the rent payable by the farotars to the peshkash-d\u0101rs was for the first time determined and recorded. The whole of the records prepared in 1841 were destroyed in the Mutiny of 1857, and when order was restored an attempt was made to prepare them afresh. The new record was completed in 1867, but was soon found to be incorrect and inadequate. A fresh revision was, therefore, made between 1877 and 1886, based on a resurvey. The usual village\npapers are now prepared annually as in the rest of the Provinces. The incidence of land revenue is Rs. 1.4 per acre, varying from R. 1 to Rs. 2.2 in different parts of the District.\n\nCollections on account of land revenue and revenue from all sources have been, in thousands of rupees:\n\n|                | 1880-1 | 1890-1 | 1900-1 | 1903-4 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Land revenue   | 12.49  | 12.20  | 13.63  | 12.74  |\n| Total revenue  | 15.03  | 16.49  | 20.32  | 19.36  |\n\nJaunpur City is the only municipality, but six towns are administered under Act XX of 1856. The District board manages local affairs outside the limits of these, and in 1903-4 had an income expenditure of 1.1 lakhs, chiefly derived from local rates. The expenditure included Rs. 60,000 on roads and buildings.\n\nThere are 17 police stations; and the District Superintendent of police has a force of 3 inspectors, 83 subordinate officers, and 350 constables, besides 163 municipal and town police, and 1,954 rural and road police. The District jail contained a daily average of 231 prisoners in 1903.\n\nJaunpur District takes a low position as regards the literacy of its population, of whom 2.7 per cent. (5.4 males and 0.1 females) could read and write in 1901. Musalmans are distinctly more advanced in this respect than Hindus, 4.2 per cent. being literate. The number of public schools rose from 148 with 5,546 pupils in 1880-1 to 164 with 7,320 pupils in 1900-1. In 1903-4 there were 199 such schools with 8,862 pupils, of whom 169 were girls, besides 114 private schools with 1,792 pupils. Only 1,623 pupils were in classes beyond the primary stage. Two of the public schools were managed by Government, and 138 by the District and municipal boards. Out of a total expenditure on education of Rs. 40,000, Local funds contributed Rs. 30,000 and fees Rs. 8,000.\n\nThere are 8 hospitals and dispensaries, with accommodation for 53 in-patients. In 1903 the number of cases treated was 75,000, including 400 in-patients, and 3,000 operations were performed. The total expenditure was Rs. 8,000, which was chiefly met from Local funds.\n\nAbout 37,000 persons were successfully vaccinated in 1903-4, representing a proportion of 31 per 1,000 of population. Vaccination is compulsory only in the municipality of Jaunpur.\n\n[District Gazetteer (1884, under revision); P. C. Wheeler, Report on Revision of Records in Jaunpur (1886); A. F\u00fchrer, The Sharqi Architecture of Jaunpur (1889).]\n\nJaunpur Tahsil.\u2014Head-quarters tahsil of Jaunpur District, United\nProvinces, comprising the *pargana* of Haveli Jaunpur and *tappas* Saremau, R\u0101ri, Zafar\u0101b\u0101d, Kary\u0101t Dost, and Khaprah\u0101, and lying between $25^\\circ 37'$ and $25^\\circ 54'$ N. and $82^\\circ 24'$ and $82^\\circ 52'$ E., with an area of 280 square miles. Population fell from 278,482 in 1891 to 269,131 in 1901. There are 711 villages and two towns, including Jaunpur City (population, 42,771), the District and *tahsil* headquarters. The demand for land revenue in 1903\u20134 was Rs. 2,39,000, and for cesses Rs. 43,000. The density of population, 961 persons per square mile, is the highest in the District. The sinuous course of the Gumt\u012b winds through the centre of the *tahsil*, while the Sai crosses the western portion and then forms the southern boundary. There is a considerable area of sandy soil, and ravines furrow the ground near the rivers. The area under cultivation in 1903\u20134 was 192 square miles, of which 125 were irrigated, almost entirely from wells.\n\n**Jaunpur City.**\u2014Head-quarters of the District and *tahsil* of the same name, United Provinces, situated in $25^\\circ 45'$ N. and $82^\\circ 41'$ E., on the Oudh and Rohilkhand and Bengal and North-Western Railways, 515 miles by rail from Calcutta and 977 miles by rail from Bombay. It lies on the banks of the Gumt\u012b river, and at the junction of metalled roads from Allah\u0101b\u0101d, Fyz\u0101b\u0101d, Azamgarh, Benares, and Mirz\u0101pur. Population has been almost stationary for the past twenty years. The numbers at the last four enumerations were as follows: (1872) 35,003, (1881) 42,845, (1891) 42,815, and (1901) 42,771. In 1901 the population included 26,091 Hindus and 16,596 Musalm\u0101ns.\n\nThe origin of the name Jaunpur, also known as Jawanpur, and occasionally as Jamanpur, is uncertain. Hindus derive it from Jamadagni, a famous *rishi*, in whose honour a shrine has been raised, while Musalm\u0101ns assert that the city takes its name from Ulugh Kh\u0101n J\u016bn\u0101, afterwards Muhammad Sh\u0101h (II) bin Tughlak of Delhi. Up to the fourteenth century the neighbouring town of Zafar\u0101b\u0101d was of greater importance; but ancient remains show that a town existed also on the present site of Jaunpur. A shrine sacred to Kar\u0101r Bir, the giant demon slain by R\u0101ma, king of Ajodhy\u0101, still stands near the fort; and tradition says that the fort itself is on the site of a temple built by Bijai Chand of Kanauj in the twelfth century. In 1359 F\u012broz Sh\u0101h Tughlak halted at Zafar\u0101b\u0101d on his way to Bengal, and was struck by the suitability of the neighbourhood for the foundation of a new city, which was at once commenced. Some years later Jaunpur became the head-quarters of a governor, and in 1394 a eunuch named Khw\u0101ja-i-Jah\u0101n received the appointment. He soon declared himself independent; and for nearly a century, as has been related in the history of Jaunpur District, his successors ruled a varying area, which sometimes extended from Bih\u0101r to Sambhal and Aligarh (Koil), while\nthey even threatened Delhi. Jaunpur remained the seat of a governor till the reorganization of the empire by Akbar, who raised Allah\u00e1b\u0101d to the position of a provincial capital. From that date Jaunpur declined in political importance, though it retained some of its former reputation as a centre of Muhammadan learning, which had gained for it the title of the Sh\u012br\u0101z of India. On the acquisition of the province of Benares in 1775, Jaunpur became British territory, and an Assistant was posted here subordinate to the Resident at Benares. A Judge-Magistrate was appointed in 1795, and in 1818 Jaunpur became the head-quarters of a Sub-Collector and shortly afterwards of a Collector.\n\nThe main portion of the city lies on the left bank of the Gumti, while some outlying quarters and the civil station are situated on the right bank. The river is crossed here by a magnificent stone bridge built by Munim Kh\u0101n, governor under Akbar. In the city proper are situated the splendid monuments of the Jaunpur kings, which form the finest specimens of Path\u0101n architecture in Northern India. Very little remains of the earlier fort built by F\u012broz Sh\u0101h. It was an irregular quadrangular building, overlooking the Gumt\u012b and surrounded by a stone wall built round an artificial earthen mound. The materials were largely obtained from temples. In 1859 the towers and most of the buildings in the fort were destroyed. A magnificent gateway, added in the sixteenth century, a small mosque built in 1376, and a spacious set of Turkish baths constructed by Ibr\u0101h\u012bm Sh\u0101h, are alone fairly complete. The earliest mosque is that known as the At\u0101la Masjid, which was built by Ibr\u0101h\u012bm Sh\u0101h, and completed in 1408. It consists of a fine courtyard with double-storeyed cloisters on three sides, and the mosque itself on the west. The most striking feature is the magnificently decorated fa\u00e7ade, 75 feet in height, with a breadth of nearly 55 feet at the base, which stands before the dome of the mosque and recalls the propylons of Egypt. It consists of a great arched gateway surmounted by a pierced screen, and forming a recess in a gigantic frame flanked by massive towers. Smaller gateways of similar construction stand on either side. The At\u0101la Masjid is said to occupy the site of a temple of At\u0101la Dev\u012b which F\u012broz Sh\u0101h attempted to appropriate, but which he was induced to leave on account of the threatening attitude of the people. The Dariba Masjid, built by two of Ibr\u0101h\u012bm\u2019s nobles, has a domed hall and two wings, marked by a low fa\u00e7ade of the peculiar Jaunpur type, but with little ornamentation. It is said to have been built on the site of a temple of Bijai Chand of Kanauj. Only the great piers and beautiful central screen remain to show the magnificence of the Jhanjhri mosque, which was built by Ibr\u0101h\u012bm Sh\u0101h on the site of Jai Chand\u2019s temple at Mukt\u0101gh\u0101t, but was demolished by Sikandar Lodi. The L\u0101l Darw\u0101za mosque, erected by Bibi R\u0101j\u012b, the queen of Mahm\u016bd Sh\u0101h, is smaller than the At\u0101la\nMasjid, the propylon being only 49 feet high. The cloisters, which are of one story, are in a poor state of preservation. The J\u0101ma Masjid, or great mosque of Husain Sh\u0101h, is believed to have been founded as early as 1438; but work on it was suspended for many years, and it was not completed till 1478. The mosque stands on a raised terrace, and its courtyard is surrounded on three sides by cloisters with aisles, the upper story of which was pulled down by Sikandar Lodi. There is a massive domed entrance gateway in each of these sides, which also suffered at the hands of the Lodi king, and the fourth is occupied by the mosque proper with its majestic fa\u00e7ade 84 feet in height. This mosque is being gradually restored. Close to the northern gateway stands a small enclosure in which lie the modest tombs of Husain Sh\u0101h and some of his descendants; the tombs of the earlier rulers are situated on a platform in another part of the city. Many smaller mosques and tombs are to be seen, but no traces exist of the palaces and college which once graced Jaunpur. The modern public buildings are few and unimportant; they include the usual courts and two dispensaries, one of which is maintained by the Zan\u0101na Bible and Medical Mission.\n\nJaunpur has been a municipality since 1867. During the ten years ending 1901 the income and expenditure averaged Rs. 39,000 and Rs. 37,000 respectively. In 1903\u20134 the income was Rs. 58,000, chiefly derived from octroi (Rs. 39,000) and rents and fees (Rs. 11,000); and the expenditure was Rs. 57,000, including conservancy (Rs. 14,000), administration and collection (Rs. 10,000), and public safety (Rs. 11,000). The town is celebrated for the manufacture of perfumes from the flowers of the rose, jasmine, and screw-pine, and from the root of the khashhas grass (*Andropogon muricata*). Papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 articles, such as cigar-cases, book-covers, &c., are also made. The town was formerly noted for its paper manufacture, but this has died out. There is some trade in grain, and in the distribution of imported goods; but Jaunpur is not an important commercial centre. Two high schools and six of lower grade have a total attendance of 607 pupils. In addition to these, Arabic is taught at the J\u0101ma Masjid.\n\n[A. F\u00fchrer, *The Sharqi Architecture of Jaunpur* (1889).]\n\n**Jauns\u0101r-B\u0101war.**\u2014Name of a pargana which now forms the whole of the Chakr\u0101ta tahsil in Dehra D\u016bn District, United Provinces.\n\n**Jav\u0101di Hills.**\u2014A detached group of hills, in Madras, lying between 12\u00b0 18' and 12\u00b0 54' N. and 78\u00b0 35' and 79\u00b0 11' E., and for the most part situated in the south-west corner of North Arcot District, though spurs run down into South Arcot and Salem. In North Arcot some of the peaks attain an elevation of over 3,000 feet. They are there separated from the Eastern Ghats by the broad valley of the P\u0101l\u0101r. This narrows in the neighbourhood of Amb\u016br, where the Jav\u0101dis and\nthe Eastern Gh\u0101ts almost join, but it widens again as it leaves North Arcot and passes into Salem. The Jav\u0101dis are made up of numerous small plateaux, which contain in North Arcot 110 hamlets, or clusters of huts, inhabited by a Tamil-speaking hill tribe called Malaiy\u0101lis. These people number nearly 10,000; and though they appear to be ethnologically of the same stock as the Tamils of the low country, their long isolation has led to divergencies in their ways, and they possess certain peculiar customs of their own. The climate of the hills is malarious at certain seasons, but does not merit the utter condemnation generally accorded it. Spurs from the main range extend in a north-easterly direction as far as the town of Vellore, gradually declining in height as they approach the P\u0101l\u0101r. One detached peak, Kailasagarh, 2,743 feet in height, is only 6 miles distant from Vellore, and the small bungalow upon its summit forms a pleasant retreat during the hot season. The Javadis used to be covered with fine forest, but this has been almost entirely destroyed. Much damage was done when the construction of the south-west line of the Madras Railway was in progress, enormous quantities of timber being at that time felled for sleepers. Careful conservation is now helping to remedy the recklessness of past years. Game is fairly abundant in these hills. Bison, s\u0101mbar, spotted deer, leopards, and an occasional tiger are found in them. The Jav\u0101dis are one of the only two tracts in the Presidency where the cultivation of the intoxicating g\u0101nja (Cannabis sativa) is permitted under licence. A little coffee cultivation has been attempted on the South Arcot side, and the produce is sold in the local markets. There are relics of Hindu temples, with some inscriptions, at Kovilan\u016br on the way from Patrak\u0101d to Komatiy\u016br, and signs of former occupation by a civilized nation.\n\nJ\u0101vli.\u2014Northern t\u0101luka of S\u0101t\u0101ra District, Bombay, lying between 17\u00b0 32' and 17\u00b0 59' N. and 73\u00b0 36' and 73\u00b0 59' E., with an area, including the petty subdivision (p\u0113tha) of Malcolmpeeth, of 423 square miles. It contains one town, Malcolmpeeth or Mah\u0101baleshw\u0101r (population, 5,299); and 249 villages. The population in 1901 was 65,587, compared with 70,744 in 1891. The density, 155 persons per square mile, is much below the District average. The demand for land revenue in 1903-4 was Rs. 91,000, and for cesses Rs. 8,000. Throughout the hot season the Western Gh\u0101t hill tracts, which form a large part of the t\u0101luka, are cool and breezy. Medha, the t\u0101luka head-quarters, has an average rainfall of 81 inches annually, while Mah\u0101baleshw\u0101r receives 292 inches.\n\nJ\u0101wad.\u2014Town in the Mandasor district of Gwalior State, Central India, situated in 24\u00b0 36' N. and 74\u00b0 52' E., 1,410 feet above sea-level. Population (1901), 8,005. The town was founded about 500 years ago, and belonged originally to the chiefs of Mew\u0101r. In the time of R\u0101na\nSangram Singh and his successor Jagat Singh, the wall which now surrounds the town was erected. In 1818, during the Pindari War, Jaswant Rao Bhau, one of Sindhia's officers who then held Jawad, persisted in supporting the Pindari leaders Chit\u016b and F\u0101zil Kh\u0101n. The place was, therefore, attacked and taken by General Brown in 1819, but was subsequently restored to Sindhia. In 1844 it was included in the districts assigned for the maintenance of the Gwalior Contingent, but was again made over to Sindhia in 1860. Jawad is a commercial centre of some importance, a considerable trade in grain and cloth being carried on. It was formerly noted for its dyeing industry, the dye of the \u0101l (Morinda tinctoria) being used. Of late years, however, this trade has decayed owing to the introduction of European dyes. The town is still noted for its manufacture of bracelets, which are exported in large quantities to R\u0101jput\u0101na. The town customs dues amount to Rs. 27,000 a year. A State post office, a flourishing school with 300 pupils, a police station, a dispensary, and a public works inspection bungalow are situated in the town. The Canadian Presbyterian Mission has an out-station here.\n\nJaw\u0101di.\u2014Hill range in North Arcot District, Madras. See Jav\u0101di.\n\nJaw\u0101la Mukhi.\u2014Ancient site in the Dera Gopipur tahsil of Kangra District, Punjab, situated in 31\u00b0 52' N. and 76\u00b0 20' E., on the road from Kangra town to N\u0101daun, at the foot of a precipitous range of hills, which forms the northern limit of the Be\u0101s valley. Population (1901), 1,021. Once a considerable and opulent town, as its ruins testify, it is now chiefly famous for the temple of the goddess Jaw\u0101la Mukhi, 'she of the flaming mouth,' which lies in the Be\u0101s valley and is built over some natural jets of combustible gas, believed to be a manifestation of the goddess Dev\u012b. Another legend avers that the flames proceed from the mouth of the demon Jal\u0101ndhara, the Daitya king whom Siva overwhelmed with mountains, and who gives his name to the Jullundur Do\u0101b. The building is modern, with a gilt dome and pinnacles, and possesses a beautiful folding door of silver plates, presented by the Sikh R\u0101j\u0101, Kharak Singh. The interior of the temple consists of a square pit about 3 feet deep, with a pathway all round. In the middle the rock is slightly hollowed out about the principal fissure, and on applying a light the gas bursts into flame. The gas escapes at several other points from the crevices of the walls of the pit. It collects very slowly, and the attendant Br\u0101hmans, when pilgrims are numerous, keep up the flames with ghi. There is no idol of any kind, the flaming fissure being considered as the fiery mouth of the goddess, whose headless body is said to be in the temple of Bhawan. The income of the temple, which is considerable, belongs to the Bhojki priests. At one time the Katoch R\u0101j\u0101s appear to have appropriated the whole or the greater part of the receipts; and under Muhammadan rule a poll-tax of one anna\nwas levied upon all pilgrims. The number of these in the course of the year is very great; and at the principal festival in September\u2013October as many as 50,000 are said to congregate, many coming from great distances. Another festival of scarcely less importance takes place in March. Six hot mineral springs, impregnated with common salt and iodide of potassium, are found in the neighbourhood. A sarai erected by the R\u0101j\u0101 of Pati\u0101la is attached to the temple, and there are also eight dharms\u0101las or resthouses for travellers. The temple was slightly damaged by the earthquake of April 4, 1905. The municipality was abolished in 1885.\n\nJaw\u0101si\u0101.\u2014Thakur\u012bt in the M\u0101lw\u0101 Agency, Central India.\n\nJawh\u0101r.\u2014State situated within the geographical limits of Th\u0101na District, Bombay, between 19\u00b0 40\u2032 and 20\u00b0 4\u2032 N. and 73\u00b0 2\u2032 and 73\u00b0 23\u2032 E., with an area of 310 square miles. Jawh\u0101r State consists of two unequal patches of territory, the larger in the north-eastern part of Th\u0101na District, and the smaller in the north-western. The Bombay, Baroda, and Central India Railway just touches the western boundary of the smaller patch.\n\nMost of Jawh\u0101r is a plateau raised about 1,000 feet above the Konkan plain. Eastward the Western Gh\u0101ts can be crossed by pack-bullocks through the Chinchut\u0101ra and Gonde passes to the north, and through the Dhondm\u0101re and Shir passes to the south, of the high hill of Vatvad. The westerly route, about 38 miles from Jawh\u0101r to D\u0101h\u0101nu Road on the Bombay, Baroda, and Central India Railway, crosses the Kas\u0101tw\u0101di and Deng passes by a metalled road built by the Government in 1872-4. The road has recently been farther extended by the State eastwards to Kelghar. Towards the south and west the country is in some places level; but the rest of the territory is elevated, and consists of the rocky and forest-covered tract that everywhere lies at the western foot of the Gh\u0101ts. Though its many fertile valleys contain numerous streams, their waters are not used for irrigation. The chief streams are the Deharji, the Surya, the Pinjali, and the V\u0101gh. Except in the southern mah\u0101l of Malv\u0101da, the water-supply fails as the hot season advances. Between June and October the rainfall is heavy, the average for the year being 120 inches. From the close of the rainy season till the end of December the air retains a considerable degree of moisture. In January and February the dryness and heat increase, followed from March to June by a tolerably warm season. The temperature rises to 106\u00b0 in May and falls to 66\u00b0 in January. During the greater part of the year the climate is malarious and unhealthy.\n\nUp to 1294, the period of the first Muhammadan invasion of the Deccan, Jawh\u0101r was held by a V\u0101rli, not a Koli, chief. The first Koli chief, Paupera, otherwise known as Jayaba, obtained his footing in Jawh\u0101r by a device similar to that of Dido, when she asked for and received as much land as the hide of a bull would cover. The Koli\nchief cut his hide into strips, and thus enclosed the territory of the State. Jayaba was succeeded by his son Nim Sh\u0101h, on whom the king of Delhi conferred the title of R\u0101j\u0101. So important was this event in the history of Jawh\u0101r that June 5, 1343, the day on which the title was received, has been made the beginning of a new era, which is still used in public documents. The Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d Sult\u0101ns, who held the sea-coast of Th\u0101na, interfered but little with the inland portion of Jawh\u0101r: but with the Portuguese a continuous struggle was waged, which lasted until the decay of the latter, when the Jawh\u0101r chief, aided by alliances with the Mughal generals, managed to plunder the Portuguese possessions in the North Konkan and extend his territory from Bassein to D\u0101h\u0101nu. Subsequently the Mar\u0101th\u0101s, who attacked the State on several occasions, deprived the chief of part of his territory and forced him to pay tribute. The succession to the chiefship follows the rule of primogeniture; a sanad granting the right of adoption on failure of natural heirs was granted in 1890. Except the nazar\u0101na, or succession fee in case of adoption, the R\u0101j\u0101 pays no tribute to Government.\n\nSince 1872 the population of the State has increased by 27 per cent. According to the Census of 1901, the population was 47,538, of whom 47,007 were Hindus and 471 Muhammadans, the density being 153 persons per square mile. The State contains 108 villages, the only important one being that from which the State takes its name, situated in $19^\\circ 56' N.$ and $73^\\circ 16' E.$, with 3,567 inhabitants. Jawh\u0101r village is healthy and fairly cool, standing 1,500 feet above sea-level. The only place of interest in the State is the ruined fort of Bhopatgarh, about 10 miles south-east of Jawh\u0101r village.\n\nThe soil, except in the level tracts, is stony and unsuited for the better class of crops. Of the total area, 69 square miles are under forest and 58 are uncultivable, 171 square miles are cultivable, and 159 were cropped in 1903\u20134. Besides timber, the country yields rice to a limited extent and the coarser grains abundantly. The State escaped the famine that affected the rest of the Presidency in 1899\u20131902, but it suffered rather severely from the depredations of locusts in 1903\u20134. The export trade consists of teak, rice, and n\u0101gli. Good building stone is found.\n\nJawh\u0101r is under the political control of the Collector of Th\u0101na. The chief decides Sessions cases and hears appeals, and has power to try his own subjects for capital offences. The land is held to belong to the State, but so long as the owner pays his rent he cannot be ousted. The land revenue formerly varied in different parts of the State, but the settlement, completed in 1887\u20138, has fixed rates per acre varying from $2\\frac{1}{2}$ annas to Rs. $5\\frac{1}{2}$. The revenue of the State in 1903\u20134 was about 1.7 lakhs, of which Rs. 50,000 accrued from land, Rs. 29,000 from excise, and Rs. 3,000 from forests. The expenditure amounted to\nover one lakh. The State pays no tribute, and the levy of transit dues was abolished in 1881. Control over opium has been ceded to the British, to whom also the excise arrangements are farmed. No military force is maintained. The police number 45. The State possesses two schools, with an average daily attendance of 132 pupils. The State dispensary, opened in 1878, annually treats 3,000 patients. About 1,500 persons are annually vaccinated in the State.\n\nJaynagar Village.\u2014Village in the Madhubani subdivision of Darbhanga District, Bengal, situated in $26^\\circ 35' N.$ and $86^\\circ 9' E.$, a few miles south of the Nep\u0101l frontier, and a little east of the river Kaml\u0101. Population (1901), 3,551. The village contains a mud fort attributed to Al\u0101-ud-din, king of Bengal (1493\u20131518), and said to have been constructed to resist the incursions of the hill tribes. Near the fort is an encampment made by the British during the Nep\u0101l War.\n\nJaynagar Town.\u2014Town in the head-quarters subdivision of the District of the Twenty-four Parganas, Bengal, situated in $22^\\circ 11' N.$ and $88^\\circ 25' E.$, 31 miles south of Calcutta and $6\\frac{1}{2}$ miles by water from Magr\u0101 H\u0101t station on the Eastern Bengal State Railway. Population (1901), 8,810. Jaynagar was constituted a municipality in 1869. The average income and expenditure during the decade ending 1901\u20132 were Rs. 6,100. In 1903\u20134 the income was Rs. 7,600, mainly from a tax on persons (or property tax); and the expenditure was Rs. 7,300.\n\nJech Do\u0101b.\u2014Do\u0101b in the Punjab. See Chaj Do\u0101b.\n\nJedcherla.\u2014Former t\u0101luk in the north of Mahb\u016bbnagar District, Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State, with an area of 9.46 square miles. The population in 1901, including j\u0101g\u012brs, was 96,886, compared with 96,106 in 1891. The land revenue in 1901 was Rs. 80,000. In 1905 the t\u0101luk was divided between Mahb\u016bbnagar, Pargi, and Kalvakurti. The j\u0101g\u012br t\u0101luk of Changomal lies to the south, with a population of 12,480 and 22 villages, and an area of about 106 square miles. It has now been transferred to the Pargi t\u0101luk.\n\nJehlam.\u2014District, tahs\u012bl, river, and town in the Punjab. See Jhelum.\n\nJejuri.\u2014Town in the Purandhar t\u0101luka of Poona District, Bombay, situated in $18^\\circ 16' N.$ and $74^\\circ 9' E.$, on the Southern Mahratta Railway. Population (1901), 2,871. It is a place of Hindu pilgrimage. The municipality was established in 1868, to take charge of the sanitary arrangements during the religious fairs to which the village owes its importance. The fairs are in honour of the god Khandoba. A pilgrim tax is levied for four months, from about December to April. The average income during the decade ending 1901 was Rs. 5,000. In 1903\u20134 the income was Rs. 4,700. The town contains a dispensary and a school, managed by the Poona Native Institution, with 182 boys and 9 girls.\nJelep La.\u2014Pass in the Chola range of the Him\u0101layas, situated in 27\u00b0 22' N. and 88\u00b0 53' E., leading from Sikkim State, Bengal, into the Chumbi valley of Tibet. Height, 14,390 feet above sea-level. The Jelep pass forms the principal route by which Tibetan trade enters British India, and carries about half of the total registered trade between India and Tibet.\n\nJell\u0101l\u0101b\u0101d,\u2014Province and town in Afgh\u0101nist\u0101n.

See Jaleswar.\n\nJesar.\u2014Petty State in Rew\u0101 K\u0101nth\u0101, Bombay.\n\nJessore District (Yasohara).\u2014District of the Presidency Division, Bengal, lying between 22\u00b0 47' and 23\u00b0 47' N. and 88\u00b0 40' and 89\u00b0 50' E., with an area of 2,925 square miles. It is bounded on the north and west by Nadi\u0101 District; on the south by Khuln\u0101; and on the east by the Madhumati and B\u0101r\u0101sia rivers, which separate it from Far\u012bdpur.\n\nJessore forms the central portion of the delta between the Hooghly and the Meghn\u0101 estuary, and is an alluvial plain intersected by rivers and watercourses, which in parts of the south of the District spread out into large marshes. The river system was formerly supplied by the Padm\u0101, and the rivers for the most part flowed across the District from the north-west to the south-east. The north-west of the District was gradually raised by their periodical inundations till their connexions with the Padm\u0101 silted up; and the rivers, with the sole exception of the Garai, which with its continuation the Madhumati is still an important offshoot of that river, ceased to be running streams, their beds degenerating into stagnant marshes during the greater part of the year. The District, entirely a fluvial formation, is thus naturally divided into two parts: the thickly populated country to the north, now raised by continual deposits beyond the reach of the inundations by which it was previously affected, declining towards the south into swampy tracts, where the rivers are tidal and the only parts suitable for habitation are the high lands along their banks. The principal rivers, which are connected with one another by numerous cross-channels, are the Garai and the Madhumati to the east, and proceeding from north to south, the Kum\u0101r, Nabagang\u0101, Chitra, Kabadak, Bhairab, and Ich\u0101mati. The last-mentioned rivers, which were originally distributaries of the Padm\u0101, have now largely silted up in their upper reaches, and are in many cases entirely cut off from their parent stream. The Kum\u0101r, a branch of the Mat\u0101bh\u0101nga, discharges into the Nabagang\u0101 at M\u0101gura; it is also connected with the Madhumati by the Little B\u0101r\u0101sia. The Nabagang\u0101, also formerly an offshoot of the Mat\u0101bh\u0101nga, no longer gets any flood discharge from that river, and boat traffic is impracticable beyond Jhenida, while between Jhenida and M\u0101gura it is navigable only for about three months in the year.\nThe silting-up process has extended as far south as Binodpur, below which it is navigable throughout the year. The Nabagang\u0101 formerly joined the Madhumati near Loh\u0101gar\u0101, but the connexion has silted up and its waters now flow down the B\u0101nk\u0101na; this river divides into two branches at Patna, the eastern branch which flows into the Madhumati being known as the K\u0101lia or G\u0101ngn\u012b river, while the western branch continues to be called the B\u0101nk\u0101na. The Kabadak, formerly an offshoot of the M\u0101t\u0101bh\u0101nga, has silted up in its upper portion, but is navigable below Kotch\u0101ndpur by large boats throughout the year. The Bhairab, which leaves the Kabadak on its left bank above T\u0101hirpur, has similarly silted up in its upper reaches, the channel above Jessore being practically only a line of marshes. The Majud kh\u0101li Kh\u0101l brings down some of the waters of the Chitr\u0101 to the Bhairab at Simultala, and the Bhairab is also connected with the Chitr\u0101 by the Gobra-Afra Kh\u0101l. The Ich\u0101mat\u012b, which flows across the south-west corner of the District, is navigable in this part of its course throughout the year.\n\nThe District is covered by recent alluvial deposits, consisting of sandy clay and sand along the course of the rivers, and fine silt consolidating into clay in the flatter parts of the river plain, where beds of impure peat also occur. Sand is found in large quantities only along the banks and ch\u0101rs of the Madhumati.\n\nThe stretches of low-lying land under rice cultivation afford a foothold for various marsh species, while the numerous ponds and ditches are filled with submerged and floating water-plants. Remarkable among these for its rarity, and interesting on account of its distribution to Europe on the one hand and Australia on the other, is the floating Aldrovanda vesiculosa. The edges of sluggish creeks are lined with large sedges and bulrushes, and the banks of rivers have a hedge-like scrub jungle. The sides of embankments and village sites, where not occupied by habitations, are densely covered with shrubberies of semi-spontaneous species, interspersed with clumps of planted bamboos and groves of Areca, Moringa, Mangifera, and Anona. The babul (Acacia arabica) also grows in great abundance, and the banyan (Ficus indica), pipal (Ficus religiosa), tamarind (Tamarindus indica), and mulberry reach a large size. The north and east of the District are dotted with numerous groves of date-palms (Phoenix acauulis); and many of the principal roads are lined with fine avenues of banyans, casuarinas (Casuarina muricata), and mulberry-trees. Waysides and waste places are filled with grasses and weeds, usually of little intrinsic interest but often striking because of their distribution; many of them have been inadvertently introduced by human agency, and include European or African and American species. There are no forests in the District.\n\nLeopards were formerly common, and wild hog are still very\nnumerous in some parts of the District. The latter do great damage to growing crops, especially to sugar-cane.\n\nThe mean temperature for the year is $74^\\circ$. The mean minimum rises from $53^\\circ$ in January to $79^\\circ$ in June, at which point it remains constant until September; the mean maximum is highest ($97^\\circ$) in April. The annual rainfall averages 60 inches, of which 7 fall in May, 11.3 in June, 10.4 in July, 10.7 in August, and 7.7 in September.\n\nThe country once formed a portion of the old kingdom of Banga or Samatata, but the earliest traditions still current are associated with the name of Kh\u00e4nja Ali, who came to the District four and a half centuries ago. He obtained a j\u0101g\u012br from the king of Gaur and made extensive clearances in the Sundarbans, where he appears to have exercised all the rights of sovereignty till his death in 1459. He left numerous mosques and tombs, but most of these are in Khuln\u0101 District. The next traditions are connected with R\u0101j\u0101 Vikram\u0101ditya, one of the chief ministers of Daud Kh\u0101n, the last king of Bengal, who obtained a grant in the Sundarbans and established a city to which he retired with his family and dependants. The vernacular name of the District is a corruption of Yasohara ('glory depriving,' as it is said to have robbed Gaur of its pre-eminence), the name given by Vikram\u0101ditya to his capital city, the site of which was at Iswaripur in Khuln\u0101 District. Vikram\u0101ditya was succeeded by his son Prat\u0101p\u0101ditya, the popular hero of the Sundarbans, who gained predominance over the twelve chiefs or Bhuiy\u0101s who then held the south and east of Bengal; he was eventually defeated and captured by R\u0101j\u0101 M\u0101n Singh, the Hindu leader of Akbar's armies in Bengal from 1589 to 1606. The name Jessore continued to attach itself to the estates which Prat\u0101p\u0101ditya had possessed. The military governor, who had charge of them, and who was located at Mirz\u0101ngar on the Kabadak, was called the Faujd\u0101r of Jessore; and when the headquarters of the District were brought to Kasb\u0101 (where they now are), the name Jessore was applied to the town where the courts were located. Until 1786 the District was still nearly conterminous with R\u0101j\u0101 Prat\u0101p\u0101ditya's territories; but since that date large areas have from time to time been shorn away, and at the present day it covers barely one-half of its original area.\n\nAfter the fall of R\u0101j\u0101 Prat\u0101p\u0101ditya those of his parganas which were situated within the present area of this District were divided into three zamind\u0101ris, that in the south being held by the R\u0101j\u0101 of Jessore, known as the Ch\u0101nchra R\u0101j\u0101, and that in the north by the R\u0101j\u0101 of Nald\u0101nga, while the third, called the zamind\u0101ri of Bhushan\u0101, fell into the hands of R\u0101j\u0101 S\u016bta Ram Rai, concerning whom there are numerous legends in the north-east of the District. He was a talukd\u0101r of a village called Hariharnagar on the bank of the Madhumati river, and is said to have\nbeen deputed by the Naw\u0101b of Dacca to collect his revenues; but as the revenues never went farther than S\u012bt\u0101 R\u0101m himself, the Naw\u0101b sent an army against him and at length succeeded in capturing him about the year 1712. The ruins of S\u012bt\u0101 R\u0101m\u2019s palace and the various large tanks which he constructed are still to be seen at Muhammadpur.\n\nThe R\u0101j\u0101s of Jessore or Ch\u0101nchra trace their origin to Bh\u0101beswar Rai, a soldier in the army of an imperial general, who conferred on him several parganas taken from Prat\u0101p\u0101ditya. He died in 1588, and was succeeded by his son Maht\u0101b R\u0101m Rai, who assisted M\u0101n Singh against Prat\u0101p\u0101ditya, and at the close of the war was allowed to retain the parganas made over to his father. To him succeeded Kandarpa Rai, who added considerably to the estate; and he in turn was followed by Manohar Rai (1649\u20131705), who is regarded as the principal founder of the family. The estate, when he inherited it, was of moderate size; but he acquired one pargana after another, until, at his death, the property was by far the largest in the neighbourhood. The estate then went to Krishna R\u0101m, who was followed by Sukh Deb Rai (1729\u201345). The latter divided the estate into a three-quarters share and a one-quarter share, the former being called the Isafpur and the latter the Saidpur estate. The latter was given by Sukh Deb to his brother Syam Sund\u0101r, who died without issue, leaving it vacant. It was afterwards conferred by the East India Company upon a landholder in exchange for certain lands near Calcutta. The possessor of the property in 1814, H\u0101ji Muhammad Mohsin, made over the estate in trust for the Hooghly Im\u0101mb\u0101ra, which has ever since enjoyed its revenues. Isafpur estate was inherited in 1764 by Sr\u012b Kanta Rai, who sustained such heavy losses about the time of the Permanent Settlement, that his family was left destitute and forced to fall back upon the bounty of the Government. His grandson, Barad\u0101 Kant\u0101, who succeeded in 1817, being a minor, the property was administered by the Court of Wards, and its value greatly increased. In 1823 the Government added to his estate the confiscated pargana of S\u0101hos, and subsequently bestowed on Barad\u0101 Kant\u0101 the title of R\u0101j\u0101 Bah\u0101dur in recognition of services rendered by him during the Mutiny. He died in 1880, leaving three sons, the eldest of whom succeeded to the title and estates.\n\nThe revenue or financial administration (diw\u0101ni) was transferred to the East India Company with that of the rest of Bengal in 1765; but it was not until 1781, when a court was opened at Murali near Jessore town, that British administration was completely established in the District. The first Judge and Magistrate was Mr. Henckell, who founded a market still known as Henckellganj, and was the first to urge upon the Government the scheme of Sundarbans reclamation (see Sundarbans). Mr. Rocke, who succeeded him in 1789, trans-\nferred the civil station to Jessore, where it still remains. Among the Collectors of Jessore was Mr. R. Thackeray, father of the novelist, who acted in that capacity for a few months in 1805. The boundaries of the District have undergone frequent changes: extensive areas on the east and south have been taken away to form the Districts of Faridpur and Khuln\u0101, while additions have been made from the Twenty-four Parganas and Nadi\u0101 on the west.\n\nThe population of the present area was returned at 1,451,507 in 1872 and 1,939,375 in 1881, but it fell to 1,888,827 in 1891 and 1,813,155 in 1901. The apparent increase in 1881 was probably caused by the inaccuracy of the first Census; the subsequent decline is due to the extremely insanitary conditions which prevail. The banks of the rivers are higher than the country behind them, and depressions are thus formed between the main watercourses. The drainage of these was always difficult, and it has now become almost impossible owing to the silting up of the mouths of the rivers and drainage channels. Stagnant swamps are thus formed, while good drinking-water is scarce, and the homesteads are enveloped in dense jungle. It was in this District that cholera appeared in a violently epidemic form in 1817. Here, too, twenty years later, originated that terribly fatal kind of fever subsequently known as 'Nadi\u0101,' and then as 'Burdw\u0101n fever,' which decimated the population of the country from Jessore westwards as far as the Bishnupur subdivision of B\u0101nkura. The first known outbreak occurred near Muhammadpur among a body of some 600 prisoners working on the road from Jessore to Dacca. In 1843 the epidemic seemed to disappear, but it again broke out in 1846. At the present time this malignant type of fever is not noticeable; but a milder form is very prevalent, which is relentlessly at work, destroying many and sapping the vitality of the survivors and reducing their fecundity. Cholera is also prevalent, and small-pox, dysentery, and diarrhoea claim many victims.\n\nThe chief statistics of the Census of 1901 are shown below:\n\n| Subdivision | Area in square miles | Number of Towns | Villages | Population | Population per square mile | Percentage of variation in population between 1891 and 1901 | Number of persons able to read and write |\n|-------------|---------------------|----------------|---------|------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Jessore     | 889                 | 1              | 1,488   | 561,242    | 631                       | - 5\u00b76                                           | 37,616                                 |\n| Jhenida     | 475                 | 1              | 864     | 304,899    | 642                       | - 2\u00b73                                           | 14,893                                 |\n| M\u0101gura      | 425                 | ...            | 934     | 277,381    | 653                       | - 8\u00b75                                           | 12,538                                 |\n| Nar\u0101l       | 487                 | ...            | 810     | 352,281    | 723                       | + 1\u00b71                                           | 24,126                                 |\n| Bangaon     | 649                 | 1              | 798     | 317,352    | 489                       | - 3\u00b79                                           | 15,929                                 |\n| District total | 2,925             | 3              | 4,894   | 1,813,155  | 620                       | - 4\u00b70                                           | 105,102                                |\nThe three towns are Jessore, the head-quarters, Kotchandpur, and Mahespur; but they are all small (only 1 per cent. of the population being urban), and have all lost ground since 1891, though Kotchandpur has a considerable trade. The population is densest in the east, where the soil is most fertile and still receives occasional deposits of silt, and most scattered in the Bangaon subdivision to the west. The decadence already referred to is most marked in the country running west and south-west from the Muhammadpur th\u0101na on the eastern boundary, the centre of both epidemic cholera and of the 'Burdwan fever.' This unhealthy zone stretches eastwards and northwards beyond the Jessore boundary, and includes the north-western part of Faridpur and a small area in the north-west of Khuln\u0101. There is little migration except to and from the surrounding Districts. The language of the District is Bengali, the dialects spoken being the Eastern or Musalm\u0101n\u012b, and Central Bengali. Of the population, 61 per cent. are Muhammadans and 39 per cent. Hindus.\n\nThe majority of the Muhammadans are Shaikhs (984,000), who are probably in the main the descendants of converts from the aboriginal Namas\u016bdras. This is the most numerous Hindu caste (175,000); but K\u0101yasths (55,000), Much\u012bs (48,000), Kaibarttas (45,000), Br\u0101hmans (39,000), M\u0101l\u014ds (27,000), Ahirs and Go\u0101l\u0101s (26,000), and S\u0101h\u0101s (24,000) are also well represented. A noted colony of Kulin Br\u0101hmans resides at Lakshm\u012bp\u0101sa. Agriculture supports 71 per cent. of the population, industries 15 per cent., commerce 0.6 per cent., and the professions 1.9 per cent.\n\nChristians in 1901 numbered 912, of whom 867 were natives. The Baptist Missionary Society, the London Missionary Society, and a Roman Catholic mission are at work in this District: of these the Roman Catholic and Baptist missions have secured most converts.\n\nThe soil is fertile, but the northern part no longer receives the annual deposit of silt which used to enrich it. Here aus or autumn rice is the principal staple, but tobacco, sugar-cane, and various cold-season crops are also grown. The low country in the south is chiefly under rice cultivation, \u0101man or winter rice predominating. Date-palms are largely grown for the manufacture of sugar. They commence bearing when they are about seven years old, and continue to bear for about twenty-five years. The juice is collected from November to February, the yield of gur being about 15 to 20 seers per tree. Indigo was formerly extensively cultivated; but a large number of factories were closed in consequence of the disturbances of 1859\u201361 (of which some account will be found in the article on Nadia District), and its cultivation has now almost entirely disappeared. Cultivation has suffered much in the Jhenida subdivision from the drying up of the rivers; in the M\u0101gura subdivision the area\nunder *aman* rice is contrasting owing to deficient floods, but that of *aus* and jute is extending. There is no artificial irrigation.\n\nThe principal agricultural statistics for 1903\u20134 are shown below, areas being in square miles:\n\n| Subdivision | Total | Cultivated | Cultivable waste |\n|-------------|-------|------------|------------------|\n| Jessore     | 889   | 506        | 24               |\n| Jhenida     | 475   | 309        | 15               |\n| M\u0101gura      | 425   | 268        | 16               |\n| Nar\u0101l       | 487   | 389        | 18               |\n| Bangaon     | 649   | 389        | 14               |\n| **Total**   | **2,925** | **1,861** | **87**           |\n\nOf the cultivated area it is estimated that 168 square miles are twice cropped. Rice is grown on 1,391 square miles. *Aman* rice is sown in April and May, and reaped in November or December; the land for this crop is usually ploughed four times before sowing, and except in marsh lands the young shoots are transplanted in July. For *aus* rice the ground is ploughed five or six times and the seed is sown broadcast; the land on which it is grown generally yields a cold-season crop as well. *Boro* rice land is hardly ploughed at all; the seed is scattered broadcast in the marshes as they dry up, and the shoots are transplanted when a month old, and sometimes again a month later. Other crops grown are gram (26 square miles), pulses, &c., (198 square miles), oilseeds, including mustard, linseed, and *til* (*Sesamum indicum*) (162 square miles), sugar-cane (15 square miles), jute (48 square miles), and tobacco (32 square miles). On the occasion of the scarcity in the M\u0101gura subdivision in 1897\u20138, Rs. 64,000 was advanced under the Agriculturists\u2019 Loans Act.\n\nThe cattle are poor. There are no regular pasture-lands, but cattle are grazed on the banks of marshes and in the date-palm orchards.\n\nCoarse cotton cloths are woven on hand-looms throughout the District. Mats and baskets, made by the Much\u012bs and Doms, have a large local sale. Cart-wheels are extensively made; those prepared in the Jhenida subdivision are largely sold at B\u0101duri\u0101 in the Twenty-four Parganas.\n\nTrade and communications. Lime for white-washing and for eating with *p\u0101n* is prepared by Baitis from shells collected in the marshes by women of the B\u0101gdi caste. Gold and silver ornaments and iron and brass-ware are manufactured. Lac bracelets are made at Loh\u0101gar\u0101 by immigrants from the United Provinces. The date-palm sugar industry is of local importance, but is gradually declining in spite of the imposition of countervailing duties on imported sugar; in 1900\u20131 there were 117 factories, with an out-turn of 235,000 maunds, valued at 15\u00b715 lakhs.\nThe principal imports are rice and sundri wood (*Heritiera littoralis*) from Backergunge and the Sundarbans; cotton piece-goods, cotton twist, salt, kerosene oil, flour, and potatoes from Calcutta; and coal from Burdwan. The principal exports are paddy, pulses, jute, linseed, tamarind, coco-nuts, unrefined sugar, oil-cake, hides, earthen jars, cart-wheels, bamboos, bones, betel-nuts, timber, *gh\u012b*, and fish, chiefly to Backergunge and Calcutta. Except in the Jhenida subdivision, where there is a large amount of cart traffic, most of the trade is carried by boats and is in the hands of S\u0101h\u0101 and Teli dealers; but considerable quantities of jute and bamboos are sent by rail to Calcutta. Kotchandpur is the largest and Kesabpur the second largest centre of trade; Naldanga, Chaugacha, M\u0101gura, Jhenida, Chandkhali, Khajura, and Binodpur are important trading villages.\n\nThe central section of the Eastern Bengal State Railway connects Calcutta with Jessore, the head-quarters station, whence it runs southeast to Khuln\u0101. This line is connected with the eastern section of the same railway by a branch from Bangaon to R\u0101n\u0101gh\u0101t. Excluding village tracks, the District contains 581 miles of roads, of which 117 miles are metalled; the most important are the Provincial road from Jessore to Calcutta, and those connecting Jessore with Kesabpur and Jhenida, K\u0101liganj with Hansada, and Jhenida with Borai and M\u0101gura. Road communication is best in the higher land in the head-quarters, Jhenida, and Bangaon subdivisions, where the silting up of the water communications has rendered them more necessary than elsewhere. There are 45 ferries.\n\nThe rivers are in many cases no longer navigable in their upper reaches except during the rains, but lower down they are tidal, and carry large boats and small steamers throughout the year. Steamer services ply on alternate weekdays from Khuln\u0101 up the Ath\u0101rab\u0101nki and Madhumati as far as Muhammadpur; daily from Khuln\u0101 by K\u0101lia to Loh\u0101gar\u0101, and by the Majudkh\u0101li-Chitr\u0101-Ghor\u0101kh\u0101li Kh\u0101l and the Nabagang\u0101 to Binodpur throughout the year and during the rains as far as M\u0101gura; and on alternate weekdays from Kapilmuni up the Kabadak to Kotchandpur, feeding the railway at Jhingerg\u0101cha. During the rains boats ranging up to 2,000 maunds carry jute to the stations on the railway, while some go direct to Calcutta. Large passenger-boats ply on the Nabagang\u0101 and Chitr\u0101 rivers and on the channels connecting them with the railway stations.\n\nThere has been no famine in Jessore in recent times; but there was some scarcity in the M\u0101gura subdivision in 1897, when rice sold at 7\u00bd seers to the rupee. Advances were made under the Agriculturists' Loans Act, but Government relief was only necessary on a small scale.\n\nFor administrative purposes the District is divided into five subdivi-\nsions, with head-quarters at Jessore, Jhenida, M\u0101gura, Nar\u0101l, and Bangaon. The Magistrate-Collector is assisted at head-quarters by a staff of five Deputy-Magistrate-Collectors; the subdivisions of M\u0101gura, Nar\u0101l, and Bangaon are in charge of Deputy-Magistrate-Collectors, while the subdivisional officer of Jhenida is usually a Joint-Magistrate. The subdivisional officers of Bangaon, Jhenida, and Nar\u0101l are occasionally assisted by Sub-Deputy-Collectors.\n\nThe civil courts subordinate to the District and Sessions Judge, who is also Judge of Khuln\u0101, are those of a Sub-Judge and four Munsifs at Jessore, three Munsifs at Nar\u0101l, and two each at Jhenida, M\u0101gura, and Bangaon. The total number of criminal courts is twenty-three, including an Additional Sessions Judge, who is also employed for part of the year at Khuln\u0101. The District had at one time an unenviable reputation for dacoity, but this is no longer the case. Petty riots arising out of land disputes are common.\n\nAt the settlement of Todar Mal the greater part of the District was included in sark\u0101r Kh\u0101l\u012bfat\u0101b\u0101d, but a small portion in the north-east formed part of sark\u0101r Mu\u1e25ammad\u0101b\u0101d or Bh\u016bshan\u0101. The District was subsequently divided chiefly among the great zam\u012bnd\u0101ris of Isafpur, Saidpur, and Mu\u1e25ammadsh\u0101hi. The revenue administration was assumed by the British in 1772, but a Collectorate was not established till 1786, prior to which date the land revenue head-quarters were at Calcutta. Owing to the continuous changes of fiscal jurisdiction, comparison of the land revenue with that formerly paid is impossible. The present incidence amounts to only R. 0\u201311\u20132 per cultivated acre. Subdivision of property has gone on rapidly under British rule, and there are now 2,444 permanently settled estates, in addition to 70 small estates which are temporarily settled, and 85 held direct by Government. Sub-infeudation of holdings has also been carried on to an enormous extent. The average rate of rent is Rs. 2\u201315\u20134 per cultivated acre, but the amount varies according to the crops for which the land is suitable. The rates for rice land range from Rs. 1\u20138 to Rs. 12 per acre, for jute from Rs. 2\u201310 to Rs. 2\u201313, pulses and oilseeds from Rs. 3 to Rs. 4\u20138, sugar-cane from Rs. 3 to Rs. 7\u20138, vegetables from Rs. 3 to Rs. 9, date-palms from Rs. 3\u20133 to Rs. 9, betel and coco-nut palms from Rs. 10 to Rs. 16, and p\u0101n gardens from Rs. 8 to Rs. 20, while homestead land fetches Rs. 10 to Rs. 15, and garden land Rs. 10 to Rs. 20 per acre. Rents are lowest in the less fertile Bangaon subdivision, where the maximum rate for rice lands is Rs. 3 per acre. The average quantity of land held by each ryot is 8 acres. The utbandi system (see N\u0101di\u0101 District) prevails in some parts of the District; korf\u0101 ryots, who hold land under a middleman, are numerous.\nThe following table shows the collections of land revenue and of total revenue (principal heads only), in thousands of rupees:\n\n|                | 1880-1 | 1890-1 | 1900-1 | 1903-4 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Land revenue   | 10.84  | 8.69   | 8.60   | 8.54   |\n| Total revenue  | 18.88  | 15.42  | 16.92  | 16.89  |\n\n* In 1880-1 the District did not include the subdivision of Bangaon, which was subsequently transferred to it from Nadia.\n\nOutside the municipalities of Jessore, Kotchandpur, and Mahespur, local affairs are managed by the District board, with subordinate local boards in each subdivision. In 1903-4 the income of the District board was Rs. 1,70,000, of which Rs. 99,000 was derived from rates; and the expenditure was Rs. 1,68,000. Schemes for the reclamation of the river Bhairab, a standing source of unhealthiness, and for opening the Muchikh\u0101li Kh\u0101l are under contemplation. The Halifax Canal, one mile in length, excavated in 1901, connects the Madhumati and Nabaganga rivers in the Nar\u0101l subdivision.\n\nThe District contains 20 police stations and 10 outposts; and in 1903 the force subordinate to the District Superintendent consisted of 5 inspectors, 43 sub-inspectors, 36 head constables, and 421 constables (including 38 town chaukid\u0101rs and water police). In addition, there is a rural force of 245 daffad\u0101rs and 3,839 chaukid\u0101rs. The District jail at Jessore has accommodation for 370 prisoners, and subsidiary jails at each of the subdivisional out-stations for 106.\n\nThe District is less advanced in respect of education than would be expected from its proximity to Calcutta, and in 1901 only 5.8 per cent. of the population (11 males and 0.5 females) could read and write. The number of pupils under instruction was 34,000 in 1892-3 and 35,000 in 1900-1. In 1903-4, 43,000 boys and 4,000 girls were at school, being respectively 31.1 and 2.6 per cent. of the children of school-going age. The number of educational institutions, public and private, in that year was 1,367, including an Arts college, 85 secondary, 1,255 primary, and 26 special schools. The expenditure on education was 2.1 lakhs, of which Rs. 23,000 was met from Provincial funds, Rs. 41,000 from District funds, Rs. 600 from municipal funds, and 1 lakh from fees. The principal educational institutions are the Victoria College at Nar\u0101l and high schools at K\u0101lia, M\u0101gura, and Jessore town.\n\nIn 1903 the District contained 12 dispensaries, of which 5 had accommodation for 30 in-patients. At these the cases of 62,000 out-patients and 500 in-patients were treated during the year, and 2,000 operations were performed. The expenditure was Rs. 19,000, of which Rs. 1,700 was met by a Government subvention, Rs. 7,000 from Local and Rs. 3,000 from municipal funds, and Rs. 8,000 from subscriptions.\nVaccination is compulsory only in municipal areas. During 1903-4 the number of persons successfully vaccinated was 54,000, representing 29.9 per 1,000 of the population.\n\n[Sir W. W. Hunter, *Statistical Account of Bengal*, vols. i and ii (1875); Sir J. Westland, *Report on Jessore* (Calcutta, 1874).]\n\n**Jessore Subdivision.**\u2014Head-quarters subdivision of Jessore District, Bengal, lying between 22\u00b0 47' and 23\u00b0 28' N. and 88\u00b0 59' and 89\u00b0 26' E., with an area of 889 square miles. The subdivision is an alluvial tract, containing some large marshes and traversed by streams which have now silted up except in the lower reaches. The population in 1901 was 561,242, compared with 594,835 in 1891, the density being 631 persons per square mile. It contains one town, Jessore (population, 8,054), the head-quarters; and 1,488 villages. The principal marts are at Basantia, Jessore town, Jhingergacha, and Kesabpur.\n\n**Jessore Town.**\u2014Head-quarters of Jessore District, Bengal, situated in 23\u00b0 10' N. and 89\u00b0 13' E., on the Bhairab river, and on the Eastern Bengal State Railway, 74 miles from Calcutta and 35 miles from Khulna. Population (1901), 8,054. The name was applied to the village of Kasba when it was made the head-quarters of the District. The villages of Purana, Kasba, Bagchhar, Sankarpur, and Chanchra lie within the municipal limits. The last contains the residence of the Rajas of Chanchra or Jessore (*see Jessore District*), and the remains of a rampart and fosse by which it was once surrounded are still visible. Jessore was constituted a municipality in 1864. The income during the decade ending 1901-2 averaged Rs. 19,000, and the expenditure Rs. 18,000. In 1903-4 the income was Rs. 22,000, of which Rs. 10,000 was derived from a tax on houses and lands, and Rs. 5,000 from a conservancy rate; the expenditure was Rs. 21,000. The town possesses the usual public offices, including criminal, revenue, and civil courts, the District jail, a church, a dispensary with 16 beds, a public library, and a high school. The jail has accommodation for 370 prisoners; the industries carried on are brick-making, surki and khoa pounding, cane and bamboo work, and the manufacture of coir mats and jute string. There are three printing presses, and a weekly newspaper and two monthly magazines with a large circulation are published. Part of the town is provided with a filtered water-supply, and it is proposed to extend this by the construction of large water-works.\n\n**Jetpur (Devli).**\u2014State in the Kathiawar Political Agency, Bombay, lying between 22\u00b0 36' and 22\u00b0 49' N. and 70\u00b0 35' and 70\u00b0 51' E., with an area of 94 square miles. The population in 1901 was 11,568, residing in 21 villages. The revenue in 1903-4 was Rs. 1,25,000, and the cultivated area 48 square miles. The State ranks as a fourth-class State in Kathiawar, but the present chief has the rank of a third-class chief. Jetpur is now held by twenty talukdars, descended from a\ncommon ancestor, N\u0101ja Desa; and the four most important States are shown below. N\u0101ja Desa\u2019s two sons, Viro and Jeto, founded the Vir\u0101ni and Jeth\u0101ni subdivisions of Jetpur; and Viro had two sons who in their turn subdivided the Vir\u0101ni estate into two parts, Oghad Vir\u0101ni and K\u0101nthad Vir\u0101ni. The Jeth\u0101ni estate was similarly again subdivided into Vikamshi Jeth\u0101ni and Bhoko Jeth\u0101ni. The four principal States now exercising third and fourth-class jurisdiction are:\n\n| State                  | Class   | Subdivision       |\n|------------------------|---------|-------------------|\n| Jetpur (Devli)         | 3rd class | Bhoko Jeth\u0101ni.    |\n| Jetpur (Vadia)        | \u201d       | K\u0101nthad Vir\u0101ni.   |\n| Jetpur (Mulu Surag)    | 4th class | Vikamshi Jeth\u0101ni. |\n| Jetpur (N\u0101ja K\u0101la)     | \u201d       | Oghad Vir\u0101ni.     |\n\nTwo different accounts are given of the acquisition of Jetpur: namely, that of the T\u0101r\u012bkh-i-Sorath, which says that the first Naw\u0101b of Jun\u0101garh, Bah\u0101dur Kh\u0101n I, granted Jetpur to Vala Vira; and a tradition which says that Viro N\u0101ja of Chital aided the Valas of Bagasra in their feud with Vaijo Khasia of Mitiala, and that Vala S\u0101mant of Bagasra was slain in the battle. In consideration of Viro\u2019s aid the Valas of Bagasra gave him Jetpur. These Bagasra Valas acquired their share in Jetpur from the Khadia Baloch, who received it from the local Muhammadan governors of former times. Subsequently Jetpur was conquered from Champr\u0101j, the great-grandson of Jetha N\u0101ja, by Shams Kh\u0101n, a Musalm\u0101n sard\u0101r. The t\u0101luka remained in an unsettled state for a long time, but in course of time Champr\u0101j\u2019s descendant restored it to its former position.\n\n**Jetpur (Vadia).**\u2014State in the K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r Political Agency, Bombay situated in about 21\u00b0 40\u2032 N. and 71\u00b0 53\u2032 E., with an area of 72 square miles. The population in 1901 was 10,330, residing in 17 villages. The revenue in 1903\u20134 was Rs. 1,30,000, and the cultivated area 43 square miles. The State ranks as a third-class State in K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r. For history see Jetpur (Devli).\n\n**Jetpur (Mulu Surag).**\u2014State in the K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r Political Agency, Bombay, lying between 21\u00b0 36\u2032 and 21\u00b0 49\u2032 N. and 70\u00b0 36\u2032 and 70\u00b0 50\u2032 E., with an area of 25 square miles. The population in 1901 was 6,728, residing in 16 villages. The revenue in 1903\u20134 was Rs. 60,000, and the cultivated area 20 square miles. The State ranks as a fourth-class State in K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r. For history see Jetpur (Devli).\n\n**Jetpur (N\u0101ja K\u0101la or Bilkha).**\u2014State in the K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r Political Agency, Bombay, lying between 21\u00b0 and 21\u00b0 23\u2032 N. and 70\u00b0 35\u2032 and 70\u00b0 57\u2032 E., with an area of 72 square miles. The population in 1901 was 10,366, residing in 24 villages. The revenue in 1903\u20134 was\nRs. 1,75,000, and the cultivated area 52 square miles. The State ranks as a fourth-class State in K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r. For history see Jetpur (Devli).\n\n**Jetpur Town.**\u2014Fortified town in the State of the same name, K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r, Bombay, situated in 21\u00b0 45' N. and 70\u00b0 48' E., on the western bank of the Bh\u0101dar river, 40 miles north-east of Porbandar. Population (1901), 15,919. Jetpur is a flourishing town on the Bhavnagar-Gondal-Junagarh-Porbandar Railway, well equipped with public buildings. A fine bridge has been thrown across the Bh\u0101dar river about a mile north of the town.\n\n**Jeur.**\u2014Market town in the District and t\u0101luka of Ahmadnagar, Bombay, situated in 19\u00b0 18' N. and 74\u00b0 48' E., about 13 miles north-east of Ahmadnagar, on the Toka road. Population (1901), 5,005. The town is enclosed by a ruined wall and has a strong gateway with a paved entrance. Close by, perched on a high hill, is a group of three temples, one of them with an inscription dated 1781. Two miles north of Jeur, at the top of a beautiful ravine, down which winds the Nev\u0101sa road, is the Im\u0101mpur travellers\u2019 bungalow. The bungalow is an old mosque and stands in a large grove with excellent shade.\n\n**Jewar.**\u2014Town in the Khurja tahsil of Bulandshahr District, United Provinces, situated in 28\u00b0 7' N. and 77\u00b0 34' E., 20 miles west of Khurja. Population (1901), 7,718. In the eleventh century J\u0101don R\u0101jputs, invited from Bharatpur by the Br\u0101hmans of Jewar, settled in the town and expelled the Meos. The well-known Begam Sumr\u016b held Jewar till her death in 1836, when it lapsed to Government. The town lies among the ravines and broken ground on the edge of the high land above the Jumna, and is well drained. The market was rebuilt in 1881, and is now lined with good brick-built shops. Jewar is administered under Act XX of 1856, with an income of about Rs. 2,000. There is a small manufacture of cotton rugs and carpets, and a weekly market is held. The town contains a prosperous agricultural bank, a middle school with 120 pupils, and a small primary school for girls, besides a branch of the American Methodist Mission.\n\n**Jeypore.**\u2014Pass in the Him\u0101layas. See Jelep La.\n\n**Jeypore Estate.**\u2014Estate occupying the whole of the northern part of Vizagapatam District, Madras. It embraces practically all the Agency or hill tracts therein, and consists of the tahsils of Nowrangapur, Jeypore, Koraput, Malkangiri, Bissamcuttack, and R\u0101yagada, and the major portion of Padwa, Pottangi, and Gunupur. The residence of the R\u0101j\u0101 is at Jeypore town.\n\nThe zamind\u0101ri is divided into two portions, east and west, by the K\u0101l\u0101handi State of Bengal. The western portion forms the Government subdivision, of which the head-quarters are at Koraput, while\nthe eastern is under the jurisdiction of the Special Assistant-Agent at P\u0101rvatipuram. Each portion has a separate river system, the western being drained by tributaries of the God\u0101vari, and the eastern by the N\u0101g\u0101vali (or L\u0101ngulya) and Vamsadh\u0101ra rivers and their affluents.\n\nVarious forms of under-tenure prevail within the estate. The proprietor of the subsidiary estate of Bissamcuttack holds his land on feudatory tenure; whole villages are leased out for a nominal rent to must\u0101jirs or muttahd\u0101rs, who have in many cases the right to sell portions or the whole of their village without the sanction of the R\u0101j\u0101; while a large portion of the estate is leased out on jer\u0101yati tenure direct to the cultivators.\n\nEthnologically we find that the aboriginal tribes have been overlaid by immigration. The Khonds and Sayaras, who inhabit the wild tracts adjoining the Ganj\u0101m M\u0101liahs (hills), retain their separate tribal characteristics and languages, but in other parts the customs and practices of the new-comers have, in many cases, been adopted. In Kotapad and Singapur, for instance, the earlier peoples have adopted the practice of burning their dead. On the other hand, the Meriah human sacrifice (see M\u0101liahs), which is supposed to be a purely Khond rite, spread among the immigrants and obtained so firm a hold that it had to be suppressed by force, a special agency being employed for that purpose until as late as 1861.\n\nThe ancestors of the present house of Jeypore were at one time retainers of the Gajapati kings of Orissa. In the fifteenth century its founder, Vin\u0101yaka Deo, whom tradition asserts to be descended from the Lunar race of R\u0101jputs, married a daughter of the Gajapati king, who bestowed upon him the Jeypore principality. About the year 1652, when the founder of the Vizianagram family came to Chicacole in the train of the Golconda Faujd\u0101r, Sher Muhammad Kh\u0101n, the present Jeypore family, descended from Vin\u0101yaka Deo, was in possession not only of the country comprised within the present limits of the estate, but of all the hill zamind\u0101ris at the base of the Gh\u0101ts. Jeypore subsequently became tributary to Vizianagram; but in 1794 the Madras Government granted the Jeypore ruler a separate sanad as a reward for his loyalty during their conflict with Vizianagram which ended with the battle of Padman\u0101bham.\n\nIn 1803 the peshkash of the estate was fixed at Rs. 16,000. In addition, Rs. 13,666 is paid for the pargana of Kotapad, in lieu of the tax originally paid thereon to the State of Bastar in the Central Provinces.\n\nIn 1848, owing to the insubordination of members of the R\u0101j\u0101's family, some of the tahs\u012bls of the estate were attached by Government. In 1855 troubles again broke out, and finally, in 1860, the Government was compelled to introduce a system of civil and criminal\nadministration. A Special Assistant-Agent was appointed, and subordinate magistrates and a strong police force were posted in the zamind\u0101ri. Since then the estate has been free from disturbances, save for two unimportant outbreaks among the Savaras in 1865-6.\n\nThe present R\u0101j\u0101 is Sri Vikrama Deo, on whom the title of Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101 was conferred as a special distinction in January, 1896. Under the existing system of administration continual progress is assured; and the recently constituted Forest department is opening out the immense timber resources of the estate, which includes the finest forest in Vizagapatam District.\n\n**Jeypore Tahsil.**\u2014Agency tahsil in Vizagapatam District, Madras, lying above the Gh\u0101ts, with an area of 1,016 square miles. The population in 1901 was 133,831, compared with 140,580 in 1891. They live in 1,213 villages. The chief town is Jeypore (population, 6,689), the residence of the R\u0101j\u0101 of the Jeypore Estate, and a centre of trade between the Central Provinces and the low country of the District. The demand for land revenue and cesses for the whole estate in 1903-4 was Rs. 26,000. The tahsil is all zamind\u0101ri land and is for the most part open and well cultivated, the Kolab river passing through the centre of it.\n\n**Jeysulmere.**\u2014State and town in R\u0101jput\u0101na. See Jaisalmer.\n\n**Jh\u0101bua.**\u2014A guaranteed chiefship under the Bhop\u0101war Agency, Central India, lying between 22\u00b0 28' and 23\u00b0 14' N. and 74\u00b0 20' and 75\u00b0 19' E., with an area of 1,336 square miles. It is bounded on the north by Kush\u0101lgarh State in the R\u0101jput\u0101na Agency; on the south by Jobat State; on the east by Al\u012b-R\u0101jpur and Dh\u0101r; and on the west by the P\u0101nch Mah\u0101ls District of Bombay. The State lies wholly in the mountainous region of M\u0101lw\u0101 known as R\u0101th, which is formed by the branch of the Vindhya that strikes northwards towards Udaipur and constitutes the western boundary of the M\u0101lw\u0101 plateau. A succession of forest-clad ridges run generally north and south, traversed by numerous streams which flow into the An\u0101s, a tributary of the Mahi. The climate throughout most of the State is subject to greater extremes than are met with on the more open land of the M\u0101lw\u0101 plateau. The annual rainfall averages about 30 inches.\n\nThe State takes its name from the chief town, founded in the sixteenth century by a notorious freebooter, Jhabbu Naik, of the Labh\u0101n\u0101 caste. The present ruler is a R\u0101thor R\u0101jput, descended from B\u012br Singh, fifth son of Jodha, the founder of Jodhpur in R\u0101jput\u0101na. This branch of the family rose to favour at Delhi, and acquired Badn\u0101war in M\u0101lw\u0101 in fief in 1584. Kesho D\u0101s, son of Bhim\u0101n Singh, who then held Badn\u0101war, was attached to the retinue of prince Salim, who, on his accession as the emperor Jah\u0101ng\u012br, employed him to subdue the turbulent freebooters infesting the south-\nwestern districts of M\u0101lw\u0101. After suppressing these gangs, Kesho D\u0101s obtained possession of their lands. In 1607 he was invested with the insignia of nobility by the emperor, but died the same year, poisoned by his son and heir. From this time onwards the State was subjected to much internal disturbance, the confusion being greatly increased by the appearance of the Mar\u0101th\u0101s in 1722; and the next year the State was formally placed under the management of Holkar during the minority of the chief. In 1817 the revenues were merely nominal, owing principally to Mar\u0101th\u0101 oppression, though, singularly enough, Holkar left the collection and payment of the chauth or fourth part of the revenue which was his due to the Jh\u0101bua officials. During the settlement of M\u0101lw\u0101 by Sir John Malcolm the State was guaranteed to the family. R\u0101j\u0101 Gop\u0101l Singh (1840-94), though only seventeen years of age at the time of the Mutiny, rendered good service in assisting the fugitives from Bhop\u0101war, in recognition of which he was presented with a khilat of Rs. 12,500 in value. In 1865, however, he permitted a prisoner confined under suspicion of theft to be mutilated, for which a fine of Rs. 10,000 was imposed and his salute discontinued for one year. Till 1870 the States of Indore and Jh\u0101bua exercised joint jurisdiction over the Th\u0101ndla and Petl\u0101wad districts; but as this arrangement led to constant disputes, an exchange of territory was effected in 1871, by which Petl\u0101wad was assigned to Indore, Th\u0101ndla remaining with Jh\u0101bua, which pays Rs. 4,350 a year to Indore in adjustment of revenue. The present chief, Udai Singh, succeeded by adoption in 1894, and has exercised administrative powers since 1898. The ruler bears the title of His Highness and R\u0101j\u0101, and receives a salute of 11 guns.\n\nPopulation has varied at the last three enumerations: (1881) 92,938, (1891) 119,787, and (1901) 80,889. The large decrease during the last decade is accounted for by the severe losses incurred by the Bhil population in the famine of 1899-1900. The density is 60 persons per square mile. Animists, chiefly Bhils, number 58,428, or 72 per cent. of the total population, and Hindus 18,156, or 22 per cent. The Roman Catholic mission has a station at Th\u0101ndla, and native Christians numbered 73 in 1901. The chief tribes and castes are Bhils, 29,200, who form 36 per cent. of the population; Bhil\u0101las, 14,500, or 18 per cent.; Patlias, 8,700, or 10 per cent.; and R\u0101jputs, 2,000, or 3 per cent. Agriculture supports 61 per cent. and general labour 8 per cent. The State contains 686 villages and 158 bhilp\u0101ras (hamlets).\n\nLand is divided locally into two sections: the Mahidh\u0101wa or land along the Mah\u012b river, which is cultivable; and the Gh\u0101ta or hilly tract, of which the greater part of the State is composed, and which is of low fertility and incapable of irrigation. Of the total area, only 120 square miles, or 9 per cent., are under cultivation, and 4 square miles, or\n3 per cent., are irrigated. Of the uncultivated area, 363 square miles, or 27 per cent. of the total area, are cultivable, and 440 square miles, or 33 per cent., are under forest, the remainder being uncultivable waste. Maize occupies 64 square miles, or 53 per cent. of the cultivated area; rice, 12 square miles; gram and wheat, 10 square miles each; jowar, 8 square miles; cotton, 34 square miles; and poppy, 2 square miles.\n\nThe mineral resources are probably considerable, but have not as yet been fully investigated. At present manganese is worked to a small extent in the Rambh\u0101pur pargana by a Bombay firm, who pay a royalty of 4 annas per ton of ore exported. The ore is exported from Meghnagar station on the Ratl\u0101m-Godhra section of the Bombay, Baroda, and Central India Railway, to which a light tramway has been laid by the contractors.\n\nThe isolated and wild nature of the country makes any general development of commerce difficult. The main source of commercial profit is opium, which is exported to Ratl\u0101m.\n\nThe chief means of communication are through the Meghnagar, Bajranggarh, Amargarh, and Bhairongarh stations of the Ratl\u0101m-Godhra section of the Bombay, Baroda, and Central India Railway. In 1900 a metalled road was commenced by the British Government between Jh\u0101bua and the Meghnagar station. British post offices are maintained at Jh\u0101bua, Th\u0101ndla, Bajranggarh, R\u0101n\u0101pur, and Meghnagar.\n\nThe State is divided for administrative purposes into four parganas\u2014Jh\u0101bua, Rambh\u0101pur, R\u0101n\u0101pur, and Th\u0101ndla\u2014each under a tahsildar. Besides these parganas, managed directly by the State, eighteen families of nobles, the Umraos, hold fiefs extending over 946 square miles, or 71 per cent. of the total area, and pay a tribute of Rs. 5,000 to the Darb\u0101r, and Rs. 7,510 to Holkar.\n\nThe administration is carried on by the chief, assisted by the Diw\u0101n and the usual departments, of which the medical and forest are superintended by the Agency Surgeon and the Forest officer, respectively. The chief exercises judicial powers intermediate between those of a District Magistrate and a Sessions Court, all serious cases being reported to the Political Agent. In cases of murder among the Bhils, the D\u0101rbar reports to the Political officer whether the case is one which can be dealt with by the local panch\u0101yat (council of elders) or should be tried by the Political Agent. Appeals in criminal cases lie to the Diw\u0101n and to the chief, with power of reference to the Political Agent. In civil matters the chief's decision is final.\n\nThe normal revenue of the State is 1\u00b71 lakhs, excluding alienated lands (1\u00b73 lakhs). Of this, Rs. 53,000 is derived from land, Rs. 13,000 from customs, Rs. 10,000 from excise, and Rs. 5,000 from tribute.\nThe chief heads of expenditure are Rs. 60,000 on general administration, Rs. 20,000 on the chief's establishment, Rs. 15,000 on collecting the land revenue, and Rs. 3,000 on medical.\n\nThe incidence of the land revenue demand is Rs. 1-4-0 per acre of cultivated land and 3 annas per acre on the total area. As in all R\u0101jput States, much of the land has been alienated in j\u0101g\u012br grants to members of the chief's family and others. These alienated territories comprise 56 per cent. of the total cultivated area, but pay only 3 per cent. of the total revenue. All rents are taken in cash, and since 1902 have been paid direct to the tahs\u012bld\u0101r. Ordinary rates vary from Rs. 3-3-2 to Rs. 9 per acre. A higher rate, amounting sometimes to Rs. 24 an acre, is paid for irrigable land growing poppy and sugar-cane. In the hilly tract, the rates vary from a few annas to Rs. 1.\n\nOpium is weighed at Jh\u0101bua, Th\u0101ndla, and Hanum\u0101ngarh before passing out of the State, and a duty of Rs. 5 is levied per chest of 40 lb.; when the poppy comes from the land of an Umrao Rs. 2 to Rs. 3 are taken by the State, the balance being received by the Umrao.\n\nCopper coins were struck in Jh\u0101bua up to 1881, but discontinued after that date. The British rupee was made legal tender in 1893.\n\nNo regular troops are kept up, such irregulars as exist being used to assist the police. Two serviceable guns are used for firing salutes. The police were organized in 1901, and number 95 men under a chief inspector, besides 425 rural village police. The Central jail is at Jh\u0101bua town.\n\nThe first school was opened in 1854. There are now 17 public and private schools, of which one is the mission school at Th\u0101ndla, established in 1900. There are 283 pupils. In 1901 only 2 per cent. of the population (almost all males) were able to read and write. The State maintains three dispensaries\u2014at Jh\u0101bua, R\u0101n\u0101pur, and Th\u0101ndla.\n\nThe town of Jh\u0101bua is situated in 22\u00b0 45' N. and 74\u00b0 38' E., on the edge of a small lake called the Bah\u0101dur-S\u0101gar, 1,171 feet above sea-level. Population (1901), 3,354. The palace, which is surrounded by a mud wall with masonry bastions, stands on the north bank of the lake. The streets are narrow, steep, and winding. Beside the lake is the cenotaph of R\u0101j\u0101 Ratan Singh (1832-40), who was killed by lightning when riding on an elephant in the Nilkanth procession, during the Dasehra festival. The town is 11 miles from the Meghnagar station on the Godhra-Ratl\u0101m section of the Bombay, Baroda, and Central India Railway. It contains a State guesthouse, a dispensary, a British post office, a jail, and a school.\n\nJhajjar Tahsil.\u2014Tahsil of Rohtak District, Punjab, lying between 28\u00b0 21' and 28\u00b0 41' N. and 76\u00b0 20' and 76\u00b0 56' E., with an area of 466 square miles. The population in 1901 was 123,227, compared with 119,453 in 1891. It contains one town, JHAJJAR (population, 12,227),\nthe head-quarters; and 189 villages, including Georgegarh, founded by George Thomas. The land revenue and cesses in 1903\u20134 amounted to 2.9 lakhs. The tahsil is intersected in all directions by sand ridges which often rise to a considerable height. On the east the low-lying land used to be regularly flooded by the S\u0101hibi and Indori streams, and large swamps then formed in the depressions; but of recent years the volume of these torrents has diminished, and the country rarely remains flooded for any considerable period. The north of the tahsil is a continuation of the plateau of Rohtak and S\u0101mpla, while in the south a few low rocky eminences lend variety to the landscape.\n\nJhajjar Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the tahsil of the same name in Rohtak District, Punjab, situated in 28\u00b0 36' N. and 76\u00b0 40' E., 21 miles south of Rohtak town and 35 miles west of Delhi. Population (1901), 12,227. The town was destroyed by Muhammad of Ghor and refounded by a J\u0101t clan. It was taken from the Naw\u0101bs of Farrukhnagar by the J\u0101t chieftain S\u016braj Mal, and afterwards fell into the hands of Walter Reinhardt, husband of Begam Sumr\u016b. Jhajjar was assigned to George Thomas in 1794, and on annexation in 1803 was granted to Naw\u0101b Nij\u0101bat Kh\u0101n. The estate was confiscated in 1857 owing to the disloyalty of the ruling chief, Abdur Rahm\u0101n Kh\u0101n, who was hanged for his share in the Mutiny. Jhajjar became for a short time the headquarters of a District of that name, which was abolished in 1860. The principal buildings are the old palace of the Naw\u0101bs and the new palace or B\u0101gh Jah\u0101n\u0101ra. The municipality was created in 1867. The income and expenditure during the ten years ending 1902\u20133 averaged Rs. 13,500 and Rs. 14,000 respectively. In 1903\u20134 the income amounted to Rs. 18,600, chiefly derived from octroi, and the expenditure to Rs. 13,800. The town is noted for its dyeing industry, and for the thin or \u2018paper\u2019 pottery produced. It has a considerable manufacture of muslins and woollen goods, and embroidery is also largely carried on. The municipality maintains a dispensary and an Anglo-veracular middle school.\n\nJh\u0101lak\u0101ti.\u2014Town in the head-quarters subdivision of Backergunge District, Eastern Bengal and Assam, situated in 22\u00b0 39' N. and 90\u00b0 13' E., at the junction of the Nalchiti river and the Jh\u0101lak\u0101ti Kh\u0101l. Population (1901), 5,234. Jh\u0101lak\u0101ti lies on the main steamer route between Baris\u0101l and Calcutta, and is one of the most important markets in Eastern Bengal, the chief exports being rice and betel-nuts, and the imports salt, tobacco, oil, and sugar. A very large quantity of timber, especially sundri wood (Heritiera littoralis), cut in the Sundarbans, is sold here. There is an oil-mill with an annual out-turn estimated at Rs. 25,000. Jh\u0101lak\u0101ti was constituted a municipality in 1875. The income during the decade ending 1901\u20132 averaged Rs. 5,200, and the expenditure Rs. 5,000. In 1903\u20134 the income was Rs. 8,800,\nmainly derived from a property tax and a conservancy rate; and the expenditure was Rs. 8,600.\n\n**Jhalaw\u0101n.**\u2014A highland division of the Kal\u0101t State, Baluchist\u0101n, comprising the country to the south of Kal\u0101t as distinguished from Saraw\u0101n, the country to the north of that place, and lying between $25^\\circ 28'$ and $29^\\circ 21'$ N. and $65^\\circ 11'$ and $67^\\circ 27'$ E., with an area of 21,128 square miles. It is bounded on the north by the Saraw\u0101n country; on the south by the Las Bela State; on the east by Kachhi and Sind; and on the west by Kh\u0101r\u0101n and Makr\u0101n. The boundary between the Jhalaw\u0101n country and Sind was settled in 1853\u20134 and demarcated in 1861\u20132. Elsewhere it is still undetermined. An imaginary line drawn east and west through B\u0101ghw\u0101na divides the country into two natural divisions. To the north the general conditions are those of the upper highlands, and to the south those of the lower highlands of Baluchist\u0101n. The country has a gradual slope to the south, with valleys of considerable width lying among lofty mountain ranges.\n\nAmong the more important valleys are S\u016br\u0101b with Gidar, B\u0101ghw\u0101na, Zahri, Khuzd\u0101r with F\u012broz\u0101b\u0101d, Wad, N\u0101l, S\u0101r\u016bna, Jau, and the valley of the Mashkai river. The mountains comprise the southern portion of the Central Br\u0101hui range, including the Harboi hills and the greater part of the K\u012brthar and Pab ranges. On the west the Garr hills and their continuation southward separate the country from Kh\u0101r\u0101n and Makr\u0101n; in the centre lie a number of more or less detached mountains, the chief of which are Dob\u0101nzil (7,347 feet), Hushtir (7,260 feet), Sh\u0101sh\u0101n (7,513 feet), and Dr\u0101 Khel (8,102 feet). The rivers include the Hingol, the largest river in Baluchist\u0101n, with its tributaries the Mashkai and the Arra; the M\u016bla, the Hab, and a portion of the Por\u0101li. Among the less important streams may be mentioned the Karkh or Karu and the Sain, which debouch into the Kachhi plain near Jhal, and the Kol\u0101chi or G\u0101j, which traverses the centre of the country. None of these rivers possesses a continuous flow of water throughout its course.\n\nIn the north of the country nummulitic limestone is met with. Farther south red and white compact limestone (upper Cretaceous) is very extensively distributed. Beds containing chert are of frequent occurrence. Igneous rocks occur near N\u0101l, and on the east are the K\u012brthar, N\u0101ri, and G\u0101j geological groups.\n\nVegetation is scanty except in the Harboi hills, on the north, where juniper and wild almond grow in abundance. Elsewhere olive and pistachio occur. In the south the little tree growth includes *Capparis aphylla*, *Prosopis spicigera*, two kinds of *Acacia*, and *Tamarix articulata*. The northern hill-sides are thickly covered with a scrub jungle of *Artemisia* and *Haloxylon Griffithii*. Tulips, irises, and other bulbous plants\nappear in the spring. The grasses are of the orders *Bromus*, *Poa*, and *Hordeum*. Dwarf-palm (*Nannorhops Ritchieana*) grows in profusion in the lower hills. Pomegranates are the commonest trees in the gardens, but apricots, mulberries, and dates are also found.\n\nSind ibex and mountain sheep are the most common game, but their numbers are decreasing. Leopards and black bears are occasionally killed. Wild hog are met with in the Mashkai valley. \u2018Ravine deer\u2019 are common. A few grey and black partridge are to be found in Lower Jhalaw\u0101n; *chikor* are numerous in the higher parts, and *s\u012bs\u012b* almost everywhere.\n\nUpper Jhalaw\u0101n possesses a climate resembling that of Quetta, moderate in summer and cold in winter, with well-marked seasons. The lower parts are pleasant in winter, but subject to intense heat in summer. At this time fever is very prevalent in places south of the Harboi range. Earthquakes frequently occur in the neighbourhood of Wad and Mashkai. The rainfall is scanty, and is received in the upper highlands in winter and in the lower parts in spring or summer.\n\nThe country passed in the seventh century from the Rai dynasty of Sind to the Arabs, by whom it was known as Tur\u0101n. Its capital was Khuzd\u0101r, which place was also the head-quarters of the Arab general commanding the Indian frontier. Kaik\u0101n\u0101n, probably the modern N\u0101l, was another place of importance. The Ghaznivids and Ghorids next held the country, and were followed by the Mongols, the advent of Chingiz Kh\u0101n being still commemorated by the Chingiz Kh\u0101n rock between Nich\u0101ra and Pandr\u0101n. With the rise of the S\u016bmra and Samma dynasties in Sind, the Jat aborigines of the country appear to have gained the ascendancy, but in the middle of the fifteenth century they were ousted by the Mirw\u0101ris. Beginning from Nigh\u0101r near S\u016br\u0101b, these founders of the Br\u0101hui kingdom gradually extended their dominion over all the Jhalaw\u0101n hills. For many years the country remained firmly attached to the Kh\u0101ns of Kal\u0101t; but the struggles which took place during M\u012br Khud\u0101d\u0101d Kh\u0101n\u2019s reign involved the Jhalaw\u0101n tribesmen also and resulted in the strangling of their leader, T\u0101j Muhammad, Zarakzai. In 1869 J\u0101m M\u012br Kh\u0101n of Las Bela, who had caused the people of Jhalaw\u0101n to rebel under N\u016br-ud-d\u012bn Mengal, received a severe defeat in a battle near Khuzd\u0101r, when he lost seven guns. Owing to its remoteness from Quetta, the Jhalaw\u0101n country did not come so quickly and completely under control after the British occupation as the Saraw\u0101n country; and an outbreak which began in 1893 under the leadership of Gauhar Kh\u0101n, the Zahri chief, simmered till 1895, when it was put down by the Kal\u0101t State troops at the fight of Garm\u0101p, in which both Gauhar Kh\u0101n and his son lost their lives.\n\nThe country is comparatively rich in archaeological remains. They include many *gabrbands* or embankments of the fire-worshippers; a\ncurious vaulted burial chamber cut in the slope of the hill near Pand-r\u0101n; and several tombs which indicate a system of superterrene burial. Interesting earthen vessels, and stones bearing Kufic inscriptions, have been excavated from the numerous mounds in the country.\n\nJhalaw\u0101n contains no large towns and only 299 permanent villages. Khuzd\u0101r is the head-quarters station. Most of the people live in blanket tents or mat huts. The inhabitants, the majority of whom are Br\u0101huis with here and there a few Baloch, Jats, and Loris, number (1901) 224,073, or about 11 persons to the square mile. They include the direct subjects of the Kh\u0101n, such as K\u016brds, Nigh\u0101ris, Gazgis, and Nak\u012bbs, who cultivate lands in the Kh\u0101n's ni\u0101bats; and tribal units. The principal tribes are the Zahri (49,000), the Mengal (69,000), the Muhammad Hasni (53,000), and the Bizanjau (14,000). Among minor tribal groups may be mentioned the S\u0101jdi, Rodeni, Rekizai, Gurgn\u0101ri, Sumal\u0101ri, Kambr\u0101ni, Mirw\u0101ri, and Kalanda-r\u0101ni. The leading chief of the Jhalaw\u0101n tribes belongs to the Zarakzai clan of the Zahri tribe. A few Hindus carry on the trade of the country. Most of the people speak Br\u0101hui; a few speak Sind\u012b; the remainder, especially on the southwest, Baluch\u012b. The majority of the people are Sunni Muhammadans, but some are Zikris, especially the S\u0101jdis. Agriculture and flock-owning are the only occupations. Every year in September a large migration of nomads takes place to Kachhi and Sind, where they engage in harvesting and return to the highlands in spring.\n\nCultivation is confined to the valleys and the flats beside the river courses. Most of the cultivated tracts consist of 'dry-crop' areas, dependent on flood-water which is held up by embankments. In comparison with the Saraw\u0101n country, irrigation is scarce. It is obtained from springs, from k\u0101rez, which number only thirty-five, and from channels cut from the rivers. Most of the springs and k\u0101rez occur in Upper Jhalaw\u0101n. Tracts irrigated by river water include Zahri, part of Gidar, Khuzd\u0101r and Zidi, Karkh and Chakku, the valleys of the M\u016bla and Kol\u0101chi rivers, and Mashkai. Well-irrigation is unknown. The soil has a considerable mixture of sand, and is but moderately fertile. 'Dry-crop' areas produce better crops than 'wet' areas, unless the latter are highly manured.\n\nThe spring harvest is the most important, consisting chiefly of wheat. On the south-west, however, wheat suffers from the damp caused by the sea-breezes, and its place is taken by barley. Rice is grown along the banks of the M\u016bla and Kol\u0101chi rivers, and, with jow\u0101r, forms the chief autumn harvest. Dates are grown in Mashkai. Cultivation is gradually extending, but the people prefer flock-owning to cultivation, and progress is slow. Jhalaw\u0101n is in fact a vast grazing tract.\n\nThe bullocks are hardy but small, and a good many are bred in the\nlower tracts. Sheep and goats are found in vast numbers. The Khor\u0101s\u0101ni variety of sheep is preferred to the indigenous kind, owing to its larger tail. Most of the camels are transport animals, and camel-breeding is almost entirely confined to the Pab range. A few horses are kept in the north, but they are not so numerous as in the Saraw\u0101n country.\n\nLead-smelting was carried on in former days at Sekr\u0101n near Khuzd\u0101r, and Masson mentions the employment of 200 men in 1840, but the industry has now been abandoned. Little is known of the other minerals of the country. Ferrous sulphate (melanterite), known locally as z\u0101gh or kh\u0101ghal, has been found in the Ledav river and near Zahri. A soft ferruginous lithomarge, known as m\u0101k, is used as a mordant in dyeing.\n\nThe manufacture of coarse woollen rugs in the dar\u012b stitch, and of felts, ropes, and bags, is general; good pile carpets are woven for private use by the B\u0101dinzai Kalandar\u0101nis of T\u016btak and at a few other places. Nich\u0101ra needlework is famous locally. There is a large export to Sind of matting and materials for mat-making, and many of the people entirely depend on this source of livelihood. The chief centres of trade are S\u016brab, Khuzd\u0101r, N\u0101l, Wad, and Mashkai; but trading is much hindered by the levy of transit dues by both the Kal\u0101t State and local chiefs. Ghi, wool, live sheep, and materials for mats are the principal exports; coarse cloth, sugar, mustard oil, and jow\u0101r are imported.\n\nRailways and metalled roads do not exist. Travellers follow camel-tracks, the most important of which are the Kal\u0101t-Bela route, known as the Kohan-w\u0101t, via Khuzd\u0101r, Wad, and the B\u0101r\u0101n Lak; the Kal\u0101t-Panjg\u016br route via S\u016br\u0101b; and the Kachhi-Makr\u0101n route via the M\u016bla Pass, Khuzd\u0101r, N\u0101l, and Mashkai. An unmetalled road is now under construction between Kal\u0101t and Wad.\n\nDrought is frequent, owing to the shortness of the rainfall, but the proximity of Sind enables the inhabitants to find a ready means of support at such times. During a drought of exceptional severity, which began in 1897 and culminated in 1901, Br\u0101huis were known in several instances to have taken their daughters of marriageable age to Sind, where the high bride-prices obtained for them enabled the parents to tide over the bad times. Cases have also been known in which servile dependants were exchanged for a maund of dates.\n\nSince 1903 an officer, known as the Native Assistant for the Jhalaw\u0101n country, has been posted to Khuzd\u0101r by the Kh\u0101n of Kal\u0101t under the supervision of the Political Agent. He is supported by twenty levies, and decides petty intertribal and other cases with the assistance of jirgas. For administrative purposes,\nthe country consists of areas subject to the Kh\u0101n of Kal\u0101t and of tribal areas. The former include the ni\u0101bats of S\u016br\u0101b and Khuzd\u0101r, each of which is in charge of a naib. In S\u016br\u0101b there is a j\u0101-nash\u012bn, or assistant, stationed at Mashkai; and in Khuzd\u0101r three j\u0101-nash\u012bns, stationed at Karkh or Karu, Zidi, and B\u0101ghw\u0101na. The Kh\u0101n\u2019s interests in Zahri are supervised by a daroga. His rights at Gazg are leased to a farmer with those of Joh\u0101n in the Saraw\u0101n country. In former times the Kh\u0101n\u2019s naibs exercised a general control and communicated the Kh\u0101n\u2019s orders to the tribal chiefs; but the latter are now largely controlled by the Political Agent through the Native Assistant in the Jhalaw\u0101n country. They decide cases occurring among their tribesmen according to tribal custom. In civil suits, a custom has been established of taking one-fourth of the value of the property decreed.\n\nLand revenue, in the case of the subjects of the Kh\u0101n, is always taken in produce, the rates generally varying from one-fourth to one-eighth. Cesses, known as ras\u016bm or law\u0101zim\u0101t, are also levied, by which the State share is largely increased. Transit dues, and fines known as b\u0101di haw\u0101i, constitute the other sources of revenue in the ni\u0101bats. Contrary to the custom in the Saraw\u0101n country, the Jhalaw\u0101n chiefs exact m\u0101lia from their tribesmen, generally in the shape of one sheep per household annually. Sheep are also taken on marriages and other festivals in a chief\u2019s household, and on the occurrence of deaths. These payments are known as bij\u0101r and purs. Some of the chiefs also levy octroi and transit dues. The value of the total revenue from the Kh\u0101n\u2019s ni\u0101bats varies with the agricultural conditions of the year. In 1903\u20134 the approximate amounts received were as follows: S\u016br\u0101b with Mashkai, Rs. 15,500; Khuzd\u0101r, Rs. 14,200; Zahri, Rs. 1,300; total, Rs. 31,000.\n\nIn 1894, owing to the unsatisfactory state of affairs in Jhalaw\u0101n, the Kh\u0101n sanctioned payments aggregating about Rs. 40,000 per annum to the chiefs of the principal tribes, in return for which they were made responsible for the peace of their respective areas. This sum included the allowances of the Rind and Magassi chiefs in Kachhi. A sum of Rs. 3,600 is also contributed by the British Government. At this time tribal levy posts of ten men each were also instituted at Zahri and S\u0101r\u016bna. A post of ten men has since been stationed at S\u016br\u0101b, besides the Native Assistant\u2019s levies at Khuzd\u0101r. The naib of Khuzd\u0101r is assisted by forty-five levies for revenue and police purposes, and the naib of S\u016br\u0101b by twenty-five men; but these numbers are increased or reduced as occasion requires. The naibs and stronger chiefs generally have stocks in their forts or houses in which offenders are placed.\n\nA few of the chiefs employ Afgh\u0101n mull\u0101s for teaching their sons;\notherwise education is unknown. The people are very superstitious, and have a firm belief in the influence of evil spirits, to whom diseases are generally attributed. A few resort to the dispensary at Kal\u0101t for medical treatment. They are well versed in the use, as remedies, of the medicinal drugs which the country produces in large quantities. The sick are frequently branded; for fevers the usual remedy is to wrap the patient in the fresh skin of a sheep or goat. Inoculation by Saiyids is general, except in the case of the Zikris.\n\n**Jh\u0101law\u0101r.**\u2014Pr\u0101nt or division of K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r, Bombay. It takes its name from the Jh\u0101la R\u0101jputs, who own the principal estates, and includes the States of Dhr\u0101ngadhra, the chief of which is the recognized head of the Jh\u0101la clan, Limdi, Wadhw\u0101n, and other minor States. The area is about 3,978 square miles. The population in 1901 was 305,138, the density being 76 persons per square mile. The revenue in 1903\u20134 amounted to Rs. 23,59,580.\n\n**Jh\u0101law\u0101r State.**\u2014State in the south-east of R\u0101jput\u0101na, with an area of about 810 square miles. It consists of two separate tracts. The smaller, barely 14 square miles in extent, is known as Kirp\u0101pur, and is quite unimportant. The main tract lies between 23\u00b0 45\u2032 and 24\u00b0 41\u2032 N. and 75\u00b0 28\u2032 and 76\u00b0 15\u2032 E., and is bounded on the north-east and north by Kotah; on the north-west and west by the R\u0101mpura-Bh\u0101npura district (of Indore), and the Agar tahsil (of Gwalior); on the southwest by S\u012bt\u0101mau and Jaora; on the south by Dew\u0101s and Agar; and on the east by Pir\u0101wa (of Tonk) and R\u0101mpura-Bh\u0101npura. In shape it resembles the letter S, with a length of about 85 miles and a breadth varying from 3 to 17 miles. The country rises gradually from 1,000 feet above sea-level in the north to 1,500 feet in the south. A narrow range of low and fairly wooded hills runs south-east past the town of Jh\u0101lap\u0101tan in the north, and the southern half of the State is generally hilly, and intersected by small streams, but the rest of the country is a rich undulating plain. The principal rivers are the Chambal and the K\u0101l\u012b Sind, but neither ever actually enters the State, the former flowing for 9 miles along the south-western, and the latter for about 17 miles along the north-eastern boundary. The Chhot\u012b K\u0101l\u012b Sind enters the State in the south-west, and after flowing for about 20 miles through the centre of the Gangdh\u0101r tahsil, joins the Chambal. The Au or Ahu river rises near the cantonment of Agar and flows north, generally along the borders of Jh\u0101law\u0101r, till it reaches the Mukandw\u0101ra range of hills in the extreme north of the State, when it turns abruptly to the south-east, and about 8 miles lower down joins the K\u0101l\u012b Sind near G\u0101agraun.\n\nThe rocks of Jh\u0101law\u0101r consist generally of shales, limestone, and sandstone belonging to the Upper Vindhyan group.\n\nBesides the usual small game, antelope and \u2018ravine deer\u2019 are found\nin the plains. Tigers are occasionally met with in the forests near the capital, but leopards and wild hog are fairly common. *Sambhar* (*Cervus unicolor*), *chital* (*Cervus axis*), and *nilgai* (*Boselaphus tragocamelus*) frequent certain localities, but only in limited numbers.\n\nThe climate resembles that of M\u0101lw\u0101, and is generally healthy. The hot season is less severe than that of Northern and Western R\u0101jput\u0101na, and though hot winds sometimes blow in April and May, the nights are usually cool and refreshing. The annual rainfall for the State averages 37 inches, of which about 25 are received in July and August, and 10 in June and September. The rainfall has varied from about $13\\frac{1}{2}$ inches at the capital in 1877 to over 68 inches at Gangdh\u0101r (in the south-west) in 1900.\n\nThe ruling family belongs to the Jh\u0101la clan of R\u0101jp\u016bts, which has given its name to the State. One R\u0101jdhar is said to have founded the petty chiefship of Halwad in K\u0101thi\u0101war about 1488; and the eighth in succession to him had a son, Bha\u014d Singh, who left his own country and proceeded first to Idar, and next to Ajmer, where he married the daughter of the Sesodia Th\u0101kur of S\u0101war, by whom he had a son, M\u0101dho Singh, and a daughter. Nothing more is known of Bha\u014d Singh; but M\u0101dho Singh proceeded to Kotah in the time of Mah\u0101rao Bhim Singh, gained the favour of that chief, and obtained the estate of N\u0101nta with the post of Faujd\u0101r or commander of the troops as well as of the fort. About the same time his sister was married to Arjun Singh, the eldest son of the Kotah chief; and this family connexion, while adding to M\u0101dho Singh\u2019s authority, procured for him the respectful title of m\u0101m\u0101, or maternal uncle, from the younger members of the Kotah family. M\u0101dho Singh was succeeded as Faujd\u0101r by his son Madan Singh, and the post became hereditary in the family. Himmat Singh followed Madan Singh, and was in turn succeeded in 1758 by his famous nephew, Z\u0101lim Singh, whom he had adopted, and who was at the time only eighteen years of age. Three years later Z\u0101lim Singh was the means of securing victory for the troops of Kotah over the army of Jaipur at Bhatw\u0101ra; but he afterwards fell into disfavour with his master (Mah\u0101rao Guman Singh) in consequence of some rivalry in love, and, being dismissed from his office, he migrated to Udaipur, where he did good service, and received from the Mah\u0101r\u0101n\u0101 the title of R\u0101j R\u0101n\u0101. Later on, he retraced his steps to Kotah, where he was not only pardoned but reinstated in his old office; and when the Mah\u0101rao was on his deathbed, he sent for Z\u0101lim Singh and committed his son, Umed Singh, and the country to his charge. From this time (1771) Z\u0101lim Singh was the real ruler of Kotah. He raised it to a state of high prosperity, and under his administration, which lasted for more than fifty years, the Kotah territory was respected by all parties. Through him a treaty was made with the British Government.\nin 1817, by which Kotah was taken under protection; and by a supplementary article, added in 1818, the entire administration was vested in R\u0101j R\u0101n\u0101 Z\u0101lim Singh and his heirs in regular succession and perpetuity. Z\u0101lim Singh, the Machiavelli of R\u0101jasth\u0101n, as Tod calls him, died in 1824, and his son, M\u0101dho Singh, received undisputed charge of the administration. His unfitness for office was a matter of notoriety, and he was in turn succeeded by his son, Madan Singh. In 1834 disputes between the chief of Kotah and his minister were constantly occurring, and there was danger of a popular rising for the expulsion of the latter. It was therefore resolved, with the consent of the Mah\u0101rao of Kotah, to dismember the State and to create the new principality of Jh\u0101law\u0101r as a separate provision for the descendants of Z\u0101lim Singh. Seventeen districts, yielding a revenue of 12 lakhs, were made over to Madan Singh and his heirs and successors, being the descendants of R\u0101j R\u0101n\u0101 Z\u0101lim Singh, according to the custom of succession obtaining in R\u0101jw\u0101ra; and by a treaty dated 1838 this new principality was taken under the protection of the British Government, and agreed to supply troops according to its means, and pay a tribute of Rs. 80,000. The Jh\u0101law\u0101r State thus dates from 1838; and its first chief, Madan Singh, on assuming charge, received the title of Mah\u0101r\u0101j R\u0101n\u0101, was entitled to a salute of 15 guns, and was placed on the same footing as the other chiefs of R\u0101jput\u0101na. He died in 1845 and was succeeded by his son, Prithwi Singh, who, during the Mutiny of 1857\u20138, did good service by conveying to places of safety several Europeans who had taken refuge in his State. He received the usual sanad guaranteeing to him the right of adoption in 1862, and on his death in August, 1875, was succeeded by his adopted son, Bakht Singh, of the Wadhwan family in K\u0101thiaw\u0101r. The latter, in accordance with family custom, which enjoined that only the four names of Z\u0101lim Singh, M\u0101dho Singh, Madan Singh, and Prithwi Singh should be assumed by the rulers of this house, took the name of Z\u0101lim Singh. As he was a minor, the administration was carried on by a Political Superintendent assisted by a Council, and he himself joined the Mayo College at Ajmer. He attained his majority in 1883 and was invested with governing powers (subject to certain restrictions) in 1884; but as he failed to administer his State in accordance with the principles laid down for his guidance, the Government of India was compelled to withdraw his powers in 1887, and to restore the arrangements which were in force during his minority. In 1892 Z\u0101lim Singh promised amendment, and was entrusted with the charge of all the departments except that of land revenue, which was to remain under the Council, while in September, 1894, this reservation was withdrawn and he obtained full powers. But he failed to govern the State properly, and was deposed in 1896; he now lives at Benares, and receives an allowance of Rs. 30,000 a year. Z\u0101lim Singh had no sons;\nand there being no direct descendants of his namesake, the great regent, the Government of India restored to Kotah part of the territories which had been made over in 1838 to form the principality of Jh\u0101law\u0101r, and formed the remaining districts into a new State for the descendants of the family to which the first R\u0101j R\u0101n\u0101 (Z\u0101lim Singh) belonged, and for those Sard\u0101rs and others whose allegiance it was considered undesirable to transfer to Kotah. In 1897 Kunwar Bhaw\u0101ni Singh, son of Th\u0101kur Chhatars\u0101l of Fatehpur, and a descendant of M\u0101dho Singh, the first Jh\u0101la Faujd\u0101r of Kotah, was selected by Government to be the chief of the new State. Arrangements were completed by the end of 1898, and the actual transfer of territory took place on January 1, 1899, from which date the new State of Jh\u0101law\u0101r came into existence. Bhaw\u0101ni Singh was installed as ruler, under the title of R\u0101j R\u0101n\u0101, with a salute of 11 guns, and was at the same time invested with full powers of administration. The tribute payable to the British Government is now Rs. 30,000 a year. His Highness was educated at the Mayo College. The principal events of his rule have been the famine of 1899\u20131900; the adoption of Imperial postal unity in 1900; the introduction of British currency and weights in 1901; and his visit to Europe in 1904.\n\nThe places of archaeological interest are the remains of the old city of Chandr\u0101vati close to Jh\u0101lr\u0101p\u0101t\u0101n Town, and the rock-cut st\u016bpas at the village of Kholvi\u00b9 in the Dag tahs\u012bl in the south. The latter are interesting as being probably the most modern group of Buddhist caves in India.\n\nThe number of towns and villages in the State is 410, and the population at each of the three enumerations was: (1881) 340,488, (1891) 343,601, and (1901) 90,175. The decrease since 1891 was of course due mainly to the remodelling of the State in 1899, but to a considerable extent also to the famine of 1899\u20131900 and the severe epidemic of malarial fever which followed. Although vital statistics in Native States are not very reliable, it may be mentioned that in the entire State in 1900 only 941 births were registered, while deaths numbered 13,872. The State is divided into five tahs\u012bls and possesses two towns, Jh\u0101lr\u0101p\u0101t\u0101n and the chhaoni or cantonment of the same name, both administered as municipalities. The table on the next page gives the chief statistics of population in 1901.\n\nIn 1901 Hindus numbered 78,107, or 86 per cent. of the population, the majority being Vaishnavas; Musalm\u0101ns, 8,845, or nearly 10 per cent., mostly of the Sunni sect; and Jains, 3,129, or 3 per cent. The languages mainly spoken are M\u0101lw\u012b (or R\u0101ngr\u012b) and H\u0101raoti, both dialects of R\u0101jasth\u0101ni.\n\n\u00b9 Archaeological Survey of Northern India, vol. ii, pp. 280\u20138; and J. Fergusson, History of Indian and Eastern Architecture (1889), pp. 132 and 162.\nAmong castes and tribes the most numerous are the Sondhias, who number 22,000, or 24 per cent. of the total population. They claim to be R\u0101jputs, but are probably of mixed descent; they are described as idle, ignorant, immoral, and given to cattle-lifting. Next come the Cham\u0101rs (workers in leather and agriculturists), forming 8 per cent. of the total; Br\u0101hmans, some of whom are cultivators, while others are engaged in religious or menial services, 7 per cent.; Mah\u0101jans (bankers and traders), 6 per cent.; Balais (cultivators, workers in leather, and village chaukid\u0101rs) and G\u016bjars (cattle-breeders and dealers, and agriculturists), each between 4 and 5 per cent. More than 54 per cent. of the people live by the land, and many others combine agriculture with their special occupations.\n\nThe soils may be divided into three classes: namely, k\u0101li, a rich black loam; m\u0101l, a loam of a lighter colour but almost as fertile; and barli, often of a reddish colour, generally stony and sandy, and always shallow. Of these classes, it is estimated that the second supplies about one-half and the others about one-fourth each of the cultivable area.\n\nAgricultural statistics are available only for the kh\u0101lsa portion of the State, the area of which is about 558 square miles. From this must be deducted 158 square miles occupied by forests, rivers, towns, roads, &c., leaving 400 square miles available for cultivation. The average net area cropped during the last four years has been about 125 square miles, or 31 per cent. of the kh\u0101lsa area available for cultivation. The principal crops and the area (in square miles) ordinarily cultivated in each case are: jow\u0101r, 85; maize, 14; cotton, 8; and poppy, gram, and wheat, each about 7.\n\nCattle are plentiful and of a good stamp, being largely of the M\u0101lw\u0101 breed. The State used to be noted for its ponies, but excessive mortality in the recent famine has greatly reduced their numbers. The goats and sheep are of the ordinary type, and are largely kept to provide wool, meat, milk, and manure. Cattle fairs are held yearly at Jh\u0101lap\u0101tan town at the end of April and beginning of November.\nThe area ordinarily irrigated is about 19 square miles. Irrigation is chiefly from wells, of which more than 6,000 are in working order, about 1,350 being masonry. Leather buckets drawn up with a rope and pulley by bullocks are always used for lifting the water, except when the latter is near the surface and the area to be irrigated is small, when a *dhenkli*, or long pole supported by a prop, with a jar or bucket at one end and a weight at the other, is used.\n\nForests cover an area of nearly 8 square miles, and are looked after by a department called D\u016bngar-B\u0101gar. The principal trees are the *dhao* (*Anogeissus pendula*), *dh\u0101k* (*Butea frondosa*), *gurjan* (*Dipterocarpus turbinatus*), and *tend\u016b* (*Diospyros tomentosa*), and such fruit trees as the *bel* (*Aegle Marmelos*), mango, and *mahua* (*Bassia latifolia*). The forest income in 1903\u20134 was about Rs. 4,300, and the expenditure Rs. 1,800.\n\nThe hills near the capital contain large quantities of excellent sandstone, mostly of a greyish colour, but in places almost white or deep red. The stone is much used for building purposes. Iron and copper have been found in places, but these minerals are not now worked.\n\nThe manufactures are unimportant, and consist of rough cotton fabrics, floorcloths, brass utensils, knives, and sword-blades. The chief exports are opium (to Ujjain and Indore), oilseeds, and cotton; while the chief imports are food-grains (mainly from H\u0101raoti), salt, sugar, cloth, and metals.\n\nThere is at present no railway in the State, but the N\u0101gda-Muttra line, now under construction, will pass through three *tahs\u012bls*. The total length of metalled roads is 64 miles, and of unmetalled roads 72 miles. The State adopted Imperial postal unity in 1900, and now contains six British post offices, two of which (at Jh\u0101lr\u0101p\u0101tan and the *chhaoni*) are also telegraph offices.\n\nOwing to its geographical position, the State has generally a very good rainfall, and scarcities and famines are uncommon. Indeed, during the last hundred years the only famine appears to have been that of 1899\u20131900. The rain practically ceased after July, 1899, with the result that the autumn crop failed almost entirely, and there was considerable scarcity of fodder. The Darb\u0101r started numerous works and poorhouses, at which nearly 1\u00bd million units were relieved at a cost exceeding 2 lakhs, and, besides making liberal advances to agriculturists, granted remissions and suspensions of land revenue.\n\nThe State is governed by the R\u0101j R\u0101n\u0101, with the assistance of a Diw\u0101n. In charge of each of the five *tahs\u012bls* is a *tahsild\u0101r*, who is assisted by a *naib-tahsild\u0101r* in the large P\u0101tan *tahs\u012bl*.\n\nIn the administration of justice the courts follow generally the Codes\nin force in British India. The lowest courts are those of the tahsil-d\u0101rs; they decide civil suits not exceeding Rs. 100 in value, and can sentence to one month's imprisonment and fine up to Rs. 30. Over them are the Diw\u0101ni Ad\u0101lat, which tries civil suits not exceeding Rs. 5,000 in value, and the Faujd\u0101ri Ad\u0101lat, which can pass a sentence of two years' imprisonment and fine up to Rs. 300. The next court is the Appellate Court; its powers on the civil side are unlimited, while on the criminal side it can pass any sentence allowed by law, but its proceedings in capital cases require the confirmation of the Mahakma kh\u0101s, which is presided over by the R\u0101j R\u0101n\u0101, and is the final appellate authority in the State.\n\nThe normal revenue is at present about 4 lakhs a year, the chief sources being land (3 lakhs) and customs (Rs. 60,000). The ordinary expenditure is slightly less than the revenue; and the main items are army and police (Rs. 75,000), revenue and judicial staff (Rs. 72,000), palace and privy purse (Rs. 45,000), public works and tribute to Government (Rs. 30,000 each), and stables (about Rs. 20,000). The State is free from debt.\n\nJh\u0101law\u0101r had formerly a silver and copper coinage of its own, known as Madan sh\u0101hi (after its first chief), and up to about 1893 the value of the local rupee was always equal to, and sometimes greater than, that of the British coin. Subsequently it began to decline in exchange value, till, in 1899, 123 Madan sh\u0101hi rupees exchanged for 100 British. The R\u0101j R\u0101n\u0101 thereupon decided to abolish the local coinage, and introduce British in its stead as the sole legal tender in the State; and this was carried out, with the assistance of Government, between March 1 and August 30, 1901.\n\nThe State may be divided into two main areas: namely, that paying revenue to the Darb\u0101r and called kh\u0101lsa, and that granted revenue-free to j\u0101gird\u0101rs and mu\u0101fid\u0101rs. The former occupies about 558 and the latter 252 square miles. The majority of the j\u0101gird\u0101rs pay a small tribute yearly or every second year to the Darb\u0101r, and some have to supply horses and men for the service of the State. Mu\u0101fi lands are those granted for religious or charitable purposes or in lieu of pay, and some of the holders have to pay certain dues (sis\u0101la) every other year. In the kh\u0101lsa area there are two tenures: namely, kh\u0101ted\u0101ri, which is the same as ryotw\u0101ri; and watand\u0101ri, which is somewhat similar to zamind\u0101ri. The former prevails in the P\u0101tan tahsil; each individual holder is responsible directly to the State for the revenue of his holding, and possesses certain rights which are heritable, and which can be mortgaged but not sold. In the rest of the State, the other tenure prevails. The watand\u0101rs are members of the village community, and their interests are hereditary and transferable, and not lost by absence. They are responsible for payment of the State demand, and arrange\namong themselves for the cultivation of the village lands and the distribution of the revenue.\n\nFormerly the land revenue was paid in kind; but in 1805 Z\u0101lim Singh substituted a money-rate per bigha for each class of soil, and his rates remained nominally in force till the present settlement was made in 1884. This settlement was concluded directly with individual holders (kh\u0101ted\u0101rs) in the P\u0101tan tahsil, and with the watand\u0101rs in the rest of the State. The rates per acre vary from about Rs. 5 to over Rs. 23 for \u2018wet\u2019 land, and from about 13 annas to Rs. 6 for \u2018dry\u2019 land, but the p\u0101n or betel-leaf gardens near the capital pay more than Rs. 44 per acre.\n\nThe military force consists of 100 cavalry, 71 gunners, and 420 infantry, and there are 20 field and 25 other guns classed as serviceable. The majority (about 300) of the infantry are employed on police duties in the districts.\n\nThe police force proper numbers 366 officers and men, 30 of the latter being mounted, distributed over seven police stations. There are also 166 village chaukid\u0101rs who hold lands revenue-free for their services.\n\nBesides the Central jail at the chhaoni, there are lock-ups at the headquarters of each tahsil, in which persons sentenced to imprisonment not exceeding one month are confined.\n\nIn regard to the literacy of its population, Jh\u0101law\u0101r stands seventh among the twenty States and chiefships of R\u0101jput\u0101na, with 3\u00b74 per cent. (6\u00b74 males and 0\u00b72 females) able to read and write. There are now nine schools in the State, and the daily average attendance during 1904\u20135 was 424. The only notable institution is the high school (at the chhaoni), in which English, Urd\u016b, Hindi, and Sanskrit are taught. The other schools are all primary, and include one for girls (attended by twelve pupils) and one specially for Sondhias. No fees are charged anywhere, and the yearly expenditure on education is about Rs. 6,000.\n\nIn the beginning of 1904 there were four hospitals and two dispensaries, but one of the latter was closed during the year. The hospitals have accommodation for 34 in-patients. During 1904 the number of cases treated was 38,177 (189 being those of in-patients), and 1,533 operations were performed.\n\nVaccination was commenced about 1870\u20131, but is nowhere compulsory. A staff of two vaccinators is kept up, and in 1904\u20135 the number of persons successfully vaccinated was 2,114, or more than 23 per 1,000 of the population. The total State expenditure on medical institutions and vaccination, including a share of the pay of the Agency Surgeon and his establishment, is about Rs. 17,000.\n\n[R\u0101jput\u0101na Gazetteer, vol. ii (1879, under revision); H.

Jhalid\u0101 was constituted a municipality in 1888. The income and expenditure during the decade ending 1901\u20132 averaged Rs. 3,000. In 1903\u20134 the income was Rs. 3,700, mainly from a tax on persons (or property tax); and the expenditure was Rs. 3,400. Jhalid\u0101 is a centre of the lac and cutlery industries.\n\nJh\u0101lod.\u2014Town in the petty division (petha) of the same name in the Dohad taluka of the P\u0101nch Mah\u0101ls District, Bombay, situated in $23^\\circ 6' N.$ and $74^\\circ 9' E.$ Population (1901), 5,917. The inhabitants are mostly Bhils, Gh\u0101nchis, and Kunbis. There is an export trade in grain, pottery, cotton cloth, and lac bracelets in imitation of the costly ivory Rat\u0101m bracelets. Flagstone is also exported in large quantities. The town contains a dispensary and six schools, four for boys and two for girls, attended by 223 and 88 pupils respectively.\n\nJh\u0101lrap\u0101tan Chhaoni (or cantonment).\u2014Chief town and official capital of the State of Jh\u0101law\u0101r, R\u0101jput\u0101na, situated in $24^\\circ 36' N.$ and $76^\\circ 10' E.$, on a rising stretch of rocky ground over 1,000 feet above the sea, between the fort of G\u0101graun (in Kotah) and the town of Jh\u0101lrap\u0101tan. The chhaoni, as it is always called locally, was founded in 1791 by Z\u0101lim Singh, regent of Kotah, and was at first merely a permanent camp, which he made his head-quarters on account of its central and strategical position. Houses gradually took the place of tents and huts, and in course of time the old camp attained the importance of a town. The population in 1901 numbered 14,315, of whom 9,501, or 66 per cent., were Hindus, and 4,402, or 31 per cent., Musalm\u0101ns. The R\u0101j R\u0101n\u0101\u2019s palace is enclosed by a high masonry wall forming a square, with large circular bastions at each corner, and two semicircular ones in the centre of each side of the square. The principal entrance is on the eastern side, and the approach to it is along the main street of the bazar running due east and west. About a mile to the south-west is a sheet of water, below which are several gardens, and in one of these is the summer residence of the chief, surrounded by a canal filled with water from the tank. The sanitation, lighting, water-supply, and roads of the chhaoni are looked after by a municipal committee which was established about 1876\u20137. The receipts, derived mainly from the rent of State houses and shops and the sale of unclaimed property, average about Rs. 5,000 yearly, and the expenditure is slightly less. Besides the palace, law courts, and public offices, the town contains a combined post and telegraph office, a Central jail, a couple of schools, and a hospital. The jail has accommodation for 164 prisoners, and the daily average number in 1904 was 79. The prisoners are employed in making carpets, blankets, cotton cloth, shoes,\n&c., and in printing, bookbinding, and gardening. The jail costs about Rs. 6,200 a year, and the manufactures bring in about Rs. 1,150. Of the schools, one is for boys and the other for girls. The former is a high school, with a daily average attendance in 1904-5 of 164. The hospital has accommodation for 14 in-patients.\n\nJh\u0101lr\u0101p\u0101tan Town (locally called P\u0101tan).\u2014Head-quarters of the P\u0101tan tahsil and the commercial capital of the State of Jh\u0101law\u0101r, R\u0101jput\u0101na, situated in 24\u00b0 32' N. and 76\u00b0 10' E., at the foot of a low range of hills and on the left bank of a stream known as the Chandrabh\u0101ga. Population (1901), 7,955. Several modes of deriving the name are current. Some say the word means the 'city of bells,' and that the old town was so called because it contained 108 temples with bells; others that it is the 'city' (p\u0101tan) of 'springs' (jh\u0101lra), the latter abounding in the rivulet above mentioned; while others again say that the word jh\u0101lra refers to the R\u0101jput clan (Jh\u0101la), to which the founder of the new town belonged. The town possesses a combined post and telegraph office, a small lock-up for prisoners sentenced to short terms, a vernacular school attended by about 57 boys, and a dispensary for out-patients.\n\nA little to the south of the present town there formerly existed a city called Chandr\u0101vati, said to have been built by R\u0101j\u0101 Chandra Sena of M\u0101lw\u0101, who, according to Abul Fazl, was the immediate successor of the famous Vikram\u0101ditya. General Cunningham visited the site in 1864-5, and wrote:\n\n'Of its antiquity there can be no doubt, as I obtained several specimens of old cast copper coins without legends, besides a few of the still more ancient square pieces of silver which probably range as high as from 500 to 1000 B.C. These coins are, perhaps, sufficient to show that the place was occupied long before the time of Chandra Sena; but as none of the existing ruins would appear to be older than the sixth or seventh century A.D., it is not improbable that the city may have been refounded by Chandra Sena, and named after himself Chandr\u0101vati. I think it nearly certain that it must have been the capital of Ptolemy's district of Sandrabatis, and, if so, the tradition which assigns its foundation to the beginning of the Christian era would seem to be correct.'\n\nThis ancient city is said to have been destroyed, and its temples despoiled, in the time of Aurangzeb, and the principal remains are now clustered together on the northern bank of the Chandrabh\u0101ga stream. The largest and the earliest of these is the celebrated lingam temple of S\u012btaleswar Mah\u0101deva, which Mr. Fergusson described as 'the most elegant specimen of columnar architecture' that he had seen in India, an opinion fully concurred in by General Cunningham. The date of this temple was put by them at about A.D. 600. It was just to the\nnorth of these remains that Z\u0101lim Singh, the famous minister of Kotah, founded the present town in 1796, including within its limits the temple of S\u0101t Saheli (or 'seven damsels') and a Jain temple which formerly belonged to the old city. To encourage inhabitants, Z\u0101lim Singh is said to have placed a large stone tablet in the centre of the chief bazar, on which was engraved a promise that new settlers would be excused the payment of customs dues, and would be fined no more than Rs. 14-0 for whatever crime convicted. These privileges were annulled in 1850, when the K\u0101md\u0101r (minister) of Mah\u0101r\u0101j R\u0101n\u0101 Prithwi Singh had the tablet removed, and thrown into a tank, whence it was dug out about 1876.\n\nAccording to Tod, the town was placed under municipal government at its foundation in 1796, but the fact is not mentioned on the stone tablet above referred to. The present municipal committee was formed about 1876, and attends to the lighting and sanitation of the place, besides disposing of petty cases relating to easements. The income and expenditure are respectively about Rs. 1,000 and Rs. 2,000 yearly, the difference being provided by the State. The town is well and compactly built, and is surrounded on all sides save the west by a substantial masonry wall with circular bastions. The streets are wide and regular, intersecting each other at right angles, and contain many large and handsome buildings. On the west is a lake formed by a solid masonry dam, about two-thirds of a mile long, on which stand sundry temples and buildings, and the lands in the neighbourhood and the well-shaded gardens within and around the town walls are irrigated by means of a canal about 2 miles long.\n\n[J.

Population (1901), 6,444. Under Akbar it was the headquarters of a mah\u0101l or pargana. It is administered under Act XX of 1856, with an income of about Rs. 1,000. It contains a primary school with 113 pupils, and three aided schools with 62 boys and 35 girls.\n\nJh\u0101mpodad.\u2014Petty State in K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r, Bombay.\n\nJhang District.\u2014District in the Mult\u0101n Division of the Punjab, lying between 30\u00b0 35' and 32\u00b0 4' N. and 71\u00b0 37' and 73\u00b0 31' E., with an area of 6,652 square miles. It is bounded on the north-west by the District of Sh\u0101hpur; on the north-east by Sh\u0101hpur and Gujr\u0101nw\u0101la; on the south-east by Montgomery; on the south by Mult\u0101n and Muzaffargarh; and on the west by Mi\u0101nw\u0101li. It consists of an\nirregular triangle, artificially constituted for administrative purposes from portions of three separate tracts. Its eastern half embraces a large part of the dorsal ridge in the Rechna Do\u0101b; thence it stretches across the Chen\u0101b into the wedge of land between that river and the Jhelum, whose waters join the Chen\u0101b a few miles below the town of Jhang; while westward again the boundary runs, beyond the joint river, some distance into the Thal or desert of the Sind-S\u0101gar Do\u0101b. Southward the District stretches almost to the confluence of the Chen\u0101b with the R\u0101vi, but does not actually reach the latter river. Along the rivers are strips of fertile lowland, rising with a more or less defined bank into the uplands of the Do\u0101bs. The B\u0101r or upland plain of the Rechna Do\u0101b, until recently a desert inhabited only by nomad tribes, has been changed into one of the most fertile tracts in India by the Chen\u0101b Canal. The nomads of the B\u0101r and immigrants from other parts of the Province have been settled on the newly irrigated land; and, for the proper administration of the tract, it has been found necessary to divide Jhang District into two, the eastern and south-eastern portions being formed into a separate District with its head-quarters at Lyallpur. The present article, for the most part, describes Jhang as it existed before the change.\n\nNorth-west of the Chen\u0101b, the upland, which runs like a wedge between the lowlands of the Chen\u0101b and Jhelum, and was once a desert like the B\u0101r of the Rechna Do\u0101b, is being fertilized by the Jhelum Canal. West of the Jhelum river the alluvial plain after a few miles rises abruptly into the desert of the Sind-S\u0101gar Thal. With the exception of some isolated low hills on either side of the Chen\u0101b at Kir\u0101na and Chiniot, the District is almost flat.\n\nJhang consists entirely of alluvium, with the exception of two small patches of quartzite which form the Kir\u0101na and Chiniot hills. These are geologically interesting, as probably belonging to the Alwar quartzite of the Delhi system, and thus constituting the most northerly known outcrops of rocks of Peninsular type.\n\nBefore the foundation of the Chen\u0101b Canal and Colony, the District was the B\u0101r tract par excellence; but the flora of that tract is fast giving way to close cultivation, and saltworts are being driven out by irrigation. The annual weeds, however, are still mainly those of the West Punjab flora. Along the rivers are found the usual coverts (belas) of reed-grasses (Saccharum, &c.) and the lesser tamarisks (jhau and pilchi). The date-palm is grown near the Jhelum, but the produce is usually inferior.\n\nThe wolf, hyena, and wild cat are found in decreasing numbers as cultivation advances. Wild hog and \u2018ravine deer\u2019 (Indian gazelle) are confined to the wilder parts of the lowlands.\nThe climate of Jhang is that of the South-West Punjab, the rainless tract comprising Mult\u0101n, Montgomery, and Dera Ismail Kh\u0101n, which is said to have the highest mean temperature in India between June and August. The dry air makes the District unusually healthy, except in the canal tracts, where it is malarious and trying to Europeans. The annual rainfall is light, ranging from 8 inches at Shorkot to 11 at Chiniot.\n\nThe Districts of Jhang and Montgomery were the scene of Alexander\u2019s operations against the Malli in 325 B.C., and Shorkot has been identified by some authorities with one of the towns captured by him during the campaign. After his withdrawal, the country seems to have come successively under the sway of the Mauryas (c. 321\u2013231 B.C.), the Graeco-Bactrians (c. 190 B.C.), the Indo-Parthians (c. 138 B.C.), and the Kushans or Indo-Scythians (c. A.D. 100\u2013250). About A.D. 500 it was conquered by the White Huns, whose capital of S\u0101kala should, according to recent authorities, be identified with Chiniot or Sh\u0101hkot, a village in Gujranw\u0101la District, or with Si\u0101lkot. Their power was short-lived, and at the time of Hiuen Tsiang\u2019s visit (A.D. 630) the District was included in the kingdom of Tsekhia, the capital of which was close to S\u0101kala. In the tenth century it was subject to the Br\u0101hman kings of Ohind and the Punjab, and under the Mughals it was included in the S\u016bbah of Lahore.\n\nIn modern times the history of Jhang centres in the tribe of the Si\u0101ls, who ruled over a large tract between Sh\u0101hpur and Mult\u0101n, with little dependence on the imperial court at Delhi, until they finally fell before the power of Ranjit Singh. The Si\u0101ls are Muhammadans of Rajput descent, whose ancestor, Rai Shankar of D\u0101r\u0101nagar, migrated early in the thirteenth century from the Gangetic Do\u0101b to Jaunpur. His son, Si\u0101l, in 1243 left his adopted city for the Punjab, then overrun by Mongol hordes. Such emigrations appear to have occurred frequently at the time, owing to the unsettled state of Northern India. During his wanderings in search of a home, Si\u0101l fell in with the famous Muhammadan saint B\u0101ba Far\u012bd-ud-d\u012bn Shakarganj, of P\u0101kpattan, whose eloquence converted him to the faith of Isl\u0101m. He afterwards sojourned for a while at Si\u0101lkot, where he built a fort, but finally settled down and married at Sahiw\u0101l, in Sh\u0101hpur District. It must be confessed, however, that his history and that of his descendants bear somewhat the character of eponymous myths. M\u0101nik, sixth in descent from Si\u0101l, founded the town of Manker\u0101 in 1380; and his great-grandson, Mal Kh\u0101n, built Jhang Si\u0101l on the Chen\u0101b in 1462. Four years later, Mal Kh\u0101n presented himself at Lahore, in obedience to a summons, and obtained the territory of Jhang as an hereditary possession, subject to a payment of tribute to the imperial treasury. His family continued to rule at Jhang, with the dynastic quarrels and massacres usual in Indian annals, till the beginning of the last century.\nMeanwhile the Sikh power had arisen in the north, and Karam Singh Dulu, a chief of the Bhangi confederacy, had conquered Chiniot. In 1803 Ranjit Singh took the fort there and marched on Jhang, but was bought off by Ahmad Kh\u0101n, the last of the Si\u0101l chieftains, on promise of a yearly tribute, amounting to Rs. 70,000 and a mare. Three years later, however, the Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101 again invaded Jhang with a large army, and took the fort, after a desperate resistance. Ahmad Kh\u0101n then fled to Mult\u0101n, and the Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101 farmed the territories of Jhang to Sard\u0101r Fateh Singh. Shortly afterwards, Ahmad Kh\u0101n returned with a force given him by Muzaffar Kh\u0101n, Naw\u0101b of Mult\u0101n, and recovered a large part of his previous dominions, which Ranjit Singh suffered him to retain on payment of the former tribute, as he found himself too busy elsewhere to attack Jhang. After his unsuccessful attempt on Mult\u0101n in 1810, the Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101 took Ahmad Kh\u0101n a prisoner to Lahore, as he suspected him of favouring his enemy, Muzaffar Kh\u0101n. He afterwards bestowed on him a j\u0101g\u012br, which descended to his son, In\u0101yat Kh\u0101n. On the death of the latter, his brother, Ismail Kh\u0101n, endeavoured to obtain succession to the j\u0101g\u012br, but failed through the opposition of Gul\u0101b Singh. In 1847, after the establishment of the British Agency at Lahore, the District came under its charge, and in 1848 Ismail Kh\u0101n rendered important services against the rebel chiefs, for which he received a small pension. During the Mutiny of 1857, the Si\u0101l leader again proved his loyalty by raising a force of cavalry and serving in person on the British side.\n\nThe presence of numerous mounds, especially in the south of the District, testifies to the former existence of a large and settled population. The remains which have received most attention are those at Shorkot, consisting of a huge mound of ruins surrounded by a wall of large-sized bricks. Most of the pre-Muhammadan coins that have been found here are of the Indo-Scythian period. The finest building in the District is the Sh\u0101hi Masjid at Chiniot, built in the reign of Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n.\n\nThe population of the District at the last three enumerations was: (1881) 399,703, (1891) 432,549, and (1901) 1,002,656. It increased by no less than 132 per cent. during the last decade, almost entirely owing to the opening of the Chen\u0101b Canal and the colonization of the canal tract. The District is divided into six tahsils: Jhang, Chiniot, Shorkot, Lyallpur, Samundri, and Toba Tek Singh. The head-quarters of each are at the place from which it is named. The towns are the municipalities of Jhang-Maghi\u0101na, the head-quarters of the District, Chiniot, and Lyallpur. The table on the next page gives the principal statistics of population in 1901.\n\nMuhammadans form 68 per cent. of the total population, Hindus\n24 per cent., and Sikhs 7 per cent. The density is only 150\u00b77 persons per square mile, which is considerably below the average (209) for the British Punjab. The language of the nomad tribes who originally inhabited the B\u0101r is called Jangli, a form of Western Punjabi. Every variety of Punjabi is represented among the colonists.\n\n| Tahsil.* | Area in square miles | Number of | Population | Population per square mile | Percentage of variation in population between 1891 and 1901 | Number of persons able to read and write |\n|----------|----------------------|-----------|------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Jhang    | 1,438                | 1         | 414        | 194,454                   | 135\u00b71                                           | 11,362                                 |\n| Chiniot  | 1,328                | 1         | 406        | 200,676                   | 151\u00b71                                           | 5,693                                  |\n| Shorkot  | 927                  | ...       | 177        | 95,136                    | 102\u00b76                                           | 5,923                                  |\n| Lyallpur | 1,084                | 1         | 255        | 229,421                   | 211\u00b76                                           | 6,593                                  |\n| Samundri | 1,053                | ...       | 310        | 157,285                   | 149\u00b73                                           | 3,526                                  |\n| Toba Tek Singh | 1,007 | ... | 334 | 125,684 | 124\u00b78 | + 131\u00b78 | 3,937 |\n| District total | 6,652 | 3 | 1,896 | 1,002,656 | 150\u00b77 | + 131\u00b78 | 36,134 |\n\nNote.\u2014The figures for the areas of tahsils are taken from revenue returns. The total District area is that given in the Census Report.\n\n* The tahsils of Lyallpur, Toba Tek Singh, and Samundri, with their boundaries somewhat modified, form the new district of LYALLPUR, which was constituted on December 1, 1904. Earlier in the same year, the Kirana Bar was transferred from Jhang to Shahpur, and subsequently villages were transferred from Toba Tek Singh to Jhang and from Chiniot to Lyallpur.\n\n\u2020 Not available owing to changes in tahsil boundaries since 1891.\n\nThe most numerous tribe is that of the Jats, who number 231,000, or 23 per cent. of the total population. Next to them in numerical strength come the Rajputs, numbering 90,000, and then the Arains with 62,000. Other important agricultural tribes are the Balochs (29,000), Khokhars (24,000), and Kambohs (11,000). The Saiyids number 10,000. The Aroras (68,000) are the strongest of the commercial classes, the Khattris returning 21,000. The Brahmins number 9,000. Of the artisan classes, the Julahas (weavers, 40,000), Kumbhars (potters, 32,000), Mochis (shoemakers and leather-workers, 29,000), Chamars (shoemakers and leather-workers, 23,000), Tarkhans (carpenters, 23,000), and Lohars (blacksmiths, 10,000) are the most important; and of the menials, the Chuhras and Musallis (sweepers and scavengers, 105,000), Machhis (fishermen, bakers, and water-carriers, 21,000), Nais (barbers, 13,000), and Dhobis (washermen, 10,000). Other castes worth mentioning in view of their numerical strength are the Mirasis (village minstrels, 16,000) and Fakirs (mendicants, 13,000). About 49 per cent. of the people are supported by agriculture.\n\nThe Church Missionary Society began work in the District in 1899, and has two stations, at Gojra and Toba Tek Singh. A considerable number of native Christians are scattered through the villages of the colony. At the last Census (1901) the number of Christians in the\ncolony was 8,672. The Church Missionary Society owns two villages: Montgomeryw\u0101l\u0101, the larger, where there is a native church, with a population of 1,021; and Bateman\u0101b\u0101d, with a population of 337. The Roman Catholics hold the villages of Khushpur, founded in 1899 (population, 1,084), and Francispur, founded in 1904. The American Reformed Presbyterians have a mission at Lyallpur established in 1894, and they were followed by the American United Presbyterians in 1896. A few Salvationists are settled at Lyallpur and the neighbouring villages.\n\nThe soil is an alluvial loam, more or less mixed with sand; but agricultural conditions depend not on distinctions of soil, but on the facilities afforded for irrigation, and less than one per cent. of the cultivation is unirrigated. At the same time the District, while not dependent on the rainfall, benefits largely by seasonable rain, which enables cultivation to be extended by supplementing the supply available from irrigation, and also secures an abundant supply of fodder.\n\nThe main agricultural statistics for 1903-4 are shown below, areas being in square miles:\n\n| Tahsil     | Total | Cultivated | Irrigated | Cultivable waste |\n|------------|-------|------------|-----------|------------------|\n| Jhang      | 1,414 | 401        | 340       | 891              |\n| Chiniot    | 1,311 | 474        | 400       | 745              |\n| Shorkot    | 917   | 214        | 157       | 638              |\n| Lyallpur   | 1,024 | 700        | 697       | 257              |\n| Samundri   | 962   | 649        | 649       | 265              |\n| Toba Tek Singh | 934 | 556        | 556       | 324              |\n| **Total**  | **6,562** | **2,994** | **2,799** | **3,120**         |\n\nMore than half the area of the District, or 3,531 square miles, is the property of Government. Of this area, nearly two-thirds is leased to crown tenants in the Chen\u0101b Colony, and a large portion of the remainder will soon be commanded by the Jhelum Canal and leased to tenants. The Thal alone will thus remain uncultivated. Nearly all the proprietary villages are held by communities of small peasant owners. The area in square miles under each of the principal food-grains in 1903-4 was: wheat, 1,333; great millet, 170; and maize, 143. The principal non-food crop is cotton (354). Oilseeds covered 188 square miles.\n\nThe construction of the Chen\u0101b Canal has entirely revolutionized the agricultural conditions of the uplands between the Chen\u0101b and R\u0101vi, and the Jhelum Canal is doing the same for the B\u0101r north of the Jhelum. Thus the District, once one of the most sterile and thinly populated, is now one of the first in the Punjab, in both cultivation\nand population. The experimental farm at Lyallpur, established in 1901, is chiefly utilized for the study of Punjab crops, and their improvement by cross-fertilization and selection; but it has hardly been in existence long enough to produce any result as regards the quality of the crops generally grown in the District. In spite of the important part played by wells in the cultivation of the lowlands, loans for their construction are not popular. Twelve lakhs were advanced under the Land Improvement Loans Act during the five years ending 1901; but these advances were taken almost entirely by incoming colonists, to pay expenses due from them to Government under a system which has now been given up.\n\nBefore the introduction of canal-irrigation, the population of the B\u0101r was largely pastoral. The breed of cattle, however, was never greatly esteemed, and the large numbers now required for agricultural purposes are purchased from outside the District. Cattle fairs are held at Jhang and Lyallpur. The District is famous for its horses, and a good deal of horse-breeding is carried on. The Remount department keeps nine and the District board seven horse stallions, and the District contains more than 1,000 branded mares. Ten donkey stallions are kept by the Remount department and four by the District board. Important horse fairs are held at Lyallpur and Jhang. A large number of camels are bred, and many of the colonists are bound by the conditions of their grants to furnish camels for transport work when required. Sheep and goats are kept in large numbers.\n\nOf the total area cultivated in 1903\u20134, 2,799 square miles were irrigated, 453 square miles being supplied from wells, 23 from wells and canals, 2,319 from canals, and 4 from streams and tanks. In addition, 154 square miles, or 5 per cent. of the cultivated area, are subject to inundation from the rivers. The great mainstay of the District is the Chen\u0101b Canal. The greater part of the country irrigated by this canal was originally Government waste, and now forms part of the Chen\u0101b Colony, which occupies nearly half the total area of the District. In the colony canal-irrigation is but little supplemented by wells, and the old wells in the canal tract have mostly fallen into disuse. The District contains 15,980 masonry wells, chiefly found in the riverain lands, all worked with Persian wheels by cattle, besides 332 lever wells, water-lifts, and unbricked wells.\n\nThe District is devoid of true forests; but the Government waste, not included in the colony, which is under the control of the Deputy-Commissioner, is still extensive. The largest area is the Thal desert, in the Sind-S\u0101gar Do\u0101b, which covers about 400 square miles. A great deal of tree-planting has been done in the colony.\n\nThe only mineral product of any importance is the stone quarried from the Chiniot hills.\nThe town of Chiniot is famous for its carpentry and wood-carving, and ornamental articles of furniture are made of brass inlay and marquetry. Good saddlery and locks are made at Jhang and Maghi\u0101na, and a great deal of cotton cloth is woven throughout the District. Preparing raw cotton for export is a flourishing business; and the District contains 10 cotton-ginning factories, 6 cotton-presses, 5 combined ginning and pressing factories, a combined ginning factory and flour-mill, a combined press and flour-mill, an iron foundry, and a flour-mill. The iron foundry and the flour-mill, which are situated at Lyallpur, were closed in 1904, but the rest of the mills and factories mentioned employed 1,220 hands in that year. They are all situated within the Chen\u0101b Colony and also within the new Lyallpur District. Three of the ginning factories and one of the presses are at Chiniot Road, a small town that has sprung up at the railway station nearest Chiniot; and two of the combined ginning and pressing factories and the combined press and flour-mill are at Toba Tek Singh, while the rest are divided between LYALLPUR and GOJRA.\n\nThe town of Lyallpur is one of the chief centres of the wheat trade in India, and the District exports large quantities of wheat, cotton, oil-seeds, and other agricultural produce. Iron, timber, and piece-goods are the chief articles of import.\n\nThe Wazir\u0101b\u0101d-Kh\u0101new\u0101l branch of the North-Western Railway runs through the middle of the District, and carries the heavy export of agricultural produce from the Chen\u0101b Colony. The Southern Jech Do\u0101b Railway, which crosses the Chen\u0101b 10 miles above Jhang, joins the former line in the south of the District. It carries the produce of the villages irrigated by the Jhelum Canal, and places the town of Jhang in communication with the main line. The total length of metalled roads is 15 miles and of unmetalled roads 1,795 miles. Of these, 5 miles of metalled and 58 miles of unmetalled roads are under the Public Works department, and the rest are maintained by the District board. The Jhelum is crossed by nine ferries, and the Chen\u0101b by nineteen above and below its confluence with the Jhelum. There is but little traffic on these rivers.\n\nThere is no record of famine in Jhang District. Although the various droughts which have visited the Punjab in the past must have caused great mortality in cattle, famine on a large scale was impossible owing to the absence of unirrigated cultivation and the sparseness of the population. The construction of the Chen\u0101b Canal has now not only made the District able to support a large population in perfect security, but has turned it into the principal granary of the Province.\nThe District is in charge of a Deputy-Commissioner, aided by three Assistant or Extra-Assistant Commissioners, of whom one is in charge of the District treasury. The District, as now constituted, is divided into three tahsils, each in charge of a tahsildar.\n\nThe Deputy-Commissioner as District Magistrate is responsible for criminal justice. Judicial work is under a District Judge, and both officers are supervised by the Divisional Judge of the Sh\u0101hpur Civil Division, who is also Sessions Judge. There are three Munsifs, two at head-quarters and one at Chiniot, and one honorary magistrate. Cattle-theft is the commonest form of serious crime.\n\nThe Si\u0101l chiefs of Jhang appear to have taken a fourth of the produce in kind as their share. In 1831 S\u0101wan Mal\u2019s rule over the Mult\u0101n Province began. His system of combined cash and kind rents enhanced by numerous cesses is described in the article on Mult\u0101n District. The Kalow\u0101l tract, which lay west of the Chen\u0101b, was administered by R\u0101j\u0101 Gul\u0101b Singh; and as he exacted as much as he could in the shortest possible time, the development of this part of the District was greatly retarded.\n\nIn 1847\u20138 the first summary settlement was made before annexation. The basis was a reduction of 20 per cent. on the realizations of the Sikhs. At first the revenue was easily paid, but the sharp fall in prices which followed annexation caused great distress, and even desertion of the land. The second summary settlement, made in 1853, resulted in a reduction of 18 per cent. In Kalow\u0101l the first assessment had broken down utterly, and was revised in three days by the Commissioner, Mr. Thornton, who reduced the demand from one lakh to Rs. 75,000 in 1851. In 1853 he remitted Rs. 12,000 more, and the remaining Rs. 63,000 was easily paid.\n\nIn 1855 the regular settlement was begun. Government land was demarcated, a process simplified by the readiness of the people to part with their land and its burdens on any terms. The demand was fixed at 2 lakhs, while Kalow\u0101l (now in the Chiniot tahsil, but then a part of Sh\u0101hpur District) was assessed at Rs. 33,000. Generally speaking, the demand was easily and punctually paid. A revised settlement was carried out between 1874 and 1880, fixed assessments being sanctioned for the flooded lands of the Chen\u0101b and Jhelum, and a fluctuating assessment for the R\u0101vi villages, since transferred to Mult\u0101n District. In certain parts of the District each well was assessed at a fixed sum. The total demand was 3\u00b75 lakhs, an increase of 26 per cent. The rates of last settlement ranged from R. 0\u20138\u20130 to Rs. 1\u20136\u20134 on \u2018wet\u2019 land, the \u2018dry\u2019 rate being R. 0\u20138\u20130.\n\nDuring the currency of this settlement the enormous Government waste between the Chen\u0101b and R\u0101vi rivers, known as the Sandal B\u0101r,\nalmost the whole of which is at present included in Jhang District, has come under cultivation by the aid of the Chen\u0101b Canal. The present revenue rate in this tract is 8 annas per acre matured. The extension explains the recent enormous rise in the land revenue demand, which was 22\u00b73 lakhs in 1903-4, almost the whole of the fluctuating demand being realized from the new cultivation in the Sandal B\u0101r. The administration of the Government land was under a separate Colonization officer until 1907, but the old proprietary villages of the District came again under settlement in 1901. It was estimated that an increase of Rs. 1,12,000 would be taken; but this will probably be largely exceeded, owing to extensions of the Chen\u0101b Canal and to the introduction of canal-irrigation on the right bank of the Chen\u0101b from the Jhelum Canal.\n\nThe collections of land revenue alone and of total revenue are shown below, in thousands of rupees:\n\n|                | 1880-1 | 1890-1 | 1900-1 | 1903-4 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Land revenue   | 4,39   | 4,84   | 16,47  | 18,78  |\n| Total revenue  | 5,26   | 6,16   | 22,24  | 26,35  |\n\nThe District contains the three municipalities of Jhang-Maghi\u0101na, Chiniot, and Lyallpur, and the three 'notified areas' of Ahmadpur, Shorkot, and Gojra. Outside these, local affairs are entrusted to the District board. The income of the board, derived mainly from a local rate, was 3 lakhs in 1903-4, and the expenditure 2\u00b75 lakhs. The largest item of expenditure was public works.\n\nThe regular police force consists of 834 of all ranks, including 149 municipal police, under a Superintendent, who usually has 3 inspectors under him. The village watchmen number 815. There are 11 police stations, 3 outposts, and 10 road-posts. The District jail at head-quarters has accommodation for 302 prisoners.\n\nThe percentage of literate persons in 1901 was 3\u00b76 (6\u00b73 males and 0\u00b73 females), the District standing seventeenth among the twenty-eight Districts of the Province in this respect. The proportion is highest in the Jhang tahsil. The number of pupils under instruction was 2,243 in 1880-1, 4,686 in 1890-1, 6,108 in 1900-1, and 8,275 in 1903-4. In the last year the District possessed 5 secondary, 98 primary (public) schools, and one 'special' school, with 19 advanced and 210 elementary (private) schools. The proportion of girls is unusually large, there being 611 female scholars in the public, and 535 in the private schools. The only high school in the District is at Jhang town. The total expenditure on education in 1903-4 was Rs. 46,000, the greater part of which was met from Local funds and fees.\n\nBesides the civil hospital and branch dispensary at Jhang-Maghi\u0101na,\nthe District has 12 outlying dispensaries. In 1904 the number of cases treated was 132,374, of whom 2,201 were in-patients, and 6,395 operations were performed. The expenditure was Rs. 24,000, the greater part of which was contributed by Local and municipal funds.\n\nThe number of persons successfully vaccinated in 1903-4 was 30,073, representing 30 per 1,000 of the population. Vaccination is compulsory only in the municipality of Jhang-Maghi\u0101na.\n\n[D. C. J. Ibbetson, *Jhang District Gazetteer* (1883-4); and L. Leslie Jones, *Chen\u0101b Colony Gazetteer* (1905); E.

The Jhelum enters the tahsil on the north-west and the Chen\u0101b on the north-east, and they meet towards the south. The population in 1901 was 194,454. It contains the town of Jhang-Maghi\u0101na (population, 24,382), the head-quarters, and 448 villages. The land revenue and cesses in 1905-6 amounted to Rs. 2,56,000. The tahsil extends into the Chen\u0101b Colony on the east; and a strip of the Sandal B\u0101r, still in its pristine state, lies between the rich villages of this part and the cultivated lowlands on either side of the Chen\u0101b. Beyond these, waste alternates with cultivation, due to the farthest extensions of the Jhelum Canal, until the Jhelum lowlands are reached, studded with prosperous villages, situated among palm groves. The western border lies within the sandy desert of the Thal.\n\n**Jhang-Maghi\u0101na.**\u2014Head-quarters of the District and tahsil of Jhang, Punjab, situated in $31^\\circ 18'$ N. and $72^\\circ 20'$ E., on the Jech Do\u0101b extension of the North-Western Railway. Population (1901), 24,382, of whom 12,189 are Hindus and 11,684 Muhammadans. The towns of Jhang and Maghi\u0101na lie two miles apart, connected by metalled roads, but form a joint municipality. The Chen\u0101b flows at a distance of about three miles to the west; but in the hot season the Kharora branch of the river runs close past both towns, and with its fine avenue of trees, three miles long, and handsome masonry bathing gh\u0101ts, adds a peculiar beauty to the neighbourhood. The country round is well wooded, and fine gardens abound. An inundation canal leaves the Kharora branch of the Chen\u0101b near Jhang, and, passing round Maghi\u0101na, empties itself into the same branch after a course of 5 miles. Maghi\u0101na lies on the edge of the highlands, overlooking the alluvial valley of the Chen\u0101b, while the older town of Jhang occupies the lowlands at its foot. Jhang is said to have been founded in the fifteenth century, and to have been destroyed by the river and refounded in the reign of Aurangzeb. It was taken by Ranjit Singh in 1805. The Government offices and establishments have now been\nremoved to the higher site, and commerce has almost deserted Jhang, which is no longer a place of importance. Jhang-Maghi\u0101na was constituted a municipality in 1867. The income during the ten years ending 1902-3 averaged Rs. 46,800, and the expenditure Rs. 44,200. In 1903-4 the income was Rs. 49,700, mainly derived from octroi; and the expenditure was Rs. 50,200. Maghi\u0101na has a considerable trade in grain and country cloth, and manufactures leather, soap, locks and other brass-work. There is a civil hospital at Maghi\u0101na, and a high school and a dispensary at Jhang.\n\nJhanida.\u2014Subdivision and village in Jessore District, Bengal. See JHENIDA.\n\nJhanjharpur.\u2014Village in the Madhuban\u012b subdivision of Darbhanga District, Bengal, situated in 26\u00b0 16' N. and 86\u00b0 17' E., on the Bengal North-Western Railway. Population (1901), 5,639. Its brass utensils, particularly the p\u0101nbatta or box for holding betel-leaf and the gang\u0101jali or water-pot, have a local reputation.\n\nJhansi District.\u2014South-western District of the Allahabad Division, United Provinces, lying between 24\u00b0 11' and 25\u00b0 50' N. and 78\u00b0 10' and 79\u00b0 25' E., with an area of 3,628 square miles. The District consists of two portions, each roughly shaped like a pear, which are connected by a narrow strip of country. The northern portion lies east and west, and is bounded on the north by the States of Gwalior and Samthar and by J\u0101laun District; on the east by the Dhas\u0101n river, which separates it from Ham\u012brpur and from portions of the smaller Bundelkhand States; on the south by the State of Orchh\u0101; and on the west by the States of Datia, Gwalior, and Khani\u0101dh\u0101n\u0101. The southern boundary is extremely irregular, incorporating several enclaves of Native territory, while British villages are also enclosed in the adjacent States. The southern portion, which lies north and south, is bounded on the west by the Betw\u0101 river, which separates it from Gwalior; on the south by the Saugor District of the Central Provinces; and on the east by the Dhas\u0101n and Jamni rivers, which divide it from the Bundelkhand States. The District presents a great variety in its physical aspects, and includes some of the most beautiful scenery in the Provinces. The highest ground is in the extreme south, which extends to the two outer scarps of the Vindhyan plateau, running from the Betw\u0101 in a south-easterly direction and gradually breaking up into a confused mass of hills, parts of which approach a height of 2,000 feet above sea-level. Below the second scarp an undulating plain of black soil, interspersed with scattered hills and scored by numerous drainage channels, stretches north beyond the town of Lalitpur, and gradually becomes more rocky. Low red hills of gneiss then appear, with long ridges running from south-west to north-east. These continue in the northern portion of the District, especi-\nally east of the Betw\u0101, but gradually sink into another plain of dark soil. The slope of the country is from south-west to north-east, and the rivers flow generally in the same direction. The Betw\u0101 is the most considerable river, and after forming the western boundary of the southern portion divides it from the northern half, which it then crosses. Its principal tributaries, the Jamni and Dhas\u0101n, form the eastern boundaries of the southern and northern parts of the District. The Pah\u016bj is a small stream west of the Betw\u0101. A striking feature of the Dhas\u0101n and of the Betw\u0101, especially on the left bank, is the labyrinth of wild deep ravines, sometimes stretching 2 or 3 miles away from the river. The numerous artificial lakes formed by embanking valleys add to the natural beauty of the scenery. The largest are at T\u0101lbahat, Barw\u0101 S\u0101gar, Arj\u0101r, Pachw\u0101r\u0101, and Magarw\u0101r\u0101.\n\nThe oldest rock is gneiss, which occupies the greater part of the District. It forms the massive granitic ridges described above, which are traversed by gigantic quartz reefs, and often crossed at right angles by basic dikes of dolerite or diabase. South of Lalitpur the Upper Vindhyan massive sandstones, with a bed of Kaimur conglomerate near the base, rest directly on the gneiss, but in places the Bij\u0101war and Lower Vindhyan series intervene. The former of these includes sandstones, limestones, and slates, some of the beds containing a rich hematitic ore, while copper has been found in small quantities. The Lower Vindh yans consist principally of sandstone and shale. The fringe of the great spread of basalt constituting the M\u0101lw\u0101 trap just reaches the extreme south-east of the District, while a few outlying patches are found farther north, and the cretaceous sandstones of the Lameta group, which often underlie the trap, are met near the basalt\u00b9.\n\nThe flora of the District resembles that of Central India. A considerable area is \u2018reserved\u2019 or \u2018protected\u2019 forest, which will be described later; but there is a serious deficiency of timber trees, and the general appearance is that of low scrub jungle. Grazing is abundant, except in unusually dry years.\n\nIn the more level portion of the District, hog, antelope, and nilgai do great damage to the crops. Leopards, chital, s\u0101mbhar, hyenas, wolves, and occasionally a lynx are found in the northern hills, while farther south tigers, bears, wild dogs, and the four-horned antelope are met with, and at rare intervals a wild buffalo is seen. Bustard, partridge, sand-grouse, quail, and plover are the commonest game-birds, while snipe, duck, and geese haunt the marshy places and lakes in the cold season. Mahseer and other kinds of fish abound in the larger rivers.\n\nThe climate of the District is hot and very dry, as there is little shade and the radiation from bare rocks and arid wastes is excessive. It is,\n\n\u00b9 H. B. Medlicott, Memoirs, Geological Survey of India, vol. ii, pt. i.\nhowever, not unhealthy, except in the autumn; and during the rains and short cold season the climate is far from unpleasant. In the south, owing to its greater elevation, the temperature is slightly lower than in the northern part.\n\nThe annual rainfall averages about 31 inches, ranging from 34 inches in the north-west to about 41 in the south-east. In 1868-9 the fall amounted to only 15 inches, but in 1894-5 it was nearly 60 inches. The seasonable distribution of the rain is, however, of more importance than large variations in the total amount. Disastrous hailstorms are common in the cold season, and nearly 100 head of cattle were killed in a single storm in 1895.\n\nJhansi forms part of the tract known as British Bundelkhand, and its history is that of the Chandel and Bundela dynasties which once ruled that area. The earliest traditions point to the occupation of the northern portion by Parih\u0101r and K\u0101th\u012b Rajputs, and of the south by Gonds. The Chandels of Mahoba rose into power east of this District in the ninth century, but extended their power over it in the eleventh century, and have left many memorials of their rule in temples and ornamental tanks. After the defeat of the last great Chandel R\u0101j\u0101 by Prithwi R\u0101j in 1182, and the raids of the Muhammadans under Kutb-ud-din in 1202-3 and Altamsh in 1234, the country relapsed into anarchy. The Khang\u0101rs, an aboriginal tribe, who are said to have been the servants of the Chandels and are now represented by a menial caste, held the tract for some time and built the fort of Kar\u0101r, which stands just outside the British border in the Orchh\u0101 State. The Bundelas rose to power in the thirteenth or fourteenth century and expelled the Khang\u0101rs. One of their chiefs, named Rudra Prat\u0101p, was recognized by B\u0101bar, and his son, Bharti Chand, founded the city of Orchh\u0101 in 1531. The Bundela power gradually extended over the whole of this District and the adjacent territory, and the authority of the Mughals was directly challenged. In the early part of the seventeenth century the Orchh\u0101 State was ruled by Bir Singh Deo, who built the fort at Jhansi. He incurred the heavy displeasure of Akbar by the murder of Abul Fazl, the emperor's favourite minister and historian, at the instigation of prince Sal\u012bm, afterwards the emperor Jah\u0101ng\u012br. A force was accordingly sent against him, which was defeated in 1602. On the accession of Jah\u0101ng\u012br in 1605, Bir Singh was pardoned and rose to great favour; but when, on the death of the emperor in 1627, Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n mounted the throne, Bir Singh revolted again. The rebellion was unsuccessful, and Bir Singh died shortly after. The south of the District had already fallen into the hands of another descendant of Rudra Prat\u0101p, who founded the State of Chanderi. In the latter half of the seventeenth century a third Bundela State was founded east of the District by Champat Rai, whose\nson, Chhatars\u0101l, extended his authority over part of Jh\u0101nsi. On his death, about 1734, the Mar\u0101th\u0101s obtained the greater part of the District under his will, and in 1742 forcibly extorted most of the remainder from the R\u0101j\u0101 of Orchh\u0101. Jh\u0101nsi remained under the Peshw\u0101s for some thirty years, though in the south the R\u0101j\u0101s of Chander\u012b still maintained partial independence. After that period the Mar\u0101th\u0101 governors of the north of the District made themselves independent in all but name. In 1817 the Peshw\u0101 ceded to the East India Company his sovereign rights over the whole of Bundelkhand, and in the same year Government recognized the hereditary title of the Mar\u0101th\u0101 governor and his descendants to their existing possessions. The title of R\u0101j\u0101 was granted to the Jh\u0101nsi house in 1832 for services rendered in connexion with the siege of Bharatpur. In 1839 the Political Agent in Bundelkhand was obliged to assume the administration in the interests of civil order, pending the decision of a dispute as to succession; and the management was not restored till 1842, when most of the District was entrusted to R\u0101j\u0101 Gang\u0101dhar Rao. The R\u0101j\u0101 died childless in 1853, when his territories lapsed to the British Government and were formed into a District of Jh\u0101nsi. Meanwhile the Chander\u012b State, which comprised the south of the District and some territory west of the Betw\u0101, had also been acquired. A dissolute and inefficient ruler, named M\u016br Pahl\u0101d, who had succeeded in 1802, was unable to control his vassal Th\u0101kurs, who made constant plundering expeditions into the neighbouring territory. In 1811 their incursions on the villages of Gwalior provoked Sindhia to measures of retaliation, and M\u016br Pahl\u0101d was deposed, but received a grant of thirty-one villages. In 1829 another revolt was headed by the former R\u0101j\u0101. It was promptly suppressed, and the State was divided, M\u016br Pahl\u0101d receiving one-third. In 1844, after the battle of Mah\u0101r\u0101jpur, Sindhia ceded to the British Government all his share of the Chander\u012b State as a guarantee for the maintenance of the Gwalior Contingent. The territory so acquired was constituted a District called Chander\u012b, with the stipulation that the sovereignty of the R\u0101j\u0101 and the rights of the inhabitants should be respected.\n\nIn 1857 there was considerable discontent in both the Jh\u0101nsi and Chander\u012b Districts. The widow of Gang\u0101dhar Rao was aggrieved, because she was not allowed to adopt an heir, and because the slaughter of cattle was permitted in Jh\u0101nsi territory. Mard\u0101n Singh, the R\u0101j\u0101 of B\u0101npur, had for some time resented the withholding of certain honours. The events of 1857 accordingly found the whole District ripe for rebellion. On June 5 a few men of the 12th Native Infantry seized a small fort in the cantonment containing the treasure and magazine. Many European officers were shot the same day. The remainder, who had taken refuge in the main fort, capitulated a few\ndays after and were massacred with their families, to the number of 66 persons, in spite of a promise of protection sworn on the Kor\u0101n and Ganges water. The R\u0101n\u012b then attempted to seize the supreme authority; but the usual anarchic quarrels arose between the rebels, and the whole country was plundered by the Orchh\u0101 leaders. The Bundel\u0101s also rose in the south; and Lalitpur, the head-quarters of the Chander\u012b District, was abandoned by the British officials, who suffered great hardships, but were not murdered. The R\u0101j\u0101 then asserted complete independence and extended his rule into parts of Saugor District, but was driven back to Chander\u012b by Sir Hugh Rose in January, 1858. On March 3 the British army forced the passes in the south of the District and marched north. Jh\u0101nsi was reached on March 20, and during the siege T\u0101nt\u012b\u0101 Top\u012b, who attempted a diversion, was completely defeated. The town was assaulted on April 3, and the fort was captured on the 5th. Sir Hugh Rose had been compelled to march forward to J\u0101laun District, leaving only a few troops at Jh\u0101nsi, and disturbances soon broke out again, and increased when news of the Gwalior revolution was received. The Mar\u0101th\u0101 chief of Gursarai, in the north of the District, held out for the British, and in July the B\u0101npur R\u0101j\u0101 gave himself up. The south and the west of the District, however, were not cleared till late in the year. In 1861 the name of the Chander\u012b District was changed to Lalitpur; and in the same year the portions of that District west of the Betw\u0101, together with Jh\u0101nsi town and fort, were ceded to Sindhia. In 1886 Jh\u0101nsi town and fort, with 58 villages, were made over to the British by Sindhia in exchange for the Gwalior fort, Mor\u0101r cantonment, and some other villages. The two Districts of Jh\u0101nsi and Lalitpur were united in 1891; but the area included in the latter forms an administrative subdivision.\n\nThe District is exceptionally rich in archaeological remains. Chandel memorials in the form of temples and other buildings are found in many places, among which may be mentioned Ch\u0101ndpur, Deogarh, D\u016bdh\u0101l, Lalitpur, Madanpur, and Siron. At Erachh (Ir\u00edch) the fragments of ancient buildings have been used in the construction of a fine mosque, which dates from 1412.\n\nJh\u0101nsi District contains 9 towns and 1,331 villages. Population had been increasing steadily for some time, but received a check in the series of bad years between 1891 and 1901. The numbers at the last four enumerations were as follows:\n\n(1872) 530,487, (1881) 624,953, (1891) 683,619, and (1901) 616,759.\n\nThere are six taluk\u0101s\u2014Jh\u0101nsi, Mau, Garauth\u0101, Moth, Lalitpur, and Mahron\u012b\u2014the head-quarters of each being at a place of the same name. The principal towns are the municipalities of Jh\u0101nsi, the administrative head-quarters of the District, Mau-R\u0101n\u012bpur, and Lalit-\n\nVOL.

Muhammadans. Jains number 10,760, forming 1.7 per cent. of the total\u2014a higher proportion than in any other District of the United Provinces. The density of population is lower than in any part of the United Provinces, except the Kumaun Division, and the District suffered heavily from famine in 1895-7 and again in 1900. More than 99 per cent. of the people speak Western Hindi, chiefly of the Bundeli dialect.\n\nCham\u0101rs (leather-dressers and cultivators), 76,000, are the most numerous Hindu caste, followed by K\u0101chhis (cultivators), 58,000; Br\u0101hmans, 58,000; Ahirs (graziers and cultivators), 52,000; Lodhas (agriculturists), 47,000; and R\u0101jputs, 35,000. Among castes peculiar to this part of India may be mentioned the Khang\u0101rs (9,000), Basors (9,000), and Sahari\u0101s (7,000); the two former being menials, and the last a jungle tribe. Shaikhs (13,000) are the most important Musalm\u0101n tribe. About 56 per cent. of the total population are supported by agriculture and 8 per cent. by general labour. R\u0101jputs, Br\u0101hmans, Ahirs, Lodhas, and Kurmis are the chief proprietary castes, the first named being largely of the Bundel\u0101 clan.\n\nIn 1901 there were 777 native Christians, of whom 355 belonged to the Anglican communion and 267 were Roman Catholics. The Church Missionary Society has had a station at Jhansi since 1858, and the American Presbyterian Mission since 1886.\n\nThe characteristic feature of Jhansi, as of all the Bundelkhand Districts, is its liability to alternate cycles of agricultural prosperity and depression. It contains the usual soils found in this tract. M\u0101r and k\u0101bar are dark soils, the former being distinguished by its fertility and power of retaining moisture, while k\u0101bar is less fertile, becomes too sticky to plough when wet, and dries very quickly, splitting into hard blocks. Parw\u0101 is a brownish or yellowish soil more nearly resembling the loam of the Do\u0101b. M\u0101r, the commonest variety, covers a large area in the centre of both the\nnorthern and southern portions of the District, and is also found on the terraces of the Vindhyas. It produces excellent wheat in favourable seasons, but is liable to be thrown out of cultivation by the growth of *k\u0101ns* (*Saccharum spontaneum*). This is a tall thin grass which quickly spreads when tillage is relaxed; its roots reach a depth of 6 or 7 feet, and finally prevent the passage of the plough. After a period of ten or fifteen years *k\u0101ns* gradually gives way to other grasses, and the land can again be cultivated. In the neck of land which connects the two portions of the District, and for some distance south of the narrowest point, a red soil called *r\u0101kar patri* is found, which usually produces only an inferior millet. Interspersed among these tracts of poor soils little oases are found, generally near village sites and in valleys, which are carefully manured and regularly watered from wells sunk in the rock. The spring crops are peculiarly liable to attacks of rust in damp, cloudy weather. Along the rivers there is a little alluvial land, and near the lakes in some parts of the District rice can be grown. In the north-west, field embankments are commonly made, which hold up water for rice cultivation and also serve to stop the spread of *k\u0101ns*.\n\nThe greater part of the land is held on the usual tenures found in the United Provinces. In the Lalitpur subdivision nearly two-thirds of the whole area is included in *zam\u012bnd\u0101ri* estates, while *patt\u012bd\u0101ri* holdings are commoner in the rest of the District. A peculiar tenure, called *ub\u0101r\u012b*, is also found. This originated from grants of land given in lieu of a definite annual sum, or *hakk*. Where the annual value of the land granted exceeded the *hakk*, the excess (*ub\u0101r\u012b*) was paid as revenue. The tenure is thus equivalent to an abatement of the full revenue chargeable. Some of the *ub\u0101r\u012b* tenures, called *bat\u014dla*, date from the occupation of Chanderi by Sindhia and are not liable to resumption; but the others, which were mainly granted after the British occupation, are liable to be resumed for misconduct, on the death of an incumbent (though such resumptions are rare), or if any part of the *ub\u0101r\u012b* estate is transferred. The main agricultural statistics for 1903\u20134 are given below, in square miles:\n\n| Tahsil | Total | Cultivated | Irrigated | Cultivable waste |\n|--------|-------|------------|-----------|-----------------|\n| Jhansi | 499   | 171        | 28        | 180             |\n| Mau    | 439   | 190        | 13        | 149             |\n| Garauth\u0101 | 466 | 194        | ...       | 147             |\n| Moth   | 279   | 118        | 2         | 105             |\n| Lalitpur | 1,038 | 244        | 38        | 463             |\n| Mahron\u012b | 887   | 233        | 22        | 357             |\n| **Total** | **3,628** | **1,150** | **103** | **1,401** |\n\n**Note**\u2014Statistics for the Jhansi, Mau, and Moth tahsils are for 1902\u20133.\nJ\u014div\u0101r covered 326 square miles, kodon and other small millets 223, and gram 196. Wheat follows in importance with 89 square miles, and barley, rice, maize, and bajra are the remaining food-crops. Oilseeds were grown on 206, and cotton on 46 square miles.\n\nThe methods of cultivation in Bundelkhand are conspicuously poor, and the people easily yield to adverse circumstances. There has thus been no improvement in agricultural practice since the commencement of British rule. Within the last twenty years considerable loss has been caused by the introduction of artificial dyes in place of \u0101l (Morinda citrifolia). The \u0101l plant was grown on the best land, and required careful cultivation, which is the best preventive of a spread of k\u0101ns. The losses incurred by blight in 1893 and 1894 have also led to the replacement of wheat by the less valuable gram, but there has been a slight recovery. The steps taken to extend irrigation will be described later. Advances under the Land Improvement and Agriculturists' Loans Acts are freely taken, especially in bad seasons. A total of nearly 3 lakhs was advanced during the ten years ending 1900, and Rs. 60,000 in the next four years.\n\nThe cattle are smaller and hardier than in the Do\u0101b, but the best animals are imported from the neighbourhood of the Ken river or from Gwalior. Attempts were made to improve the breed about 1870; but the N\u0101gor and Hiss\u0101r bulls which were imported were too large and too delicate. There is no horse-breeding in the District, and the ponies are of a very poor type. Donkeys are extensively used as beasts of burden. The sheep are of the ordinary inferior kind; but the goats bred along the banks of the Dhas\u0101n are celebrated for their size and the quantity of milk which they give.\n\nIn years of well-distributed rainfall, m\u0101r and k\u0101bar require no artificial sources of irrigation. Thus in 1903-4 only 103 square miles were irrigated in the whole District. Wells supplied 91 square miles, tanks 7, and canals 3. The well-irrigation is chiefly found in the red-soil tracts of the Jh\u0101nsi tahsil and the northern part of the Lalipur subdivision. Tanks are very numerous, and the embankments of about thirty are maintained by the Public Works department, with 38 miles of small distributaries. New projects for making tanks are being carried out, and these serve a useful purpose by maintaining a high water-level, even where they are not used for irrigation directly. Much has already been done in repairing old embankments and in deepening lakes and improving the irrigation channels. A canal is taken from the Betw\u0101 at Par\u012bchh\u0101, where the river is dammed; but it irrigates a very small area in Jh\u0101nsi, chiefly serving J\u0101laun. A second dam is under construction higher up at Dukw\u0101, which will impound a further supply. Water from wells is usually raised by means of the Persian wheel.\nGovernment forests cover 189 square miles, of which 141 are situated in the Lalitpur subdivision. There is also a large area of private forest. The 'reserved' forests produce little timber; but they supply the wants of the villages in the neighbourhood, as well as some quantity of bamboos for export, and are of value for climatic reasons. Grass is especially important; and minor products, such as honey, lac, gun, catechu, and various fruits and roots, are also gathered by the jungle tribes. The chief trees include several kinds of acacia, *Adina cordifolia*, *Anogeissus latifolia*, *Diospyros melanoxylon*, *Grewia vestita*, various figs, *Lagerstroemia parviflora*, teak, and *Terminalia tomentosa*. The *mahu\u0101* (*Bassia latifolia*) grows well. During years of famine the forests are thrown open to grazing, and also supply roots and berries, which are eaten by the jungle tribes.\n\nThe most valuable mineral product is building stone, which is quarried from the Upper Vindhyan sandstone, and exported. Steatite is worked in one place, and iron is smelted after indigenous methods in a few small furnaces. The roads are largely metalled with disintegrated gneiss.\n\nCoarse cotton cloth, called *kh\u0101ru\u0101*, is still woven at a number of places; and at Erachh more ornamental articles, such as chintz and large kerchiefs dyed with spots, are turned out. Small woollen rugs are made at Jh\u0101nsi, and some good silk is woven at the same place. Mau, Jh\u0101nsi, and Maraur\u0101 are noted for brass work. The railway workshops at Jh\u0101nsi city employed 2,169 hands in 1903, and there are a small cotton-gin and an ice factory.\n\nThe most valuable exports of the District are oilseeds, *gh\u016b*, and *p\u0101n*. Grass, minor forest products, and road metal are also exported, and hay was baled in large quantities for the Military Department during the Tirah expedition of 1895 and the South African War. There is no surplus of grain, except in very prosperous years. Sugar, salt, kerosene oil, and grain are the chief imports. Jh\u0101nsi city, Mau-R\u0101nipur, Lalitpur, and Chirgaon are the principal trade centres, and Cawnpore and Bombay absorb most of the trade. There is, however, a considerable amount of local traffic with the adjacent Native States, and also some through trade.\n\nJh\u0101nsi city has become an important railway centre. The main line of the Indian Midland Railway (now amalgamated with the Great Indian Peninsula) enters the south of the District, and divides into two branches at Jh\u0101nsi, one running north-west to Agra and the other north-east to Cawnpore. A branch line from Jh\u0101nsi crosses the southeast of the northern division of the District. There are 1,295 miles of roads, a greater length than in any other District of the United Provinces. Of the total, 340 miles are metalled and are maintained by the\nPublic Works department, but the cost of 160 miles is charged to Local funds. There are avenues of trees along 364 miles. The principal routes are: the road from Cawnpore to Saugor through Jhansi and Lalitpur, which traverses the District from end to end; and the roads from Jhansi to Gwalior on the north-west, and to Nowgong on the south-east.\n\nThe District is specially exposed to blights, droughts, floods, hailstorms, and their natural consequence, famine, which is generally accompanied by disastrous epidemics of fever and cholera. No details are known of the famines which must have periodically devastated this tract; but it is commonly said that famine may be expected in Bundelkhand every fifth year. The first serious famine after the Mutiny occurred in 1868-9, and it was probably the worst in the century. The rains of 1868 ceased prematurely and the autumn harvest was almost a complete failure. Poorhouses were opened, and subsequently relief works were started, which took the form of roads, bridges, and irrigation embankments in Jhansi District, and the excavation of tanks and construction of embankments in Lalitpur. The total expenditure on this form of relief was nearly 3 lakhs, and the number of workers at one time rose above 26,000. Epidemics of small-pox and cholera followed; and the climax came when the rains of 1869 broke, and the roads, which were at that time unmetalled, became impassable. Excluding several partial losses of the harvest, the next great famine took place in 1896-7. Since the autumn of 1893 the autumn crops had been poor, and the spring crops even poorer, while kains had spread rapidly. The rains of 1895 were deficient, and relief works were opened in February, 1896. In May 42,000 persons were being relieved, and a terrible epidemic of cholera added to the loss of life. The works were almost abandoned by the middle of July, and up to the end of August prospects were fair. The monsoon, however, ceased abruptly, prices rose with alarming rapidity, and the relief works had to be reopened. The autumn was also marked by a virulent epidemic of fever, which attacked even the well-to-do. The distress became most acute in May, 1897, when nearly 100,000 persons were being relieved. Large suspensions and remissions of revenue were made, and relief works were closed in September, 1897. In 1899 a short rainfall again caused great distress in the red soil area, and the effects were increased by the high prices due to famine in Western India.\n\nThe tahsils of Lalitpur and Mahroni form the subdivision of Lalitpur, which is in charge of a member of the Indian Civil Service, assisted by a Deputy-Collector. The ordinary District staff consists of the Collector, a Joint-Magistrate, and three Deputy-Collectors recruited in India. The Forest officer is in charge of the whole of the Bundelkhand forest division.\nThere are two District Munsifs, and a Sub-Judge for civil work. The District and Sessions Judge has jurisdiction over the neighbouring District of J\u0101laun, and a Special Judge is at present engaged in inquiries under the Bundelkhand Encumbered Estates Act. The District is notorious for outbreaks of dacoity in bad times, and crimes of violence are not infrequent; but generally speaking, crime is light.\n\nUp to 1891 the present Lalitpur subdivision formed a separate District, and the fiscal history of the two portions of what is now the District of Jh\u0101nsi is thus distinct. After the lapse of Jh\u0101nsi in 1853 the three Districts of Jh\u0101nsi, Chander\u012b (or Lalitpur), and J\u0101laun were placed in charge of Deputy-Superintendents, under a Superintendent who was subordinate to the Commissioner of the Saugor and Nerbudda Territories at Jubbulpore. In 1858 these Districts (including Hamirpur up to 1863) were detached from Jubbulpore and administered as a Division in the Province of Agra on the non-regulation system. Finally, in 1891, the Districts were included in the Allahabad Division and were brought under the ordinary laws, many of which had already been applied.\n\nIn Jh\u0101nsi District proper the Mar\u0101th\u0101 revenue system was ryotw\u0101ri, and the nominal demand was a rack rent, which could be paid only in very favourable seasons. Arrears were not, however, carried over from one year to another. The early settlements of those portions of the District which were acquired between 1842 and 1844 were of a summary nature, and only for short periods. The first regular settlement of the whole commenced with a survey in 1854, but was interrupted by the Mutiny and not completed till 1864. Proprietary rights had been partly introduced between 1839 and 1842, and the sale of land by decree of the civil courts followed in 1862. The settlement, which was made by several officers on different principles, resulted in an assessment of 4\u00b73 lakhs, as compared with a previous demand of 5\u00b76 lakhs, in addition to about Rs. 50,000 due on account of ub\u0101ris. The demand was undoubtedly reasonable; but the rigid system of collection and the freedom of sale of land were new ideas that were not grasped by the people. Some landowners had been in debt since the days of Mar\u0101th\u0101 rule. After the Mutiny, revenue was collected from many from whom it had already been extorted by the Orchh\u0101 or Jh\u0101nsi rebels. In 1867 the crops failed, and in 1868\u20139 there was famine and great loss of cattle. In 1872 many cattle were again lost from murrain. Although the settlement had appeared light, it became necessary to re-examine the condition of the District in 1876. After much discussion the Jh\u0101nsi Encumbered Estates Act (XVI of 1882) was passed, and a Special Judge appointed, who was empowered to examine claims and reduce excessive interest. The sale of a whole estate operated as a discharge in bankruptcy to extinguish all debt due. Altogether, 1,475\napplications were tried, and out of a total claim of 16.6 lakhs the Judge decreed 7.6 lakhs. More than 90 per cent. of the amount decreed was paid in full: namely, 12\u00bd per cent. in cash, 46 per cent. by loan from Government, and 32 per cent. by sale of land, only 9\u00bd per cent. being discharged under the insolvency clause. Many estates were cleared by sale of a portion only. A striking feature of the proceedings was the rapid rise in the value of land. The next revision of settlement was made between 1889 and 1892. This was carried out in the usual way by assessing on the actual rent-rolls, corrected where necessary by applying the rates ascertained for different classes of soil. The total revenue was raised from 4.9 to 5.5 lakhs.\n\nIn the Lalitpur District conditions were different, for zam\u012bnd\u0101ri rights existed, except where the Mar\u0101th\u0101s had extinguished them. The early British settlements were of a summary nature, and for short periods; and though nominally based on recorded rentals or customary rates, a system of auction to the highest bidder was sometimes followed, with disastrous results. The first regular settlement was commenced in 1853, but was interrupted by the Mutiny, and was not completed till 1869. The methods employed were a compromise between the valuation of villages by applying rates found to be paid for different classes of soil, and the valuation of the \u2018assets\u2019 actually recorded. The result was a reduction from 1.8 to 1.5 lakhs. This settlement came under revision in 1896, and the revenue was raised to 1.6 lakhs, though this was only to be reached by degrees, and the initial demand was 1.4 lakhs.\n\nThe revenue demand for the whole District was thus 7 lakhs when the famine of 1896\u20137 broke out. The special legislation of 1882 had only had a temporary effect, and the District has now been brought under the provisions of the Bundelkhand Encumbered Estates Act. The Land Alienation Act has also been applied, and transfers are restricted in the case of land held by agricultural tribes. Summary reductions of revenue brought down the demand to 6.3 lakhs in 1902\u20133, or less than 5 annas per acre, varying from 1 anna to nearly 12 annas in different parts. In 1903 a new settlement was commenced under the special system, by which the demand will be liable to revision every five years.\n\nCollections on account of land revenue and total revenue have been, in thousands of rupees:\n\n|        | 1880-1 | 1890-1 | 1900-1 | 1903-4 |\n|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Land revenue | 5.71   | 6.18   | 6.12   | 6.34   |\n| Total revenue | 7.30   | 9.87   | 9.77   | 9.01   |\n\nThere are three municipalities, and six towns are administered under\nAct XX of 1856. Outside of these, local affairs are administered by the District board, which had an income of 1.7 lakhs in 1903-4, chiefly derived from a grant from Provincial revenues. The expenditure included a lakh devoted to roads and buildings.\n\nThe District Superintendent of police has two Assistants, one of whom is posted to Lalitpur. The ordinary force, which is distributed in 39 police stations, includes 7 inspectors, 185 subordinate officers, and 784 men, besides 215 municipal and town police, and 1,528 rural and road police. A Superintendent of Railway Police also has his headquarters at Jhansi city. The District jail contained a daily average of 267 prisoners in 1903.\n\nJhansi takes a high place in regard to the literacy of its inhabitants, of whom 4 per cent. (7.7 males and 0.3 females) could read and write in 1901. The number of public schools fell from 98 in 1880-1 to 85 in 1900-1, but the number of pupils increased from 2,537 to 2,962. In 1903-4 there were 167 such schools with 5,982 pupils, of whom 1,46 were girls, besides 39 private schools with 529 pupils. Two schools are managed by Government and 133 by the District and municipal boards. All the schools but two are primary. The total expenditure on education in 1903-4 was Rs. 41,000, of which Local funds provided Rs. 37,000, and fees Rs. 3,000.\n\nThere are 10 hospitals and dispensaries, with accommodation for 170 in-patients. About 62,000 cases were treated in 1903, including 1,383 in-patients, and 3,000 operations were performed. The total expenditure was Rs. 15,000, chiefly met from Local funds.\n\nIn 1903-4, 23,000 persons were successfully vaccinated, representing a proportion of 38 per 1,000 of population. Vaccination is compulsory only in the Jhansi cantonment and in the municipalities.\n\n[District Gazetteer (1874, under revision); W. H. L. Impey and J. S.

Population fell from 145,680 in 1891 to 145,371 in 1901, the rate of decrease being the lowest in the District. There are 210 villages and three towns, JHANSI (population, 55,724), the District and tahsil head-quarters, and BARWA SAGAR (6,355) being the largest. The demand for land revenue in 1903-4 was Rs. 1,20,000, and for cesses Rs. 21,000. The density of population, 291 persons per square mile, is considerably above the District average. This tahsil is the best and most stable in a very precarious District. The\nPahuj forms part of the western boundary; and the Betw\u0101, after flowing along the south-east, crosses Native territory and then traverses the northern portion of the tahsil, giving off the Betw\u0101 Canal. In the north lies a good tract of k\u0101bar or black soil and parw\u0101 or loam; this area is thickly populated and closely cultivated, while field embankments to hold up water are common. About the centre of the tahsil the country changes to a broken tract of hilly uplands, and the soil is stony and poor, but is manured near the village sites and irrigated from wells worked by the Persian wheel. Farther south jungle is more common, and the people depend largely on the pasturing of cattle. In 1902-3 the area under cultivation was 171 square miles, of which 28 were irrigated, chiefly from wells.\n\nJhansi City.\u2014Administrative head-quarters of the District and tahsil of the same name, with cantonment, in the United Provinces, situated in 25\u00b0 27' N. and 78\u00b0 35' E., on the road from Cawnpore to Saugor, and on the Great Indian Peninsula Railway; 799 miles by rail from Calcutta, and 702 from Bombay. Under Native rule the population of Jhansi was about 30,000 in 1872 and 33,000 in 1881. After its cession in 1886, population rose to 53,779 in 1891 and 55,724 in 1901. Hindus numbered 41,029 in 1901 and Musalmans 11,983, while there were about 2,000 Christians. The population in municipal limits was 47,881 and in cantonments 7,843.\n\nJhansi city, which is sometimes known as Balwantnagar, owes its foundation to Bir Singh Deo, R\u0101j\u0101 of Orchh\u0101, who built a fort here in 1613. A town sprang up and remained in the possession of the Bundel\u0101s till 1742, when it was seized by the Mar\u0101th\u0101s, who had already acquired property in the neighbourhood under the will of Chhatars\u0101l. They added to the fort, and the town continued to be the seat of a governor. The rapid growth of Jhansi during this period was partly due to the forcible removal of people from other places. It was subsequently held for a few months by Shuj\u0101-ud-daula, Naw\u0101b of Oudh, and was wrested from him by An\u016bp Giri Gosain of Moth, from whom it passed to the R\u0101j\u0101 of Orchh\u0101, and in 1766 was again brought under Mar\u0101th\u0101 rule. The British acquired sovereign rights from the Peshw\u0101 in 1817; and in 1853 the State of Jhansi lapsed in default of heirs, when the city became the head-quarters of a Superintendent subordinate to the Commissioner of the Saugor and Nerbudda Territories. The Mutiny history has been given in that of Jhansi District. In 1861 the city, with a large tract adjoining it, was ceded to Sindhia; and the head-quarters of the District, called Jhansi Nao\u0101b\u0101d ('newly-founded'), included only a small village, with the civil station and cantonment. Jhansi then became the head-quarters of a Subah of the Gwalior State, but in 1886 it was restored to the British in exchange for the Gwalior fort and Mor\u0101r cantonment.\nJhansi is picturesquely situated round the fort, which crowns a rocky hill. It is a walled city, but has lately been opened up by roads, and a spacious, handsome market-place, called Hardyganj after a recent District officer, has been constructed. An excellent water-supply is obtained from five large wells sunk in the rock towards the close of the eighteenth century. Besides the ordinary courts there are few public buildings, the finest being a hospital built a few years ago. There are many small temples, but none of striking appearance, and part of the old palace of the R\u0101j\u0101 is occupied by the police station and a school. Jhansi is the head-quarters of a Superintending and of an Executive Engineer in the Irrigation branch, and of an Executive Engineer in the Roads and Buildings branch. It is also the chief station of the Church Missionary Society and the American Presbyterian Mission in the District.\n\nA municipality was constituted in 1886. During the ten years ending 1901 the income and expenditure averaged Rs. 48,000 and Rs. 47,000 respectively. In 1903-4 the income was Rs. 73,000, chiefly from octroi (Rs. 56,000); and the expenditure was Rs. 68,000, including conservancy (Rs. 19,000), public safety (Rs. 12,000), administration and collection (Rs. 10,000), and roads and buildings (Rs. 4,000). The income and expenditure of cantonment funds during the ten years ending 1901 averaged Rs. 17,000, and in 1903-4 were Rs. 24,000 and Rs. 21,000 respectively. The usual garrison includes British and Native infantry, Native cavalry, and artillery. Jhansi is the chief centre in the District for the collection and distribution of agricultural products. Its trade has improved greatly with the extension of railways, which radiate from it in four different directions. There are also small manufactures of brass-ware, fine silk, and coarse rugs. The railway workshops employed over 2,000 hands in 1903, and a small cotton gin and ice factory are situated here. A private firm supplies hay pressed at Jhansi to the military authorities in many parts of the Eastern Command. The municipality maintains three schools and aids twelve others, with a total attendance of 994, besides the District school, which has about 160 pupils.\n\nJh\u0101nzi.\u2014River of Assam, which rises near Mokokchung in the N\u0101g\u0101 Hills, and, after a northerly course through Sibs\u0101gar District, falls into the Brahmaputra. Its total length is 71 miles, and in its course through the plains it forms the boundary between the subdivisions of Sibs\u0101gar and Jorh\u0101t. In the dry season it becomes very shallow, but during the rains boats of 4 tons burden can proceed as far as the foot of the hills. Molasses, tobacco, salt, oil, and other articles of commerce are brought up the river in the rains and sold or exchanged for betel-nuts. Tea used formerly to be sent downstream to Jh\u0101nzimukh, but most of it is now exported by rail. An area of\nabout 30 square miles in the Simaluguri mauza is injured by the floods of the river, but there are some compensating advantages, as the silt is said to have a fertilizing effect. The Jh\u0101nzi is crossed by a bridge on the Assam-Bengal Railway, and by four ferries.\n\n**Jhari\u0101.**\u2014Coal-field in M\u0101nbh\u016bm District, Bengal. See M\u0101nbh\u016bm.\n\n**Jhelum District (Jehlam).**\u2014District in the R\u0101walpindi Division of the Punjab, lying between $32^\\circ 27'$ and $33^\\circ 15'$ N. and $72^\\circ 32'$ and $73^\\circ 48'$ E., with an area of 2,813 square miles. Its length from east to west is 75 miles, its breadth increasing from 2 miles in the east to 55 in the west. It is bounded by the Districts of Sh\u0101hpur and Attock on the west, and by R\u0101walpindi on the north; while the Jhelum river separates it from Kashmir territory on the north-east, and from Gujrat and Sh\u0101hpur on the south-east and south.\n\nThe District falls naturally into three divisions. Of these the north-eastern, which includes the Chawk\u0101l tahsil and the narrow Pabbi tract in the north of the Jhelum tahsil, is a wide and fertile Physical aspects. plateau ranging from 1,300 to 1,900 feet above the sea, with a decided slope to the north-west, until at the Soh\u0101n river it reaches the boundary of the District. This plateau is intersected by numerous ravines, which, with the single exception of the Bunh\u0101 torrent on the east, drain into the Soh\u0101n. To the south it culminates in the Salt Range, which runs in two main ridges from east to west, now parallel, now converging, meeting in a confused mass of peaks east of Kat\u0101s and opening out again. Between these ranges is a succession of fertile and picturesque valleys, set in oval frames by the hills, never more than 5 miles in width and closed in at either end. The Salt Range runs at a uniform height of 2,500 feet till it culminates in the peak of Chail (3,701 feet). At the eastern end of the Salt Range two spurs diverge north-eastwards, dividing the Jhelum tahsil into three parallel tracts. The northernmost of these, the Pabbi, has already been described. The central tract, lying between the N\u012bl\u012b and the Tilla spurs, is called the Khuddar, or \u2018country of ravines.\u2019 The whole surface seems to have been crumpled up and distorted by converging forces from the north and south. Lastly, south of the Tilla range, lies the riverain tract, which extends along the river from Jhelum town in the north-east to the Sh\u0101hpur border. Broken only near Jal\u0101lpur by a projecting spur of the Salt Range proper, this fertile strip has a breadth of about 8 miles along the southern boundary of the Jhelum and Pind D\u0101dan Kh\u0101n tahsils.\n\nThe greater part of the District lies on the sandstones and conglomerates of the Siw\u0101lik series (Upper Tertiary), but towards the south the southern scarp of the Salt Range presents sections of sedimentary beds ranging from Cambrian upwards. The lowest bed contains the salt marl and rock-salt. The former is of unknown age,\nbut appears to be overlain by a purple sandstone, followed by shales containing Lower Cambrian fossils. These are again overlain by the magnesian sandstone and salt pseudomorph zone of the Punjab. The latter zone is followed by a boulder-bed and shales, and sandstones of Upper Carboniferous or Permian age, overlain by Lower Tertiary sandstone and Nummulitic limestone. In the eastern part of the Salt Range, the fossiliferous Productus limestone and ceratite beds are apparently absent, and there is a gap in the geological sequence between Lower Permian and Tertiary. Coal occurs in the Lower Tertiary beds at Dandot and B\u0101gh\u0101nw\u0101l\u0101.\n\nThe flora of the lower elevation is that of the Western Punjab; in the north-east the Outer Him\u0101laya is approached; while the Salt Range has a vegetation of its own which combines rather different elements, from the north-west Indian frontier to the hills east of Simla. Trees are rare, except where planted or naturalized, but the phul\u0101hi (Acacia modesta) is abundant in the hills and ravine country. At Khewra the salt outcrops have a special flora, found in similar places in Sh\u0101hpur and across the Indus.\n\nIn the hills hyenas, jackals, and a few wolves and leopards are found. The Salt Range is a favourite haunt of the ur\u0101l: \u2018ravine deer\u2019 (Indian gazelle) are plentiful in the western hills. Sand-grouse, partridge (black and grey), chikor, and s\u012bs\u012b are met with, and a great variety of wild-fowl haunt the Jhelum. Flocks of flamingo are found on the Kallar Kah\u0101r lake, and quail are not uncommon. Dhangrot on the Jhelum is a well-known place for mahseer fishing.\n\nThe climate is good. In the hills the heat is never extreme, though the adjoining submontane tract is one of the hottest in the Punjab. The rest of the District has the ordinary climate of the Western Punjab plains\u2014excessive heat for half the year, with a long and bracing cold season, and the usual feverish seasons. In the winter a bitter north wind prevails in the Salt Range and the northern plateau, light snow on the hills is not uncommon, and once or twice in a generation a heavier fall extends to other parts of the District. Here and there guinea-worm, due to bad water, severely affects the population. The annual rainfall varies from 16 inches at Pind D\u0101dan Kh\u0101n to 24 inches at Jhelum. Of the fall at Jhelum, 6 inches are received in winter and 18 inches in the summer months. The local distribution is very variable. The tracts at the foot of the Salt Range often remain dry while heavy rain is falling in the hills, and rain in the east of the Jhelum tahsil sometimes does not extend to the west.\n\nThe early annals of Jhelum present more points of interest than its\n\n---\n\n1 See \u2018Geology of the Salt Range,\u2019 Memoirs, Geological Survey of India, vol. xiv; C. S. Middlemiss, \u2018Geology of the Salt Range,\u2019 Records, Geological Survey of India, vol. xxiv, pt. i.\nrecords in modern times. Hindu tradition represents the Salt Range as the refuge of the P\u0101ndavas during the period of their exile, and every salient point in its scenery is connected with some legend of the national heroes. The conflict between Alexander and Porus probably took place in or near the present District, though the exact spot at which the Macedonian king effected the passage of the Jhelum (or Hydaspes) has been hotly disputed. Sir Alexander Cunningham supposed that the crossing was at Jal\u0101lpur, which he identified with the city of Bucephala; and that the battle with Porus\u2014a Greek corruption of the name Purusha.\u2014took place at Mong, on the Gujr\u0101t side, close to the field of Chili\u0101nw\u0101la. A later writer (Mr. V. A. Smith) holds that the battle-field was ten miles north-east of Jhelum town. When the brief light cast upon the country by Arrian and Curtius has been withdrawn, we have little information with reference to its condition until the Muhammadan conquest. In the interval it must have passed through much the same vicissitudes as the neighbouring District of Sh\u0101hpur.\n\nThe Janju\u0101s and Jats, who, along with other tribes, now hold the Salt Range and the northern plateau respectively, appear to have been the earliest inhabitants. The former are doubtless pure R\u0101jputs, while the Jats are perhaps their degenerate descendants. The Gakhars seem to represent an early wave of conquest from the west, and they still inhabit a large tract in the east of the District; while the Aw\u0101ns, who now cluster in the western plain, are apparently later invaders. The Gakhars were the dominant race at the period of the first Muhammadan incursions; and they long continued to retain their independence, both in Jhelum itself and in the neighbouring District of R\u0101walpindi. During the flourishing period of the Mughal dynasty, the Gakhar chieftains were among the most prosperous and loyal vassals of the house of B\u0101bar. But after the collapse of the Delhi empire, Jhelum fell, like its neighbours, under the sway of the Sikhs. In 1765 Gujar Singh defeated the last independent Gakhar prince, and reduced the wild mountaineers of the Salt Range and the Murree Hills to subjection. His son succeeded to his dominions until 1810, when he fell before the irresistible power of Ranjit Singh. Under the Lahore government the dominant classes of Jhelum suffered much from fiscal exactions; and the Janju\u0101, Gakhar, and Aw\u0101n families gradually lost their landed estates, which passed into the hands of their Jat dependants. The feudal power declined and slowly died out, so that at the present time hardly any of the older chieftains survive, while their modern representatives hold no higher post than that of village headman.\n\nIn 1849 Jhelum passed with the rest of the Sikh territories into the power of the British. Ranjit Singh, however, had so thoroughly\nsubjugated the wild mountain tribes who inhabited the District that little difficulty was experienced in reducing it to working order. In 1857 the 14th Native Infantry stationed at Jhelum town mutinied, and made a vigorous defence against a force sent from Rawalpindi to disarm them, but decamped on the night following the action, the main body being subsequently arrested by the Kashmir authorities, into whose territory they had escaped. No further disturbance took place. The subsequent history of Jhelum has been purely fiscal and administrative. On April 1, 1904, the tahsil of Talagang was detached from the District and incorporated with the new District of Attock.\n\nThe country is still studded with interesting relics of antiquity, among which the most noticeable are the ruined temples of Kat\u0101s, built about the eighth or ninth century A.D., and perhaps of Buddhist origin. Other religious ruins exist at Malot and Shivgang\u0101: at Jhelum town an old mound has yielded utensils of Greek shape, and the remains of an old Kashmiri temple; while the ancient forts of Roht\u0101s, Girjhak, and Kus\u0101k, standing on precipitous rocks in the Salt Range, are of deep interest for the military historian. Indeed, the position of Jhelum on the great north-western highway, by which so many conquerors have entered India, from the Greek to the Mughal, has necessarily made it a land of fortresses and guarded defiles, and has turned its people into hereditary warriors.\n\nThe population of the District at the last three enumerations was: (1881) 494,499, (1891) 514,090, and (1901) 501,424, dwelling in 4 towns and 888 villages. It decreased by 2.4 per cent. during the last decade. The District is divided into the three tahsils of Jhelum, Pind D\u0101dan Kh\u0101n, and Chakw\u0101l, the head-quarters of each being at the place from which it is named. The chief towns are the municipalities of Jhelum, the administrative head-quarters of the District, and Pind D\u0101dan Kh\u0101n. The following table shows the chief statistics of population in 1901:\n\n| Tahsil       | Area in square miles | Number of Towns | Villages | Population | Population per square mile | Percentage of variation in population between 1891 and 1901 | Number of persons able to read and write |\n|--------------|----------------------|-----------------|----------|------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Jhelum       | 903                  | 1               | 433      | 170,978    | 189.3                     | -3.4                                                     | 8,695                                  |\n| Chakw\u0101l      | 1,004                | 2               | 248      | 160,316    | 159.7                     | -2.8                                                     | 6,785                                  |\n| Pind D\u0101dan Kh\u0101n | 875              | 1               | 207      | 170,130    | 194.4                     | -1.7                                                     | 7,126                                  |\n| District total | 2,813              | 4               | 888      | 501,424    | 178.3                     | -9.4                                                     | 22,606                                 |\n\nNote.\u2014The figures for the areas of tahsils are taken from revenue returns. The total District area is that given in the Census Report.\n\nMuhammadans number 443,360, or 89 per cent. of the total:\nHindus, 43,693; and Sikhs, 13,950. The language of the people is Western Punjabi.\n\nThe most numerous tribe is that of the Jats, who number 73,000, or 14 per cent. of the total population. Next to them numerically are the Rajputs (53,000) and Awans (51,000). Other important agricultural castes are the Maliars (23,000), Mughals (21,000), Gujars (20,000), Gakhars (11,000), and Kahutas (10,000), the latter almost entirely confined to this District. Saiyids number 13,000. Of the commercial and money-lending classes, the most numerous are the Khattris (31,000), Aroras returning only 9,000. Brahmins number 5,000. Of the artisan classes, the Julahas (weavers, 23,000), Mochis (shoemakers and leather-workers, 19,000), Tarkhans (carpenters, 14,000), Kumhars (potters, 10,000), Lohars (blacksmiths, 8,000), and Telis (oil-pressers, 7,000) are the most important. Kashmiris number 12,000. The chief menial classes are the Musallis (sweepers, 18,000), Nais (barbers, 9,000), Machhis (fishermen, bakers, and water-carriers, 6,000), and Dhobis (washerwomen, 5,000). The Lilla Jats (1,000), an agricultural tribe found only in this District, also deserve mention. Of the whole population, 61 per cent. are supported by agriculture. The leading tribes\u2014Gakhars, Awans, Janjuas, and other Rajputs\u2014enlist freely in the Indian army.\n\nThe American United Presbyterian Mission has a branch at Jhelum town, where work was started in 1873, and the Roman Catholic missionaries maintain a school at Dalwal in the Salt Range. In 1901 the District contained 111 native Christians.\n\nThe area irrigated by artificial means is a tenth of that cultivated in the Pind Dadan Khan taluks, but only one per cent. in the Chakwal and Jhelum taluks. Cultivation thus depends on the local rainfall, eked out by the drainage from higher ground. The country is in parts seamed by torrent beds, and the soil varies from the infertile sand brought down by them to a rich loam and the stony soil of the hill-sides. In the greater part of the unirrigated land a spring crop is followed by an autumn crop; but the best land receiving drainage from higher ground is generally reserved for the spring, and in the tract under the hills in Pind Dadan Khan the lands for the autumn and spring harvests are kept separate.\n\nThe District is chiefly held by communities of small peasant proprietors, large estates covering only about 103 square miles. The area for which details are available from the revenue records of 1903-4 is 2,767 square miles, as shown on the next page.\n\nThe chief crops of the spring harvest are wheat, barley, gram, and oilseeds, the areas under which in 1903-4 were 477, 26, 34, and 80 square miles respectively; and in the autumn harvest, jowar, bajra, and pulses, which covered 16, 207, and 28 square miles respectively.\nBetween the settlements of 1864 and 1881 the cultivated area increased by 41 per cent., while the area cultivated at the settlement of 1901 showed an increase of 13 per cent. on that of 1881. The new cultivation of the last twenty years is, however, greatly inferior to the old, and there is but little prospect of further extension. Loans for the construction of wells are extremely popular, and Rs. 25,700 was advanced under the Land Improvement Loans Act in the District as now constituted during the five years ending 1904.\n\n| Tahsil     | Total | Cultivated | Irrigated | Cultivable waste | Forests |\n|------------|-------|------------|-----------|------------------|---------|\n| Jhelum     | 888   | 329        | 4         | 46               | 138     |\n| Chakw\u0101l    | 1,004 | 516        | 6         | 49               | 36      |\n| Pind D\u0101dan Kh\u0101n | 875 | 329        | 35        | 84               | 172     |\n| **Total**  | **2,767** | **1,174** | **45**    | **179**          | **346** |\n\nThe Dhanni breed of horses found in the Dhan or plateau north of the Salt Range has long been held in high estimation, being mentioned in the *Ain-i-Akbari*, while good horses are found all over the District. The Army Remount department maintains 4 horse and 11 donkey stallions, and the District board 2 horse stallions. The Dhanni breed of small cattle is also well-known. Camels are largely used for carrying burdens, but the breed is poor. Both the fat-tailed and ordinary sheep are kept, and the goats are of a fair quality.\n\nOf the total area cultivated in 1903-4, 45 square miles, or 3.8 per cent., were classed as irrigated by wells and canals. In addition, 47 square miles, or 4 per cent. of the cultivated area, are subject to inundation from the Jhelum. The wells, which number 4,781, are chiefly found along the river and in the level portion of the Jhelum tahsil; they are all worked by cattle with Persian wheels. Canal-irrigation is at present confined to two small cuts in the Pind D\u0101dan Kh\u0101n tahsil, one Government, the other private; but it is proposed to absorb the former in a larger canal commanding about 50,000 acres. The cultivation from the hill streams is unimportant, though where it exists no land is so profitable. Much of the unirrigated land is embanked and catches the drainage from higher ground.\n\nThe District contains 260 square miles of \u2018reserved\u2019 and 97 of unclassed forest under the Forest department, besides 43 square miles of unclassed forest and waste land under the Deputy-Commissioner, and one mile of military reserved forests. These consist mainly of the scattered scrub of *phul\u0101hi*, wild olive, *ukh\u0101nh*, and leafless caper, which clothe the hills. Some of the forest lands are stretches of alluvial grazing-ground, known as *bel\u0101s*, along the Jhelum. In 1904-5 the revenue from the forests under the Forest department was Rs. 82,000, and from those under the Deputy-Commissioner Rs. 9,000.\nSalt is found in large quantities in the Salt Range. It is excavated at Khewra and Nurpur, but outcrops are found in many places; and, in addition to the employ\u00e9s of the Khewra mines, a large preventive staff has to be maintained to prevent salt from being mined. Coal occurs in many places in the Salt Range. It is mined at Dandot by the North-Western Railway, and by a private firm at B\u0101gh\u0101nw\u0101la. Gypsum occurs in the marl beds above the salt strata of the Salt Range. Stone for road-making or railway ballast is plentiful, and good sandstone and limestone for building are frequently met with. Clay for pottery is also found. Fragments of copper and earthy iron hematites occur, but are quite unimportant. Sulphuret of lead or galena is found in small nodules in two or three localities. Quartz crystals are found in the gypsum of the Salt Range. Gold is washed in the beds of the torrents which flow into the Soh\u0101n, but the out-turn is insignificant.\n\nThe District possesses no arts or manufactures of any importance.\n\nTrade and communications. Boat-building is carried on at Jhelum and at Pind D\u0101dan Kh\u0101n, and brass vessels and silk lungis are made at the latter town. Water-mills are frequently used for grinding corn.\n\nJhelum town is an important timber d\u00e9p\u00f4t, being the winter headquarters of a Kashmir Forest officer who supervises the collection of the timber floated down the river. There is a large export of timber by both rail and river and of salt from Khewra, but otherwise the trade of the District is unimportant. Brass and copper ware is exported from Pind D\u0101dan Kh\u0101n. Stone is also exported, and in good seasons there is a considerable export of agricultural produce. The chief imports are piece-goods and iron. Jhelum town and Pind D\u0101dan Kh\u0101n are the centres of trade, and a considerable boat traffic starts from the latter place down the river. The completion of the railway system, however, has already ruined the trade of Pind D\u0101dan Kh\u0101n, and is fast reducing Jhelum town to the position of a local d\u00e9p\u00f4t.\n\nThe main line of the North-Western Railway traverses the east of the District, passing through Jhelum town, while the Sind-S\u0101gar branch runs through the south of the Pind D\u0101dan Kh\u0101n tahsil with a branch to Khewra, whence a light railway brings down coal from Dandot. A branch from the main line to Chakw\u0101l has been suggested, but has not been surveyed. Owing to the rugged nature of the country, the roads are not good. The only road used for wheeled traffic is the grand trunk road, which traverses the District by the side of the main line of rail; elsewhere pack animals are used. The only other route on which there is much traffic is that leading from Pind Dadan Kh\u0101n by Khewra to Chakw\u0101l. The Jhelum is navigable to about 10 miles above Jhelum town. It is crossed by a railway\nbridge with a track for wheeled traffic at Jhelum, by another with a footway only in the Pind D\u0101dan Kh\u0101n tahsil, and by fourteen minor ferries.\n\nThe District suffered from the great ch\u0101lisa famine of 1783, and there was famine in 1813 and 1834. Locusts did a great deal of damage in 1848. In 1860\u20131, though the scarcity in other parts of the Province caused prices to rise, the crops here did not fail to any serious extent. In 1896\u20137 there was considerable distress, and test works were started, but were not largely attended. The worst famine since annexation was that of 1899\u20131900. It was, however, more a fodder than a grain famine; and though there was acute distress and test works were opened, it was not considered necessary to turn them into famine works. The greatest daily number relieved in any week was 3,955, and the total expenditure was Rs. 39,000.\n\nThe District is divided into the three tahsils of Jhelum, Pind D\u0101dan Kh\u0101n, and Chakwal, each under a tahsildar and a naib-tahsildar. The Deputy-Commissioner is aided by three Assistant or Extra-Assistant Commissioners, of whom one is in charge of the Pind D\u0101dan Kh\u0101n subdivision and another of the District treasury.\n\nThe Deputy-Commissioner as District Magistrate is responsible for criminal justice. Civil judicial work is under a District Judge, and both officers are subordinate to the Divisional and Sessions Judge of the Jhelum Civil Division. There are three Munsifs, one at headquarters and one in each tahsil. The predominant form of crime is cattle-theft, while murders are also frequent.\n\nThe Sikh demand for land revenue cannot be shown with any accuracy. They took what they could get, but their average receipts during the last four years of their rule would seem to have been 7 lakhs. After the second Sikh War, when Jhelum passed into British possession, a summary settlement was made, yielding slightly less than the Sikh assessment. In 1852 a second summary settlement was undertaken, to correct the more obvious inequalities of the first. On the whole, both of these worked well, though some proprietors refused to pay the revenue fixed, and surrendered their proprietary rights. The first regular settlement, made in 1855\u201364, assumed half the net \u2018assets\u2019 as the share of Government, and fixed the demand at 6\u00bd lakhs. The next settlement (1874\u201381) raised the revenue by 18 per cent.; but this was easily paid, until a succession of bad harvests made large suspensions and some remissions necessary. In the present settlement (1895\u20131901) a further increase of 26 per cent. has been taken, but it is recognized that frequent suspensions will be needed. The average assessment on \u2018dry\u2019 land is Rs. 1\u20133 (maximum Rs. 2, minimum\n6 annas), and on 'wet' land Rs. 3-2 (maximum Rs. 5, minimum Rs. 1-4). The demand on account of land revenue and cesses in 1903-4 for the District as now constituted was 8-8 lakhs. The average size of a proprietary holding is 18 acres.\n\nThe collections of land revenue alone and of total revenue are shown below, in thousands of rupees:\n\n|                | 1880-1 | 1890-1 | 1900-1 | 1903-4 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Land revenue   | 7.88   | 6.50   | 4.19   | 9.89   |\n| Total revenue  | 9.70   | 8.50   | 7.47   | 13.47  |\n\nNote.\u2014These figures are for the District as constituted before the separation of the Talagang tahsil in 1904.\n\nThe District contains two municipalities, Jhelum and Pind Dadan Khan, and one 'notified area,' Chakwal. Outside these, local affairs are managed by the District board, the income of which is mainly derived from a local rate, and amounted in 1903-4 to Rs. 93,000. The expenditure was Rs. 88,000, the principal item being education.\n\nThe regular police force consists of 450 of all ranks, including 8 cantonment and 81 municipal police, and the Superintendent usually has 4 inspectors under him. Village watchmen number 615. There are 14 police stations and 2 road-posts. The District jail at headquarters has accommodation for 295 prisoners.\n\nThe District stands sixth among the twenty-eight Districts of the Province in respect of the literacy of its population. In 1901 the proportion of literate persons was 4.5 per cent. (8.5 males and 0.4 females). The number of pupils under instruction was 3,964 in 1880-1, 12,026 in 1890-1, 12,386 in 1900-1, and 14,869 in 1903-4. In 1904-5 the number of pupils in the District as now constituted was 12,144. In the same year the District contained 9 secondary and 95 primary (public) schools, and 3 advanced and 212 elementary (private) schools, with 454 girls in the public and 392 in the private schools. There are two Anglo-veracular high schools, at Jhelum town and Pind Dadan Khan. The total expenditure on education in 1904-5 was Rs. 54,000.\n\nBesides the civil hospital at Jhelum town, the District contains four outlying dispensaries. In 1904 a total of 76,560 out-patients and 1,451 in-patients were treated, and 2,859 operations were performed. The expenditure was Rs. 15,000, District funds contributing Rs. 6,000 and municipal funds Rs. 9,000. The American Presbyterian Mission also maintains a hospital at Jhelum.\n\nThe number of successful vaccinations in 1903-4 was 14,498, repre-\n\n1 All these figures apply to the District as constituted before the separation of the Talagang tahsil in 1904.\nsenting 28.9 per 1,000 of the population. The Vaccination Act has been extended to the towns of Jhelum and Pind D\u0101dan Kh\u0101n.\n\n[W. S. Talbot, *District Gazetteer* (in press); *Settlement Report* (1902); and *General Code of Tribal Custom in the Jhelum District* (1901).]\n\n**Jhelum Tahsil (Jehlam).**\u2014Eastern tahsil of Jhelum District, Punjab, lying between $32^\\circ 39'$ and $33^\\circ 15'$ N. and $73^\\circ 9'$ and $73^\\circ 48'$ E., with an area of 888 square miles. It is bounded on the east and south-east by the Jhelum river, which divides it from Kashmir and Gujrat District. The population in 1901 was 170,978, compared with 177,046 in 1891. The head-quarters are at the town of JHELUM (population, 14,951). It also contains 433 villages. The land revenue and cesses in 1903\u20134 amounted to 2.7 lakhs. The tahsil is traversed from south-west to north-east by two spurs of the Salt Range, the more easterly of which culminates in the peak of Tilla. Between this and the Jhelum river is an almost level alluvial plain of great fertility, while between the two spurs the country is seamed with ravines. The fort of Roht\u0101s is of historical interest.\n\n**Jhelum Town (Jehlam).**\u2014Head-quarters of the District and tahsil of Jhelum, Punjab, situated in $32^\\circ 56'$ N. and $73^\\circ 47'$ E., on the right bank of the Jhelum river and on the North-Western Railway; distant by rail 1,367 miles from Calcutta, 1,403 from Bombay, and 849 from Kar\u0101chi. Population (1901), 14,951. The present town is of modern origin, the old town, which may have been the Bucephala of Alexander, having been on the left or opposite bank of the river. Under Sikh rule the place was quite unimportant, being mainly occupied by a settlement of boatmen, and at the time of annexation contained about 500 houses. It was then chosen as the site of a cantonment, and as the head-quarters of the civil administration. For some years it was the seat of the Commissioner of the Division, but in 1859 his head-quarters were transferred to R\u0101walpindi. Under British rule Jhelum has steadily advanced in prosperity; and it is the entrep\u00f4t for most of the trade of the District, though, since the completion of the Sind-S\u0101gar branch of the North-Western Railway, the salt trade no longer passes through it. It is an important timber d\u00e9p\u00f4t, the timber from the Kashmir forests which is floated down the river being collected here. A good deal of boat-building is carried on. The cantonment, which is 3 miles from the civil station, contains the church and post office. The normal strength of the garrison is one Native cavalry and four Native infantry regiments. The municipality was founded in 1867. During the ten years ending 1902\u20133 the receipts averaged Rs. 32,100, and the expenditure Rs. 31,900. Receipts and expenditure from cantonment funds in the same period averaged Rs. 5,900 and Rs. 6,100, respectively. The income of the municipality in 1903\u20134 was Rs. 34,200, chiefly from\noctroi; and the expenditure was Rs. 41,000. The town possesses two Anglo-vernacular schools, a municipal high school, and a middle school maintained by the American Presbyterian Mission. Besides the civil hospital, the mission also maintains a hospital.\n\n**Jhelum (Jehlam).**\u2014River in Kashmir and the Punjab, being the most westerly of the five rivers from which the Punjab derives its name. It was known to the Muhammadan historians as the Bihat, Wihat, or Bihatab, corruptions of its Sanskrit name *Vitast\u0101* (which Alexander's historians graecized into *Hydaspes*, but Ptolemy more correctly as *Bidaspes*), while its modern Kashmiri name is *Veth*. It may be said to have its source in a noble spring of deep-blue water, which issues from the bottom of a high scarp of a mountain spur. The spring is known as Vern\u0101g; and at Kh\u0101nabal, 15 miles north, its waters join the streams of Adpat, Bring, and Sandran, and form the starting-point of navigation. The river is navigable without a single lock from Kh\u0101nabal to B\u0101ram\u016bla, 102 miles. In its course to the Wular Lake, which may be regarded as a delta of the river, the fall is 165 feet in the first 30 miles and 55 feet in the next 24 miles. From the Wular Lake to B\u0101ram\u016bla the fall is very slight.\n\nThe Jhelum river has many tributaries. On its right bank it receives the Liddar or Lambodri, which comes down from the everlasting snows overhanging the head of the Liddar valley, and from the mountain lake of Tarsar. Below Srinagar at Sh\u0101dipur\u2014the place of the marriage of the two rivers\u2014the Sind river joins the Jhelum; and beyond the Wular Lake the Pohru stream, which drains the Lol\u0101b valley, merges in the great river. On the left bank the chief tributaries are the Vishav, the Rembiara, the Ramshi, the Dudgang\u0101, the Sukn\u0101g, and the Ferozepura. The Dudgang\u0101 joins the Jhelum at the lower end of Srinagar city.\n\nBelow B\u0101ram\u016bla (5,000 feet) the placid Jhelum leaves the fertile banks of the valley, and rushes headlong down a deep gorge between lofty mountains of the Kazin\u0101g range on the north and an extension of the Pir Panj\u0101l on the south to Koh\u0101la, 2,000 feet. At Muzaffar\u0101b\u0101d the Kishangang\u0101 river joins the Jhelum on its right bank, while a few miles lower down, and on the same side, the Kunh\u0101r river, which drains the Haz\u0101ra country, adds no inconsiderable volume of water. Between Kh\u0101nabal and B\u0101ram\u016bla there are many bridges, but between B\u0101ram\u016bla and Domel, where the Kishangang\u0101 river joins the Jhelum, the bridges are scarce and primitive. Much of the internal commerce of Kashmir depends on the Jhelum. An account of the various descriptions of boats used is given in the article on Srinagar.\n\nBelow its junction with the Kishangang\u0101 the Jhelum forms the boundary between the Kashmir State and the British Districts of Haz\u0101ra and R\u0101walpindi, flowing in a narrow rocky bed, shut in by mountains\non either side. Numerous rapids here render navigation impossible, though large quantities of timber are floated down from Kashmir. A handsome suspension bridge at Koh\u0101la, in R\u0101walpindi District, connects Kashmir with British territory. Below Dangalli, 40 miles east of R\u0101walpindi, the Jhelum becomes navigable. Passing into Jhelum District, it skirts the outlying spurs of the Salt Range, receiving the waters of the Kahan, and finally debouches upon the plains a little above the town of Jhelum, about 250 miles from its source. Below the town, inundation of the lowlands begins to be possible, and sandy islands stud the wide bed of the stream. The Bunh\u0101, in the rains a roaring torrent which sometimes spreads over a mile of country, joins the Jhelum at D\u0101r\u0101pur. After a south-westerly course of more than 100 miles, during which the river divides the District of Jhelum from Gujr\u0101t and Sh\u0101hpur, it enters the latter District entirely, and trends thenceforth more directly southward. The width in this portion of its course averages 800 yards in flood, dwindling during the winter months to less than half that size. Sudden freshes occur after heavy rains, and cause frequent inundations over the lowlands, greatly increasing the productive power of the soil. The Jhelum next enters the District of Jhang, where it preserves the same general characteristics, but with a wider valley, bounded by the high uplands known as the B\u0101r. It finally joins the Chen\u0101b at Trimmu, in 31\u00b0 11' N. and 72\u00b0 12' E., 10 miles to the south of Maghi\u0101na, after a total course of not less than 450 miles, of which about 200 lie within British territory. The current in the plains has an average rate of 4 miles per hour. The wedge of land between the Jhelum and the Chen\u0101b is known as the Chaj Do\u0101b; while the tract stretching westward to the Indus bears the name of the Sind S\u0101gar Do\u0101b.\n\nThe principal towns upon the Jhelum are Kashmir or Sr\u012bnagar, Jhelum, Pind D\u0101dan Kh\u0101n, Mi\u0101ni, Bhera, and Khush\u0101b. According to General Cunningham, the point where Alexander crossed the Hydaspes may be identified with Jal\u0101lpur in Jhelum District; while nearly opposite, on the Gujr\u0101t bank, stands the modern battle-field of Chili\u0101nw\u0101la. Other writers hold that the passage was effected near Jhelum town. A bridge of boats crosses the river at Khush\u0101b. The permanent railway bridge of the North-Western Railway also crosses it at the town of Jhelum, and the Sind-S\u0101gar line at Haranpur. The Lower Jhelum Canal takes off at Mong Ras\u016bl in Gujr\u0101t District.\n\nJhelum Canal, Lower.\u2014A perennial irrigation work in the Punjab now approaching completion. It takes off from the left bank of the Jhelum river, and will eventually supply perennial irrigation to the whole of the country lying between the Jhelum and the Chen\u0101b, west of a line joining the town of Mi\u0101ni on the Jhelum with Pindi\nBhati\u0101n on the Chen\u0101b. The head of the canal is near the village of Mong Ras\u016bl in Gujr\u0101t District. The river is dammed by a weir 4,100 feet long, and a regulator across the head of the canal takes the form of a bridge of eight spans of $2\\frac{1}{2}$ feet each. The main line has a bed-width of 140 feet, and will have when running full a depth of 7.5 feet, and a discharge of 3,800 cubic feet per second, or twice that of the Thames at Teddington. The Sh\u0101hpur branch will take off at about the twenty-eighth mile of the main line. This branch has been designed to take up the irrigation now performed in Sh\u0101hpur District by the existing Imperial, Provincial, and privately-owned inundation canals. After a course of 39 miles, in which it gradually approaches the centre of the highlands of the Do\u0101b, the canal bifurcates into two main branches, watering the northern and southern portions of the Do\u0101b respectively. The total length of the main line and main branches is about 167 miles, and about 960 miles of distributing channels will be constructed. The canal will protect an area of 2,400 square miles, and is expected to irrigate annually about 1,200 square miles. Of the 2,400 square miles protected, about 850 are crown waste, which it is intended to turn into an immense horse-breeding colony for the supply of remounts to the Indian Army. For this purpose the greater portion has been leased out to colonists on the condition of their keeping an approved brood mare, and other areas have been reserved for public and private breeding establishments and horse runs. The work of colonization is under an officer of the Indian Civil Service, who has his head-quarters at Sargodha in Sh\u0101hpur District. The land has been divided into squares of nearly 28 acres each, and one brood mare has to be maintained for every $2\\frac{1}{2}$ squares.\n\nA railway has been constructed from Malakw\u0101l on the Sind-S\u0101gar line to Shorkot on the Lyallpur-Kh\u0101newal line, affording facilities for the immigration of colonists and the export of their produce.\n\nElaborate precautions have been taken to prevent waterlogging of the soil by over-irrigation. The depth at which spring-water is found below the surface of the ground has been carefully observed over the whole of the commanded area, and the country has been divided into three zones according to those depths. Where the spring-level is 40 feet or more below the surface, 50 per cent. of the gross area commanded may be irrigated; where the depth lies between 25 and 40 feet, 40 per cent. of the area will be irrigated; and where the water is nearer to the surface than 25 feet, only 25 per cent. will be allowed perennial irrigation, and powers have been reserved to reduce these supplies if they should be found to be in excess of requirements. On the Sh\u0101hpur branch 50 per cent. of the area will be irrigated.\n\nThe canal was opened on October 30, 1901; and irrigation is now well advanced, except on the Sh\u0101hpur branch, the construction of\nwhich has only just been commenced. It is estimated that this canal will cost when finished 187.5 lakhs, and will give a return of 15.8 per cent. on the capital spent upon it, and that ten years after completion the net revenue will exceed the interest charges by 192 lakhs.\n\n**Jhelum Colony.**\u2014Colony on the Jhelum Canal, in the District and tahsil of Sh\u0101hpur, Punjab. The total area to be irrigated from the Jhelum Canal amounts to 2,392 square miles, lying partly in Jhang and partly in Sh\u0101hpur District. Of this, 750 square miles of waste land in the B\u0101r or upland of the southern part of Sh\u0101hpur District belong to Government; and upon it colonists are being settled in villages, on the same terms as the colonists in the Chen\u0101b Colony, but the majority of grants have been made on the condition that a suitable mare is maintained for breeding purposes. Up to the end of 1904 about 231 square miles had been allotted to grantees. A large area has also been allotted for Imperial horse and mule runs and for regimental stud farms. The head-quarters of the colony are at Sargodha, the head-quarters of the new Sargodha tahsil, which is fast rising into an important town. It is connected by the new Jech Do\u0101b branch of the North-Western Railway with Malakw\u0101l on the Sind-S\u0101gar line, and with Sh\u0101hpur by a new metalled road. The railway is also being extended to Shorkot in Jhang District. Wells, roads, and markets are being built, and a complete system of feeder-roads is under construction.\n\n**Jhenida Subdivision.**\u2014North-western subdivision of Jessore District, Bengal, lying between 23\u00b0 22' and 23\u00b0 47' N. and 88\u00b0 57' and 89\u00b0 23' E., with an area of 475 square miles. The population in 1901 was 304,899, compared with 311,973 in 1891. It contains one town, Kotch\u0101ndpur (population, 9,065), and 864 villages. The head-quarters are at Jhenida. The subdivision is a flat, alluvial plain, the surface of which has been raised by the inundations of the Ganges distributary system till it is now beyond the reach of ordinary floods, and no longer receives the deposits of silt which formerly enriched it. It contains the most unhealthy portions of the District. The population has consequently receded, and the density is now 642 persons to the square mile. The principal marts are at Jhenida and Kotch\u0101ndpur.\n\n**Jhenida Village.**\u2014Head-quarters of the subdivision of the same name in Jessore District, Bengal, situated in 23\u00b0 33' N. and 89\u00b0 11' E., on the Nabagang\u0101 river, 28 miles north of Jessore town. Population (1901), 798. There is a large bazar, with a trade in sugar, rice, and pepper. Communication was formerly carried on chiefly by means of the river, but this has now to a great extent silted up, and is navigable only below the town and for three months in the year. Jhenida is connected by road with Chu\u0101d\u0101nga station on the Eastern Bengal\nState Railway. It contains the usual public offices; the sub-jail has accommodation for 11 prisoners.\n\n**Jher.**\u2014Petty State in Mah\u012b K\u0101nth\u0101, Bombay.\n\n**Jherri\u0101.**\u2014Coal-field in M\u0101nbh\u016bm District, Bengal. See M\u0101nbh\u016bm.\n\n**Jhingerg\u0101cha.**\u2014Village in the head-quarters subdivision of Jessore District, Bengal, situated in $23^\\circ 6'$ N. and $89^\\circ 8'$ E., on the Kabadak river. Population (1901), 736. Jhingerg\u0101cha is a station on the Eastern Bengal State Railway, and steamers ply between it and Kapilmuni in Khuln\u0101 District.\n\n**Jhinjh\u0101na.**\u2014Town in the Kair\u0101na tahsil of Muzaffarnagar District, United Provinces, situated in $29^\\circ 31'$ N. and $77^\\circ 13'$ E., on the left bank of the Kath\u0101, 30 miles from Muzaffarnagar town. Population (1901), 5,094. The town is the home of a family of Shaikhs who have resided here from an early date. It contains a darg\u0101h of a Muhammadan saint built in 1495 and several monuments of the Shaikhs, the chief being a mosque and tomb built in 1623, decorated with coloured tiles. Jhinjh\u0101na is administered under Act XX of 1856, with an income of about Rs. 1,700. It was formerly very dirty; and although the streets have recently been paved, it is still unhealthy.\n\n**Jhinjh\u016bv\u0101da.**\u2014Petty State in K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r, Bombay.\n\n**Jhiri.**\u2014River between Manipur State and C\u0101ch\u0101r District, Eastern Bengal and Assam. See Jiri.\n\n**Jh\u016bnjhunu.**\u2014Head-quarters of the tahsil of the same name and of the Shekh\u0101w\u0101t\u012b niz\u0101mat in the State of Jaipur, R\u0101jput\u0101na, situated in $28^\\circ 8'$ N. and $75^\\circ 23'$ E., about 90 miles north-by-north-west of Jaipur city. Population (1901), 12,279. The place was the head-quarters of the Shekh\u0101wati Brigade, a force maintained by the Darb\u0101r from 1836 to 1842 to preserve the peace, and now represented by the 13th R\u0101jputs (the Shekh\u0101wati Regiment). At the eastern end of the town is a suburb still called Forsterganj after the officer who raised and commanded the brigade. To the west is a hill 1,684 feet above sea-level and visible for miles round; it is said to have been seen with the naked eye from a distance of 95 miles. The town contains the mausoleum of Kamar-ud-din Sh\u0101h, the patron saint of the Kaimkh\u0101nis; a Jain temple said to be 1,000 years old; a combined post and telegraph office; 10 schools; and a hospital with accommodation for 4 in-patients.\n\n**Jh\u016bsi.**\u2014Town in the Ph\u016blpur tahsil of Allah\u0101b\u0101d District, United Provinces, situated in $25^\\circ 26'$ N. and $81^\\circ 54'$ E., on the Ganges, opposite its junction with the Jumna. Population (1901), 3,342. Jh\u016bsi has been identified with the Pratisth\u0101n or Kes\u012b of the Pur\u0101nic histories, which was the residence of Pur\u016bravas, first king of the Lunar dynasty and son of the moon. It was at one time called Harbongpur after the R\u0101j\u0101 Harbong, of whose vagaries and misrule many fables are told.\nIn the time of Akbar the town was known as H\u0101di\u0101b\u0101s. It has recently been suggested that Jh\u016bsi was the Kia-shi-pu-lo visited by Hiuen Tsiang. Two great mounds, once the site of forts, are the only visible remains; but gold coins of the Gupta kings, and a copperplate of Trilochna P\u0101la, dated in A.D. 1027, have been discovered here\u00b9.\n\nJh\u016bsi is administered under Act XX of 1856, with an income of about Rs. 500. There is a small school with 30 pupils.\n\n**Ji\u0101ganj.**\u2014Village in the L\u0101lb\u0101gh subdivision of Murshid\u0101b\u0101d District, Bengal, situated in 24\u00b0 15' N. and 88\u00b0 16' E., on the left bank of the Bh\u0101girathi, 3 miles north of Murshid\u0101b\u0101d city, and opposite Az\u012bmganj station on the East Indian Railway. Population (1901), 8,734. Though it has somewhat declined in importance, Ji\u0101ganj is still a large d\u00e9p\u00f4t where rice, jute, silk, sugar, and a small quantity of cotton are collected for export. A jute-press is at work here. Ji\u0101ganj, which is included within the Az\u012bmganj municipality, is connected with Az\u012bmganj by a ferry, and during the rainy season a steamer plies between it and Dhul\u012b\u0101n. It contains some large houses, the property of Jain merchants, many of whom dwell here, though the main colony lives in Az\u012bmganj.\n\n**Jign\u012b.**\u2014A petty sanad State in Central India, under the Bundelkhand Agency, with an area of about 22 square miles. Population (1901), 3,838. It is surrounded by portions of the Hamirpur and Jh\u0101nsi Districts of the United Provinces. The holders of the j\u0101g\u012br are Bundel\u0101 R\u0101jp\u016bts, the founder being Rao Padam Singh, a son of the famous Chhatars\u0101l, who acquired in 1730 the parganas of R\u0101sin and Badaus (now in Hamirpur District). The j\u0101g\u012br, originally a large one, was much reduced during the Mar\u0101th\u0101 invasion, Lachhman Singh managing to obtain only a grant of the two parganas of R\u0101th and Panw\u0101r\u012b from the invaders. When the British supremacy was established, Prithwi Singh, Lachhman's son, was in possession of fourteen villages, but in consequence of his contumacy they were attached. In 1810 the six villages which constitute the present holding were restored to him under a sanad. The present j\u0101g\u012brd\u0101r is Rao Bh\u0101nu Prat\u0101p Singh, a cousin of the Mah\u0101r\u0101ja of Charkh\u0101ri, who succeeded by adoption in 1892. Number of villages, 6; cultivated area, 9 square miles; revenue, Rs. 13,000. Jign\u012b, the chief town, is situated in 25\u00b0 45' N. and 79\u00b0 25' E., on the right bank of the Dhas\u0101n river, at the confluence of that stream and the Betw\u0101. Population (1901), 1,770.\n\n**Jind State.**\u2014One of the Ph\u016blk\u012b\u0101n States, Punjab. The State has a total area of 1,332\u00b2 square miles, and comprises three distinct tracts,\n\n\u00b9 *Indian Antiquary*, vol. xviii, p. 34.\n\u00b2 These figures do not agree with the area given in Table III of the article on the Punjab, and in the population table on p. 170 of this article, which is the area as returned in 1901, the year of the latest Census. They are taken from later returns.\ncorresponding to its three tahsils of Sangr\u016br, J\u012bnd, and D\u0101dri. The first, in which lies Sangr\u016br, the present capital of the State, is interspersed among the territories of the other Ph\u016blki\u0101n States, Pati\u0101la and N\u0101bha; the J\u012bnd tahsil, lying to the south-east of Sangr\u016br, is almost entirely surrounded by the British Districts of Karn\u0101l and Rohtak; while on the south of it, and separated from it by Rohtak District, lies the tahsil of D\u0101dri. Sangr\u016br lies in the great natural tract known as the Jangal; J\u012bnd is in the B\u0101ngar and includes a part of Kurukshetra, the sacred land of the Hindus; and D\u0101dri lies partly in the B\u0101gar, the desert on the R\u0101jput\u0101na border, and partly in Hari\u0101na.\n\nPhysical aspects. No great river traverses the State; but the Choya torrent passes through Sangr\u016br, and a still smaller stream, the Jhamb\u016bw\u0101li, and the Ghaggar river also enter that tahsil. In D\u0101dri a few villages are fertilized by the Doh\u0101n, a seasonal torrent which rises in Jaipur State and loses itself in Rohtak District. With the exception of some low hills, outliers of the Ar\u0101valli system, in the D\u0101dri tahsil, the State consists of level plains whose monotony is broken only in Sangr\u016br by shifting sandhills.\n\nThe flora corresponds (as regards the older parts of the State) with that of Karn\u0101l and Rohtak; in the D\u0101dri tahsil it is identical with the adjoining tracts of North-Eastern R\u0101jput\u0101na. The fauna is much the same as in the Pati\u0101la plains.\n\nOwing to the scattered character of the State, the climate is not uniform. The J\u012bnd tahsil is moist and unhealthy; D\u0101dri is dry, sandy, and healthy; and Sangr\u016br possesses the same characteristics in a less degree. The rainfall is heaviest in Sangr\u016br, where it averages 17 inches a year, while J\u012bnd receives about 12 inches. D\u0101dri has the lowest rainfall, 10 inches, and is the tract most subject to drought, the two other tahsils being now protected against famine by canals.\n\nThe history of J\u012bnd as a separate State dates from 1763, in which year the confederate Sikhs captured Sirhind town from the governor to whom Ahmad Sh\u0101h Durr\u0101ni had entrusted it, and partitioned the old Mughal province. The R\u0101j\u0101 of J\u012bnd is descended from Sukh Chain, a grandson of Ph\u016bl, the ancestor of all the Ph\u016blki\u0101n families, who had previously been a mere rural notable. On Sukh Chain\u2019s death in 1751 B\u0101l\u0101nw\u0101li, which he had founded, fell to Alam Singh his eldest son, Badrukh\u0101n to his second son Gajpat Singh, and Dy\u0101lpura to Bul\u0101ki. On Alam Singh\u2019s death in 1754 B\u0101l\u0101nw\u0101li also passed to Gajpat Singh, who was the most adventurous of the three brothers, and in 1755 conquered the imperial parganas of J\u012bnd and Safidon and overran P\u0101nipat and Karn\u0101l, but was not strong enough to hold them. In 1766 Gajpat Singh made J\u012bnd town his capital. Nevertheless he remained a vassal of the Delhi empire and continued to pay tribute, obtaining in return in 1772 an\nimperial farm\u0101n which gave him the title of R\u0101j\u0101. In 1774, in consequence of a quarrel with the R\u0101j\u0101 of N\u0101bha, he attacked Amloh, Bh\u0101dson, and Sangr\u016br, which were in the N\u0101bha territories; and though he was compelled by the R\u0101j\u0101 of Pati\u0101la to relinquish the first two places, he succeeded in retaining the last, which has ever since remained part of the Jind State. In the next year, the Delhi government made an attempt to recover Jind; but the Phulkian chiefs combined to resist the attack, which was repulsed. Gajpat Singh built a fort at Jind in 1775, and soon after this joined the R\u0101j\u0101 of Pati\u0101la in an invasion of Rohtak; but the Mughal power was strong enough to compel them to give up most of their conquests, though Jind retained Panjgirain. Again, in 1870, the allies marched on Meerut, but were defeated, and Gajpat Singh was taken prisoner by the Muhammadan general, his release being secured only by payment of a heavy ransom. He died in 1789, and was succeeded by two sons\u2014Bh\u0101g Singh, who inherited the title of R\u0101j\u0101 with the territories of Jind and Safidon; and Bhup Singh, who obtained Badrukh\u0101n.\n\nR\u0101j\u0101 Bh\u0101g Singh shrewdly held aloof from the combination against the British; and when Sindhia\u2019s power in Northern India was ultimately broken, Lord Lake rewarded him by confirming his title in the Goh\u0101na estates which had previously been farmed to him by the Mar\u0101th\u0101s. He afterwards accompanied Lord Lake as far as the Be\u0101s in his pursuit of Jaswant Rao Holkar, and was sent as an envoy to Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101 Ranjit Singh, who was the son of his sister R\u0101j Kaur, to dissuade him from assisting the fugitive prince. The mission was successful. Holkar was compelled to leave the Punjab, and Bh\u0101g Singh received as his reward the pargana of Baw\u0101na to the south-west of P\u0101nipat. The history of Ranjit Singh\u2019s interference in the Phulkian States has been given in the article on Pati\u0101la. From Ranjit Singh, R\u0101j\u0101 Bh\u0101g Singh received territory now included in Ludhi\u0101na District, comprising Jand\u0101l\u0101, Raikot, Bassi\u0101n, and Jagraon. He died in 1819 after ruling thirty-six years, and was succeeded by his son Fateh Singh, who died in 1822. Troublous times followed, and Sangat Singh, who succeeded his father Fateh Singh, was obliged for a period to desert his capital. He died childless in 1834; and the question of the succession was finally settled in 1837, when Sar\u016bp Singh of Bazidpur, a second cousin of the deceased R\u0101j\u0101, was recognized as chief of all the territory that had been held by his great-grandfather, Gajpat Singh, through whom he derived his title. The territory to which he thus succeeded consisted of Jind proper and nine other parganas, containing 322 villages, with a revenue of Rs. 2,36,000, while the acquisitions of the chiefs subsequent to Gajpat Singh, comprising territory yielding Rs. 1,82,000, were resumed by the British Government.\n\nBefore the outbreak of the first Sikh War the R\u0101j\u0101 of Jind was in\nclose alliance with Patiala against R\u0101j\u0101 Deoindar Singh of Nabha. His attitude to the British Government, however, was anything but friendly in 1845, until a timely fine recalled him to his allegiance. In the first Sikh War his conduct was exemplary, and he furnished both troops and supplies, receiving in reward a grant of land of the annual value of Rs. 3,000, while the fine of the previous year was remitted. Another grant, yielding Rs. 1,000, was shortly afterwards added, in consideration of the abolition of the State transit dues. In 1847 the R\u0101j\u0101 received a sanad by which the British Government engaged never to demand from him or his successors tribute or revenue, or commutation in lieu of troops; the R\u0101j\u0101 on his part promised to aid the British with all his resources in case of war, to maintain the military roads, and to suppress sati, slave-dealing, and infanticide in his territories. When the second Sikh War broke out, R\u0101j\u0101 Sar\u016bp Singh offered to lead his troops in person to join the army at Lahore. In the crisis of 1857 he rendered most valuable assistance. He occupied the cantonment of Karnal with 800 men, and held the ferry over the Jumna at B\u0101ghpat, 20 miles north of Delhi, thus enabling the Meerut force to join Sir H. Barnard's column. He was present at the battle of Alipur, but at the end of June was compelled to pay a flying visit to Jind, as the rebels of H\u0101nsi, Rohtak, and Hissar had induced some of his villages to revolt. He returned to Delhi on September 9, and his contingent took a prominent part in the final assault on the city. He was further active throughout in sending supplies to the besieging force, and in keeping open the lines of communication and preserving order in the districts adjoining his State. After the fall of Delhi he sent 200 men with General van Cortlandt to H\u0101nsi, and 110 more with Colonel R. Lawrence to Jhajjar, while 250 remained to garrison Rohtak. These splendid services received a fitting reward in the grant of the D\u0101dri territory, covering nearly 600 square miles, forfeited for disloyalty by the Naw\u0101b of Bah\u0101durgarh. This territory now yields a revenue of over 2 lakhs. He also received 13 villages, assessed at Rs. 1,38,000, in the Kul\u0101r\u0101n pargana, close to Sangr\u016br, where the R\u0101ja now has his capital, and a house at Delhi, valued at Rs. 6,000. His salute was raised to 11 guns; and, like the other Ph\u016blki\u0101n chiefs, he received a sanad granting him the right of adoption in case of the failure of natural heirs, and legalizing the appointment of a successor by the two other Ph\u016blki\u0101n chiefs, in concert with the Political Agent, in the event of the R\u0101j\u0101 dying without male issue and without having adopted a successor.\n\nR\u0101j\u0101 Sar\u016bp Singh died in 1864. He was succeeded by his son, Raghubir Singh, who was in every way worthy of his father. Immediately after his installation he was called upon to put down a serious insurrection in the newly-acquired territory of D\u0101dri. The people\nobjected to the new revenue assessment, which had been based upon the British system, though the rates were much heavier than those prevailing in the neighbouring British Districts. Fifty villages broke out in open revolt, but R\u0101j\u0101 Raghubir Singh lost no time in hurrying to the scene of the disturbances with about 2,000 men of all arms. The village of Charki, where the ringleaders of the rebellion had entrenched themselves, was carried by assault, and within six weeks of the outbreak the country was again perfectly quiet. The R\u0101j\u0101 rendered prompt assistance to the British Government on the occasion of the K\u016bka outbreak in 1872; and when the second Afghan War broke out in 1878, the British Government accepted his offer of a contingent, which rendered useful service on the line of communications. As a reward, the honorary title of R\u0101j\u0101-i-R\u0101jg\u0101n was conferred on the R\u0101j\u0101 of Jind in perpetuity. An offer of assistance in the Egyptian campaign of 1882 was declined, with a suitable recognition of the R\u0101j\u0101's loyalty. R\u0101j\u0101 Raghubir Singh was indefatigable in his efforts to promote the prosperity, material and otherwise, of his people. He rebuilt the town of Sangr\u016br, modelling it largely on Jaipur, and made many improvements at Jind, D\u0101dri, and Saf\u012bdon. It is largely owing to his efforts that Jind is to-day the first of the Ph\u016blkian States as regards artistic manufactures. He died in 1887, leaving a grandson, Ranbir Singh, to succeed him. R\u0101j\u0101 Ranbir Singh was only eight years old at his accession, and a Council of Regency was appointed to carry on the administration until he attained majority. Full powers were given him in November, 1899, in a darb\u0101r held at Sangr\u016br.\n\nThe southern portion of Kurukshetra lies within the boundaries of the State, but the antiquities of the tract have never been properly explored. There are several old buildings and tanks, especially in and around Saf\u012bdon, for which an antiquity is claimed coeval with the events of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata.\n\nThe State contains 7 towns and 439 villages, and its population at the last three enumerations was: (1881) 249,862, (1891) 284,560, and (1901) 282,003. The decrease of 1 per cent. during the last decade was due to famine, which caused considerable emigration from D\u0101dri. It is divided into two niz\u0101mats or administrative districts: Sangr\u016br, which comprises the tahsil of that name; and Jind, divided into the two tahsils of Jind and D\u0101dri. Their head-quarters are at Sangr\u016br and Jind respectively. The principal towns are Sangr\u016br, the modern capital, Jind, the former capital, Saf\u012bdon, D\u0101dri, and Kali\u0101na. The table on the next page shows the chief statistics of population in 1901.\n\nNearly three-fourths of the population are Hindus, only 10.6 per cent. being Sikhs, though Jind is one of the principal Sikh States in the Punjab. The remainder are Muhammadans (nearly 14 per\ncent.), with a few Jains in the D\u0101dri tahsil. The majority of the people speak B\u0101ngru, or its kindred dialects of B\u0101gri and Ah\u012brwati, Punjabi being spoken only in the Sangr\u016br tahsil.\n\n| Tahsil | Area in square miles | Number of Towns | Villages | Population | Population per square mile | Percentage of variation in population between 1891 and 1901 | Number of persons able to read and write |\n|--------|---------------------|----------------|----------|------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Sangr\u016br | 242                 | 2              | 95       | 64,681     | 267                       | + 8.6                                           | 3,142                            |\n| Jind    | 464                 | 2              | 163      | 124,954    | 269                       | + 0.9                                           | 2,679                            |\n| D\u0101dri   | 562                 | 3              | 181      | 92,368     | 164                       | - 8.7                                           | 2,008                            |\n| State total | 1,268            | 7              | 439      | 282,003    | 222                       | - 0.9                                           | 7,829                            |\n\nNote.\u2014The figures for the areas of tahsils are taken from revenue returns. The total area of the State is that given in the Census Report.\n\nMore than 33 per cent. of the population are J\u0101ts, the Sidhu tribe, to which the ruling family belongs, being strong in Sangr\u016br and the Sheor\u0101n in D\u0101dri. R\u0101jputs and Ah\u012brs also form important castes in D\u0101dri. The latter are exclusively Hindus. About 66 per cent. of the population are dependent on agriculture. A branch of the Reformed Presbyterian Mission is established at Sangr\u016br; and 80 Christians, mostly members of the railway community at Jind, were enumerated in the State in 1901.\n\nD\u0101dri tahsil is almost devoid of irrigation, and its conditions therefore differ completely from those of Sangr\u016br and Jind. Of these, Sangr\u016br is now commanded by the Sirhind Canal, and its agricultural system has in consequence undergone great changes, being now superior to that of Jind. Formerly an arid tract with sparse cultivation, its virgin soil has been rendered cultivable by the canal. Jind is irrigated from the H\u0101nsi branch of the older Western Jumna Canal, and its soil suffers both from excess of moisture and from exhaustion. D\u0101dri is an arid, sandy tract, exposed to violent dust-storms in the hot season, and the sowing of either harvest depends entirely on the seasonal rains.\n\nThe State is mostly held by communities of small peasant proprietors, though large estates cover about 400 square miles. The following table gives the main statistics of cultivation in 1903\u20134, areas being in square miles:\n\n| Tahsil | Total | Cultivated | Irrigated | Cultivable waste |\n|--------|-------|------------|-----------|------------------|\n| Sangr\u016br | 252   | 203        | 71        | 35               |\n| Jind    | 489   | 386        | 77        | 38               |\n| D\u0101dri   | 591   | 238        | 14        | 39               |\n| Total   | 1,332 | 827        | 162       | 112              |\nIn Sangr\u016br and Jind the principal harvest is the spring crop, in which wheat and barley and gram, mixed with mustard, are grown, cotton and sugar-cane (and in Sangr\u016br maize) being cultivated for the autumn harvest. In D\u0101dri wheat is rarely sown except on lands irrigated from wells, and the main harvest is in the autumn, when millet is the staple crop. Pulses are sown with millet, which is also grown to some extent in Jind. Gram is the staple crop of the spring harvest.\n\nIn the Jind tahsil rent is taken either in cash or by division of produce. Cash rents vary from Rs. 1-3-3 to Rs. 1-9-3 for unirrigated land, while for irrigated land Rs. 4-12-9 is paid on cotton and double that amount on sugar-cane. Where the less valuable irrigated crops are grown, rent is paid in kind, the landlord taking one-fourth of the produce. In the D\u0101dri tahsil kind rents are very rare. From Rs. 0-12-9 to Rs. 3 per acre is paid for unirrigated land, and Rs. 4 to Rs. 5 for land watered from wells. In the Sangr\u016br tahsil rent is taken by division of crops. The rates are the same as in the Jind tahsil. The construction of railways has tended to equalize the prices of grain in different parts of the State.\n\nApart from the extension of canals, the State has since 1891 advanced Rs. 8,000 for the construction of wells for irrigation and drinking purposes, and nearly Rs. 16,000 more has been provided from village funds. There is a State bank in each tahsil, by which advances are made at half the ordinary rates of interest. The cultivated area increased by 4\u00b75 per cent. between 1881 and 1901, but there is little room for further extension.\n\nD\u0101dri, which lies close to Hari\u0101na, is the main cattle-breeding tract, the animals resembling the famous Hari\u0101na breed. Camels are also reared by the Rahb\u0101ris in this tahsil, and used both for ploughing and carrying, as well as for riding. A good type of milch buffalo is found in Jind. The State maintains three Reserves in which grazing is allowed on payment.\n\nThe State owns 7\u00b76 per cent. of the Sirhind Canal. Of the total area cultivated in 1903\u20134, 162 square miles, or more than 13 per cent., were classed as irrigated. Of this area, 37 square miles were irrigated from wells, 121 from canals, and 4 from streams. There are 2,292 masonry wells in use, besides 289 unbricked wells, lever wells, and water-lifts. Wells are virtually confined to Sangr\u016br and D\u0101dri, as the cost of making them is prohibitive in the Jind tahsil. The bucket and rope are commonly used, but a few Persian wheels are found in one part of the State. In 1903\u20134, 27 square miles were irrigated from the Sirhind Canal and 4 from the Ghaggar river and other streams in Sangr\u016br, while in the Jind tahsil the Western Jumna Canal irrigated 60 square miles. The H\u0101nsi and B\u016bt\u0101na branches of the Western Jumna Canal\nwere managed by the British Government prior to 1888. In that year, however, an agreement was made by which the State took over distribu-\ntaries irrigating 60,000 acres on payment of Rs. 1,20,000, less the cost of maintenance, &c., giving a net amount of about Rs. 1,05,500 a year payable to Government. The State is also allowed to irrigate 10,000 acres free of water rate, if there is a sufficient supply of water in the canal. The Bhiw\u0101ni branch, still under British management, irrigates about 2,300 acres in this tahsil, for which the State pays the water rates fixed for British villages, plus 50 per cent. in lieu of owner's rate.\n\nThe only forests are the three Reserves already mentioned. These are called birs and have an area of 2,623 acres. While yielding an income of over Rs. 2,000 in normal years, they also form valuable fodder reserves for the cattle in time of famine.\n\nThe State contains no mines or minerals, with the exception of stone and kankar quarries and saltpetre, the last of which yields a revenue of nearly Rs. 15,000. Stone is quarried in the D\u0101dri tahsil, but most of it is used locally.\n\nThe only industries of any importance are the manufacture of gold and silver ornaments, leathern and wood-work, cotton cloth, and rude pottery. The towns of Sangr\u016br and D\u0101dri are noted for their leathern goods, shoes, harness, and well-gear; and in the former good furniture of English pattern is made. In the Sangr\u016br tahsil embroidery is done by women for local sale and some of it is exported. There is some turnery at D\u0101dri. The only factory is a steam cotton-ginning and pressing factory at Jind town, which in 1903-4 gave employment to 120 persons.\n\nLarge quantities of grain are exported through Sangr\u016br, Jind, and D\u0101dri. Other exports are cotton, ghi, and oilseeds, while the chief imports are refined sugar and cotton cloth.\n\nThe Ludhi\u0101na-Dh\u016bri-J\u0101khal Railway was opened in 1901, the State finding four-fifths of the capital for its construction. It connects Sangr\u016br, the capital, with Dh\u016bri Junction on the R\u0101jpura-Bhatinda branch of the North-Western Railway and with J\u0101khal Junction on the Southern Punjab Railway, and is managed by the North-Western Railway in return for 55 per cent. of the gross earnings. The Southern Punjab Railway has three stations in the Jind tahsil, and the R\u0101jput\u0101na-M\u0101lw\u0101 Railway two in D\u0101dri. Sangr\u016br is also connected by metalled roads with Dh\u016bri and Pati\u0101la, and with Jind by a partially metalled road. The State contains 42 miles of metalled roads and 191 miles of unmetalled roads. The postal and telegraphic arrangements are similar to those in Pati\u0101la.\n\nIn common with the rest of the Punjab, the State suffered from the\nfamines of 1783, 1803, 1812, 1824, and 1833. That of 1860-1 also affected the State, especially the D\u0101dri tahsil, and half a year\u2019s revenue was remitted, advances for the purchase of cattle and seed being also given. In 1869-70 a fodder famine caused great losses of cattle, and a fifth of the revenue was remitted in the Jind tahsil, advances being also made in D\u0101dri. In 1877-8 the scarcity was more severe and was met by loans from the State banks. In 1883-4 a fodder famine again caused great loss of cattle, and revenue was largely suspended. In 1896 famine reappeared, and Rs. 27,500 was allotted for relief works, 7,000 maunds of grain were distributed as advances for seed, and Rs. 3,000 spent in charitable relief; and though the scarcity was intensified in 1897, the losses were not severe. In 1899 the crops failed again before the people had had time to recover from the effects of the preceding famine. Two months after the opening of relief works in October, 1899, it was resolved to concentrate the famine-stricken people on the Ludhi\u0101na-Dh\u016bri-J\u0101khal Railway. The highest daily average (1,260) was reached in March, 1900. Works were not closed until December, 1900, and the total expenditure on them exceeded Rs. 40,000. Poorhouses were also opened and relief given privately at a cost of nearly Rs. 23,000, excluding the expenditure on additional dispensaries and the relief of immigrants. On the conclusion of the famine, Rs. 1,58,000 was advanced to the people for the purchase of cattle and seed, bringing up the total expenditure incurred by the State to Rs. 2,27,000.\n\nThe Agent to the Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab for J\u012bnd is the Political Agent for the Ph\u016blk\u012b\u0101n States and Bah\u0101walpur, who resides at Pati\u0101la. The administration of the State is divided between four departments. Foreign affairs and education are controlled by the foreign minister. The Diw\u0101n controls finance, excise, and revenue; the Bakhsh\u012b Kh\u0101na under the commander-in-chief is responsible for the army and the police, and the Ad\u0101lat\u012b or minister of justice for civil and criminal justice. The heads of these departments sitting together form a State Council known as the Sadr Al\u0101, to which each of the ministers individually is subordinate. The Council again is controlled by the R\u0101j\u0101. The accountant-general\u2019s office was established in 1899. For administrative purposes the State is divided into two niz\u0101mat\u012bs and three tahs\u012bls. Each tahsil is further subdivided into police circles, the Sangr\u016br tahsil containing three, J\u012bnd and D\u0101dri two each. Each niz\u0101mat\u012b is administered by a n\u0101z\u012bm, under whom is a tahsild\u0101r in each tahsil.\n\nIn each niz\u0101mat\u012b the n\u0101z\u012bm and tahsild\u0101rs exercise judicial powers, and in 1899 a subdivisional magistrate was appointed in the D\u0101dri tahsil. The n\u0101z\u012bm corresponds roughly to a District Magistrate, and from his decisions appeals lie to the Sadr Ad\u0101lat, which is presided\nover by the Ad\u0101lat\u012b. Further appeals lie to the Sadr Al\u0101, which is subordinate to the Ijl\u0101s-i-Kh\u0101s, or court of the R\u0101j\u0101. All these courts exercise both civil and criminal jurisdiction. The Indian Penal Code and Criminal Procedure Code are in force in the State, with certain modifications.\n\nThe principal feudatory is the Sard\u0101r of Badrukh\u0101n, the representative of the junior branch of the ruling family. The j\u0101g\u012br is worth Rs. 8,843 per annum, and is subject to the usual incidents of lapse and commutation. The R\u0101j\u0101 of N\u0101bha is a member of this family.\n\nIn the time of R\u0101j\u0101 Gajpat Singh the State consisted only of the four parganas of J\u012bnd, Safidon, Sangr\u016br, and B\u0101l\u0101nw\u0101li, with a revenue of about 3 lakhs. Before the settlements made by R\u0101j\u0101 Sar\u016bp Singh, a fluctuating system of assessment was in vogue, including batai, kan-k\u016bt, and cash rates fixed on the nature of crops. The settlements were made in different years for each tahsil. Between 1857 and 1866 a summary settlement of the Sangr\u016br and J\u012bnd tahsils was conducted, resulting in a total demand of 3\u00b72 lakhs. Shortly after this a regular settlement of the whole State was made, which produced a fixed revenue of 5\u00b79 lakhs. In both of these settlements the batai system was partly continued. Two regular settlements followed, when cash rates were introduced throughout. The assessment of the fourth settlement was 6\u00b72 lakhs. Revenue rates on unirrigated land vary from a minimum of R. 0\u20134\u20131 in D\u0101dri to a maximum of Rs. 1\u201312\u201310 in Sangr\u016br, and on irrigated land from a minimum of R. 0\u20136\u20131 in D\u0101dri to a maximum of Rs. 2\u20135\u20139 in Sangr\u016br.\n\nThe collections of land revenue alone and of total revenue (including cesses) are shown below, in thousands of rupees:\n\n|                | 1880-1 | 1890-1 | 1900-1 | 1903-4 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Land revenue   | 7,14   | 7,15   | 8,03   | 7,54   |\n| Total revenue  | 10,71  | 12,67  | 14,93  | 16,04  |\n\nApart from land revenue, the principal sources of revenue, with the amounts derived from each in 1903\u20134, are as follows: canals (2\u00b75 lakhs), railways (1\u00b72 lakhs), and stamps (0\u00b76 lakh). The principal heads of expenditure are army (2\u00b77 lakhs), canals (1\u00b72 lakhs), public works (0\u00b79 lakh), police (0\u00b75 lakh), and miscellaneous (8\u00b78 lakhs).\n\nThe income derived from excise in 1903\u20134 was Rs. 29,000. Liquor is distilled on premises which belong to the State, under the supervision of State officials, and still-head duties are levied of Rs. 2\u20138\u20130 per proof gallon and Rs. 2 per gallon of 25\u00b0 under proof. The arrangement regarding the import of M\u0101lw\u0101 opium is similar to that which obtains in the case of Pati\u0101la, but the quantity allowed to J\u012bnd at the lower rate never exceeds 19 chests. The duty paid on this opium is refunded\nto the State, with the object of securing the co-operation of the officials in the suppression of smuggling. The import of opium from D\u0101dri into British territory is prohibited. The contracts for the retail sale of opium, drugs, and liquor are auctioned, and wholesale licences are granted on payment of a fixed fee. The excise arrangements are under the control of a Superintendent, who is subordinate to the Diw\u0101n.\n\nThe mint is controlled by the State treasurer, but, as in the case of Pati\u0101la, coins are struck only on special occasions, and these can hardly be said to be current coinage. The J\u012bnd rupee bears an inscription similar to that on the Pati\u0101la rupee, to the effect that it is struck under the authority of Ahmad Sh\u0101h Durr\u0101ni. (See article on Pati\u0101la.) The value of the coin is about 12 annas. Gold coins are also struck.\n\nThe towns of Sangr\u016br, J\u012bnd, Saf\u012bdon, and D\u0101dri have been constituted municipalities.\n\nThe expenditure on public works in 1903\u20134 was Rs. 90,854; and the principal buildings erected by the department since 1900 are the Ranbir College, the Ranbir Ganj, the Record Office, and the Female Hospital, all at Sangr\u016br.\n\nThe State army consists of a battalion of Imperial Service infantry, 600 strong, with all necessary transport; and a local force of 220 cavalry, 560 infantry, 80 artillery, and 16 serviceable guns.\n\nThe police force had in 1903\u20134 a total strength of 405 of all ranks, and the village watchmen numbered 523. The police force is controlled by an Inspector-General, under whom there is a Superintendent for each of the three tahs\u012bls, and a deputy-inspector for each of the seven police stations. The principal jail is at Sangr\u016br. It has accommodation for 320 prisoners, and is managed by a d\u0101raga under the supervision of the Ad\u0101lati. The chief jail industries are printing, weaving, bookbinding, and the making of daris (cotton carpets), paper, webbing, and rope.\n\nIn 1901 the proportion of literate persons was 2.8 per cent. (5 males and 0.2 females). The number of pupils under instruction was 602 in 1890\u20131, 791 in 1900\u20131, and 730 in 1903\u20134. In the last year the State had 4 secondary and 7 primary and special (public) schools, and 15 elementary (private) schools, with 3 girls in the private schools. The eleven institutions classed as public were all managed by the Educational department of the State. The existing system dates from 1889, when the old State schools at Sangr\u016br, J\u012bnd, D\u0101dri, and Saf\u012bdon were remodelled, so as to bring them into line with the regulations of the Punjab Educational department. In 1894 the school at Sangr\u016br was raised to the status of a high school, and in 1902 the Diamond Jubilee College was completed at that town. The expenditure of\nthe State on education was Rs. 9,300 in 1892\u20133 and Rs. 10,400 in 1903\u20134.\n\nThe State contains 3 hospitals and 6 dispensaries, with accommodation for 64 in-patients. In 1903\u20134 the number of cases treated was 29,129, of whom 166 were in-patients, and 867 operations were performed. The expenditure was Rs. 17,815. The medical department is in charge of the State Medical officer.\n\nVaccination, which is compulsory throughout the State, is carried out by a staff of four vaccinators under an inspector. In 1903\u20134 the number of vaccinations performed was 4,752, representing 16.9 per 1,000 of the population.\n\nRevenue survey maps were prepared for each tahsil at the first settlement. They were revised during the second and third settlements, and during the fourth settlement a fresh survey of Jind and Sangrur was made and new maps were prepared. For the Jind tahsil, a map on the 4-inch scale was made. The first trigonometrical survey was made between 1847 and 1849, and maps were published on the 1-inch and 2-inch scales. A 4-inch map of the Cis-Sutlej States was published in 1863, and a revised edition of it in 1897. The 1-inch maps prepared in 1847\u20139 were revised in 1886\u201392.\n\n[H. A. Rose, Phulkian States Gazetteer (in the press); L. H. Griffin, The Rajas of the Punjab (second edition, 1873).]\n\nJind Nizamat.\u2014South-eastern nizamat or administrative district of Jind State, Punjab, lying between 28\u00b0 24\u2032 and 29\u00b0 28\u2032 N. and 75\u00b0 55\u2032 and 76\u00b0 48\u2032 E., with an area of 1,080 square miles. It comprises the two tahsils of Jind and Dadri. The population in 1901 was 217,322, compared with 225,039 in 1891. The nizamat contains five towns, Jind, the head-quarters, Safidon, Dadri, Kaliana, and Braund; and 344 villages. The land revenue and cesses in 1903\u20134 amounted to 4.7 lakhs.\n\nJind Tahsil.\u2014Northern tahsil of the Jind State and nizamat, Punjab, lying between 29\u00b0 2\u2032 and 29\u00b0 28\u2032 N. and 76\u00b0 15\u2032 and 76\u00b0 48\u2032 E., with an area of 489 square miles. It forms a compact triangle, almost entirely surrounded by the British Districts of Karnal, Delhi, Rohtak, and Hissar, while on the north it is bounded by the Narwana tahsil of Patiala. It lies entirely in the natural tract known as the Bangar, and includes a part of the Nardak or Kurukshetra, the sacred land of the Hindus. The population in 1901 was 124,954, compared with 123,898 in 1891. The tahsil contains two towns, Jind (population, 8,047), the head-quarters, and Safidon (4,832); and 163 villages. The land revenue and cesses in 1903\u20134 amounted to 2.3 lakhs.\n\nJind Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the Jind nizamat and tahsil, Jind State, Punjab, situated in 29\u00b0 20\u2032 N. and 76\u00b0 19\u2032 E., on the Southern\nPunjab Railway, 60 miles south-east of Sangr\u016br, the modern capital, and 25 miles north-west of Rohtak. Population (1901), 8,047. It was formerly the capital of the State to which it gave its name, and the R\u0101j\u0101s of Jind are still installed here. It lies in the holy tract of Kurukshetra; and tradition ascribes its foundation to the P\u0101ndavas, who built a temple here to Jainti Dev\u012b, the \u2018goddess of victory,\u2019 round which sprang up the town Jaintapuri, since corrupted into Jind. Of little importance in the Muhammadan period, it was seized by Gajpat Singh, the first R\u0101j\u0101 of Jind, in 1755. Rah\u012bm D\u0101d Kh\u0101n was sent by the Delhi government in 1775 to recover it, but was defeated and killed. His tomb is still to be seen at the Safidon Gate, and trophies of the victory are preserved in the town. It contains many ancient temples, and several places of pilgrimage. The fort of Fatehgarh, part of which is now used as a jail, was built by R\u0101j\u0101 Gajpat Singh. The municipality has an income of Rs. 7,210, chiefly from octroi; and there is a considerable local trade.\n\nJinjir\u0101m.\u2014River of Assam, which rises in the Urpad l\u012bl, Go\u0101lp\u0101ra District, and flows through the southern portion of that District till it falls into the Brahmaputra, south of M\u0101nikarchar, after a course of 120 miles. The most important places on its banks are Lakhipur, South S\u0101lm\u0101ra, and Singim\u0101ri. Above S\u0101lm\u0101ra the country is under water during the rains, and boats of 4 tons burden can proceed as far as Lakhipur. In the dry season they cannot get above Singim\u0101ri. The river serves as a trade route for the southern portion of Go\u0101lp\u0101ra and the G\u0101ro Hills.\n\nJint\u016br.\u2014Northern t\u0101luk of Parbhani District, Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State, with an area of 952 square miles. Including j\u0101g\u012brs, the population in 1901 was 87,797, compared with 123,546 in 1891, the decrease being due to the famine of 1900. The t\u0101luk contains 297 villages, of which 37 are j\u0101g\u012br, and Jint\u016br (population, 3,688) is the head-quarters. The land revenue in 1901 was 3\u00b72 lakhs. The t\u0101luk lies between the rivers P\u016brna (north) and Dudna (south). The soils are mainly alluvial and regar.\n\nJiral K\u0101msoli.\u2014Petty State in Rew\u0101 K\u0101nth\u0101, Bombay.\n\nJirang.\u2014Petty State in the Kh\u0101si Hills, Eastern Bengal and Assam. The population in 1901 was 723, and the gross revenue in 1903\u20134 Rs. 2,245. The principal products are rice, millet, ginger, caoutchouc, and cotton.\n\nJiri.\u2014River of Assam, which rises on the southern slopes of the Barail, and, after a southerly course of 75 miles, falls into the Bar\u0101k or Surm\u0101. For nearly the whole of its length it forms the boundary between C\u0101ch\u0101r District and the State of Manipur, and it is crossed at Jirigh\u0101t by a ferry, which is maintained for the use of travellers along the Silchar-Manipur road. The greater part of its course lies through\nhilly country, and there is very little cultivated land in the vicinity. The only traffic brought down by the river consists of forest produce and tea from a garden situated at Jirigh\u00e2t, about 5 miles above its confluence with the Bar\u0101k.\n\n**Jobat.**\u2014A guaranteed chiefship in Central India, under the Bh\u014dp\u0101war Agency, lying between $22^\\circ 21'$ and $22^\\circ 30'$ N. and $74^\\circ 28'$ and $74^\\circ 50'$ E., with an area of about 140 square miles. It is bounded on the north by the Jh\u0101bua State; on the south and west by Al\u012b-\u012arajpur; and on the east by Gwalior. Jobat lies entirely in the hilly tract of the Vindhyas, and is intersected by a succession of short ranges and narrow valleys covered with thick jungle. The geological formations met with are of unusual interest. In the immediate neighbourhood of the town of Jobat, and covering a considerable area round it, is an outcrop of a peculiar jaspideous, ferruginous rock, while the greater part of the State is occupied by gneissose and schistose rocks. Along the northern border the Lametas are represented by the Nim\u0101r sandstone and B\u0101gh limestones, overlaid by trap. The annual rainfall averages about 30 inches.\n\nThere is some uncertainty as to the founder of this State; but the best-supported account relates that the territory passed to Kesar Deo, great-grandson of Anand Deo, the founder of Al\u012b-\u012arajpur, in the fifteenth century. On the establishment of British supremacy, R\u0101n\u0101 Sabal Singh was in possession, and was succeeded by R\u0101n\u0101 Ranj\u012bt Singh, who died in 1874. Ranj\u012bt Singh in 1864 agreed to cede all land which might at any time be required for railways through his State. He was followed by Sar\u016bp Singh, who died in 1897, and was succeeded by the present chief, Indrajit Singh, who is still a minor, and is being educated at the Daly College at Indore. The title of R\u0101n\u0101 is borne by the rulers of Jobat.\n\nPopulation has been: (1881) 9,387, (1891) 15,047, and (1901) 9,443, giving a density of 67 persons per square mile. The decrease of 37 per cent. during the last decade is due mainly to the famine of 1899-1900. Animists (chiefly Bhils and Bhil\u0101las) number 8,131, or 86 per cent. of the total.\n\nThe general fertility of the soil is low, and the Bhils, who form the greater part of the population, are indifferent agriculturists. The total area is thus distributed: cultivated, 32 square miles, of which only 62 acres can be irrigated; cultivable but not under cultivation, 30 square miles; waste and forest land, 78 square miles. Of the cropped area, *urd* occupies 17 square miles, or 53 per cent.; maize, 10 square miles; and *jow\u0101r*, 7 square miles.\n\nThe forest area, which covers almost the whole of the uncultivable portion of the State, has since 1902 been in charge of the Agency Forest officer. Asbestos has been found in some quantity, but the\nquality is poor, and an attempt to work it proved a failure. Trade generally has increased, especially the export of grain, which is carried to Dohad on the Godhra-Ujjain section of the Bombay, Baroda, and Central India Railway by a fair-weather road, 40 miles in length. A British post office has been opened at Ghora village; the nearest telegraph office is at B\u0101gh in the Amjhera district of Gwalior, 15 miles distant.\n\nThe State is divided into five th\u0101nas\u2014Jobat, Guda, Hir\u0101pur, Thapli, and Ju\u0101ri\u2014under two th\u0101nad\u0101rs, who are the revenue collectors. Owing to the chief's minority, the State is at present administered by the Political Agent, through a Superintendent, all matters of importance being dealt with by him. The total revenue is Rs. 21,000, of which Rs. 8,300 is derived from land, Rs. 2,700 from forests, and Rs. 4,000 from excise. The general administration, including the chief's establishment, costs Rs. 15,000 a year. The incidence of the land revenue demand is 9 annas per acre of cultivated land and 2 annas per acre of total area. The jail is at Jobat, and a vernacular school is maintained at Ghora. In 1901 only one per cent. of the population (almost all males) could read and write.\n\nJobat village, containing the residence of the chief, is situated in 22\u00b0 27' N. and 74\u00b0 37' E. Population (1901), 208. It is reached from the Dohad or Meghnagar stations on the Ratl\u0101m-Godhra section of the Bombay, Baroda, and Central India Railway, the stations being 40 miles distant by fair-weather road from the village. The administrative head-quarters, however, are at Ghora, 2 miles south of Jobat. Population (1901), 1,154. The State is often called Ghora-Jobat by natives, on account of its two capitals.\n\n**Jodhpur State** (also called M\u0101rw\u0101r).\u2014The largest State in R\u0101jput\u0101na, having an area of 34,963 square miles, or more than one-fourth of the total area of the Agency. It lies between 24\u00b0 37' and 27\u00b0 42' N. and 70\u00b0 6' and 75\u00b0 22' E. It is bounded on the north by Bikaner; on the north-west by Jaisalmer; on the west by Sind; on the south-west by the Rann of Cutch; on the south by P\u0101lanpur and Sirohi; on the south-east by Udaipur; on the east by Ajmer-Merw\u0101ra and Kishangarh; and on the north-east by Jaipur. The country, as its name M\u0101rw\u0101r (= 'region of death') implies, is sterile, sandy, and inhospitable. There are some comparatively fertile lands in the north-east, east, and south-east in the neighbourhood of the Ar\u0101valli Hills; but, generally speaking, it is a dreary waste covered with sandhills, rising sometimes to a height of 300 or 400 feet, and the desolation becomes more absolute and marked as one proceeds westwards. The northern and north-western portion is a mere desert, known as the *thal*, in which, it has been said, there are more spears than spear-grass heads,\nand blades of steel grow better than blades of corn. The country here resembles an undulating sea of sand; an occasional oasis is met with, but water is exceedingly scarce and often 200 to 300 feet below the surface. The Ar\u0101valli Hills form the entire eastern boundary of the State, the highest peak within Jodhpur limits being in the south-east (3,607 feet above the sea). Several small offshoots of the Ar\u0101vallis lie in the south, notably the S\u016bnda hills (Jaswantpura), where a height of 3,252 feet is attained, the Chappan-k\u0101-pah\u0101r near Siw\u0101na (3,199 feet), and the Roja hills at J\u0101lor (2,408 feet). Scattered over the State are numerous isolated hills, varying in height from 1,000 to 2,000 feet. The only important river is the L\u016bni. Its chief tributaries are the L\u012blri, the Raipur L\u016bni, the Guhiya, the B\u0101ndi, the Sukri, and the Jawai on the left bank, and the Jojri on the right. The principal lake is the famous salt lake at S\u0101m\u0113har. Two other depressions of the same kind exist at D\u012bdw\u0101na and Pachbhadra. There are a few jhils or marshes, notably one near Bhatki in the south-west, which covers an area of 40 or 50 square miles in the rainy season, and the bed of which, when dry, yields good crops of wheat and gram.\n\nA large part of the State is covered by sand-dunes of the transverse type, that is, with their longer axes at right angles to the prevailing wind. Isolated hills of solid rock are scattered over the plain. The oldest rocks found are schists of the Ar\u0101valli system, and upon them rests unconformably a great series of ancient subaerial rhyolites with subordinate bands of conglomerate, the Mall\u0101ni series. These cover a large area in the west and extend to the capital. Coarse-grained granites of two varieties, one containing no mica and the other both hornblende and mica, are associated with the rhyolites. Near the capital, sandstones of Vindhyan age rest unconformably upon the rhyolites. Some beds of conglomerate, showing traces of glacial action, have been found at Pokaran and are referred to the T\u0101lcher period. Sandstones and conglomerates with traces of fossil leaves occur at B\u0101rmer, and are probably of Jurassic age. The famous marble quarries of Makr\u0101na are situated in Jodhpur territory, the marble being found among the crystalline Ar\u0101valli schists.\n\nThe eastern and some of the southern districts are well wooded with natural forests, the most important indigenous timber-tree being the babul (Acacia arabica), the leaves and pods of which are used as fodder in the hot season, while the bark is a valuable tanning and dyeing agent. Among other trees may be mentioned the mahu\u0101 (Bassia latifolia), valuable for its timber and flowers; the amval (Cassia auriculata), the bark of which is largely used in tanning; the dh\u0101k or palis (Butea frondosa), the dha\u014d (Anogeissus pendula), the g\u016blar (Ficus glomerata), the siris (Albizia Lebbek), and the khair (Acacia Catechu). Throughout the plains the kheira (Prosopis spicigera), the rohira (Tecoma\nundulata), and the nim (Melia Azadirachta) are common, and the tamarind and the bar (Ficus bengalensis) are fairly so. The pipal (Ficus religiosa), a sacred tree, is found in almost every village. The principal fruit trees are the pomegranate (Punica Granatum), the Jodhpur variety of which is celebrated for its delicate flavour, and the nimbu or lime-tree. In the desert the chief trees are two species of the ber (Zizyphus Jujuba and Z. nummularia), which flourish even in years of scanty rainfall, and furnish the main fodder and fruit-supply of this part of the country; and the khejra, which is not less important, as its leaves and shoots provide the inhabitants with vegetables (besides being eaten by camels, goats, and cattle), its pods are consumed as fruits, its wood is used for roofs, carts, and agricultural implements or as fuel, and its fresh bark is, in years of famine, stripped off and ground with grain to give the meagre meal a more substantial bulk.\n\nThe fauna is varied. Lions are now extinct, the last four having been shot near Jaswantpura about 1872, and the wild ass (Equus hemionus) is seldom, if ever, seen. Tiger, sambhar (Cervus unicolor), and black bears are found in the Aravallis and the Jaswantpura and Jalor hills, but in yearly decreasing numbers. Wild hog are fairly numerous in the same localities, but are scarcer than they used to be in the low hills adjacent to the capital. Leopards and hyenas are generally plentiful, and nilgai (Boselaphus tragocamelus) are found in some of the northern and eastern districts. Indian gazelle abound in the plains, as also do antelope, save in the actual desert; but the chital (Cervus axis) is seen only on the slopes of the Aravallis in the south-east. Wolves are numerous in the west, and wild dogs are occasionally met with in the forests. In addition to the usual small game, there are several species of sand-grouse (including the imperial), and two of bustard, namely, the great Indian (Eupodotis edwardsi) and the houbara (Houbara macqueenii).\n\nThe climate is dry, even in the monsoon period, and characterized by extreme variations of temperature during the cold season. The hot months are fairly healthy, but the heat is intense; scorching winds prevail with great violence in April, May, and June, and sand-storms are of frequent occurrence. The climate is often pleasant towards the end of July and in August and September; but a second hot season is not uncommon in October and the first half of November. In the cold season (November 15 to about March 15) the mean daily range is sometimes as much as 30\u00b0, and malarial and other fevers prevail. An observatory was opened at Jodhpur city in October, 1896, and the average daily mean temperature for the nine years ending 1905 has been nearly 81\u00b0 (varying from 62.7\u00b0 in January to 94.2\u00b0 in May). The mean daily range is about 25\u00b0 (16.6\u00b0 in August and 30.5\u00b0 in November). The highest temperature recorded since the observatory\nwas established has been $121^\\circ$ on June 10, 1897, and the lowest $28^\\circ$ on January 29, 1905.\n\nThe country is situated outside the regular course of both the southwest and north-east monsoons, and the rainfall is consequently scanty and irregular. Moreover, even in ordinary years, it varies considerably in different districts, and is so erratic and fitful that it is a common saying among the village folk that 'sometimes only one horn of the cow lies within the rainy zone and the other without.' The annual rainfall for the whole State averages about 13 inches, nearly all received in July, August, and September. The fall varies from less than 7 inches at Sheo in the west to about 13 inches at the capital, and nearly $18\\frac{1}{2}$ inches at Jaswantpura (in the south) and B\u0101li in the southeast. The heaviest fall recorded in any one year was over $55\\frac{1}{2}$ inches at S\u0101nchor (in the south-west) in 1893, whereas in 1899 two of the western districts (Sheo and S\u0101nkra) received but 0.14 inch each.\n\nThe Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101 of Jodhpur is the head of the R\u0101thor clan of R\u0101jputs, and claims descent from R\u0101ma, the deified king of Ajodhv\u0101. The original name of the clan was R\u0101shtra ('protector'), and subsequently eulogistic suffixes and prefixes were attached, such as R\u0101shtrak\u016bta (k\u016bta = 'highest') or Mah\u0101r\u0101shtra (mah\u0101 = 'great'), &c. The clan is mentioned in some of Asoka's edicts as rulers of the Deccan, but their earliest known king is Abhimanyu of the fifth or sixth century A.D., from which time onward their history is increasingly clear. For nearly four centuries preceding A.D. 973 the R\u0101shtrak\u016btas gave nineteen kings to the Deccan; but in the year last mentioned they were driven out by the Ch\u0101lukyas (Solanki R\u0101jputs) and sought shelter in Kanauj, where a branch of their family is said to have formed a settlement early in the ninth century. Here, after living in comparative obscurity for about twenty-five years, they dispossessed their protecting kinsmen and founded a new dynasty known by the name of Gaharw\u0101r. There were seven kings of this dynasty (though the first two are said to have never actually ruled over Kanauj), and the last was Jai Chand, who in 1194 was defeated by Muhammad Ghori, and, while attempting to escape, was drowned in the Ganges. The nearer kinsmen of Jai Chand, unwilling to submit to the conqueror, sought in the scrub and desert of R\u0101jput\u0101na a second line of defence against the advancing wave of Muhammadan conquest. Si\u0101hji, the grandson (or, according to some, the nephew) of Jai Chand, with about 200 followers, 'the wreck of his vassalage,' accomplished the pilgrimage to Dw\u0101rka, and is next found conquering Kher (in Mallani) and the neighbouring tract from the Gohel R\u0101jputs, and planting the standard of the R\u0101thors amidst the sandhills of the L\u016bni in 1212. About the same time a community of Br\u0101hmans held the city and extensive lands of P\u0101li, and, being greatly harassed by Mers,\nBhils, and M\u012bn\u0101s, invoked the aid of Si\u0101hj\u012b in dispersing them. This he readily accomplished; and, when subsequently invited to settle in the place as its protector, celebrated the next Holi festival by putting to death the leading men, and in this way adding the district to his conquests. The foundation of the State now called Jodhpur thus dates from about 1212; but this was not the first appearance of the R\u0101thors in M\u0101rw\u0101r, for, as the article on B\u0101li shows, five of this clan ruled at Hath\u016bndi in the south-east in the tenth century. In Si\u0101hj\u012b's time, however, the greater part of the country was held by Parih\u0101r, Gohel, Chauh\u0101n, or Param\u0101ra R\u0101jputs. The nine immediate successors of Si\u0101hj\u012b were engaged in perpetual broils with the people among whom they had settled, and in 1381 the tenth, Rao Chonda, accomplished what they had been unable to do. He took Mandor from the Parih\u0101r chief, and made his possession secure by marrying the latter's daughter. This place was the R\u0101thor capital for the next seventy-eight years, and formed a convenient base for adventures farther afield, which resulted in the annexation of N\u0101gaur and other places before the Rao's death about 1409. His son and successor, Ran Mal, who was a brother-in-law of R\u0101n\u0101 L\u0101kh\u0101, appears to have spent most of his time at Chitor, where he interfered in Mew\u0101r politics and was assassinated in an attempt to usurp the throne of the infant R\u0101n\u0101 Kumbha. The next chief was Rao Jodha, who, after annexing Sojat in 1455, laid the foundation of Jodhpur city in 1459 and transferred thither the seat of government. He had fourteen (or, according to some authorities, seventeen) sons, of whom the eldest, S\u0101tal, succeeded him about 1488, but was killed three years later in a battle with the S\u016bbahd\u0101r of Ajmer, while the sixth was Bika, the founder of the Bikaner State. S\u0101tal was followed by his brother S\u016bja, remembered as the 'cavalier prince,' who in 1516 met his death in a fight with the Path\u0101ns at the Pip\u0101r fair while rescuing 140 R\u0101thor maidens who were being carried off. Rao Ganga (1516\u201332) sent his clansmen to fight under the standard of Mew\u0101r against the Mughal emperor, B\u0101bar, and on the fatal field of Kh\u0101nua (1527) his grandson Rai Mal and several other R\u0101thors of note were slain.\n\nRao M\u0101ldeo (1532\u201369) was styled by Firishta 'the most powerful prince in Hindust\u0101n'; he conquered and annexed numerous districts and strongholds, and, in his time, M\u0101rw\u0101r undoubtedly reached its zenith of power, territory, and independence. When the emperor Hum\u0101y\u016bn was driven from the throne by Sher Sh\u0101h, he sought in vain the protection of M\u0101ldeo; but the latter derived no advantage from this inhospitality, for Sher Sh\u0101h in 1544 led an army of 80,000 men against him. In the engagements that ensued the Afgh\u0101n was very nearly beaten, and his position was becoming daily more critical, till at last he had recourse to a stratagem which secured for him so narrow\nand barren a victory that he was forced to declare that he had \u2018nearly lost the empire of India for a handful of bajra\u2019\u2014an allusion to the poverty of the soil of M\u0101rw\u0101r as unfitted to produce richer grain. Subsequently Akbar invaded the country and, after an obstinate and sanguinary defence, captured the forts of Merta and N\u0101gaur. To appease him, Maldeo sent his second son to him with gifts; but the emperor was so dissatisfied with the disdainful bearing of the desert chief, who refused personally to attend his court, that he besieged Jodhpur, forced the Rao to pay homage in the person of his eldest son, Udai Singh, and even presented to the Bikaner chief, a scion of the Jodhpur house, a formal grant for the State of Jodhpur together with the leadership of the clan. Rao M\u0101ldeo died shortly afterwards; and then commenced a civil strife between his two sons, Udai Singh and Chandra Sen, ending in favour of the latter, who, though the younger, was the choice of both his father and the nobles. He, however, ruled for only a few years, and was succeeded (about 1581) by his brother, who, by giving his sister, Jodh Bai, in marriage to Akbar, and his daughter M\u0101n Bai to the prince Sal\u012bm (Jah\u0101ng\u012br), recovered all the former possessions of his house, except Ajmer, and obtained several rich districts in M\u0101lw\u0101 and the title of R\u0101j\u0101. The next two chiefs, S\u016br Singh (1595\u20131620) and Gaj Singh (1620\u201338), served with great distinction in several battles in Gujar\u0101t and the Deccan. The brilliant exploits of the former gained for him the title of Sawai R\u0101j\u0101, while the latter, besides being viceroy of the Deccan, was styled Dalbhanjan (or \u2018destroyer of the army\u2019) and Dalthambhan (or \u2018leader of the host\u2019).\n\nJaswant Singh (1638\u201378) was the first ruler of M\u0101rw\u0101r to receive the title of Mah\u0101raj\u0101. His career was a remarkable one. In 1658 he was appointed viceroy of M\u0101lw\u0101, and received the command of the army dispatched against Aurangzeb and Mur\u0101d, who were then in rebellion against their father. Being over-confident of victory and anxious to triumph over two princes in one day, he delayed his attack until they had joined forces, and in the end suffered a severe defeat at Fateh\u0101b\u0101d near Ujjain. Aurangzeb subsequently sent assurances of pardon to Jaswant Singh, and summoned him to join the army then being collected against Shuj\u0101. The summons was obeyed, but as soon as the battle commenced he wheeled about, cut to pieces Aurangzeb\u2019s rearguard, plundered his camp, and marched with the spoils to Jodhpur. Later on he served as viceroy of Gujar\u0101t and the Deccan, and finally in 1678, in order to get rid of him, Aurangzeb appointed him to lead an army against the Afgh\u0101ns. He died in the same year at Jamrud, and was succeeded by his posthumous son, Ajit Singh, during whose infancy Aurangzeb invaded M\u0101rw\u0101r, sacked Jodhpur and all the large towns, destroyed the temples and commanded the conversion of the R\u0101thor race to Isl\u0101m. This cruel policy cemented into one bond of union all\nwho cherished either patriotism or religion, and in the wars that ensued\nthe emperor gained little of either honour or advantage. On Aurang-\nzeb's death in 1707 Ajit Singh proceeded to Jodhpur, slaughtered or\ndispersed the imperial garrison, and recovered his capital. In the fol-\nlowing year he became a party to the triple alliance with Udaipur and\nJaipur to throw off the Muhammadan yoke. One of the conditions of\nthis alliance was that the chiefs of Jodhpur and Jaipur should regain the\nprivilege of marrying with the Udaipur family, which they had forfeited\nby contracting matrimonial alliances with the Mughal emperors, on the\nunderstanding that the offspring of Udaipur princesses should suc-\nceed to the State in preference to all other children. The allies fought\na successful battle at Sambhar in 1709, and a year or so later forced\nBahadur Shah to make peace.\n\nWhen the Saiyid brothers\u2014\"the Warwicks of the East\"\u2014were in\npower, they called upon Ajit Singh to mark his subservience to the\nDelhi court in the customary manner by sending a contingent headed\nby his heir to serve. This he declined to do, so his capital was in-\nvested, his eldest son (Abhai Singh) was taken to Delhi as a hostage,\nand he was compelled, among other things, to give his daughter in mar-\nriage to Farrukhsiyar and himself repair to the imperial court. For\na few years Ajit Singh was mixed up in all the intrigues that occurred;\nbut on the murder of Farrukhsiyar in 1719, he refused his sanction to\nthe nefarious schemes of the Saiyids, and in 1720 returned to his\ncapital, leaving Abhai Singh behind. In 1721 Ajit Singh seized Ajmer,\nwhere he coined money in his own name, but had to surrender the place\nto Muhammad Shah two years later. In the meantime, Abhai Singh\nhad been persuaded that the only mode of arresting the ruin of the\nJodhpur State and of hastening his own elevation was the murder of his\nfather; and in 1724 he induced his brother, Bakht Singh, to commit this\nfoul crime. Abhai Singh ruled for about twenty-six years, and in 1731\nrendered great service to Muhammad Shah by capturing Ahmadabad\nand suppressing the rebellion of Sarbuland Khan.\n\nOn his death in 1750 his son Ram Singh succeeded, but was soon\nousted by his uncle, Bakht Singh, the parricide, and forced to flee to\nUjjain, where he found Jai Appa Sindhia and concerted measures for\nthe invasion of his country. In the meantime Bakht Singh had met his\ndeath, by means, it is said, of a poisoned robe given him by his aunt or\nniece, the wife of the Jaipur chief; and his son, Bijai Singh, was ruling\nat Jodhpur. The Marathas assisted Ram Singh to gain a victory over\nhis cousin at Merta about 1756; but they shortly afterwards abandoned\nhim, and wrested from Bijai Singh the fort and district of Ajmer and the\npromise of a fixed triennial tribute. After this, Marwar enjoyed several\nyears of peace, until the rapid strides made by the Marathas towards\nuniversal rapine, if not conquest, compelled the principal Rajput States\n(Mew\u0101r, Jodhpur, and Jaipur) once more to form a union for the defence of their political existence. In the battle of Tonga (1787) Sindhia was routed, and compelled to abandon not only the field but all his conquests (including Ajmer) for a time. He soon returned, however; and in 1790 his army under De Boigne defeated the R\u0101jputs in the murderous engagements at P\u0101tan (in June) and Merta (in September). In the result, he imposed on Jodhpur a fine of 60 lakhs, and recovered Ajmer, which was thus lost for ever to the R\u0101thors. Bijai Singh died about 1793, and was succeeded by his grandson, Bh\u012bm Singh, who ruled for ten years.\n\nAt the commencement of the Mar\u0101th\u0101 War in 1803 M\u0101n Singh was chief of Jodhpur, and negotiated first with the British and subsequently with Holkar. Troubles then came quickly upon Jodhpur, owing to internal disputes regarding the succession of Dhonkal Singh, a supposed posthumous son of Bh\u012bm Singh, and a disastrous war with Jaipur for the hand of the daughter of the Mah\u0101r\u0101n\u0101 of Udaipur. The freebooter Am\u012br Kh\u0101n espoused first the cause of Jaipur and then that of Jodhpur, terrified M\u0101n Singh into abdication and pretended insanity, assumed the management of the State itself for two years, and ended by plundering the treasury and leaving the country with its resources completely exhausted. On Am\u012br Kh\u0101n's withdrawal in 1817, Chhatar Singh, the only son of M\u0101n Singh, assumed the regency, and with him the British Government commenced negotiations at the outbreak of the Pind\u0101ri War. A treaty was concluded in January, 1818, by which the State was taken under protection and agreed (1) to pay an annual tribute of Rs. 1,08,000 (reduced in 1847 to Rs. 98,000, in consideration of the cession of the fort and district of Umarkot), and (2) to furnish, when required, a contingent of 1,500 horse (an obligation converted in 1835 to an annual payment of Rs. 1,15,000\u2014see the article on Erinpura). Chhatar Singh died shortly after the conclusion of the treaty, whereupon his father, M\u0101n Singh, threw off the mask of insanity and resumed the administration. Within a few months he put to death or imprisoned most of the nobles who, during his assumed imbecility, had shown any unfriendly feeling towards him; and many of the others fled from his tyranny and appealed for aid to the British, with the result that in 1824 the Mahar\u0101j\u0101 was obliged to restore the confiscated estates of some of them. In 1827 the nobles again rebelled, and putting the pretender, Dhonkal Singh, at their head, prepared to invade Jodhpur from Jaipur territory. Lastly, in 1839, the misgovernment of M\u0101n Singh and the consequent disaffection and insurrection in the State reached such a pitch that the British Government was compelled to interfere. A force was marched to Jodhpur, of which it held military occupation for five months, when M\u0101n Singh executed an engagement to ensure future good government. He died in 1843, leaving no son; and by the choice\nof his widows and the nobles and officials of the State, confirmed by Government, Takht Singh, chief of Ahmadnagar, became Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101 of Jodhpur, the claims revived by Dhonkal Singh being set aside. The Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101 did good service during the Mutiny, but the affairs of M\u0101rw\u0101r fell into the utmost confusion owing to his misrule, and the Government of India had to interfere in 1868. In 1870 he leased to Government the Jodhpur share of the Sambhar Lake, together with the salt marts of N\u0101wa and G\u016bdha. Takht Singh died in 1873, when he was succeeded by his eldest son, Jaswant Singh. The new administration was distinguished by the vigour and success with which dacoities and crimes of violence (formerly very numerous) were suppressed, by pushing on the construction of railways and irrigation works, improving the customs tariff, introducing a regular revenue settlement, &c. In fact, in every department a wise and progressive policy was pursued. No chief could have better upheld the character of his house for unswerving loyalty to Government, and the two fine regiments of Imperial Service cavalry raised by him are among the evidences of this honourable feeling. He was created a G.C.S.I. in 1875, and subsequently his salute (ordinarily 17 guns) was raised first to 19, and next to 21 guns. He died in 1895, leaving a strong and sound administration to his only son, Sard\u0101r Singh, who was born in 1880, and is the present Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101. He was invested with powers in 1898, the administration during his minority having been carried on by his uncle, Mah\u0101r\u0101j Pr\u0101tap Singh (now the Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101 of Idar), assisted by a Council. The chief events of His Highness's rule have been: the employment of a regiment of his Imperial Service Lancers on the north-west frontier in 1897\u20138 and in China in 1900\u20131; the extension of the railway to the Sind border and thence to Hyderabad; the great famine of 1899\u20131900; the conversion of the local into British currency in 1900; and his visit to Europe in 1901. Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101 Sard\u0101r Singh was a member of the Imperial Cadet Corps from January, 1902, to August, 1903.\n\nThe State is rich in antiquarian remains; the most interesting are described in the articles on B\u0101l\u012b, Bh\u012bnm\u0101l, D\u012bdw\u0101na, J\u0101lor, Mandor, N\u0101dol, N\u0101gaur, P\u0101l\u012b, R\u0101napur, and S\u0101dri.\n\nExcluding the 21 villages situated in the British District of Merw\u0101ra, which, under an arrangement made in 1885, are administered by the Government of India, but over which the Jodhpur Darb\u0101r still retains other rights, there were, in 1901,\n\nPopulation.\n\n4,057 towns and villages in the State, the town of Sambhar being under the joint jurisdiction of the Jodhpur and Jaipur Darb\u0101rs. The population at each of the three enumerations was: (1881) 1,757,681, (1891) 2,528,178, and (1901) 1,935,565. The territory in 1901 was divided into 24 districts or huk\u016bmats (since reduced to 23), and contained one city, JODHPUR (population, 79,109), the capital of the State and a munici-\npality, and 26 towns. The principal towns are Phalodi (population, 13,924) and N\u0101gaur (13,377) in the north, P\u0101li (12,673) and Sojat (11,107) in the east, and Kuch\u0101wan (10,749) in the north-east. The following table gives the chief statistics of population in 1901:\n\n| Huk\u016bmat | Area in square miles | Number of Towns | Villages | Population | Percentage of variation in population between 1891 and 1901 | Number of persons able to read and write |\n|---------|----------------------|----------------|----------|------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Jodhpur | 2,896                | 2              | 370      | 235,461    | -28.1                                           | 17,372                                |\n| B\u0101li { Godw\u0101r } | 837 | 1 | 160 | 96,194 | -22.8 | 3,777 |\n| Desuri | 706 | 1 | 160 | 67,764 | -22.8 | 3,686 |\n| Bil\u0101ra | 792 | 2 | 88 | 57,794 | -32 | 4,196 |\n| Didw\u0101na | 1,136 | 1 | 113 | 44,642 | -17.8 | 2,285 |\n| Jait\u0101ran | 959 | 2 | 116 | 67,733 | -22.7 | 2,683 |\n| Jalor | 1,552 | 1 | 252 | 140,880 | -17.3 | 9,887 |\n| Jaswantpura | 1,360 | 1 | 198 | 83,370 | -25.3 | 5,179 |\n| Mall\u0101ni | 5,750 | 1 | 464 | 172,330 | -22.1 | 5,018 |\n| M\u0101rot | 498 | ... | 109 | 54,873 | -3.4 | 1,602 |\n| Merta | 1,618 | 1 | 370 | 142,854 | -30.6 | 8,040 |\n| N\u0101gaur | 2,608 | 4 | 420 | 167,759 | -33.5 | 9,096 |\n| N\u0101wa * | 302 | 2 | 12 | 24,960 | -20.9 | 1,930 |\n| Pachbhadra | 854 | 2 | 105 | 39,427 | -25.5 | 2,118 |\n| P\u0101li | 1,024 | 1 | 80 | 43,889 | -42.9 | 2,787 |\n| Parbatsar | 840 | ... | 165 | 87,127 | -17 | 2,418 |\n| Phalodi | 2,624 | 2 | 71 | 59,619 | -17 | 5,130 |\n| S\u0101mbhar | 160 | 1 | 6 | 7,438 | -10.5 | 571 |\n| S\u0101nch\u014dr | 1,776 | ... | 231 | 70,401 | -26.6 | 1,668 |\n| S\u0101nkra | 1,279 | 1 | 71 | 25,960 | +157.7 | 1,009 |\n| Sheo | 2,004 | ... | 65 | 24,405 | -19.4 | 459 |\n| Shergarh | 1,456 | ... | 80 | 56,921 | -19.7 | 2,035 |\n| Siw\u0101na | 760 | ... | 112 | 53,931 | -16.7 | 2,210 |\n| Sojat | 1,172 | 1 | 212 | 109,833 | -22.5 | 9,685 |\n\nState total | 34,963 | 27 | 4,930 | 1,935,565 | -23.4 | 104,841 |\n\n* Amalgamated with S\u0101mbhar in 1902-3.\n\nThe large decrease in the population since 1891 was due to a series of bad seasons culminating in the great famine of 1899-1900, and also to heavy mortality from cholera and fever at the end of the decade. The enormous increase in the population of the S\u0101nkra district is ascribed mainly to the immigration of Bh\u0101ti R\u0101jputs and others from Jaisalmer, while the small decreases in the M\u0101rot and S\u0101mbhar districts (both in the north-east) seem to show that the famine was less severely felt there. Of the total population, 1,606,046, or nearly 83 per cent., are Hindus; 149,419, or nearly 8 per cent., Musalm\u0101ns; 137,393, or 7 per cent., Jains; and 42,235, or over 2 per cent., Animists. Among the Hindus there are some D\u0101d\u016bpanthis (a sect described in the article on Naraina in the Jaipur State, which is their head-quarters), but their number was not recorded at the last Census. In addition to the two subdivisions of the sect mentioned in that article, there is a third which\nis said to be peculiar to Jodhpur and is called Gharb\u0101ri. Its members marry and are consequently not recognized in Jaipur as true D\u0101d\u016bpanthis. Another sect of Hindus deserving of notice is that of the Bishnois, who number over 37,000, and derive their name from their creed of twenty-nine (bis + nau) articles. The Bishnois are all J\u0101ts by tribe, and are strict vegetarians, teetotallers, and non-smokers; they bury their dead sometimes in a sitting posture and almost always at the threshold of the house or in the adjoining cattle-shed, take neither food nor water from any other caste, and have their own special priests. The language mainly spoken throughout the State is M\u0101rw\u0101r\u012b, the most important of the four main groups of R\u0101jasth\u0101n\u012b.\n\nAmong castes and tribes the J\u0101ts come first, numbering 220,000, or over 11 per cent. of the total. They are robust and hard-working and the best cultivators in the State, famed for their diligence in improving the land. Next come the Br\u0101hmans (192,000, or nearly 10 per cent.). The principal divisions are the Srim\u0101lis, the S\u0101nchoras, the Pushkarnas, the Nandw\u0101na Bor\u0101hs, the Chenniy\u0101ts, the Purohits, and the P\u0101liw\u0101ls. They are mostly cultivators, but some are priests or money-lenders or in service. The third most numerous caste is that of the R\u0101jputs (181,000, or over 9 per cent.). They consider any pursuit other than that of arms or government as derogatory to their dignity, and are consequently indifferent cultivators. The principal R\u0101jput clan is that of the ruling family, namely R\u0101thor, comprising more than 100 septs, the chief of which are Mertia, Jodha, Ud\u0101wat, Champ\u0101wat, K\u016bmp\u0101wat, Karnot, Jait\u0101wat, and Karamsot. After the R\u0101jputs come the Mah\u0101jans (171,000, or nearly 9 per cent.). They belong mostly to the Osw\u0101l, Mahesri, Porw\u0101l, Saraogi, and Agarw\u0101l subdivisions, and are traders and bankers, some having agencies in the remotest parts of India, while a few are in State service. The only other caste exceeding 100,000 is that of the B\u0101lais, or Bh\u0101mbis (142,000, or over 7 per cent.). They are among the very lowest castes, and are workers in leather, village drudges, and to a small extent agriculturists. Those who remove the carcasses of dead animals from villages or towns are called Dheds. Other fairly numerous castes are the Reb\u0101ris (67,000), breeders of camels, sheep, and goats; the M\u0101lis (55,000), market-gardeners and agriculturists; the Ch\u0101kars or Gol\u0101s (55,000), the illegitimate offspring of R\u0101jputs, on whom they attend as hereditary servants; and lastly the Kumh\u0101rs (51,000), potters, brick-burners, village menials, and, to a small extent, cultivators. Taking the population as a whole, more than 58 per cent. live by the land and about another 3 per cent. are partially agriculturists. Nearly 5 per cent. are engaged in the cotton industry or as tailors, &c.; more than 4 per cent. are stock-breeders and dealers, while commerce and general labour employ over 3 per cent. each.\n\nChristians number 224, of whom 111 are natives. The United Free\nChurch of Scotland Mission has had a branch at Jodhpur city since 1885.\n\nAs already remarked, Jodhpur is, speaking generally, a sandy tract, improving gradually from a mere desert in the west to comparatively fertile lands along the eastern border. The chief natural soils are *mattiy\u0101li*, *bh\u016bri*, *retli*, and *magra* or *tharra*. The first is a clayey loam of three kinds, namely *k\u0101li* (black), *r\u0101ti* (red), and *p\u012bli* (yellowish), and covers about 18 per cent. of the cultivated area. It does not need frequent manuring, but being stiff requires a good deal of labour; it produces wheat, gram, and cotton, and can be tilled for many years in succession. The second is the most prevalent soil (occupying over 58 per cent. of the cultivated area) and requires but moderate rains. It has less clay than *mattiy\u0101li* and is brown in colour; it is easily amenable to the plough, requires manure, and is generally tilled for three or four years and then left fallow for a similar period. The third class of soil (*retli*) is fine-grained and sandy without any clay, and forms about 19 per cent. of the cultivated area. When found in a depression, it is called *dehri*, and, as it retains the drainage of the adjacent high-lying land, yields good crops of *bajra* and *jow\u0101r*; but when on hillocks or mounds, it is called *dhora*, and the sand being coarse-grained, it is a very poor soil requiring frequent rest. *Magra* is a hard soil containing a considerable quantity of stones and pebbles; it is found generally near the slopes of hills, and occupies about 4 per cent. of the cultivated area. The agricultural methods employed are of the simplest description. For the autumn crops, ploughing operations begin with the first fall of sufficient rain (not less than one inch), and the land is ploughed once, twice, or three times, according to the stiffness of the soil. Either a camel or a pair of bullocks is yoked to each plough, but sometimes donkeys or buffaloes are used. More trouble is taken with the cultivation of the spring crops. The land is ploughed from five to seven times, is harrowed and levelled, and more attention is paid to weeding.\n\nIn a considerable portion of the State there is practically only one harvest, the *khari\u015b*, or, as it is called here, *s\u0101wn\u016b*; and the principal crops are *bajra*, *jow\u0101r*, *moth*, *til*, maize, and cotton. The cultivation of *r\u0101bi*, or *un\u0101lu* crops, such as wheat, barley, gram, and mustard seed, is confined to the fertile portion enclosed within the branches of the Luni river, to the favoured districts along the eastern frontier, and to such other parts as possess wells. Agricultural statistics are available for only a portion of the *kh\u0101lsa* area (i.e. land paying revenue direct to the State), measuring nearly 4,320 square miles. Of this area, 1,012 square miles (or more than 23 per cent.) were cultivated in 1903\u20134; and the following were the areas in square miles under the principal crops: *bajra*, 430; *jow\u0101r*, 151; wheat, 81; *til*, 66; barley, 23; and cotton, 11.\nOf the total cultivated area above mentioned, 150 square miles (or nearly 15 per cent.) were irrigated in 1903-4: namely, 111 from wells, 12 from canals and tanks, and 27 from other sources. There are, in kh\u0101lsa territory, 22 tanks, the most important of which are the Jaswant S\u0101gar and Sard\u0101r Samand, called after the late and the present chief respectively. Irrigation is mainly from wells, of which there are 7,355 in the kh\u0101lsa area. The water is raised sometimes by means of the Persian wheel, and sometimes in leathern buckets. A masonry well costs from Rs. 300 to Rs. 1,000, and a kachch\u0101 well, which will last many years, from Rs. 150 to Rs. 300. Shallow wells are dug yearly along the banks of rivers at a cost of Rs. 10 to Rs. 20 each, and the water is lifted by a contrivance called ch\u0101nchh, which consists of a horizontal wooden beam balanced on a vertical post with a heavy weight at one end and a small leathern bucket or earthen jar at the other.\n\nThe main wealth of the desert land consists of the vast herds of camels, cattle, and sheep which roam over its sandy wastes and thrive admirably in the dry climate. The best riding camels of M\u0101rw\u0101r breed come from Sheo in the west and are known as R\u0101ma Thalia; they are said to cover 80 or even 100 miles in a night. Mall\u0101ni, Phalodi, Shergarh, and S\u0101nkra also supply good riding camels, the price of which ranges from Rs. 150 to Rs. 300. The bullocks of N\u0101gaur are famous throughout India; a good pair will sometimes fetch over Rs. 300, but the average price is Rs. 150. The districts of S\u0101nchor and Mall\u0101ni are remarkable for their breed of milch cows and horses. The latter are noted for their hardiness and ease of pace. The principal horse and cattle fairs are held at Parbatsar in September and at Tilw\u0101ra (near B\u0101latra) in March.\n\nForests cover an area of about 355 square miles, mostly in the east and south-east. They are managed by a department which was organized in 1888. There are three zones of vegetation. On the higher slopes are found s\u0101lar (Boswellia thurifera), gol (Odina Wodier), karayia (Sterculia urens), and golia dhaq (Anogeissus latifolia). On the lower hills and slopes the principal trees are the dhaq (Anogeissus pendula) and s\u0101lar; while hugging the valleys and at the foot of the slopes are dh\u0101k (Butea frondosa), ber (Zizyphus Jujuba), khair (Acacia Catechu), dh\u0101man (Grewia pilosa), &c. The forests are entirely closed to camels, sheep, and goats, but cattle are admitted except during the rains. Right-holders obtain forest produce free or at reduced rates, and in years of scarcity the forests are thrown open to the public for grazing, grass-cutting, and the collection of fruits, flowers, &c. The forest revenue in 1904-5 was about Rs. 31,000, and the expenditure Rs. 20,000.\n\nThe principal mineral found in the State is salt. Its manufacture is\npractically a monopoly of the British Government, and is carried on extensively at the S\u0101mbhar Lake, and at D\u012bdw\u0101na and Pachbhadra. Marble is mostly obtained from Makr\u0101na near the S\u0101mbhar Lake, but an inferior variety is met with at various points in the Aravalli Hills, chiefly at Son\u0101na near Desuri in the south-east. The average yearly out-turn is about 1,000 tons, and the royalty paid to the Darb\u0101r ranges from Rs. 16,000 to Rs. 20,000. Sandstone is plentiful in many parts, but varies greatly in texture and in colour. It is quarried in slabs and blocks, large and small, takes a fine polish, and is very suitable for carving and lattice-work. The yearly out-turn is about 6,000 tons. Among minerals of minor importance may be mentioned gypsum, used as cement throughout the country, and found chiefly near N\u0101gaur; and fuller's earth, existing in beds 5 to 8 feet below the surface in the Phalodi district and near B\u0101rmer, which is largely used as a hair-wash.\n\nThe manufactures are not remarkable from a commercial point of view. Weaving is an important branch of the ordinary village industry, but nothing beyond coarse cotton and woollen cloths is attempted. Parts of the Jodhpur and Godw\u0101r districts are locally famous for their dyeing and printing of cotton fabrics. Turbans for men and scarves for women, dyed and prepared with much labour, together with embroidered silk knotted thread for wearing on the turban, are peculiar to the State. Other manufactures include brass and iron utensils at Jodhpur and N\u0101gaur, ivory-work at P\u0101li and Merta, lacquer-work at Jodhpur, N\u0101gaur, and Bagri (in the Sojat district), marble toys, &c., at Makr\u0101na, felt rugs in the Mall\u0101ni and Merta districts, saddles and bridles at Sojat, and camel-trappings and millstones at B\u0101rmer. The Darb\u0101r has its own ice and aerated water factory, and there are five wool and cotton-presses belonging to private individuals.\n\nThe chief exports are salt, animals, hides, bones, wool, cotton, oil-seeds, marble, sandstone, and millstones; while the chief imports include wheat, barley, maize, gram, rice, sugar, opium, dry fruits, metals, oil, tobacco, timber, and piece-goods. It is estimated that 80 per cent. of the exports and imports are carried by the railway, and the rest by camels, carts, and donkeys, chiefly the former.\n\nThe R\u0101jput\u0101na-M\u0101lw\u0101 Railway traverses the south-eastern part of the State, and this section was opened for traffic in 1879\u201380; its length in Jodhpur territory is about 114 miles, and there are 16 stations. A branch of this railway from S\u0101mbhar to Kuch\u0101wan Road (in the north-east), opened about the same time, has a length of 15 miles with two stations (excluding S\u0101mbhar). The State has also a railway of its own, constructed gradually between 1881 and 1900, which forms part of the system known as the Jodhpur-Bikaner Railway. This line runs north-west from M\u0101lw\u0101 Junction, on the R\u0101jput\u0101na-M\u0101lw\u0101 Railway,\nto L\u016bni junction, and thence (1) to the western border of the State in the direction of Hyder\u0101b\u0101d in Sind, and (2) north to Jodhpur city. From the latter it runs north-east past Merta Road to Kuch\u0101wan Road, where it again joins the R\u0101jput\u0101na-M\u0101lw\u0101 Railway, and from Merta Road it runs north-west to Bikaner and Bhatinda. The section within Jodhpur limits has a length of 455 miles, and the total capital outlay to the end of 1904 was nearly 122 lakhs. The mean percentage of net earnings on capital outlay from the commencement of operations to the end of 1904 has been 7\u00b790, with a minimum of 3\u00b792 and a maximum of 11\u00b740. In 1904 the gross working expenses were 7\u00b73 lakhs and the net receipts 9\u00b76 lakhs, yielding a profit of 7\u00b786 per cent. on the capital outlay.\n\nThe total length of metalled roads is about 47 miles and of unmetalled roads 108 miles. All are maintained by the State. The metalled roads are almost entirely in or near the capital, while the principal unmetalled communication is a portion of the old Agra-Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d road. It was constructed between 1869 and 1875, was originally metalled, and cost nearly 5 lakhs, to which the British Government contributed Rs. 84,000. It runs from near Be\u0101war to Erinpura, and, having been superseded by the railway, is now maintained merely as a fair-weather communication.\n\nThe Darb\u0101r adopted Imperial postal unity in 1885\u20136; and there are now nearly 100 British post offices and five telegraph offices in the State, in addition to the telegraph offices at the numerous railway stations.\n\nThe country falls within the area of constant drought, and is liable to frequent famines or years of scarcity. A local proverb tells one to expect \u2018one lean year in three, one famine year in eight\u2019; and it has proved very true, for since 1792 the State has been visited by seventeen famines. Of those prior to 1868, few details are on record, but the year 1812\u201313 is described as having been a most calamitous one. The crops failed completely; food-stuffs sold at 3 seers for the rupee, and in places could not be purchased at any price; and the mortality among human beings was appalling. The famine of 1868\u20139 was one of the severest on record. There was a little rain in June and July, 1868, but none subsequently in that year; the grain-crops failed and forage was so scarce in some places that, while wheat was selling at 6, the price of grass was $5\\frac{1}{2}$ seers per rupee. The import duty on grain was abolished, and food was distributed at various places by some of the R\u0101n\u012bs, Th\u0101kurs, and wealthy inhabitants; but the Darb\u0101r, beyond placing a lakh of rupees at the disposal of the Public Works department, did nothing. The highest recorded price of wheat was $3\\frac{3}{4}$ seers per rupee at Jodhpur city, but even here and at P\u0101li (the two\nprincipal marts) no grain was to be had for days together. Cholera broke out in 1869 and was followed by a severe type of fever, and it was estimated that from these causes and from starvation the State lost one-third of its population. The mortality among cattle was put at 85 per cent. The next great famine was in 1877-8. The rainfall was only $4\\frac{1}{2}$ inches; the kharif crops yielded one-fourth and the rabi one-fifth of the normal out-turn, and there was a severe grass famine. Large numbers emigrated to Gujar\u0101t and M\u0101lw\u0101 with their cattle, and the Darb\u0101r arranged to bring the majority back at the public expense, but it was estimated that 20,000 persons and 80,000 head of cattle were lost. This bad season is said to have cost the State about 10 lakhs. The year 1891-2 was one of triple famine (grain, water, and fodder), the distress being most acute in the western districts. About 200,000 persons emigrated with 662,000 cattle, and only 63 per cent. of the former and 58 per cent. of the latter are said to have returned. The Darb\u0101r opened numerous relief works and poorhouses; the railway proved a great boon, and there was much private charity. Direct expenditure exceeded $5\\frac{1}{2}$ lakhs, while remissions and suspensions of land revenue amounted respectively to about 2-8 and 1-6 lakhs. A succession of bad seasons, commencing from 1895-6, culminated in the terrible famine of 1899-1900. At the capital less than half an inch of rain fell in 1899, chiefly in June, while in two of the western districts the total fall was only one-seventh of an inch. Emigration with cattle began in August, but it was long before the people realized that M\u0101lw\u0101, where salvation is usually to be found, was equally afflicted by drought. Some thousands were brought back by railway to relief works in Jodhpur at the expense of the Darb\u0101r, and thousands more toiled back by road, after losing their cattle and selling all their household possessions. Relief works and poorhouses were started on an extensive scale in the autumn of 1899 and kept open till September, 1900. During this period nearly 30 million units were relieved. The total cost to the Darb\u0101r exceeded 29 lakhs, and in addition nearly $9\\frac{3}{4}$ lakhs of land revenue, or about 90 per cent. of the demand, was remitted. A virulent type of malarial fever which, as in 1869, immediately followed the famine, claimed many victims. There was no fodder-crop worthy of the name throughout the State, and for some time grass was nearly as dear as grain. The mortality among the cattle was estimated at nearly a million and a half. Since then, the State suffered from scarcity in 1902 in the western districts, and again in 1905.\n\nFor administrative purposes, Jodhpur is divided into twenty-three districts or huk\u016bmats (each under an officer called h\u0101kim). In Mall\u0101ni, however, there is, in consequence of its peculiar tenure, size, and recent restoration to the Darb\u0101r, an official termed Superintendent, while the north-eastern districts\nhave also a Superintendent to dispose of border cases under the extradition agreement entered into with the Jaipur and Bikaner Darb\u0101rs.\n\nThe State is ordinarily governed by the Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101, assisted by the Mahakma kh\u0101s (a special department consisting of two members) and a consultative Council; but, during the absence of His Highness, first with the Imperial Cadet Corps and next at Pachmarhi in search of health, the administration has, since 1902, been carried on by the Mahakma kh\u0101s under the general supervision and control of the Resident.\n\nFor the guidance of its judiciary the State has its own codes and laws, which follow generally the similar enactments of British India. There are now 41 Darb\u0101r courts and 44 j\u0101gird\u0101rs' courts possessing various powers.\n\nThe normal revenue of the State is between 55 and 56 lakhs, and the expenditure about 36 lakhs. The chief sources of revenue are: salt, including treaty payments, royalty, &c., about 16 lakhs; customs, 10 to 11 lakhs; land (including irrigation), 8 to 9 lakhs; railway, about 8 lakhs (net); and tribute from j\u0101gird\u0101rs and succession fees, &c., about 3\u00bd lakhs. The main items of expenditure are: army (including police), about 7\u00be lakhs; civil establishment, 4 lakhs; public works (ordinary), 3 to 4 lakhs; palace and household, about 3 lakhs; and tribute (including payment for the Erinpura Regiment), nearly 2\u00bc lakhs. During the last few years the expenditure has purposely been kept low, in order to extricate the State from its indebtedness; but now that the financial outlook is brighter, an increased expenditure under various items, such as police, public works, and education, may be expected.\n\nThe State had formerly its own silver coinage, one issue being known as Bijai sh\u0101hi and another as Iktisanda. The Iktisanda rupee was worth from 10 to 12 British annas, while the value of the Bijai sh\u0101hi was generally much the same as, and sometimes greater than, that of the British rupee. After 1893 exchange fluctuated greatly till, in 1899, 122\u00be Bijai sh\u0101hi rupees exchanged for 100 British. The Darb\u0101r thereupon resolved to convert its local coins, and the British silver currency has been made the sole legal tender in the State. In 1900 more than 10,000,000 rupees were recoined at the Calcutta mint.\n\nOf the 4,030 villages in the State only 690 are kh\u0101lsa, or under the direct management of the Darb\u0101r, and they occupy about one-seventh of the entire area of the State. The rest of the land is held by j\u0101gird\u0101rs, bh\u016bmi\u0101s, and in\u0101md\u0101rs, or by Br\u0101hmans, Ch\u0101rans, or religious and charitable institutions on the s\u0101san or dokli tenure, or in lieu of pay (pasaita), or for maintenance (jivka), &c., &c. The ordinary j\u0101gird\u0101rs pay a yearly military cess, supposed to be 8 per cent. of the gross rental value (rekh) of their estates, and have to supply one horse-\nman for every Rs. 1,000 of rekh. In the smaller estates they supply one foot-soldier for every Rs. 500, or one camel sow\u0101r for every Rs. 750. In some cases the j\u0101gird\u0101r, instead of supplying horsemen, &c., makes a cash payment according to a scale fixed by the Darb\u0101r. J\u0101gird\u0101rs have also to pay hukmn\u0101ma or fee on succession, namely 75 per cent. of the annual rental value of their estates; but, in the case of a son or grandson succeeding, no cess is levied or service demanded for that year, while if a more distant relative succeeds the service alone is excused. The Th\u0101kurs of Mall\u0101ni, holding prior to the R\u0101thor conquest, pay a fixed sum (faujbal) yearly and have no further obligations. The bhumi\u0101s have to perform certain services, such as protecting their villages, escorting treasure, and guarding officials when on tour, and some pay a quit-rent called bh\u016bm-b\u0101b; provided these conditions are satisfied, and they conduct themselves peaceably, their lands are not resumed. In\u0101m is a rent-free grant for services rendered; it lapses on the failure of lineal descendants of the original grantee, and is sometimes granted for a single life only. S\u0101sam and dohli lands are granted in charity on conditions similar to in\u0101m, and cannot be sold. Jivka is a grant to the younger sons of the chief or of a Th\u0101kur. After three generations the holder has to pay cess and succession fee, and supply militia like the ordinary j\u0101gird\u0101r, and on failure of lineal descendants of the original grantee the land reverts to the family of the donor. In the kh\u0101lsa area the proprietary right rests with the Darb\u0101r, which deals directly with the ryots. The latter may be b\u0101pid\u0101rs, possessing occupancy rights and paying at favoured rates, or gair-b\u0101pid\u0101rs, tenants-at-will.\n\nFormerly the land revenue was paid almost entirely in kind. The most prevalent system was that known as \u012bt\u0101 or batai, by which the produce was collected near the village and duly measured or weighed. The share taken by the Darb\u0101r varied from one-fifth to one-half in the case of \u2018dry,\u2019 and from one-sixth to one-third in the case of \u2018wet\u2019 crops. This mode still prevails in some of the alienated villages, but in the kh\u0101lsa area a system of cash rents has been in force since 1894. The first and only regular settlement was made between 1894 and 1896 in 566 of the kh\u0101lsa villages (originally for a period of ten years). It is on the ryotw\u0101ri system. The village area is divided into (1) secure, i.e. irrigated from wells or tanks, where the yearly out-turn varies but slightly, and remissions of revenue are necessary only in years of dire famine; and (2) insecure, or solely dependent on the rainfall. In the former portion the assessment is fixed, and in the latter it fluctuates in proportion to the out-turn of the year. The basis of the assessment was the old batai collections together with certain cesses, and the gross yield was calculated from the results of crop experiments made at the time, supplemented by local inquiries. The rates per acre of\nwet' land range from Rs. 2\u20135\u20136 to Rs. 10 (average, Rs. 2\u201310 6), while those for 'dry' land range from 1\u00bc to 1\u00bd annas (average, 4\u00bd annas).\n\nThe State maintains two regiments of Imperial Service Lancers (normal strength 605 per regiment), and a local force consisting of about 600 cavalry (including camel sow\u0101rs) and 2,400 infantry. The artillery numbers 254 of all ranks, and there are 121 guns of various kinds, of which 75 (namely, 45 field and 30 fort) are said to be serviceable. In addition, the irregular militia supplied by the j\u0101gird\u0101rs mustered 2,019 in 1904\u20135: namely, 1,785 mounted men and 234 infantry. The Imperial Service regiments were raised between 1889 and 1893, and are called the Sard\u0101r Ris\u0101la, after the present chief. Their cost in 1904\u20135, when they were considerably below strength, was about 3\u00b72 lakhs. The first regiment formed part of the reserve brigade of the Tirah Field Force in 1897\u20138, and two detachments did well on convoy duty; the same regiment was on active service in China in 1900\u20131, was largely represented in the expedition to the Laush\u0101n hill and Chinasai, and was permitted to bear on its colours and appointments the honorary distinction 'China, 1900.' There are no cantonments in the State, but the Darb\u0101r contributes a sum of 1\u00b72 lakhs yearly towards the cost of the 43rd (Erinpura) Regiment (see Erinpura).\n\nPolice duties have hitherto been performed by the local force above mentioned; but since August, 1905, a regular police force under an Inspector-General, numbering about 1,500 of all ranks and estimated to cost about 2\u00bd lakhs a year, has been formed. In addition, a small force is employed on the Jodhpur-Bikaner Railway.\n\nBesides the Central jail at the capital, there are subsidiary jails at the head-quarters of the several districts, in which persons sentenced to three months' imprisonment or less are confined, and lock-ups for under-trial prisoners at each th\u0101na or police-station.\n\nIn the literacy of its population Jodhpur stands second among the twenty States and chiefships of R\u0101jputana, with 5\u00b74 per cent. (10 males and 0\u00b73 females) able to read and write. Excluding numerous indigenous schools, such as Hindu p\u014ds\u0101ls and Musalm\u0101n maktabs, 4 private institutions maintained by certain castes but aided by the Darb\u0101r, and a Mission girls' school, there were, in 1905, 33 educational institutions kept up by the State, one of which was for girls. The number on the rolls was nearly 2,300 (more than 50 per cent. being Mah\u0101jans and Br\u0101hmans, and 12 per cent. Musalm\u0101ns), and the daily average attendance during 1904\u20135 was about 1,740. The most notable institutions are at the capital: namely, the Arts college, the high school, and the Sanskrit school. Save at the small railway school at Merta Road, where a monthly fee of 2 or 4 annas per pupil is taken, education is free throughout the State, and the expenditure exceeds Rs. 44,000 a year.\nThere are 24 hospitals and 8 dispensaries in the State, which have accommodation for 342 in-patients. In 1904 more than 178,000 cases, including nearly 3,000 in-patients, were treated, and about 7,700 operations were performed. The State expenditure on medical institutions, including allowances to the Residency Surgeon, is approximately Rs. 70,000 yearly.\n\nVaccination was started about 1866, is compulsory throughout the State, and not unpopular. A staff of 2 superintendents and 22 vaccinators is maintained, and in 1904\u20135 they successfully vaccinated 61,000 persons, or nearly 32 per 1,000 of the population.\n\n[C. K. M.

The population of the city (including the suburbs) was: (1881) 63,329, (1891) 80,405, and (1901) 79,109. In the two years last mentioned between 76 and 77 per cent. of the inhabitants lived within the city walls. In 1901 Hindus numbered 58,292, or more than 73 per cent. of the total; Musalmans, 15,811, or 20 per cent.; and Jains, 4,571, or 5 per cent.\n\nJodhpur takes its name from Rao Jodha, who founded it in 1459. The old wall with four gates built by him is now included within the limits, and is situated in the south-west of the modern city, which lies on sloping ground in the form of a horseshoe around the base of the rock on which stands the fort. It is encircled by a strong massive wall, built in the first half of the eighteenth century, which is 24,600 feet long, 3 to 9 feet thick, and 15 to 30 feet high, and has six gates studded with sharp iron spikes to protect them against elephant ramming. Of these gates, five are called after the towns which they face, namely Jalor, Merta, Nagaur, Siwana, and Sojat, while the sixth is named Chand Pol because it faces the direction in which the new moon (*chand*) is visible. The walls and towers near the Nagaur Gate show marks of cannon-balls left by the armies of Jaipur and Bikaner which, with the aid of the great freebooter, Amir Khan, marched on Jodhpur about 1807 to support the pretender Dhonkal Singh against Maharaja Man Singh. Eventually Amir Khan changed over to the side of the latter, and the insurgents were forced to retire with considerable loss and ignominy. The fort, which is the finest in Rajputana, commands the city and, standing in great magnificence on an isolated rock about 400 feet above the sur-\nrounding plain, attracts the eye from afar. Its wall, 20 to 120 feet in height and 12 to 70 feet thick, encloses an oblong space about 500 yards in length by 250 in breadth at the widest part. Two main entrances, the Jai Pol at the north-east corner and the Fateh Pol in the south-west, lead up from the city, and between them are several other gates and inner walls erected for purposes of defence. The principal buildings in the fort are a series of apartments forming the palace, the most noteworthy being the Moti Mahal, built by R\u0101j\u0101 S\u016br Singh in the beginning of the seventeenth century, the Fateh Mahal, built by Mah\u0101-r\u0101j\u0101 Ajit Singh about 100 years later to commemorate the retirement of the Mughal army from his capital, and the room now used as an armouery. These buildings are decorated with beautifully carved panels and pierced screens of red stone. The city contains many handsome buildings, including ten old palaces, some town residences of the Th\u0101kurs, and eleven fine temples, the most beautiful architecturally being the Kunj Bih\u0101ri-k\u0101-mandar, built in the latter half of the eighteenth century.\n\nJodhpur is a trading centre, but its industries are unimportant, consisting of lacquer-work, dyeing of cotton cloths, and the manufacture of brass and iron utensils. The main streets are paved; and a light tramway of 2 feet gauge, laid down in 1896 between the railway station and the city, the cars being drawn by bullocks, has proved of great convenience to the public, and has considerably reduced the cost of carriage of grain and other commodities. A municipal committee (established in 1884) attends to the sanitation of the city, and settles disputes relating to rights of easement, &c., the annual expenditure of about Rs. 20,000 being borne solely by the Darb\u0101r. A tramway line, worked by buffaloes, runs round the city, passing all but one of the public latrines. Twice a day the loaded wagons are collected and formed into trains outside the Sojatia Gate, whence they are hauled by steam-power a distance of about 5 miles into the open country, where the filth is trenched and the refuse burnt. This steam conservancy tramway is the first of its kind in R\u0101jput\u0101na. The total length of the line, including the section worked by buffaloes, and an extension up to and round the Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101's stables, now exceeds 13 miles. It was completed between 1897 and 1899 at a cost of more than 1\u00bd lakhs, and the working expenses average about Rs. 7,000 a year. Within the city are three hospitals and a couple of dispensaries. Of the hospitals, one is solely for females and another is maintained by the United Free Church of Scotland Mission. In the suburbs there are hospitals attached to the jail and the Imperial Service cavalry regiments, and a couple of dispensaries, one of which is close to the Residency and is kept up by the British Government, while the other is for railway employ\u00e9s. The city possesses an Arts college, a high school with lower secondary and\nprimary sections, and a boarding-house for fifty R\u0101jput boys; also two primary schools, a girls' school, and three special institutions where Sanskrit, telegraphy, and surveying are taught. These are all maintained by the Darb\u0101r and are for the most part in the suburbs; there are, in addition, numerous private schools in the city. The principal buildings in the suburbs are the late Mah\u0101r\u0101ja's palace at Rai-k\u0101-b\u0101gh, the fine new palace at Ratan\u0101da which is lighted by electricity, the Imperial Service cavalry lines, the handsome public offices, the Residency and other official buildings, and the jail with accommodation for 862 prisoners.\n\n**Jodiya.**\u2014Town and chief port of Nav\u0101nagar State, K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r, Bombay, situated in $22^\\circ 40'$ N. and $70^\\circ 26'$ E., about 24 miles north-east of Nav\u0101nagar town, 46 miles north-west of R\u0101jkot, and 40 miles west of Morvi. Population (1901), 7,321. The port was formerly a fishing village on the south-eastern shores of the Gulf of Cutch. The wharf is about a mile and a half distant from the town, with which it is connected by a good made road. A custom-house and a press for cotton and wool bales are at the wharf. The water off this part of the coast is too shallow for ships of any considerable burden. According to a local legend, the Gulf from Jodiya to the opposite coast of Cutch could be crossed by a footpath at low water 200 years ago. The north-west bastion of the fort, 80 feet above the sea, the palace or darb\u0101r house, 300 yards south-east of the bastion, and a grove of trees, a mile to the south and outside the town, are high and conspicuous marks when nearing the port from seaward. The town is surrounded by a wall with towers and a small interior fort. It has vernacular boys' and girls' schools and a dispensary.\n\n**Jogeshvari.**\u2014Cave in the Salsette t\u0101luka of Th\u0101na District, Bombay, situated in $19^\\circ 13'$ N. and $72^\\circ 59'$ E., $2\\frac{1}{2}$ miles south-east of Goregaon station, on the Bombay, Baroda, and Central India Railway. It is the third largest of the great Br\u0101hmanical caves of India, the others being S\u012bt\u0101's Bath at Ellora and the Great Cave at Elephanta. Its length is 240 and breadth 200 feet. This cave-temple, which dates from the seventh century, contains rock-cut passages, an immense central hall supported by pillars, porticoes, and subsidiary courts.\n\n[Du Perron (1760), *Zend Avesta*, vol. i, pp. cclxxxviii\u2013cccxc; Hunter (1784), *Archaeologia*, vol. vii, pp. 295\u20139; Salt (1806), *Transactions of the Bombay Literary Society*, vol. i, pp. 44\u20137; *Bombay Gazetteer*, vol. xiv, pp. 110\u20132.]\n\n**Jogighop\u0101.**\u2014Village in Go\u0101lp\u0101ra District, Eastern Bengal and Assam, situated in $26^\\circ 14'$ N. and $90^\\circ 34'$ E., on the north bank of the Brahmaputra at the point where it is joined by the Man\u0101s. Population (1901), 734. A steam ferry plies between Jogighop\u0101 and Go\u0101lp\u0101ra, and the telegraph wires are carried beneath the river at this point to the south bank. Prior to the annexation of Assam, Jogighop\u0101 was\na frontier outpost of Bengal, and a number of Europeans resided here, who forcibly obtained a monopoly of the Bengal trade and were thus enabled to do a lucrative business with the natives who enjoyed similar privileges in Assam. Four large tombs remain as evidence of their occupation, but the inscriptions have disappeared. Jogighop\u0101 derives its name from some caves cut out of the rocks near the river bank, which at one time used to be occupied by ascetics. The place is now of little importance, but contains a tahsil belonging to the Bijni estate.\n\n**Johi.**\u2014T\u0101luka of L\u0101rk\u0101na District, Sind, Bombay, lying between 26\u00b0 7' and 27\u00b0 N. and 67\u00b0 11' and 67\u00b0 47' E., with an area of 760 square miles. The population in 1901 was 51,218, compared with 51,919 in 1891. The t\u0101luka contains 87 villages, of which Johi is the head-quarters. The density, 67 persons per square mile, is much below the District average. In 1903-4 the land revenue and cesses amounted to 1.4 lakhs. About a quarter of the t\u0101luka is irrigated by the Western N\u0101ra system and the Manchhar Lake. The remainder depends upon the rainfall, and the harvest is therefore precarious. The soil has great capabilities, and with seasonable rain three crops of jow\u0101r are obtained from one sowing. Migration to the irrigated tracts accompanies years of scanty rainfall. The Kirthar Hills bound the t\u0101luka on the west.\n\n**Joll\u0101rp\u0113t.**\u2014Village and railway station in Salem District, Madras. See Jal\u0101rp\u0113t.\n\n**Joma-male.**\u2014Hill in Coorg. See Soma-male.\n\n**Jor\u0101.**\u2014Head-quarters of the Tonwargh\u0101r district of Gwalior State, Central India, situated in 26\u00b0 20' N. and 77\u00b0 49' E., on the Gwalior Light Railway. Population (1901), 2,551. The place is usually called Jor\u0101-Al\u0101pur, to distinguish it from other places of the same name. Al\u0101pur is a village lying a mile to the north. Jor\u0101 contains the ruins of an old fort built by the Karauli chiefs, the usual district offices, a school, a dispensary, a State post office, a sarai, a public works inspection bungalow, and a police station.\n\n**Jorh\u0101t Subdivision.**\u2014Central subdivision of Sibs\u0101gar District, Eastern Bengal and Assam, lying between 26\u00b0 22' and 27\u00b0 11' N. and 93\u00b0 57' and 94\u00b0 36' E., with an area of 819 square miles. About two-fifths of the subdivision lies north of the main channel of the Brahmaputra, and is known as the Majuli island, a comparatively sparsely peopled tract, liable to damage from flood. The part south of the river is one of the most populous portions of the Assam Valley, and in places has a density exceeding 600 persons per square mile. The swamps fringing the Brahmaputra are inundated in the rains; but farther inland stretches a broad plain, the lower part of which is cultivated with rice, while tea and sugar-cane are grown on the higher land.\nThe population in 1901 was 219,137, about one-fourth of which was enumerated on tea gardens, as compared with 181,152 in 1891. The subdivision contains one town, Jorh\u0101t (population, 2,899), the headquarters; and 651 villages. The annual rainfall at Jorh\u0101t town averages 80 inches, but on the eastern border of the subdivision it is a little higher. In 1904 there were altogether 56 tea gardens with 30,851 acres under plant, which gave employment to 62 Europeans and 36,849 natives. The subdivision is particularly well supplied with means of communication, as the Assam-Bengal Railway runs along the south-east, and at Tit\u0101bar and Mari\u0101ni meets a light state railway, which passes through Jorh\u0101t town to the Brahmaputra. The assessment for land revenue and local rates in 1903\u20134 was Rs. 5,79,000.\n\n**Jorh\u0101t Town.**\u2014Head-quarters of the subdivision of the same name in Sibs\u0101gar District, Eastern Bengal and Assam, situated in 26\u00b0 45' N. and 94\u00b0 13' E., on the left bank of the Disai river. The town had a population in 1901 of 2,899, and is administered as a Union under (Bengal) Act V of 1876, the expenditure in 1903\u20134 amounting to nearly Rs. 8,000. Jorh\u0101t was the capital of the Ahom R\u0101j\u0101s after Gaurin\u0101th Singh had been driven from Rangpur near Sibs\u0101gar at the end of the eighteenth century. It contains a fine tank of excellent water, on the banks of which the subdvisional officer's residence and office have been located, and the remains of considerable earthworks. There is a flourishing bazar, the largest shops in which are owned by M\u0101rw\u0101ri merchants, who do a large business with the tea gardens in the neighbourhood. The principal articles of import are cotton piece-goods, grain, salt and oil, the chief exports being mustard seed, cane, and hides. Furniture and haberdashery are sold by Muhammadan traders from Bengal. A colony of Telis has been formed in the town, who express mustard oil in the ordinary bullock-mills of Upper India; and Jorh\u0101t is the chief centre for the manufacture of Assamese jewellery, which usually consists of lac covered with gold and enamel and set with cheap stones. The public buildings include a small jail, a hospital with twenty-four beds, and two high schools which in 1903\u20134 had an average attendance of 452 boys. A daily market for the sale of native produce is numerously attended; and, owing to the density of the population and the presence of a large number of prosperous gardens in the neighbourhood, Jorh\u0101t has become the most important centre of trade in the District. A light state railway passes through the town, connecting it with the Brahmaputra at Kakil\u0101mukh and with the Assam-Bengal Railway at Mari\u0101ni and Tit\u0101bar. The transfer of the head-quarters of the District from Sibs\u0101gar to Jorh\u0101t has recently been sanctioned.\n\n**Joshimath.**\u2014Village in Garhw\u0101l District, United Provinces, situated in 30\u00b0 33' N. and 79\u00b0 35' E., at an elevation of 6,107 feet above sea-\nlevel and about 1,500 feet above the confluence of the Dhauli and Bishangang\u0101, the combined stream being known as the Alaknand\u0101. Population (1900), 468 in summer and a little larger in winter. It is chiefly remarkable as the winter head-quarters of the r\u0101wal or chief priest of the temple of Badr\u012bn\u0101th, who retires here after the snows have rendered the higher shrine inaccessible. The village contains several ancient temples, some of which have been much damaged by earthquakes. A police station is opened here during the pilgrim season.\n\nJot\u0101na.\u2014Petty State in Mah\u012b K\u0101nth\u0101, Bombay.\n\nJotiba's Hill (also called V\u0101di Ratn\u0101giri).\u2014Hill in the State of Kolh\u0101pur, Bombay, situated in 16\u00b0 48' N. and 74\u00b0 13' E., about 9 miles north-west of Kolh\u0101pur town. It rises about 1,000 feet from the plain in a truncated cone, and, though disconnected, forms part of the Panh\u0101la spur which stretches from the crest of the Western Gh\u0101ts to the Kistna. On the wooded hill-top is a small village with 1,400 inhabitants, mostly priests of Jotiba. From very ancient times this hill has been considered especially sacred. In the middle of the village is a group of temples, three of which are dedicated to Jotiba, under the names of Ked\u0101rling, Ked\u0101reshwar, and R\u0101mling. According to a local legend, Amb\u0101 Bai of Kolh\u0101pur, being disturbed by demons, went to Ked\u0101rn\u0101th in the Him\u0101laya hills, practised severe penance, and prayed him to destroy the demons. In answer to her prayers Ked\u0101reshwar came to Jotiba's Hill, bringing with him and setting up the present Ked\u0101r lingam. The original temple is said to have been built by one N\u0101vji Saya. In its place R\u0101noji Sindhia built the present temple in 1730. The second temple of Ked\u0101reshwar was built by Daulat Rao Sindhia in 1808. The third temple of R\u0101mling, including the dome, was built about 1780 by one M\u0101lji Nilam Panh\u0101lkar. In a small domed shrine in front of the temple of Ked\u0101reshwar are two sacred bulls of black stone. Close to these temples is a shrine sacred to Chopdai, which was built by Priti Rao Himmat Bah\u0101dur in 1760. A few yards outside of the village stands a temple of Yamai, built by R\u0101noji Sindhia. In front of this are two sacred cisterns, one of which is said to have been built by Jij\u0101b\u0101i S\u0101hib about 1743; the other, called J\u0101madagnya t\u012brth, was built by R\u0101noji Sindhia. Most of the temples on Jotiba's Hill are made of a fine blue basalt which is found on the hills. In many parts the style of architecture, which is strictly Hindu, is highly ornamented, several of the sculptured figures being covered with brass and silver plates. The chief object of worship is Jotiba, who, though called the son of the sage Pangand, is believed to have been Pangand himself, reincarnated to help the rulers of the Deccan in their fights with the demons. According to tradition, Jotiba's destruction of one of the demons named Ratn\u0101sur gave the\nplace the name of Ratn\u0101giri. In honour of the victory over the demon, on the full moon of Chaitra (March\u2013April) a yearly fair is held attended by 40,000 or 50,000 people, some of whom come from great distances. Besides this great fair, small fairs are held every Sunday and full moon day and on the 6th of the bright half of Shr\u0101van (August). On these days the image is carried round the temple in a litter with great pomp.\n\nJounpore.\u2014District, tahsil, and city, United Provinces. See JAUNPUR.\n\nJowai Subdivision.\u2014Subdivision of the Kh\u0101si and Jainti\u0101 Hills District, Eastern Bengal and Assam, lying between $24^\\circ 58'$ and $26^\\circ 3'N.$ and $91^\\circ 59'$ and $92^\\circ 51'E.$, with an area of 2,086 square miles. Jowai originally formed part of the territory of the Jainti\u0101 R\u0101j\u0101, and was acquired from him by the British in 1835. The population in 1901 was 67,921, as compared with 64,521 in 1891, giving a density of 33 persons per square mile. Most of the inhabitants are Syntengs, a tribe of Tibeto-Burman origin akin to the Kh\u0101sis. The subdivision contains 640 villages, and is in charge of a European Magistrate, whose head-quarters are at Jowai, a prosperous village with some local trade. The rainfall is recorded only at Jowai itself, where there is an average annual fall of 237 inches; but on the southern face of the hills the precipitation is probably even greater.\n\nJowai Village.\u2014Headquarters of the Jowai subdivision of the Kh\u0101si and Jainti\u0101 Hills District, Eastern Bengal and Assam, situated in $25^\\circ 26'N.$ and $92^\\circ 12'E.$, at a height of 4,422 feet above the sea. Population (1901), 3,511. Jowai is the head-quarters of the subdivisional officer, who is almost invariably a European, and it possesses a considerable trade. The chief exports are raw cotton and rubber; the imports are rice, dried fish, cotton goods, and salt. The average annual rainfall is 237 inches.\n\nJ\u016bba.\u2014Deserted fortress in the Surguj\u0101 State, Central Provinces, situated in $23^\\circ 43'N.$ and $83^\\circ 26'E.$, about 2 miles south-east of M\u0101npur\u0101 village. The fort stands on the rocky shoulder of a hill, and commands a deep gorge overgrown with jungle. Hidden among the trees are the remains of carved temples, almost covered with accumulations of vegetable mould.\n\nJubbal (Jubal).\u2014One of the Simla Hill States, Punjab, lying between $30^\\circ 46'$ and $31^\\circ 8'N.$ and $77^\\circ 27'$ and $77^\\circ 50'E.$, with an area of 288 square miles. Population (1901), 21,172. Jubbal was originally tributary to Sirm\u016br, but after the Gurkha War it became independent. The R\u0101n\u0101 misgoverned the State, and in 1832 abdicated in favour of the British Government, but soon, however, repented, and in 1840 the State was restored to him. His grandson, Padam Chand, ruled the State with ability from 1877 till his death in 1898, and was succeeded by Gy\u0101n Chand, the present R\u0101n\u0101, who is a minor. The State is now\nunder the management of a British official. The ruling family is by caste R\u0101thor R\u0101jput. The State contains 84 villages, including Deorha, its capital, and has an estimated revenue of nearly Rs. 1,52,000. The chief products are grain, tobacco, and opium.\n\n**Jubbulpore Division (Jabalpur).**\u2014Northern Division of the Central Provinces, lying between $21^\\circ 36'$ and $24^\\circ 27'$ N. and $78^\\circ 4'$ and $81^\\circ 45'$ E., with an area of 18,950 square miles. The head-quarters of the Commissioner are at Jubbulpore City. The Division contains five Districts, as shown below:\n\n| District   | Area in square miles | Population, 1901 | Land revenue and cesses, 1903-4, in thousands of rupees |\n|------------|----------------------|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| Saugor     | 3,962                | 469,479          | 5,852                                                    |\n| Damoh      | 2,816                | 285,326          | 3,89                                                     |\n| Jubbulpore | 3,912                | 680,585          | 9,67                                                     |\n| Mandla     | 5,054                | 318,400          | 1,97                                                     |\n| Seoni      | 3,206                | 327,709          | 3,13                                                     |\n| **Total**  | **18,950**           | **2,081,499**    | **24,18**                                                 |\n\n*The District figures of area and population have been adjusted to allow for some small transfers of territory since the Census of 1901.*\n\nOf these, Saugor and Damoh and the Murwara tahsil of Jubbulpore lie on the Vindhyan plateau to the north; the southern part of Jubbulpore is situated at the head of the narrow valley through which the Narbada river flows between the Vindhyan and S\u0101tpur\u0101 ranges; while Seoni and Mandla form part of the S\u0101tpur\u0101 plateau to the south. The Division therefore consists generally of hilly country, lying at a considerable elevation and enjoying a comparatively temperate climate. In 1881 the population of the Division was 2,201,573, which increased in 1891 to 2,375,610 or by 8 per cent. The increase was considerably below the average for the Province, the decade having been an unhealthy one, especially in Saugor and Damoh. In 1901 the population was 2,081,916, a decrease of 12 per cent. on the figures of 1891. Since the Census a small transfer of territory has taken place, and the adjusted population is 2,081,499. All Districts of the Division suffered severely from famine during the decade. In 1901 Hindus formed 74 per cent. of the total and Animists 20 per cent. There were 89,731 Musalmans, 29,918 Jains, and 5,878 Christians, of whom 2,706 were Europeans and Eurasians. The density of population is 110 persons per square mile, as compared with 112 for all British Districts of the Province. The Division contains 11 towns and 8,561 inhabited villages; but Jubbulpore City (90,316) and Saugor (42,330) are the only towns with a population of more than 20,000. Thirteen miles from Jubbulpore, at a gorge overhanging the Narbada river, are the well-known Marble Rocks.\nJubbulpore District.\u2014District in the Jubbulpore Division of the Central Provinces, lying between $22^\\circ 49'$ and $24^\\circ 8'$ N. and $79^\\circ 21'$ and $80^\\circ 58'$ E., at the head of what may be called the Narbad\u0101 Valley proper, with an area of 3,912 square miles. On the north and east it is bounded by the States of Maihar, Pann\u0101, and Rewah; on the west by Damoh District; and on the south by Narsinghpur, Seoni, and Mandl\u0101. The Narbad\u0101, entering the District from the Mandl\u0101 highlands on the south-east, winds circuitously through its southern portion, passing within 6 miles of the city of Jubbulpore, and finally leaves it on the south-western border. To the north of the Narbad\u0101 extends an open plain, bounded on the north-west by offshoots of the Vindhyan, and on the south-west by those of the S\u0101tpur\u0101 range. Farther to the north-west the surface becomes more uneven, small tracts of level alternating with broken and hilly country. The south-western plain, called the Haveli, is one of the richest and most fertile areas in the Province. It consists of a mass of embanked wheat-fields, and occupies the valley of the Hiran and Narbad\u0101 rivers, extending from the south-western border of the District as far north as the town of Sihor\u0101, and from the Hiran river flowing close beneath the Vindhyan Hills to the railway line, including also a tract round Saroli beyond the line. On the western bank of the Hiran, the Bh\u0101nr range of the Vindhyan system forms the boundary between Jubbulpore and Damoh. To the south-east of the Haveli lies a large tract of poor and hilly country, forming the northern foot-hills of the S\u0101tpur\u0101 range. North of the Haveli the Vindhyan and the S\u0101tpur\u0101 systems approach each other more closely, until they finally almost meet in the Murw\u0101ra tahsil. The Kaimur ridge of the Vindhya commencing at Katangi runs through the west of the Sihor\u0101 tahsil, and approaches Murw\u0101ra, leaving to the north-west a stretch of hill country with one or two small plateaux. On the east, the S\u0101tpur\u0101s run down to the railway between Sihor\u0101 and Sleeman\u0101b\u0101d, and from them a ridge extends northwards till it meets the Vindhyan system at Bijer\u0101ghogarh in the extreme north of the District. Between these ranges lie stretches of comparatively open country, less fertile than the Haveli. Lying at the junction of the Vindhyan and S\u0101tpur\u0101 ranges, Jubbulpore forms part of the great central watershed of India. The southern part of the District is drained by the Narbad\u0101 and its tributaries, the Hiran and Gaur. In the north the Mah\u0101nadi, after forming for some distance the boundary between Jubbulpore and Rewah, crosses the Murw\u0101ra tahsil and passes on to join the Son, a tributary of the Ganges. The Katni river flowing by Katni-Murw\u0101ra is an affluent of the Mah\u0101nadi. The Ken river rises in the Kaimur range on the west, but flows for only a short distance within the District.\n\nThe valley of the Narbad\u0101 from Jubbulpore to the western boundary\nis an alluvial flat, chiefly composed of a stiff red or brown clay with numerous intercalated bands of sand and gravel. Kankar abounds throughout the deposit, and pisolitic iron granules are of frequent occurrence. The southern and eastern portions of the District are generally covered by the Deccan trap. In the north is a continuous exposure of sub-metamorphic strata, consisting of fine earthy slate, quartzite, limestone, ribboned jasper passing locally into bluish quartzite, micaceous hematite and other rocks. In these rocks or in association with them the manganese, lead, and copper ores, and the richest iron ores of the District occur. The rocks round Jubbulpore are gneiss.\n\nThe plain country is well wooded with mango, tamarind, ber (Zizyphus jujuba), guava, mahu\u0101 (Bassia latifolia), and other fruit-bearing trees. Among the ornamental or quasi-religious trees are the banyan, pipal, and kachn\u0101r (Bauhinia variegata). The hills are covered with forest, which formerly suffered great loss from the annual clearing of patches by the hill tribes and from grass fires. The principal timber trees are teak, s\u0101j (Terminalia tomentosa), haldu (Adina cordifolia), tend\u016b or ebony (Diospyros tomentosa), and bamboos. Peaches and pineapples and excellent potatoes and other vegetables are also grown.\n\nThe usual wild animals and birds are found in Jubbulpore, and there is a considerable variety of game. Tigers and leopards are the common carnivora; and the deer and antelope tribe includes s\u0101mbhar, spotted deer, \u2018black buck,\u2019 and the chink\u0101ra or Indian gazelle.\n\nThe annual rainfall averages 59 inches, and is usually copious, that of Murw\u0101ra in the north being somewhat lighter and also apparently more variable. The climate is pleasant and salubrious. The average maximum temperature in May does not exceed 106\u00b0, and in the cold season light frosts are not infrequent.\n\nThe village of Tewar, lying a few miles from Jubbulpore, is the site of the old city of Tripura, or Karanbel, the capital of the Kalachuri dynasty. The information available about the Kalachuri or Chedi dynasty has been pieced together from a number of inscriptions found in Jubbulpore District, in Chhattisgarh, and in Benares. They belonged to the Haihaya Rajputs, and were a branch of the Ratanpur family who governed Chhattisgarh. Their rise to power possibly dates from shortly after the commencement of the Christian era, and they had an era of their own called the Chedi Samvat, which commenced in A.D. 249. For the first five or six centuries of their rule there remain only a few isolated facts; but for a period of three hundred years, from the ninth to the twelfth century, a complete genealogy has been drawn up. We have the names of eighteen kings, and occasional mention of their marriages or wars with\n\n---\n\n1 Records of the Archaeological Survey, vol. ix, p. 78 seq.\nthe surrounding principalities\u2014the R\u0101thors of Kanauj, the Chandels of Mahob\u0101, and the Param\u0101ras of M\u0101lw\u0101. Their territory comprised the upper valley of the Narbad\u0101. From the twelfth century nothing more is known of them, and the dynasty probably came to an end, eclipsed by the rising power of Rewah or Baghelkhand. At a subsequent period, probably about the fifteenth century, Jubbulpore was included in the territories of the Gond Garh\u0101-Mandl\u0101 dynasty, and Garh\u0101 was for some time their capital. On the subversion of the Gonds by the Mar\u0101th\u0101s in 1781, Jubbulpore formed part of the Saugor territories of the Peshw\u0101. It was transferred to the Bhonsla R\u0101j\u0101s of N\u0101gpur in 1798, and became British territory in 1818.\n\nIn 1857 Jubbulpore was garrisoned by the 52nd Native Infantry and was the head-quarters of Major Erskine, the Commissioner of the Saugor and Nerbudda Territories, then attached to the North-Western Provinces. In June, 1857, the demeanour of the native troops became suspicious, and the Europeans in the station were collected in the Residency, which was made defensible. The sepoys, however, remained quiet; and in August a movable column of Madras troops arrived from Kamptee, and were sent forward to restore order in the interior of Jubbulpore and Damoh Districts, which were in a very disturbed condition and were being raided by mutineers from Saugor. On September 18 the deposed Gond R\u0101j\u0101 of Garh\u0101-Mandl\u0101 and his son, who had been detected in a conspiracy against the British, were blown away from guns, and on that night the whole of the 52nd regiment quietly rose and left the station. The Madras troops who were then at Damoh were recalled, and on arriving at Katangi found the rebels on the farther bank of the Hiran river. The passage was forced and the enemy put to flight, and no serious disturbance occurred subsequently. The northern pargana of Bijer\u0101ghogarh was formerly a Native State. The chief was deposed for participation in the Mutiny, and his territory was incorporated in Jubbulpore District in 1865.\n\nThe relics of the different races and religions which at one time or another have been dominant in Jubbulpore are fairly numerous, but are now for the most part in ruins. Remains of numerous old Hindu temples and fragments of carved stone are found in a group of villages on the banks of the Ken river, north-west of Murw\u0101ra. These are Rithi, Chhoti-Deori, Simr\u0101, Pureni, and N\u0101ndch\u0101nd. The ruins at Bargaon belong to the Jains. Bilehri, a little to the south, was once a place of some note; but the only remains now existing are a great tank called Lachhman S\u0101gar, a smaller tank, and two temples. In the centre of the District the villages of Bahuriband, R\u016bpn\u0101th, and Tigw\u0101n contain another group of remains. Bahuriband ('many embankments') is believed to have once been the site of a large city, con-\njecturally identified by Cunningham with the Tholobana of Ptolemy. The only piece of antiquity now remaining is a large naked Jain statue, with an inscription of the Kalachuri dynasty of Tewar. A small hill at Tigw\u0101n, two miles from Bahuriband, is covered with blocks of cut stone, the ruins of many temples which have been destroyed by the railway contractors. At R\u016bpn\u0101th there is a famous lingam of Siva, which is placed in a cleft of the rock, where a stream pours over the Kaimur range; but the place is more interesting as being the site of one of the rock-inscriptions of Asoka. Separate mention is made of Garh\u0101, now included in the city of Jubbulpore.\n\nThe population of the District at the last three enumerations was as follows: (1881) 687,233, (1891) 748,146, and (1901) 680,585. The increase of 9 per cent. between 1881 and 1891 was smaller than that for the Province as a whole. During the last decade the loss of population has been 9 per cent., being least in the Murw\u0101ra tahsil. The District contains three towns, Jubbulpore City, Sihora, and Murw\u0101ra; and 2,298 inhabited villages. The principal statistics of population in 1901 are shown below:\n\n| Tahsil     | Area in square miles | Number of Towns | Villages | Population | Population per square mile | Percentage of variation in population between 1891 and 1901 | Number of persons able to read and write |\n|------------|---------------------|-----------------|----------|------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Jubbulpore | 1,519               | 1               | 1,076    | 332,488    | 219                       | - 8.1                                                        | 21,997                                 |\n| Sihora     | 1,197               | 1               | 706      | 186,424    | 156                       | - 1.5                                                        | 7,974                                  |\n| Murw\u0101ra    | 1,196               | 1               | 516      | 161,973    | 135                       | - 7.2                                                        | 6,745                                  |\n| District total | 3,912             | 3               | 2,298    | 680,585    | 174                       | - 9.0                                                        | 35,816                                 |\n\nThe figures for religion show that 87\u00bd per cent. of the people are Hindus, 5\u00bd per cent. Animists, and 5\u00bd per cent. Muhammadans, while there are 6,177 Jains. Nearly the whole population is returned as speaking the Bagheli dialect of Eastern Hindi; this form of the language closely resembles the dialects of Oudh and Chhattisgarh, and is found elsewhere in the Central Provinces only in Mandl\u0101. About 5,000 persons are returned as speaking Gondi.\n\nThe principal landholding castes are Br\u0101hmans (64,000), Bani\u0101s (17,000), Gonds (79,000), Kurmis (35,000), R\u0101jputs (17,000), and Lodhis (41,000). The Br\u0101hmans hold no very important estates, but numerous small ones, not infrequently assigned to them partly or wholly revenue-free from the time of the Gond rulers. Br\u0101hmans form 9 per cent. of the total population, a fact which is partly to be attributed to the number of sacred places on the Narbad\u0101. Kurmis and Lodhis are the principal cultivating castes; the Lodhis have several fine\nestates, frequently held on quit-rent tenure and locally called *j\u0101girs*. The Gonds number nearly 79,000, or 11\u00bd per cent. of the population. The Bhari\u0101 Bhum\u012b\u0101s (22,000) are another primitive tribe. The Bhumi\u0101 proper is the village priest, charged with the worship of the local deities, and generally receiving a free grant of land from the proprietor. The Bhari\u0101s, on the other hand, have strong thieving propensities, and are sometimes spoken of as a criminal tribe. The identity of the two is uncertain. The Kols, who number about 46,000, or nearly 7 per cent. of the population, live more in the open country than the Gonds, and are employed as farm-servants or on earth-work. Agriculture supports about 62 per cent. of the population.\n\nChristians number 3,688, of whom 2,044 are Europeans and Eurasiacs. The Church Missionary Society and the Zan\u0101na Mission of the Church of England, and others belonging to the Wesleyan, American Methodist, and Roman Catholic Churches, are working in the District; all of these have their head-quarters at Jubbulpore city.\n\nThe best soil of the District is the black alluvial clay (*k\u0101bar*) or loam (*mund*) of the upper Narbad\u0101 valley. The former covers nearly 12 and the latter 26 per cent. of the cultivated area. Sandy rice land formed from crystalline rock covers about 10 per cent., and mixed black and sandy soil, which sometimes produces wheat, nearly 12 per cent. Most of the remaining land is either very shallow blackish soil, or the red and stony land of the hills. About 25 per cent. of the occupied area is generally uncultivated, long resting fallows being required for the shallow stony soil on which light rice and the minor millets are grown. The distinctive feature of agriculture in Jubbulpore is the practice of growing wheat in large embanked fields, in which water is held up during the monsoon season, and run off a fortnight or so before the grain is sown. The advantages of this system are that there is little or no growth of weeds, most of the labour of preparing the land for sowing is saved, and the cultivator is independent of the variable autumn rain, as the fields do not dry up.\n\nWith the exception of 1,094 acres settled on the *ryotw\u0101r\u012b* system, all land is held on the ordinary *m\u0101lguz\u0101r\u012b* tenure. The following table gives the principal statistics of cultivation in 1903-4, areas being in square miles:\n\n| Tahsil     | Total | Cultivated | Irrigated | Cultivable waste | Forests |\n|------------|-------|------------|-----------|------------------|---------|\n| Jubbulpore | 1,519 | 799        | 2         | 412              | 113     |\n| Sihor\u0101     | 1,197 | 563        | 2         | 344              | 96      |\n| Murw\u0101ra    | 1,196 | 607        | 1         | 354              | 137     |\n| **Total**  | **3,912** | **1,969** | **5**     | **1,110**        | **346** |\nWhat waste land remains is situated mainly in the poor and hilly tracts, and does not offer much scope for further extension of cultivation. In the open portion or Haveli, every available acre of land has been taken up, and there are no proper grazing or even standing grounds for cattle. The gross cropped area is about 1,795 square miles, of which 156 square miles are double cropped. Wheat occupies 628 square miles, or 32 per cent. of the cropped area; rice, 193 square miles; kodon and kutki, 316 square miles; gram, 184 square miles; and the oilseed til, 154 square miles. As in other Districts, there has been considerable deterioration in cropping, wheat, which twelve years ago overshadowed all other crops in importance, being supplanted by millets and oilseeds of inferior value. The area sown singly with wheat is only about a third of what it was, while the practice of mixing it with gram has greatly increased in favour. Little cotton is grown in Jubbulpore, and that of a very coarse variety. Betel-vine gardens exist in a number of places, among the principal being the neighbourhood of Jubbulpore city and Bilehri. Fruits and vegetables are also grown to supply the local demand.\n\nCultivation expanded very largely up to 1892; but the famines produced a serious decline, and complete recovery had not been attained in 1903-4. The area sown with two crops has largely increased since 1864. San-hemp is a profitable minor crop which has lately come into favour. During the eleven years ending 1904, Rs. 22,000 was borrowed under the Land Improvement Act, mainly for the embankment of fields, and 4.65 lakhs under the Agriculturists' Loans Act, a third of which was distributed in the famine of 1897.\n\nThe cattle bred in the District are of no special quality. Many animals of the Gwalior and Saugor breeds are imported from outside, being purchased by the local agriculturists at Garhakot fair. The price of cattle is said to have risen largely since the famines of 1897 and 1900, owing to the numbers killed for the export of hides and flesh. The returns show that about 13,000 are slaughtered annually, while in 1896-7 the number amounted to 41,000 out of a total of 490,000 shown in the District returns. Grazing is very scarce in the open embanked wheat lands of the Haveli, and most of the cattle are sent to the forests for grazing during the rains, when the fields do not require ploughing. Buffaloes are bred, and the cows are kept for the manufacture of ghee, while the young bulls are either allowed to die from neglect or sold in Chhattisgarh. Good cow buffaloes are expensive, their price being calculated at Rs. 12 or Rs. 13 for each seer of milk that they give. Ponies are bred to a small extent, and were also formerly imported from Saugor, but very few are purchased there now. Those who can afford it keep a pony for riding, as carts cannot travel over many portions of the District. Ponies, bullocks, and buffaloes are\nalso largely used for pack-carriage. Goats and sheep are kept for food and for the manufacture of ghi.\n\nThe maximum area irrigated is about 6,000 acres, of which 2,500 are under rice, and the remainder devoted to garden crops, sugar-cane, and a little wheat and barley. There are about 2,500 wells and 134 tanks. The embanked wheat-fields, which cover about 310 square miles, are, however, practically irrigated, and the crops grown in them are very seldom affected by deficiency of rainfall.\n\nThe total area of Government forests is 346 square miles, or 9 per cent. of the District area. The forests are scattered in small patches all over the hilly tract east of the railway along the length of the District, while to the west lies one important block in the Murw\u0101ra tahsil, and a few smaller ones. The sal-tree (Shorea robusta) occupies a portion of the Murw\u0101ra forests. The remainder are of the type familiar on the dry hills of Central India\u2014low scrub jungle, usually open and composed of a large variety of species, few of which, however, yield timber or attain large dimensions. Teak is found in places mixed with other species. Among the more important minor products may be mentioned the mahua flower, myrabolams, and honey. The forest revenue in 1903-4 was Rs. 42,000.\n\nIron ores, some of which are very rich, occur in several parts of the District, particularly in the Sihor\u0101 tahsil. The iron is smelted in small furnaces by Agari\u0101s, and sold at Rs. 2\u20138 a maund.\n\nMinerals. Owing to the imperfect methods of refining, however, 50 per cent. is lost in working it up. The iron is of excellent quality, as it is smelted with charcoal, but it is believed that the deposits are not sufficiently large to repay the expenditure of capital on ironworks. Steel is made with manganese by similar methods at Johli in Sihor\u0101, and used locally for agricultural implements. Manganese ores occur at Gosalpur, Sihor\u0101, Khitol\u0101, and other villages, and mining leases have been taken out. Copper ores and argentiferous galena with traces of gold occur at Sleeman\u0101b\u0101d, and a mining lease has been obtained by a barrister of Jubbulpore. The limestone deposits of Murw\u0101ra are worked by a number of capitalists, European and native. The aggregate sales of lime in 1904 were 50,000 tons, valued at nearly 5 lakhs. About 2,500 labourers are employed, principally Kols and Gonds. The largest manufacturers of lime also own a fuller\u2019s earth quarry, the produce of which is sold to paper-mills. Agate pebbles are abundant in the detritus formed by the Deccan trap, and are worked up into various articles of ornament by the local lapidaries. The true or Sulaim\u0101ni onyx is said to be sent to Cambay from Jubbulpore. There are a number of sandstone quarries in or near Murw\u0101ra, from which excellent stone is obtained and exported in the shape of posts and slabs. Chips of limestone marble are exported for the facing of walls.\nCotton hand-weaving was formerly an important industry, but has been reduced by the competition of the mills. The principal centres are Garh\u0101 and Majholi. The coloured s\u0101ris generally worn by women are still woven by hand. The best cloths and carpets are dyed after being woven, \u0101l or Indian madder being used for these heavy cloths, as the foreign dyes change colour and are partly fugitive. Bijer\u0101ghogarh in Murw\u0101ra and Ramkhiri\u0101 and Indr\u0101na in Sihor\u0101 are the principal dyeing centres. Brass and copper vessels are made at Jubbulpore, by both hammering and casting, and cups and ornaments at Pan\u0101gar. Glass bangles and the round glass flasks in which Ganges water is carried are produced at Katangi. At Tewar near the Marble Rocks various kinds of vessels of white sandstone, marble images, agate studs, and other small ornaments are made by the caste of Larhi\u0101s or stone-cutters.\n\nThe Gokuld\u0101s Spinning and Weaving Mills, with 288 looms and 15,264 spindles, produced 10,200 cwt. of yarn and 4,798 cwt. of cloth in 1904. The mills are being enlarged by the addition of 300 looms. Only the coarser counts of yarn are woven, and the produce is sold locally. Large pottery works, started in 1892, turn out roofing and flooring tiles, bricks, and stoneware pipes, which are sold in the local market and also exported. The raw material is obtained from the large deposits of white clay formed from the limestone rocks, and the value of the produce in 1904 was 2 lakhs. A brewery, which was opened in 1897, sends beer to all parts of India. In connexion with the brewery, there is an ice factory which supplies the local demand. All these factories and also a gun-carriage factory and an oil- and flour-mill are situated at Jubbulpore. In Murw\u0101ra eight small flour-mills have been started, being worked by water power and owned by natives; and there are also paint- and oil-mills, worked by water power, in which chocolate-coloured paint is produced from yellow ochre and red oxide of iron. There are six printing presses in the city of Jubbulpore.\n\nWheat and oilseeds are the principal exports. Hemp (s\u0101n) is sent to both Calcutta and Bombay for export to England. Considerable quantities of ghi\u1e6d and forest produce are dispatched from Jubbulpore, but most of this comes from Seoni and Mandl\u0101. Hides and horns, bones, and dried beef are also largely exported. Other exports are the manufactured and mineral products already mentioned. Salt comes principally from the S\u0101mbhar Lake and also from Bombay and Gujar\u0101t, sugar from the Mauritius, and gur (unrefined sugar) from Bih\u0101r. Kerosene oil is now universally used for lighting, vegetable oil being quite unable to compete with it. Cotton cloth is imported from Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d and also from the Ber\u0101r and N\u0101gpur mills, as the local mills cannot weave cloth of any fineness. There is a considerable trade in aniline dyes, and synthetic indigo has begun to find a market within the last\nfew years. Transparent glass bangles are now brought in large numbers from Germany. A European firm, dealing in oilseeds, wheat, and myrabolams, has most of the export trade. The rest of the traffic is managed by Bh\u0101tias from Bombay and Cutch\u012b Muhammadans. M\u0101rw\u0101ris act only as local brokers, and do not export grain by rail. The leading weekly markets are at Pan\u0101gar, Barel\u0101, Shahpur\u0101, P\u0101tan, Katangi, Bilheri, Silond\u012b, and Umari\u0101. Numerous religious fairs are held at the different sacred places on the Narbad\u0101 and elsewhere, but trade is important only at those of Bher\u0101gh\u0101t and Kumbhi.\n\nThe main line of railway from Bombay to Calcutta runs through the centre of the District with a length of 93 miles, and nine stations are situated within its limits, including the three towns of Jubbulpore, Sihor\u0101, and Murw\u0101ra. At Jubbulpore the Great Indian Peninsula Railway meets the East Indian. From Katn\u012b junction the B\u012bna-Katn\u012b connexion of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway branches off to Damoh and Saugor in the west, and a branch of the Bengal-N\u0101gpur Railway leads east to Bil\u0101spur. The S\u0101tpur\u0101 extension of the Bengal-N\u0101gpur Railway, which connects Jubbulpore with Gondi\u0101 station, situated about 80 miles from N\u0101gpur towards Calcutta, has recently been completed.\n\nFrom Jubbulpore a number of metalled roads lead to outlying Districts which, before the opening of the recently constructed railway lines, were important trade and military routes. These are the Jubbulpore-Damoh (63 miles), the Jubbulpore-Seoni (86 miles), and the Jubbulpore-Mandl\u0101 (58 miles) roads. Other roads lead from Jubbulpore to P\u0101tan, Deori, and Dindor\u012b in Mandl\u0101, of which the two latter are partly metalled, while the P\u0101tan road is unmetalled. From the south-west of the District trade goes to Shahpur\u0101 station. The principal roads from Sihor\u0101 are towards P\u0101tan and Majholi, and are unmetalled. A considerable amount of trade comes to Katn\u012b from the Native States to the north, chiefly by roads from Bijer\u0101ghogarh, from Rewah through Barhi, and from Damoh. The communications in the south of the District are excellent, but those in the north are not so advanced, apart from the railways. The total length of metalled roads is 108 miles and of unmetalled roads 301 miles, and the expenditure on maintenance in 1903-4 was Rs. 67,000. More than 200 miles of the more important roads are managed by the Public Works department, and the remainder by the District council. There are avenues of trees on 74 miles.\n\nFailures of crops occurred in Jubbulpore District from excessive winter rain in 1818-9 and from deficiency of rainfall in 1833-4, causing considerable distress. In 1868-9, the year of the Bundelkhand famine, the Murw\u0101ra tahsil was severely affected, and a large decrease of population was shown at the\nfollowing Census. The District then continued prosperous until 1893-4, when for three years in succession the spring crops were spoilt by excessive winter rain. The poorer classes were distressed in 1896, and some relief was necessary, while in the following year Jubbulpore was very severely affected. Nearly 100,000 persons, or 13 per cent. of the population, were in receipt of relief in March, 1897, and the total expenditure was 19 lakhs. After two favourable seasons followed the famine of 1899-1900. The failure of crops in this was, if anything, more extensive than in 1897; but the people were in a better condition to meet it, and owing to the generous administration of relief the effect of the famine was far less marked. The numbers on relief reached 65,000, or nearly 9 per cent. of the population, in July, 1900, and the total expenditure was 9 lakhs. A number of tanks were constructed or repaired by Government agency and some field embankments were made, besides various improvements in communications.\n\nThe Deputy-Commissioner is aided by four Assistant and Extra-Assistant Commissioners. For administrative purposes the District is divided into three tahsils, each of which has a tahsil-d\u0101r, with naib-tahsil-d\u0101rs at Sihora and Murwara. Administration. Jubbulpore is the head-quarters of an Executive Engineer, who is in charge of Jubbulpore, Mandl\u0101, and Seoni Districts, of an Executive Engineer for irrigation, and of a Forest officer.\n\nThe civil judicial staff consists of a District and three Subordinate Judges, a Small Cause Court Judge for Jubbulpore city, and a Munsif for the Jubbulpore tahsil. The Divisional and Sessions Judge of the Jubbulpore Division has jurisdiction in the District. Crime is light, but the District is sometimes visited by professional coiners or dacoits from the neighbouring Native States.\n\nNeither the Gond nor the Mar\u0101th\u0101 government had any fixed principles for the realization of revenue, nor were any rights in land recognized. The policy of the Mar\u0101th\u0101s was directed merely to the extortion of as much money as possible. Rents were commonly collected from the ryots direct, and when farming was practised short leases only were granted on very high rents, which sometimes amounted to more than the village \u2018assets.\u2019 For some years after the cession in 1818 short-term settlements were made, the demand being fixed on the first occasion at 4.18 lakhs, subsequently rising in 1825 to 6.41 lakhs. This assessment proved, however, too heavy, and in 1835 a twenty years\u2019 settlement was made and the revenue fixed at 4.76 lakhs. Under it the District prospered greatly. Revision was postponed for some years owing to the Mutiny; but in 1863 a thirty years\u2019 settlement was concluded, at which the revenue was raised to 5.69 lakhs, including Rs. 60,000 assessed on the subsequently included estate of Bij\u0113raghogarh. During the currency of this settlement, which almost coin-\ncided with the opening of the railway, Jubbulpore enjoyed a period of great agricultural prosperity. Cultivation increased by 35 per cent. and the price of wheat by 239 per cent., while that of other grains doubled. The income of the landholders rose by 61 per cent., mainly owing to large enhancements of the rental. The latest settlement, commenced in 1888 and completed in 1894, raised the revenue to 10 lakhs, an increase of 65 per cent. The new assessment was not excessive, and would have been easily payable; but the successive disastrous seasons, of which mention has been made, necessitated substantial reductions in the demand, and the revenue in 1903-4 had been reduced to Rs. 8,77,000. The average rental incidence per cultivated acre at settlement was Rs. 1-3-8 (maximum Rs. 3-12-1, minimum R. 0-3-1), and the revenue incidence was R. 0-11-11 (maximum Rs. 1-15-3, minimum R. 0-1-7).\n\nThe total receipts from land revenue and from all sources have been, in thousands of rupees:\n\n|                | 1880-1 | 1890-1 | 1900-1 | 1903-4 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Land revenue   | 5,73   | 5,78   | 9,16   | 8,67   |\n| Total revenue  | 11,41  | 12,76  | 14,87  | 15,03  |\n\nLocal affairs outside municipal areas are entrusted to a District council, under which are three local boards, each having jurisdiction over one tahsil. The local boards have no independent income, but perform inspection duty and supervise minor improvements. The income of the District council in 1903-4 was Rs. 87,000. The expenditure was Rs. 84,000, mainly on public works (Rs. 29,000) and education (Rs. 24,000). JUBBULPORE City, SIHORA, and MURWARA are municipalities.\n\nThe police force consists of 751 officers and men, including a special reserve of 55 men, 8 railway police, and 10 mounted constables, under a District Superintendent. There are 1,721 village watchmen for 2,298 inhabited villages. The District has a Central jail, with accommodation for 1,463 prisoners, including 150 female prisoners. The daily average number of male prisoners in 1904 was 777, and of female prisoners 32. Cloth for pillow and mattress cases, net money-bags, wire netting, and Scotch and Kidderminster carpets are made in the Central jail.\n\nIn respect of education Jubbulpore stands second among the Districts of the Province, 5.3 per cent. of the population (10 males and 0.6 females) being able to read and write. Statistics of the number of pupils under instruction are as follows: (1880-1) 8,300, (1890-1) 9,805, (1900-1) 12,070, (1903-4) 14,141, including 1,611 girls. The educational institutions comprise an Arts college in\nJubbulpore city, which also contains law and engineering classes; 3 high schools; 3 training schools for teachers; 6 English and 15 vernacular middle schools; 164 primary schools; and 2 special schools. The total expenditure on education in 1903-4 was Rs. 1,40,000, of which Rs. 16,000 was realized from fees. The percentage of children under instruction to those of school-going age is 14. Jubbulpore city also contains a Reformatory, to which youthful offenders from the whole Province are sent and taught different handicrafts. It had 125 inmates in 1904.\n\nThe District has 14 hospitals and dispensaries, with accommodation for 131 in-patients. In 1904 the number of cases treated was 106,386, of whom 1,585 were in-patients, and 3,422 operations were performed. The expenditure was Rs. 20,000, chiefly from Provincial funds. A lunatic asylum at Jubbulpore contains 178 patients.\n\nVaccination is compulsory in the municipalities of Jubbulpore city (including the cantonment), Sihor\u0101, and Murw\u0101ra. The proportion of successful vaccinations in 1903-4 was 33 per 1,000 of the population.\n\n[Kh\u0101n Bah\u0101dur Aul\u0101d Husain, Settlement Report (1895). A District Gazetteer is being compiled.]\n\n**Jubbulpore Tahsil.**\u2014Southern tahsil of Jubbulpore District, Central Provinces, lying between 22\u00b0 49' and 23\u00b0 32' N. and 79\u00b0 21' and 80\u00b0 36' E., with an area of 1,519 square miles. The population decreased from 361,889 in 1891 to 332,488 in 1901. The density is 219 persons per square mile, which is considerably above the District average. The tahsil contains one town, JUBBULPORE CITY (population, 90,316), the head-quarters of the District and tahsil; and 1,076 inhabited villages. Excluding 113 square miles of Government forest, 63 per cent. of the available area is occupied for cultivation. The cultivated area in 1903-4 was 799 square miles. The demand for land revenue in the same year was Rs. 4,54,000, and for cesses Rs. 51,000. The tahsil contains part of the highly fertile wheat-growing tract known as the Jubbulpore Haveli on the west, some good but uneven land lying east of the railway, and some hill and forest country to the east towards Kundam and Baghr\u0101ji and also on the southern border.\n\n**Jubbulpore City.**\u2014Head-quarters of the Division, District, and tahsil of the same name, Central Provinces, situated in 23\u00b0 10' N. and 79\u00b0 57' E., 616 miles from Bombay by the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, and 784 miles from Calcutta by the East Indian, the two lines meeting here. A branch narrow-gauge railway has recently been opened to Gondi\u0101, 117 miles distant, on the Bengal-N\u0101gpur system. The city stands in a rocky basin surrounded by low hills, about 6 miles from the Narbad\u0101 river. The gorge of the Narbad\u0101 at Bher\u0101gh\u0101t, where the river passes through the well-known MARBLE\nRocks, is 13 miles distant. Jubbulpore is well laid out, with broad and regular streets, and numerous tanks and gardens have been constructed in the environs. Its elevation is 1,306 feet above sea-level. The climate is comparatively cool, and Jubbulpore is generally considered the most desirable of the plain stations in the Central Provinces, of which it ranks as the second city. It is steadily increasing in importance, the population at the last four enumerations having been: (1872) 55,188, (1881) 75,075, (1891) 84,481, and (1901) 90,316. Of the total in 1901, 63,997 were Hindus, 21,036 Muhammadans, and 3,432 Christians, of whom 2,000 were Europeans and Eurasians.\n\nFour miles to the west of the city, and included in the municipality, is Garh\u0101, once the capital of the Gond dynasty of Garh\u0101-Mandl\u0101, whose ancient keep, known as the Madan Mahal, still crowns a low granite range with the old town lying beneath it. This was constructed about 1100 by Madan Singh, and is now in ruins. It is a small building of no architectural pretensions, and its only interest lies in its picturesque position, perched upon the top of the hill on a huge boulder of rock. In the sixteenth century the capital was removed to Mandl\u0101, and the importance of Garh\u0101 declined. Of the history of Jubbulpore itself nothing is known until it was selected by the Mar\u0101th\u0101s as their head-quarters on the annexation of Mandl\u0101 in 1781. In an old inscription now in the N\u0101gpur Museum the name is given as Javalipatna. Jubbulpore subsequently became the head-quarters of the Commissioner of the Saugor and Nerbudda Territories, which were merged in the Central Provinces in 1861.\n\nA municipality was constituted in 1864. The municipal receipts and expenditure during the decade ending 1901 averaged Rs. 2,62,000 and Rs. 2,57,000 respectively. In 1903\u20134 the income was Rs. 3,54,000, the main sources being octroi (Rs. 1,65,000) and water rate (Rs. 29,000); and the total expenditure was Rs. 2,38,000, including refunds (Rs. 56,000), conservancy (Rs. 34,000), repayment of loans (Rs. 28,000), general administration and collection of taxes (Rs. 21,000), and water-supply (Rs. 13,000). Previous to the construction of the existing water-works, the town depended for its supply on a number of unreliable wells, and it was not uncommon for water to be retailed in the hot season at one or two annas a pot. The water-works were opened in 1883, and extended to the cantonment and the civil station in 1894. They consist of a reservoir constructed on the Khand\u0101ri stream, about seven miles from the city. The masonry embankment is 1,680 feet long and 66 feet high, and the catchment area of the reservoir is 54 square miles. Water is conveyed to the city in pipes by gravitation. The total cost of the works was 9.4 lakhs, including the extension. The effect of the constant intake of water in a city whose situation does not provide good natural drainage has, however, been to render\nthe ground somewhat sodden, and a drainage scheme to counteract this tendency is under consideration.\n\nJubbulpore includes a cantonment with a population of 13,157. The receipts and expenditure of the cantonment fund during the decade ending 1901 averaged about Rs. 25,000, and in 1903-4 they amounted to Rs. 32,000. The ordinary garrison has hitherto consisted of one battalion of British and one of Native infantry, a squadron of Native cavalry, and two field batteries; but it is proposed to increase it. There are also two companies of Railway Volunteers, and one of the Nagpur Volunteer Rifles. Jubbulpore is the head-quarters of a general officer, and the garrison is included in the Mhow division. A central gun-carriage factory for India was opened in 1905. A Government grass farm, combined with a military dairy, has also been established.\n\nJubbulpore is an important commercial and industrial town. It receives the grain and other produce of the greater part of Jubbulpore District, and of portions of Seoni and Mandla. The factories include spinning and weaving mills, pottery works, a brewery and ice factory, oil- and flour-mills, the workshops of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, and four hydraulic presses for saw-hemp. The local handi-crafts are cloth-weaving, brass-working, stone-cutting, and the manufacture of images from marble, and of studs, buttons, and other ornaments from agate pebbles. Till lately a considerable tent-making industry was carried on, at first by the Thags, who were kept in confinement here, and their descendants, and afterwards at a Reformatory school; but this has now ceased. There are six printing presses, with English, Hindi, and Urdu type; and an English weekly and a Hindi newspaper are published.\n\nJubbulpore is the head-quarters not only of the ordinary District staff, but of the Commissioner and Divisional Judge of the Jubbulpore Division, a Conservator of Forests, a Superintending and an Irrigation Engineer, the Superintendent of Telegraphs for the Central Provinces, and an Inspector of Schools. One of the three Central jails and one of the two lunatic asylums in the Province are located here. The industries carried on in the Central jail include the weaving of cloth for pillow and mattress cases, and of net money-bags, the manufacture of wire netting for local use, and of thick bedding cloth and Scotch and Kidderminster carpets for sale. Fifty-five looms were employed in making carpets in 1903-4. The Church Missionary Society, the Zanana Mission, and the Roman Catholic, Wesleyan, and American Methodist Churches have mission stations in Jubbulpore, and support several orphanages and schools. A Government Arts college affiliated to the Allahabad University, with law and engineering classes attached to it, had 114 students in 1903-4. There are also three high schools, one maintained by the Church Missionary Society with 79 pupils,\none by a Muhammadan society with 8 pupils, and one by a Hindu society with 87 pupils, training institutions for male and female teachers, and 53 other schools. Schools for European boys and girls are maintained by the Church Missionary Society and the Roman Catholic Mission, with the assistance of Government grants. There is also a Reformatory, to which youthful offenders from the whole Province are sent and taught different handicrafts. It contains 125 inmates, and is the successor of the old school for the children of Thags arrested in the Central Provinces. Jubbulpore contains a general hospital, the Lady Elgin Hospital for women, three dispensaries, and a veterinary dispensary.\n\n**Jubo.**\u2014Town in the State of Khairpur, Sind, Bombay, situated in 26\u00b0 22' N. and 69\u00b0 34' E. Population (1901), 6,924. The inhabitants deal chiefly in goats and sheep; and rough carpets of goat's hair are also manufactured. Jubo contains the ruins of a fort built by the late Mir.\n\n**J\u016bkal.**\u2014'Crown' sub-t\u0101luk of the Atr\u0101f-i-balda District, Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State, lying to the south-west of Niz\u0101m\u0101b\u0101d District, with an area of 87 square miles. Its population in 1901 was 15,789, compared with 10,883 in 1891. The sub-t\u0101luk contains 22 villages, and J\u016bkal (3,350) is the head-quarters. The land revenue in 1901 was Rs. 66,000. The soil is mostly regar or black cotton soil.\n\n**Jullundur Division (J\u0101landhar).**\u2014A Division of the Punjab, stretching from the borders of Tibet on the north-east across the valleys of the Upper Be\u0101s and Sutlej to the borders of the Bikaner desert on the south-west. It lies between 29\u00b0 55' and 32\u00b0 59' N. and 73\u00b0 52' and 78\u00b0 42' E. The Commissioner's head-quarters are at the town of Jullundur. The Division comprises all varieties of scene and soil, from the tumbled masses of the Outer Him\u0101layas, in Kul\u016b and K\u0101ngra, to the fertile plains of Jullundur or the arid tracts of Ferozepore. The population increased from 3,787,945 in 1881 to 4,217,670 in 1891, and to 4,306,662 in 1901. The area is 19,410 square miles, and the density of population 222 persons per square mile, as compared with 209 for the Province as a whole. In 1901 Hindus formed 52 per cent. of the population (2,242,490), while other religions included 1,457,193 Muhammadans, 591,437 Sikhs, 5,562 Jains, 4,176 Buddhists, 33 P\u0101rs\u012bs, and 5,766 Christians (of whom 1,919 were natives). The Division contains five Districts, as shown in the table on the next page.\n\nOf these, K\u0101ngra lies entirely in the hills, sloping away to the sub-montane District of Hoshi\u0101rpur. The rest lie in the plains. The Division contains 6,415 villages and 37 towns, of which the following had in 1901 a population exceeding 20,000: **Jullundur** (67,735), **Ferozepore** (49,341), and **Ludhi\u0101na** (48,649).

The density of the population is 244 persons per square mile. The States contain 1,053 villages and 12 towns, of which Maler Kotla (21,122) alone exceeds 20,000 inhabitants.\n\nLudhiana, Ferozepore, and Jullundur are the only towns of commercial importance, while Kangra and Jawala Mukhi are famous for their religious associations. The Division practically corresponds to the ancient Hindu kingdom of Trigartta. Kangra fort has been many times besieged, while more recent battle-fields are those of Mudki, Ferozeshah, Aliwal, and Sobraon in the first Sikh War (1845).\n\n**Jullundur District (Jalandhar).**\u2014District in the Jullundur Division, Punjab, lying between 30\u00b0 56' and 31\u00b0 37' N. and 75\u00b0 5' and 76\u00b0 16' E., with an area of 1,431 square miles. It occupies the southern part of the doab (called the Bist Jullundur Doab), or country between the Beas and Sutlej. The latter river forms its southern border, separating it from Ludhiana and Ferozepore, and in shape the District is an irregular triangle with its base on that river. The State of Kapurthala separates it on the west from the Beas and its confluence with the Sutlej. Along its north-east border lies the\nDistrict of Hoshi\u0101rpur; and in the centre of this portion, between the Jullundur and Naw\u0101shahr tahsils, is a detached tract of Kap\u016brthala territory which forms the Phagw\u0101ra tahsil of that State. The valley of the Sutlej is marked by a high, well-defined bank.\n\nPhysical aspects. North of this lies a plateau whose highest point, at R\u0101hon near the eastern corner of the District, is 1,012 feet above sea-level. Thence it slopes gradually westwards towards the Be\u0101s. No hill or rock breaks the level of this plateau, which lies entirely within the zone of rich cultivable soil that skirts the foot of the Himalayas, and was regarded by the Sikhs as the garden of the Punjab. At places a few acres are covered with sand; but, except in these rare spots, one vast sheet of luxuriant and diverse vegetation spreads over the plain from end to end. South of the high bank of the Sutlej lies the Bet or kh\u0101dar, a strip of alluvial soil annually fertilized by deposits of silt from that river, although the opening of the Sirhind Canal has greatly reduced its flow, and it now runs almost dry for eight months in the year. The only important stream is the East or White Bein, which, rising east of R\u0101hon and running along the Hoshi\u0101rpur border, traverses the Phagw\u0101ra tahsil of Kap\u016brthala State, and thence meanders westwards across the District till it falls into the Sutlej near its junction with the Be\u0101s. In its earlier course it receives several torrents from the Siw\u0101lik Hills in Hoshi\u0101rpur. These bring down deposits of sand, which are doing considerable damage to the cultivated lands on its eastern bank.\n\nThe District is situated entirely in the alluvium, and contains nothing of geological interest. Cultivation has advanced to such a point that there is little in the way of natural vegetation beyond the weeds that come up with the crops throughout North-west India. Trees are almost always planted; and, owing to the proximity of the Himalayas, several kinds succeed very well, among them the mango and ber (Zizyphus Jujuba). The river banks are in places fringed with a dense growth of high grasses, as in Ferozepore and adjoining Districts.\n\nWolves are seen but very rarely, and towards Kap\u016brthala antelope, n\u012blgai, and hares are found. Field-rats abound, and do no small amount of damage to the crops.\n\nThe climate is, for the plains, temperate. In the hot season, with the exception of June and July, the heat is not excessive; in the cold season frosts are light, and confined to January and February. The average mean temperature of January is $56^\\circ$, and of June $93^\\circ$. The mortality varies very much with the rainfall, owing to the prevalence of malaria in rainy years. Plague made its first appearance in the Punjab in the village of Khatkar Kal\u0101n in this District in 1897.\n\nOwing to the nearness of the hills, the rainfall is fairly constant.\nThe annual average varies from 24 inches at Phillaur to 27 at Jullundur, 22 inches falling in the summer months and only 5 in the winter. During the ten years ending 1903 the heaviest fall was 60 inches at Naw\u0101shahr in 1900-1, and the lightest 11 inches, in 1899-1900, at Jullundur. There were disastrous floods in 1875 and 1878, owing to the railway embankment giving insufficient passage to the floods caused by the unusually heavy rains.\n\nEarly legends attribute the name of the do\u0101b to the Daitya king Jal\u0101ndhara, who was overwhelmed by Siva under a pile of mountains. His mouth, the legend says, was at Jaw\u0101la Mukhi, his feet at Mult\u0101n, where in ancient times the Be\u0101s and Sutlej met, and his back under the upper part of the Jullundur Do\u0101b, including the present District. The earliest mention of Jullundur occurs in the accounts of the Buddhist council held at Kuvana, near that city, early in the Christian era, under the auspices of Kanishka. When visited in the seventh century by Hiuen Tsiang, it was the capital of the R\u0101jput kingdom of Trigartta, which also included the modern Districts of Hoshiarpur and Kangra and the States of Chamba, Mandi, and Suket. Towards the end of the ninth century the R\u0101jar\u0101jar\u0101ngin\u012b records the defeat of Prithw\u012b Chandra, R\u0101j\u0101 of Trigartta, by Sankara Chandra of Kashmir. The town was taken by Ibr\u0101him Sh\u0101h Ghori about 1088; and from that time the country appears to have remained under Muhammadan rule, the Jullundur Do\u0101b being generally attached to the province of Lahore. During the Saiyid dynasty (1414-51), however, the authority of Delhi was but weakly maintained; and the do\u0101b became the scene of numerous insurrectionary movements, and especially of the long campaign of the Khokhar chief Jasrath against the ruling power. Near Jullundur the Mughal forces concentrated in 1555, when Hum\u0101y\u016bn returned to do battle for his kingdom, and the neighbourhood was the scene of Bair\u0101m\u2019s defeat by the imperial forces in 1560. Adina Beg, the last and most famous of the governors of Jullundur, played an important part during the downfall of Muhammadan power in the Punjab, holding the balance between the Delhi emperor, the Sikhs, and Ahmad Sh\u0101h Durr\u0101ni. Both N\u016brmahal and Kart\u0101rpur were sacked by Ahmad Sh\u0101h, and to avenge the desecration of the latter place the Sikhs burnt Jullundur in 1757.\n\nThe Sikh revolt against the Mughal power early found strong support in the District, and a number of petty chieftains rapidly established themselves by force of arms as independent rulers throughout the do\u0101b. In 1766 the town of Jullundur fell into the hands of the Faizullahpura mist, or confederacy, then led by Khushh\u0101l Singh. His son and successor, Budh Singh, built a masonry fort in the town, while several other leaders fortified themselves in its suburbs. Phillaur was seized\nby Budh Singh, who made it the capital of a considerable State; and the Muhammadan R\u0101jputs of Nakodar (on whom the town had been conferred in j\u0101g\u012br during the reign of Jah\u0101ng\u012br) were early ousted by Sard\u0101r T\u0101ra Singh, Ghaiba, who built a fort, and made himself master of the surrounding territory. But meanwhile Ranjit Singh was consolidating his power in the south; Phillaur fell into his hands in 1807, and he converted the sarai into a fort to command the passage of the Sutlej; and in 1811 Diw\u0101n Mohkam Chand was dispatched to annex the Faizullahpuria dominions in the Jullundur Do\u0101b. Budh Singh fled across the Sutlej; and though his troops offered some resistance to the invader, the Mah\u0101r\u0101ja successfully established his authority in the autumn of that year. Thenceforth Jullundur was the capital of the Sikh possessions in the do\u0101b till British annexation. Nakodar was seized in 1816, the petty Sard\u0101rs were gradually ousted from their estates, and the whole country brought under the direct management of the Sikh governors. Here, as elsewhere, their fiscal administration proved very oppressive, especially under Shaikh Ghul\u0101m Muh\u012b-ud-d\u012bn, the last official appointed from the court of Lahore, a tyrannical ruler, who exacted irregular taxes. He made over the tract to his son, Im\u0101m-ud-d\u012bn, but neither resided regularly in the do\u0101b, their charge being entrusted to lieutenants, the best known of whom were Sandhe Kh\u0101n in Hoshiarpur and Kar\u012bm Bakhsh in Jullundur.\n\nAt the close of the first Sikh War the British annexed the whole of the Jullundur Do\u0101b, and it became the Commissionership of the Trans-Sutlej States. For two years the administration was directly under the Supreme Government; but in 1848 the Commissioner became subordinate to the Resident at Lahore, and in the succeeding year, when events forced on the annexation of the Punjab, the administration of the do\u0101b was assimilated to the general system. The Commissioner's head-quarters were fixed at Jullundur, and the three Districts of Jullundur, Hoshiarpur, and Kangra were created. The fort at Phillaur was occupied as an artillery magazine, and cantonments formed there and at Nakodar, which continued to be occupied till 1857 and 1854 respectively.\n\nIn 1857 the native troops stationed at Jullundur and Phillaur mutinied and marched off to join the rebel forces at Delhi; the authorities were, however, not altogether unprepared, and though the mutineers succeeded in escaping unmolested, they were prevented from doing serious damage. R\u0101j\u0101 Randh\u012br Singh of Kap\u016brthala rendered invaluable assistance at this time, both in supplying troops and, by the exercise of his personal influence, in helping to preserve the peace of the do\u0101b.\n\nThe tombs at Nakodar and Nur Jah\u0101n's sarai at N\u016brmahal are the chief remains of antiquarian interest.\nThe population of the District at the last four enumerations was: (1868) 794,418, (1881) 789,555, (1891) 907,583, and (1901) 917,587, dwelling in 10 towns and 1,216 villages. It increased by 1.1 per cent. during the last decade, the increase being greatest in the Jullundur tahsil and least in Phillaur. The density of population is the highest in the Province. The District is divided into the four tahsils of Jullundur, Naw\u0101shahr, Phillaur, and Nakodar, the head-quarters of each being at the place from which it is named. The chief towns are Jullundur, the head-quarters of the District, and the municipalities of Kartarpur, Alawalpur, Phillaur, Nurmahal, Rahon, Nawashahr, Banga, and Nakodar.\n\nThe following table shows the chief statistics of population in 1901:\n\n| Tahsil     | Area in square miles | Number of Towns | Villages | Population | Population per square mile | Percentage of variation in population between 1891 and 1901 | Number of persons able to read and write |\n|------------|----------------------|-----------------|----------|------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Jullundur  | 391                  | 3               | 409      | 305,976    | 782.4                     | + 3.6                                                        | 14,209                                 |\n| Naw\u0101shahr  | 299                  | 3               | 274      | 190,339    | 656.7                     | \u2212 4.5                                                        | 7,820                                  |\n| Phillaur   | 298                  | 3               | 222      | 192,860    | 647.2                     | + 1.7                                                        | 6,285                                  |\n| Nakodar    | 371                  | 1               | 311      | 222,412    | 599.5                     | + 2.5                                                        | 4,789                                  |\n| **District total** | **1,431**          | **10**          | **1,216**| **917,587**| **641.2**                 | **+ 1.1**                                                    | **33,103**                             |\n\n**Note.\u2014** The figures for the areas of tahsils are taken from the revenue returns. The total District area is that given in the Census Report.\n\nMuhammadans number 421,011, or more than 45 per cent. of the total; Hindus, 368,051, or 40 per cent.; and Sikhs, 125,817, or nearly 14 per cent. Punjabi is spoken throughout the District.\n\nBy far the most numerous caste are the Jats or J\u0101ts, who number 185,000, or 20 per cent. of the total, and own half the villages. About 185 clans are enumerated in the District. Some of these claim a Rajput origin; others have no traditions of being anything but Jats. Taken as a whole, they are an honest, industrious, sturdy, and vigorous folk, addicted to no form of serious crime, except female infanticide. The Muhammadan Jats are inferior to the Hindu and Sikh. The Arains (143,000) come next, comprising one-seventh of the total. They are entirely Muhammadans, and are a peaceable people without the sturdy spirit of the Jats, but quite as efficient cultivators. The Rajputs (50,000) come third. More than four-fifths are Muhammadans, but they nearly all preserve Hindu customs. They formerly held a more important position in the District than they do now, and carefully maintain the traditions of their former greatness; and, despising work as beneath their dignity, they are very inferior as agriculturists to the Jats. The Khokhars are entirely Muhammadan.\nthey are often considered Rajputs, but the claim is not generally accepted, and they do not intermarry with Rajputs. The Awans (12,000) also are all Muhammadans. They claim to have come from Arabia, but their observance of Hindu usages marks them as converts to Islam. Other agricultural tribes worthy of mention are Sainis (16,000), who are clever market-gardeners; Kambohs (6,000), mainly Sikhs; and Gujars (20,000), who are found everywhere. The Khattris (26,000) are the most important of the commercial tribes, the Baniyas numbering only 6,000. Of menial tribes the most important are the Chamars (leather-workers, 96,000), Chuhras (scavengers, 41,000), Kumhars (potters, 15,000), Lohars (blacksmiths, 15,000), Mochis (cobblers, 20,000), Tarkhans (carpenters, 32,000, many of whom are landowners), Jhinwars (watermen, 29,000), Julahas (weavers, 16,000), Nais (barbers, 15,000), Chhimbas and Dhobis (washer-men, 12,000), and Telis (oil-pressers, 14,000). Brahmins number 32,000. Half the population is agricultural and one-fourth industrial.\n\nThe Jullundur Mission is one of the stations belonging to the American Presbyterian Board of Foreign Missions. It was established in 1847. In 1901 the District contained 276 native Christians.\n\nLying as Jullundur does close to the Outer Himalayas, an absolute failure of the rains is almost unknown; and apart from the protection afforded by the numerous wells, the soil is sufficiently charged with moisture to resist anything but absolute drought. More than 40 per cent. of the cultivated area is a good alluvial loam; patches of clay soil, amounting in all to 13 per cent. of the cultivated area, are found all over the District, while 24 per cent. is sandy soil, of which half is found in the Jullundur tahsil. A small proportion is uncultivable, being covered by sandhills.\n\nThe District is held almost entirely by communities of peasant proprietors, large estates covering only about 37 square miles.\n\nThe area for which details are available from the revenue records of 1903\u20134 is 1,357 square miles, as shown below:\n\n| Tahsil     | Total | Cultivated | Irrigated | Cultivable waste |\n|------------|-------|------------|-----------|-----------------|\n| Jullundur  | 391   | 337        | 104       | 23              |\n| Nawashahr  | 304   | 217        | 146       | 43              |\n| Phillaur   | 291   | 244        | 111       | 19              |\n| Nakodar    | 371   | 295        | 118       | 25              |\n| **Total**  | **1,357** | **1,093** | **479**   | **110**         |\n\nThe chief crop of the spring harvest is wheat, which occupied 430 square miles in 1903\u20134; gram covered 177 square miles; and barley only 16 square miles. Maize is the staple product of the\nautumn harvest, occupying 149 square miles, while pulses covered 121. Sugar-cane, which occupied 49 square miles, is commercially of the greatest importance to the cultivator, as he looks to this crop to pay the whole or the greater part of the revenue. Very little great millet is grown (14 square miles), and practically no spiked millet; cotton covered 28 square miles, and rice 3,188 acres.\n\nThe cultivated area increased by only 800 acres during the ten years ending 1901, and hardly any further increase can be anticipated. There has, however, been a considerable development of well-sinking, more than 8,000 wells having been constructed since the settlement of 1880-5. Practically no cultivable land is now left untilled; and the pressure on the soil, which in 1901 was, excluding the urban population, 718 persons per cultivated square mile, can only be met by emigration. The District has already sent numbers of its sons to the Chen\u0101b Colony, to the Jamrao Canal in Sind, to Australia and East Africa; and many are in civil or military employment in other parts of India. The remittances of these emigrants add enormously to the natural resources of the District, and the greater portion of the Government revenue collected in it is required by the post offices to enable them to cash money orders issued on them. Loans under the Land Improvement Loans Act for the construction of wells are popular and faithfully applied; during the five years ending 1904 more than Rs. 54,000 was advanced for this purpose. Nothing has been done in the way of improving the quality of the crops grown.\n\nJullundur is not well adapted for breeding cattle, and it is estimated that for ploughing and working the wells no less than 10,000 bullocks per annum have to be imported. These are generally obtained at the Amritsar, Sirsa, and Hiss\u0101r fairs, and from Pati\u0101la and Ferozepore. Although some places in the Jullundur Do\u0101b are mentioned in the Ain-i-Ikbari as famous for a breed of horses, the ponies are not now specially valuable. One horse and four donkey stallions are kept by the District board. There are very few camels, and sheep and goats are not important. The country is so fully cultivated that little ground for grazing is left, except along the Sutlej and in places near the Bein. Large numbers of cattle are driven from a distance to these favoured spots, and considerable sums are levied in grazing fees by the owners of the land.\n\nOf the total area cultivated in 1903-4, 479 square miles, or 44 per cent., were classed as irrigated. Of this area, 477 square miles were irrigated from wells, and 1,455 acres from streams and tanks. In addition, 56 square miles, or 5 per cent., were subject to inundation from the Sutlej. Wells are the mainstay of the District; and there are 28,609 masonry wells worked by cattle, chiefly on the rope-and-bucket system, besides 464 unbricked wells, water-lifts, and lever wells.\nThe Persian wheel is found where the soil is sandy and water near the surface.\n\nThe District contains two small plantations 'reserved' under the Forest Act, consisting chiefly of *shisham* and *kikar*, and covering 262 acres, with a military Reserve of 885 acres. It is on the whole well wooded, almost every one of the wells which it contains being surrounded by a small coppice; but, as already noticed, waste land is very scarce. Phillaur is the winter head-quarters of the Bashahr Forest division, and a great wood mart, to which quantities of timber are floated down the Sutlej and stored. Much also is brought for sale here from the Be\u0101s and the Sirhind Canal.\n\n*Kankar* is plentiful, the best beds being within a radius of ten miles from Jullundur town. Saltpetre is manufactured from saline earth.\n\nA great deal of cotton-weaving is carried on, the principal products being the coarse cotton cloth which supplies most of the dress of the people, and coloured stripes and checks. Large quantities of very coarse cotton fabrics (*khaddar*) are exported to Shik\u0101rpur and Sukkur in Sind. R\u0101hon had once a great reputation for a superior cotton longcloth, but the industry is almost extinct. Silk-weaving is carried on at Jullundur town, and in 1899 employed 250 looms, the estimated out-turn being valued at 2 lakhs. The gold and silver manufactures are flourishing, but in no way remarkable, and the out-turn is insufficient for local requirements. Besides ornaments, silver wire and gold and silver lace are made. The District has some reputation for carpenter's work, and chairs are made at Kart\u0101rpur for the wholesale trade. Brass vessels are manufactured in many parts, the output being valued at Rs. 27,000, of which half is exported. The thin pottery known as 'paper pottery' is made in the District, and glazed and coloured tile-work of unusual excellence is turned out at Jullundur by one man. There are two flour-mills at Jullundur town, and attached to one of them is a small iron and brass foundry. The number of factory employ\u00e9s in 1904 was 73.\n\nThe traffic of the District is mainly in agricultural produce. In ordinary years grain is imported from Ludhi\u0101na, Ferozepore, and the Sikh States for export to the hills: other articles of import are piece-goods from Delhi, Bombay, and Calcutta, iron from Ferozepore, Amritsar, and Kar\u0101chi, brass and copper vessels from Jag\u0101dhri, Amritsar, and Delhi, rice from K\u0101ngra, and salt from the Mayo Mines. Sugar and molasses are largely manufactured to supply the markets of Bikaner, Lahore, the Punjab, and Sind. Wheat, cotton cloth, and silk goods are the other principal exports.\n\nThe District is traversed by the main line of the North-Western Railway, and branch lines are contemplated from Jullundur town to\nKap\u016brthala and Hoshi\u0101rpur. It is exceptionally well provided with roads, the total length of metalled roads being 158 miles and of unmetalled roads 337 miles. The most important of the former are the grand trunk road, which traverses the District parallel with the railway, and the road from Jullundur to Hoshi\u0101rpur; these, with some minor roads, 62 miles in length in all, are under the Public Works department, the rest being under the District board. The Sutlej is navigable only in the rains; there are twelve ferries.\n\nJullundur, thanks to the excellence of its soil and the nearness of the hills, is but little liable to drought. None of the famines that have visited the Punjab since annexation has affected the District at all seriously, and it was classed by the Irrigation Commission of 1903 as secure from famine. The area of crops matured in the famine year 1899\u20131900 amounted to 76 per cent. of the normal.\n\nThe District is in charge of a Deputy-Commissioner, aided by three or four Assistant or Extra-Assistant Commissioners. It is divided into four tahsils, each under a tahsildar assisted by a naib-tahsildar: Jullundur comprises its northern portion, and Naw\u0101shahr, Phillaur, and Nakodar, which lie in that order from east to west, the southern.\n\nThe Deputy-Commissioner as District Magistrate is responsible for criminal justice. Civil judicial work is in charge of a District Judge, and both these officers are subordinate to the Divisional and Sessions Judge of the Jullundur Civil Division, which consists of the District of Jullundur alone. There are six Munsifs, three at head-quarters and one at each outlying tahsil. There are also a Cantonment Magistrate at Jullundur and eight honorary magistrates. The common forms of crime are burglary and theft.\n\nIn the revenue system of Akbar the present District formed part of the Du\u0101ba Bist J\u0101landhar, one of the sark\u0101rs of the Lahore S\u016bbah. The later Mughal emperors soon dropped the cash assessments of R\u0101j\u0101 Todar Mal as unprofitably just, and leased clusters of villages to the highest bidder. Under the Sikh confederacies even this remnant of system disappeared, and the ruler took whatever he could get. Ranjit Singh followed the same principle with a greater show of method, giving large grants of land in j\u0101gir on service tenure, and either leasing the rest to farmers or entrusting the collection of the revenue to k\u0101rd\u0101rs, who paid him as little as they dared. When in 1846 the do\u0101b came into British possession, a summary settlement was made by John Lawrence. The assessment, which amounted to 134 lakhs, worked well, and the total demand of the regular settlement (1846\u201351) was only Rs. 20,000 less. The assessment was again mainly guess-work, the demand of the summary settlement being varied only where circum-\nstances suggested an increase or demanded some relief. A revision carried out between 1880 and 1885 resulted in a demand of 15 lakhs. This has been paid very easily ever since, and the District is prosperous and contented. The rates average Rs. 4\u201310\u20130 (maximum Rs. 5\u20138\u20130, minimum Rs. 3\u201312\u20130) on \u2018wet\u2019 land, and Rs. 1\u20138\u20130 (maximum Rs. 2\u20134\u20130, minimum 12 annas) on \u2018dry\u2019 land. The demand, including cesses, for 1903\u20134 was 17.8 lakhs. The average size of a proprietary holding is 1.8 acres.\n\nThe collections of land revenue alone and of total revenue are shown below, in thousands of rupees:\n\n|                | 1880\u20131 | 1890\u20131 | 1900\u20131 | 1903\u20134 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Land revenue   | 12,24  | 13,82  | 14,22  | 14,05  |\n| Total revenue  | 17,03  | 19,74  | 20,42  | 20,25  |\n\nThe District contains nine municipalities: Jullundur, Kartarpur, Alawalpur, Phillaur, Nurmahal, Rahon, Nawashahr, Banga, and Nakodar. Outside these, local affairs are managed by the District board, which in 1903\u20134 had an income of Rs. 1,55,000. The expenditure was Rs. 1,48,600, public works and education being the principal items.\n\nThe regular police force consists of 453 of all ranks, including 56 cantonment and 78 municipal police. The Superintendent usually has three inspectors under him. The village watchmen number 1,305. There are twelve police stations, two road-posts, and two outposts. The fort at Phillaur was made over in 1891 to the Police Training School and central bureau of the Criminal Identification department. The District jail at head-quarters contains accommodation for 318 prisoners. The chief industries carried on in the jail are the manufacture of paper and lithographic printing.\n\nThe District stands nineteenth among the twenty-eight Districts of the Province in respect of the literacy of its population. In 1901 the proportion of literate persons was 3.6 per cent. (6.4 males and 0.3 females). The number of pupils under instruction was 7,624 in 1880\u20131, 15,102 in 1890\u20131, 13,191 in 1900\u20131, and 13,874 in 1903\u20134. The District possessed in 1903\u20134 a training school, 6 Anglo-vernacular high schools, 4 Anglo-vernacular and 7 vernacular middle schools, and 3 English and 124 vernacular primary schools for boys, and 23 vernacular primary schools for girls. In addition, there were 7 advanced and 262 elementary (private) schools. The number of girls in the public schools was 699, and in the private schools 941. The most important schools are at Jullundur town. The total expenditure on education in 1903\u20134 was 1.1 lakhs, the greater part of which was met by Local and Provincial funds.\nBesides the Jullundur civil hospital, the District has ten outlying dispensaries. At these institutions 154,504 out-patients and 4,247 in-patients were treated in 1904, and 12,883 operations were performed. The expenditure was Rs. 20,000, contributed in nearly equal shares by District and municipal funds. There is a leper asylum at Dakhni.\n\nThe number of successful vaccinations in 1903-4 was 21,801, representing 24 per 1,000 of the population. Vaccination is compulsory in the town of Jullundur.\n\n[H. A. Rose, *District Gazetteer* (in press); W. E. Purser, *Settlement Report* (1892).]\n\n**Jullundur Tahsil** (*Jalandhar*).\u2014Northern tahsil of Jullundur District, Punjab, lying between 31\u00b0 12' and 31\u00b0 37' N. and 75\u00b0 26' and 75\u00b0 49' E., with an area of 391 square miles. The population in 1901 was 305,976, compared with 295,301 in 1891. The head-quarters are at the town of Jullundur (population, 67,735); and it also contains the towns of Kartarpur (10,840) and Alawalpur (4,423), with 409 villages. The land revenue and cesses in 1903-4 amounted to 4.8 lakhs. The greater part of the tahsil consists of an upland plateau, with a light soil and frequent sand-hillocks, but along the north-eastern border is a belt of extremely fertile land averaging about 6 miles in width.\n\n**Jullundur Town** (*Jalandhar*).\u2014Head-quarters of the Division and District of Jullundur, Punjab, situated in 31\u00b0 20' N. and 75\u00b0 35' E., on the North-Western Railway and grand trunk road. It is distant by rail from Calcutta 1,180 miles, from Bombay 1,247 miles, and from Karachi 916 miles. Population (1901), including cantonments, 67,735, of whom 24,715 were Hindus, 40,081 Muhammadans, 901 Sikhs, and 1,543 Christians. Jullundur was, when visited by Hiuen Tsiang, a large city, 2 miles in circuit, the capital of a Rajput kingdom. It was taken by Ibrah\u00eem Sh\u00e2h of Ghor about 1088. Under the Mughals Jullundur was the capital of a sarkar; it was burnt by the Sikhs in 1757, and captured by the Faizullahpuria confederacy in 1766. Ranjit Singh annexed it in 1811, and in 1846 Jullundur became the head-quarters of the territory acquired by the British after the first Sikh War. The town is surrounded by several suburbs known as bastis, the most important of which are Basti Danishmandan (population, 2,770) and Basti Shaikh Darwesh (7,109), founded by Ansari Shaikhs from Kani-guram in the seventeenth century. The town contains two flour-mills, to one of which is attached a small iron and brass foundry. The number of hands employed in 1904 was 73. Silk is also manufactured, and good carpenter's work is turned out. The municipality was created in 1867. The income during the ten years ending 1902-3 averaged Rs. 70,600, and the expenditure Rs. 68,800. In 1903-4 the income amounted to Rs. 84,300, chiefly from octroi; and the expenditure to Rs. 86,900, the main items being public health (Rs. 32,300) and\nadministration (Rs. 28,600). The chief educational institutions are four Anglo-veracular high schools, maintained by the municipality, the Presbyterian Mission, and the two rival branches of the Arya Sam\u0101j. There is also a civil hospital.\n\nThe cantonment, established in 1846, lies 4 miles to the south-east of the town. Population (1901), 13,280. The garrison usually consists of two batteries of field artillery, one battalion of British infantry, one regiment of Native cavalry, and a battalion of Native infantry, with a regimental d\u00e9p\u00f4t. The income and expenditure from cantonment funds during the ten years ending 1902-3 averaged Rs. 49,000 and Rs. 41,000 respectively. There is an aided Anglo-veracular high school.\n\n**Jumkha.**\u2014Petty State in Rew\u0101 K\u0101nth\u0101, Bombay.\n\n**Jummoo.**\u2014Province and town in Kashmir State.

Rising in the Tehri State (31\u00b0 1' N., 78\u00b0 27' E.), eight miles west of the lofty mountain Bandarp\u016bnch (20,731 feet), it flows past the sacred shrine of Jamnotr\u012b, and winds through the Outer Him\u0101layas for 80 miles, receiving a few small streams. At the point where it passes into the D\u016bn, the valley between the Him\u0101layas and the Siw\u0101liks, it receives the Tons, which is there the larger stream. Its course now runs southwest for 22 miles, dividing the Kiarda D\u016bn (Punjab) from Dehra D\u016bn (United Provinces); two large affluents, the Giri from Sirmur on the west and the Asan from Dehra on the east, join it here. The Jumna pierces the Siw\u0101liks 95 miles from its source, at Kh\u0101r\u0101, and divides Amb\u0101la and Karn\u0101l Districts in the Punjab from Sah\u0101ranpur and Muzaffarnagar in the United Provinces. It is a large river at Faiz\u0101b\u0101d, where it gives off the Western and Eastern Jumna Canals. Near Bidhaul\u012b in Muzaffarnagar it turns due south, and runs in that direction for 80 miles, dividing Meerut District from the Punjab, till it reaches Delhi. Ten miles below Delhi it gives off the Agra Canal from its western bank at Okhla. It then turns south-east for 27 miles to Dankaur, when it again resumes a southerly course. In this portion it receives on the east the Kotha Nadi and the Hindan, and on the west the Sabi Nadi. Below Delhi the river forms the boundary between Gurgaon District in the Punjab and Bulandshahr and Aligarh Districts in the United Provinces. It then enters Muttra and, crossing it, turns east till the borders of Agra are reached. Throughout its course in this District, where it receives the B\u0101ngang\u0101, and also in Et\u0101wah, it winds in a remarkable manner, its bed lying between high banks which are furrowed by steep ravines. Just before J\u0101laun District is reached the great river Chambal from R\u0101jput\u0101na joins it; and the Jumna then divides the three Districts of Cawnpore, Fatehpur, and Allah\u0101b\u0101d from\nJ\u0101laun, Ham\u012brpur, and B\u0101nd\u0101. In Cawnpore District the Sengar, and in Fatehpur the Non and Rind, flow into it; close to Hamirpur it receives the Betw\u0101, and in B\u0101nd\u0101 District the Ken. It finally falls into the Ganges below Allah\u0101b\u0101d, 860 miles from its source.\n\nThe Jumna, after issuing from the hills, has a longer course in the United Provinces than the Ganges; but it is not so large or important a river, and does not carry as much water as is required by the canals taken from it. The supply is therefore increased from the Ganges by means of the cut into the Hindan; and the Irrigation Commission (1901) recently proposed to make more water from the Ganges available by increasing the supply of the Lower Ganges Canal through a cut from the S\u0101rd\u0101. The Jumna supplies drinking-water to the cities of Agra and Allah\u0101b\u0101d, which possesses, when fresh, special virtue in destroying the enteric microbe. It is crossed by railway bridges near Sars\u0101w\u0101 in Sah\u0101ranpur, at Delhi, Muttra, Agra, Kalpi (2,626 feet in width), and Allah\u0101b\u0101d (3,230 feet). The breadth of water-surface in the dry season varies from 2,600 feet at Okhla and 1,500 feet at K\u0101lpi to 2,200 feet at Allah\u0101b\u0101d. The discharge in flood at Okhla is about 41,000 cubic feet per second, but this dwindles away to less than 200 in the dry season. The Jumna drains a total area of about 118,000 square miles.\n\nThe traffic on the Jumna was formerly of some importance, and large sums were spent in clearing away reefs of kankar (nodular limestone) and conglomerate in Etawah District. Before the opening of the East Indian Railway, much cotton grown in Bundelkhand was sent down the river from K\u0101lpi. At present timber is carried down the upper portion, and stone and grain in the lower courses. The principal towns on or near its bank are: Delhi in the Punjab; and B\u0101ghpat, M\u0101t, Brind\u0101ban, Muttra, Mah\u0101ban, Agra, F\u012broz\u0101b\u0101d, Batesar, Etawah, K\u0101lpi, Hamirpur, and Allah\u0101b\u0101d in the United Provinces.\n\n**Jumna Canal, Eastern.**\u2014An important irrigation work in the Upper Do\u0101b of the United Provinces, taking off from the left or eastern bank of the Jumna. The canal is drawn from a branch of the river which divides soon after piercing the Siwaliks. The bed at this point has a rapid slope over boulders and shingle, and the supply is easily maintained by spurs. For some miles the canal itself flows over a similar bed. The main channel is 129 miles long, and there are 729 miles of distributaries and 447 of drains. Immediately after the British occupation of the Do\u0101b, recurring famines pointed to the urgent necessity for irrigation, and surveys commenced in 1809, but work was not begun till 1823. Funds were limited, and the canal was first opened in January, 1830. Sir Proby Cautley\u2019s experience on this canal was of great assistance in carrying out the magnificent works of the more important Upper Ganges Canal. The line followed kept closely to that of an old canal of the seventeenth century. It has been\nmuch improved since it was opened, by providing falls (which also supply power for flour-mills) to lessen the slope, and by straightening the channel.\n\nThe capital cost at the end of 1830-1 amounted to little more than 4 lakhs, which had increased to 46 lakhs by the end of 1903-4. The canal serves a rich tract in the Districts of Saharanpur, Muzaffarnagar, and Meerut, lying between the Hindan and Jumna, and falls into the latter river a little below Delhi. It commands an area of 906,000 acres, and in 1903-4 irrigated 305,000 acres. The gross revenue has exceeded working expenses in every year except during the Mutiny; and the net profits are usually high, amounting to 9-9 lakhs or 22 per cent. on the capital outlay in 1903-4, while the gross profits were 14-5 lakhs. Since 1837-8 the canal has not been used for navigation.\n\n**Jumna Canal, Western.**\u2014An important perennial irrigation work in the Punjab, taking off from the west bank of the Jumna, and irrigating Ambala, Karnal, Hissar, Rohtak, and Delhi Districts, and parts of the Native States of Patiala and Jind. It is by far the oldest of the great canals in the Province, and originated in 1356, when Firoz Shah III utilized the torrent-bed now known as the Chautang to conduct water to the royal gardens at Hissar and Hansi. This was little more than a monsoon supply-channel, and after about a hundred years water ceased to flow farther than the lands of Kaithal. In 1568 the emperor Akbar re-excavated the work of Firoz Shah, and brought a supply from the Jumna and the Somb into the Chautang, and so on to Hansi and Hissar. This was undoubtedly a perennial canal, as is testified by the ancient bridges at Karnal and Safidon, and the complete set of watercourses with which the canal was provided, besides the original sanad or working-plan of the canal which is still in existence and promises a supply of water all the year round. A yet more ambitious scheme was undertaken in 1626 by Ali Mardan Khan, the engineer of the emperor Shah Jah\u0101n. The river supply in the western branch of the Jumna was dammed up annually about 14 miles below the present head-works of the canal, and the water led along the drainage line at the foot of the high land through Panipat and Sonepat to Delhi. Drainages and escapes were fairly well provided for; and the Pulchaddar aqueduct, which took the canal across the Najafgarh jhil drain near Delhi, was, for the time, a great engineering feat, and was retained, with slight modifications, when the branch was reopened in 1819. The net revenue from the canal was reckoned equal to the maintenance of 12,000 horse. With the decay of the Delhi empire the upkeep of the canal was no longer attended to: water ceased to reach Hansi and Hissar in 1707, the flow on Firoz Shah's line at Safidon stopped in 1720, and the Delhi branch ceased to flow in 1753-60. The Delhi branch was reopened in 1819, and the Hansi branch in 1825. The alignment of the canal was, however, by no means satisfactory: and as early as 1846 it was noticed\nthat the concentrated irrigation, the defective drainage, and the high banks which cut off the flow of the natural drainage of the country, all contributed to rapid deterioration of the soil and decline in health of the people. Saline efflorescence was rapidly spreading, and the inhabitants of the waterlogged area were affected with chronic disorders of the liver and spleen. Between 1870 and 1882 various remodelling schemes were sanctioned, with the object of securing increased control over the supply and its distribution, greater facilities for navigation, and improved drainage; and these have resulted in the complete disappearance of the swamps and accumulations of water, and a most marked improvement in the health of the people. The Sirsa branch was sanctioned in 1888, and this and subsequent minor extensions have largely increased the irrigating capacity of the canal. No less than 200,000 acres were rendered secure in 1896\u20137 by the Sirsa branch alone.\n\nThe head of the canal is at Tajew\u0101la in Amb\u0101la District, in $30^\\circ 17' N.$ and $77^\\circ 37' E.$, about $1\\frac{1}{2}$ miles from the point where the river emerges from the lower hills. The river is here crossed by a weir 1,700 feet in length, flanked at each end by a scouring sluice and head regulator for the Eastern Jumna Canal on the left bank and for the Western Jumna Canal on the right, the full capacities authorized being respectively 1,300 and 6,380 cubic feet per second. The Western Jumna Canal has thus a maximum discharge more than three times that of the average flow of the Thames at Teddington. For the first 14 miles of its course the canal runs almost entirely in the old west branch of the Jumna river. It then effects a junction with the Somb river, a masonry dam across which holds up the combined streams and forces them into the canal head at D\u0101d\u016bpur, which is provided with a regulator and a rapid a short distance below. After a farther course of about 38 miles, chiefly in natural channels, there is at Indri a regulator with a lock and escape head, where the canal divides into the Sirsa branch and the new main line. The Sirsa branch has a capacity of 2,000 cubic feet per second, and runs for 115 miles, watering the arid tract of country between Indri and Sirsa. Some 31 miles farther on, the main line bifurcates into the H\u0101nsi and new Delhi branches. The H\u0101nsi branch has a length of .47 miles and a discharge of nearly 2,000 cubic feet per second, and gives off the B\u016bt\u0101na branch with a capacity of 700 cubic feet per second. The new Delhi branch has a capacity of 1,750 cubic feet per second and a length of 74 miles to the point where it meets the Okhla navigation canal at Delhi. The total length of main canal and branches is 343 miles, of distributaries (major and minor) 1,797 miles, of drainage cuts 657 miles, of escapes 76 miles, and of mill channels 9 miles. The total area commanded by the canal is 4,000 square miles, of which 3,300 square miles are cultivable. The average\narea of crops irrigated during the twenty years ending 1894\u20135 was 529 square miles, which rose in the four years ending 1903\u20134 to an average of 944 square miles; and the work is estimated to irrigate altogether 1,259 square miles. The capital outlay to the end of March, 1904 (excluding a contribution of 11\u00bd lakhs from the Patiala State), was 172\u00b77 lakhs. The gross revenue for the three years ending March, 1904, averaged 23 lakhs, and the net revenue, after paying all interest charges and working expenses, 7\u00b76 lakhs, or 4\u00b74 per cent. on the capital outlay. The main line and the new Delhi branch are navigable from the head-works to Delhi. The Hansi branch is navigable to where it meets the Southern Punjab Railway at Hansi. The expenditure on the provision for navigation is estimated at 16 lakhs; and, although near Delhi there is a certain amount of boat traffic, and timber is largely rafted down the canal, this large expenditure has proved hitherto a financial loss, and the combination of navigation with irrigation a failure. There are flour-mills at several of the falls; but the flour and the other mills at Delhi, which at one time were worked advantageously, are now closed, the water being too valuable to be used for this purpose.\n\n**Junagarh State.**\u2014Native State in the Kathiawar Political Agency, Bombay, lying between 20\u00b0 44\u2032 and 21\u00b0 53\u2032 N. and 70\u00b0 and 72\u00b0 E., with an area of 3,284 square miles. It is bounded on the north by Barda and Hal\u0101r, on the east by Gohelw\u0101r, and on the west and south by the Arabian Sea. The only elevation rising above the general level of the plains is the Girn\u0101r group of hills, the highest peak of which, Gorakhn\u0101th, is about 3,666 feet above sea-level. All the hills are volcanic and consist of trap and basalt, but the summit of the Girn\u0101r is composed of syenite. The principal rivers are the Bh\u0101dar and the Saraswat\u012b. The Bh\u0101dar is the largest river in the State, and much irrigation is carried on along its banks and those of its tributaries. The Saraswat\u012b, or sacred river of Prabh\u0101s P\u0101tan, is famous in the sacred annals of the Hindus. There is also a densely wooded tract called the Gir, hilly in some parts, but in others so low as to be liable to floods during the rainy season. The climate is fairly healthy; but, except on the Girn\u0101r hill, the heat is excessive from the beginning of April to the middle of July. The annual rainfall averages 40 to 50 inches.\n\nUntil 1472, when it was conquered by Sult\u0101n Mahm\u016bd Begara of Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d, Junagarh was a R\u0101jput State, ruled by chiefs of the Chud\u0101sama tribe. During the reign of the emperor Akbar it became a dependency of Delhi, under the immediate authority of the Mughal viceroy of Gujar\u0101t. About 1735, when the representative of the Mughals had lost his authority in Gujar\u0101t, Sher Kh\u0101n B\u0101bi, a soldier of fortune, expelled the Mughal governor, and established his own\nrule. Sher Kh\u0101n's son Sal\u0101bat Kh\u0101n appointed his heir chief of Jun\u0101garh, assigning to his younger sons the lands of B\u0101ntwa. The ruler of Jun\u0101garh first entered into engagements with the British Government in 1807. The chief bears the title of Naw\u0101b, and is entitled to a salute of 11 guns. The present chief is tenth in succession from Sher Kh\u0101n B\u0101bi, the founder of the family. He holds a sanad guaranteeing any succession according to Muhammadan law, and the succession follows the rule of primogeniture. He was created a K.C.S.I. in 1899.\n\nThe population at the last four enumerations was: (1872) 380,921, (1881) 387,499, (1891) 484,190, and (1701) 395,428, dwelling in 7 towns and 811 villages. The decrease in the last decade (19 per cent.) was due to the famine of 1899-1900. Distributed according to religion, the population includes 301,773 Hindus, 85,684 Muhammadans, and 7,842 Jains. The capital is Jun\u0101garh Town. Places of interest include the sacred mountain of Girnar, crowned with Jain temples; the port of Ver\u0101val; and the ruined temple of Somn\u0101th.\n\nThe soil is generally black, with scattered tracts of the lighter kind. Irrigation is mainly from wells worked with the Persian wheel and the leathern bag. In 1903-4 the area of cultivated land was 859 square miles, of which 108 square miles were irrigated. Four stallions are maintained for horse breeding. Agricultural products comprise cotton, shipped in considerable quantities from the port of Ver\u0101val to Bombay, wheat, the ordinary varieties of pulse and millet, oilseeds, and sugar-cane, of both the indigenous and Mauritius varieties. The Gir district contains about 1,200 square miles of good forest. The principal trees are teak, black-wood, jambu, and bab\u016bl, all of which are used for building purposes locally and are a source of revenue to the State. The forest, however, is not able to meet all the demands for building timber of the whole peninsula, as large quantities are imported by sea from the Malabar coast. Stone of good quality is obtainable for building.\n\nThe coast-line is well supplied with fair-weather harbours, suited for native craft, the chief being Ver\u0101val, Naw\u0101bandar, Sutr\u0101p\u0101ra, and M\u0101ngrol. These ports supply grain, timber, and other necessaries to the greater part of Sorath. The State has its own postal arrangements. The Bhaynagar-Gondal-Jun\u0101garh-Porbandar Railway passes through the territory. The main roads are from Jun\u0101garh town towards Jetpur and Dhor\u0101j\u012b, and from Jun\u0101garh to Ver\u0101val. The ordinary country tracks serve in the fair season for the passage of carts, pack-bullocks, and horses. Oil and coarse cotton cloth are the principal manufactures.\n\nJun\u0101garh ranks as a first-class State in K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r. The chief has power of life and death over his own people, the trial of British subjects\nfor capital offences requiring the previous permission of the Agent to the Governor. Though himself paying a tribute of Rs. 65,604 to the Gaikw\u0101r of Baroda and to the British Government, the Naw\u0101b of Jun\u0101garh receives contributions called zortalbi, amounting to Rs. 92,421, from a large number of chiefs in K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r. This levy, which is collected and paid to the Naw\u0101b by British officers of the K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r Agency, is a relic of the days of Muhammadan supremacy.\n\nThe gross revenue in 1903\u20134 was about 26\u00bc lakhs, chiefly derived from land (19 lakhs). Jun\u0101garh has a mint issuing coin which is current only in the State. The British rupee is also current. Revenue survey operations are in progress in the State, the total area surveyed up to 1904 being 2,612 square miles. The chief has entered into engagements to prohibit sat\u012b, and to exempt from duty vessels entering his ports through stress of weather. Of the eighteen municipalities, the largest is Jun\u0101garh, with an income of about Rs. 18,000. The State maintains a military force of 161 men; of these 99 are Imperial Service Lancers, and the remaining 62 are also mounted men. The total strength of the police is 1,760 men, of whom 144 are mounted. There are 9 jails, with a daily average of 51 prisoners in 1903\u20134. Besides one Arts College attended by 181 students, the State contains one high school, and 124 other schools, with 8,800 pupils. The State maintains 21 medical institutions, including one hospital, which afforded relief to 121,000 persons in 1903\u20134. There is also a leper asylum containing 61 inmates. In the same year nearly 10,000 persons were vaccinated.\n\nJun\u0101garh Town.\u2014Capital of the State of the same name in K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r, Bombay, situated in 21\u00b0 31' N. and 70\u00b0 36' E., 60 miles south-west of R\u0101jkot. Population (1901), 34,251, including 17,248 Hindus, 15,911 Musalm\u0101ns, and 1,029 Jains. Jun\u0101garh, situated under the Girm\u0101r and D\u0101t\u0101r hills, is one of the most picturesque towns in India, while in antiquity and historical interest it yields to none. The Uparkot or old citadel contains interesting Buddhist caves, and the whole of the ditch and neighbourhood is honeycombed with caves or their remains. The most interesting of these, called Kh\u0101pr\u0101kodia, have the appearance of having been once a monastery two or three storeys in height. Dr. Burgess, in his Antiquities of Cutch and K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r, has fully described these caves. The ditch is cut entirely out of the rock and forms a strong defence. In the Uparkot are two v\u0101rs or wells said to have been built by slave girls of Chud\u0101sama rulers in olden times; a mosque built by Sult\u0101n Mahm\u016bd B\u0113gara; near the mosque is a cannon 17 feet long, 7\u00bd feet in circumference at the breech, and 9\u00bd inches in diameter at the muzzle; another large cannon in the southern portion of the fort is 13 feet long and has a muzzle 14 inches in diameter. From the times of the Anhilv\u0101da\nkings the Uparkot has been many times besieged, and often taken, on which occasions the R\u0101j\u0101 was wont to flee to the fort on Girn\u0101r, which from its inaccessibility was almost impregnable. Of late years several public buildings have been erected, and the town has been much improved by fine houses built by the nobles of the court. Among the public buildings may be mentioned a fine hospital, the Bah\u0101-ud-d\u012bn Arts College, a library and museum, the Reay Gate with a clock-tower, and a fine high school. A collection of shops called the Mah\u0101bat Circle is in front of the Naw\u0101b's palace. Uparkot is the ancient Jun\u0101garh; the present town is more correctly called Mustaf\u0101b\u0101d, and was built by Mahm\u016bd Begara of Gujar\u0101t.\n\nJun\u0101p\u0101dar.\u2014Petty State in K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r, Bombay.\n\nJungle Mah\u0101ls.\u2014A vague term applied in the eighteenth century to the British possessions and semi-independent chiefdoms in Bengal, lying between the regular Districts of B\u012brbh\u016bm, Burdw\u0101n, and B\u0101nkur\u0101, and the hill country of Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur. As the administration became more precise, inconvenience arose from the vagueness of the jurisdiction; and by Regulation XVIII of 1805 the Jungle Mah\u0101ls were constituted into a distinctly defined District, consisting of 15 parganas or mah\u0101ls from B\u012brbh\u016bm District, 3 from Burdw\u0101n (including the greater part of Bishnupur), and 5 from Midnapore (including M\u0101nbh\u016bm and Bar\u0101bh\u016bm). The separate District of the Jungle Mah\u0101ls was abolished by Regulation XIII of 1833, and the territory redistributed among the adjoining Districts. The tract is now comprised within B\u012brbh\u016bm, the Sant\u0101l Parganas, B\u0101nkur\u0101, Midnapore, and the eastern Districts of the Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur Division, especially M\u0101nbh\u016bm.\n\nJunnar T\u0101luka.\u2014T\u0101luka of Poona District, Bombay, lying between 18\u00b0 59' and 19\u00b0 24' N. and 73\u00b0 38' and 74\u00b0 19' E., with an area of 591 square miles. It contains one town, Junnar (population, 9,675), the head-quarters, and 158 villages, including Otur (6,392). The population in 1901 was 117,753, compared with 115,762 in 1891. The density, 199 persons per square mile, is above the District average. The demand for land revenue in 1903\u20134 was 2 lakhs, and for cesses Rs. 14,000. The chief range is that of Harischandragarh. Junnar consists chiefly of the two valleys of the Mina and the Kukdi. A small portion in the west is composed of high hills and rugged valleys. In the east the soil is either black, of variable depth, or a poor gravel. Bijra is the staple crop. The climate is dry and healthy, and free from hot winds. The annual rainfall averages 30 inches.\n\nJunnar Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the t\u0101luka of the same name in Poona District, Bombay, situated in 19\u00b0 12' N. and 73\u00b0 53' E., 56 miles north of Poona city, and about 16 miles east of the crest of the Western Gh\u0101ts. Population (1901), 9,675. The fort of Junnar, often noticed in Mar\u0101th\u0101 annals, was built by Malik-ut-Tuj\u0101r in 1436.\nIn May, 1657, Sivaji surprised and plundered the town, carrying off about 10 lakhs in specie, besides other valuable spoil. About 1\u00bd miles south-west of the town is the hill fort of Shivner, granted in 1599 to the grandfather of Sivaji; the latter is said to have been born here in 1627. During the turbulent times of Mar\u0101th\u0101 warfare Shivner was often taken and retaken, and once, in 1670, the forces of Sivaj\u012b himself were beaten back by its Mughal garrison. Besides fine gates and solid fortifications, it is celebrated for its deep springs. They rise in pools of great depth, supposed to be coeval with the series of Buddhist caves which pierce the lower portion of the scarp. The chief buildings of interest in Junnar are the J\u0101ma Masjid, five hundred years old, a mosque dating from the time of Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n, the Afiz B\u0101gh, and two fine dargahs. The hills surrounding the plain of Junnar are honeycombed with Buddhist caves, many of them of striking interest. Chief of these is a circular cave situated in a hill beyond Shivner. Some bear traces of fine carving, and there are a few inscriptions dating back to the first century of the Christian era. Junnar is supposed to have been a town of great importance in the days of the Western Kshatrapas. (See Bombay Presidency, History.) The municipality, which was established in 1861, had an average income during the decade ending 1901 of Rs. 8,800. In 1903-4 the income was Rs. 13,000, chiefly derived from octroi and a tax on houses and lands. Though fallen in size and importance since the time of Muhammadan rule, and by the subsequent transfer of the seat of government to Poona under the Mar\u0101th\u0101s, Junnar is still a place of considerable note. It is the chief market of the northern part of the District, and a d\u00e9p\u00f4t for the grain and merchandise passing to the Konkan by the N\u0101na gh\u0101t. It has a high school and nine other schools, attended by 824 boys and 152 girls, a dispensary, and a Subordinate Judge's court. It was formerly celebrated for the manufacture of paper, but the low rates at which the European article is now sold have almost driven native paper out of the market. A branch of the Church Missionary Society is stationed here.\n\nJutogh.\u2014Hill cantonment in Simla District, Punjab, situated in 31\u00b0 7' N. and 77\u00b0 7' E., about a mile from the western extremity of the station of Simla. The land was acquired from Pati\u0101la in 1843. During the summer months one battery of British mountain artillery and two companies of the regiment quartered at Sab\u0101thu are stationed here. Population (March, 1901), 375.\n\nKabb\u0101ldurga.\u2014Fortified conical hill in the Malavalli t\u0101luk of Mysore District, Mysore, situated in 12\u00b0 30' N. and 77\u00b0 18' E., 3,507 feet high. The sides are very precipitous, and the summit is accessible only on one side, where some notches are cut in the solid rock. It was a penal settlement for state prisoners under the Hindu and Musal-\nm\u0101n dynasties. The poisonous water and noxious climate, aided by unwholesome food, soon ended the lives of the victims confined in it. The unfortunate Ch\u0101ma R\u0101j\u0101 and his wife were sent here by the Dalav\u0101yi Devar\u0101j in 1734, and Mor\u0101ri Rao, the Mar\u0101th\u0101 chief of Gooty, by Haidar Ali, who gave the place the name of J\u0101far\u0101b\u0101d. In 1864 the guns were destroyed and the guards removed.\n\n**Kabbani** (also called Kapini or Kapila).\u2014An important tributary of the Cauvery. It rises on the Western Gh\u0101ts in North Wynnaad, and enters Mysore at the south-west corner of Mysore District. Running north-east with a very winding course through the Heggadadevankote t\u0101luk to near Belat\u016br, it there turns east, and receiving the Nugu and (at Nanjang\u016bd) the Gundal, both from the south, joins the Cauvery at Tirumak\u016bdal Narasipur, the confluence being esteemed a spot of great sanctity. The Kabbani is a fine perennial river, 150 to 200 yards wide, and has a total course of about 150 miles, of which 120 are in Mysore. The R\u0101mpur channel, 32 miles long, drawn from it, irrigates nearly 1,400 acres.\n\n**Kab\u012brw\u0101la.**\u2014Northernmost tahsil of Mult\u0101n District, Punjab, lying between 30\u00b0 5' and 30\u00b0 45' N. and 71\u00b0 35' and 72\u00b0 36' E., with an area of 1,603 square miles. The population in 1901 was 130,507, compared with 113,412 in 1891. It contains the town of Talamba (population, 2,526) and 320 villages, including Kab\u012brw\u0101la, the head-quarters. The land revenue and cesses in 1903\u20134 amounted to 5\u00b72 lakhs. The R\u0101vi runs through the northern portion of the tahsil to its junction with the Chen\u0101b in the north-west corner. The north and west portions are irrigated by the Sidhnai Canal, while the south consists of uncultivated B\u0101r jungle.\n\n**K\u0101bul Province.**\u2014The central and most important province of Afghanistan, bounded on the north by Afgh\u0101n-Turkist\u0101n, on the east by the district of Jal\u0101l\u0101b\u0101d, and on the south and west by the provinces of Kandah\u0101r and Her\u0101t. The general elevation is probably not less than 7,000 feet, while a considerable portion of the province consists of a region of lofty mountains. It is crossed in the north by the Hindu Kush. The Band-i-B\u0101ba and the Paghm\u0101n form a great watershed in its centre, dividing the upper reaches of the K\u0101bul, Helmand, and Hari R\u016bd rivers. The lofty highlands of the Haz\u0101raj\u0101t form its south-western districts, and in the south and south-east are the uplands of Ghazni.\n\nThe northern districts of the province are Kohist\u0101n, Panjsh\u012br, B\u0101mi\u0101n, Saigh\u0101n, and Nijr\u0101o. These are peopled by Kohist\u0101nis and T\u0101jiks, while in B\u0101mi\u0101n Haz\u0101ras are also numerous. Its western and south-western districts are those of the Haz\u0101raj\u0101t, including the country of the Bes\u016bd, the Deh Zangi, and the Deh Kund\u012b tribes of Haz\u0101ras. In the south and south-east lie Ghazni, Gardesh, Khost, and Log\u0101r.\nThe predominant inhabitants of these districts are Ghilzais and other Afghan tribes, but Haz\u0101ras and T\u0101jiks are also to be found.\n\nThe winters are extremely rigorous; but the spring, summer, and autumn are, with the exception of July and August, quite European in character.\n\nThere are numerous evidences of Persian, Greek, Hindu, Buddhist, and Muhammadan antiquities in the Province. The Surkh Min\u0101r, near K\u0101bul city, is no doubt a copy of the capitals of Persepolitan pillars, while Greek influence is evident in the Buddhist monasteries and st\u016bpas found along the K\u0101bul valley. The valley is also rich in Graeco-Bactrian coins. In the Koh-i-D\u0101man, north of K\u0101bul, are the sites of several ancient cities, the greatest of which, called Begh\u012bram, has furnished thousands of coins, and has been supposed to represent Alexander's Nicaea. Investigations at Jalal\u0101b\u0101d during the late Afgh\u0101n campaign resulted in the recovery of many interesting sculptures in stone, slate, and plaster. Among the most remarkable relics of a bygone age are the colossal figures carved in the cliff at B\u0101mi\u0101n, north of the Koh-i-B\u0101ba, and the adjoining caves. The largest of these figures is 180 feet high. Authorities differ as to their origin, but it seems most probable that they are Buddhist. The surrounding caves answer to the requirements of a Buddhist monastery, and close to the foot of the cliff is a mound resembling a Buddhist st\u016bpa, the exploration of which may some day put the question at rest.\n\nFor history, trade, and industries see Afgh\u0101nist\u0101n and K\u0101bul City.\n\nK\u0101bul City.\u2014Capital of Afgh\u0101nist\u0101n, situated in $34^\\circ 30' \\text{N.}$ and $69^\\circ 13' \\text{E.}$, on the right bank of the K\u0101bul river, a short distance above its junction with the Logar, 181 miles from Pesh\u0101war; 5,780 feet above the sea. North of the city, on the left bank of the river, stand the suburbs of Deh-i-Mur\u0101d Kh\u0101ni, Andar\u0101bai, and Deh-i-Afgh\u0101n; and beyond those is the military cantonment of Sherpur, backed by the Bem\u0101ru hill. To the south-east are the Sher Darw\u0101za heights, to the south the B\u0101la Hiss\u0101r, and to the east the S\u012b\u0101h Sang ridge. On the west the K\u0101bul river flows through the gorge formed by the Asmai and Sher Darw\u0101za hills. The number of inhabitants is probably nearly 150,000, of whom 100,000 are K\u0101bulis, 3,000 Durr\u0101nis, 12,000 T\u0101jiks, 6,500 Kizilb\u0101shis, and 4,000 Hindus. The city is $3\\frac{1}{2}$ miles in circumference and is no longer walled, although traces of a wall remain.\n\nK\u0101bul, though by far the richest city in the Amir\u2019s dominions, contains no external or internal evidences of grandeur. The older houses are built of burnt bricks; the more modern ones of sun-dried bricks and mud. Originally there were seven great gates; now only one remains, the Darw\u0101za-i-L\u0101hauri, on the eastern face. The city is divided into quarters (muhallas) and streets (kuch\u0101s). The principal streets are the\nShor B\u0101z\u0101r and the Ch\u0101r Chatta: they are badly paved, undrained, and exceedingly dirty. The Shor B\u0101z\u0101r extends from the B\u0101la Hiss\u0101r to the Ziarat-i-B\u0101ba Khudi, a distance of about three-quarters of a mile. The Ch\u0101r Chatta consists of four covered arcades at the western end of the street leading from the Darw\u0101za-i-L\u0101hauri. It was destroyed by Pollock in 1842, but restored by Amir Dost Muhammad in 1850. Here are shops tenanted by silk-mercers, jewellers, furriers, cap- and shoemakers, fruiters, and money-changers, all doing a thriving business. The Kizilb\u0101shis live in the separate walled quarter of Chandaul, by the mouth of the Deh Mozang gorge. A row of fine new shops, called B\u0101z\u0101r-i-Nao, has recently been built on the north side of the river, near the Darw\u0101za-i-Ark.\n\nThe climate of K\u0101bul is, on the whole, healthy. The great lake of Wazirabad beyond the Sherpur cantonment has been drained and is now dry; but the marshes between the B\u0101la Hiss\u0101r and Beni Hiss\u0101r give rise to malaria and fevers. The city itself, wedged in between two hills, with its confined streets, want of drainage, and absence of all sanitary arrangements, would seem to labour under strong disadvantages. Nevertheless, there are compensations in an excellent water-supply, a fine atmosphere, and delightful environs; and the death-rate is probably lower than in most Afghan towns. Provisions are abundant and cheap. In ordinary years, barley sells at $2\\frac{1}{2}$ seers per British rupee (about 34 lb. for a shilling), wheat at 18 seers, and flour at 16 seers.\n\nK\u0101bul is believed to be the Ortospanum or Ortospana of Alexander's march. It was attacked by the Arabs as early as the thirty-fifth year of the Hijra, but it was long before the Muhammadans effected any lasting settlement. K\u0101bul first became a capital when B\u0101bar made himself master of it in 1504, and here he reigned for twenty years before his invasion of Hindust\u0101n. It passed on the death of B\u0101bar to his younger son, K\u0101mr\u0101n, who, after several attacks on his brother Hum\u0101y\u016bn, was defeated and blinded by him (1553). Hum\u0101y\u016bn left it to his infant son, Mirza H\u0101kim, on whose death, in 1585, it passed to the latter's elder brother, Akbar. From this time up to its capture by N\u0101dir Sh\u0101h (1738), it was held by the Mughal emperors of India. From N\u0101dir Sh\u0101h it passed to Ahmad Sh\u0101h Durr\u0101ni, whose son, T\u012bm\u016br, made it the capital of his kingdom. It continued to be the capital during the Sadozai dynasty, and is so still under the now reigning B\u0101rakzais.\n\nThe city played an important part in the first Afghan War. In August, 1839, Sh\u0101h Shuj\u0101 entered K\u0101bul as king, escorted by a British army. Throughout that year and the next, the British troops remained without molestation, but in November, 1841, the citizens and Afghan soldiery broke out in rebellion and murdered Sir Alexander Burnes.\nIn December Sir William Macnaghten, our special Envoy, was treacherously shot by Akbar Kh\u0101n, a son of Dost Muhammad, at an interview which had been convened to arrange for the withdrawal of the garrison. On January 6, 1842, the British forces marched out under a solemn guarantee of protection\u20144,500 fighting men, with 12,000 followers. Their fate is well-known: of all that number, only a single man, Dr. Brydon, reached Jal\u0101l\u0101b\u0101d, and ninety-two prisoners were subsequently recovered. Sh\u0101h Shuj\u0101 was assassinated in April, four months after the withdrawal of the British troops. In September, 1842, General Pollock, with the army of retribution, arrived at K\u0101bul, and took possession of the citadel without opposition. Previous to his departure a month later, the great bazar was destroyed by gunpowder, as a retribution for the murder of Sir William Macnaghten.\n\nK\u0101bul was again occupied by British troops in 1879, when an avenging force under General (now Lord) Roberts was sent to exact punishment for the massacre of the British Resident, Sir Louis Cavagnari, and his party, which took place in September of that year. The city remained in British occupation for nearly a year. During the winter the tribesmen rose in large numbers, and, after heavy fighting for several days, the British troops were compelled to concentrate in the Sherpur cantonment, which remained closely invested by at least 50,000 men. A determined attack was beaten off on December 23, 1879; and, on the following day, an additional brigade having arrived and joined General Roberts, the city again passed into his hands, the tribesmen melting away as suddenly as they had appeared. In August, 1880, the British forces evacuated K\u0101bul and returned to India, on the recognition of Abdur Rahm\u0101n Kh\u0101n as Am\u012br.\n\nK\u0101bul does not possess many edifices of antiquarian interest. The four principal mosques at the present time are the Masjid-i-Safed, built by T\u012bm\u016br Sh\u0101h Sadozai; the Masjid-i-B\u0101la Chaok, by B\u0101bar; the Masjid-i-Pul-i-Khishti, by Sh\u0101h Shuj\u0101; and the large J\u0101ma Masjid, by the late Am\u012br. Outside the city are the tombs of B\u0101bar and T\u012bm\u016br Sh\u0101h. The surroundings of B\u0101bar\u2019s tomb have been converted into a garden, beautifully laid out and encircled by a mud wall 30 feet high. It contains a prettily built summer-house. At Indaki, three miles away, overlooking the Chah\u0101rdeh valley, is another charming summer residence and garden; and on the slopes of a hill between Sh\u0101h Mard\u0101n and Wazir\u0101b\u0101d is yet another, known as the B\u0101gh-i-B\u0101la. All these country residences and several others were built in the reign of the late Am\u012br, and are not the least among the many improvements which he effected.\n\nThe old residence of the Am\u012brs used to be in the B\u0101la Hiss\u0101r, but Abdur Rahm\u0101n Kh\u0101n constructed a new fortified palace for himself, described below. The lower B\u0101la Hiss\u0101r has been completely\ndismantled; the old Residency, the scene of the deplorable outbreak where the gallant Cavagnari, all his British officers, and most of his escort met their death in September, 1879, has almost entirely disappeared; and in 1893 the only building inside was Sher Ali Khan's palace, a mere shell, on the eastern wall. In the upper B\u0101la Hissar, just beyond the Residency site, and under the wall of the citadel, an arsenal and extensive storehouses for grain have been constructed.\n\nThe new fortified palace (or Ark as it is locally called) is situated in extensive grounds, not less than three-quarters of a mile by half a mile, between Alamganj and Sherpur. It occupied five years in building, and cost about 20 lakhs of rupees. A considerable portion of the grounds is laid out in fruit and flower gardens. There are two gateways, one facing Alamganj and the other looking east towards Si\u0101h Sang. The fortified Ark is surrounded by a moat. It is a massive structure about 350 yards square; the width of the ditch is not less than 60 feet at the top.\n\nThe works of improvement carried out at K\u0101bul by Abdur Rahm\u0101n Kh\u0101n were by no means limited to the construction of palaces and summer gardens for his personal gratification. He showed a remarkable interest in the development of numerous branches of industry; and the extensive workshops established by him, under European supervision, are a lasting monument to his name. When one remembers that on Abdur Rahm\u0101n's accession, and indeed for nearly ten years later, steam power was unknown throughout Afghanistan, what was accomplished during the second decade of his reign is indeed surprising. On the left bank of the K\u0101bul river, and right in the Deh Mozang gorge, there are now workshops whose output, all circumstances considered, comes up to European standards. The raison d'\u00eatre of these shops is the manufacture of war material, but other handicrafts are also practised. One large shop, for instance, is entirely occupied by men engaged in leather work\u2014boots, saddles, and equipment for the army; another is occupied by steam saw-mills and carpenters; a soap factory turns out 12 tons of soap in a week; candles are manufactured; a mint worked by steam coins 40,000 K\u0101buli rupees a day; and constant labour is found for skilled workers in silver and brass. In 1893 five steam engines were used in the shops; others are believed to have been imported since. The initiation of this great undertaking was due to the late Amir, with Sir Salter Pyne as his principal lieutenant. At one time, in 1892, no less than fourteen Europeans were at K\u0101bul in the Amir's employ, among them a doctor, a geologist, a mining engineer, a gardener, a veterinary surgeon, a tailor, a lapidary, a tanner, and a currier. In 1904 there were only two Europeans at K\u0101bul\u2014a gunsmith and an electrical engineer. About 1,500 men are employed in the shops, the majority being\nK\u0101bulis who have learnt their work from English mechanical engineers and Punjabi artisans, and are now thoroughly efficient.\n\nThere is no occasion to describe in detail the fortifications of K\u0101bul. Those left by the British forces on their withdrawal in August, 1880, are kept in repair; and the cantonment of Sherpur, which afforded accommodation for most of the British force, is now occupied by the Afgh\u0101n garrison.\n\nThere are five bridges across the river at K\u0101bul, one of which (now broken) was built by the emperor B\u0101bar, and another by Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n.\n\nBesides the large trade in local products necessary to meet the requirements of the city population, K\u0101bul is credited in the trade statistics for 1903\u20134 with imports from India to the value of 50 lakhs of rupees, and with exports aggregating nearly 29 lakhs: that is to say, with more than half the entire trade between Afgh\u0101nist\u0101n and British India. The principal imports are British and Indian cotton twist and yarn, piece-goods, manufactured leather, hardware, indigo, sugar, tea, and spices. The principal exports are fresh and dried fruits, asafoetida and other drugs, and furs.\n\nK\u0101bul has attained an enviable reputation for its practically unlimited supply of fruit. Throughout the K\u0101bul valley orchards extend for miles, and hardly a country house is without its large walled garden. The grape here grows to great perfection, the vines never having suffered from the phylloxera of Southern Europe. All the known European fruits, such as the apple, pear, quince, plum, apricot, peach, cherry, mulberry, are found in abundance; and a variety of melon, known as the sarda, which is said to grow only in the K\u0101bul district, is exported to every part of India.\n\nK\u0101bul River.\u2014River of North-Western India, which rises in Afgh\u0101nist\u0101n near the Unai Pass, about 40 miles west of K\u0101bul city, in $34^\\circ 21' N.$ and $68^\\circ 20' E.$ In its upper course it is joined by many small tributaries from the southern slopes of the Laghm\u0101n range. It is at first an inconsiderable stream, being fordable as far as K\u0101bul city. At a short distance beyond this it receives the Logar from the south, and thenceforward becomes a rapid river with a considerable volume of water. About 40 miles below K\u0101bul city it receives from the north the Panjsh\u012br; 15 miles farther on the Tagao; 20 miles below, the united streams of the Aling\u0101r and Alishang; and a few miles above Jal\u0101l\u0101b\u0101d, the Surkh\u0101b from the south. Just below Jal\u0101l\u0101b\u0101d it is joined by the Kunar from the north. After these accessions, the K\u0101bul becomes a large river, nowhere fordable. Flowing with great force, it hugs the north side of the Jal\u0101l\u0101b\u0101d valley until it enters the Mohmand Hills, when it presses towards the north base of the Khyber range, and is confined between hills until it enters British territory.\nnear Michni Fort. Here it divides into two branches, the Adezai on the north and the Nag\u016bm\u0101n on the south.\n\nThe Adezai, or H\u0101jizai, is at present the main stream. It divides the tahsils of Pesh\u0101war and Ch\u0101rsadda for 20 miles, and, after a further course of 10 miles through the latter tahsil, rejoins the Nag\u016bm\u0101n at Nisatta, after receiving the waters of the Sw\u0101t. The Nag\u016bm\u0101n, formerly the main stream, throws off the Budhni, a small branch which supplies the Jui Shaikh canal, and after receiving the drainage of the Khyber Hills, turns north and joins the Sh\u0101h Alam, itself a chord of the Nag\u016bm\u0101n. That stream has a course of 20 miles before it reaches Nisatta, and below that place the joint stream is known as the Landai or 'short' river. The Landai flows between low banks for its first 12 miles, but below Naushahra it has cut a deep channel and its lower reaches are rocky. After a course of 36 miles it falls into the Indus at Attock. Thus the total course of the K\u0101bul river is about 316 miles.\n\nFrom its source to Jal\u0101l\u0101b\u0101d, the river is of no value except for irrigation, which it also affords in the Frontier Province (see K\u0101bul River Canal); from Jal\u0101l\u0101b\u0101d to Dobandi, it affords safe, and generally rapid, descent down stream by means of rafts of inflated skins. This mode of travelling is frequently resorted to, as it saves ten marches which may be traversed in twelve hours when the river is in flood. The boatmen of L\u0101lpura, Jal\u0101l\u0101b\u0101d, and Kunar are a peculiar race, keeping much to themselves, and are known under the generic title of nil\u0101bi. From Dobandi (or Nisatta) to Attock, the K\u0101bul is navigable for boats of 40 or 50 tons.\n\nBetween K\u0101bul city and Jal\u0101l\u0101b\u0101d, the river is fordable in places; but after it has been swelled by the waters of the Logar, the fords are not always practicable; both at Sarobi (opposite Naglu) and at Jal\u0101l\u0101b\u0101d there are alternative fords and ferries. The precarious nature of the Jal\u0101l\u0101b\u0101d ford was illustrated by a catastrophe which occurred in March, 1879, when an officer and forty-six non-commissioned officers and men of the 10th Hussars were drowned while attempting a passage in the dark. The principal ferries between Dobandi and Attock are from Nisatta to Khalil Bandah, and from New to Old Naushahra. The railway from Naushahra to Dargai crosses the river, and there is a bridge of boats at the same site, while another has recently been constructed at L\u0101lpura below Jal\u0101l\u0101b\u0101d. Permanent bridges cross the river in K\u0101bul city.\n\nK\u0101bul River Canal.\u2014A perennial irrigation work in the Pesh\u0101war District of the North-West Frontier Province. It is a revival of an old Mughal canal, and takes off from the right bank of the K\u0101bul river at the village of Warsak on the border of British territory, about 3 miles up-stream from Michni Fort. The main line is 20 feet in width at the\noff-take, and can carry more than 300 cubic feet a second. It crosses the watershed of the country, passing over thirty-six drainage channels of greater or less size, and running close to Pesh\u0101war terminates at the fortieth mile near Naushahra. The distributaries include four branches, with a total length of 19 miles, the largest being the Kuror branch, $9\\frac{1}{2}$ miles long. A small private canal is situated near the canal head. The tract commanded is a long narrow strip of irregular width, bounded on the south and west by the canal itself, and on the north and east, for the upper two-thirds of its length, by the low-lying ground irrigated by old proprietary canals, of which the Jui Shaikh is the most important; while for the lower third of its length the K\u0101bul river is the boundary.\n\nThe area now commanded exceeds 30,000 acres. It is at present considerably interspersed with that irrigated by the Jui Shaikh and other private canals, as well as by the B\u0101r\u0101 river works; but there seems every prospect of the greater portion of all this area ultimately coming under the canal. Irrigation is chiefly for the autumn harvest, and the area of crops actually irrigated during the three years ending 1902 averaged 30,173 acres; in 1903\u20134 it was 27,800 acres. The canal was opened in 1893, the Kuror branch being added subsequently. The capital cost up to March, 1904, was Rs. 6,45,000, and the net income in 1903\u20134 was Rs. 90,800, giving a return of nearly 24 per cent. On October 1, 1903, the revenue management of this canal was taken over by the Irrigation department. An extension called the Haz\u0101r Kh\u0101ni branch is now under construction.\n\nKachch.\u2014State in Bombay. See Cutch.\n\nKachhi.\u2014Division of the Kal\u0101t State, Baluchist\u0101n, lying between $27\u00b0 53'$ and $29\u00b0 35'$ N. and $67\u00b0 11'$ and $68\u00b0 28'$ E. It consists of a flat triangular plain, 5,310 square miles in area, with its base on the Upper Sind Frontier District of Sind, and is enclosed by the Marri and Bugti hills on the east, and by the K\u012brthar and Central Br\u0101hui ranges of the Jhalaw\u0101n country on the west. On the north-east side of its apex lies the British tahsil of Sibi. The only hills, other than the skirts of the surrounding mountains, consist of the low range called Bannh, separating D\u0101dhar on the north from the Bol\u0101n lands on the south. The principal rivers are the N\u0101ri, the Bol\u0101n, the Sukleji, and the M\u016bla. Among the hill-torrents are the Dhoriri, formed by the junction of the Sain and Karu from the Jhalaw\u0101n country, the Lahri, and the Chhatr. On entering Kachhi, all these rivers are dissipated into numberless natural channels, spreading over the great alluvial stretches of which the country is composed.\n\nThe geological structure of the country is uniform, consisting of a level bed of clay burnt by the rays of the sun and probably of great\ndepth. The outskirts of the surrounding hills are of the Siw\u0101lik forma-\ntion. Except along the foot of the hills, the general aspect of the\ncountry is desolate and bare. The flora is thorny and scant, consist-\ning of a stunted scrub. Among the trees occur *Prosopis spicigera*,\n*Salvadora oleoides*, *Capparis aphylla*, and two kinds of *Tamarix*.\nCommon plants are *Calotropis procera* and many saltworts, such as\n*Haloxylon salicornicum*. Wild animals are scarce; a few \u2018ravine deer\u2019\n(gazelle) and other small deer occur, and flocks of sand-grouse visit the\ncultivated areas in winter.\n\nSituated in close proximity to Sind, Kachhi is one of the hottest\nareas in India. Scorching winds blow in the summer, and at times\nthe deadly simoom (*luk*) prevails. Mosquitoes are so numerous that, at\nG\u0101j\u0101n, a special portion of the crop has been assigned to a saint for his\nprotection against them. From November to February the climatic\nconditions are pleasant, the air being crisp and cool. The annual\nrainfall averages about three inches, and usually occurs in July and\nAugust.\n\nThe history of Kachhi is intimately connected with that of Sind. In\nthe seventh century Rai Chach took its capital Kand\u0101bil, probably\nGand\u0101va. To the Arabs the country was known as\n*N\u016bdha* or *B\u016bdha*, and Kand\u0101bil was despoiled by\nthem on several occasions. It afterwards passed into the hands of the\nS\u016bmras and Sammas of Sind. The fifteenth century saw the arrival of\nthe Baloch and the conflicts between their two leaders, M\u012br Ch\u0101kar,\nthe Rind, and Gwahr\u0101m L\u0101sh\u0101ri. The Argh\u016bns next took possession,\nand from them the country passed to the Mughals, and on the decline\nof the latter to the Kalhoras. In 1740 N\u0101dir Sh\u0101h handed it over to\nthe Br\u0101huis in compensation for the death of M\u012br Abdullah, the\nAhmadzai Kh\u0101n of Kal\u0101t, at the hands of the Kalhoras in the fierce\nbattle of J\u0101ndrihar near Sanni. From 1839 to 1842, during the first\nAfghan War, Kachhi was held and administered by the British on their\nlines of communication, and was the scene of much raiding and of two\nfights with the insurgent Br\u0101huis in 1840. After the war General John\nJacob's cavalry was employed in checking the raiding propensities of\nthe Kachhi tribesmen, especially the Jakr\u0101nis, who were subsequently\nremoved to Sind. In the time of M\u012br Khud\u0101d\u0101d Kh\u0101n of Kal\u0101t it\nwas long a scene of anarchy and raiding, and at Bh\u0101g in 1893 this\nruler committed the crime in consequence of which he subsequently\nabdicated.\n\nBuddhist remains have been discovered at Chhalgari and Tambu,\nand many of the mounds scattered through the country would probably\nrepay excavation.\n\nThe number of villages is 606. The population (1901) is 82,909,\nthe majority being Jats. Among important Baloch tribes are the\nRinds, Magassis, and L\u0101sh\u0101ris; and among minor tribes, Buledis, Dombkis, Kaheris, and Umr\u0101nis. Roughly speaking the Magassis and Rinds occupy the west, and the Dombkis, Kaheris, and Umr\u0101nis the east; the Jats are found everywhere as cultivators. A few Br\u0101huis, such as the Rais\u0101nis and Garr\u0101ni Bangulzais, have permanently settled in the north of the country, and in the cold season it is visited by many other Br\u0101huis from the highlands. The occupation of nearly all the people is agriculture. Hindu traders are found in all important villages; the lower castes include potters, sweepers, blacksmiths, and weavers. The most common language is Sind\u012b, but Western Punj\u0101bi and Baluch\u012b are also spoken. Except the Hindu traders, all the people are Sunni Musalm\u0101ns. A sect called Taib ('penitents') has made some progress since 1890.\n\nIt is usual to speak of Kachhi as a desert, but this is a mistake. The soil is extremely fertile wherever it can be irrigated. Its quality depends on the admixture of sand. The best is a light loam mixed with a moderate proportion of sand (matt). Except a fringe of 'wet-crop' area on the west, most of the land entirely depends for cultivation on floods brought down by the rivers from the surrounding hills, the water of which is raised to the surface by a system of large dams constructed in the beds of the rivers by the co-operation of the cultivators. A description of this interesting system is given in the paragraphs on Agriculture in the article on Baluchist\u0101n. The floods generally occur in July and August, but occasionally also in spring. Three crops are harvested during the year: s\u0101nwanri, sarav, and arh\u0101ri. The first is the principal crop, and is sown in July and August and reaped in the autumn. It consists of jow\u0101r, with a little m\u016bng, moth, and bajra. The second, or spring crop, comprises wheat, barley, mustard, and rape; the third, jow\u0101r for fodder, cotton, and water-melons. Kachhi jow\u0101r is renowned for its excellence, and is usually cultivated on a soil known as khauri. Indigo is grown in D\u0101dhar. The cultivation of the sarav crop is uncertain, depending on late floods in August. D\u0101dhar, Sanni, Shor\u0101n, G\u0101j\u0101n, Kun\u0101ra, part of Gand\u0101va, and Jhal are the only places where irrigation from permanent sources exists.\n\nBullocks from N\u0101ri in Kachhi are famous for their shape and strength, and many are purchased by dealers from the Punjab. Camels are bred in some numbers. The breed of horses is excellent. Branded mares number 604, and one stallion was located in the country in April, 1904. The best breeders are the Magassis, Dombkis, and Rinds. The indigenous sheep do not possess fat tails, but many of the fat-tailed variety, known as Khor\u0101s\u0101ni, are brought from the highlands in winter. Of goats, the barbari breed is most prized.\n\nNo 'reserved' forests exist, but protective measures are adopted by\nthe tribal chiefs. The western side of the country contains some well-wooded tracts. A sulphur mine at Sanni was worked in pre-British days by the Amirs of Afgh\u0101nist\u0101n. Ferrous sulphate (z\u0101gh) is found in the mountains near Kotra and Sanni. Earth-salt is manufactured by the lixiviation of salt-bearing earth at G\u0101j\u0101n and Shor\u0101n. Saltpetre is produced in small quantities, and the manufacture of carbonate of soda (khur) from the numerous saltworts is increasing.\n\nThe principal industry is the weaving of coarse cotton cloth. Double coloured cotton sheets (khes) of good quality are produced here and there, while at Lahri and a few other places a fine kind of embroidered leather-work is manufactured. Country rifles, swords, and saddles are made at Bh\u0101g and D\u0101dhar.\n\nMost of the trading class come from Shik\u0101rpur in Sind. The centres of trade are D\u0101dhar, Lahri, H\u0101ji, Bh\u0101g, Shor\u0101n, G\u0101j\u0101n, Kotra, Gand\u0101va, and Jhal. Piece-goods, rice, sugar, and country carts are imported from Sind; dates, gh\u012b, wool, and medicinal drugs from the highlands for re-export. Exports to the highlands include cotton cloth, mustard oil, salt, and silk; the articles supplied to Sind consist chiefly of carbonate of soda, grain, and oilseeds. The North-Western Railway passes through the centre of Kachhi. No metalled roads have been made, but the country is easily traversed in all directions except after heavy floods.\n\nThe principal routes run from Jacob\u0101b\u0101d to Sibi via Lahri on the east; through Shori and Bh\u0101g in the centre; and via Gand\u0101va and Shor\u0101n to D\u0101dhar on the west. The route through the M\u016bla Pass from the Jhalaw\u0101n country debouches at Gand\u0101va.\n\nThe insignificant rainfall, the dependence of the country on flood-irrigation, and the absence of proper means of distributing the flood-water render Kachhi extremely liable to scarcity and even to famine. Under existing conditions enormous quantities of water run to waste in the N\u0101ri in ordinary years, and the introduction of a good irrigation and distribution scheme would doubtless afford a large measure of protection. The proximity of Sind and the free migratory habits of the population have hitherto prevented the necessity of actual famine relief. Advances amounting to about Rs. 29,000 were made to the Kh\u0101n of Kal\u0101t\u2019s cultivators in 1900, when the drought, which had begun in 1897, culminated. They were recovered at the succeeding harvests.\n\nFor purposes of administration, Kachhi is divided into two parts: areas subject to the jurisdiction of the Kh\u0101n of Kal\u0101t, and areas under tribal chiefs. Within the areas subject to the Kh\u0101n, however, tribal units are to be found which occupy a position of practical independence. The political control of the\ncountry east of the railway, i.e. the whole of the Lahri ni\u0101bat, is vested in the Political Agent of Sibi District, and of the remainder in the Political Agent, Kal\u0101t. The area under the Kal\u0101t State is divided into five ni\u0101bats: D\u0101dhar; Bh\u0101g; Lahri, which includes the area occupied by the Dombki, Kaheri, and Umr\u0101ni tribes; Gand\u0101va; and Nasir\u0101b\u0101d. The head-quarters station of each ni\u0101bat is located at a village of the same name, except Nasir\u0101b\u0101d, of which the head-quarters are situated at M\u012brpur Bibiwi\u0101ri. D\u0101dhar, Bh\u0101g combined with Lahri, and Gand\u0101va with Nasir\u0101b\u0101d each forms the charge of a musta\u016bfi, who is generally assisted by local officials known as naib and j\u0101-nashin. D\u0101dhar, however, possesses neither a naib nor a j\u0101-nashin, and Gand\u0101va has no j\u0101-nashin. The principal areas subject to tribal control are Jhal, inhabited by the Magass\u012bs; and Shor\u0101n, held by the Rinds. In Lahri, the Dombkis, Kaheris, and Umr\u0101nis have acquired a large measure of independence. In the ni\u0101bats, criminal, civil, and revenue cases are decided by the local officials; in tribal areas, petty cases are dealt with by the chief, and important or intertribal cases are referred to jirgas or local k\u0101z\u012bs, who exercise much influence, under the orders of the Political Agents. In the numerous j\u0101girs within the Kh\u0101n\u2019s ni\u0101bats, jurisdiction in all petty matters is exercised by the j\u0101gird\u0101rs. The most common offences are cattle-lifting and theft. Cattle are frequently stolen from Sind and sent to the Jhalaw\u0101n country. Much use is made of trackers in the detection of such crimes, and some of these men are very skilful. They are paid by results.\n\nThe land revenue system presents an interesting survival of ancient native methods. The Kh\u0101n collects revenue in his ni\u0101bats, and elsewhere it is taken by tribal chiefs and j\u0101gird\u0101rs. It consists everywhere of a fixed share of the gross produce, varying from one-third to one-tenth, but generally one-third or one-fifth. The additional cesses (ras\u016bm), however, raise the amount paid to one-half. Irrigated lands sometimes pay a fixed cash assessment (kalang). Large j\u0101girs, originally granted for feudal service, are held by the Saraw\u0101n tribesmen in B\u0101l\u0101 N\u0101ri and the Bol\u0101n lands, and by the Jhalaw\u0101n tribes round Gand\u0101va and at Chhatr-Phuleji. The Dombki headman holds one in Lahri. Generally the proprietary right in all areas is held by the local cultivating class, but in the Baloch areas of Jhal and Shor\u0101n it has been transferred in many cases to the chiefs.\n\nBesides the land revenue, contracts are given in the ni\u0101bats for octroi, excise, and the collection of other minor taxes, the proceeds being included in the total revenue. The amount of land revenue proper varies with the extent and time of the floods in the rivers. Thus, in 1902 the Kh\u0101n\u2019s aggregate revenue from all his ni\u0101bats amounted to about 1 lakh, and in 1903 to more than 2\u00bd lakhs; but in the latter year a new system of administration had been introduced.\nThe details of the latter sum are as follows: D\u0101dhar, Rs. 49,200; Bh\u0101g, Rs. 32,500; Lahri, Rs. 58,100; Gand\u0101va, Rs. 55,400; Nasir\u0101b\u0101d, Rs. 56,600.\n\nTribal levies, paid by the British Government and numbering 50, are stationed at Dandor in B\u0101l\u0101 N\u0101ri, Lahri, Phuleji, and along the railway. Detachments, consisting of 85 of the Kh\u0101n\u2019s infantry and 12 artillerymen, are located at D\u0101dhar, Nasir\u0101b\u0101d, and Bh\u0101g; but their numbers vary from time to time. The number of the Kh\u0101n\u2019s irregular levies is generally 91. A tribal th\u0101na of five men is posted at Gandava. Security is provided by the enlistment of kotw\u0101ls, who are paid either by the inhabitants or from the Kh\u0101n\u2019s revenues. Tribal chiefs maintain retainers and dependants, who are employed on revenue duties and in securing the general peace. The same system is followed in the Kh\u0101n\u2019s ni\u0101bats by the local naibs, who distribute their friends and followers throughout the country at the expense of the cultivators. The Rind and Magassi chiefs receive allowances from the Kh\u0101n of Kal\u0101t of Rs. 300 a month each. A jail is now in course of erection at D\u0101dhar; criminals have hitherto generally been kept in the stocks. The country has no schools or dispensaries. Inoculation takes the place of vaccination, being performed by Saiyids, Pirs, Shehs (the local name for Shaikhs), and Ab\u0101bakis from the highlands.\n\nK\u0101chhi Baroda.\u2014Thakur\u0101t in Bhop\u0101war Agency, Central India.\n\nKachins.\u2014A community of Tibeto-Burman origin, inhabiting the north and north-east of Upper Burma and the Shan States. After the Shans and the Chins, the Kachins, known also as Chingpaws or Theinbaws, are the most numerous non-Burman people in the Upper Province. In 1901, 64,405 persons were returned as Kachins, but this includes only the population dealt with in the regularly enumerated areas. In what were known as the \u2018estimated\u2019 areas no race data were collected; but it is certain that at least three-eighths of the 127,011 persons inhabiting these areas were Kachins, and it will be safe to put the total of the race at nearly 120,000. About one-half of the population of Myitkyin\u0101 District is Kachin; and Kachins form a substantial portion of the inhabitants of Bhamo, Kath\u0101, and the Ruby Mines, and of the Northern Shan States. Of the same primaeval stock as the Burmans and the Tibetans, the Kachins seem to have remained for centuries in possession of the uplands about and to the north of the head-waters of the western branch of the Irrawaddy, and it is only within the last few decades that they have encroached on their neighbours in the south. Of recent years, however, observers have had an opportunity of witnessing in the Kachins what in all probability will be the last of those immigration waves from the north that have played so important a part in the history of the Indo-Chinese Peninsula. The Kachin tribes have penetrated westwards into Assam, where they are\nknown as Singphos, and as far down the valley of the Irrawaddy as Kath\u0101 District; but here they appear for the time being to have been brought to a halt by contact with a comparatively dense population. Though checked in one direction, the southward movement still continues. The line of least resistance has now shifted to the east: the borders of the Northern Shan States, till recently inhabited only by Shans and Palaungs, have been gradually overrun; and in the direction of China the Kachins have worked their way as far south as the trans-Salween State of Kengtung. The next few years will probably see a further extension of the race in a southerly direction. The Kachins have given considerable trouble on the frontier in the past, and more than one punitive expedition has had to be sent against them.\n\nStrictly speaking, Chingpaw is the name given only to the southern section of the Kachin race, the communities farther north being known generally as Khakus. The social system of the Kachins is tribal, but nothing approaching to tribal federation is known. The five principal tribes are the Marips, the Lepais, the Lahtawngs, the \u2019Nkhums, and the Marans. Subdivisions, clans, and families abound. About one hundred family names have been recorded, and persons bearing the same family name do not intermarry. The Kachins are practically all spirit-worshippers, and their nats are extremely numerous and, for the most part, malignant. The Kachin places himself en rapport with the spirit world through the offices of a medium (mi-twe) or a professional priest (tumso). Divination is frequently resorted to by this very superstitious race. The dead are disposed of by burial. Taungya (shifting cultivation) is the usual form of agriculture practised in the Kachin country, rice being the main crop. The Kachin house is ordinarily far larger than a Burmese or Shan dwelling, and has many points of resemblance to the lengthy structure seen in some Palaung villages. Slavery still exists among the Kachins, but only to the modified extent in which it survives among the Chins of the Chin Hills. The Kachin physical type varies considerably. Though the physiognomy is Mongolian and often of a character far from attractive to Europeans, aquiline noses are not unknown and regular features are occasionally met with. The figure is short but wiry. There is nothing very distinctive about the dress of the Kachin men. They wear as a rule a dark jacket, a waistcloth (frequently of a plaid pattern) or Shan trousers according to their habitat, and a turban varying from locality to locality. The women ordinarily wear a jacket, sometimes long with long sleeves, sometimes short and practically sleeveless, as well as a skirt and turban, which, in the case of Chingpaw women, is often of considerable size. Wherever the means of the wearer allow it, silver torques are worn by the Chingpaw women. The Kachins speak a language belonging to the same linguistic sub-family as\nBurmese, and resembling the latter closely in grammatical structure. It has various dialects, but they do not differ materially from one another. The Marus, the Szis, and the Lashis, hill tribes of the north-eastern frontier, have been looked upon as Kachins, whom they resemble somewhat in manners and dress. It appears, however, probable from their language that these tribes are more nearly connected with the Burmans than with the Kachins. Their original home was probably to the east of that of the Kachins.\n\n**K\u0101chola.**\u2014An estate in the north-east of the State of Udaipur, Rajputana, held by the R\u0101j\u0101 Dhiraj of Sh\u0101hpura as a grant from the Mah\u0101r\u0101n\u0101, on payment of a tribute of about Rs. 2,400 and the performance of service. The nature of the service to be performed has long been in dispute; but it has recently been decided that the R\u0101j\u0101 Dhiraj is to send his usual quota of troops for three months every year to Udaipur, and is himself to attend for one month at the same place every alternate year, generally at the Dasahra festival. The estate consists of 90 villages with (1901) 12,515 inhabitants, the majority of whom are J\u0101ts, Gujars, R\u0101jputs, and Br\u0101hmans. The head-quarters are at the small town of K\u0101chola, situated in 25\u00b0 24\u2032 N. and 75\u00b0 8\u2032 E., 3 miles east of the Ban\u0101s river, about 100 miles north-east of Udaipur city and 20 miles south-east of the town of Sh\u0101hpura.\n\n**Kachu\u0101.**\u2014Village in the B\u0101gherh\u0101t subdivision of Khuln\u0101 District, Bengal, situated in 22\u00b0 39\u2032 N. and 89\u00b0 53\u2032 E., at the junction of the Bhairab and Madhumat\u012b rivers. Population (1901), 247. Kachu\u0101 is one of three market-places established by Mr. Henckell in the Sundarbans in 1782\u20133; the other two, Ch\u0101ndkh\u0101li and Henckellganj, are now of no importance, but Kachu\u0101 still has a large bazar. The principal export is rice; large quantities of kachu, a kind of yam, are also grown, from which the village possibly derives its name.\n\n**Kadaiyanall\u016br.**\u2014Town in the Tenk\u0101si t\u0101luk, Tinnevelly District, Madras, situated in 9\u00b0 4\u2032 N. and 77\u00b0 20\u2032 E. The population in 1901 was 13,939, weavers forming a large proportion. Local affairs are managed by a Union panch\u0101yat.\n\n**Kad\u0101na.**\u2014Petty State in Rew\u0101 K\u0101nth\u0101, Bombay.\n\n**Kadapa.**\u2014District, subdivision, t\u0101luk, and town in Madras. See Cuddapah.\n\n**Kadaura.**\u2014Chief town of the Baoni State, Central India, situated in 26\u00b0 N. and 79\u00b0 50\u2032 E., 15 miles from Kalpi station on the Jhansi-Cawnpore section of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway. It became the head-quarters about 1820, before which date the chiefs lived at Kalpi. Population (1901), 3,004.\n\n**Kadi Pr\u0101nt.**\u2014A pr\u0101nt or district in Baroda State, situated in Northern Gujar\u0101t, between 23\u00b0 and 24\u00b0 9\u2032 N. and 71\u00b0 15\u2032 and 71\u00b0 50\u2032 E., with an area of 3,015 square miles. It is the largest and most pro-\nductive of the four pr\u0101nt into which the Gaikw\u0101r\u2019s territory is divided. It is bounded on the north by the States of P\u0101lanpur and R\u0101dhanpur; on the west by R\u0101dhanpur State and Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d District; on the south by Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d and Kaira; and on the east by the Mah\u012b K\u0101nth\u0101 States. Most of the pr\u0101nt lies west of the S\u0101barmat\u012b, and consists of a dreary looking plain, with few trees except near village sites. Some scattered portions east of the river are well wooded, and contain a few small but picturesque hillocks. The chief rivers are the S\u0101barmat\u012b, the Saraswati, and the Ban\u0101s.\n\nThe greater part of the area is under cultivation, the fields being often surrounded by hedges composed of species like Capparis grandis, C. sepiaria, Jatropha Curcas, Euphorbia antiquorum, with various Leguminosae, Menispermaceae, Asclepiadaceae, and Convolvulaceae among the climbers. On waste ground such species as Calotropis gigantea, Jatropha gossypifolia, Fagonia arabica, Echinops echinatus, and Tephrosia purpurea are found. Field-weeds include Celsia coromandeliana, Sphaeranthus indicus, Launaea nudicaulis, Coldenia procumbens, and Blumea eriantha. Damp ground and stream beds contain Aeluropus villosus, Herpestis Monnieria, Mollugo hirta, Cyperus laevigatus, Scirpus subulatus, Hydrilla verticillata, and Potamogeton pectinatus. The planted or semi-spontaneous species near habitations include the mango, tamarind, teak, custard-apple, pomegranate, bael, and various species of Ficus, such as banyan and pipal.\n\nKadi is considered to be the healthiest part of the State, the t\u0101lukas of Dehg\u0101m, Vij\u0101pur, Visnagar, and P\u0101tan being favourably known for the comparative absence of malaria.\n\nThe population was estimated at 850,325 in 1872. At the three following enumerations it was: (1881) 988,487, (1891) 1,098,742, and (1901) 834,714. The pr\u0101nt suffered severely in the famine of 1899\u20131900. It is divided into ten t\u0101lukas or mah\u0101ls, and two petas or sub-mah\u0101ls, statistics of which in 1901 are given in the table on the next page.\n\nThe chief towns are P\u0101tan, Visnagar, Sidhpur, Vadnagar, Kadi, Unjh\u0101, Mehs\u0101na (the head-quarters), Vij\u0101pur, Ch\u0101nasma, Kher\u0101lu, L\u0101dol, K\u0101l\u014dl, Val\u0101m, and Umta. About 98 per cent. of the population speak Gujar\u0101t\u012b. In 1901 only 8 native Christians were enumerated in the pr\u0101nt, but the American Methodist Episcopal Mission claims 250 adherents in eight villages, and provides five day schools.\n\nAbout 90 per cent. of the total area is composed of light sandy soil, which is very productive if manured and irrigated. Black soil is found in patches. Irrigation is chiefly supplied by wells, including large temporary wells which are used for a single season. The principal crops are bajra, jow\u0101r, wheat, banti, dangar, barley, vari, kadra, chenna, kuri, l\u0101vto, chasatio, k\u0101ng, math, mag, udid, guv\u0101r, tuver, chola, chana,\nval, kulthi, sarsav, erandi, poppy, tal, kasumbo, tobacco, sugar-cane, cotton, bhendi, chillies, sakaria, and other garden products. Poppy is of great importance and covered 12,262 acres in 1904-5, yielding on an average 12 lb. of crude opium per acre.\n\n| Taluka   | Area in square miles | Number of Towns | Villages | Population | Population per square mile | Percentage of variation in population between 1891 and 1901 | Number of persons able to read and write |\n|----------|----------------------|----------------|----------|------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Kadi     | 331                  | 1              | 118      | 71,784     | 217                         | -25.8                                                     | 4,342                                  |\n| Kalol    | 267                  | 1              | 88       | 80,532     | 302                         | -17.1                                                     | 5,938                                  |\n| Vijapur  | 346                  | 2              | 107      | 117,286    | 339                         | -24.9                                                     | 5,301                                  |\n| Mehsana  | 195                  | 1              | 83       | 75,254     | 386                         | -10.2                                                     | 4,314                                  |\n| Visnagar | 172                  | 2              | 54       | 70,989     | 471                         | -2.7                                                      | 5,319                                  |\n| Vadnavli | 332                  | 2              | 113      | 67,302     | 203                         | -33.7                                                     | 2,839                                  |\n| Patan    | 409                  | 2              | 140      | 104,136    | 255                         | -2.3                                                      | 7,605                                  |\n| Sidhpur  | 254                  | 2              | 78       | 99,161     | 385                         | -16.1                                                     | 5,584                                  |\n| Kheralu  | 246                  | 3              | 88       | 76,463     | 311                         | -22.5                                                     | 4,408                                  |\n| Harj    | 154                  | ...            | 43       | 12,505     | 81                          | -57.1                                                     | 346                                    |\n| Dehgam   | 239                  | 1              | 95       | 49,461     | 207                         | -28.6                                                     | 2,865                                  |\n| Atarsumba| 70                   | 1              | 56       | 18,871     | 270                         | -37.9                                                     | 1,276                                  |\n\nTotal 3,015 18 1,063 834,744 277 -24.0 49,237\n\nThe spinning of cotton thread and silk and cotton-weaving are the chief industries. There may also be mentioned: embroidery on a small scale; the manufacture of ornaments in gold, silver, and ivory, and of betel-nut cutters, knives, brass and copper utensils, toys, and pottery. The number of ginning factories is six, one being connected with a weaving-mill. The chief centres of trade are Patan, Kadi, Mehsana, Visnagar, Vadnagar, and Sidhpur, the first being the most important. All these towns are connected by railway lines, by which the prant is exceptionally well served. In addition to the main line of the Rajputana-Malwa Railway, which passes from south to north, State lines diverge from Mehsana to Kheralu, Patan, and Viramgam, and from Kalol to Kadi and Vijapur. The Ahmadabad-Parantij line also serves some places. Other lines are projected from Manund Road to Chanasma, from Visnagar to Vijapur, and from Kheralu to Dabhoda.\n\nThe land revenue rose from 32.2 lakhs in 1881 to 35.8 lakhs in 1891, and was 35.5 lakhs in 1901; but in 1904-5, while the demand was 22 lakhs, the collections amounted to only 11.2 lakhs. A settlement for fifteen years was made between 1891 and 1900, and parts of the prant are now being resettled. The prant contains 36 mehwasi villages, which were formerly assessed on the cultivated area only, but a settlement has now been made on the ordinary lines at greatly reduced rates. The average assessment varies in different talukas from\nRs. 1-3-0 to Rs. 2-8-0 per bigha (4/7 acre) for 'dry' land, and from Rs. 1-9-0 to Rs. 2-11-0 for 'wet' land.\n\nThe pr\u0101nt contains twelve municipalities, three of which are administered by boards reconstituted in 1905 on a partly elective basis. These latter\u2014P\u0101tan, Sidhpur, and Visnagar\u2014have a total income of Rs. 21,500 from customs, excise, and tolls, besides grants of Rs. 7,000; and the remaining nine receive grants of Rs. 20,500. A District board and local boards were constituted in 1905.\n\nThe administration is carried on by the S\u016bbah, while the court of the pr\u0101nt Judge is at Visnagar. Education is well provided for, as the pr\u0101nt has one high school (at P\u0101tan), 6 Anglo-veracular schools, and 360 vernacular schools, the total number of pupils in 1904\u20135 being 25,316. Two civil hospitals and eleven dispensaries treated 86,329 patients in 1904\u20135, of whom 359 were in-patients.\n\nKadi T\u0101luka.\u2014South-western t\u0101luka of the Kadi pr\u0101nt, Baroda State, with an area of 331 square miles. The population fell from 96,782 in 1891 to 71,784 in 1901. The t\u0101luka contains one town, Kadi (population, 13,070), the head-quarters of the t\u0101luk, and of the pr\u0101nt until 1904; and 118 villages. The general aspect of the t\u0101luka is very unprepossessing, as it consists for the most part of an uninterrupted plain bare of all trees. Round the town of Kadi, however, and in its neighbourhood there are trees in fair abundance, a gentle undulating country, and numerous tanks. The soil for the most part is light and sandy. In 1904\u20135 the land revenue was Rs. 2,58,000.\n\nKadi Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the t\u0101luka of the same name, Baroda State, situated in 23\u00b0 18' N. and 72\u00b0 2' E., on the Gaikw\u0101r's State line from K\u0101l\u014dl on the R\u0101jput\u0101na-M\u0101lw\u0101 Railway. Population (1901), 13,070. It is a place of some importance in the State, owing to its connexion with Malh\u0101r Rao, who held it as j\u0101gird\u0101r and rebelled against the Gaikw\u0101r Govind Rao. Till 1904 it was the head-quarters of the Kadi pr\u0101nt. The town seen from a distance presents rather a picturesque appearance, the domes of the fort gleaming from the thick wood which surrounds it. To the north lies a broad sheet of water fringed with trees, and on the edge which touches the houses the domed gate or Gumit Darw\u0101za is effectively placed. The fort itself stands on a slight elevation; and its brick walls and numerous buttresses, though they enclose no great area, are of enormous thickness and in a good state of preservation. The chief buildings inside the fort are the Rang and Supra Mahals, while behind it is the palace or sark\u0101rtv\u0101da, which was formerly occupied by the S\u016bbah's and other offices. In addition, the town possesses a civil hospital, courts, jail, Anglo-veracular and vernacular schools, and various dharms\u0101las and temples. Its narrow streets contain gaudily painted houses, lavishly decorated with wood-carving, but the choking dust and the crumbled appearance of the\ngenerality of the habitations give Kadi a mournful look. The State makes an annual grant of Rs. 2,700 to the municipality. Several fairs are held during the year, but the trade of the town is not very great. The chief industries are weaving, calico-printing, and the manufacture of brass and copper utensils. The cantonment is at present garrisoned by a detachment of State troops.\n\nK\u0101dipur.\u2014Eastern tahsil of Sult\u0101npur District, United Provinces, comprising the parganas of Aldemau and Ch\u0101nd\u0101, and lying between 25\u00b0 59' and 26\u00b0 23' N. and 82\u00b0 6' and 82\u00b0 41' E., with an area of 442 square miles. Population fell from 274,458 in 1891 to 265,450 in 1901, the rate of decrease being the highest in the District. There are 741 villages, but no town. The demand for land revenue in 1903-4 was Rs. 3,69,000, and for cesses Rs. 59,000. The density of population, 601 persons per square mile, is below the District average. The tahsil is crossed by the Gumti, and contains a large area of low-lying, badly drained ground. It thus suffers considerably in wet years, such as 1894. In 1903-4 the area under cultivation was 263 square miles, of which 151 were irrigated. Wells and tanks or jhils are of almost equal importance as a source of supply in ordinary years.\n\nK\u0101dir\u0101b\u0101d.\u2014Walled town in the J\u0101lna t\u0101luk of Aurang\u0101b\u0101d District, Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State, situated in 19\u00b0 51' N. and 75\u00b0 55' E., on the left bank of the Kundlika, opposite the town of J\u0101lna. Population (1901), 11,159. It is an important centre of the grain and cotton trade, and contains a weekly bazar for grain and cattle. There are three ginning and two pressing mills, employing 470 hands. Post and customs offices are located here.\n\nKadiri T\u0101luk.\u2014Western t\u0101luk of Cuddapah District, Madras, lying between 13\u00b0 47' and 14\u00b0 31' N. and 77\u00b0 51' and 78\u00b0 28' E., with an area of 1,158 square miles. It is very irregular in shape, its extreme length being 45 miles, and its maximum breadth 35 miles. The population in 1901 was 145,503, compared with 134,915 in 1891, the increase during the decade being greater than in any other t\u0101luk of the District. The density was 126 persons per square mile, compared with the District average of 148. It contains one town, Kadiri (population, 10,493), the head-quarters; and 139 villages. The demand for land revenue and cesses in 1903-4 amounted to Rs. 2,07,000. The t\u0101luk is very stony and barren, and is cut up by detached rocky hills which are usually destitute of vegetation. During the hot season the ryots entirely depend for water on wells, the rivers and almost all the tanks being quite dry. These wells are constructed at great cost and with considerable labour, the ground below the thin surface soil being often solid rock. The Maduleru, one of the feeders of the Chitr\u0101vati, rises in the t\u0101luk, and the P\u0101paghni passes through its southern and south-eastern portions; but they are of little use for irrigation. The soil is very poor, being\nchiefly coarse red earth mixed with disintegrated granite, which is often impregnated with soda and other salts. Black cotton soil is, however, met with in patches here and there. The chief products are horse-gram, cholam, sugar-cane, and cotton. A good deal of jaggery (coarse sugar) is produced. Hematite occurs in small quantities and used to be smelted by the primitive native processes.\n\nKadiri Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the taluk of the same name in Cuddapah District, Madras, situated in $14^\\circ 6'$ N. and $78^\\circ 10'$ E. Population (1901), 10,493. A large temple here (one of the most famous in the District) is dedicated to Narasimha, to whose festival many pilgrims resort in the early part of the year. It is said that an image of Narasimha was found in an ant-hill under a chandra tree, but the same story is told of other places. The name of this tree in Sanskrit is khadri; and tradition states that when the jungle was cleared by Ranga Nayudu, a local chieftain of Patnam, and the temple was built, this name was given to the town which arose round the shrine. It was for a long time the practice to let loose a tiger or leopard at the festival here in January and shoot at it, but one year a bystander was shot instead, and the custom was prohibited by the Collector. Two days after the car-procession, Paraiyans and other low-caste people\u2014contrary to all precedent\u2014are allowed to enter the temple. They bathe in the river close by and pass into the building in great crowds, carrying small bundles containing coin and jewels wrapped up in cloths, which they present to the god. These bundles are received by a person employed by contractors who farm the privilege.\n\nKadiri shows signs of having at one time been a Musalm\u0101n town. Though the existing buildings bear no trace of Muhammadan architecture, for two miles round there is a large number of tombs and mosques, mostly decayed but some still well preserved. The place was formerly the seat of a local chieftain. When Munro took over the country he sent for the chief to settle with him the amount of revenue he was to pay. The man refused to come, so a detachment was sent against him. They surprised the fortified temple in which he had taken post, but he escaped in the confusion. His possessions were, however, confiscated. Since the town became a station on the South Indian Railway, it has increased in importance as a trade centre. A brisk business in grain is transacted. There is a branch of the London Missionary Society.\n\nKadod.\u2014Place of Hindu pilgrimage in the Broach taluka of Broach District, Bombay, situated in $21^\\circ 44'$ N. and $73^\\circ 8'$ E., on the right bank of the Narbad\u0101, about half-way between the city of Broach and Suklat\u012brtha. The site of the fair is a very small hamlet with only twelve houses and a population (1901) of 53. The ceremonies, which occur once in every nineteen years when Vaish\u0101kh (April\u2013May) happens to be\nthe intercalary month, are in honour of Mah\u0101deo, under the name of Koteswar or Kotilingeshwar, and last for a whole month. Mr. Williams in his Memoir on Broach mentions that one of the periodical gatherings took place in 1812. In that year the total number of visitors was estimated at 200,000, and the most perfect order and good conduct are said to have been maintained by the crowd. In 1869 people began to collect on April 13, and all was not over till May 11; the greatest attendance at any one time was estimated at 100,000, and the total throughout the whole month at 500,000. The last fair was held in 1888, when the bed of the river was crowded with lingams, which the people in many cases carried away to their homes. During the time of the fair the pilgrims live in sheds and temporary huts. The Narbad\u0101 flows close by the site of the fair; but as the gathering takes place in the hot season, and below the limit of the tide, fresh water is hard to obtain. There is a temple at Kadod consisting of one chamber about 11 feet square, and entered by a door 5 feet 2 inches high and 3 feet 3 inches wide.\n\nKadoli.\u2014Petty State in Mah\u012b K\u0101nth\u0101, Bombay.\n\nKad\u016br District.\u2014District in the west of the State of Mysore, lying between 12\u00b0 55' and 13\u00b0 54' N. and 75\u00b0 5' and 76\u00b0 22' E., with an area of 2,813 square miles. It is bounded on the north by Shimoga District; on the east by Chitaldroog and Tumk\u016br Districts; on the south by Hassan District; and on the west by the South Kanara District of Madras.\n\nThe main part of the District is composed of the most mountainous region within the limits of Mysore. Bordered on the west by the mighty Gh\u0101t range, rising at this part into some of the loftiest peaks between the Him\u0101layas and the Nilgiris; supporting on its centre the stupendous barrier of the B\u0101b\u0101 Budan chain, of even superior elevation; between these towering masses covered with a complete network of lofty hills whose altitude at certain points, as in the grand Merti peak of Kalasa, renders them conspicuous landmarks even in this region of heights, while ranges of more modest pretensions extend throughout the north and east\u2014this District, with a slight exception eastwards, may truly be described as pre-eminently the Maln\u0101d or \u2018highland country.\u2019 Nor are these mountain tracts wanting in those charms of wood and water which tend to soften the harsher features of so rugged a landscape. For though the summits rear themselves bareheaded into space, the slopes are thickly clad with pr\u012bmaeval forest, through which the shining streams thread their often headlong way, fertilizing the narrow valleys and open glades, till their waters descend to the level of the larger rivers, flowing in steep and sunken channels, whence issue dense mists that cover the face of the country, only lifting as the heat of the morning sun increases.\nin power. In these vast solitudes the habitations of man are few and far between. A single homestead, hidden amid the luxuriance of tropical vegetation, is often the only sign of human presence for many miles around. Roads there used to be none. All the valuable produce of the country was, and to a great extent still is, transported on the backs of cattle, the rallying sounds from the belled leaders of the drove resounding far and wide. The eastern or Maid\u0101n t\u0101luks partake of the general features of that description of country in the other Districts, the transition from Maln\u0101d to Maid\u0101n being very abrupt and striking on approaching Lakvalli from the west.\n\nThe congeries of mountains, so far as they can be reduced to a system, seem to range themselves into a central ridge running north and south, with a great loop or circle on either hand; while at the south-western angle the Western Gh\u0101ts make a bend inwards to the east, marking the initial point of the line which divides the northern from the southern waters of Mysore. The main ridge spoken of above commences at Ball\u0101lr\u0101yandurga, and passing east of Mertigudda and Koppadurga, separates the basin of the Bhadra from that of the Tunga, and runs up towards Mandagadde, connecting with the central range of Shimoga District. On the west of this ridge is the valley in which Sringeri stands, enclosed with a girdle of mountains; while to the east of it, beyond the right bank of the Bhadra, is the J\u0101gar valley, completely environed with the B\u0101b\u0101 Budan Mountains. The highest point in the District, and in Mysore, is Mulainagiri in the B\u0101b\u0101 Budans, which rises to 6,317 feet above the sea. In the same group, B\u0101b\u0101-Budan-giri is 6,214 feet, and Kalhattigiri 6,155. The loftiest peak in the Western Gh\u0101ts is the Kudremukh or \u2018horse-face\u2019 mountain, so called on account of its appearance from the sea, to which it presents a landmark well-known to navigators on the west coast. Its height is 6,215 feet. Of other conspicuous points, the grand Ball\u0101lr\u0101yandurga is 4,940 feet, Gang\u0101m\u016bla in the Var\u0101haparvata 4,781, Woddingudda 5,006, Lakkeparvata 4,662. The superb hill of Kalasa, called the Mertigudda, situated in the heart of the mountain region to the west, is 5,451 feet. Kanchinkaldurga is 4,081 feet, and Sakunagiri 4,653.\n\nThe principal rivers are the twin streams, the Tunga and Bhadra. They both rise at Gang\u0101m\u016bla in the Var\u0101haparvata in the Western Gh\u0101ts. The Tunga flows north-east past Sringeri, and then turns north-by-west to Shimoga District. The Bhadra runs east past Kalasa, and then with a north-easterly course across the western opening of the B\u0101b\u0101 Budan horseshoe, receives the Somav\u0101hini from the J\u0101gar valley on the east, and passes on to Shimoga District. On the east of the B\u0101b\u0101 Budans the Gaurihalla and Avati are twin streams, rising near Mulainagiri. The first expands into the Ayyankere Lake near Sakarepatna, and taking the name of Veda runs north-east to Kad\u016br.\nThe other, the northern stream, forms the large Madaga tank; and the two, uniting near Kad\u016br town, continue under the name of Ved\u0101vati into Chitaldroog District.\n\nThe Shimoga schistose band extends to the southern boundary of the District, and spreads from near Kad\u016br town to the edge of the Western Gh\u0101ts, where it forms much of the high Gh\u0101t country culminating in the Kudremukh. From this point the western boundary is probably continuous up to Anantapur (Shimoga District). At Kudremukh the schistose beds are nearly horizontal, with a slight dip to the north; the scarp on the southern side of the mountain, descending to South Kanara, displays a series of Dh\u0101rw\u0101r rocks about 5,000 feet in thickness, composed largely of trap flows, with some beds of micaceous and other schists, and resting unconformably on the denuded surface of the Archaean rocks below. On the eastern side of the band, near Ajjampur, the rocks dip generally to the east. To the south and west of Tarikere large masses of chloritic schists occur; and underlying these to the south is a great thickness of trap flows, forming part of the Santaveri and B\u0101b\u0101 Budan mountains. The trap flows are disposed in a very flat anticlinal curve, and to the west are seen to be overlaid by a great thickness of dark schists, with haematite bands and quartzites overlying these again. In the country around Ajjampur and Tarikere masses of conglomerate are developed, consisting chiefly of large boulders and pebbles of granite in a quartz-felspar-chlorite matrix; these pass through various gradations into grits, quartzites, and chloritic schists.\n\nAt the extreme heights of Mulainagiri and Kudremukh the mountains are clothed with grass and herbs, but are generally bare of trees. The plants of the west of Mysore and of Coorg are nearly all found in this alpine District, in addition to such as Lysimachia deltoides, Anemone rivularis, Ranunculus diffusus, Cinnamomum Wightii, with other genera and species far too numerous to mention.\n\nAt Chikmugal\u016br, the head-quarters, the mean annual temperature is between $72^\\circ$ and $73^\\circ$, the daily range being about $20^\\circ$. The temperature of the Malnad often falls much lower, the cold in the early morning at Christmas time being very sharp. Malarious jungle fevers are always prevalent at certain seasons, and neither Europeans nor natives are exempt from attacks. The average annual rainfall at Chikmugal\u016br is variously stated at from 36 to 42 inches. But the country lying within the Western Gh\u0101ts has a far heavier fall. The annual average at Koppa is given as 122 inches, and at Mudgere as 103. At Hariharpur 166 inches fell in 1874; at Mudgere 194 inches in 1882; and at certain coffee estates in that t\u0101luk 145 and 156 inches have been received in a year. The fall is heaviest in June, July, and August, there being 43 inches in July alone.\n\nThe west was from an early period subject to the Kadambas, and the\nremainder of the District to the Gangas. About the eighth century the S\u0101ntara kingdom was established at Pomburchcha or Humcha in Shimoga District. The S\u0101ntaras extended their rule southwards as far as Kalasa in this District, and at a later period made their capital at Sisila or Sisugal\u012b at the foot of the Gh\u0101ts in Mudgere. Eventually their capital was at K\u0101rkala in South Kanara. At one time they acknowledged the supremacy of the Ch\u0101lukyas, and were stanch Jains. But under Vijayanagar rule they became Ling\u0101yats, and were known as the Bhairarasa Wodeyars.\n\nMeanwhile, the Hoysalas arose at the beginning of the eleventh century, their original seat being Sosev\u016br, now Angadi in the Mudgere taluk. They were supreme throughout Mysore and beyond from the twelfth to the fourteenth century, when they were overthrown by Musalm\u0101n invasions from the north of India. The Vijayanagar empire was founded in 1336, and its success at first was greatly due to the aid given by the head of the Sringeri math, originally established by the reformer Sankar\u0101ch\u0101rya in the eighth century. In consequence of this aid the capital of the new empire was called Vidy\u0101nagara, after Vidy\u0101ranya or M\u0101dhava, its first minister, who was also the head of the math. Vidy\u0101nagara in course of time passed into the form Vijayanagara.\n\nAfter the fall of Vijayanagar, the Keladi chiefs of Bedn\u016br assumed independence, and restored the possessions of the Sringeri math. In the seventeenth century Sivappa Naik of Bedn\u016br overran many parts of the District. But he was opposed by Mysore; and in 1694 a treaty was signed between the two powers, by which the latter gained nearly the whole of the District, and Haidar Ali\u2019s conquest of Bedn\u016br in 1763 completed its inclusion in Mysore. In the east, Tarikere was the seat of a line of feudatory chiefs driven out of Basav\u0101patna in Shimoga District by the Bijapur invasions of the seventeenth century. When, in 1830, a rebellion broke out in the Nagar country, owing to the misrule of the R\u0101j\u0101, the Tarikere chief was one of the first to escape from Mysore and join the rebels. The result was the extinction of this line of chiefs. The opening out of the inaccessible Maln\u0101d country in the west by roads at the end of last century has secured the peace of that wild part.\n\nThe most important archaeological feature is the Amritesvara temple near Tarikere, erected in the twelfth century, under the Hoysalas. Some interesting Jain temples are represented by the ruins at Sosev\u016br or Angadi, the place of origin of the Hoysalas, which contain fine specimens of carving. The Vidy\u0101sankara temple at Sringeri is an effective building, in the Dravidian style of Vijayanager. The inscriptions of the District have been translated and published.\n\nThe population at each Census in the last thirty years was: (1871)\n310,176, (1881) 293,822, (1891) 332,025, and (1901) 362,752. The decrease in 1881 was due to the famine of 1876-8.\n\nBy religion, in 1901 there were 326,960 Hindus, 18,144 Musalmans, 12,205 Animists, 3,888 Christians, and 1,554 Jains. The density of population is 129 persons per square mile, that for the State being 185. The number of towns is 10, and of villages 1,352.\n\nThe following are the principal statistics of population in 1901:\n\n| Taluk     | Area in square miles | Number of Towns | Villages | Population | Population per square mile | Percentage of variation in population between 1891 and 1901 | Number of persons able to read and write |\n|-----------|----------------------|-----------------|----------|------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Kadur     | 571                  | 3               | 317      | 80,994     | 142                         | + 12.9                                                   | 4,068                                  |\n| Chikmugalur | 638                 | 1               | 235      | 90,681     | 142                         | + 6.6                                                    | 5,882                                  |\n| Mudgere   | 435                  | 1               | 137      | 46,212     | 107                         | + 11.7                                                   | 2,284                                  |\n| Koppa     | 657                  | 2               | 168      | 54,827     | 83                          | + 1.4                                                    | 3,445                                  |\n| Sringeri Jagir | 44         | 1               | 259      | 10,626     | 244                         | + 16.5                                                   | 1,216                                  |\n| Tarikere  | 498                  | 2               | 236      | 79,472     | 170                         | + 12.5                                                   | 4,392                                  |\n| District total | 2,813          | 10              | 1,352    | 362,752    | 129                         | + 9.1                                                    | 21,287                                 |\n\nNote.\u2014In 1902-3 a transfer of 25 square miles was made from the Kadar taluk to Chitaldroog District.\n\nAs regards castes, Lingayats number 70,000; the outcaste Holeyas and Madigas, 56,000 and 13,000; Wokkaligas or cultivators, 50,000. Of Brahmins there are 18,000. Two-thirds of the Musalmans are Shaikhs, 12,000. Of nomads, Lambanis number 8,600; Koramas, 2,000; and Iruligas, 1,200. By occupation, 70.3 per cent. are engaged in agriculture and pasture, 12.3 per cent. in unskilled labour not agricultural, and 6.9 per cent. in the preparation and supply of material substances.\n\nThere are 3,888 Christians in the District, of whom 3,606 are natives. The Roman Catholics and Wesleyans have stations at Chikmugalur and visit other parts.\n\nAlong the south of the Baba Budan mountains is a rich tract of black cotton soil, whose fertility, enhanced by the command of an unfailing supply of water from the hill streams, is said formerly to have given to the plain of Chikmugalur the name of Honjavanege Sime, or 'land flowing with gold.' The higher tracts of this region are generally gravelly. Black cotton soil prevails also in the neighbourhood of Ajjampur, together with red and gravelly soils. The western parts of Tarikere contain sandy and gravelly soils. About Yegate the earth seems poor and has a white chalky appearance. Farther south the soil is adapted to the cultivation of the coco-nut without irrigation, as in the adjoining parts of Tumkur and Chitaldroog Districts. The soil of the Malnad bears a general...\nresemblance to that of the same region extending through the neighbouring Districts north and south.\n\nThe following table gives statistics of cultivation for 1903-4:\n\n| Taluk | Total | Cultivated | Irrigated | Forests | Cultivable waste |\n|-------|-------|------------|-----------|---------|-----------------|\n| Kadur | 536   | 202        | 17        | 1       | 85              |\n| Chikmugalur | 609   | 144        | 42        | 85      | 22              |\n| Mudgere | 426   | 80         | 35        | 4       | 9               |\n| Koppa  | 658   | 82         | 51        | 118     | 18              |\n| Tarikere | 460   | 178        | 18        | 57      | 25              |\n| **Total** | **2,689** | **686**    | **163**   | **265** | **159**         |\n\nIn addition to the ordinary cereals, pulses, and oilseeds, the following crops call for special notice. The areca gardens, which occupy the moist and sheltered valleys throughout the west, produce the best description of nut in the country, that of Kalasa and its neighbourhood being in especially high repute. The coffee cultivation of Southern India had its origin in this District. It was first introduced by B\u0101b\u0101 Budan in the seventeenth century on his return from a pilgrimage to Mecca, when he planted a few berries he had brought with him near his hut on the hills that bear his name. But it was not till 1820 that the cultivation extended beyond his garden, and not till twenty years later that European enterprise was first attracted to it. The original plants then put in by Mr. Cannon to the south of B\u0101b\u0101-Budan-giri are still flourishing. Land was soon after taken up for coffee in South Manjar\u0101b\u0101d, and since 1860 European planters have settled in almost a continuous chain of estates throughout the Maln\u0101d. The coffee zone in this District is estimated to cover about 1,000 square miles. The cardamom grows wild in the same parts, but owing to the extension of coffee estates it is no longer plentiful except in the Kalasa and Melbang\u0101di m\u0101ganis. Its systematic cultivation has been taken up in some parts with success. Experiments made with cinchona, tea, cotton, and mulberry have not been successful. The area occupied by the various crops in 1903-4 was: r\u0101gi, 172 square miles; rice, 153; coffee, 123; gram, 42; other food-grains, 67; garden produce, 26; oilseeds, 22.\n\nDuring the twelve years ending 1904 there was advanced for land improvements Rs. 14,500, and for irrigation wells Rs. 7,300.\n\nThe area irrigated from channels is 12 square miles, from tanks 54, and from other sources 97. The number of tanks is 4,394, of which 103 are classed as 'major.'\n\nThe west of the District contains some of the best forests in the\nState. The Lakvalli teak forests have for many years supplied Western Mysore and the Bellary country with that timber. Throughout the J\u00e4gar valley and most of the Koppa and Mudgere taluks, a continuous stretch of valuable forest densely clothes the hill-sides, giving shelter to much coffee cultivation. The State forests cover an area of 144 square miles, 'reserved' lands 124, and plantations 144. The forest receipts in 1903-4 were Rs. 2,98,000, chiefly from sandal-wood.\n\nGold-mining was begun near Ajjampur by the Kad\u00fbr-Mysore Company, but owing to the poor prospects has been suspended. Iron ore is obtained largely and smelted along the hills east of the B\u00e2b\u00e2 Budan range, and round Ubr\u00e2ni. Corundum is found in abundance near Kad\u00fbr and throughout the east.\n\nThe principal articles manufactured are oils and oil-cake, cotton piece-goods, woollen blankets, and glass bangles. Jaggery is also made, and there is some production of iron. A certain amount of catechu or terra japonica is prepared. There are reported to be 300 looms for cotton, 400 for wool, 87 oil-mills, and 201 jaggery and sugar-mills.\n\nThe most important exports are coffee, pepper, cardamons, rice and other food-grains, and oilseeds. It is only a quarter of a century since the Maln\u00e2d began to be opened up by a network of roads, and only since 1889 that the railway has run through a small part of the District. These agencies must certainly effect considerable changes in trade and the transport of commodities. The principal traffic between the Maln\u00e2d and Maid\u00e2n taluks was formerly through five kanaves or passes: namely, Talagudde, Talamakki, Birnahalli, Gantevin\u00e2yakan, and Sitalmallapan.\n\nThe Southern Mahratta Railway from Bangalore to Poona runs through the east of the District, with a branch from Bir\u00fbr north-west to Shimoga, the total length of line being 62 miles. Provincial roads have a length of 259 miles, and District fund roads of 493 miles.\n\nThere has been no general famine in the District since that of 1876-8, but the areca gardens have suffered occasionally in periods of drought.\n\nThe District is divided into five taluks: Chikmugal\u00fbr, Kad\u00fbr, Koppa (including Sringeri j\u00e4gir), Mudgere, and Tarikere. The following subdivisions were formed in 1903, and placed under Assistant Commissioners: Chikmugal\u00fbr and Mudgere; Kad\u00fbr, Tarikere, and Koppa, with head-quarters at Chikmugal\u00fbr.\n\nThe District court at Shimoga has jurisdiction over the whole of this District, and the Subordinate Judge's court over a part. There is a Subordinate Judge's court at Chikmugal\u00fbr for the remaining part, and a Munsif's court at Yadehalli.\nThe land revenue and total revenue are shown below, in thousands of rupees:\n\n|                | 1880-1 | 1890-1 | 1900-1 | 1903-4 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Land revenue   | 6,92   | 7,73   | 8,42   | 8,11   |\n| Total revenue  | 9,13   | 12,27  | 14,46  | 15,55  |\n\nThe revenue survey and settlement were introduced into the east of the District in 1877-8, and into the west in 1880-1. The incidence of land revenue per acre of cultivated area in 1903-4 was Rs. 1-12-10. The average assessment per acre on 'dry' land is Rs. 1-13-1 (maximum scale Rs. 2-10-0, minimum scale Rs. 0-0-6); on 'wet' land, Rs. 3-4-0 (maximum scale Rs. 8-8-0, minimum scale Rs. 0-1-0); on garden land, Rs. 7-4-2 (maximum scale Rs. 18, minimum scale Rs. 1-8-0).\n\nThere were eight municipalities in 1903-4\u2014Chikmugalur, Tarikere, Birur, Kadur, Yedehalli, Mudgere, Koppa, and Sringeri\u2014with a total income of Rs. 57,000 and an expenditure of Rs. 66,000. There were also two village Unions, Ajampur and Sakkarepatna, whose income and expenditure were Rs. 2,000 and Rs. 7,000. The District and taluk boards had an income of Rs. 50,000 in 1903-4, chiefly derived from a share of the Local fund cess, and spent Rs. 49,000, including Rs. 33,000 on roads and buildings.\n\nThe strength of the police force in 1903-4 was one superior officer, 60 subordinate officers, and 381 constables. There were 7 lock-ups, containing a daily average of 16 prisoners.\n\nIn 1901 the percentage of literate persons was 5.9 (10.5 males, 0.6 females). The number of schools increased from 201 with 5,130 pupils in 1890-1 to 292 with 7,324 pupils in 1900-1. In 1903-4 there were 207 schools (95 public and 112 private) with 4,936 pupils, of whom 692 were girls.\n\nBesides the civil hospital at Chikmugalur, there are 14 dispensaries, in which 111,882 patients were treated in 1904, of whom 700 were in-patients, the number of beds available being 36 for men and 22 for women. The total expenditure was Rs. 33,000.\n\nThe number of persons vaccinated in 1904 was 4,723, or 13 per 1,000 of the population.\n\nKadur Taluk.\u2014Eastern taluk of Kadur District, Mysore, lying between 13\u00b0 19' and 13\u00b0 50' N. and 75\u00b0 51' and 76\u00b0 22' E., with an area of 571 square miles. The population in 1901 was 80,904, compared with 72,217 in 1891. The taluk contains three towns, Birur (population, 5,701), Kadur (3,881), the head-quarters, and Sakkarepatna (1,884); and 317 villages. An area of 25 square miles was transferred to Chitadroog District in 1902-3. The land revenue demand in 1903-4 was Rs. 1,75,000. On the west lies the complicated\nmass of hills (Sakunagiri, 4,653 feet) east of the B\u0101b\u0101 Budans, and on the east the Garudangiri (3,680 feet) group. The Ved\u0101vati river runs through the middle in a north-easterly direction. It is formed by the junction of the Veda and Avati, which rise in the B\u0101b\u0101 Budans, the former supplying the Ayyankere, and the latter the Madagakere, the two largest tanks in this part of the country. Numerous channels are taken off from dams across these streams, forming an irrigated tract of great fertility. The annual rainfall averages 22 inches. Most of the taluk is a slightly undulating plain. The waste lands are covered with wild date or bab\u016bl trees, and a considerable area is reserved for grazing, supporting a large number of cattle and sheep. Superior tobacco is grown in the south and west. Coco-nuts are grown without irrigation in low sandy soils. Iron ore is obtained from Hogaribetta in the north-west.\n\nKadus.\u2014An Upper Burmese tribe inhabiting the central portion of the watershed that separates the Irrawaddy from the Chindwin river. In 1901 the tribe numbered 34,629, nearly all of whom were inhabitants of Kath\u0101 District. The origin of the Kadus is doubtful; but, judging by their language and habitat, it seems probable that they are descendants of hill tribes who have intermarried with the surrounding Shan and Burman population and have by some means acquired a tribal identity of their own. Their speech is a mixture of Burmese, Shan, and Kachin, but is now gradually dropping out of use, and will doubtless soon become obsolete. In dress the Kadus used to differ somewhat from their neighbours; but only the elder women now adhere to the tribal costume, which consists of a wholly black or dark-blue jacket, petticoat, and head-cloth. Burmese dress has become almost universal. The practice of staining the teeth of the women appears to have been followed in the past, but the custom is dying out. The Kadus are Buddhists. They have two main subdivisions, known as the Apwa (male) and the Amu (female), but the distinction has been obliterated by intermarriage. They are believed to be connected with the Saks or Thets, an almost extinct tribe of Arakan. It is possible that they are allied to the Tamans, a probably hybrid tribe of the Upper Chindwin District.\n\nK\u0101firist\u0101n (literally, \u2018the country of the infidels\u2019).\u2014A mountainous region in Afgh\u0101nist\u0101n, lying due north of Jal\u0101lab\u0101d, in which district it is now included. Its approximate area is about 5,000 square miles. Its boundaries are the Hindu Kush on the north; the eastern watershed of the Bashgal on the east; the Kunar valley and the K\u0101bul country on the south; and on the west the ranges above the Nijrao and Panjshir valleys. K\u0101firist\u0101n consists of an irregular series of main valleys, for the most part deep, narrow, and tortuous, into which a number of ravines and glens pour their torrents. The hills separating\nthe main valleys one from the other are of considerable altitude, rugged, and difficult. As a consequence, during the winter, K\u0101firist\u0101n consists practically of a number of separate communities with no means of communication with one another. The country appears to be divided into three main drainage systems\u2014those of the Kao or Aling\u0101r; of the Pech or K\u0101nah, named after the important pass of that name; and of the Bashgal. All these streams ultimately find their way into the K\u0101bul river.\n\nIn K\u0101firist\u0101n every kind of mountain scenery is to be met with. At the lower elevations the hill-sides are covered with wild olives and evergreen oaks. Fruit trees abound\u2014the walnut, mulberry, apricot, apple, and vine\u2014while splendid horse chestnuts and other trees offer pleasant shade in the hot season. As one ascends, the fruit trees disappear, being replaced by dense pine and cedar forests. These in their turn cease\u2014the hills above 9,000 feet are almost bare\u2014but the willow, birch, and juniper cedar are found. Above 13,000 feet no vegetation exists, except rough grasses and mosses. The rivers teem with fish, which, however, no K\u0101fir will eat. The chief wild animals are the m\u0101rkhor, the urial, leopards, and bears.\n\nWith the exception of a short visit to the upper part of the Bashgal valley by Colonel Lockhart\u2019s mission in September, 1885, and of Sir George Robertson\u2019s two visits in 1889 and 1890\u20131, the country has not been penetrated by any Europeans in modern times. The people of the country, styled K\u0101firs (\u2018infidels\u2019) by their orthodox Afgh\u0101n neighbours, were known to the emperor B\u0101bar as the Si\u0101hposh (\u2018wearers of black raiment\u2019). They comprise several more or less inimical tribes, differing from one another in language, dress, manners, and customs; and even their primitive pagan religion afforded no bond of common union. This was a somewhat low form of idolatry, with an admixture of ancestor cult and traces of fire-worship. Their total number probably does not exceed 60,000. Until recent years these mysterious people were popularly supposed to be a fair race, noted for their beauty, and of Graeco-Bactrian origin. As a matter of fact they are by no means fair, their colour being that of the average native of the Punjab; their usual type of feature is good; but their beauty, like many other ideas concerning them, is a myth. Sir George Robertson considers that the present dominant races of K\u0101firist\u0101n are mainly descended from the old Indian population of Eastern Afgh\u0101nist\u0101n, who refused to embrace Isl\u0101m in the tenth century, and fled for refuge from the victorious Moslems to the hills. Dr. Grierson, however, holds that the K\u0101fir dialects (which Dr. Trumpp considered to be a \u2018pure Pr\u0101krit\u2019) belong to the non-Sanskritic languages of the Indo-Aryan family, and that \u2018the speakers of these appear to have arrived at their present seats from the north, and not to be colonists\nfrom the south, where that form of Indo-Aryan language which we call Sanskrit became developed.\n\nWhatever their origin, the K\u0101firs, except in the case of the outlying S\u0101f\u012bs (see Jal\u0101l\u0101b\u0101d), succeeded in resisting all attempts at conversion until the reign of the late Amir, when Afgh\u0101n troops overran the country, and brought about its complete subjection. With the exception of the R\u0101mgulis, who held out for a considerable period, the K\u0101firs, who were ill-armed, made but a feeble resistance, and have accepted the Muhammadan religion with little demur. A very small garrison of Afgh\u0101n troops now suffices to keep the country in order.\n\nThere is a small slave population, who are perhaps the remnant of more ancient people subjugated by the lately dominant tribe. The affairs of a tribe are nominally arranged by a consultation of headmen who are known as jast; but, as a matter of fact, in ordinary times, public business falls into the hands of a few elders. Disobedience to the jast is punished by burning down the offender\u2019s house and destroying his property. Theft is punishable by a fine of seven or eight times the value of the stolen property, but the full penalty is seldom exacted. The punishment for adultery is a fine in cows varying from three to six. It is in consequence not uncommon for women to endeavour to entangle men in order to get cows for their husbands. Murder and manslaughter are punished alike. The offender must at once leave his village and become a chile or outcast. His house is burnt by the dead man\u2019s family or clan and his property plundered; he must nevermore return to his village except by stealth; and whenever he encounters a member of the dead man\u2019s family he must at once conceal himself. This stigma applies not only to the criminal himself, but to his direct descendants and to his children-in-law. There are several villages in K\u0101firist\u0101n which are places of refuge, where slayers of their fellow-tribesmen reside permanently.\n\nK\u0101fir women are practically slaves, being to all intents and purposes bought and sold as household commodities. The young women are mostly immoral. There is little or no ceremony about a K\u0101fir marriage. If a man becomes enamoured of a girl, he sends a friend to her father to ask her price. If a price is agreed upon, the man immediately proceeds to the girl\u2019s house, where a goat is sacrificed, and then they are considered to be married, though the bride remains with her parents until the full price has been paid. The dead are disposed of in a peculiar manner. They are not buried, or burnt, but are deposited in large boxes, placed on the hill-side or in some more or less secluded spot.\n\nK\u0101firkot.\u2014Ruins in Dera Ismail Kh\u0101n District, North-West Frontier Province, situated in $32^\\circ 30' N.$ and $71^\\circ 21' E.$ The site is also known\n\n1 Report on the Census of India, 1901, chap. vii.\nas Til K\u0101firkot or R\u0101j\u0101 Sir-kot, and lies a few miles south of the point where the Kurram river joins the Indus, upon a spur of the Khisor hills. The remains consist of extensive lines of bastioned walls built of solid masonry, enclosing an area filled with the d\u00e9bris of ancient dwellings. The remains of four small Hindu temples are relatively well preserved, and their outer faces are decorated with elaborate carvings of stone. For some details see A. Cunningham, Archaeological Survey Reports, vol. xiv, pp. 26, 254, and Dr. Stein's Archaeological Survey Report of the North-West Frontier Province and Baluchist\u0101n (1903\u20135). A similar ruin of the same name exists at Bilot, about 30 miles due south.\n\nK\u0101gal State.\u2014Native State feudatory to the Kolh\u0101pur State, within the Political Agency of Kolh\u0101pur and the Southern Mar\u0101th\u0101 Country, Bombay, lying between 16\u00b0 30' and 16\u00b0 35' N. and 74\u00b0 20' and 74\u00b0 25' E. See Kolh\u0101pur State.\n\nK\u0101gal Town.\u2014Chief town of the feudatory j\u0101g\u012br of the same name in Kolh\u0101pur State, Bombay, situated in 16\u00b0 34' N. and 74\u00b0 20' E., 10 miles south-east of Kolh\u0101pur city. It lies in the valley of the Dudhganga about a mile south of the river, surrounded by rich garden land and shaded by fine old mango-trees. Population (1901), 7,688. There are ruins of mosques and temples. The old fort was destroyed by Jaswant Rao Sindhia of Kolh\u0101pur in 1780, and a new fort was built about 1813 by Hindu Rao Ghatge. Of the public buildings lately raised at a cost of about one lakh, the most important are three large resthouses, three temples, one of which contains the k\u0101rbh\u0101ri's office, and water-works from which pipes supply the town reservoirs with water. Every year in K\u0101rtik (October\u2013November) a fair is held in honour of Gaibi Pir, at which the chief spends about Rs. 2,000. The fair is attended by 10,000 people from Kolh\u0101pur and the neighbouring villages.\n\nK\u0101g\u0101n (Kh\u0101g\u0101n).\u2014Mountain valley in Haz\u0101ra District, North-West Frontier Province, penetrating far into the heart of the Him\u0101layan system, and surrounded by Kashm\u012br territory on every side except the south. The valley has an area of 800 square miles, and is 60 miles in length, with an average breadth of 15 miles. Lofty ranges shut it in on either hand, their summits rising to a height of 17,000 feet. Transverse spurs intersect the valley, which is inhabited by a sparse population. K\u0101g\u0101n comprises twenty-two rakhs or forest and grazing Reserves, with a total area of 90 square miles, while the area of 'reserved' and unreserved forest is 457 square miles. The rights of cutting grass and grazing cattle are leased out annually. The Forest department only fells timber, which is launched into the river Kunh\u0101r, caught at different timber d\u00e9p\u00f4ts, and rafted to Jhelum. The river Kunh\u0101r forces its way through a narrow central gorge to join the Jhelum after draining the entire valley. The K\u0101g\u0101n valley forms the northernmost extension of\nBritish India, and stretches far up into the mountain region. Its open mouth turns towards the main body of Haz\u0101ra District. The inhabitants consist almost entirely of Muhammadan Sw\u0101tis and G\u016bjars. K\u0101g\u0101n village is situated in $34^\\circ 46' N.$ and $75^\\circ 34' E.$\n\n**Kahalgaon.**\u2014Town in Bh\u0101galpur District, Bengal. See Colgong.\n\n**Kahl\u016br.**\u2014One of the Simla Hill States, Punjab. See Bil\u0101spur.\n\n**Kahnaur.**\u2014Town in the District and tahsil of Rohtak, Punjab, situated in $28^\\circ 45' N.$ and $76^\\circ 32' E.$, 11 miles south of Rohtak town and 15 miles north-west of Jhajjar. Population (1901), 5,024.\n\n**Kahror.**\u2014Town in the Lodhr\u0101n tahsil of Mult\u0101n District, Punjab, situated in $29^\\circ 37' N.$ and $71^\\circ 56' E.$, on an old bed of the Be\u0101s known as the Bhat\u0101ri nullah, about 8 miles from the present right bank of the Sutlej. Population (1901), 5,552. Being built on undulating ground, it is more picturesque than most Punjab towns. The town is said to have been founded by Kailun, chief of Jaisalmer, at the end of the fourteenth century; its identification with the Kar\u016br where Vikram\u0101ditya is said to have defeated the White Huns is extremely doubtful. The most remarkable building in the town is the shrine of Ali Sarwar, a Saiyid of Delhi, who came to Kahror in 1204. The municipality was created in 1867. The income and expenditure during the ten years ending 1902\u20133 averaged Rs. 4,000. In 1903\u20134 the income was Rs. 4,300, chiefly from octroi; and the expenditure was Rs. 4,100. The town has a vernacular middle school, maintained by the municipality, and a dispensary. It is the trade centre for the Sutlej tahsils of the District, dealing especially in wool, piece-goods, and wheat, and has a local reputation for the manufacture of coverlets of hand-printed cotton.\n\n**Kah\u016bta.**\u2014Eastern tahsil of R\u0101walpindi District, Punjab, lying in the Lower Him\u0101layas, between $33^\\circ 18' N.$ and $33^\\circ 48' N.$ and $73^\\circ 15' E.$ and $73^\\circ 39' E.$, with an area of 457 square miles. Its eastern border rests upon the Jhelum river. The whole of the tahsil except the southwest corner lies in the hills, which in the north reach an elevation of over 6,000 feet. The population in 1901 was 94,729, compared with 92,372 in 1891. It contains 231 villages, of which Kah\u016bta is the head-quarters. The land revenue and cesses amounted in 1903\u20134 to 1\u00b72 lakhs.\n\n**Kaij.**\u2014Former taluk of Bh\u012br District, Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State.

See Kelw\u0101r\u0101.\n\n**Kaimganj Tahsil.**\u2014North-western tahsil of Farrukh\u0101b\u0101d District, United Provinces, comprising the parganas of Kampil and Shams\u0101b\u0101d.\nWest, and lying along the southern bank of the Ganges, between $27^\\circ 21'$ and $27^\\circ 43'$ N. and $79^\\circ 8'$ and $79^\\circ 37'$ E., with an area of 363 square miles. Population increased from 143,557 in 1891 to 168,606 in 1901. There are 397 villages and two towns: Kaimganj (population, 10,369), the tahsil head-quarters, and Shamsabad (8,375). The demand for land revenue in 1903-4 was Rs. 2,10,000, and for cesses Rs. 36,000. The density of population, 464 persons per square mile, is below the District average. The tahsil contains a larger tract of lowland than any other in the District except Aligarh; but the greater part of it is situated in the uplands. The Bagar river winds through the southern portion, and on either bank stretches a wide expanse of sandy land, which extends on the north to near Kampil. North and west of this is a belt of fine yellowish loam, tilled by Kurmis, and famous for its sugar-cane, and near the towns of Kampil, Kaimganj, and Shamsabad for its tobacco, which acquires a special flavour from the brackish water of the wells. The area under cultivation in 1903-4 was 226 square miles, of which 72 were irrigated. The Fategarh branch of the Lower Ganges Canal supplies irrigation through the centre of the uplands, and the area irrigated from canals is slightly larger than that supplied by wells. There are several considerable swamps, from which water is also taken; but a good deal has been done to improve the drainage.\n\n**Kaimganj Town.**\u2014Head-quarters of the tahsil of the same name in Farrukhabad District, United Provinces, situated in $27^\\circ 30'$ N. and $79^\\circ 21'$ E., on the Cawnpore-Achhnera Railway, and also at the terminus of a metalled road from Farrukhabad city. Population (1901), 10,369. It was founded in 1713 by Muhammad Khan, first Nawab of Farrukhabad, who named it after his son, Kaim Khan. It is the centre of a group of villages inhabited by a colony of Pathans who settled here early in the seventeenth century. The best known of these villages is Mau Rashidabad, now a great tobacco field, about a mile north of Kaimganj. The Pathans of this neighbourhood are still noted for the number of men they supply to the native army. In 1857 the tahsil was ineffectually besieged for a time by a band of fugitive insurgents from Kalpi. The town consists chiefly of a wide metalled bazar, about a mile long, from which branch many narrow unmetalled lanes. It contains a tahsil, munsif, and dispensary. Kaimganj is administered under Act XX of 1856, with an income of about Rs. 2,000. There is a considerable trade in tobacco, which is largely grown in the neighbourhood. The old manufacture of swords and matchlocks has dwindled down to a trade in ordinary knives and betel-nut cutters. The town school has 193 pupils, and three primary schools 63.\n\n**Kaimur Hills.**\u2014The eastern portion of the Vindhyan range, commencing near Katangi in Jubbulpore District of the Central Provinces\n(23\u00b0 26' N. and 79\u00b0 48' E.). It runs a little north of east for more than 300 miles to Sasaram in Bihar (24\u00b0 57' N. and 84\u00b0 2' E). The range, after traversing the north of Jubbulpore District and the southeast of Maihar State, turns to the east and runs through Rewah territory, separating the valleys of the Son and Tons rivers, and continues into Mirzapur District of the United Provinces and Shahabad of Bengal. Its maximum width is 50 miles. In the Central Provinces the appearance of the range is very distinctive. The rock formation is metamorphic and the strata have been upheaved into an almost vertical position, giving the range the appearance of a sharp ridge. In places the range almost disappears, being marked only by a low rocky chain, and in this portion it never rises more than a few hundred feet above the plain. The range enters Central India at Jukehi in Maihar State (23\u00b0 29' N. and 80\u00b0 27' E.), and runs for 150 miles in a north-easterly direction, forming the northern wall of the Son valley and overhanging the river in a long bold scarp of sandstone rock, from which near Govindgarh a branch turns off to the north-west. The range here attains an elevation of a little over 2,000 feet. In Mirzapur the height of the range decreases in the centre, to rise again to over 2,000 feet at the rock of Bijaigarh with its ancient fort. Interesting relics of prehistoric man have been found in the caves and rock-shelters of the hills here, in the form of rude drawings and stone implements. In Shahabad District the summit of the hills consists of a series of saucer-shaped valleys, each a few miles in diameter, containing a deposit of rich vegetable mould in the centre and producing the finest crops. The general height of the plateau is here 1,500 feet above sea-level. The sides are precipitous, but there are several passes, some of which are practicable for beasts of burden. The ruined fort of Rohtas is situated on these hills. The rocks throughout consist principally of sandstones and shales.\n\nKain.\u2014River in Bundelkhand. See Ken.\n\nKaintira.\u2014Village in Athmallik, one of the Orissa Tributary States, Bengal, situated in 20\u00b0 43' N. and 84\u00b0 32' E., on the north bank of the Mahanadi. Population (1901), 1,567. Kaintira is the principal village in the State and contains the residence of the chief.\n\nKaira District (Kheda).\u2014District in the Northern Division of the Bombay Presidency, lying between 22\u00b0 14' and 23\u00b0 7' N. and 72\u00b0 30' and 73\u00b0 23' E., with an area of 1,595 square miles. It is bounded on the north by Ahmadabad District, Mahi Kantha, and the small State of Balasinor in the Rewa Kantha Agency; on the west by Ahmadabad District and the State of Cambay; on the south and east by the river Mahi and the Gaikwar's territory (Baroda). The breadth of the District varies from 25 to 40 miles.\n\nExcepting a small corner of hilly ground near its northern boundary,\nand in the south-east and south, where the land along the Mah\u012b is furrowed into deep ravines, Kaira forms one unbroken plain sloping gently towards the south-west. The north and north-east portions are dotted with patches of rich rice land, broken by untilled tracts of low brushwood.\n\nThe centre of the District, called the charotar, or 'goodly' land, is very fertile and highly cultivated; the luxuriant fields are surrounded by high-growing hedges, and the whole country is clothed with clusters of large shapely trees. Westward, this belt of rich vegetation passes into a bare though well-cultivated tract of rice land, growing more barren and open to the south till it reaches the maritime belt, whitened by a salt-like crust, on the Gulf of Cambay.\n\nThe Mah\u012b, the largest river of Kaira, and the third in importance of the Gujar\u0101t rivers, flows for nearly 100 miles along the east, south-east, and south boundary of the District. This 100 miles may be divided into three sections: first a stretch of 40 miles over a rough and rocky bed, then 10 miles of a still stream with a sandy bed, and lastly 45 miles of a tidal river. The fords in the District are at K\u0101vi, Dehv\u0101n, Gajna, Kh\u0101npur, and Ometa. At Ver\u0101kh\u0101ndi, the limit of the flow of the tide, the bed is in the dry season 500 yards wide, the stream 120 yards, and the average depth 1\u00bd feet. A small 'bore' rises in the estuary at springs and dashes itself on the Dehv\u0101n. The S\u0101barmat\u012b, the fourth largest river in Gujar\u0101t, flows for 14 miles along the western boundary, and is much used for irrigation. The Shedhi, the chief drainage line of the plain between the Mah\u012b and the S\u0101barmat\u012b, being charged with soda, is not adapted for irrigation. The Kh\u0101ri, one of five smaller streams, waters a large area by means of canals and sluices, but fails at the end of the rice season, that is to say about November.\n\nThe District has not yet been geologically surveyed in any detail. The Kaira plain is, with the exception of the few sandy hills and rocks in Kapadvanj and Th\u0101sra, a deep bed of alluvium, most of it the d\u00e9bris of the gneiss and metamorphic limestones of the Ar\u0101valli Hills. In the raised tract along the banks of the Mah\u012b, water is found only at a depth of from 80 to 110 feet. Away from the river, wells have their springs from 40 to 60 feet deep, rising through strata of earth mixed with limestone nodules, alternating with sand overlying layers of limestone. From this limestone, when tapped, water rises to within 25 feet of the surface. The age of these strata is not known. They may be Tertiary or Cretaceous. Formerly, in parts of the District, water was to be found at a higher level. Many old wells are said to have been made useless by the earthquake of 1819, which lowered all the springs from 5 to 10 cubits. In some cases deeper sinking has overcome the evil: in others, a fine stratum of quicksand makes farther cutting dangerous. The hot springs of Lasundra, 10 miles south-east of Kapadvanj, rise to\nthe surface in ten or twelve cisterns, the hottest reaching a temperature of $115^\\circ$. Like those at Tuva in Godhra, 20 miles to the south-east, and at An\u0101val, 150 miles south, the Lasundra springs are slightly sulphurous, and thought to be useful in skin diseases.\n\nThe District has no forests or forest lands, the trees either standing singly or in small groves. In the north the mahu\u0101 (Bassia latifolia), and in the south the mango and the limbdo or nim (Melia Azadirachta), are the commonest kinds, while the custard-apple, sit\u0101phal (Anona squamosa), is abundant all over the District. The r\u012byan (Mimosa hexandra), the kanaj (Ulmus integrifolia), the karanj or kaniji (Pongamia glabra), and the aduso (Ailanthus excelsa), also occur freely distributed. Mangoes are sent in considerable quantities to Baroda, Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d, and Kathi\u0101war. During the hot season the fleshy corolla of the mahu\u0101 flower is eaten by the poorer classes and by cattle, and from it is distilled a favourite liquor. Mixed with whey, the berries of the r\u012byan form, during the hot season, the staple food of a large section of the Kol\u012b population.\n\nTigers and leopards, which haunted the bed of the Mahi till a few years ago, are now rarely heard of, owing to the spread of tillage and their pursuit by European sportsmen. Hyenas, jackals, foxes, wild hog, antelope, gazelle, and hares are common. Of game-birds, snipe, quail, and many species of duck abound; while geese, bustard, partridge, and florican may occasionally be shot. Poisonous snakes are common. Mahseer and other fresh-water fish are caught in the waters of the larger rivers.\n\nTo Europeans the climate is trying. From November to March the air is pleasant and bracing. By the people of the District the charotar or central portion is considered healthy. The rainfall varies but slightly in different parts of the District. The annual fall is 38 inches in the Nadi\u0101d, Borsad, and Anand t\u016blukas, while it averages about 34 inches over the whole District. The average temperature is $82^\\circ$, the maximum being $116^\\circ$ and the minimum $43^\\circ$.\n\nKaira District is made up partly of lands acquired from the Peshw\u0101 in 1802 by the Treaty of Bassein, partly of territory transferred by the Gaikw\u0101r of Baroda in 1803 and 1817. R\u0101jputs reigned in Kaira from 746 to 1290, and, excepting perhaps Th\u0101sra and Kapadvanj, the District formed part of the directly managed portions of Anhilv\u0101da. At the end of the fourteenth century Kaira passed to the Muhammadan kings of Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d, and in 1573 was transferred to the Mughals. In 1720 the Mar\u0101th\u0101s appeared, and from that time to the fall of Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d in 1752 the District was the scene of perpetual struggles between the Mar\u0101th\u0101s and the Muhammadan viceroys. The Mar\u0101th\u0101s were victorious, and in 1753 the District was shared between the Peshw\u0101 and the Gaikw\u0101r.\nPart of Kaira came into British possession in 1803, and the rest in 1817. Under the terms of the Treaty of Bassein (December 31, 1802), the N\u0101p\u0101d group of villages was handed over by the Peshw\u0101. In 1803 the Gaikw\u0101r ceded Nadi\u0101d, M\u0101tar, and Mahudha, as well as the fort and town of Kaira, for the maintenance of troops supplied by the British Government. Again, by treaty dated November 6, 1817, the Gaikw\u0101r ceded Mehmad\u0101b\u0101d, Al\u012bna, Th\u0101sra, Antroli, and half of the town and district of Petl\u0101d to provide for the payment of additional troops. At the same time, Kapadvanj and Bh\u0101laj were received in exchange for the district of Bij\u0101pur in Northern Gujar\u0101t.\n\nThe territories acquired in 1803, together with Dholka, Dhandhuka, R\u0101npur, and Gogha, which now form part of Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d District, remained in charge of the Resident at Baroda from the date of their cession till May, 1805. During this time a European Assistant and native officers administered, according to local usage, the police and justice of the country. In 1805 a Collector was appointed, with jurisdiction over the ceded tracts, both those to the north of the Mah\u012b and those to the west of the Gulf of Cambay. In the same year the town of Kaira was selected as a large military station. The increase in the British possessions consequent on the treaty of November, 1817, necessitated fresh administrative arrangements. The territory north of the Mah\u012b was, from January 1, 1818, divided into the two Districts of Kaira and Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d. In 1830 Kapadvanj was included in Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d, and Kaira became a sub-collectorate under the Collector of Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d. In 1833 Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d and Kaira were again separated. Since then, more than once, villages have been transferred from one District to the other, and the original irregular groups and collections of villages have been gradually consolidated into seven t\u0101lukas.\n\nThroughout the District are Hindu and Musalm\u0101n buildings of interest. The rauza of Mub\u0101rak Saiyid (died A.H. 966) at Soj\u0101le is one of the finest of the latter. Kapadvanj contains some buildings of great antiquity: a beautiful arch described by Forbes in his R\u0101s M\u0101l\u0101, a kund or basin of consecrated water, a mosque, and a well; and an underground temple of Mah\u0101deo which has recently been explored for the first time. It is also remarkable for a fine Jain temple recently built.\n\nIn 1846 the population of Kaira District was returned at 566,513. By 1872 it had risen to 782,938. In 1881 the population was 805,005; in 1891, 871,794; and in 1901, 716,332.\n\nPopulation. The decrease of 18 per cent. during the last decade was due to the famine and cholera of 1899-1900. The District is divided into 7 t\u0101lukas, with area and population (1901) as given in the table on the next page.\n\nThe number of towns in the District in 1901 was 11, and of villages 598. The chief towns are Nadi\u0101d, Kapadvanj, Kaira (the\nhead-quarters), Anand, and Mehmadabad. Owing to the large fertile areas which the District comprises, it is the most thickly populated in the Presidency. The most populous talukas are Nadiad, Borsad, and Anand. Gujarati is the vernacular. Classified according to religion, Hindus in 1901 numbered 614,146, or 85 per cent. of the total: Muhammadans, 68,187, or 9 per cent.; Christians, 25,210; Jains, 8,469; and Parsis, 209.\n\n| Taluka     | Area in square miles | Number of | Population | Population per square mile | Percentage of variation in population between 1891 and 1901 | Number of persons able to read and write |\n|------------|----------------------|-----------|------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Kapadvanj  | 279                  | 1         | 87         | 75,258                    | 270                                                      | 5,591                                  |\n| Mehmadabad | 171                  | 2         | 66         | 75,926                    | 444                                                      | 7,007                                  |\n| Tharsa     | 257                  | 1         | 96         | 73,980                    | 288                                                      | 6,154                                  |\n| Matar      | 216                  | 1         | 81         | 61,522                    | 285                                                      | 4,884                                  |\n| Nadiad     | 224                  | 2         | 91         | 148,452                   | 663                                                      | 16,099                                 |\n| Anand      | 244                  | 3         | 85         | 143,305                   | 587                                                      | 18,336                                 |\n| Borsad     | 204                  | 1         | 92         | 137,889                   | 673                                                      | 12,631                                 |\n| **District total** | **1,595**          | **11**    | **598**    | **716,332**               | **449**                                                  | **70,702**                             |\n\nThe following castes are of importance: Brahmans, 38,000; Vanis, 22,000; Rajputs, 21,000; Chamars, 13,000; Kunbis (agriculturists), 127,000; Kolis (agriculturists), 252,000; Dhers or Mahars, 21,000. The Muhammadans include 16,000 Pathans and 10,000 Bohras.\n\nThe Lewa and Kadya Kunbis are the best farmers in the District, and a sober, peaceable, and industrious race. The Kunbis of certain villages are held in honour as descended from the leading men among the original settlers in Gujarat. The Rajputs, with the exception of a few who, with the title of Thakur, still retain landed estates, have sunk into the mass of ordinary peasant proprietors. The Kolis number 252,000, or 35 per cent. of the total population. Idle and turbulent under native rule, they are now quiet, hard-working, and prosperous. Among Hindu low castes, the Dhers are distinguished for industry and good behaviour. They formerly lived in comfort by weaving coarse cotton cloth, but the competition of the Bombay and local mills is now shutting them out of the market. Of the Musalm\u0101n population, about one-third, under the name of Saiyids, Shaikhs, Pathans, and Mughals, represent the foreign conquerors of Gujarat. The remainder, called Momnas, Bohras, Tais, and Ghanchis, are the descendants of Hindus converted to Isl\u0101m under the Ahmad\u0101bad kings. Musalm\u0101ns of the first class, employed chiefly as cultivators or in Government service as police or messengers, are for the most part poor. Musalm\u0101ns of the second class are artisans, chiefly weavers and oil-pressers, and are hard-working and well-to-do. Most of the population is dependent on\nagriculture, which supports 67 per cent. of the total. General labour supports 4 per cent., and the remainder are distributed between commerce and trade, personal service, &c. Over 15,000 are engaged in cotton-weaving.\n\nAt the Census of 1901 the native Christian population of the District was returned at 25,131, showing an increase of no less than tenfold since 1891. This may to some extent be the result of conversions to Christianity during the famine; but it is noteworthy that the Salvation Army has been active in Kaira for some years, and that a large number of the Christians are Salvationists, mainly converted from the lower classes. Besides the Salvation Army, the following missions are at work in the District: the Irish Presbyterian, with stations at Borsad and Anand, which maintains 2 Anglo-vernacular and 46 vernacular schools, 4 orphanages, and a hospital at Anand, and has settled 14 colonies of converts on waste land procured from Government; the Methodist Episcopal at Nadi\u0101d, which maintains 165 schools, an industrial school, an orphanage, and a dispensary, and which undertook extensive relief operations in the famine of 1900; the Christian Alliance in the M\u0101tar taluka, which maintains 9 schools and an orphanage and industrial school at Kaira; and the Roman Catholic at Anand, which maintains 19 schools, an industrial school, and an orphanage and dispensary. The Salvation Army maintains 112 schools and a well-equipped hospital at Anand, which is very popular among all classes. Kh\u0101siv\u0101di, 'the beautiful garden,' in Borsad town was the first to show a leaning towards Christianity, two families having been converted there in 1847. There is an English church at Kaira known as St. George's Church, established about 1825.\n\nThe soil belongs to four classes: light, medium, black, and alluvial, with subordinate varieties. The light soil is the most common, varying in quality from the loose-grained yellow sand of the fields near the S\u0101barmat\u012b and the Mahi, to a rich lighter mould common in the central talukas, and found to perfection in the south-west corner of M\u0101tar. The medium soil is fairly well distributed over the whole District. The black soil of Kaira is poor and generally contains either soda or limestone. Alluvial soil or bh\u0101tha is found near the V\u0101trak river and is a rich garden mould.\n\nThe greater part of the land of the District is ryotwari (1,075 square miles, or 88 per cent. of the total area), about 7 per cent. being held on udhad or quit-rent tenure. The main statistics of cultivation in 1903-4 are shown in the table on the next page, in square miles.\n\nThe chief crops, with the area under each in square miles (1903-4), are: bijra (313), kodra (162), rice (115), jow\u0101r (91), and wheat (18).\n\nCotton is grown in small patches (10 square miles). The finest tobacco in Western India is grown in Kaira, occupying 24 square\nmiles, mostly in the Nadi\u0101d, Borsad, and Anand talukas; but the cultivators, though skilful in rearing the plant, know nothing of its preparation for the European market. Two varieties of tobacco are grown, the talabdi or local plant and the kh\u0101ndeshi or plant introduced from Kh\u0101ndesh. An irrigated field yields twice as large a crop as a dry one. About the beginning of July, as soon as the first rain has fallen, the seed is sown on a well-prepared plot of ground, and after about a month and a half the seedlings are ready for transplantation. The field is scored in squares by a heavy, long-toothed rake, and at each point of intersection a seedling is set. The plant takes about five and a half months to ripen. As soon as it is ready, it is carefully examined, and divided into two classes, k\u0101li\u014d and jardo; the k\u0101li\u014d is cut down, stalk and all, and laid out to dry; the jardo is left a little longer, and then the leaves are stripped off the stem. A moth caterpillar is the chief enemy of the plant. Tobacco-growing is a costly process, and can be undertaken only by substantial cultivators. It has been calculated that the cost of growing an acre of plant is Rs. 270, and the profit Rs. 110. Cotton is grown only from the local plant, and occupies every seventh furrow in fields sown with ordinary grain crops.\n\n| Taluka     | Total area | Cultivated | Irrigated | Cultivable waste |\n|------------|------------|------------|-----------|-----------------|\n| Kapadvanj  | 279        | 182        | 2         | 45              |\n| Mehmadabad | 171        | 131        | 5         | 13\u00bd             |\n| Th\u0101sra      | 257        | 141        | 2         | 5\u00b2              |\n| M\u0101tar      | 216        | 141        | 3         | 34              |\n| Nadi\u0101d     | 224        | 191        | 10        | 6               |\n| Anand      | 244        | 196        | 4\u00bd        | 2\u00bd              |\n| Borsad     | 204        | 149        | 12        | \u00be               |\n| **Total**  | **1,595**  | **1,131**  | **37**    | **153**         |\n\nThe area for which statistics are not available is 129 square miles.\n\nSeveral attempts have been made to improve the Kaira cotton, but without success. Indigo was once one of the chief exports from Gujar\u0101t, but by 1827 it had almost ceased to be produced. A later attempt to encourage the growth in Kaira was attended with failure. A Government silk garden was started in 1837, but was closed in 1847. The Nadi\u0101d Agricultural Association's small experimental farm has been removed to Kamta, and has practically been handed over to the department of Agriculture, which has enlarged its scope and is providing new buildings. Numerous experiments in the cultivation of tobacco and other staple crops of the District have been made. It has been ascertained in the course of these experiments that a better yield of tobacco is obtained by growing it continuously instead of in rotation, that deep tillage increases the out-turn, and that Sumatra tobacco\ncannot be grown. The desi or local tobacco stands first in quality and quantity, and the Belgaum varieties second. In the ten years ending 1903\u20134, a total of 19-8 lakhs was advanced to cultivators under the Land Improvement and Agriculturists\u2019 Loans Acts, of which 7-7 lakhs was lent in 1899\u20131900, and 8-8 lakhs in 1900\u20131.\n\nCattle are imported from K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r and K\u0101nkrej in Northern Guj\u0101r\u0101t. Some of the largest used to be bred in the District at Bh\u0101laj, and many villages of the Nadi\u0101d t\u0101luka are famous for their bullocks. Ponies are bred in the District, but they are not suitable for cavalry remounts. Two Government pony stallions are maintained by the Civil Veterinary department.\n\nOf the total cultivated area of 1,131 square miles, 37 square miles, or 3 per cent., were irrigated in 1903\u20134. The chief sources of irrigation are 11 minor works, 10,886 wells, and 1,391 tanks. The wells most commonly in use are deep, shallow wells being found only in the M\u0101tar t\u0101luka. The water is drawn up by bullocks in four leathern bags working simultaneously. The ponds are used for irrigating rice lands. After the close of the cold season few of them hold any large supply of water. The Kh\u0101ri sluice system irrigated nearly 8,800 acres in 1903\u20134. In 1902 large reservoirs were constructed at Goblaj, Tranja, Nagrama, and Vangroli by famine labour.\n\nIron ore was at one time worked in the neighbourhood of Kapadvanj. In the bed of the M\u0101jam river, about 15 miles from Kapadvanj, are found varieties of agate and moss-stone. The bed of the Mahi contains masses and boulders of trap; while on its upper course, on the B\u0101l\u0101sinor frontier, rock is plentiful, including trap, with occasional limestone, quartz, and granite.\n\nThe opening of steam factories at Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d and at Nadi\u0101d has greatly reduced the demand for hand-spun cotton, once a staple. The water of the District is thought to be especially good for dyeing purposes. Soap and glass are manufactured at Kapadvanj. A steam spinning-mill, established at Nadi\u0101d in 1876 at a cost of about 5 lakhs, has 14,568 spindles, which turn out over a million pounds of yarn, and employ 584 persons. Considerable quantities of coarse cloth for home consumption are woven in hand-looms by the lower castes of Hindus. In the larger towns calico printing is carried on by classes known as Bhavs\u0101rs and Chhipas.\n\nThe chief exports are prints, grain, tobacco, butter, oil, and mahu\u0101 flowers; the chief imports are piece-goods, grocery, molasses, and dye-stuffs. Kaira is particularly noted for its gh\u012b or clarified butter, the export of which is valued at 8 lakhs. The gh\u012b when made is forced into large leathern bottles holding from 60 to 200 lb.\n\nIn 1884 there was only one made road in the District. There are\nnow 166 miles of metalled and 19 of unmetalled roads. Of the former, 33 miles of Provincial roads and 123 miles of local board roads are maintained by the Public Works department. All the watercourses are bridged except the large rivers, and avenues of trees are maintained along 49 miles. New roads were constructed by famine labour in 1900 from Mehmad\u0101b\u0101d to D\u0101kor and from Borsad to Agas railway station. The whole of the District is connected with Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d city by metalled roads. The main line of the Bombay, Baroda, and Central India Railway passes through the District from north to south for 38 miles, and a branch line from Anand runs through the P\u0101nch Mah\u0101ls to Godhra, where it connects with the Godhra-Ratl\u0101m Railway, traversing the District for 34 miles. In 1890 another branch line was opened from Anand to Petl\u0101d in Baroda territory, and thence in 1901 to Cambay town, thus bringing Kaira into close connexion with the sea. This line traverses the District for 6 miles. Ferries ply across the Mah\u012b.\n\nA severe famine took place in 1791-2, when rain fell only once; in 1813-4 there were only two showers of rain throughout the year; in 1825 the later rains failed, and remissions of land revenue to the amount of over 1\u00bd lakhs were granted. Famine.\n\nOn the other hand, the period 1814-22 was marked by heavy floods and rainfall that caused much damage to the country. In 1834 locusts ate up the crops, and remissions amounting to nearly 2 lakhs were sanctioned. In 1837, 1868, and 1871 disastrous storms swept over the District. During the forty years 1836-76, though the rainfall had at times been scanty and the crops failed, no season of famine or even of general scarcity occurred in Kaira. Owing to the scanty rainfall in 1877 (19\u00b713 inches), there was a partial failure of crops, and the poorer people, especially in the Kapadvanj and Th\u0101sra t\u0101lukas in the north-east, suffered some distress, which, however, did not leave behind serious results. In 1899 the monsoon failed and the District was visited by severe famine. In April of the following year nearly 85,000 persons, exclusive of 8,000 dependants, were on relief works, and 15,000 more received gratuitous relief. The number increased to 143,000 by July of the same year, excluding 13,000 dependants and 38,000 on gratuitous relief. The latter reached a maximum of 113,000 in August. It is calculated that there was, during the three years 1900-2, an increase of 112,464 deaths over the yearly average. The loss of cattle in the year 1899-1900 amounted to 233,000. The cost of relief measures in the District, including the P\u0101nch Mah\u0101ls, was over 88 lakhs. Remissions of land revenue to the amount of 35 lakhs were granted in these two Districts. The loans granted to agriculturists in Kaira alone amounted to 19 lakhs.\n\nThe District is divided into two subdivisions, in charge of an\nAssistant Collector and a Deputy-Collector respectively, and is composed of the seven talukas of Anand, Borsad, Kapadvanj, Matar, Mehmadabad, Nadiad, and Thasra. The Collector is ex-officio Political Agent for Cambay State and Additional Political Agent for Rewa Kantha.\n\nFor judicial purposes the District is included in the jurisdiction of the Judge of Ahmadabad. There are 5 Subordinate Judges for civil work, and 23 officers, including a bench of magistrates, to administer criminal justice. The common offences are murder in Borsad and Anand, and house-breaking, burglary, cattle-stealing, and thefts elsewhere.\n\nIn 1803, when Kaira was ceded to the British, the District afforded examples of various forms of land revenue administration. In the centre were three kinds of villages: rasti or peaceable, mehwais or refractory, and an intermediate class of rasti-mehwais villages. The refractory villages were occupied by the turbulent descendants of the Rajput and Koli warriors. Here Koli thakurs or chiefs administered despotically their little clusters of huts. Revenue was demanded but seldom paid. The peaceable villages were mostly grants from Government to those who had done some public service. The most important Muhammadan grants were called malihi, and were held rent-free. Internal administration was the concern of the village community. There were four forms of village government, the commonest being that by which the village headman engaged annually for the payment of a certain sum to Government. The profits of a good year, under this the most simple and general system, went to the headman; on the other hand, the headman had to bear any loss from failure of crop or short tillage. Above the headman or patel were the revenue-farmers (kamavisdar), who fixed the village contributions; and below the headmen were the cultivators and coparceners of the village. A class quite apart, called manotidars, or money-lenders, arose as sureties for the payment of the revenue. This short statement furnishes an outline of the Maratha revenue system. It had the merit of simplicity and was calculated to ensure the recovery of revenue. At the same time it is clear that it was productive of abuses and suffering to the cultivating classes. When the District was taken over by the British in 1803, the system was continued with but small modification until 1862. In that year the revenue survey system, which deals directly with individual cultivators, was introduced. The result of the survey assessment was to increase the land revenue demand from $11\\frac{1}{2}$ to $13\\frac{1}{4}$ lakhs, or by 11 per cent. In 1894 a resettlement was undertaken and completed in 1896, which further enhanced the total revenue by 17 per cent. The average rates of assessment are: 'dry' land, Rs. 3\u20137 (maximum Rs. 6\u201312, minimum Rs. 1\u20138); rice land, Rs. 5 11 (maximum Rs. 6\u201312,\nminimum Rs. 1\u20138); garden land, Rs. 9\u20139 (maximum Rs. 7, minimum Rs. 5).\n\nCollections of land revenue and total revenue have been as follows in recent years, in thousands of rupees:\n\n|                | 1880-1 | 1890-1 | 1901-2 | 1903-4 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Land revenue   | 19.69  | 19.52  | 10.34  | 18.31  |\n| Total revenue  | 21.65  | 20.06  | 10.69  | 20.73  |\n\nOf the Government villages, 88 are held on the *narv\u0101d\u012bri* tenure. The peculiarity of this tenure is that it involves joint responsibility for the payment of the Government revenue. In *narv\u0101d\u012bri* villages the *p\u0101tid\u0101rs* or sharers belong to the Kunb\u012b caste, and on account of being *narv\u0101d\u0101rs* hold a high position among their fellows, being the descendants of the old proprietary cultivators. This tenure has been preserved by Act V of 1862 of the Bombay Government, but the land tax is levied at survey rates on the whole arable land. The villages on the banks of the river Mah\u012b held on the *mehw\u0101si* tenure pay their revenue in a lump sum. A clan of Musaln\u0101n yeomen, known as the M\u0101liks, have for nearly 400 years held 27 villages on a special tenure.\n\nThe District contains 10 municipalities: namely, Kaira, Kapadvanj, Mehm\u0101d\u0101b\u0101d, Nadi\u0101d, D\u0101kor, Borsad, Anand, Umreth, Od, and Mahudha. The District board was established in 1863, and there are 7 *t\u0101luka* boards. The total expenditure of all these boards in 1903\u20134 was 2\u00bd lakhs, of which half a lakh was spent on roads and buildings. The chief source of income is the land cess.\n\nThe District Superintendent of police has the assistance of 2 inspectors and 10 chief constables. There are 12 police stations. The force in 1904 numbered 555 men, working under 133 head constables. Six mounted police under one *daffad\u0101r* were also maintained. There are 8 subsidiary jails in the District, with accommodation for 187 prisoners. The daily average prison population in 1904 was 36, of whom 2 were females.\n\nThe District stands fourth among the Districts of the Presidency in the literacy of its population, of whom 9\u00b79 per cent. (17\u00b79 males and 0\u00b79 females) were able to read and write in 1901. In 1855\u20136 there were only 7 schools attended by 1,036 pupils; by 1876\u20137 the number of schools had risen to 189 and the number of pupils to 14,720. In 1881 there were 205 schools with 16,107 pupils, who increased to 27,261 by 1891, and numbered 27,911 in 1901. In 1903\u20134 the District contained 365 schools, of which 84 were private, attended by 17,474 pupils, including 2,581 girls. Besides one high school, there were 14 middle and 266 primary schools. Of the 281 public institutions, one is managed by the Educational department, and 246 by\nlocal or municipal boards, while 30 are aided and 4 unaided. The total expenditure on education in 1903-4 was Rs. 1,85,000, of which Rs. 23,000 was derived from fees. Of the total, 79 per cent. was devoted to primary schools.\n\nIn 1904 the District had one hospital and 8 dispensaries, with accommodation for 94 in-patients. The number of patients treated in 1904 was 110,069, including 1,122 in-patients; and 3,675 operations were performed. The expenditure was Rs. 21,000, of which Rs. 15,000 was met from Local and municipal funds. The Irish Presbyterian and Salvation Army Missions have each opened a dispensary at Anand, to which hospitals are shortly to be added.\n\nThe number of persons successfully vaccinated in 1903-4 was 17,000, representing a proportion of 24 per 1,000, which is slightly below the average for the Presidency.\n\n[Sir J. M. Campbell, *Bombay Gazetteer*, vol. iii, Kaira and Panch Mahals (1879).]\n\n**Kaira Town (Kheda).**\u2014Head-quarters of Kaira District, Bombay, situated in 22\u00b0 45' N. and 72\u00b0 41' E., 7 miles south-west of Mehmadabad station on the Bombay, Baroda, and Central India Railway, and 20 miles south-west of Ahmadabad. Population (1901), 10,392. Kaira is a very ancient place, having a legendary connexion with the Mahabharata, and is proved by the evidence of copperplate grants to have existed as early as the fifth century A.D. Early in the eighteenth century it passed to the Babi family, with whom it remained till 1753, when it was taken by the Marathas under Damaji Gaikwar. It was finally handed over to the British by Anand Rao Gaikwar in 1803. Its frontier position rendered Kaira important; and a force of infantry, cavalry, and artillery was stationed there until the transfer, in 1830, of the frontier station to Deesa. The climate is said to have improved of late years. Earthquake shocks were felt in 1860 and 1864. The courthouse is a handsome building with Greek pillars. Near it is a part of the old jail, in 1814 the scene of a riot in which the prisoners rose, and which was only suppressed with a loss of 19 killed and 12 wounded. The municipality was established in 1857, and its income during the decade ending 1901 averaged Rs. 15,000. In 1903-4 the income was Rs. 18,000, chiefly from a house and land tax. Besides the Government revenue offices, the town contains a Sub-Judge's court, a civil hospital, and 6 schools (5 for boys and one for girls), attended by 543 male and 82 female pupils. The boys' schools include an English school with 92 pupils.\n\n**Kairana Tahsil.**\u2014North-western tahsil of Muzaffarnagar District, United Provinces, lying between 29\u00b0 19' and 29\u00b0 42' N. and 77\u00b0 2' and 77\u00b0 30' E., with an area of 464 square miles. It comprises five parshanas\u2014Kairana, Jhinjhana, Shamli, Thana Bhawan, and Bidauli\u2014and\nwas formerly known as Sh\u0101ml\u012b. Population increased from 200,157 in 1891 to 224,679 in 1901. The tahsil contains five towns: namely, Kair\u0101na (population, 19,304), the head-quarters, Th\u0101na Bhawan (8,861), Sh\u0101ml\u012b (7,478), Jal\u0101l\u0101b\u0101d (6,822), and Jhinjh\u0101na (5,094); and 256 villages. In 1903\u20134 the demand for land revenue was Rs. 3,86,000, and for cesses Rs. 50,000. The river Jumna forms the western boundary, and the adjoining tract lies low and is intersected by jhilis and watercourses. The eastern half of the tahsil is, however, part of the upland tract and is irrigated by the Eastern Jumna Canal. In 1903\u20134 the area under cultivation was 291 square miles, of which 131 were irrigated.\n\nKair\u0101na Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the tahsil of the same name in Muzaffarnagar District, United Provinces, situated in 29\u00b0 24' N. and 77\u00b0 12' E. It is the terminus of a metalled road from Muzaffarnagar town. The population is increasing slowly and was 19,304 in 1901. Mukarrab Kh\u0101n, physician to Jah\u0101ng\u012br and Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n, received the town and surrounding country as a grant. He built a darg\u0101h and laid out a beautiful garden with a large tank, and the town also contains several mosques dating from the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Kair\u0101na is built partly on the low-lying Jumna kh\u0101dar and partly on the rising slope to the upland plain, and has a clean, well-paved bazar. The town was constituted a municipality in 1874. During the ten years ending 1901 the income and expenditure averaged Rs. 12,000. In 1903\u20134 the income was Rs. 16,000, chiefly derived from octroi (Rs. 12,000); and the expenditure was Rs. 18,000. Ornamental curtains are made here by pasting small pieces of looking-glass on coloured cloth. There is a considerable amount of traffic in grain with both the Punjab and the railway, and a small calico-printing industry. Besides the tahsil, there are a munisf\u012b, a dispensary, and two schools.\n\nKaisarganj.\u2014South-western tahsil of Bahraich District, United Provinces, comprising the parganas of Fakhrpur and His\u0101mpur, and lying between 27\u00b0 4' and 27\u00b0 46' N. and 81\u00b0 16' and 81\u00b0 46' E., with an area of 679 square miles. Population increased from 332,193 in 1891 to 348,172 in 1901. There are 647 villages, but no town. The demand for land revenue in 1903\u20134 was Rs. 3,29,000, and for cesses Rs. 75,000. The density of population, 513 persons per square mile, is considerably above the District average. The tahsil lies in the wide valley of the Gogra, and is scored by many old channels, the chief of which are the Sarj\u016b or Suhel\u012b and the Tirhi. The whole area is fertile, except where the Gogra has deposited sand, and irrigation is rarely needed. In 1903\u20134 the area under cultivation was 443 square miles, of which only 13 were irrigated.\n\nKaithal Tahsil. Western tahsil and subdivision of Karn\u0101l District,\nPunjab, lying between $29^\\circ 22'$ and $30^\\circ 12'$ N. and $76^\\circ 11'$ and $76^\\circ 47'$ E., with an area of 1,289 square miles. The population in 1901 was 265,189, compared with 257,493 in 1891. It contains the towns of Kaithal (population, 14,408), the head-quarters, and Pundri (5,834); and 413 villages, including Pehowa, a place of religious importance. The land revenue and cesses amounted in 1903-4 to 2.7 lakhs. The tahsil consists chiefly of the petty principality of Kaithal, which escheated in 1843. North of the Ghaggar, the country is undulating and the soil contains a considerable proportion of sand. The tract between the Ghaggar and the southern limits of the Saraswati depression consists of vast prairies, flooded during the rains and interspersed with numerous trees and patches of cultivation. This tract, known as the Naili (N\u0101li), is notoriously unhealthy, but the pasture it affords is invaluable in dry years. The southern half of the tahsil is a level plain, now irrigated by the Western Jumna Canal. On the east is the Nardak. The people have not yet entirely abandoned their pastoral traditions, and large tracts are still used for grazing alone. Farther west, cultivation becomes more general, and in the extreme south-west the soil contains a large proportion of sand.\n\nKaithal Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the subdivision and tahsil of the same name in Karn\u0101l District, Punjab, situated in $29^\\circ 48'$ N. and $76^\\circ 24'$ E., 38 miles west of Karn\u0101l town, and the terminus of the Kaithal branch of the Southern Punjab Railway. Population (1901), 14,408. Kaithal is picturesquely situated on an extensive tank, which partly surrounds it, with numerous bathing-places and flights of steps. It lies in Kurukshetra, and is said to have been founded by the hero Yudhishthira. It bore in Sanskrit the name of Kapisthala, or the 'abode of monkeys,' and possesses an asth\u0101n or temple of Anjani, mother of Hanum\u0101n, the monkey god. During the time of the earlier Muhammadan emperors it was a place of some importance, and Tim\u016br, who says its inhabitants were fire-worshippers, halted here before he attacked Delhi in 1398. The tombs of several saints, the oldest of which is that of the Shaikh Sal\u0101h-ud-d\u012bn of Balkh (A.D. 1246), show that it was a centre of Muhammadan religious life. The town was renovated, and a fort built, under Akbar. In 1767 it fell into the hands of the Sikh chief, Bhai Desu Singh, whose descendants, the Bhais of Kaithal, ranked among the most powerful of the Cis-Sutlej chiefs. Their territories lapsed to the British Government in 1843, when Kaithal became the head-quarters of a District; but in 1849 this was absorbed into Th\u0101nesar District, which was in turn included in that of Karn\u0101l in 1862. The now somewhat dilapidated fort or palace of the Bhais stands out prominently on the bank of the tank. The municipality was created in 1867. The income and expenditure during the ten years ending 1902-3 averaged Rs. 19,900 and Rs. 20,400 respectively.\nIn 1903-4 the income was Rs. 15,800, chiefly derived from octroi; and the expenditure was Rs. 17,400. It maintains a dispensary and an Anglo-veracular middle school. Saltpetre is refined at Kaithal, and it has a considerable manufacture of lacquered wood, besides two cotton factories, one for ginning and the other for ginning and pressing. The number of employ\u00e9s in the factories in 1904 was 103.\n\nKakar.\u2014Taluka of L\u0101rk\u0101na District, Sind, Bombay, lying between 26\u00b0 53' and 27\u00b0 14' N. and 67\u00b0 12' and 67\u00b0 57' E., with an area of 445 square miles. The population in 1901 was 49,252, compared with 47,888 in 1891. The taluka contains 73 villages, of which Khairpur Nathan Sh\u0101h is the head-quarters. The density, 111 persons per square mile, is slightly below the District average. The land revenue and cesses in 1903-4 amounted to 2.1 lakhs. The taluka depends for irrigation on the Western N\u0101ra Canal, but suffers from its position at the lower end of the canal, the waters of which are largely exhausted by the northern talukas. The western portion depends upon rain and a few hill-torrents for cultivation. Jow\u0101r is the principal crop.\n\nKakor\u0101.\u2014Village in the District and talsil of Budaun, United Provinces, situated in 27\u00b0 53' N. and 79\u00b0 3' E., near the bank of the Ganges, 12 miles south-west of Budaun town. Population (1901), 2,941. The place is noted for a religious and trading fair held at the full moon of K\u0101rtik (October-November), which is attended by as many as 100,000 to 200,000 persons, who come from all parts of Rohilkhand, as well as from Delhi, Muttra, and Cawnpore. The principal object is bathing, but a good deal of trade is carried on in cloth, metal goods, leather, and cattle. The actual site of the fair varies within a few miles according to the movements of the river.\n\nKakori.\u2014Town in the District and talsil of Lucknow, United Provinces, situated in 26\u00b0 52' N. and 80\u00b0 48' E., near a station on the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway. Population (1901), 8,933. Kakori is said to have been originally inhabited by Bhars and was subsequently included in Baisw\u0101r\u0101. It was granted to Muhammadans by Husain Sh\u0101h of Jaunpur. Several tombs of noted saints are situated in the town and its environs. Some of the Shaikh families residing here are of antiquity and position, and their members include many of the Lucknow pleaders, who have adorned the town with well-built houses, while others are engaged in Government service. Kakori is administered under Act XX of 1856, with an income of about Rs. 1,300. There are two schools with about 110 pupils.\n\nKakr\u0101l\u0101.\u2014Town in the D\u0101t\u0101ganj talsil of Budaun District, United Provinces, situated in 27\u00b0 53' N. and 79\u00b0 12' E., 12 miles south of Budaun town. Population (1901), 5,954. The name is said to have been derived from kankur or nodular limestone, which is largely found in the neighbourhood. In April, 1858, General Penny defeated near\nKakr\u0101l\u0101 a party of Gh\u0101z\u012bs or fanatical Musalm\u0101ns, who were lying in ambush for him. This victory put an end to the rebel government which had ruled at Budaun for eleven months. The town contains a sarai, and a branch of the American Methodist Mission. It is administered under Act XX of 1856, with an income of about Rs. 1,000. The primary school has 75 pupils.\n\nKal\u0101b\u0101gh.\u2014Small cantonment in Haz\u0101ra District, North-West Frontier Province, situated in $34^\\circ 6'$ N. and $73^\\circ 25'$ E., on the road between Abbott\u0101b\u0101d and Murree. During the summer months it is occupied by one of the British mountain batteries which are stationed at R\u0101walpindi in the winter.\n\nKal\u0101b\u0101gh Estate.\u2014Estate in the District and tahsil of Mi\u0101nw\u0101li, Punjab, with an area of 107 square miles. It is held by Muhammad Kh\u0101n Malik Y\u0101r, the Aw\u0101n Malik of Kal\u0101b\u0101gh. Over 300 years ago the Aw\u0101n Maliks settled at Dhankot, a natural fastness on the Indus above Kal\u0101b\u0101gh. They forced the Bhangi Khel Khattaks of the hills on the north to pay tribute, and at the close of the eighteenth century were recognized as chiefs of the Kal\u0101b\u0101gh territory by Tim\u016br Sh\u0101h Durr\u0101n\u012b. The Sikhs annexed the estate in 1822, but Malik Allah Y\u0101r Kh\u0101n retained it as their feudatory. He assisted Lieutenant (afterwards Sir Herbert) Edwardes to construct the Dalipnagar fort at Bannu, and his son Muzaffar Kh\u0101n was taken prisoner there by the Sikhs in the second Sikh War. During the Mutiny he raised 100 men and was entrusted with the charge of one of the gates of Pesh\u0101war city, receiving the title of Kh\u0101n Bah\u0101dur as a reward. The present Malik, Y\u0101r Muhammad Kh\u0101n, succeeded in 1885. He holds a j\u0101g\u012br worth Rs. 6,000, and his income is about Rs. 22,000 a year, of which Rs. 1,000 is derived from the manufacture of alum.\n\nKal\u0101b\u0101gh Town.\u2014Town in the Isa Khel tahsil of Mi\u0101nw\u0101li District, Punjab, situated in $32^\\circ 58'$ N. and $71^\\circ 33'$ E. Population (1901), 5,824. The town is picturesquely situated at the foot of the Salt Range, on the right bank of the Indus, at the point where the river debouches from the hills, 105 miles below Attock. The houses nestle against the side of a precipitous hill of solid rock-salt, piled one upon another in successive tiers, the roof of each tier forming the street which passes in front of the row immediately above. Long before the British annexation of the Punjab, Kal\u0101b\u0101gh was famous for its salt; and some of the wonders told of it by travellers as long ago as 1808 may still be seen in its houses built of and on rock-salt, its roads cut out of the solid salt rock, and its immense exposures of salt, sometimes closely resembling alabaster. The Kal\u0101b\u0101gh hills are a continuation of the cis-Indus portion of the Salt Range, but are remarkable for the quantity of salt exposed, and the purity, closeness of grain, and hardness of a great proportion of it. Unlike the operations elsewhere in\nthe Salt Range, which are purely mining, the salt is here quarried at the surface. There are twelve quarries, some situated on the right bank of the Indus, and some on the right bank of the L\u00fcn Nullah, which runs into the Indus on its right bank, at the base of a hill known as the Saud\u0101gar hill. Enormous quantities of salt lie exposed here, underlying Tertiary strata, in workable seams of from 4 to 20 feet thick, alternating with seams of impure salt and marl. The deposits rise to a height of about 200 feet above the bed of the Gor gorge, the seams striking south to north and dipping to the west at an angle of about 70\u00b0. The salt is slightly better in quality than that of the Mayo and Warcha Mines, and is in high favour with traders; but it is handicapped in competition with those salts, because the Indus lies between it and the M\u0101ri station of the Kundian-Campbellpore Railway. The quarries lie from half a mile to a mile from the sale d\u00e9p\u00f4t at Kukr\u0101nw\u0101la Vandah on the right bank of the Indus, where the miners deliver the salt at the rate of Rs. 4.2 per 100 maunds. The whole of the operations connected with the salt up to the time that it is deposited in store in the d\u00e9p\u00f4t are in the hands of the miners. At the d\u00e9p\u00f4t the salt is weighed out to purchasers and cleared under the supervision of the inspector in charge. The total quantity issued in 1903-4 amounted to 191,750 maunds, of which 150,062 maunds were removed by rail and 32,161 by river. Alum also occurs in the neighbouring hills, and forms a considerable but decreasing item of local trade, the out-turn in 1904 being about 3,500 maunds, which sold for Rs. 3 per maund (82\u00bd lb.). The town possesses a manufacture of striped cloth (s\u012bs\u012b), and of iron instruments and vessels from metal imported from the K\u0101nigoram hill.\n\nThe municipality was created in 1875. The income and expenditure during the ten years ending 1902-3 averaged Rs. 7,100 and Rs. 6,600. In 1903-4 the income was Rs. 5,600, chiefly derived from octroi; and the expenditure was Rs. 6,700. The town contains a dispensary and a municipal primary school. An Aw\u0101n family, which resides in K\u0101l\u0101bh\u0101gh, has a certain supremacy over the whole of the tribesmen, the representative of the family bearing the title of Malik.\n\nKalabg\u016br.\u2014T\u0101luk in Medak District, Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State, with an area of 432 square miles. The population in 1901, including j\u0101girs, was 78,052, compared with 96,100 in 1891, the decrease being due to emigration and transfer of villages. The t\u0101luk contains one town, Sadaseopet (population, 6,672); and Sangareddipet (4,809) is the head-quarters of the District and t\u0101luk. There are also 144 other villages, of which 60 are j\u0101gir. The land revenue in 1901 was 2.4 lakhs. Kalabg\u016br is well supplied with tanks, and rice and sugar-cane are largely cultivated. The Niz\u0101m\u2019s State Railway passes through its southern portion, and the river M\u0101njra flows through the north.\nK\u0101l\u0101-Chitta.\u2014Mountain range in the Pindi Gheb tahsil of Attock District, Punjab, having the general form of a wedge or triangle, whose base rests upon the left bank of the Indus, near the township of N\u0101ra, while its apex stretches to the Margala pass, about 50 miles to the eastward. The broadest portion has a depth of about 12 miles. The range is formed of two portions differing much in appearance. The south-western part, stretching for 35 miles from the Indus through the Pindi Gheb tahsil, known as the K\u0101l\u0101 Pah\u0101r or \u2018black mountain,\u2019 is generally formed of very dark sandstone, often quite purple in hue, and sometimes blackened by exposure to the weather. Mixed with this are grey sandstone and red clay. The Chitta or \u2018white\u2019 hill runs the whole length of the northern side of the range. It is formed of white Nummulitic limestone, but dark limestone also crops up in its midst; it is by far the more valuable part of the range, the limestone being used for burning, and the forest produce being far better than in the K\u0101l\u0101. Bushes of acacia and wild olive are scattered over its rugged sides, but on the main portion a coarse grass forms the only vegetation.\n\nKaladan.\u2014River of Burma, which rises in the Chin Hills in the Yahow country, and is there known as the Boinu. Its course at first is southwards, then northwards. Bending westwards, it passes through a portion of the Lushai Hills, and then turning south again, enters Northern Arakan at its northern end, and flows down the western side of the District, past Paletwa, the head-quarters, which lies on its western bank. Farther south it enters Akyab District and, continuing in a southerly direction, empties itself after a course of nearly 300 miles into the Bay of Bengal at Akyab, where its estuary is 6 miles in breadth. It is a picturesque river, navigable for steam traffic as high as Paletwa, nearly 100 miles from the sea. Its principal tributaries are the Dalet, Palet, Mi, and Pi.\n\nKal\u0101dgi.\u2014Village in the B\u0101galkot taluka of Bij\u0101pur District, Bombay, situated in 16\u00b0 12' N. and 75\u00b0 30' E., on the right bank of the Ghatprabha river, 15 miles west of B\u0101galkot on the Southern Mahratta Railway. Population (1901), 4,946. Kal\u0101dgi was formerly the chief station of the District and a cantonment. The municipality, established in 1866, was abolished after the removal of the headquarters in 1885.\n\nKal\u0101hand\u012b.\u2014Feudatory State in Bengal, lying between 19\u00b0 3' and 20\u00b0 28' N. and 82\u00b0 32' and 83\u00b0 47' E., and formerly known as Karond. It is bounded on the north by the Patn\u0101 State, on the north-west by Raipur District, and on the east, south-east, and south-west by the Jeypore zamind\u0101ri of Vizagapatam District. The area of the State is 3,745 square miles; and its head-quarters are at Bhaw\u0101ni Patn\u0101, a village of 4,400 inhabitants, 140 miles from Sambalpur and 130 from\nChicacole station on the East Coast Railway. From the north-east to the south-west of the State runs an almost continuous range of hills, a part of the Eastern Gh\u0101ts, with several peaks approaching 4,000 feet in elevation. To the north of this range lies a stretch of comparatively open country interspersed with low hills. The uplands are generally well wooded, except in tracts where the forest has been burnt off for cultivation. The Indr\u0101vati river rises in the south of the State and passes into Bastar after a short course through the hills. The open country is drained by the Tel river and its affluent the Hatti.\n\nThe ruling family are N\u0101gvansi R\u0101jputs, and are said to be connected with the Satrangarh R\u0101j\u0101s of Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur. The State appears to have existed from a remote period without being subject to any definite suzerainty. The payment of tribute and acknowledgement of their supremacy were, however, imposed by the Mar\u0101th\u0101s. In 1878 the chief, Udit Prat\u0101p Deo, obtained an hereditary salute of 9 guns. In 1881, on the death of Udit Prat\u0101p Deo, discontent broke out among the primitive Khond tribe, who form a large proportion of the population. The late R\u0101j\u0101 had encouraged the immigration of members of the Kolt\u0101 caste, who are excellent agriculturists and keenly acquisitive of land; and many of the Khond headmen and tenants had been ousted by them. The smouldering grievances of the Khonds had been suppressed by Udit Prat\u0101p, but they now found expression in acts of plunder. A British officer was dispatched to K\u0101l\u0101hand\u012b to inquire into their complaints, and a settlement was arrived at, which it was thought would prove satisfactory. These hopes, however, were illusory; and in May, 1882, the Khonds rose and slaughtered more than 80 Kolt\u0101s, while 300 more were besieged in the village of Norl\u0101, the Khonds appearing with portions of the scalps and hair of the murdered victims hanging to their bows. On the arrival of a body of police, which had been summoned from Vizagapatam, they dispersed, and the outbreak was soon afterwards suppressed, seven of the ringleaders being arrested, tried, and hanged. A settlement was made of the grievances of the Khonds, and the tranquillity of the State has not again been disturbed. The next chief, Raghu Kishor Deo, was installed in 1894 on attaining his majority, but was murdered in 1897 by a servant. He left an infant son of two years of age, Brij Mohan Deo, who is now being educated at Bhaw\u0101ni Patn\u0101. During his minority the management of the State is in charge of a Political Agent subordinate to the Commissioner of Orissa.\n\nThe population in 1901 was 350,529, having increased by 7 per cent. during the previous decade. The number of inhabited villages is 2,198, and the density of population 94 persons per square mile. About 81 per cent. of the population speak Oriy\u0101 and 15 per cent. Khondi, the language of the Khond tribe. Khonds number 103,000,\nor 29 per cent. of the total; and next to them the most numerous castes are Gahr\u0101s or Ahirs, Doms, a menial caste of sweepers, and Gonds. There is a very slight sprinkling of Telugu castes.\n\nAlong the base of the hills is found a light alluvial soil, fertile and easily tilled, and yielding good crops of almost any grain. The open country is covered by black cotton soil mixed with limestone nodules and with the yellow clay or gravel formed from metamorphic rock. The hilly country on the south and east, amounting to 62 per cent. of the whole State, has not been surveyed. Of the remaining land, 632 square miles, or 45 per cent. of the available area, are occupied for cultivation, and 437 were cultivated in 1904. The staple crops are rice, covering 285 square miles; til, 68; and kodon and kutki, 22. The State contains 1,464 tanks, from which 289 square miles can be irrigated. The numerous streams flowing from the hills also afford natural irrigation to land lying on their banks, and soil in this position gives two crops in the year. Oranges and plantains are grown on irrigated land. The prevailing forest tree in the north of the State is s\u0101l (Shorea robusta), teak being rare and local. With the s\u0101l are associated the other common trees of Peninsular India. Farther to the south between the Tel and Indr\u0101vati, where a range of hills intervenes, the s\u0101l disappears and s\u0101j (Terminalia tomentosa) is the commonest tree. Owing to the distance of the forests from the railway, exports of timber are inconsiderable. No minerals are worked, but graphite occurs in veins and pockets in the metamorphic rocks. The State contains 48 miles of gravelled and 116 of embanked roads. The principal routes are those from Bhaw\u0101ni Patn\u0101 to Raipur, and to Sambalpur through Bol\u0101ngir in Patn\u0101, and from J\u016bn\u0101garh to R\u0101jim through Deobhog. Exports are sent principally to Raipur and the Madras Presidency, while imports are received from Raipur, Sambalpur, and Madras.\n\nThe total revenue in 1904 was Rs. 1,11,000, the principal items being land revenue and cesses, Rs. 59,000; forests, Rs. 14,000; and excise, Rs. 24,000. The unsurveyed territory on the south and east is comprised in six minor zam\u012bnd\u0101ri estates, and a hilly tract called Dongurl\u0101, mainly occupied by Khonds who practise shifting cultivation. The revenue paid by the zam\u012bnd\u0101rs is Rs. 3,500. Two of the zam\u012bnd\u0101ri families are related to the chief. The remaining area has been cadastrally surveyed and a settlement effected. The taxation of land is about 8 annas per cultivated acre. About Rs. 30,000 of the gross land revenue has been assigned in revenue-free grants. The total expenditure in 1904 was Rs. 1,36,000, the principal items being tribute, Rs. 12,000; allowances to the ruling family, Rs. 20,000; general administration, Rs. 14,000; and police, Rs. 18,000. The tribute is liable to revision. In twelve years since 1893 the State has expended 3\u00b723 lakhs on public\nworks under the supervision of the Engineer of the Chhattisgarh States division. The works carried out include, besides the roads mentioned, the construction of a palace, public offices, a hospital, police station, school, and sarai at Bhaw\u0101ni Patn\u0101. The educational institutions comprise 48 schools with 3,876 pupils, including one English and two vernacular middle schools and a girls' school. The total expenditure on education in 1904 was Rs. 7,000. At the Census of 1901, 6,129 persons were returned as able to read and write, the proportion being 1.7 per cent. (3.3 males and 0.1 females). Dispensaries have been established at Bhaw\u0101ni Patn\u0101, J\u016bn\u0101garh, K\u0101sh\u012bpur, and Thu\u0101mal, and a separate dispensary for females at Bhaw\u0101ni Patn\u0101. About 63,000 persons were treated in these institutions in 1904.\n\nK\u0101lahasti Zam\u012bnd\u0101ri.\u2014One of the largest zam\u012bnd\u0101ri estates in Madras, situated partly in North Arcot District, partly in Nellore, and partly in Chingleput. Number of villages, 406 in North Arcot, 201 in Nellore, and 206 in Chingleput; area, 638 square miles in North Arcot, 576 in Nellore, and 250 in Chingleput; total population (1901), 223,327. The capital is K\u0101lahasti Town, where the zam\u012bnd\u0101r resides. The history of the family, which belongs to the Velama caste, is obscure. The original owner of the estate probably received it from a king of the Vijayanagar dynasty in the fifteenth century, on condition of maintaining order. The estate at one time spread as far as the site of Fort St. George, and the Company obtained the land on which Madras now stands from the proprietor in 1639. The settlement is traditionally said to have been named Chenmappatnam in honour of the zam\u012bnd\u0101r's father. The estate came under British control in 1792, and a formal grant to the family was made in 1801. The zam\u012bnd\u0101r afterwards received the hereditary title of R\u0101j\u0101. The gross income amounts to over 5 lakhs. The peshkash (or permanent revenue paid to Government) for the whole of it is 1.7 lakhs, and the demand for land cess amounts to Rs. 35,000. Owing to the estate being heavily encumbered, it was recently taken under the management of the Court of Wards, but it has now been handed back to the proprietor. The estate is in a great measure covered by scrub jungle, especially the portion in North Arcot District. Much firewood is sent to Madras city from these forests; and leopards, bears, and small game are fairly numerous in them. A large number of the jungle tribes of Irulas and Yanadis subsist by gathering honey, roots, and bark for sale in the neighbouring villages. The soil is not very rich, but about 140,000 acres are under cultivation.\n\nK\u0101lahasti Tahs\u012bl.\u2014Zam\u012bnd\u0101ri tahs\u012bl in the K\u0101lahasti zam\u012bnd\u0101ri in the north-east of North Arcot District, Madras, lying between 13\u00b0 14' and 13\u00b0 55' N. and 79\u00b0 27' and 79\u00b0 59' E. Area, 638 square miles; population in 1901, 94,132, compared with 81,860 in 1891.\nThe tahsil contains 324 villages and one town, K\u0101lahasti (population, 11,992), the head-quarters. Demand for peshkash and land cess in 1903\u20134, Rs. 78,000.\n\nK\u0101lahasti Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the tahsil of the same name in North Arcot District, Madras, situated in 13\u00b0 45' N. and 79\u00b0 42' E., with a station on the South Indian Railway, on the right bank of the Swarnamukhi at the extremity of the Nagari hills. Population (1901), 11,992. It is the residence of the R\u0101j\u0101 of K\u0101lahasti, and the head-quarters of the deputy-tahsild\u0101r and sub-magistrate. A large number of the inhabitants are in the employ of the zamind\u0101r, whose residence, an imposing-looking building, faces the eastern street of the old town. The approach to the town from the river is through the last gap in the Nagari hills, which are here considered so holy that the quarrying of stone or gravel is forbidden. K\u0101lahasti is a thriving town, carrying on a brisk trade in grain, bangles, and many other articles. A good deal of cotton stuff is woven in the suburbs, and the hand-printed and hand-painted cotton fabrics enjoy a high reputation. Some of the latter gained a bronze medal at the Delhi Darb\u0101r Exhibition of 1903. The town is famous for its Siva temple, wherein a festival takes place annually during February and March.\n\nKalait.\u2014Village in the Narw\u0101na tahsil, Karmgarh niz\u0101mat, Pati\u0101la State, Punjab, situated in 21\u00b0 49' N. and 76\u00b0 19' E., 13 miles south-west of Kaithal on the Narw\u0101na-Kaithal branch of the Southern Punjab Railway. Population (1901), 3,490. The place is famous for four ancient temples ascribed to R\u0101j\u0101 S\u0101lb\u0101han, and for a tank, called Kap\u0101l Mani's tir\u0101th, which is held sacred by Hindus. The temples, which are adorned with sculptures, are supposed to date from the eleventh century.\n\nKalale.\u2014Village in the Nanjang\u016bd t\u0101luk of Mysore District, Mysore, situated in 12\u00b0 4' N. and 76\u00b0 40' E., 3 miles south-west of Nanjang\u016bd. Population (1901), 2,500. The place is historically interesting as the ancestral domain of the Dalav\u0101yis of Mysore. It is said to have been founded in 1504 by a connexion of the Vijayanagar family. After the Mysore R\u0101j\u0101s acquired Seringapatam in 1610, they formed an alliance with the Kalale family, by which the latter furnished the Dalav\u0101yi, or hereditary minister and general of the State, while Mysore furnished the Kartar ('Curtur' in old English documents) or ruler. Latterly the Dalav\u0101yis rendered the R\u0101j\u0101s subservient to their interests, but were in their turn displaced by Haidar Ali. The municipality formed in 1899 was converted into a Union in 1904. The receipts and expenditure during the two years ending 1901 averaged Rs. 1,990 and Rs. 650. In 1903\u20134 they were Rs. 870 and Rs. 2,800.\n\nKalam.\u2014Crown t\u0101luk in the north of Osm\u0101n\u0101b\u0101d District, Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State. The population in 1901 was 38,030, and the area\n303 square miles; but in 1905 the W\u0101si t\u0101luk was incorporated in it. The total area is now 658 square miles, of which the population in 1901 was 87,701, compared with 120,081 in 1891, the decrease being due to the famine of 1900. The river M\u0101njra separates the t\u0101luk from Bh\u012br District on the north, and the soil is chiefly regar, with some alluvium. It contains 151 villages and yields a land revenue of 3.7 lakhs. The j\u0101g\u012br t\u0101luks of Bh\u016bm and Walwad lie to the west with 31 and 13 villages, and populations (1901) of 11,416 and 6,997 respectively. Their areas are about 143 and 61 square miles.\n\nKalam.\u2014Village in the District and t\u0101luk of Yeotmal, Ber\u0101r, situated in 20\u00b0 27' N. and 78\u00b0 22' E. Population (1901), 3,595. Kalam was formerly an important fortress: and in 1425 the Bahmani king, Ahmad Sh\u0101h Wali, captured it from the 'infidels,' probably Gonds of Ch\u0101nda or Kherla, into whose hands it had fallen. Kalam and M\u0101h\u016br were the most important fortresses in the south-eastern corner of Ber\u0101r at that time. In the Ain-i-Akbar\u012b Kalam is mentioned as the head-quarters of a sark\u0101r or revenue district. It has a remarkable underground temple dedicated to Chint\u0101man.\n\nKal\u0101mn\u016bri.\u2014North-eastern t\u0101luk of Parbhani District, Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State, with an area of 538 square miles. Including j\u0101g\u012brs, the population in 1901 was 58,835, compared with 84,685 in 1891, the decrease being due to the famine of 1900. The t\u0101luk had till recently 186 villages, of which 11 were j\u0101g\u012br; and Kal\u0101mn\u016bri (population, 4,267) is the head-quarters. The land revenue in 1901 was 1.9 lakhs. In 1905 a few villages were added from N\u0101nder District. The Pengang\u0101 flows on the north-eastern border, separating the t\u0101luk from the B\u0101sim District of Ber\u0101r.\n\nKal\u0101naur (1).\u2014Town in the District and tahs\u012bl of Gurd\u0101spur, Punjab, situated in 32\u00b0 0' N. and 75\u00b0 10' E., 15 miles west of Gurd\u0101spur town. Population (1901), 5,251. It was the chief place in the neighbourhood from the fourteenth to the sixteenth century, and was twice attacked by Jasrath Khokhar, once after his unsuccessful assault on Lahore in 1422, and again in 1428, when Malik Sikandar marched to relieve the place and defeated Jasrath on the Be\u0101s. It was here that Akbar received the news of his father's death. He promptly had himself installed on a takht or throne, still to be seen outside the town. Akbar had to retake Kal\u0101naur from Sikandar Sh\u0101h S\u016br in the following year, and resided here for several months. It was plundered by Banda, the Sikh leader, early in the eighteenth century. The municipality was created in 1867. The income during the ten years ending 1902-3 averaged Rs. 5,100, and the expenditure Rs. 5,000. The income and expenditure in 1903-4 were Rs. 5,400, the receipts being chiefly from octroi. The municipality maintains a vernacular middle school and a dispensary.\nKal\u0101naur (2).\u2014Town in the District and tal\u016bk of Rohtak, Punjab, situated in $28^\\circ 50' N.$ and $76^\\circ 24' E.$, 12 miles west of Rohtak town on the road to Bhiw\u0101ni. Population (1901), 7,640. It was founded by Kali\u0101n Singh and Bhaw\u0101n Singh, two Ponw\u0101r R\u0101jputs, sons-in-law of Anang P\u0101l, the king of Delhi, and named after the former. Kal\u0101naur remained in the possession of their descendants, who, though dispossessed for a time by the Balochs of Farrukhnagar, were reinstated by the Delhi court. The town is famous for its leather-work, especially saddlery. It has a vernacular middle school.\n\nKalang.\u2014An offshoot of the Brahmaputra in Assam, which leaves the main stream about 10 miles east of Silgh\u0101t, and, after a tortuous course of about 73 miles through Nowgong District, rejoins it on the confines of K\u0101mr\u016bp. In the upper part of its course the Kalang receives the rivers which flow from the western watershed of the Mik\u012br Hills, while the Kapili, with its affluents the Jamun\u0101 and Doi\u0101ng, the Barp\u0101ni, and the Um\u0101 bring to it the drainage of North C\u0101ch\u0101r and of the Kh\u0101si and Jainti\u0101 Hills. The Digru, another considerable river, joins it near its western mouth. Through the greater portion of its length the banks of the Kalang are lined with villages, the most important of which are Kali\u0101bar, S\u0101maguri, Pur\u0101nigud\u0101m, Nowgong, the District head-quarters, and Rah\u0101; but at its western end the country through which it passes lies too low for cultivation, and the banks of the river are covered with dense jungle grass. A sandbank at its eastern end is a serious obstacle to traffic during the dry season, but in the rains a steamer of low draught plies between Nowgong and Silgh\u0101t, and carries away the tea collected at various centres. Country boats come up from Gauh\u0101ti at all seasons of the year for the transport of mustard, which is grown in large quantities in this portion of the Province. In the dry season the Kalang is fordable at Nowgong and Rah\u0101, but after its junction with the Kapili there is always a considerable depth of water in the channel. Ferries have been established across the river at Kuwarital, Nowgong, Rah\u0101, and J\u0101gi.\n\nKalanga.\u2014Hill in Dehra D\u016bn District, United Provinces, situated in $30^\\circ 20' N.$ and $78^\\circ 5' E.$ A fort was hastily thrown up here by the Gurkhas on the outbreak of the war of 1814. It is perched on a low spur of the Him\u0101layas, $3\\frac{1}{2}$ miles north-east of Dehra, and was attacked in 1815 by General Gillespie, who fell while leading the storming party; for a time it was desperately defended, but the enemy evacuated it after a second assault, and the British demolished it shortly after. A plain white stone monument commemorates those who fell at the taking of the fort. On the slope of the hill is a village called N\u0101l\u0101p\u0101ni, near which is a celebrated spring that forms part of the water-supply of Dehra.\n\nKalasa.\u2014Village in the Mudgere tal\u016bk of Kad\u016br District, Mysore,\nsituated in $13^\\circ 14'$ N. and $75^\\circ 22'$ E., on the Bhadra river, 24 miles north-west of Mudgere town. The village lies in a valley, surrounded by lofty hills, to the south of Mertiparvat, also known as the Kalasa hill. There is a large temple of Kalasesvara, containing thirteenth-century copper grants by Jain queens, and surrounded by fifteenth and sixteenth-century stone inscriptions of the Bhairarasa Wodeyar rulers of K\u0101rkala under Vijayanagar. It was probably a Jain temple originally. Mounds covering ruins of a large town lie on all sides. The original S\u0101ntara kingdom of Pomburchcha extended into the kingdom of Kalasa above the Gh\u0101ts and Karkala below the Gh\u0101ts. Kalasa is called a 'three thousand' kingdom. In the seventeenth century it was absorbed into the Keladi territory. In a sacred bathing-place on the river, called Amb\u0101tirtha, is a large square boulder, placed horizontally on another, and bearing an inscription that it was brought and placed there with one hand by Madhv\u0101ch\u0101rya. This was the founder of the M\u0101dhva sect of Br\u0101hmans, who lived from 1238 to 1317. The areca-nuts produced in the neighbourhood are reckoned the best in Mysore.\n\nK\u0101lastri.\u2014Zam\u012bnd\u0101ri tahsil, estate, and town in North Arcot District, Madras. See K\u0101lahasti.\n\nKal\u0101t State.\u2014Native State in Baluchist\u0101n, lying between $25^\\circ 1'$ and $30^\\circ 8'$ N. and $61^\\circ 37'$ and $69^\\circ 22'$ E., with a total area of 71,593 square miles. It occupies the whole of the centre and south-west of the Province, with the exception of the indentation caused by the little State of Las Bela. It is bounded on the west by Persia; on the east by the Bol\u0101n Pass, the Marri and Bugti hills, and Sind; on the north by the Ch\u0101gai and Quetta-Pishin Districts; and on the south by Las Bela and the Arabian Sea. With the exception of the plains of Kh\u0101r\u0101n, Kachhi, and Dasht in Makr\u0101n, the country is wholly mountainous, the ranges being intersected here and there by long narrow valleys. The principal mountains are the Central Br\u0101hui, K\u012brthar, Pab, Si\u0101h\u0101n, Central Makr\u0101n, and Makr\u0101n Coast Ranges, which descend in elevation from about 10,000 to 1,200 feet. The drainage of the country is almost all carried off to the southward by the N\u0101ri, M\u016bla, Hab, Por\u0101li, Hingol, and Dasht rivers. The only large river draining northwards is the Raksh\u0101n. The coast-line stretches for about 160 miles, from near Kalmat to Gwetter Bay, and the chief port is Pasni. Round Gw\u0101dar the country is in the possession of the Sult\u0101n of Maskat.\n\nThe geological groups in the State include Liassic; Jurassic (lower and upper Cretaceous strata); volcanic rocks of the Deccan trap; K\u012brthar (middle eocene); lower N\u0101ri (upper eocene); and Siw\u0101lik beds (middle and upper miocene), besides extensive sub-recent and recent deposits. The State also includes a portion of the Indus alluvial plain.\nThe botany of the north differs entirely from that of the south. In the former the hill slopes occasionally bear juniper, olive, and pistachio; poplars, willows, and fruit trees grow in the valleys; herbaceous and bulbous plants are frequent on the hill-sides; and in the valleys southernwood (*Artemisia*) and many *Astragali* occur. In the latter the vegetation consists of a thorny unpleasant scrub, such plants as *Capparis aphylla*, *Prosopis spicigera*, *Calotropis procera*, *Acanthodium spicatum*, and *Acacia* being common. The dwarf-palm (*Nannorhops Ritchieana*) affords a means of livelihood to many of the inhabitants.\n\nSind ibex and mountain sheep occur, but are decreasing in numbers. 'Ravine deer' (gazelle) are common. Bears and leopards are seen occasionally. The wild ass is found in the western desert. *Sisi* and *chikor* are abundant in the higher hills.\n\nThe climatic conditions vary greatly. Along the coast conditions are intermediate between those of India and the Persian Gulf. Farther inland great heat is experienced during summer, and the cold season is short. Kachhi is one of the hottest parts of India. Round Kal\u0101t, on the other hand, the seasons are as well marked as in Europe; the temperature in summer is moderate, while in winter severe cold is experienced and snow falls. All the northern parts depend on the winter snow and rain for cultivation; in the south most of the rain falls in the summer; everywhere it is irregular, scanty, and local.\n\nThe history of the State has been given in the historical portion of the article on Baluchist\u0101n. After being held successively by Sind, by the Arabs, Ghaznivids, Ghorids, and Mongols,\n\n**History.** and again returning to Sind in the days of the S\u016bmras and Sammas, it fell under the Mughal emperors of Delhi. The Ahmadzai power rose in the fifteenth century and reached its zenith in the eighteenth, but it was always subject to the suzerainty of Delhi or Kandah\u0101r. After the first Afgh\u0101n War Kal\u0101t came under the control of the British\u2014a control which was defined and extended by the treaties of 1854 and 1876.\n\nThe most interesting archaeological remains in the country are the Kausi and Khusravi *k\u0101rez* in Makr\u0101n, and the ubiquitous stone dams known as *gabrbands* or 'embankments of the fire-worshippers.' Mounds containing pottery are frequent, and Buddhist remains have been found in Kachhi.\n\nKal\u0101t Town is the capital of the State. Other towns of importance are Bh\u0101g, Gand\u0101va, M\u0101stung, Pasni, and Gw\u0101dar. Permanent villages number 1,348, or one to 53 square miles; the majority of the population live in mat huts or in blanket tents. The State is divided into five main divisions: Kachhi, Saraw\u0101n, Jhalawan, Makr\u0101n, and Kh\u0101r\u0101n, the latter being quasi-independent. The population, which numbers (1903) 470,336, consists chiefly of\nBr\u0101huis and Baloch, but also includes Jats, who are cultivators in Kachhi; Darz\u0101das and Nakibs, the cultivating class of Makr\u0101n; Loris, who are artisans; Meds and Koras, who are fishermen and seamen; and servile dependants. The traders consist of Hindus and a few Khojas on the coast. The majority of the people are Sunni Muhammadans, but, in the west, many belong to the sect called Zikri. Except in Makr\u0101n and Kh\u0101r\u0101n, the people are organized into tribes, each of which acknowledges the leadership of a chief. Besides these tribesmen, who form the Br\u0101hui confederacy with the Kh\u0101n of Kal\u0101t at its head, a distinct body is found in the Kh\u0101n\u2019s own ul\u016bs or following, consisting of the cultivators in those portions of the country from which the Kh\u0101n collects revenue direct. They are chiefly Dehw\u0101ris and Jats. Agriculture, flock-owning combined with harvesting, and fishing constitute the means of livelihood of most of the population. Br\u0101hui, Baluchi, Dehw\u0101ri, and Sindi are the languages chiefly spoken.\n\nThe soil is sandy in most places: here and there alluvial deposits occur and a bright red clay, which gives place in Makr\u0101n to the white clay known as milk. Permanent irrigation is possible only in a few favoured tracts; elsewhere, the country depends almost entirely on flood cultivation from embankments. In irrigated tracts the supply of water is obtained from k\u0101rez, springs, and rivers. The staple food-grains consist of wheat and jow\u0101r. In Makr\u0101n the date is largely consumed. Rice, barley, melons, millets, tobacco, lucerne, potatoes, and beans are also cultivated. The commonest tree in the orchards is the pomegranate; and apricots, almonds, mulberries, vines, and apples are also grown. Experiments in sericulture are being made at Mastung.\n\nAn excellent breed of cattle comes from N\u0101ri in Kachhi. The Saraw\u0101n country and Kachhi produce the best horses in Baluchist\u0101n. The State possessed 783 branded mares in 1924. Large donkeys are bred near Kal\u0101t town, and those in Makr\u0101n are noted for their speed. Sheep and goats are very numerous. The sheep\u2019s wool, of which large quantities are exported, is coarse and comes into the market in a deplorable condition of dirt. The goats are generally black. Camels are bred in large numbers in Kachhi, the Pab hills, and Kh\u0101r\u0101n, and animals for transport are available almost everywhere. All households keep fowls. The better classes breed good greyhounds for coursing. The fishing industry on the Makr\u0101n coast is important and capable of development. Air-bladders, shark-fins, and salted fish are exported in large quantities.\n\nVery little money circulates in the country, both rents and wages being usually paid in kind, and most of the tribesmen\u2019s dealings are carried on by barter. Owing to the inhospitable nature of the country,\nthe people are very poor. The standard of living has risen slightly of recent years, and the people are now better clothed than formerly. A Br\u0101hui will never beg in his own country. With the Makr\u0101nis mendicancy, which is known as pindag, is extremely common.\n\nNo arrangements for forest 'reservation' exist in the State; here and there, however, tribal groups preserve special grounds for grass and pasturage. Among minor forest products may be mentioned cumin seed, asafoetida, medicinal drugs, the fruit of the pistachio, bdellium, and gum-arabic. Few minerals have been discovered, and coal alone, which occurs in the Sor range in the Saraw\u0101n country, is systematically worked. Traces of coal have been found elsewhere in the Saraw\u0101n country. Ferrous sulphate is obtainable in the Jhalaw\u0101n country, and lead was at one time worked at Sekr\u0101n in the same area. Good earth-salt, known as h\u0101m\u016bn or kaf, is obtainable from the swamps, and is also manufactured by lixiviation.\n\nCoarse cotton cloth is woven in Kachhi and articles of floss silk are made in Makr\u0101n. All Br\u0101hui women are expert with the needle, and the local embroidery is both fine and artistic. Rugs, nose-bags, &c., woven by nomads in the dar\u012b stitch, are in general use. The art of making pile-carpets is known here and there. Durable overcoats (sh\u0101i) are made by the women from dark sheep's wool. Leather is embroidered in Kachhi, Kal\u0101t, and Mastung. Matting, bags, ropes, and other articles are manufactured from the dwarf-palm.\n\nCommerce is hampered by the levy of transit dues and octroi, both by the State and by tribal chiefs, and by the expense of camel-transport. The chief centres of trade are Kal\u0101t, Mastung, Gand\u0101va, Bh\u0101g, Turbat, Gw\u0101dar, Pasni, and N\u0101l. The exports consist of wool, ghi, raw cotton, dates, salted fish, matting, medicinal drugs, and cattle, in return for which grain, piece-goods, metals, and silk are imported. From the north the traffic goes to Quetta; from the centre to Kachhi and Sind; and from the south and west by sea and land to Kar\u0101chi.\n\nThe North-Western Railway traverses the east and north-east of the State. The only cart-road is that from Quetta to Kal\u0101t town. All other communications consist of tracks for pack-animals, the most important of which are those connecting Kal\u0101t with Panjg\u016br, Kal\u0101t with Bela via Wad, and Kachhi with Makr\u0101n via the M\u016bla Pass. A track is now in course of construction from Pasni on the coast to Panjg\u016br. A postal service to Kal\u0101t is maintained by the British Government, and letters are carried thence once a week to Khuzd\u0101r. The British India Company's mail steamers touch at Pasni and Gw\u0101dar on alternate weeks, and mails are carried from Pasni to Turbat, the head-quarters of Makr\u0101n. The Indo-European Telegraph wire traverses the coast, with\noffices at Pasni and Gw\u0101dar; a telegraph line runs from Quetta to Kal\u0101t, and a line has been sanctioned from Kar\u0101chi to Panjg\u016br.\n\nThe State experiences constant scarcity and occasional famine. A drought lasting for ten years between 1830 and 1840 is mentioned by Masson. The population is, however, sparse and exceedingly hardy, and they have ready access to Sind, where good wages are obtainable. In the Census of 1901 as many as 47,345 Br\u0101huis were enumerated there. Advances amounting to about Rs. 29,000 were made by the State in 1900, when the scarcity which had begun in 1897 reached its culminating point. Such advances are recovered from the cultivator's grain heap at the ensuing harvests.\n\nThe control exercised by the British Government over the Br\u0101hui confederacy, and the administrative arrangements in areas subject to the direct authority of the Kh\u0101n of Kal\u0101t, are described in the article on Baluchist\u0101n. Except Kh\u0101r\u0101n and Makr\u0101n, each main division of the State comprises both tribal areas and areas subject solely to the Kh\u0101n. Collateral authority is, therefore, exercised by the Kh\u0101n in his ni\u0101bats and by tribal chiefs in their country. The intervention of the Political Agent is confined, as far as possible, to deciding inter-tribal cases or cases between the tribesmen and the Kh\u0101n's subjects in which a right of arbitration rests with the British Government. In Makr\u0101n the Kh\u0101n's n\u0101zim exercises authority everywhere: in Kh\u0101r\u0101n the chief is now subject to no interference from the Kh\u0101n, but looks to the Political Agent in Kal\u0101t. The Quetta, Nushki, and Nasir\u0101b\u0101d tahsils have been leased in perpetuity by the State to the British Government, and the right to levy transit dues in the Bol\u0101n Pass has been commuted for an annual subsidy of Rs. 30,000. The head-quarters of the Political Agent were fixed at Mastung in 1904.\n\nThe revenue of the State is derived from three principal sources: subsidies and rents paid by the British Government, interest on investments, and land revenue. The subsidies include Rs. 1,00,000 paid under the treaty of 1876 and Rs. 30,000 for the Bol\u0101n Pass, while the quit-rents for the leased areas mentioned above amount to Rs. 1,51,500. Since 1893 a surplus of 41.5 lakhs has been invested in Government securities, yielding in interest 1.5 lakhs per annum. From this source are defrayed the cost of maintenance of the former Kh\u0101n, M\u012br Khud\u0101d\u0101d, the subsidies paid to the Jhalaw\u0101n chiefs, the pay of Br\u0101hui th\u0101nas, and the expenses of the administration of Makr\u0101n. The total income of the State may be estimated at between 7\u00bd and 8\u00be lakhs of rupees, the variations being due to fluctuations in the land revenue. The expenditure amounts to about 3\u00bd or 4 lakhs. A sum of Rs. 53,000 is expended annually in the State by the British Government, in the\nshape of telegraph subsidies, payments to chiefs for controlling their tribesmen, and the maintenance of levies. To this will now be added the charges, amounting to about 1\u00b72 lakhs per annum, for the Makr\u0101n Levy Corps.\n\nLand revenue is collected in kind, the rates varying from one-third to one-eighth of the produce. Cesses are also taken, the amount of which differs in almost every village, but which raise the share taken by the State to nearly one-half. Here and there are to be found cash assessments (zar-i-kalang or zar-i-sh\u0101h). The cultivators also perform certain services for the Kh\u0101n, such as the escort of his horses and the repairs to the walls of his forts. Transit dues (mu\u1e25\u0101ri) are levied on caravans passing through the ni\u0101bats, and octroi (sung) on their entering and leaving trading centres. Contracts are given for the sale of liquor, meat, &c. The total land revenue varies with the agricultural conditions of the year. In 1903\u20134, on the introduction of a new system of administration, it rose to 4\u00b75 lakhs. Large areas are held by tribesmen and tribal chiefs, in which the Kh\u0101n is entitled to no revenue. In others, half the revenue has been alienated by the Kh\u0101n (adh-amb\u0101ri). Many of these j\u0101girs were originally held on the condition of feudal service. In Makr\u0101n the Gichkis, Nausherw\u0101nis, Bizanjaus, and M\u012brw\u0101ris are the principal holders, while in Kachhi the j\u0101girs are held by Br\u0101huis and Baloch. In such areas the tribal chiefs claim complete independence in all revenue, civil, and criminal matters. In adh-amb\u0101ri areas the Kh\u0101n retains jurisdiction.\n\nThe army is an irregular force, without organization or discipline, consisting of 300 infantry, 300 cavalry, and 90 artillery with 29 old-fashioned guns, of which none are serviceable. The infantry is divided into two regiments, and the cavalry into three. The total cost amounts to about Rs. 82,000 per annum. Most of the troops are at Kal\u0101t; detachments are stationed at Mastung and Khuzd\u0101r, and in Kachhi. Sepoys are paid Rs. 6 a month; non-commissioned officers, Rs. 7 to Rs. 12; while ris\u0101ld\u0101rs and commandants receive from Rs. 20 to Rs. 50. The cavalry soldiers are mounted on horses found by the State. A force of 160 men is also maintained in Makr\u0101n, at an annual cost of about Rs. 32,000. Between 1894 and 1898 a body of 205 infantry and 65 camelmen under a British officer, known as the Kal\u0101t State Troops, was maintained, but has been disbanded.\n\nAt the most important places in the Kh\u0101n\u2019s ni\u0101bats levies, known as amla, are stationed. These men are used for all kinds of duties, both revenue and criminal. They number 222, of whom 118 are mounted on their own horses and 64 are supplied with horses, when required, by the Kh\u0101n. The remainder are unmounted. They are paid in kind, and get Rs. 18 per annum in cash. The total cash payments made to them amount to about Rs. 4,000. For dealing with cases in which\nBr\u0101huis are concerned, th\u0101nas, manned by Br\u0101hui tribesmen, are located in different parts of the country. They number eleven, with 100 men. In tribal areas and j\u0101girs the peace is maintained by the chiefs, subsidies amounting to about Rs. 50,000 being paid by the Kh\u0101n for this purpose in addition to the amounts paid by the British Government. A force of ten police is attached to the Political Adviser to the Kh\u0101n for escort duty. One jail is maintained, with accommodation for 100 prisoners, and there are lock-ups at the Br\u0101hui th\u0101nas. Offenders are often kept in the stocks, and are fed by their relations.\n\nEducation has hitherto been entirely neglected, but a large school is about to be opened at Mastung. A few boys are taught in mosque schools, and Hindu children receive education from their parents. Two dispensaries are maintained, one by the British Government and the other by the State. They relieved 8,919 patients in 1903 and cost Rs. 5,300. Inoculation is practised everywhere, principally by the Saiyids and Shaikhs, but the people have no objection to vaccination. The whole country has been surveyed on the \u00bd-inch scale up to 66\u00b0 E.; the results of a reconnaissance survey westward have been published on the \u00be-inch scale.\n\n[Baluchist\u0101n Blue Books, Nos. 1, 2, and 3 (1887); H.

It is known to the natives as Kal\u0101t-i-Baloch and Kal\u0101t-i-Sewa; the former to distinguish it from Kal\u0101t-i-Ghilzai in Afghanistan, and the latter after its legendary founder. The population (1901) does not exceed 2,000 persons. The inhabitants are chiefly the Kh\u0101n's troops, numbering 491, and his retainers, with a few Hindu traders. The town occupies a spur of the Sh\u0101h-i-Mard\u0101n hill on the west of the Kal\u0101t valley. A wall surrounds it, with bastions at intervals. Its three approaches on the north, south, and east are known respectively as the Mastungi, Gilkand, and Dild\u0101r gates. Three suburbs lie close by. Commanding the town is the miri or citadel, an imposing structure in which the Kh\u0101n resides. Kal\u0101t fell into the hands of the M\u012brw\u0101ris about the fifteenth century, since which time the place has remained the capital of the Ahmadzai Kh\u0101ns. In 1758 it withstood three assaults by Ahmad Sh\u0101h Durrani, and in 1839 was taken by the British under General Willshire. A year later it surrendered to the Saraw\u0101n insurgents. Below the citadel lies a Hindu temple of K\u0101li, probably of pre-Muhammadan date. The marble image of the goddess, holding the emblem of plenty, stands in front of two lights which are perpetually burning. The\ntrade of the town is chiefly retail business. Taxes on trade are collected by a system of contracts. Police functions are carried out by an official known as mir shab, assisted by watchmen (kotw\u0101ls).\n\nKalataik.\u2014Ancient site in Thaton District, Lower Burma. See Taikkala.\n\nKalat-i-Ghilzai.\u2014Fort in the Kandah\u0101r province of Afgh\u0101nist\u0101n, situated in 30\u00b0 7' N. and 66\u00b0 55' E., on the road from Kandah\u0101r to Ghazni; 5,453 feet above the sea. It stands on the right bank of the Tarnak river, 87 miles from Kandah\u0101r and 229 from K\u0101bul. The fort was occupied in 1842 by a sepoy garrison under Captain Craigie, which gallantly repulsed a determined Afgh\u0101n attack in greatly superior numbers. In memory of this feat of arms, the 12th Pioneers still bear the name of 'The Kelat-i-Ghilzai Regiment,' and carry a special colour with the motto 'Invicta.' The fort was again held by a detachment of British troops in 1879\u201380. In the winter months the cold is very great; during spring and summer the climate is pleasant. The fort gives its name to one of the districts of the Kandah\u0101r province.\n\nKalburga.\u2014Town in Gulbarga District, Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State. See Gulbarga.\n\nKale Subdivision.\u2014South-western subdivision of the Upper Chindwin District, Upper Burma, containing the Masein, Kalewa, and Kale townships.\n\nKale.\u2014South-western township of the Upper Chindwin District, Upper Burma, lying along the eastern slopes of the Chin Hills, between 22\u00b0 40' and 23\u00b0 41' N. and 93\u00b0 58' and 94\u00b0 16' E., with an area of 816 square miles. The population in 1901 was 10,691, distributed in 94 villages, Kalemyo (population, 881), on the Myittha stream, about 20 miles from its mouth, being the head-quarters. The township, which possesses a pestilential climate, consists of the valleys of the Myittha and its tributary the Neyinzaya chaung, which flows past the village of Yazagyo in a southerly direction to meet it. The area cultivated in 1903\u20134 was 34 square miles, and the land revenue and thathameda amounted to Rs. 34,000. The township was formed after the Census of 1901.\n\nKale.\u2014Village in the Kar\u0101d t\u0101luka of S\u0101t\u0101ra District, Bombay, situated in 17\u00b0 14' N. and 74\u00b0 13' E., 31 miles south-by-east of S\u0101t\u0101ra town. Population (1901), 5,077. Near it lie the Agashiv caves, the oldest Buddhist caves in the District.\n\nKalewa Township.\u2014Southern township of the Upper Chindwin District, Upper Burma, lying on either side of the Chindwin river, between 23\u00b0 1' and 23\u00b0 17' N. and 94\u00b0 14' and 94\u00b0 30' E., with an area of 184 square miles, nearly the whole being a mass of low hills. The population in 1901 was 3,535, distributed in 36 villages. The head-quarters are at Kalewa (population, 1,036), situated at the junction\nof the Myittha and Chindwin rivers, about 40 miles below Kindat. The area cultivated in 1903-4 was 11 square miles, and the land revenue and thathameda amounted to Rs. 10,000. The township was formed after the Census of 1901.\n\nKalghatgi.\u2014Western taluka of Dh\u0101rw\u0101r District, Bombay, lying between 15\u00b0 2' and 15\u00b0 22' N. and 74\u00b0 56' and 75\u00b0 8' E., with an area of 275 square miles. There are 99 villages, but no town. The head-quarters are at Kalghatgi. The population in 1901 was 53,657, compared with 55,258 in 1891. The density, 195 persons per square mile, is much below the District average. The demand for land revenue in 1903-4 was 1.3 lakhs, and for cesses Rs. 9,000. Most of the country is broken by wooded hills. The east and south are open and rolling, with bushy uplands. The north and west are wilder. The supply of water is on the whole plentiful. The rainfall in the west is heavier than in the rest of the taluka\u2014the average at Kalghatgi village being 36 inches a year.\n\nK\u0101li.\u2014River of Nep\u0101l and the United Provinces, better known as the S\u0101rd\u0101.\n\nKali\u0101kheri.\u2014Head-quarters of the Niz\u0101mat-i-Jan\u016bb or southern district of Bhop\u0101l State, Central India, situated in 23\u00b0 2' N. and 77\u00b0 40' E., 6 miles by metalled road from Hirania station on the Midland section of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway. Population (1901), 1,333. It contains a school and British and State post offices.\n\nKali\u0101na (or Chal-Kaly\u0101na).\u2014Town in the D\u0101dri tahsil of Jind State, Punjab, situated in 28\u00b0 33' N. and 76\u00b0 16' E., 5 miles east of D\u0101dri town. Population (1901), 2,714. It was the capital of Kaly\u0101n of the Chal tribe, a R\u0101j\u0101 who in 1325 rebelled against Alaf Kh\u0101n, son of Ghiy\u0101s-ud-d\u012bn Tughlak, king of Delhi, and was defeated and slain by Saiyid Hid\u0101yatullah Kh\u0101n, who also fell and whose tomb still exists.\n\nKaliandroog.\u2014T\u0101luk and town in Anantapur District, Madras. See KALYANDRUG.\n\nK\u0101li Baori.\u2014Bh\u016bmi\u0101l in the Bhop\u0101war Agency, Central India.\n\nK\u0101liganj.\u2014Village in the S\u0101tkhira subdivision of Khuln\u0101 District, Bengal, situated in 22\u00b0 27' N. and 89\u00b0 2' E., on the K\u0101nsi\u0101li river. Population (1901), 47. K\u0101liganj lies on the boat-route between Calcutta and the eastern Districts, and has a large bazar and considerable local trade. It is also noted for its manufacture of earthenware, horn, and cutlery.\n\nKalimpong (or D\u0101lingkot).\u2014A hilly tract in Darjeeling District, Bengal, lying between 26\u00b0 51' and 27\u00b0 12' N. and 88\u00b0 28' and 88\u00b0 53' E., with an area of 412 square miles. It is situated east of the Tista, west of the Ni-chu and Di-chu (Jaldh\u0101ka), and south of the State of Sikkim.\nand was acquired from Bhutan after the campaign of 1864-5. Of the total area, 213 square miles are occupied by 'reserved' forests and 10 square miles by four tea gardens, while 179 square miles are reserved for native cultivation: five-sixths of the inhabitants are settled on the kh\u0101s mah\u0101ls or state lands. The country is cut up by ridges of varying height and steepness, separated by narrow valleys, the principal of which run back far into the mountains. These ridges debouch into the plains at elevations ranging from 300 feet to 1,000 feet above sea-level, rising in the interior to 10,500 feet at Rishi La. Over a large portion of the tract the 'reserved' forests cover the tops of the ridges and the bottoms of the valleys, while the cultivated area occupies the intervening space. The land above 5,000 feet is mostly, and that above 6,000 feet almost entirely, under 'reserved' forest, which also covers most of the area below 2,000 feet. The chief crop grown is maize, which occupies 38,000 acres, or more than three-quarters of the net cropped area. A new settlement of the land revenue was completed in 1903; the demand is Rs. 10,000 per annum, and Rs. 1,300 is realized from cesses. A poll tax was originally levied, which was gradually replaced by block rates, and these have in their turn given way to a differential classification and assessment of the lands within each block.\n\nThe land has been classified for revenue purposes as cardamom, held rent free for the first three years, during which there is practically no out-turn, after which it is assessed at Rs. 10 per acre; terraced rice lands, paying from 8 annas to Rs. 1-4 per acre; unterraced cultivation, including fallows of less than three years' standing, paying 6 annas to 15 annas per acre; and fallows of three years' standing and over, paying from 2 to 3 annas per acre. Some lands in each of the last three classes are assessed at a slightly lower rate for the first few years of the settlement. The estate has been divided into 48 blocks, excluding Kalimpong bazar, each under a headman or mandal, who is responsible for the collection of rents, the repair of roads, and certain other duties, in return for which he receives a percentage on the collections and certain other privileges. The total rental of the kh\u0101s mah\u0101ls for 1903-4 was Rs. 31,000, and they are exempt from the payment of cesses. The chief village in the estate is Kalimpong; and there are large bazars at Pedong on the Tibetan trade route, and at Somb\u0101ri at the end of the Chel valley, where the produce of the hill cultivators is sold to the cultivators of the Du\u0101rs. The forests and the colliery at D\u0101ling have been referred to in the article on Darjeeling District. A new tract has been opened for cinchona cultivation at Munsang. Oranges are grown and exported to the Du\u0101rs and the tarai.\n\n[C. A. Bell, Settlement Report (Calcutta, 1905).]\n\nKalimpong Village.\u2014Village in the head-quarters subdivision of\nDarjeeling District, Bengal, situated in $27^\\circ 4' N.$ and $88^\\circ 28' E.$, 3,933 feet above sea-level. Population (1901), 1,069. The village, which has given its name to the tract of hilly country formerly known as D\u0101lingkot, is the established market for Tibetan wool and other exports, and contains a large bazar. The wool, which is brought in via the Jelep La from Tibet, is dispatched by carts along the Tista valley road to Siliguri on the Eastern Bengal State Railway. Since 1891 a fair has been held annually in November at K\u0101limpong, at which agricultural produce and stock are exhibited and prizes are given both in cash and in the form of English poultry and selected seed; this is the most successful agricultural show in Bengal, and is supported by subscriptions supplemented by a Government grant. More than 100 Tibetan mules are annually purchased here by Government for transport purposes at an average price of Rs. 150. A branch of the Church of Scotland Mission, established at K\u0101limpong, possesses a church, an Anglo-Hindi middle school with 4 masters and 55 pupils, and a hospital with 28 beds in connexion with the Government dispensary. The St. Andrew\u2019s Colonial Homes were instituted in 1900, under the auspices of the Church of Scotland, for the education of poor European and Eurasian children. The object of these homes is to give the children, in a healthy District and favourable environment, such a course of training as will fit them for emigration to the Colonies, or make them more robust for work in India. The scheme is managed by an independent committee, and the system adopted is that of cottage homes, each cottage holding 25 to 30 children. Originally 100 acres of land were granted by Government and an agricultural expert was appointed to superintend the outdoor work. The board of management have since obtained permission to acquire a tract of about 330 acres more and to hold it in the position of a ryot; of this, about 200 acres have already been acquired. The first cottage was opened in 1901, and three other cottages and a central school have since been added.\n\nK\u0101li Nadi, East (properly K\u0101l\u012bnd\u012b, corrupted into K\u0101li Nadi or \u2018black river\u2019 by Persian writers).\u2014River of the United Provinces, flowing through the Districts of Muzaffarnagar, Meerut, Bulandshahr, Aligarh, Etah, and Farrukh\u0101b\u0101d. It rises under the name of N\u0101gan in Muzaffarnagar ($29^\\circ 19' N., 77^\\circ 48' E.$), but in this District as well as in Meerut its bed is ill-defined and often dry. In Bulandshahr it becomes a perennial stream, running through a valley marked by high banks, and takes the name of K\u0101li Nadi. Its course then changes from south to south-east till it joins the Ganges not far above Kanauj, 310 miles from its source. The valley of the river in Bulandshahr, and in Etah, Mainpuri, and Farrukh\u0101b\u0101d, has suffered from the inability of the channel to carry off excessive rainfall, the effects in Bulandshahr\nbeing augmented by the use of the river as a canal escape. Of late years, however, the Irrigation department has carried out a number of works to improve the flow, and deterioration has stopped. In 1885 a flood swept away the Nadrai aqueduct in Etah, which carries the Lower Ganges Canal over the river, and a series of wet seasons caused the land in the valley to deteriorate so much that large reductions of assessment were made. This tract has now recovered to a great extent.\n\n**K\u0101l\u012b Nadi, West.**\u2014A tributary of the Hindan, about 70 miles long, rising in the Saharanpur District of the United Provinces (30\u00b0 N., 77\u00b0 45' E.), 16 miles from the Siwaliks, and flowing south-west and south through Saharanpur and Muzaffarnagar, between the Hindan and the Ganges Canal. Its junction with the Hindan is at the point where the latter river enters Meerut.\n\n**Kalinga.**\u2014One of the ancient kingdoms on the east coast of India. Its limits have been variously fixed, but it appears to have included the country lying between the Eastern Gh\u0101ts and the sea from the God\u0101vari river as far north as Orissa. Its people and its reigning house are alluded to in the oldest extant chronicles of India and Ceylon, and were also known to the classical writers of Greece and Rome and to the inhabitants of the Far East. They appear to have been adventurous traders by sea to different countries. The earliest Buddhist legends speak of the Kalinga monarchs as being even then the rulers of a civilized country, but little definite is known of them. A number of kings belonging to the Eastern Gangas of Kalinga are named in copperplate grants, which are dated in an era whose starting-point has yet to be settled. The earliest of these kings is believed to belong to the seventh century. Later records of the same family state that the Gangas of Kalinga were the cousins of the Western Gangas of Mysore. At the beginning of the eleventh century the Cholas overran Kalinga, which was then in the possession of the Eastern Ch\u0101lukyas, and set up a pillar of victory on the Mahendragiri hill. The Gangas appear to have held Kalinga until a comparatively late period, though defeated by the Gajapatis in the fifteenth century. Inscriptions recently deciphered seem to show that their capital, for which very various sites have been at different times assigned, was at Mukhalingam in Ganjam District.\n\n**Kalingapatam.**\u2014Historic village in Ganjam District, Madras. See Calingapatam.\n\n**Kal\u0131njar.**\u2014Town and hill-fort in the Girw\u0101n tahsil of B\u0101nd\u0101 District, United Provinces, situated in 25\u00b0 1' N. and 80\u00b0 29' E., 35 miles south of B\u0101nd\u0101 town. Population (1901), 3,015. The fort occupies a hill which rises abruptly, and is separated from the nearest eminence by a valley about seven miles across. Elevation, 1,203 feet above the sea. The crown of the hill is a plateau. Vast polyhedral masses of\nsyenite form the base and afford a comparatively accessible slope, but the horizontal strata of sandstone which cap the whole present so hold an escarpment as to be practically impossible of ascent.\n\nK\u0101linjar is one of the very ancient forts of Bundelkhand, and separate names for it are recorded in each of the three prehistoric periods of Hindu chronology. It is said to have been called Ratnak\u016b\u1e6da in the Satya-yuga, Mah\u0101giri ('the great hill') in the Treta, and Ping\u0101lu (the 'brown-yellow' hill) in the Dv\u0101para-yuga. Other accounts transpose or vary these names. But its present appellation, K\u0101linjar, is itself of great antiquity. It occurs, as will be mentioned hereafter, in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata; it is conjectured to appear in Ptolemy under the name of Tamasis; and it is mentioned in the Siva Pur\u0101na as one of the nine utkals, from which will burst forth the waters that are finally to destroy the world. The modern name is sometimes rendered K\u0101lanjar, from the local worship of Siva under his title of K\u0101lanjara, or 'He who causes time to grow old.' It was a very ancient seat of Saivite rites, and according to local traditions was strongly fortified by Chandra Brim or Varmma, the legendary founder of the Chandel dynasty.\n\nAs in many other cases, K\u0101linjar was a high place sanctified by superstition, and fortified partly by nature and partly by art. The Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata mentions it as already a famous city, and states that whoever bathes in the Lake of the Gods, the local place for pilgrimage, is as meritorious as he who bestows in charity one thousand cows. The hill must have been covered with Hindu temples before the erection of the fort, for the dates of the inscriptions on the sacred sites are earlier than those on the gates of the fortress; and the ramparts consist largely of ornamental pillars, cornices, and other fragments of carved work, which evidently belonged to earlier edifices. Firishta speaks of it as having been founded by Ked\u0101r N\u0101th, a reputed contemporary of the Prophet, in the seventh century A.D. The Musalm\u0101n historians make mention of the king of K\u0101linjar as an ally of Jaip\u0101l, R\u0101j\u0101 of Lahore, in his unsuccessful invasion of Ghazni, A.D. 978. A R\u0101j\u0101 of K\u0101linjar was also present at the battle of Pesh\u0101war, fought by Anand P\u0101l in 1008, when endeavouring to check the victorious advance of Mahm\u016bd of Ghazni in his fourth expedition. In 1021 Ganda or Nanda, the Chandel R\u0101j\u0101 of K\u0101linjar, defeated the king of Kanauj; and in 1023 Mahm\u016bd of Ghazni besieged the fort, but came to terms with the R\u0101j\u0101. The Chandel clan of R\u0101jputs removed the seat of their government from Mah\u014db\u0101 to K\u0101linjar after their defeat by Prithwi R\u0101j, the Chauh\u0101n ruler of Delhi, about 1182. In 1203 Kutb-ud-d\u012bn, the viceroy of Muhammad Ghori, took K\u0101linjar, and 'converted the temples into mosques and abodes of goodness,' while 'the very name of idolatry was annihilated.' But the Musalm\u0101ns do not seem to have long retained possession of their new conquest;\nfor in 1234, and again in 1251, we hear of fresh Muhammadan attacks on K\u0101linjar, which fell into the hands of Malik Nusrat-ud-d\u012bn with a great booty. In 1247 Sult\u0101n N\u0101sir-ud-d\u012bn Mahm\u016bd brought the surrounding country under his sway; but even after this date, Chandel inscriptions erected in the fort show that it remained in the hands of its ancient masters almost up to the close of the thirteenth century.\n\nK\u0101linjar next reappears in history in 1530, when the Mughal prince, Hum\u0101y\u016bn, son of B\u0101bar, laid siege to the fort, which he continued intermittently to attack during ten years. In 1545 the Afgh\u0101n, Sher Sh\u0101h, marched against the stronghold; during the siege a live shell rebounded from the walls into the battery where the Sult\u0101n stood, and set fire to a quantity of gunpowder. Sher Sh\u0101h was brought out horribly burnt, and died the following day. Before his death, however, he ordered an assault, which was executed with instant success, and his son, Jal\u0101l Kh\u0101n, was crowned in the captured citadel and assumed the name of Isl\u0101m Sh\u0101h. In 1569 Majn\u016bn Kh\u0101n attacked the fort, which was finally surrendered to him for Akbar, who constituted it the head-quarters of a sark\u0101r. Under Akbar, K\u0101linjar formed a j\u0101g\u012br of the imperial favourite, R\u0101j\u0101 Birbal. Later it fell into the hands of the Bundel\u0101s (see B\u0101nd\u0101 District); and on the death of their national hero, Chhatars\u0101l, it passed into the possession of Hardeo S\u0101h of Pann\u0101. His descendants continued to hold it for several generations, when they gave way to the family of Kaim J\u012b, one of their own dependants.\n\nDuring the period of Mar\u0101th\u0101 supremacy, Al\u012b Bah\u0101dur laid siege to the fort for two years, but without success. After the British occupation Daryau Singh, the representative of Kaim J\u012b, was confirmed in possession of the fort and territory. But on his proving contumacious in 1812, a force under Colonel Martindell attacked K\u0101linjar; and although he failed to take the place by storm, Daryau Singh surrendered eight days later, receiving an equal portion of territory in the plains. During the Mutiny, a small British garrison retained possession of the fort throughout the whole rebellion, aided by the R\u0101j\u0101 of Pann\u0101. In 1866 the fortifications were dismantled.\n\nThe summit of the rock is between 4 and 5 miles in circuit, and is fortified by a rampart rising from the very edge. Access is obtained by a sloping pathway and flight of steps passing through seven gateways, several of which bear inscriptions. Numerous rock-cut tanks and a few remains of temples are to be seen on the plateau, and religious carvings and inscriptions are scattered about, some of which have yielded valuable historical results. One temple, dedicated to Nilkanth, is still in good repair. There are also many caves, some of which contain inscriptions.\nThe town is locally known as Taraht\u012b, and is situated at the foot of the hill. It is now of small importance; but the ruins of fine residences and many old remains prove it to have been once rich and important. Taraht\u012b contains a dispensary, and was till recently administered under Act XX of 1856, but its importance is decreasing. There is a village school.\n\n[Journal, Asiatic Society of Bengal, vol. xvii, pp. 171 and 313; Cunningham, Archaeological Survey Reports, vol. xxi, p. 20.]\n\nK\u0101linjara.\u2014Village in the State of B\u0101nsw\u0101ra, R\u0101jput\u0101na, situated in 23\u00b0 21' N. and 74\u00b0 19' E., on the right bank of the H\u0101ran stream, a tributary of the An\u0101s, 17 miles south-west of the capital. It was formerly a place of considerable trade carried on by Jain merchants, who were driven away by Mar\u0101th\u0101 freebooters. It is now the headquarters of the southern of the two districts into which the State has been recently divided, and possesses a small Hindi school attended by about 20 boys. The place is remarkable as containing the ruins of a fine Jain temple, described by Heber as being built on a very complicated and extensive plan. It is covered with numerous domes and pyramids and divided into a great number of apartments, roofed with stone, crowded with images, and profusely embellished with rich and elaborate carvings.\n\n[Bishop Heber, Narrative of a Journey through the Upper Provinces of India, vol. ii (1828).]\n\nK\u0101li Sind.\u2014Tributary of the Chambal, draining part of Central India and R\u0101jput\u0101na. It rises in the Vindhyas in 22\u00b0 36' N. and 76\u00b0 25' E., at the village of Barjhiri, and flows for about 180 miles through the Gwalior, Dew\u0101s, Narsinghgarh, and Indore States in Central India, after which it traverses Kotah and Jh\u0101law\u0101r in R\u0101jput\u0101na, piercing the Mukandw\u0101ra hills near G\u0101agraun, and falls into the Chambal, 225 miles from its source, near the village of Pipara in Kotah State (25\u00b0 32' N. and 76\u00b0 19' E.). Its principal tributaries are the Lakundar in Central India, and the P\u0101rw\u0101n, Ujar, and Ahu in R\u0101jput\u0101na. Though a perennial stream, the volume of water is small except in the rains, and several roads cross the river by causeways. The Ujjain-Bhop\u0101l Railway, however, passes over a bridge near the K\u0101li Sind station. Water for irrigation is raised from its bed in the upper part of its course, but lower down the banks become too steep. The river is frequently referred to in Sanskrit literature, and is mentioned by Abul Fazl as one of the principal rivers of M\u0101lw\u0101. S\u0101rangpur and G\u0101agraun are the principal places on its banks. It is probable that K\u0101li ('black') Sind derives its name from the prevalence of black basalt in its bed.\n\nK\u0101lka.\u2014Town attached for administrative purposes to the Kharar tahsil of Amb\u0101la District, Punjab, situated in 30\u00b0 50' N. and 76\u00b0 57' E.,\nat the foot of the outlying range of the Him\u0101layas at an elevation of 2,400 feet, and entirely surrounded by Pati\u0101la territory. It is the junction of the Delhi-Umballa-K\u0101lka and K\u0101lka-Simla Railways. Population (1901), 7,045. K\u0101lka was acquired from Pati\u0101la in 1843 as a d\u00e9p\u00f4t for Simla; it is also an important market for hill produce, such as ginger and turmeric. There is a considerable manufacture of millstones, and a railway workshop is situated here, which employed 200 hands in 1904. It is administered as a \u2018notified area.\u2019\n\nKallakurchi.\u2014Western t\u0101luk of South Arcot District, Madras, lying between 11\u00b0 34\u2032 and 12\u00b0 4\u2032 N. and 78\u00b0 38\u2032 and 79\u00b0 13\u2032 E., with an area of 873 square miles. The Kalr\u0101yans, one of the only two hill-ranges in the District, skirt its western border, and south of them the At\u016br pass leads into Salem District. The population in 1901 was 269,377, having risen from 239,405 in 1891. There are no towns; but it contains 367 villages, of which Kallakurchi, the head-quarters, is situated on the trunk road from Cuddalore to Salem. It is the second largest t\u0101luk in the District, and the second most sparsely peopled. The demand for land revenue and cesses in 1903\u20134 amounted to Rs. 4,92,000. In the hills in the west rise several small streams, which are utilized for irrigation by means of rough stone dams. The hill villages, which number 96, are divided into three p\u0101laiyams or estates. The polig\u0101rs or chiefs obtain their revenue chiefly by leasing out the forests and by a poll-tax on their tenants, who are all Malaiy\u0101lis by caste. There is no irrigated cultivation on the hills; the principal \u2018dry crops\u2019 grown are r\u0101gi, cambu, tinai (Setaria italica, a poor kind of millet), and varagu. Bamboos and timber of various kinds are taken down to the plains, and sold for house-building and other purposes.\n\nKalli\u0101npur.\u2014Village in the Udupi t\u0101luk of South Kanara District, Madras, situated in 13\u00b0 24\u2032 N. and 74\u00b0 44\u2032 E. It is conjectured to have been the Kalliana mentioned by Cosmas Indicopleustes as the seat of a bishop in the sixth century. It is also the reputed birthplace of Madhv\u0101ch\u0101rya, the Vaishnavite reformer, who was born about A.D. 1199. The Portuguese established a factory here in 1678.\n\nKallidaikurichi.\u2014Town in the Amb\u0101samudram t\u0101luk of Tinnevelly District, Madras, situated in 8\u00b0 41\u2032 N. and 77\u00b0 27\u2032 E., on the T\u0101mbraparni river. It is a Union, with a population (1901) of 14,913. It contains a large number of Br\u0101hmans, several of whom are engaged in a flourishing cloth trade with Travancore, while others are also bankers. The fields around the town are well watered and very valuable.\n\nKallikota and Atagada.\u2014Two permanently settled estates in Ganjam District, Madras, lying between 19\u00b0 28\u2032 and 19\u00b0 52\u2032 N. and 84\u00b0 43\u2032 and 85\u00b0 12\u2032 E., on the northern boundary of the Presidency.\nWhile the former is impartible, the latter is partible, and was acquired in 1854 by the zamindar of Kallikota by purchase at a sale for arrears of revenue. The joint area of the two is 507 square miles and their population (1901) 169,693. The peshkash and cesses payable by them in 1903-4 amounted to Rs. 1,11,000. The chief village, Kallikota, is beautifully situated in a basin surrounded by hills.\n\nThe Kallikota family was founded by R\u0101mabhuya, who was made a zamindar by the Gajapati king of Orissa, Purushottama. At a later period he obtained the title of Mardar\u0101j\u0101 Deo for his services in keeping the Mar\u0101th\u0101s out of the country. In 1769 the estate was in a disturbed condition and was occupied by British troops, and from 1771 to 1775 troops were again employed in maintaining order.\n\nThe soil is fertile and well irrigated, and yields good crops. The prevailing tenure is must\u0101jiri, under which the villages are rented out to middlemen who collect the assessment. The rent payable by the tenant to the landlord is generally half the gross produce.\n\nThe present Raj\u0101 succeeded in 1887 as a minor, and the estates were managed for the next five years by the Court of Wards. During this period Rs. 93,000 was spent on repairs to irrigation works, Rs. 1,34,000 of debt was cleared off, and the property was handed over to its owner in 1893 in a flourishing condition, with an income which had been increased from Rs. 2,41,000 to Rs. 3,17,000, and with a cash balance of Rs. 2,11,000. Within the next ten years the Raj\u0101 had dissipated this balance, incurred further debts, and mortgaged the two estates to his creditors.\n\nKall\u016br T\u0101luka (formerly called Madhra). Southern t\u0101luk of Warangal District, Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State, north of the Kistna District of Madras, with an area of 966 square miles. The population in 1901, including j\u0101girs, was 103,829, compared with 92,738 in 1891. The t\u0101luk contains 184 villages, of which 25 are j\u0101gir; and Kall\u016br (population, 2,741) is the head-quarters. The land revenue in 1901 was 2\u00bd lakhs. The Niz\u0101m\u2019s Guaranteed State Railway passes through the t\u0101luk from north-west to south-east. Rice is largely cultivated near tanks. The diamond mines of Partyal are situated in this t\u0101luk.\n\nKall\u016br Town.\u2014Town in the Raich\u016br t\u0101luk of Raich\u016br District, Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State, situated in 16\u00b0 9' N. and 77\u00b0 13' E., 10 miles west of Raich\u016br town. It has three temples built of stone, all in good preservation, and two mosques. Population (1901), 6,456.\n\nKalmeshwar.\u2014Town in the District and taluk of N\u0101gpur, Central Provinces, situated in 21\u00b0 14' N. and 78\u00b0 56' E., 13 miles west of N\u0101gpur city by road. Kalmeshwar is supposed to have been founded by nomad Ahirs or herdsmen, and the name is derived from that of their god Kalma. Population (1901), 5,340. The town stands on black soil, lying low, with bad natural drainage. On a small eminence in its\ncentre is an old fortress, said to have been built by a Hindu family from Delhi in the time of Bakht Buland. Kalmeshwar was constituted a municipality in 1867. The municipal income during the decade ending 1901 averaged Rs. 4,400. In 1903-4 the income was Rs. 5,000, mainly derived from a house tax and market dues. A weekly cattle market is held, and there is some trade in grain and oilseeds. Cotton cloth is woven by hand. There is an English middle school.\n\nK\u0101lna Subdivision.\u2014South-eastern subdivision of Burdw\u0101n District, Bengal, lying between $23^\\circ 7'$ and $23^\\circ 36'$ N. and $88^\\circ 0'$ and $88^\\circ 25'$ E., with an area of 399 square miles. This subdivision, like the adjoining subdivision of K\u0101tw\u0101, is flat and alluvial, and the eastern portion along the bank of the Bh\u0101girathi is low-lying and marshy. The population in 1901 was 233,269, compared with 231,512 in 1891, the density being 585 persons per square mile. It contains one town, K\u0101lna (population, 8,121), its head-quarters; and 698 villages. N\u0101dangh\u0101t possesses a large river trade in rice.\n\nK\u0101lna Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the subdivision of the same name in Burdw\u0101n District, Bengal, situated in $23^\\circ 13'$ N. and $88^\\circ 22'$ E., on the right bank of the Bh\u0101girathi. Population (1901), 8,121. K\u0101lna was a place of great importance in Muhammadan times, and the ruins of a large fort which commanded the river are still to be seen. It was formerly the port which supplied the District, and steamers still visit it throughout the year; but it has suffered owing to the competition with the East Indian Railway, and its population has declined. A conspicuous feature of the town is a group of 109 Siva lingam temples, which were built in 1809. K\u0101lna was constituted a municipality in 1869. The income during the decade ending 1901-2 averaged Rs. 13,000, and the expenditure Rs. 11,000. In 1903-4 the income was Rs. 16,000, of which Rs. 4,000 was derived from a tax on persons (or property tax) and Rs. 4,000 from a tax on vehicles, &c.; and the expenditure was Rs. 14,000. The town contains the usual public offices; the subsidiary jail has accommodation for 20 prisoners.\n\nK\u0101lni.\u2014River in Assam. See Surm\u0101.\n\nK\u0101l\u014dl T\u0101luka (1).\u2014Southern t\u0101luka of the Kadi pr\u0101nt, Baroda State, with an area of 267 square miles. The population fell from 97,089 in 1891 to 80,532 in 1901. It contains one town, K\u0101l\u014dl (population, 6,465), the head-quarters; and 88 villages. The t\u0101luka presents the appearance of a fairly wooded and well-cultivated plain. The S\u0101bar-mati river just touches its western boundary. The surface soil is gor\u0101t, or of a light sandy nature. In 1904-5 the land revenue was Rs. 2,15,000.\n\nK\u0101l\u014dl Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the t\u0101luka of the same name, Kadi pr\u0101nt, Baroda State, situated in $23^\\circ 15'$ N. and $72^\\circ 32'$ E., on the\nR\u0101jput\u0101na-M\u0101lw\u0101 Railway. Gaikw\u0101r's State lines run from here to Vijapur on one side, and to Kadi on the other. Population (1901), 6,465. K\u0101l\u014dl contains Munsif's and magistrate's courts, a dispensary, a vernacular school, and local offices. An annual grant of Rs. 1,300 is made to the municipality. The town is the centre of a considerable trade in grain.\n\nK\u0101l\u014dl T\u0101luka (2).\u2014Southern t\u0101luka of the western portion of P\u0101nch Mah\u0101ls District, Bombay, including the petty subdivision (petha) of H\u0101l\u014dl, lying between 22\u00b0 15' and 22\u00b0 44' N. and 73\u00b0 22' and 73\u00b0 44' E., with an area of 41.4 square miles. It contains one town, K\u0101l\u014dl (population, 4,446), the head-quarters; and 252 villages. Population in 1901 was 73,796, compared with 87,851 in 1891, the decrease being due to famine. The density, 178 persons per square mile, slightly exceeds the District average. K\u0101l\u014dl forms a rich well-wooded plain; its fields fenced with hedges and rows of brab palms; its villages compact and comfortable. Three rivers cross the t\u0101luka: from east to west the Mesri in the north, the Goma in the centre, and the Kar\u0101d in the south. These rivers become torrents in the rains, and trickling streams in the cold season. Light or gor\u0101du soil lies all over this part of the country: the black cotton soil is not met with. The petty division of H\u0101l\u014dl is a well-wooded and tilled plain surrounding the hill fort of P\u0101v\u0101garh. To the east and south, low isolated hills stand out from a rich black-soil plain, most of it waste. Within 4 or 5 miles of the hills the climate is unhealthy and the water often deleterious. Three rivers, the Kar\u0101d, Visv\u0101mitri, and Devnadi, cross H\u0101l\u014dl from east to west. Water lies near the surface. Cultivation is rude, and the peasantry inert. The annual rainfall averages 37 inches. Land revenue (including H\u0101l\u014dl) and cesses in 1903-4 amounted to more than 1.1 lakhs.\n\nK\u0101lp\u012b Tahsil.\u2014Eastern tahsil of J\u0101laun District, United Provinces, conterminous with the pargana of the same name, lying between 25\u00b0 53' and 26\u00b0 22' N. and 79\u00b0 25' and 79\u00b0 52' E., with an area of 407 square miles. Population fell from 78,754 in 1891 to 75,692 in 1901. There are 154 villages and one town, K\u0101lp\u012b (population, 10,139), the tahsil headquarters. The demand for land revenue in 1903-4 was Rs. 1,55,000, and for cesses Rs. 25,000. The density of population, 186 persons per square mile, is the lowest in the District. The tahsil is bounded on the north-east by the Jumna and on the south by the Betwa, while several small drainage channels enter it from the west and unite to form a stream called the Non. In the south-west the soil is inferior m\u0101r, and this tract has recently suffered from bad seasons and is overgrown with k\u0101ns (Saccharum spontaneum). Near the Jumna the soil becomes lighter, and on the banks of the vast system of ravines which fringe that river and the smaller streams denudation has reduced the\nfertility of the land. In 1899-1900 the area under cultivation was 158 square miles, of which only 9 were irrigated.\n\nK\u0101lp\u012b Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the tahsil of the same name in J\u0101laun District, United Provinces, situated in 26\u00b0 8' N. and 79\u00b0 45' E., on the Jumna, on the road from Cawnpore and Saugor, and on the Great Indian Peninsula Railway. Population (1901), 10,139.\n\nAccording to tradition K\u0101lp\u012b was founded in the fourth century by one B\u0101sdeo. It fell into the hands of Kutb-ud-din in 1196, and at once became an important fortress of the Musalm\u0101ns. In the fifteenth century Ibr\u0101h\u012bm Sh\u0101h of Jaunpur made two unsuccessful attempts to seize K\u0101lp\u012b, and in 1435 Hoshang Sh\u0101h of M\u0101lw\u0101 captured the place. A few years later Ibr\u0101h\u012bm's successor, Mahm\u016bd, was allowed to occupy the town on the plea of chastising the governor. He plundered it, and then refused to restore it to the king of M\u0101lw\u0101, but afterwards came to terms. In the struggle between the Jaunpur kingdom and the rulers of Delhi, which ended with the extinction of the former, a great battle took place near K\u0101lp\u012b in 1477, and Husain Sh\u0101h of Jaunpur fled to Kanauj, where he was again defeated. When the victory at P\u0101n\u012bpat in 1526 laid open the plains of Hindust\u0101n to B\u0101bar, the R\u0101n\u0101 of Chitor and the Afgh\u0101ns combined to stop his advance, and occupied K\u0101lp\u012b, but were met near the site of Fatehpur Sikri, as they marched on Agra, and defeated. K\u0101lp\u012b was taken in 1527 by Hum\u0101y\u016bn after his conquest of Jaunpur and Bih\u0101r, and held till 1540, when the Mughals were defeated by Sher Sh\u0101h at Kanauj. It was again the scene of fierce contests in the struggles which sapped the Afgh\u0101n strength before the return to power of the Mughals. Under Akbar K\u0101lp\u012b became the head-quarters of a sark\u0101r, which included the adjacent parts of the present Districts of Et\u0101wah, Cawnpore, and Hamirpur, besides J\u0101laun and portions of the State of Gwalior. When the Mar\u0101th\u0101s acquired part of Bundelkhand early in the eighteenth century, K\u0101lp\u012b became the head-quarters of their governor. In 1798 the town was captured by the British, but was subsequently abandoned. It again fell into their power, after a few hours' resistance, in 1803, and was granted to Himmat Bah\u0101dur. He died in the following year and the grant lapsed, when the town was made over to Gobind Rao of J\u0101laun, who exchanged it in 1806. After the large District of Bundelkhand was divided into two portions, K\u0101lp\u012b was for a time the head-quarters of the northern division, afterwards called Ham\u012brpur District. During the Mutiny a great victory was won near here, in May, 1858, by Sir Hugh Rose over a force of 12,000 rebels under the R\u0101n\u012b of Jh\u0101nsi, the Rao S\u0101hib, and the Naw\u0101b of Band\u0101, which did much to quell the rebellion in Bundelkhand.\n\nThe town is situated among the ravines of the Jumna, and after a long period of decay is again reviving in importance. The western\noutskirt contains a number of old tombs, notably that called the Chaur\u0101s\u012b Gumbaz (or 'eighty-four domes'); but ravines now separate these relics of the past from the dwellings of the living. Old K\u0101lpi stands near the river on an elevated site, and is a good specimen of the older type of North Indian town, with darkened plaster walls and flat roofs interspersed with trees, and here and there a temple spire or a Muhammadan dome. The newer portion of the town stretches south-east, and is lower and farther from the river. On the most prominent edge of the steep bank stand the ruins of a fort, but only a single building has survived. This is a masonry room with walls 9 feet thick, said to have been the treasury of the Mar\u0101th\u0101 governor. A fine flight of steps leads from the fort to a bathing gh\u0101\u1e6d on the river. A few years ago a lofty tower was built by a local pleader, which is adorned with representations of the battles of the R\u0101m\u0101yana. It is noteworthy that less prominence is given to R\u0101ma than to R\u0101vana his adversary, who is represented as a gigantic many-armed figure, of dignified aspect, about 80 feet in height. The chief public buildings are the tahsil\u012b and dispensary.\n\nK\u0101lpi has been a municipality since 1868. During the ten years ending 1901 the income and expenditure averaged Rs. 11,000. In 1903\u20134 the income was Rs. 14,000, chiefly derived from octroi (Rs. 9,000): and the expenditure was Rs. 14,000. For many years K\u0101lpi was a great trade centre. Cotton and grain were brought from the south, and sent away to Cawnpore or down the Jumna to Mirzapur and Calcutta, while the manufactures of sugar-candy and paper were celebrated. The buildings of the East India Company's cotton factory, which was one of the principal stations for providing the annual investment, are still standing. As railways spread and trade routes altered, Kalpi declined, but its commerce is now again increasing. Grain is sent to Southern and Western India, gh\u012b to Bengal, and cotton to Cawnpore or Bombay. Two small cotton-gins have recently been opened, and the Forest department is starting plantations of babul for the supply of bark to the Cawnpore tanneries. The tahsil\u012b school has 111 pupils, and there are three municipal schools with 170, and a girls' school with 19.\n\nK\u0101lra.\u2014Estate in the District and tahsil\u012b of Sh\u0101hpur, Punjab, with an area of 13 square miles. For services in the Mutiny a member of the Tiw\u0101na family of Mitha Tiw\u0101na, named Malik S\u0101hib Kh\u0101n, Kh\u0101n Bah\u0101dur, C.S.I., obtained a grant of 8,700 acres of waste land in the Sh\u0101hpur tahsil\u012b. To irrigate this he constructed a canal, and the estate is now a most valuable one. His son, Malik Umar Hay\u0101t, succeeded in 1879. The Malik also owns estates in Sh\u0101hpur, Jhelum, and Lyallpur Districts, aggregating nearly 13,000 acres, and the whole property yields an income of about 2 lakhs. Recently the\nMalik obtained a horse-breeding grant of 2,270 acres in the Jhelum Colony.\n\nKalr\u0101yan Hills.\u2014These hills are situated partly in the At\u016br and Uttangari t\u0101luks of Salem District and partly in South Arcot District, Madras, lying between $11^\\circ 38'$ and $12^\\circ 4'$ N. and $78^\\circ 28'$ and $78^\\circ 49'$ E. They stand east of the Tenandamalai, being separated from it by the Kottapatti valley, and are perhaps the largest in superficial extent of the hill ranges in Salem District. Different portions of the range have local names, but the principal divisions are the Periya ('big') Kalr\u0101yans, which attain an elevation of 4,300 feet, and the Chinna ('little') Kalr\u0101yans, reaching to little above 3,000 feet. The temple of Kari R\u0101man in the Periya Kalr\u0101yans is held in great reverence by the Malaiy\u0101lis who inhabit these hills. The range is parcelled out into five j\u012bgirs or estates, the owners of which govern their tenants in a primitive and patriarchal fashion. The fever on the range is so dreaded that few dwellers on the plains ever go up it, and consequently the people have retained many curious customs which differ from those of the low country. They are exclusively of the caste known as Malaiy\u0101lis; but there is no doubt that they are not a distinct race, but merely Tamils who at some remote period took refuge in these hills from the troublous times through which the plains were passing.\n\nK\u0101lsi.\u2014Town in the Chakr\u0101t\u0101 tahs\u012bl of Dehra D\u016bn District, United Provinces, situated in $30^\\circ 32'$ N. and $77^\\circ 51'$ E., close to the confluence of the Jumna and the Tons, on the military road from Sah\u0101ranpur to Chakr\u0101t\u0101, 52 miles from the former and 25 miles from the latter. Three miles away the road crosses the Jumna by an iron girder-bridge. Population (1901), 760. The place has declined owing to the transfer of the tahs\u012bl head-quarters to Chakr\u0101t\u0101. K\u0101lsi is administered under Act XX of 1856, the annual income and expenditure amounting to Rs. 300 or Rs. 400. It is chiefly remarkable for a large quartz boulder in the neighbourhood on which are sculptured the celebrated edicts of Asoka; one of these gives the names of contemporary kings in Western Asia, Greece, and Egypt\u00b9.\n\nKalsia.\u2014Native State in the Punjab, under the political control of the Commissioner, Delhi Division. It comprises twenty detached pieces of territory in Amb\u0101la and Ferozepore Districts, lying mainly between $30^\\circ 12'$ and $30^\\circ 25'$ N. and $77^\\circ 21'$ and $77^\\circ 35'$ E. The present Sard\u0101r of the State, Ranjit Singh, is a descendant of Sard\u0101r Gurbakhsh Singh, a Jat of Kalsia near Lahore, who joined the Kroria misl or confederacy of the Sikhs. His son Jodh Singh, a man of ability and prowess, effected considerable conquests on both sides of the Sutlej, but eventually the family lost all those north of the river. When the Cis-Sutlej States came under British protection, Sard\u0101r Jodh\n\n\u00b9 Corpus Inscriptionum Indicarum, vol. i, pp. 12 and 117.\nSingh, after some hesitation, followed the general example. The State has an area of 168 square miles, and a population (1901) of 67,131. It is divided into two tahsils, Chhachhrauli and Basi, with the isolated sub-tahsil of Chirak, in Ferozepore District. It contains two towns, Chhachhrauli (population, 5,520) and Basi (4,641); and 181 villages. In 1903-4 the revenue amounted to 1.9 lakhs, of which 1.2 lakhs was land revenue. The State was regularly settled in 1891. It had suffered considerably from over-assessment, and its people had been impoverished. The excise administration is leased to the British Government for Rs. 6,000 per annum.\n\nKalsubai.\u2014Hill in Ahmadnagar District, Bombay, situated in 19\u00b0 36' N. and 73\u00b0 42' E., 5,427 feet high, and the most elevated point in the Deccan. Its summit is crowned by a temple, 10 miles south-east of Igatpuri, a station on the north-east branch of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway. A priest of Devi Kalsu daily climbs to the temple from Indor, a village at the foot of the hill, to offer a sacrifice of fowls. The shrine is visited by large numbers of Kolis.\n\nKalugumalai (kalugu, 'an eagle,' and malai, 'a hill').\u2014Village in the Ettaiyapuram zamindari and the Ottappidaram taluk of Tinnevelly District, Madras, situated in 9\u00b0 8' N. and 77\u00b0 42' E., 28 miles north of Tinnevelly town and 12 miles from Sankaranayinarkovil. Population (1901), 4,827. It contains a celebrated rock-cut temple dedicated to the god Subrahmanya, and many Jain sculptures and inscriptions. The temple is similar in style to the Seven Pagodas in Chingleput District, and is thought to have been built in the tenth or eleventh century. An annual festival and cattle fair in February attract a large number of people from the southern Districts and even from Mysore.\n\nKalukhera.\u2014Thakurat in the Malwa Agency, Central India.\n\nKalvakurti.\u2014Eastern taluk of Mahbubnagar District, Hyderab\u0101d State, with an area of 583 square miles. The population in 1901, including jagirs, was 54,384, compared with 52,132 in 1891. The taluk in 1901 contained 101 villages, of which 31 are jagir, and Kalvakurti (population, 2,230) is the head-quarters. The land revenue was Rs. 85,000. In 1905 this taluk received some additions from the adjoining taluk of Jedcherla, and now contains 99 khalsa villages.\n\nKalvan.\u2014North-western taluka of Nasik District, Bombay, lying between 20\u00b0 21' and 20\u00b0 42' N. and 73\u00b0 40' and 74\u00b0 20' E., with an area of 494 square miles. There are 188 villages, but no town. The population in 1901 was 53,616, compared with 60,417 in 1891. The density, 109 persons per square mile, is much below the District average. The head-quarters are at Kalvan. The demand for land revenue in 1903-4 was Rs. 91,000, and for cesses Rs. 6,000. The\nwest is covered with steep bare hills; towards the east the country, though flatter and more fertile, is divided by a spur running south-east from the Western Ghats; in the south rises the high and rugged Sapta-shring range, with its lower slopes fringed with teak. The annual rainfall averages 25 inches.\n\nKaly\u0101n Taluka.\u2014Southern taluka of Th\u0101na District, Bombay, lying between 19\u00b0 4' and 19\u00b0 24' N. and 73\u00b0 1' and 73\u00b0 24' E., with an area of 276 square miles. It contains one town, KALY\u0100N (population, 10,749), the head-quarters; and 224 villages. The population in 1901 was 77,087, compared with 80,171 in 1891. The density is 279 persons per square mile, or rather more than the District average. Land revenue and cesses in 1903-4 amounted to 2.2 lakhs. The taluka is triangular in form, and in its western part a rich open plain. In the south and east, ranges of hills running parallel with the boundary line throw out spurs into the heart of the plain. The transport of produce is facilitated by the tidal creek of the Ulh\u0101s river and by the Great Indian Peninsula Railway. The river K\u0101lu is navigable by boats of 10 tons for 9 miles above Kaly\u0101n town. There are disagreeable east winds in April and May; but although fever is prevalent in the cold season, the climate is on the whole temperate and healthy.\n\nKaly\u0101n Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the taluka of the same name in Th\u0101na District, Bombay, situated in 19\u00b0 14' N. and 73\u00b0 10' E., at the junction of the north-east and south-east lines of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, 33 miles north-east of Bombay. Population (1901), 10,749. Kaly\u0101n has been a municipality since 1855. The municipal income during the decade ending 1901 averaged Rs. 19,000. In 1903-4 the income was Rs. 19,579. It has a considerable rice-husking trade, carried on by Muhammadans and some Mar\u0101th\u0101s. This industry gives occupation to about 750 persons, half of whom are women. There is also a trade in tobacco, dried fish, bricks, tiles, and myrabolams. The streets and lanes in the town are metalled, and kept in clean condition. A ferry plies across the Ulh\u0101s river to Kone on the opposite bank. The town has a vegetable market built by the municipality. It is supplied with water from the Shenala lake about a quarter of a mile to the east.\n\nThe name of Kaly\u0101n appears in ancient inscriptions, which have been attributed to the first, second, fifth, or sixth century A.D. According to the Periplus, Kaly\u0101n rose to importance about the end of the second century. Cosmas Indicopleustes, in the sixth century, mentions it as one of the five chief marts of Western India, the seat of a powerful king, with a trade in brass, black-wood logs, and articles of clothing. Early in the fourteenth century the Muhammadans found Kaly\u0101n the capital of a district, and gave it the name of Isl\u0101m\u0101b\u0101d.\nIt was taken by the Portuguese in 1536. They did not garrison the town, but, returning in 1579, burnt the suburbs and carried off much booty. From this time it seems to have formed part of the Ahmadnagar kingdom. In 1648 Sivaji's general, Ab\u0101j\u012b Sondeo, surprised Kaly\u0101n and took the governor prisoner. The Muhammadans recovered the town in 1660, but again lost it in 1662. In 1674 Sivaji granted the English leave to establish a factory. The Mar\u0101th\u0101s in 1780 having cut off their supplies, Kaly\u0101n was seized by the British, and has since remained in their possession. Objects of interest are the Shenali tank, said to have been built in 1505; the tomb of Motabar Kh\u0101n, minister of Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n, who was sent in disgrace to Kaly\u0101n when Aurangzeb usurped his father's throne; and seven mosques, of which the graceful K\u0101li Masjid is the most noteworthy. The town contains a Sub-Judge's court, a dispensary, an English school with 87 pupils, 7 vernacular schools for boys with 358 pupils, and one for girls with 96. There are also a library, a small printing press, and a rice-husking mill.\n\nKalyandrug Taluk.\u2014Westernmost taluk of Anantapur District, Madras, lying between 14\u00b0 14' and 14\u00b0 44' N. and 76\u00b0 51' and 77\u00b0 23' E., with an area of 817 square miles. The population in 1901 was 76,977, compared with 72,730 in 1891. Originally part of the Dharmavaram taluk, it was separated at the end of 1893. It contains 70 villages and one town, Kalyandrug (population, 8,815), the head-quarters. The demand for land revenue and cesses in 1903-4 amounted to Rs. 1,30,000. No less than 88 per cent. of the 'dry' land pays an assessment of four annas or less per acre. The taluk is rocky and barren, the soil stony and very poor, and the rainfall less than 21 inches per annum. Consequently it is bare and uninviting, and the density of population is less than 100 per square mile, being lower than in any taluk in the Presidency except those which are covered with hill and forest. The northern portion has a little black cotton soil and is slightly richer.\n\nKalyandrug Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the taluk of the same name in Anantapur District, Madras, situated in 14\u00b0 33' N. and 77\u00b0 6' E. Population (1901), 8,815. It was formerly a place of some importance, containing a District Munsif's court, but now, being off the railway and in the centre of a very barren tract, it is in a decaying state. It lies in a hollow surrounded by hills, two of which are 2,400 feet high. The ruins of an old fort and the buildings connected therewith still stand, but are of no antiquarian interest. On the higher of the two hills above referred to, and in the neighbouring village of Mudigallu, are some hundreds of prehistoric kistvaens. On the hill are also three curious circular mounds of earth, about 3 feet in height and some 10 or 11 yards in diameter. All round them are planted, upright in\nthe earth, slabs of stone of irregular shape, which stand from 4 to 5 feet above the ground.\n\n**Kaly\u0101ni.**\u2014A *j\u0101gir* town in Bidar District, Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State, situated in 17\u00b0 53' N. and 76\u00b0 57' E., 36 miles west of Bidar town. Population (1901), 11,191. About the middle of the eleventh century Someshwar I made Kaly\u0101ni the capital of the Ch\u0101lukyan kingdom. A hundred years later the power was usurped by Bijjala Kalachuri, the commander-in-chief, and before the close of the twelfth century the Ch\u0101lukya power was at an end. While Kaly\u0101ni remained a great capital, it was noted as the residence of Vijn\u0101neshwar, the author of the treatise on law known as the *Mit\u0101kshara*, and of Basava who founded the Ling\u0101yat sect. Further particulars about Basava and the Ling\u0101yats will be found in the article on Mysore State. The Kalachuris were succeeded by the Y\u0101davas of Deogiri (Daulat\u0101b\u0101d); and after the establishment of the Bahmani dynasty, Kaly\u0101ni passed into their possession in the fourteenth century, and subsequently into that of Bij\u0101pur. The Mughals sacked it in 1653. In 1656 Aurangzeb invested the fortress, which surrendered after an heroic defence. During the contests which followed the decline of Ch\u0101lukyan power, and the struggles between various Muhammadan rulers, the magnificent temples which once adorned the place were demolished or converted into mosques.\n\n**Kama.**\u2014South-western township of Thayetmyo District, Burma, lying between 18\u00b0 52' and 19\u00b0 18' N. and 94\u00b0 39' and 95\u00b0 13' E., and extending from the Irrawaddy in the east to the Arakan Yoma on the west. The area of the township, which is intersected by low hills, is 575 square miles, and it contains 201 villages. The population in 1891 was 41,383, and in 1901, in consequence of emigration to the delta, it had fallen to 39,570 (including 2,500 Chins). The headquarters are at Kama (population, 1,779), a village situated on low hills on the right or western bank of the Irrawaddy. In 1903\u20134 the area under cultivation was 50 square miles, paying Rs. 53,000 land revenue.\n\n**K\u0101ma.**\u2014*Tahsil* and head-quarters thereof in Bharatpur State, R\u0101jput\u0101na. See K\u0100MAN.\n\n**Kamadhia.**\u2014Petty State in K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r, Bombay.\n\n**Kamaing.**\u2014North-western township of Myitkyin\u0101 District, Upper Burma, lying between 25\u00b0 36' and 26\u00b0 N. and 96\u00b0 and 97\u00b0 E., with an area of 2,650 square miles. The population in 1901 was only 9,687, half of whom were Kachins, a fourth Shans, and one-sixth Burmans. It contains 126 villages, of which all but five are in the Kachin Hill Tracts. Kamaing (population, 1,079), where there is a strong military police post, is the head-quarters. In 1903\u20134 the area cultivated was 600 acres, apart from *taungyas*; but the greater part of the township is forest. The land revenue and *thatthameda* amounted to Rs. 5,000.\nK\u0101makhy\u0101.\u2014A temple, sacred to Sat\u012b, which stands on the beautiful Nil\u0101chal hill overhanging the Brahmaputra, about 2 miles west of Gauh\u0101ti, in K\u0101mr\u016bp District, Eastern Bengal and Assam, in 26\u00b0 10' N. and 91\u00b0 45' E. According to tradition, the temple was originally built by Naraka, a prince who is said to have flourished at the time of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, and to have constructed a stone-paved causeway up the hill, which is still in existence. It was rebuilt by Nar N\u0101r\u0101yan about A.D. 1565, and on the occasion of its consecration 140 human heads were offered to the goddess, but only a small portion of Nar N\u0101r\u0101yan's temple now remains. Sat\u012b's organs of generation are said to have fallen on the place now covered by the temple, and this fact renders the spot an object of pilgrimage to devout Hindus from every part of India. Six other temples stand on the hill, and from the summit a magnificent view is obtained over the river and the surrounding country. A grant of revenue-free land, nearly 8,000 acres in extent, made to the goddess by the native rulers of Assam, has been confirmed by the British Government. The most important festivals are the Pous Bia, about Christmas time, when K\u0101makhy\u0101 is married to K\u0101meswar, and the Basanti and Durga p\u016bj\u0101s, which are celebrated, the former in the spring, the latter in the autumn.\n\nKam\u0101lia (Kot Kam\u0101lia).\u2014Town in the District and tahsil of Montgomery, Punjab, situated in 30\u00b0 43' N. and 72\u00b0 40' E., 27 miles west of Montgomery town, and 14 from Ch\u012bch\u0101watni station on the North-Western Railway. Population (1901), 6,976. It is identified by Cunningham as one of the towns of the Malli taken by Alexander. The modern town was founded by a Kharral chief named Kh\u0101n Kam\u0101l in the fourteenth century. In 1857 the insurgent tribes held the place for a week, and completely sacked it. The municipality was created in 1868. The income during the ten years ending 1902-3 averaged Rs. 9,300, and the expenditure Rs. 8,700. In 1903-4 the income was Rs. 8,800, derived mainly from octroi, and the expenditure Rs. 10,200. Since British annexation a brisk trade in the produce of the R\u0101vi lowlands has sprung up, and the importance of Kam\u0101lia has been immensely increased by the opening of the North-Western Railway. The town is now a place of considerable commerce, dealing in wheat, grain, and pulses from the surrounding villages and Jhang; gur and sugar from Jullundur and Amritsar; piece-goods from Kar\u0101chi, Amritsar, and Delhi. The exports are chiefly cotton, gh\u012b, and wool. Excellent cotton prints and carpets are manufactured. The town contains an Anglo-veracular middle school, a private high school, and a dispensary.\n\nKam\u0101lpur.\u2014Petty State in K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r, Bombay.\n\nKam\u0101lpur.\u2014Thakur\u0101t in the Bh\u014dp\u0101l Agency, Central India.\n\nK\u0101man.\u2014Head quarters of a tahsil of the same name in the State\nof Bharatpur, R\u0101jput\u0101na, situated in 27\u00b0 39' N. and 77\u00b0 16' E., about 36 miles north-by-north-west of Bharatpur city. Population (1901), 12,083. The town contains a vernacular school attended by 140 boys, and a dispensary. The old name of the place is said to have been Kadamba-vana (contracted to K\u0101mavana), from the number of kadamb trees (*Anthocephalus Cadamba*) found here; another account traces its name to a mythical R\u0101j\u0101 K\u0101msen. K\u0101man is one of the twelve holy places of the Braj Mandal (see Muttra District), and its shrine of Gopin\u0101th is regularly visited by pilgrims. In the middle of the town is an old fort, in which are many fragments of Hindu sculpture, and a mosque called Chaur\u0101si Khamb\u0101 ('84 pillars'). None of these pillars is without ornament, and some are very highly decorated. On one of them is a Sanskrit inscription of the S\u016brasenas; it bears no date, but is believed to belong to the eighth century, and records the building of a temple to Vishnu.\n\n[Indian Antiquary, vol. x; Archaeological Survey of Northern India, vol. xx.]\n\nK\u0101m\u0101reddipet.\u2014T\u0101luk in Niz\u0101m\u0101b\u0101d District, Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State. In 1901 the area was 413 square miles, and the population, including j\u0101girs, was 64,933, compared with 63,366 in 1891. The t\u0101luk had 96 villages, of which 25 were j\u0101gir, K\u0101m\u0101reddipet (population, 2,503) being the head-quarters. The land revenue in 1901 was 2-2 lakhs. In 1905 the t\u0101luk was enlarged by the transfer of villages from the Medak and R\u0101m\u0101yampet t\u0101luk of Medak District, and Sirsilla in Karimnagar (formerly Elgandal). It is hilly in some parts.\n\nK\u0101m\u0101rh\u0101ti.\u2014Town in the Barrackpore subdivision of the District of the Twenty-four Parganas, Bengal, situated in 22\u00b0 40' N. and 88\u00b0 23' E., on the east bank of the Hooghly river. Population (1901), 13,216. Within this municipality is the greater part of the village of Dakhineswar, with its group of temples called R\u0101n\u012b R\u0101sm\u0101ni's Nabaratna. These consist of two beautiful central temples, dedicated to K\u0101li and Krishna, faced by twelve minor temples in honour of Siva. K\u0101m\u0101rh\u0101ti was formerly included within the Baranagar municipality, but in 1899 a separate municipality was constituted. The income during the five years since the formation of the separate municipality has averaged Rs. 16,000, and the expenditure Rs. 15,000. In 1903-4 the income was Rs. 17,700, of which Rs. 7,000 was obtained from a tax on houses and lands and Rs. 8,000 from a conservancy rate; and the expenditure was Rs. 16,600.\n\nKam\u0101sin.\u2014Tahsil of B\u0101nd\u0101 District, United Provinces, conterminous with the pargana of the same name, lying along the Jumna between 25\u00b0 17' and 25\u00b0 38' N. and 80\u00b0 47' and 81\u00b0 12' E., with an area of 358 square miles. Population fell from 83,297 in 1891 to 78,773 in 1901. There are 169 villages, but no town. The demand\nfor land revenue in 1903-4 was Rs. 1,18,000, and for cesses Rs. 20,000. The density of population, 220 persons per square mile, is slightly above the District average. Besides the Jumna, the B\u0101ghain and Paisuni drain the tahsil, flowing from south-west to north-east to join the great river. Some of the best cotton produced in the District is grown in Kam\u0101sin. In 1903-4 less than half a square mile was irrigated, out of 205 square miles under cultivation. The Ken Canal, when completed, will serve a small area in the west of this tahsil.\n\nKam\u0101t\u0101pur.\u2014Ruined city in Cooch Beh\u0101r State, Bengal, situated in 26\u00b0 23' N. and 89\u00b0 21' E. The city is reputed to have been founded by R\u0101j\u0101 Niladhwaj, the first of the Khen kings. Its ruins indicate that it must have been a very extensive place. Dr. Buchanan Hamilton in 1809 found that it occupied an area 19 miles in circumference, 5 of which were defended by the Dharl\u0101, and the rest by a rampart and ditch. The city consisted of several enclosures, one within the other, the centre one being occupied by the king's palace. Kam\u0101t\u0101pur was abandoned and fell into decay after the overthrow of R\u0101j\u0101 Nil\u0101mbar by Al\u0101-ud-din Husain, king of Bengal, towards the close of the fifteenth century. Kam\u0101t\u0101pur figures conspicuously as Comotay in some of the earlier maps of India.\n\n[Sir W. W. Hunter, Statistical Account of Bengal (1876), vol. x, pp. 362-70.]\n\nKambam.\u2014T\u0101luk and town in Kurnool District, Madras. See Cumbum.\n\nKambar T\u0101luka.\u2014T\u0101luka of L\u0101rk\u0101na District, Sind, Bombay, lying between 27\u00b0 19' and 27\u00b0 52' N. and 67\u00b0 14' and 68\u00b0 10' E., with an area of 627 square miles, of which about one-fifth is j\u0101g\u012br land belonging to Ghaibi Kh\u0101n Chandia. The population in 1901 was 88,527, compared with 79,019 in 1891. The t\u0101luka contains one town, Kambar (population, 4,807), the head-quarters; and 92 villages. The density, 141 persons per square mile, slightly exceeds the District average. The land revenue and cesses in 1903 amounted to 3-6 lakhs. The t\u0101luka depends upon the Ghar canal and its branches for cultivation. Rice of excellent quality is the principal crop; but owing to excessive irrigation the country is malarious. The same circumstance renders it one of the finest shooting grounds for wild fowl in Northern India.\n\nKambar Town. Head-quarters of the t\u0101luka of the same name in L\u0101rk\u0101na District, Sind, Bombay, situated in 27\u00b0 36' N. and 68\u00b0 3' E., about 12 miles by road west by north from L\u0101rk\u0101na town, and a station on the North-Western Railway. Population (1901), 4,807. The municipality, established in 1862, had an average income during the decade ending 1901 of Rs. 12,300, derived mostly from town dues, cattle-pound fees, and fisheries. In 1903-4 the income was Rs. 17,000.\nThe town was plundered by the Baluchis in 1848, and almost destroyed by fire in the following year. It contains a dispensary, an Anglo-vernacular and a vernacular school, attended respectively by 46 and 93 pupils.\n\n**Kameri.**\u2014Village in the V\u0101lva taluka of S\u0101t\u0101ra District, Bombay, situated in 17\u00b0 N. and 74\u00b0 19' E. Population (1901), 5,052. The village, which lies on the main road to Kolhapur, had formerly a large Muhammadan population. Old tombs and ruined mosques may still be seen, while within its limits is a tank designed to supply water to Isl\u0101mpur.\n\n**Kamilpur.**\u2014Cantonment and head-quarters of Attock District, Punjab. See Campbellpore.\n\n**Kamlagarh.**\u2014Ancient fortress in Mand\u012b State, Punjab, situated in 31\u00b0 48' N. and 76\u00b0 43' E., near the south bank of the Be\u0101s. It consists of a line of detached bastions, castles, and towers, about 3 miles in length, constructed partly of masonry and partly of the natural sandstone rock. The principal stronghold crowns an isolated peak, whose precipitous sides tower 1,500 feet above the Be\u0101s, with double that elevation above sea-level. Kamlagarh played an important part in the earlier history of Mand\u012b, and even Sans\u0101r Chand, R\u0101j\u0101 of Kangra, attacked the fortifications unsuccessfully. Their possession tempted the Mand\u012b R\u0101j\u0101 to revolt against the Sikhs; but General Ventura, the Sikh commander, succeeded in carrying them in 1840, in spite of the popular belief in their impregnability.\n\n**Kampil.**\u2014Village in the Kaimganj tahsil of Farrukhab\u0101d District, United Provinces, situated in 27\u00b0 35' N. and 79\u00b0 14' E., 28 miles north-west of Fatehgarh. Population (1901), 2,366. Kampil is mentioned in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata as the capital of South Panch\u0101la, under king Drupada. Here his daughter, Draupadi, married the five P\u0101ndava brethren. The villagers still show the mound where the R\u0101j\u0101's castle stood, and the place, a few miles away, where the svayamvara, or ceremony at which Draupadi chose her husband, took place. At the end of the thirteenth century, Kampil appears as a nest of highway robbers, against whom the emperor Ghiy\u0101s-ud-din Balban marched a force in person, and built here a fort. The town and its vicinity constantly gave trouble in later years, but the R\u0101thor inhabitants were gradually suppressed. West of the town stretches a long series of ruins in which ancient coins are found. There are a fine Jain temple and a primary school with about 60 pupils.\n\n**Kampli.**\u2014Town in the Hospet taluk of Bellary District, Madras, situated in 15\u00b0 25' N. and 76\u00b0 36' E., on the bank of the Tungabhadra. Population (1901), 9,803. Until 1851 it was the head-quarters of the Hospet (then called the Kampli) taluk, but it is now declining in importance. The town has an ancient history, having been a Ch\u0101lukyan\ncapital in the eleventh century; and its fort, which stands on the river bank at the end of a most picturesque reach, must have been of some strength. It is now being deserted in favour of the more healthy suburb known as the petta, which is farther from the river and raised above the irrigated land, and consequently less malarious. The only industry is the weaving of silk fabrics. It is doubtful whether even this is what it was a dozen years ago. The weavers are unprogressive, and most of them have fallen into the hands of the local capitalists, who advance materials and take the stuffs they weave, paying them only for their labour. The town is surrounded by irrigated land watered from channels from the Tungabhadra, and a good deal of coarse sugar is still made; but this does not command its former price, having been largely ousted by the superior article refined by European processes.\n\nKamptee (K\u0101mth\u012b).\u2014Town with cantonment in N\u0101gpur District, Central Provinces, situated in 21\u00b0 13' N. and 79\u00b0 12' E., on the Bengal-N\u0101gpur Railway, 10 miles from N\u0101gpur city and 529 from Bombay. It stands on the right bank of the Kanh\u0101n river, and the cantonment extends in a long narrow line beside the river, with the native town to the south-east. The population at the four enumerations was as follows: (1872) 48,831; (1881) 50,987; (1891) 53,159; (1901) 38,888. The population in 1901 included 26,379 Hindus, 9,852 Muhammadans, and 1,851 Christians, of whom 1,036 were Europeans and Eurasians. Kamptee is the fourth town in the Province in respect of population. The ordinary garrison consists of a battalion of British infantry, one of Native infantry, and a field battery. Kamptee was until recently the head-quarters of the general commanding the N\u0101gpur district; but this appointment has now been abolished, and the garrison is at present commanded from Ahmadnagar. The cantonment was established in 1821, and was made the head-quarters of the Subsidiary force maintained by the British under treaty with the N\u0101gpur Raja. The whole town is included in the cantonment. The receipts and expenditure of the cantonment fund during the last decade averaged 1.1 lakhs. In 1903-4 the receipts were Rs. 1,06,000 and the charges Rs. 1,18,000. During Mar\u0101th\u0101 rule traders flocked to Kamptee on account of the comparative immunity from taxation which they enjoyed within the cantonment, and a large commercial town thus grew up alongside it. Owing to its favourable situation on the roads leading to N\u0101gpur from the S\u0101tpur\u0101 plateau, Kamptee for a long period monopolized the trade from this area; and it is only within comparatively recent years that the advantages possessed by N\u0101gpur, as the larger town and capital of the Province, have enabled it gradually to attract to itself the commercial business of Kamptee. To this transfer of trade are to be attributed the stationary or declining figures\nof population during the last thirty years, and the construction of the Satpura railway may tend to accelerate the process. The town contains three cotton-ginning and two pressing factories with a total capital of 2.4 lakhs, three of which were opened in 1891 and 1892 and the others since 1900. Muhammadan hand-weavers produce the cheaper kinds of cloth. Weekly cattle and timber markets are held, and the town contains one printing press. The Cantonment Magistrate, who has also the powers of a Small Cause Court Judge, has jurisdiction over the cantonment. The educational institutions comprise a Government high school, one English middle, two vernacular middle, and eleven primary schools. The Convent of St. Joseph maintains a boarding and day school for European children, teaching in some cases up to the matriculation standard, orphanages for native children, and a dispensary. Medical relief is afforded to the civil population at the Cantonment General Hospital and a branch dispensary in the town.\n\nK\u0101mr\u016bp.\u2014District of Eastern Bengal and Assam, lying between 25\u00b0 43' and 26\u00b0 53' N. and 90\u00b0 39' and 92\u00b0 11' E., with an area of 3,858 square miles. It is bounded on the north by Bhutan; on the east by Darrang and Nowgong; on the south by the Kh\u0101si Hills; and on the west by Go\u0101lp\u0101ra. The Brahmaputra flows through the District, and divides it into two unequal portions, about two-thirds of the total area being on the right or northern bank. South of the Brahmaputra the country is much broken by the outlying spurs of the Kh\u0101si Hills which project into the valley, and low ranges of hills appear even on the north bank of the river. The scenery is thus pleasingly diversified, and the Gauh\u0101ti reach, enclosed in a circle of forest-clad hills, is extremely beautiful. The centre of the District is a broad plain, the greater part of which is covered with rice-fields, with dotted groves of bamboos concealing the villages of the Assamese; but farther north the land becomes too high for rice cultivation, and grassy uplands stretch to the foot of the outlying ranges of hills. The principal tributaries of the Brahmaputra are: on the north bank, the Barnad\u012b, which once formed the boundary between Darrang and K\u0101mr\u016bp; the Barali\u0101; the Chaulkho\u0101, which empties itself into the Man\u0101s; and the Man\u0101s, a large river which formerly marked the boundary of Go\u0101lp\u0101ra District. These rivers take their rise in the Him\u0101layas, and the swiftness of their current frequently causes them to cut away their banks and change their courses. At the foot of the northern hills there is a tract of gravel and sand, in which many of the minor streams vanish, to appear again some distance farther off. On the south bank the only rivers of any importance are the Digru, the Kulsi, and the Singr\u0101. All over the District are found numerous swamps, or li\u0101s, in many\nof which the water lies even during the dry season. The most extensive are the Dip\u0101r bil, about 8 miles west of Gauh\u0101ti, the Bild\u0101r\u0101 bil in the Pal\u0101sb\u0101ri tahsil, and the Asuchi bil in the H\u0101jo tahsil.\n\nThe plain is of alluvial formation, composed of sand and clay in varying proportions. South of the Brahmaputra low ranges of gneissic rock project from the Kh\u0101si Hills, and outliers are found on the north bank of the river.\n\nThe base of the southern hills is forest-clad; but to the north the country is covered with short grass, and is destitute of trees. High reeds and jungle grass spring up in great luxuriance on all low-lying land, and the forest is rendered beautiful by great ferns and the graceful foliage of the creeping cane.\n\nElephants and bison are still found in the low hills, and rhinoceros and buffalo in the marshes; tigers, leopards, bears, hog, and several species of deer are not uncommon. In 1904, 12 men and 2,709 animals were killed by wild beasts, though rewards were paid for the destruction of 201 tigers and leopards. The principal kinds of small game are hares, partridges, wild duck and geese, florican, and snipe.\n\nThe climate of the District does not differ materially from that of the rest of the Assam Valley; between November and the middle of March it is cold and pleasant, but during the rest of the year warm and damp. The tarai at the foot of the Kh\u0101si Hills is particularly unhealthy. The prevailing direction of the wind is from the northeast, and during the cold season fogs gather daily in the early morning over the valley of the Brahmaputra.\n\nThe annual rainfall at Gauh\u0101ti averages only 67 inches, but near the hills 80 or 85 inches are received. The rainfall, though invariably abundant, is sometimes unfavourably distributed, and the rice crop suffers from the premature cessation of the monsoon. The greatest natural calamity from which the District has suffered was the earthquake of June 12, 1897. The Government offices and nearly all masonry buildings in Gauh\u0101ti were wrecked, and roads and bridges were destroyed. The drainage of the District was obstructed, the levels appear to have been altered, and large tracts of fertile land were rendered unfit for cultivation. After the earthquake the floods of the Brahmaputra were of exceptional severity, and agriculture received a serious check.\n\nThe District originally formed part of the ancient Hindu kingdom of K\u0101mar\u016bpa, which, according to the Jogini Tantra, included the whole of the Brahmaputra Valley, with Rangpur and Cooch Beh\u0101r. One of the earliest kings, Bhagadatta, whose capital was situated at Pr\u0101gjyotishapura, the modern Gauh\u0101ti, is said to have fought on the losing side in the great war\nof the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata; but the history of the country up to a recent date is involved in great obscurity. In the sixteenth century K\u0101mr\u016bp formed part of the territory of the Koch dynasty. The king, Nar N\u0101r\u0101yan, waged successful war against the Ahoms and the R\u0101j\u0101s of Cach\u0101r, Jainti\u0101, Sylhet, and Tippera; but the kingdom was divided, and the territory east of the Sankosh, which includes the present K\u0101mr\u016bp, was allotted to Nar N\u0101r\u0101yan\u2019s nephew, Raghu Rai, while his son Lakshmi N\u0101r\u0101yan retained as much of the kingdom as lay west of that river. Disputes soon broke out between the two branches of the family, and the Muhammadans were called in on one side, the Ahoms on the other. The struggle between these powers continued for some years, but the Muhammadans at last succeeded in inflicting a decisive defeat upon their opponents, and occupied Gauh\u0101ti in 1637. This was not, however, the first occasion on which the Muhammadans had invaded Assam. At the beginning of the thirteenth century expeditions had been dispatched up the valley of the Brahmaputra; but the raiders, though for a time successful, were unable to retain their hold upon the country. Two of their leaders in the sixteenth century are still well remembered: Turbak, the remnants of whose army were finally converted into the degraded Muhammadan caste known as Mori\u0101s; and K\u0101l\u0101 P\u0101h\u0101r, who is said to have partially destroyed the sacred temples at K\u0101m\u0101khya and H\u0101jo. The last and greatest invasion was that of M\u012br Jumla in 1660\u20132. This general, though at first successful, was subsequently overcome by the difficulties of the climate and the country, and was compelled to retreat with the loss of all his guns. The Muhammadan frontier was then fixed at Go\u0101lp\u0101ra, and K\u0101mr\u016bp was absorbed into the Ahom kingdom, Gauh\u0101ti becoming first the head-quarters of the viceroy of Lower Assam, and at the end of the eighteenth century of the R\u0101j\u0101 himself. By this time the power of the Ahom king had been completely undermined, and Captain Welsh was sent into the valley in 1792 to put a stop to the anarchy then prevailing. He was recalled two years later; and Assam again became a scene of internecine struggles, which culminated in the occupation of the Burmese, who ravaged the Province with fire and sword. In 1826, after the first Burmese War, K\u0101mr\u016bp, with the rest of the valley of the Brahmaputra, was ceded to the British. The Du\u0101rs at the foot of the Him\u0101layas remained, however, in possession of the Bhoti\u0101s till 1841. In that year they were annexed and compensation paid to the hillmen for their loss of territory. On the outbreak of the Bhutan War in 1864, Dew\u0101ngiri was occupied by British troops, but they subsequently retired from the post with undue precipitation. The village was recaptured in April, 1865, and since that date has formed a part of British territory. The head-quarters of the Assam Division were originally fixed at Gauh\u0101ti; but in 1874, when Assam\nwas separated from Bengal, Shillong was chosen as the seat of government.\n\nGauh\u0101ti contains numerous tanks and temples, and is surrounded by extensive earthworks, which bear witness to the importance of the kingdom of which it formed the capital. The remains of a large number of Hindu temples are scattered over the District, the most important being those at K\u0101makhy\u0101 just below Gauh\u0101ti, and at H\u0101jo, about 15 miles by road north-west of that place.\n\nThe population of the District at the last four enumerations was: (1872) 561,681, (1881) 644,960, (1891) 634,249, and 1901 (589,187). The decrease in the last two decades is due to the ravages of a peculiarly malignant form of fever known as kal\u0101 az\u0101r, and to general unhealthiness; but it is believed that since 1899 the population has been again increasing. The District is divided into two subdivisions, Gauh\u0101ti and Barpet\u0101, with head-quarters at the towns of the same name, and contains 1,716 villages. The following table gives the area, number of towns and villages, and population, according to the Census of 1901:\n\n| Subdivision | Area in square miles | Number of Towns | Villages | Population | Population per square mile | Percentage of variation in population between 1891 and 1901 | Number of persons able to read and write |\n|-------------|---------------------|----------------|----------|------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Barpet\u0101     | 1,274               | 1              | 600      | 115,935    | 91                        | -14.5                                           | 4,520                                  |\n| Gauh\u0101ti     | 2,584               | 1              | 1,116    | 473,252    | 183                       | -5.0                                            | 16,228                                 |\n| District total | 3,858             | 2              | 1,716    | 589,187    | 153                       | -7.1                                            | 20,748                                 |\n\nHindus formed 69 per cent. of the population, and Muhammadans 9 per cent., while 21 per cent. were animistic tribesmen. How little the District has been affected by outside influences can be judged from the fact that 83 per cent. of the population in 1901 spoke Assamese and 11 per cent. Bodo or plains Kachari; while only 3 per cent. of the population enumerated there had been born outside its boundaries. Kamrup is further peculiar in that the women exceeded the men in numbers.\n\nThe principal Hindu caste is the Kalit\u0101 (115,600), a respectable caste supposed to be the descendants of Aryans who had immigrated to Assam before the functional division of caste was introduced into Bengal. The Koch, into whose ranks converted Kacharis are received, are also numerous (93,800), and so are the Kewats (41,600). The Shahas (14,100) are by tradition liquor-sellers, but have taken to agriculture, and have succeeded in obtaining a respectable position in Assamese society. The District contains many shrines, and Br\u0101h-\nmans (23,100) are found in much larger numbers than in the rest of the Assam Valley. The principal aboriginal tribes are the K\u0101ch\u0101ris (92,100), and the Rabh\u0101s, who are closely akin to them (16,300), the Mikirs (10,600), the G\u0101ros, and the Lalungs. All of these tribes are members of the great Bodo race, which is supposed to have entered the valley from North-Western China many centuries ago. Agriculture supports 81 per cent. of the population, a lower proportion than in the other plains Districts of the Province. The number of priests, fishermen, and beggars is, however, unusually high, the strength of the last-named class giving some indication of the misfortunes which K\u0101mr\u016bp has recently experienced. There is a branch of the American Baptist Mission at Gauh\u0101ti, and the great majority of the native Christians (1,379) in 1901 are members of the sect.\n\nBroadly speaking, the District on either side of the Brahmaputra is divided into three belts of land with different characteristics. The first is the chapari, or tract bordering on the river, which is subject to deep inundation during the rains, but dries rapidly at the approach of the cold season. The soil is usually a light loam, on which rank jungle springs up with great rapidity, but which yields, when cultivated, excellent crops of mustard and summer rice, though the latter is liable to be destroyed by an early rise of the river. Permanent villages are never found here, and the land is generally abandoned after it has been cultivated for two or three years. This riverain tract merges gradually into a broad plain, in which transplanted winter rice (s\u0101li) is the staple crop; in the intermediate stage, where the water lies too deep to admit of transplantation, bao, a long-stemmed variety of winter rice, is sown broadcast. Lastly, the high land under the hills is well drained and free from risk either of flood or drought, as it can be irrigated from the hill streams. Here the staple crop is s\u0101li; or transplanted \u0101hu (khurma), which is reaped in November and yields a much larger out-turn than the same rice when sown broadcast. The soil of the District varies from pure sand to a stiff clay which is useless for any kind of crop. The most fertile variety is a deep soft loam, which is found in the lowest part of the rice basins. The crops depend, however, more on the water-supply than upon the intrinsic fertility of the soil, and in the central and submontane tract the supply of water is generally adequate. The chief danger to which agriculture is exposed is from floods, which have been especially severe since the drainage channels silted up at the time of the earthquake of 1897. Steps have, however, been taken by both Government and the villagers to re-excavate these channels.\n\nThe main agricultural statistics of the District are shown in the table on the next page, in square miles.\n\nThe staple food-crop is rice, which in 1903-4 covered 718 square\nmiles, or 76 per cent. of the total cropped area. Rather more than half of the rice crop was sali, 31 per cent. was ahu, and 20 per cent. bao. Other important crops are mustard (95 square miles), pulse (35), and sugar-cane. Mustard and pulse are usually grown along the banks of the Brahmaputra, on land afterwards occupied by summer rice.\n\n| Subdivision | Area shown in revenue accounts | Forest area |\n|-------------|-------------------------------|-------------|\n|             | Settled. | Unsettled. | Cultivated. |             |\n| Barpet\u0101     | 199      | 1,975      | 159         | ...         |\n| Gauh\u0101ti     | 825      | 1,759      | 639         | 149         |\n| Total       | 1,024    | 2,834      | 798         | 149         |\n\nWhen Gauh\u0101ti was the head-quarters of the Commissioner of Assam, a considerable number of tea gardens were opened in the neighbourhood of the town. In many cases, however, the sites were badly chosen, and the tea was planted on steep and rocky hill-sides, where the rain washed all the fertility from the soil. The seed employed was inferior, the rainfall insufficient, and a large proportion of the gardens proved to be unable to compete with the more prosperous estates of Upper Assam. The result was that the area under tea fell from 6,302 acres in 1882 to 3,659 in 1904. In the latter year 19 gardens yielded 735,000 lb. of manufactured tea, and gave employment to 7 Europeans and 2,416 natives, most of whom had been brought from other parts of India.\n\nThe cultivation of jute on a commercial scale has recently been introduced, but the industry is still in its infancy; and, apart from this, nothing has been done to develop the staples of the District, or to break up the large area of unsettled waste land. On the contrary, the area settled at full rates decreased by 12 per cent. between 1891 and 1901, owing to the decline in population and the injury done by the earthquake. Since 1901 there has, however, been a satisfactory extension of cultivation. Agricultural loans were first made in 1902, and during the next three years about Rs. 49,000 was advanced.\n\nThe Assamese are utterly indifferent to all the laws of breeding and to the comfort of their animals, and the native cattle are in consequence poor undeveloped creatures. The indigenous buffaloes are, however, larger and stronger than those of Bengal. The ponies brought down from the hills by the Bhotias are sturdy little animals, and the Bhutan cattle also are a fine breed, but cannot be obtained in large numbers.\n\nThe only irrigation works in the District are the small channels dug by the K\u0101ch\u0101ri villagers in the submontane tracts, to bring the water of the hill streams to their fields. Some channels, though only a few feet wide, are several miles long, and are capable of irrigating 3,000 or\n4,000 acres. They are constructed by the combined labour of the villagers without any intervention on the part of Government. Embankments for flood protection and drainage channels are, however, more necessary than irrigation works.\n\nThere were 30 forest Reserves in K\u0101mr\u016bp in 1903-4, with a total area of 149 square miles. The principal Reserves are those at Pantan and Bardu\u0101r (59 square miles), which are situated on the banks of the Kulsi river about 30 miles west of Gauh\u0101ti; and many of the other forests are small patches, only one or two square miles in area. By far the most important timber tree in K\u0101mr\u016bp is s\u0101l (Shorea robusta); but tita s\u0101pa (Michelia Champaca), ajhar (Lagerstroemia Flos Reginae), sam (Artocarpus Chaplasha), and gunserai (Cinnamomum glanduliferum) are also found. The area of 'unclassed' forests was 2,294 square miles, and, though only a small portion is actually covered with timber, the out-turn from these forests is larger than from the Reserves. There is a small plantation of teak and rubber-trees on the Kulsi near the Bardu\u0101r forest.\n\nNo minerals are worked in K\u0101mr\u016bp, but deposits of lime are said to exist at the foot of the Bhut\u0101n hills.\n\nManufactures, apart from tea, are unimportant. In each house there is a rough loom, on which the women of the family weave silk and cotton cloths. The silk cloths, which are usually made from the thread of the eri worm (Attacus ricini), are often sold; the cotton cloth is reserved for home use. Gold filigree-work is made at Barpet\u0101; but, though there are a number of jewellers in the District, articles are made only to order. Brass and bell-metal utensils, iron hoes and choppers, and rough pottery are also manufactured, though not in large quantities. Canoes are hollowed out of the trunks of large trees, the people of Barpet\u0101 being specially proficient in the art. Mustard oil is prepared in the ordinary country mill; and at Gauh\u0101ti there are two steam-mills, where flour is ground, cotton ginned, and oil expressed.\n\nThe general trade of the District is almost entirely in the hands of M\u0101rw\u0101ris from R\u0101jput\u0101na; but there are a certain number of Muhammadan shopkeepers, and at Barpet\u0101 the Assamese, whose wits have been unusually sharpened by their contest with nature in that inhospitable spot, are as keen traders as the M\u0101rw\u0101ris themselves. The principal exports are mustard seed, tea, cotton, lac, timber, and silk cloths. The articles received in exchange are rice, cotton yarn and piece-goods, grain and pulse, kerosene and other oils, hardware, and salt. The chief centres of trade are Gauh\u0101ti, Barpet\u0101, Soalkuchi, Pal\u0101sb\u0101ri, Rangia, Nalb\u0101ri, Baram\u0101, and T\u0101mulpur, while there are permanent shops at all the tahsil head-quarters. Most of the internal trade is, however, transacted at the markets, of which a large\nnumber are held in different parts of the District. In the interior, as well as at Gauh\u0101ti, the principal shopkeepers are M\u0101rw\u0101ris, who sell piece-goods, salt, grain, and oil, and not infrequently opium, and buy silk cloths, rice, and mustard seed, for which they often make advances before the crop is cut. The bulk of the trade is with Bengal, and is carried by steamer, though when the rivers rise in the rains country boats penetrate into the interior. The only foreign trade is with Bhut\u0101n, whose subjects come down through the Dew\u0101ngiri, Subankh\u0101t\u0101, and Kakil\u0101b\u0101ri Du\u0101rs to fairs held at Darrang\u0101 and Subankh\u0101t\u0101, and starting from these centres travel about the country. The principal imports from Bhut\u0101n are rubber, ponies, and blankets; the exports are cotton and silk cloths.\n\nThe Assam-Bengal Railway runs for 33 miles through the District to the Nowgong boundary, connecting Gauh\u0101ti with Dibrugarh, and with Chittagong via the North Cach\u0101r hills. Through railway communication to Calcutta will be provided by a line now under construction, which will run from a point just opposite Gauh\u0101ti to Golakganj on the Dhubri extension of the Eastern Bengal State Railway. A daily service of passenger steamers and large cargo boats, owned by the India General Steam Navigation Company and the Rivers Steam Navigation Company, ply on the Brahmaputra, calling at Gauh\u0101ti, So\u0101lkuchi, Pal\u0101sb\u0101ri, and Khol\u0101b\u0101nda. During the rains country boats come from Bengal, and proceed up the various rivers into the interior. Two trunk roads pass through the District, along the north and south banks of the river. In 1903\u20134 there were 16 miles of metalled and 160 miles of unmetalled roads maintained from Provincial funds, and 371 miles of unmetalled roads under the local boards. Generally speaking, K\u0101mr\u016bp is well supplied with means of communication. A steam ferry crosses the Brahmaputra at Gauh\u0101ti.\n\nAs in other parts of Assam, famine is unknown in K\u0101mr\u016bp; but in 1901 the rice crop was the poorest that had been reaped for many years, and there was local scarcity which necessitated some assistance from Government.\n\nFor general administrative purposes, the District is divided into two subdivisions: Gauh\u0101ti, under the immediate charge of the Deputy-Commissioner; and Barpet\u0101, usually entrusted to a native magistrate. The sanctioned District staff includes five Assistant Magistrates, a Forest officer, and an Engineer who is also in charge of the Khasi and Jaintia Hills, and whose headquarters are at Shillong.\n\nThe Deputy-Commissioner has the powers of a Sub-Judge, and certain of the Assistant Magistrates exercise jurisdiction as Munsifs. Appeals, both civil and criminal, lie to the District and Sessions Judge of the Assam Valley, whose head-quarters are at Gauh\u0101ti, while the\nHigh Court at Calcutta is the chief appellate authority. The Assamese are a quiet and peaceful people, and there is not much serious crime.\n\nThe land revenue system does not differ materially from that in force in Assam proper, described in the article on Assam. The settlement is ryotw\u0101ri, being made direct with the actual cultivators of the soil, and is liable to periodical revision. The District contains a large area of waste land, much of which is fit for permanent cultivation; and the settled area in 1903\u20134 was only 27 per cent. of the total area, including rivers, swamps, and hills. Mustard and summer rice are seldom grown on the same land for more than three years in succession, and the villagers are allowed to resign their holdings and take up new plots of land on giving notice to the revenue authorities. In 1903\u20134, 31,000 acres were resigned and 47,000 acres of new land taken up. Fresh leases are issued every year for this shifting cultivation, and a large staff of mandals is maintained to measure new land, test applications for relinquishment, and keep the record up to date. K\u0101mr\u016bp, like the rest of Assam proper, was last settled in 1893, and the average assessment per settled acre assessed at full rates in 1903\u20134 was Rs. 2\u20137\u20132 (maximum Rs. 4\u20132\u20130, minimum Rs. 1\u201311\u20130). The District is now being resettled after a detailed examination, in which the different classes of land have been more carefully discriminated. In recent years the people have suffered severely from exceptional unhealthiness and from the earthquake of 1897, which altered the levels of the country, causing obstructions to drainage and deposits of sand. An abatement of Rs. 60,000 has been made in the land revenue of the tracts most seriously affected. A special feature of the District is the large number of estates held revenue free (lakhir\u0101j) or at half-rates (nisfkhir\u0101j). These cover respectively an area of 53 and 229 square miles, and represent grants made by the Ahom R\u0101j\u0101s, usually to priests or temples.\n\nThe following table shows collections of land revenue and total revenue in recent years, in thousands of rupees:\n\n|                | 1880\u20131. | 1890\u20131. | 1900\u20131. | 1903\u20134. |\n|----------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Land revenue   | 9,12    | 9,52    | 11,92   | 12,30   |\n| Total revenue  | 13,25*  | 14,90   | 17,38   | 18,56   |\n\n* Exclusive of forest receipts.\n\nOutside the municipalities of Gauh\u0101ti and Barpet\u0101, the local affairs of each subdivision are managed by a board, presided over by the Deputy-Commissioner and the Subdivisional Officer respectively. The expenditure of these boards in 1903\u20134 amounted to about Rs. 1,43,000, nearly two-fifths of which was devoted to public works.\n\nFor the purposes of the prevention and detection of crime, the District\nis divided into 17 investigating centres, and the civil police force consisted in 1904 of 46 officers and 282 men. There are no rural police, their duties being discharged by the village headmen. During the winter 2 officers and 31 men of the Garo Hills military police battalion are stationed in K\u0101mr\u016bp, to hold the two outposts of Subankh\u0101t\u0101 and Darrang\u0101. A District jail is maintained at Gauh\u0101ti, and a magistrate's lock-up at Barpet\u0101.\n\nAs regards education, K\u0101mr\u016bp is fairly representative of Assam. The number of pupils under instruction in 1880-1, 1890-1, 1900-1, and 1903-4 was 6,261, 10,437, 12,346, and 12,951 respectively. Education has made considerable progress during the past thirty years, and nearly three scholars were under instruction in 1903-4 for every one in 1874-5. At the Census of 1901, 3\u00b75 per cent. of the population (6\u00b78 males and 0\u00b72 females) were returned as literate. There were 285 primary, 15 secondary, and 5 special schools in 1903-4. The number of female scholars was 431. The enormous majority of the pupils under instruction are only in primary classes, and the number of girls who have advanced beyond that stage is extremely small. Of the male population of school-going age, 25 per cent. were in the primary stage of instruction, and of the female population of the same age less than one per cent. Among Muhammadans the percentage of the scholars of each sex to the male and female population of school-going age was 27 and 1 respectively. An Arts college is maintained by Government at Gauh\u0101ti. The total expenditure on education in 1903-4 was Rs. 1,17,000, of which Rs. 21,000 was derived from fees. About 29 per cent. of the direct expenditure was devoted to primary schools.\n\nThe District possesses 2 hospitals and 8 dispensaries, with accommodation for 33 in-patients. In 1904 the number of cases treated was 64,000, of whom 600 were in-patients, and 1,100 operations were performed. The expenditure was Rs. 16,000, the greater part of which was met from Local and municipal funds.\n\nIn 1903-4, 39 per 1,000 of the population were successfully vaccinated, which was considerably below the proportion for the Province as a whole. Vaccination is compulsory only in Gauh\u0101ti town.\n\n[Sir W. W. Hunter, *A Statistical Account of Assam*, vol. i (1879); E. A.

The chief is a K\u0101yasth by caste, the first grantee, Rao Gop\u0101l L\u0101l, having been the family vak\u012bl.\nof the Chaube family of K\u0101linjar. The grant was made in 1812, when the Chaube family received their shares. A sanad of adoption was granted in 1862. The present holder is Rao R\u0101m Prasad, who succeeded in 1892. The j\u0101gir consists of 3 villages. Of the total area, 899 acres are cultivated, 126 being irrigable. The revenue is Rs. 2,500 a year. The chief place is Rajaul\u0101, situated in 25\u00b0 11' N. and 80\u00b0 51' E., 8 miles south of Karwi station on the Jhansi-M\u0101nikpur section of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway. Population (1901), 211.\n\nK\u0101mthi.\u2014Town and cantonment in N\u0101gpur District, Central Provinces. See Kamptee.\n\nKamudi.\u2014Town in the Mudukulatt\u016br tahsil of the R\u0101mn\u0101d estate, Madura District, Madras, situated in 9\u00b0 24' N. and 78\u00b0 23' E. The population (1901) is 6,854, of whom 1,000 are Musalm\u0101ns. It contains a large Siva temple, which has been the subject of a famous law-suit, the Sh\u0101n\u0101ns, a caste of toddy-drawers and merchants, claiming the right to enter within its precincts and the majority of the rest of the Hindus opposing their claim. The town participated in the riots which were caused in 1899 by this and other pretensions of the Sh\u0101n\u0101ns, and a small force of punitive police is now quartered on it. Brass and bell-metal vessels are manufactured here.\n\nKanaigiri.\u2014T\u0101luk and town in Nellore District, Madras. See Kanigiri.\n\nKanara, North.\u2014District in the Southern Division of Bombay, lying between 13\u00b0 53' and 15\u00b0 32' N. and 74\u00b0 4' and 75\u00b0 5' E., with an area of 3,945 square miles. It is bounded on the north by Belgaum District; on the east by Dh\u0101rw\u0101r District and the State of Mysore; on the south by South Kanara in Madras; on the west for about 76 miles by the Arabian Sea; and on the north-west by the territory of Goa. The District is not to be confounded with the District of South Kanara in Madras. North Kanara is the most southerly of the coast Districts of the Bombay Presidency.\n\nThe Western Gh\u0101ts, varying in height from 2,500 to 3,000 feet, run through the District from north to south, dividing it into two parts: namely, the uplands or Bal\u0101gh\u0101t (area, 2,639 square miles), and the lowlands or Payan-gh\u0101t (area, 1,306 square miles). The coast-line is broken only by the K\u0101rw\u0101r headland in the north, and by the estuaries of four rivers and the mouths of many smaller streams, through which the salt water finds an entrance into numerous lagoons winding several miles inland. The shore, though generally sandy, is in some parts rocky. Fringing its margin, and behind the banks of the brushwood-bordered lagoons, rise groves of coco-nut palms; and inland from this line of palms stretches a narrow strip of level rice land. The whole\nbreadth of the lowlands, never more than 15 miles, is in some places not more than 5 miles. From this narrow belt rise a few smooth flat-topped hills, from 200 to 300 feet high; and at places it is crossed by lofty, rugged, densely-wooded spurs, which, starting from the main range of the Western Ghats, maintain almost to the coast a height of not less than 1,000 feet. Among these hills lie well-tilled valleys of garden and rice land. The plateau of the B\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t is irregular, varying from 1,500 to 2,000 feet in height. In some parts the country rises into well-wooded knolls, in others it is studded by small, isolated, steep hills. Except on the bank of streams and in the more open glades, the whole is one broad waste of woodland and forest. The open spaces are dotted over with hamlets or parcelled out into rice clearings.\n\nBoth on the coast, where the green curtain of the forest forms a pleasing background to the long stretches of white sand, on which the rollers break beneath tall palms or dense patches of casuarina, and above the gh\u0101ts in the vistas of giant hills covered with evergreen jungle, the scenery is of rare beauty. Owing to the absence of railway communication the greater part of the District is seldom visited, except by officials or sportsmen; but the traveller who strays into these unfrequented paths will find surroundings that compare favourably in picturesqueness with any of nature's handiwork.\n\nStretching across the watershed of the Western Gh\u0101ts, North Kanara contains two sets of rivers\u2014one flowing west to the Arabian Sea, the other east towards the Bay of Bengal. Of the eastern streams, the Varad\u0101, a tributary of the Tungabhadra, alone calls for mention. Of those that flow westwards, four are of some importance\u2014the K\u0101linadi in the north, the Gang\u0101valli and Tadri in the centre, and the Shar\u0101vati in the south. The last of these, plunging over a cliff 825 feet in height, about 35 miles east of Hon\u0101var, forms the famous Gersoppa Falls. Along the coast the quality of the water is good, and the supply throughout the year abundant.\n\nThe prevailing rocks are granite and trap, the former largely predominating. At the base of the granite hills a laterite formation is common. Along the coast from K\u0101rw\u0101r to Hon\u0101var the surface rock is almost entirely hard laterite, a stone admirably adapted for building purposes.\n\nThe humid climate and the high and equable temperature of North Kanara account for the predominance of heavy forest and the moisture-loving types of tropical vegetation. Teak prevails in loose lighter-coloured soils. Bamboos of several valuable kinds grow over the whole of the District. The chief liquor-yielding tree is the coco-nut, which is luxuriant in K\u0101rw\u0101r, Kumta, Ankola, and Hon\u0101var. Liquor is also manufactured from the baini (Caryota urens), which grows\nprofusely in the Gh\u0101t forests. A detailed list of important trees, shrubs, and common herbs is given in Sir James Campbell's *Bombay Gazetteer*, vol xv, part i.\n\nKanara is almost the only part of the Bombay Presidency abounding in wild animals. Within the last thirty years elephants have been shot in the District, but they are now extinct. Tigers are numerous, though they have decreased considerably in recent years. Leopards are found in large numbers, and occasionally the black variety. In the western portion of the above-gh\u0101t division, bison are common. Black bear, s\u0101mbar, the ribbed-face and mouse deer are frequently met with; and at times the game are much harried by packs of wild dogs who pursue the deer relentlessly till they succumb from exhaustion. In the smaller forests ch\u012btal (*Cervus axis*) are not uncommon. The absence of legal restriction on the number of deer shot has, however, led to such a reduction in their numbers that rules are now being brought into force to save them from extinction. Twenty years ago a herd of eighty ch\u012btal was not unknown; it would be difficult nowadays to meet with eight together. Among game-birds are the peafowl, jungle-fowl, spur-fowl, partridge, snipe, quail, duck, widgeon, teal, the green and the imperial pigeon. Red squirrels are frequently seen. Snakes are numerous, including the hamadryad or king cobra, and the python.\n\nThe climate of different parts of Kanara varies greatly in salubrity. The coast portion, though moist, is healthy; but the forest tracts, especially the upland forests, are always malarious and at intervals are visited by especially fatal outbreaks. The most unhealthy time in the forests is the first two months of the rains and the four cold-season months. The valleys of the K\u0101lin\u0101di and of its feeders are tracts where fever has a specially bad name. In December, January, and February the uplands at night and early morning are often wrapped in mist. From May 20 the south-west wind freshens and blows all day, and throughout the hot season the greater portion of the District is rendered agreeable by the prevalence of cool breezes. The temperature falls to $59^\\circ$ in November and rises to $91^\\circ$ in May. In March and April severe thunderstorms serve to cool the atmosphere. The highest annual rainfall is in Bhatkal, 156 inches, while Mundgod records only 46. Of the two divisions of the District, the lowland or coast tract has a heavier rainfall than the upland. The annual rainfall at K\u0101rw\u0101r averages 119 inches.\n\nIn the low-lying lands near the coast heavy rainfall and a stormy sea sometimes cause floods which damage the crops. In 1831 and again in 1848, owing to the tempestuous weather, the Hon\u0101var coast lands were flooded with salt water and the crops destroyed.\n\nIn the third century B.C. Asoka sent missionaries to Banav\u0101si in\nKanara. From numerous inscriptions the country appears to have been controlled successively by the Kadambas of Banav\u0101si, the Rattas, the Western Ch\u0101lukyas, and the Y\u0101davas. It was for long a stronghold of the Jain religion. In the sixteenth century, when the Portuguese established themselves upon the coast, Kanara was subject to the Vijayanagar kings. It is said to have been extremely rich and prosperous, and for a long period firmly withstood the efforts of the Muhammadan Sult\u0101ns of the Deccan to extend their conquests to the south. Eventually, after the crushing defeat at T\u0101likot\u0101 (1565) and the sack of the capital city of Vijayanagar, the local chiefs of Kanara assumed independence. The Musalm\u0101ns then attacked the Portuguese settlements on the coast, but were unable to subdue them. The power of Bij\u0101pur, however, was generally established over Kanara, and continued until the Mar\u0101th\u0101s obtained an ascendancy about 1675; but with the advance of Aurangzeb the country passed under the Mughals after the fall of Bij\u0101pur in 1686, and the chiefs of Sonda and Bednur tendered their submission and tributes. Some time subsequent to 1700 the Mar\u0101th\u0101s again held Kanara. In 1763 Haidar Ali captured Bednur and obtained an immense booty. Sonda and the sea-coast were also subdued by him, and this brought Haidar into collision with the Mar\u0101th\u0101s; but he was able to maintain his conquests, and even to extend them as far north as the Kistna. War breaking out with the British, Tip\u016b lost Hon\u0101var in 1783. After the defeat and death of Tip\u016b at Seringapatam, Sonda was annexed by the British in 1799. It included the Kanara country above the gh\u0101ts, which had been so desolated by war and pillage that there was little to govern except trees and wild beasts. This, with the coast tract taken from Haidar, was attached to the Madras Presidency in 1799, and placed in charge of Munro. It continued to form part of Madras until 1861. In that year, owing to its relations with Bombay and to the fact that the forests supplied the Bombay dockyard with timber for ship-building, North Kanara was transferred to the Presidency of Bombay.\n\nThe chief buildings of interest in the District are the Jain temples of Banav\u0101si, Gersoppa, and Bhatkal. The temple at Banav\u0101si, which is attributed to the legendary Jakhan\u0101ch\u0101rya, is of considerable dimensions. It is ornamented with sculptured figures and designs, and has a short Dravidian spire. A loose slab in the courtyard bears an inscription of the second century A.D. At Nagarbastikere near the modern Gersoppa several Jain temples mark the site of the old town. They are much damaged by time, but the images representing the twenty-third and twenty-fourth T\u012brthankars are still intact. They are finely modelled in black basalt. At Bhatkal fourteen Jain bastis are\nstill preserved, dating from the reign of Channabhaira Dev\u012b in the fifteenth century. At the same place are three stone tombs of European merchants who were buried in the year 1637. The numerous Hindu temples at Gokarn are ascribed to the fifteenth century. That of Mah\u0101baleshwar is the most imposing. Many Kanarese inscriptions have been found at Bhatkal, Gersoppa, and Banav\u0101si. At Ulvi in Supa there are a few Lingayat caves and the well of the Lingayat saint Basava.\n\nThe Census of 1872 showed a total population of 398,498, and in the next nine years the population increased to 421,932. By 1891 it had further increased to 446,453. The Census of 1901 recorded a population of 454,490, or 115 persons per square mile, residing in 8 towns and 1,281 villages. The taluka distribution was:\n\n| Taluka          | Area in square miles | Number of Towns | Villages | Population | Population per square mile | Percentage of variation in population between 1891 and 1901 | Number of persons able to read and write |\n|-----------------|----------------------|-----------------|----------|------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Haliy\u0101l        |                      | 1                | 105      | 35,122     | 53                        | + 13                                                        | 1,498                                  |\n| Supa petha     | 1,057                |                 | 132      | 21,008     | 53                        | - 35                                                        | 959                                    |\n| K\u0101rw\u0101r         | 281                  |                 | 54       | 58,460     | 208                       | + 10                                                        | 6,254                                  |\n| Yell\u0101pur       |                      |                 | 119      | 22,814     | 52                        | - 2                                                         | 1,590                                  |\n| Mundgod petha  | 760                  |                 | 77       | 16,739     | 52                        | + 0.6                                                       | 845                                    |\n| Ankola         | 375                  |                 | 90       | 39,665     | 106                       | + 7                                                         | 2,357                                  |\n| Sirsi          | 490                  |                 | 244      | 53,232     | 109                       | - 1                                                         | 6,341                                  |\n| Kumta          | 224                  |                 | 111      | 66,040     | 295                       | + 5                                                         | 7,700                                  |\n| Sidd\u0101pur       | 332                  |                 | 197      | 41,342     | 125                       | - 3                                                         | 3,428                                  |\n| Hon\u0101var        |                      |                 | 93       | 62,402     | 235                       | + 5                                                         | 5,227                                  |\n| Bhatkal petha  | 426                  |                 | 59       | 37,666     | 235                       | + 10                                                        | 1,877                                  |\n| District total | 3,945                | 8               | 1,281    | 454,490    | 115                       | + 2                                                         | 38,076                                 |\n\nThe chief towns are the municipalities of K\u0101rw\u0101r, the head-quarters of the District, K\u016bm\u1e6da, Bhatkal, Hon\u0101var, and Sirsi. Owing to the large areas of forest the country above the gh\u0101ts is very sparsely populated, and in parts the population is decreasing. Much of the labour required to cultivate the upland tracts is therefore drawn from outside, the chief sources being Goa, S\u0101vantv\u0101di State, and the Coondapoor taluk of South Kanara. The language of the District is Kanarese, which is spoken by 57 per cent. of the total population. On the coast north of Gokarn and in the Supa petha, Konkan\u012b replaces Kanarese as the common tongue.\n\nAmong the Br\u0101hmans of Kanara (72,000) the most important are the Haviks (41,000), who are chiefly engaged in cultivation, being the owners of the areca-nut gardens of Sirsi and Sidd\u0101pur talukas. They are reputed to have come originally from Southern India, and to have intermarried with the local cultivating caste of Gaudas. The second\nBrahman caste of importance is the Gaud Saraswat (25,000), also known as Shenvi, with the two kindred sub-castes of Bardeskar and Kudaldeskar. The Gaud Saraswats, who are very fair, claim a northern origin, and certainly came from Goa in the early part of the sixteenth century. They commonly eat fish, on which account other Brahmins usually deny them the full status of their caste. Closely allied to the Gaud Saraswats, and probably in former times one caste with them, are the Saraswats (2,000), also known as Kushasthali or Shenvipaiki, many of whom have lately come from South Kanara. Between Saraswats and Gaud Saraswats there is chronic enmity. The establishments of the Government offices in the District are largely recruited from the former.\n\nApart from the Brahman castes, the special interest of the North Kanara population centres in the primitive classes, such as the Halvakki Vakkals (4,000), Gamvakkals (12,000), Halepaiks (52,000), Mukris (5,000), Kumarpaiks (9,000), and Harakantras (6,000), who have much in common with the population of Malabar and South Kanara, and but little affinity with the rest of the Bombay Presidency. Among these primitive people there exists to the present day an organization by b\u0101lis or exogamous divisions strongly suggestive of totems. Thus, in the caste of a b\u0101li named after the sambhar deer, the members may not harm the animal, and do not intermarry. Descent is traced through females. With the gradual Brahmanizing of these castes, such as the recent promotion of the Kumarpaiks to Kshattriya rank, it is to be expected that this organization by b\u0101lis may in time disappear. It has survived long enough, however, to throw valuable light on the nature and origin of the Maratha devaks in the Deccan. The Marathas in North Kanara number 48,000, and are all cultivators, apparently a relic of the former Maratha dominion. Locally they are collectively described as Arer or Aryans. It is to be noted that the Gangavali river is popularly considered the extreme southern limit of the Aryan race and languages in India. South of this river the dark complexion, coarse features, Dravidian speech, and primitive customs of the people seem to lend much support to the popular view. Muhammadans (29,000) are distributed as follows: Pathans, 3,000; Saiyids, 2,000; Shaikhs, 19,000. Besides the regular Muhammadan population (descendants of local converts to Islam), generally in poor circumstances, employed chiefly in agriculture and by Government as messengers and police, there are, in Kanara, two special bodies of foreign Muhammadan settlers. Of these, the more important and well-to-do are the Navayats or seamen, representatives of the colonies of Arab merchants, of whom a remnant still exists along the whole coast-line of the Bombay Presidency, from Gogha southwards. The other foreign Musalm\u0101n community is the Sidis, descendants of African slaves formerly owned by the Portuguese. Although they have intermarried\nfor several generations with the low-caste population of the District, the Sidis have not lost their original peculiarities. They still possess the woolly hair and black skin of the pure negro. Some of them have been converted to Christianity, and some have become absorbed in the lower Hindu castes. They are for the most part very poor, and, settled in remote forests, live on the produce of little patches of rude cultivation.\n\nThe Christians in the District, who are almost all Roman Catholics, belong to two classes, the first of which consists of a few families from Goa, of Portuguese extraction, though much mixed by intermarriage with the natives of the country; the second are descendants of local converts to Christianity. Christians of the higher class are clerks, the rest principally artisans and labourers. The total number of native Christians in 1901 was 16,126, of whom 15,116 were Roman Catholics. The chief centres of Roman Catholic Christians are Honavar, Kumta, and Karwar. During their time of power and friendship with the Vijayanagar kings (1510-70), the Portuguese were probably allowed to make converts. But, as far as the record of treaties remains, it was during the early part of the eighteenth century, after the Mughals had withdrawn and when the Sonda chief in the north and the Bednur chiefs in the south were their close allies, that the Portuguese were most successful in spreading Christianity along the Kanara coast. When in 1784 Tipu succeeded in driving the British out of Kanara, he determined, on both political and religious grounds, to convert the native Christians of Kanara to Islam. After taking a secret census he dispatched troops who arrested 60,000, or, according to other accounts, 30,000 out of the 80,000 Christians found. The churches were dismantled and every trace of the Christian religion disappeared. Except infirm women and children, the prisoners were marched under a strong military escort to Seringapatam, then the capital of Mysore. The men were circumcised, the unmarried girls carried away as concubines, and many of the married women were badly treated. The change of climate from the coast to the Mysore uplands, harsh treatment, and the unhealthiness of some of the places to which they were sent, so broke the health of the converts that within a year 10,000 are said to have perished. A few Protestants are found in the towns of Karwar and Honavar. The only mission in the District is the Basel German Mission, with its head-quarters at Honavar. It was established in 1845 and supports five schools.\n\nThe cultivated portions of the lowlands are either sandy plains lying along the shore and the banks of rivers, or narrow well-watered valleys, which are for the most part planted with rice, cocoanut groves, and areca-nut gardens. In the uplands the soil is generally a stiff clay, retentive of moisture. Owing to the\nwant of inhabitants, and also to the malarious climate, many fertile and well-irrigated valleys lie waste and covered with forest; and difficulty is experienced in finding a sufficiency of labour for the lands already under cultivation.\n\nThe District is entirely ryotw\u0101r\u012b. The chief statistics of cultivation in 1903\u20134 are shown below, in square miles:\n\n| Taluka | Total | Cultivated | Irrigated | Cultivable waste | Forest |\n|--------|-------|------------|-----------|-----------------|--------|\n| Haliy\u0101l | 1,056 | 107        | 5         | 22              | 914    |\n| K\u0101rw\u0101r  | 281   | 50         | 3         | 14              | 215    |\n| Yellapur | 760   | 71         | 2         | 111             | 503    |\n| Ankola  | 375   | 42         | 4         | 15              | 312    |\n| Sirsi   | 491   | 85         |           | 13              | 380    |\n| Kumta   | 224   | 55         | 4         | 16              | 148    |\n| Sidd\u0101pur | 332   | 46         |           | 6               | 264    |\n| Honavar | 420   | 72         | 12        | 22              | 325    |\n| **Total** | **3,945** | **528** | **30** | **219** | **3,121** |\n\n* These areas are based on the latest information.\n\nRice, of which there are many varieties, is the staple crop, the area in 1903\u20134 being 297 square miles. Jow\u0101r, chiefly grown in the Haliy\u0101l taluka, occupied one square mile. R\u0101gi, occupying 8 square miles, is grown in the hills for the food of the poorer classes. Pulses occupied 10 square miles, the chief being mug, kulith, and udid, mostly grown in the coast talukas. Sugar-cane and safflower are also grown to a considerable extent; and coco-nuts, areca-nuts, the lesser cardamoms (Elettaria Cardamomum), and pepper are produced in gardens in large quantities for home consumption and for export. The cultivation of coffee has been tried but proved unprofitable. Rice and garden lands are irrigated, the water being obtained from perennial streams. Near villages, especially on the coast, there are groves and avenues of Alexandrian laurel, which attains a large size. East Indian arrow-root grows wild and is also cultivated in some parts. The cocoanut palm is common along the coast, and is the chief liquor-yielding tree in the District. The palms, grown solely for their nuts, are calculated to yield, on good coast garden land, a net yearly profit of about Rs. 50 per acre. The areca-nut gardens, which are situated in the upland valleys, are surrounded by strong fences, within which are planted rows of coco-nut, jack, and mango trees. The p\u0101n or betel-leaf vine (Piper Betle) is extensively grown; also the areca palm. The upland gardens further contain pepper, cardamoms, ginger, plantains; and sometimes pummelo, orange, lime, and iron-wood trees (n\u0101g-zh\u0101mpa) are found in these higher tracts. Of vegetables, the bhendi is largely grown on the coast; and the egg-plant, the water-melon, and various pumpkin gourds and cucumbers are common.\nFormerly, in the more open parts of the forest, nomadic cultivation by brushwood burning (kumri) was carried on, principally by tribes of Mar\u0101\u1e6dh\u0101 extraction. The chief difficulty experienced in regard to cultivation in North Kanara since the practice of kumri was stopped is that known as the betta and soppu question. Betta is forest land assigned to the adjacent garden cultivation for the provision of soppu or leaf manure, which is indispensable in the cultivation of betel, pepper, and cardamoms. The improvident use of betta assignments, leading to the destruction of the forest on the land, results in a constant demand for further assignments, which cannot be continuously met unless the forest is to be entirely sacrificed to cultivation. Efforts are being made to come to a final settlement with each garden holder, by the allotment of an area of betta that is adequate for his requirements if treated with proper care. The salt marshes on the coast are offered for reclamation on very favourable terms. The cultivators have little recourse to advances under the Land Improvement and Agriculturists' Loans Acts. During the decade ending 1903-4 only 1.5 lakhs was advanced, of which Rs. 27,000 was lent in 1899-1900 and Rs. 67,000 during the last three years of the period.\n\nThe cattle are inferior everywhere, especially below the Gh\u0101ts. K\u0101rw\u0101r, K\u016bm\u1e6da, Ankola, and Hon\u0101var contain few domestic animals of local breed. In K\u0101rw\u0101r, K\u016bm\u1e6da, and Hon\u0101var the Goanese and other Christians rear pigs. Fowls are kept by all classes except Br\u0101hmans.\n\nOf the total area of cultivated land, 30 square miles or 6 per cent. were irrigated in 1903-4. Canals and wells supply about 2 square miles each, tanks 4 square miles, and other sources 22 square miles. The M\u0101vinkop tank supplies 579 acres in the Haliy\u0101l t\u0101luka. The other special irrigation works are insignificant. In 1903-4 there were 18,205 wells and 5,534 tanks used for irrigation. Rice and garden crops are watered by runnels brought from streams or rivers. Near the coast in the dry season, dams of earth, stones, and tree branches are thrown across streams and the lands near are watered, the dam being removed at the close of the dry season or left to be swept away by the floods. Some places are watered by canals from ponds. Where the level of the water is below the field, if not very deep, it is raised in a basket hung on ropes and swung through the water by two men. If water has to be raised from a greater depth, the lever and bucket lift is worked by either one or two men; and, if the depth is still greater, it is drawn by the leathern bag worked by a pair of bullocks. When brought to the surface, the water is generally carried to the crop along the hollowed trunk of a palm-tree. The cost of constructing wells varies from Rs. 200 in sandy soil to Rs. 700 in the loam.\n\nThe forests of North Kanara are very extensive. Of the total area,\n3,262 square miles are under forest, of which 548 square miles are 'protected.' The Forest department has charge of the whole area. The forests are divided into three sections: the table-land above the Gh\u0101ts, the main range, and the western spurs. The first of these contains splendid forests of teak, black-wood, and other trees 80 to 150 feet high, with fine clean stems 60 to 90 feet high and 5 to 12 feet in girth. The central belt has some of the finest forest of the District, including the magnificent teak tracts along the K\u0101lin\u0101di, Bedti, and Gang\u0101vali rivers. Bamboos of several valuable kinds grow over the whole of the District. The more important trees in the K\u0101nara forests are khair, hedu, siras, dhaura, k\u0101ju, moha, phanas, undi, sisu, abmus, j\u0101mbul, nandruk, bhirand, nan, mango, sandal-wood, tamarind, teak, and hirda.\n\nThe forest revenue in 1903\u20134 exceeded 9 lakhs, mainly derived from the value of the timber sold from the d\u00e9p\u00f4ts. The cultivators are allowed to gather dry wood for fuel and leaves for manure, and to cut bamboos and brushwood for their huts and cattle-sheds. They are also supplied, free of charge, with such timber as they require for their own use. In former years most of the produce of the Kanara forests went westwards to the sea-coast, finding its chief markets in Bombay and Gujar\u0101t. Of late years the sea trade has fallen off, and the bulk of the timber is now taken eastward to the open country in and beyond Dh\u0101rw\u0101r.\n\nIron ore is found in different places in the main range and spurs of the Western Gh\u0101ts, and in the island of Basavrajdrug about half a mile off the coast of Haldipur and about 2 miles from the town of Hon\u0101var. The building stone in general use below the Gh\u0101ts is iron-clay or laterite, and sometimes granite or granitic schist and clay-slate. Above the Gh\u0101ts it is nearly always granite. In the same tract lime is usually made from limestone pebbles dug out of the banks of streams. On the coast, lime is prepared by burning cockle and oyster shells, which are abundant in most of the creeks and rivers, especially in the K\u0101lin\u0101di.\n\nIn K\u016bmta and Banav\u0101si there are skilled carvers of sandal-wood. A few hundred persons are employed in cutch-boiling. In the Ankola t\u0101luka are 131 salt-works, of which 107 were working in 1903\u20134 and produced 39,000 maunds of salt. With these exceptions North Kanara has no industries worthy of notice.\n\nThe ports of Bhatkal and Hon\u0101var were known in the early centuries of the Christian era, and rose to importance in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries as centres of the trade in horses from the Persian Gulf. At the present day the chief ports are K\u0101rw\u0101r, K\u016bmta, Ankola,\n\n---\n\n1 This figure is taken from the Forest Administration Report for 1903\u20134.\nHonavar, and Bhatkal, with a total trade in 1903-4 of 61 lakhs: namely, imports 20 lakhs, and exports 41 lakhs. The principal articles of export are rice, timber, coco-nuts, and spices; imports are piece-goods, metals, sugar, and spirits. Cotton from Dhawar, formerly exported in large quantities from Kumta, now goes by rail direct to the port of shipment for Europe.\n\nThe Southern Mahratta Railway crosses the north-west angle of the District. North Kanara is traversed from north to south by two main roads, one above the Ghats and one along the coast, and by four main roads at right angles to them which climb the Ghats and link up the principal coast towns with Belgaum, Dhawar, and Mysore State. These roads run from Kadra to Belgaum via Supa, from Karwar to Dhawar via Yellapur, from Kumta to Dhawar via Sirsi, and from Honavar to Mysore territory via the Falls. In 1904 the District possessed 340 miles of metalled and 885 of unmetalled roads. All these, except 24 miles of metalled and 585 of unmetalled roads in charge of the local authorities, are maintained by the Public Works department. Avenues of trees are planted along 166 miles. There is steamer communication with Bombay during the fair season only, the steamers of the Bombay Steam Navigation Company calling at Karwar, Gokarn, Kumta, Honavar, and Bhatkal twice a week on their way to and from Mangalore.\n\nNorth Kanara, with an assured rainfall, is practically exempt from famine. Bad seasons have been known, but the records point to the fact that local scarcity has only occurred owing to\n\nFamine. an influx of immigrants from the Deccan and Ratnagiri, or to the depredations of dacoits causing hindrance to the arrival of supplies. The District suffered from these causes in 1806, when men were forced to feed on roots and rice husks, and about 3,000 persons are said to have died of want. In the famine of 1877 relief was necessary on a small scale.\n\nThe Collector is usually assisted by a member of the Indian Civil Service and a Deputy-Collector. The District comprises the eight talukas of Ankola, Honavar, Karwar, Kumta, Siddapur, Sirsi, Halivai, and Yellapur. The mahals or pethas are Supa attached to Halivai, Mundgod to Yellapur, and Bhatkal to Honavar taluka. There are three Forest officers.\n\nThere is a District and Sessions Judge at Karwar and four Subordinate Judges. The District Judge acts as a court of appeal from the Subordinate Judges, of whom one decides all original suits without limit in value. Three of the Subordinate Judges exercise the powers of a Small Cause Court. There are twenty-five officers to administer criminal justice in the District. Crime is not of a serious nature below the Ghats, save an occasional case of forgery; while\nabove the Gh\u0101ts the most common offences are murder and dacoity, usually committed by persons coming from Dh\u0101rw\u0101r District.\n\nThe ancient Hindu revenue system involved theoretically the levy of a sixth part of the gross produce of the land as the share of the State; but in practice much more than a sixth was taken under various pretexts, either in kind or commuted into money. Probably in late years as much as one-third was exacted; but when Haidar Ali and Tip\u016b held Kanara, the District was rack-rented to such a ruinous extent that population was diminished by a third, and only half the nominal revenue could be collected. When the District was taken over by the British, it was at first proposed to introduce a permanent settlement; but, in consideration of its desolate condition, large reductions of revenue were made as a temporary measure, and a permanent settlement postponed. Before many years the opinion was expressed that the Government demand was far too high and unequal in its incidence, and operated against the spread of cultivation; and after an unsuccessful attempt to fix the revenue upon an average of past receipts, a survey was begun in 1822. This was rather a rough inspection than an accurate survey, but it showed that the area under cultivation was larger than had been supposed. By fixing the assessments at about a third of the produce, the general rate of taxation was lowered; but the revenue was increased and paid without difficulty. Some progress was made with the survey on this principle, when it was discovered that, as the rate was the same on all lands, good or bad, the worst lands were being abandoned; and it was then decided to classify the lands according to their quality. In 1848 a minute was recorded by the Collector, demonstrating that it was not possible to assess the District satisfactorily without positive information as to the extent and capabilities of the land and the amount of Government as distinct from private lands, and pointing out that private owners were on all sides extending their boundaries at the expense of Government. Still it was considered that the expense of a survey could not be afforded, and nothing was done until the District was transferred from Madras to Bombay. On its transfer, a survey was introduced, the greatest difficulty being experienced in identifying boundaries of villages and fields. Between 1864 and 1867 a survey settlement was made in 199 villages above the Gh\u0101ts, the whole District being completed by 1891. As the settlement spread towards the coast, the landholders showed signs of opposition; for it was found that the old assessments were far short of even a moderate rent, and that the revenue would be doubled. They refused to pay the new rates, and appealed to the civil courts for redress, carrying their suits to the High Court, which finally upheld the right of Government to revise the assessments in Kanara, and since then opposition\nhas died out. The survey increased the land revenue by 13 per cent. in Hon\u0101var, by 36 per cent. in Ankola and K\u016bm\u1e6da, by 63 per cent. in Yell\u0101pur, and by 115 per cent. in K\u0101rw\u0101r. The revision survey of three t\u0101lukas was completed between 1895\u20131900, the assessment and area remaining unaffected. The total assessment on Government occupied land is now 10 lakhs. The average assessment per acre is: on \u2018dry\u2019 land 7 annas, on rice land Rs. 2\u20135, and on garden land Rs. 11\u201315.\n\nCollections on account of land revenue and revenue from all sources have been, in thousands of rupees:\n\n|                | 1880-1 | 1890-1 | 1900-1 | 1903-4 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Land revenue   | 7.60   | 2.96   | 10.18  | 13.58  |\n| Total revenue  | 13.60  | 16.07  | 16.67  | 24.63  |\n\nThere are six municipalities in the District\u2014K\u0101rw\u0101r, K\u016bm\u1e6da, Sirsi, Haliy\u0101\u1e37, Hon\u0101var, and Bhatkal\u2014besides two temporary municipalities at Gokarn and Ulvi. Outside the limits of these, local affairs are managed by the District board and eight t\u0101luka boards. The total income of these bodies in 1903\u20134 was Rs. 1,18,000, the principal source being the land cess. The expenditure was Rs. 1,38,000, including Rs. 58,000 expended on roads and buildings.\n\nThe District Superintendent of police is assisted by 2 inspectors. There are 14 police stations in the District; and the total strength of the police force is 646, including 12 chief constables, 138 head constables, and 496 constables. The District jail at K\u0101rw\u0101r has accommodation for 252 prisoners. In addition, there are 10 subsidiary jails and one lock-up in the District, with accommodation for 180 prisoners. The daily average number of prisoners in 1904 was 189, of whom one was a female.\n\nCompared with other Districts of the Presidency, Kanara stands fifth in point of literacy. In 1901, 8.4 per cent. of the population (15 males and 11 females) could read and write. Education has spread widely of late years. In 1865\u20136 there were only 16 schools, attended by 929 pupils. By 1880\u20131 the number of pupils had increased to 6,511, and by 1890\u20131 to 12,214. In 1903\u20134 there were 208 public and 26 private institutions, attended by 9,689 male and 2,062 female pupils. The public institutions include one high school, 10 middle, and 197 primary schools. Of these one is maintained by Government, 147 are managed by local boards, and 37 by municipalities, 19 are aided and 4 unaided. The total expenditure in 1903\u20134 was Rs. 82,500, of which Rs. 16,000 was derived from fees, and Rs. 17,000 from Local funds. Of the total, 66 per cent. was devoted to primary education.\nThere is a hospital at K\u0101rw\u0101r, and 12 dispensaries, including a railway medical institution, are situated in the District, with accommodation for 85 in-patients. In these institutions 50,500 patients were treated in 1904, of whom 749 were in-patients, and 941 operations were performed. The total expenditure was Rs. 22,800, of which Rs. 10,060 was met from municipal and Local funds.\n\nThe number of persons successfully vaccinated in 1903-4 was 11,850, representing a proportion of 26 per 1,000, which slightly exceeds the average for the Presidency.\n\n[Sir J. M. Campbell, *Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency*, vol. xv (1883); *Selections from the Records of the Bombay Government*, No. CLXIII (1883).]\n\n**Kanara, South.**\u2014The more northerly of the two Districts on the west coast of the Madras Presidency, lying between $12^\\circ 7'$ and $13^\\circ 59'$ N. and $74^\\circ 34'$ and $75^\\circ 45'$ E., with an area of 4,021 square miles.\n\nThe vernacular name Kannada ('the black country') really refers to the black soil of the Kanarese-speaking country in the Southern Deccan. Though a historical misnomer as applied to the western seaboard, it yet marks its long subjection to the Kanarese princes who held sway over the Western Gh\u0101ts. The District is bounded on the north by the Bombay Presidency; on the east by Mysore and Coorg; on the south by Coorg and Malabar; and on the west by the Arabian Sea. The scarp or watershed of the Western Gh\u0101ts forms a natural frontier on the east. Approaching in the extreme north within 6 miles of the sea, the main line of this range soon swerves abruptly eastward round the Koll\u016br valley. Through this passes a road leading to the Honn\u0101r Magane, a small tract above the Gh\u0101ts belonging to South Kanara, but separated from it by Mysore territory. South of the valley rises the prominent sugar-loaf peak of Kodach\u0101dri, 4,411 feet; and thence, a precipitous cliff-like barrier with an average elevation of over 2,000 feet, the Gh\u0101ts run south-east to the Kudremukh, the highest peak in the District, 6,215 feet above sea-level. From this point they sweep east and south round the Uppinangadi tiluk to join the broken ranges of the Coorg and Malabar hills on the southern boundary of the District. South of the Kudremukh their character entirely changes. To the north few passes or prominent heights break the clearly defined watershed. On the south, deep valleys pierce the main line, flanked by massive heights such as Bal\u0101l\u0101rayandurga (4,940 feet) and S\u016brahmanya hill (5,626), while a profusion of forest-clad spurs and parallel ranges makes the scenery as varied and picturesque as any in the Presidency. West of the Gh\u0101ts a broken laterite plateau slopes gradually towards the sea. The general aspect of the District has been well described as a flatness uniform\nbut infinitely diversified. Much of the level surface is bare and treeless, and strewn with denuded granite boulders; but numerous miniature hill ranges, well wooded save where stripped for firewood near the coast, and bold isolated crags rising abruptly from the plain, prevent monotony.\n\nLocal tradition states that South Kanara was part of the realm wrested by the mythic Parasu R\u0101ma from the sea, and modern geology seems to confirm the view that it is an ancient sea-bed. Water is at any rate the element to which the District owes its distinctive characteristics. The monsoons have furrowed innumerable valleys in the laterite downs, and fertilized them with rich soil washed down by the streams. Valley opens upon valley in picturesque and diversified similarity, all converging at last into the main valleys through which the larger rivers of the District run. Along the backwater which these rivers form at the coast are found large level stretches of fertile rice and garden land. From the sea, indeed, the coast-line presents an endless stretch of coco-nut palms, broken only by some river mouth or fort-crowned promontory where the main level of the plateau runs sheer into the sea.\n\nThe rivers of the District, though numerous, are of no great length. Raging torrents in the monsoon, owing to the enormous volume of water they have to carry off, in the hot season they shrink to shallow channels in the centres of their beds. Rapid in their early course, they expand at the coast into shallow tidal lagoons. In the extreme south a number of rivers rising in the Malabar and Coorg hills form a succession of backwaters giving water communication with Malabar. At K\u0101saragod the Chandragiri (Payaswani) flows into the sea past an old fort of the same name. The Netr\u0101vati, with its affluent the Kum\u0101radh\u0101ri, and the Gurp\u016br river, which have a common backwater and outlet at Mangalore, drain the greater part of the Mangalore and Uppinangadi t\u0101luk\u1e63. The Swarnan\u0101di and the Sit\u0101n\u0101di drain most of the Udipi t\u0101luk and have a common outlet at the port of Hang\u0101rkatta. A picturesque and important backwater studded with fertile islands is formed to the north of Coondapoor town by a number of rivers draining much of the Coondapoor t\u0101luk.\n\nThe geology of South Kanara has not yet been worked out. It is probable that in the main it consists of Archaean gneisses of the older sub-groups, possibly with representatives of the upper thinner-bedded more varied schists (Merc\u0101ra schists) and plutonic igneous rocks where the District touches Mysore and Coorg. Laterite and ordinary coastal alluvium are common in the low-lying parts.\n\nAs might be expected from the heavy rainfall (145 inches), the flora of the District is exceedingly varied. The forests are both evergreen and deciduous, and the more important timber trees are mentioned\nunder Forests below. Of fruit trees, the coco and areca palms and the jack and mango are the most important. There are, however, few good grafted mango-trees, except in Mangalore town. The palmyra palm is found everywhere, and the cashew-tree is very common, especially near the coast. The bamboo grows luxuriantly. Considerable stretches of sandy soil along the coast have been planted with the casuarina. The betel vine, yams of various kinds, and plantains are raised in gardens, and turmeric and chillies as occasional crops. Flowers of numberless kinds grow in profusion, and in the monsoon every hollow and wall sprouts with ferns and creepers.\n\nThe fauna is varied. Leopards are found wherever there is cover, and annually destroy large numbers of cattle. The tiger is less common. On the Gh\u00e2ts bison (gaur) and sambhar attract sportsmen, and the black bear is also found, while elephants are fairly numerous in the extensive forests of the Uppinangadi taluk. Deer and monkeys do considerable damage to cultivation near the Gh\u00e2ts. The jackal is ubiquitous. The handsome Malabar squirrel (Sciurus indicus) is common in the forests, and flying foxes have established several flourishing colonies. Among rarer animals are the flying squirrel, lemur, porcupine, and pangolin. Many species of snakes exist, and the python and the hamadryad (Ophiophagus elaps) grow to an immense size. Crocodiles and otters are found in the larger streams. There is good fishing in the rivers, mahseer being numerous; but dynamiting, poisoning, and netting by the natives have done much to spoil it.\n\nThe climate is characterized by excessive humidity, and is relaxing and debilitating to Europeans and people of sedentary habits. The annual temperature at Mangalore averages $81^\\circ$. The heat is greatest in the inland parts of the District during the months of March, April, and May. Malarial fever is rife during the hot season and the breaks in the monsoon wherever there is thick jungle. From November to March a chilly land wind blows at night which, though it keeps the temperature low, is unhealthy and reputed especially dangerous to horses.\n\nThe annual rainfall averages 145 inches. It is smallest on the coast line, ranging from 127 inches at Hosdrug in the south to 141 inches at Coondapoor in the north. The farther inland one goes the greater is the amount, K\u00e2rkala close to the Gh\u00e2ts having an average of 189 inches. In 1897 the enormous fall of 239 inches was recorded at this station. Of the total amount, more than 80 per cent. is received during the four months from June to September in the south-west monsoon. The rains may be said never to fail, and the District has only once known famine. Floods, however, are rare, as the rivers have usually cut themselves very deep channels.\nLittle is known of the early history of South Kanara. Inscriptions show that it was included in the kingdom of the Pallavas of K\u0101nchi, whose earliest capital appears to have been V\u0101\u1e6d\u0101pi or B\u0101d\u0101mi, in the Bij\u0101pur District of Bombay. Its next rulers seem to have been the early Kadamba kings of Banav\u0101si, the Banaousir of the Greek geographer Ptolemy (second century A.D.), in North Kanara District. About the sixth century they were overthrown by the early Ch\u0101lukyas, who had established themselves at B\u0101d\u0101mi, the old Pallava capital. In the middle of the eighth century these were expelled by the later Kadamba king May\u016bravarma, who is said to have introduced Br\u0101hmans for the first time into the District. His successors seem to have ruled the country as feudatories of the R\u0101shtrak\u016btas of M\u0101lkhed in the present Niz\u0101m\u2019s Dominions, and of the Western Ch\u0101lukyas of Kaly\u0101ni in the same State. About the twelfth century the District was overrun by the Hoysala Ball\u0101las of Dorasamudra, the modern Halebid in Mysore. But there were frequent contests between them and the Y\u0101davas of Deogiri, the modern Daulat\u0101b\u0101d in the Niz\u0101m\u2019s Dominions, until in the fourteenth century they were both overthrown by the Delhi Mu\u1e25ammadans, practically securing the independence of the local chiefs. In the first half of the fourteenth century the District passed under the Hindu kings of Vijayanagar. About this time Ibn Bat\u016bta, the Mu\u1e25ammadan traveller, passed through it, and has left an interesting, though somewhat exaggerated, description of what he saw. During the next century the Portuguese made their first settlements on the west coast, and Vasco da Gama himself landed in 1498 on one of the islands off Udupi. After the battle of T\u0101likot\u0101 in 1565, in which the last Vijayanagar king was defeated by the united Mu\u1e25ammadans of the Deccan, the local Jain chiefs achieved independence. But in the beginning of the next century almost all of them were subdued by the Ling\u0101yat ruler, Venkatappa Naik, of Ikkeri, now a village in the Shimoga District of Mysore. During the next century and a half the Ikkeri chieftains, who had meanwhile removed their capital to Bedn\u016br, the present Nagar in Mysore, continued masters of the country, though most of the old Jain and Br\u0101hman chiefs seem to have retained local independence.\n\nBritish connexion with the District begins about 1737, when the factors at Tellicherry, taking advantage of a hostile move by the Bedn\u016br Raj\u0101, obtained commercial advantages, including a monopoly of all pepper and cardamoms in certain tracts. Haidar Ali, the Mu\u1e25ammadan usurper of the Mysore throne, after his conquest of Bedn\u016br in 1763 took Mangalore and made it the base of his naval operations. The place was captured by the English in 1768, but, on Haidar\u2019s approach a few months later, was evacuated. On the out-\nbreak of war with Haidar again in 1780, General Mathews, Commander-in-Chief of Bombay, landed opposite Coondapoor and took it. On his subsequent march north to Bednur, he also took Hosangadi and the Haidargarh fort. Bednur itself next fell, but the arrival of a large relieving force under Tipu, Haidar's son, forced Mathews to capitulate. Tipu then besieged Mangalore, which surrendered after a protracted struggle. During this war, Tipu, suspecting that the native Christians of the District were secretly aiding the English, deported large numbers of them to Mysore and forcibly converted them to Islam. During the final war with Tipu, which ended in his death at the fall of Seringapatam in 1799, the District suffered severely from the depredations of the Coorgs. By the Partition Treaty of the same year it fell to the British. To the country thus acquired was added in 1834, on the annexation of Coorg, the portion of that province which had been ceded to the Coorg Raja in 1799. In 1862 the country north of the Coondapoor taluk was transferred to the Bombay Presidency, leaving the District as it now stands to the administration of Madras.\n\nThe chief objects of archaeological interest in South Kanara are its Jain remains, which are among the most remarkable in the Presidency. The most noteworthy are found at Karkala, Mudbidri, and Yenur, in a part of the District long ruled by Jain chiefs, of whom the most important were the Bhairarasa Wodeyars of Karkala. Under this family, which migrated from above the Ghats, building in stone is supposed to have been introduced into this part of the west coast. Fergusson states that the architecture of the Jain temples has no resemblance to the Dravidian or other South Indian styles, but finds its nearest affinity in Nepal and Tibet. There is no doubt that it is largely a reproduction of the architectural forms in wood used in the country from early times. The remains are of three kinds. The first are the bettas, or walled enclosures containing colossal statues. There is one of these statues at Karkala and another at Yenur. The former is the larger, being 41 feet 5 inches high, and is also the more striking, as it stands on the top of a rocky hill overlooking a picturesque lake. They both have the traditional forms and lineaments of Buddha, but are named after Gomata Raya, a forgotten and perhaps mythical Jain king. They are monolithic: and the method of their construction, whether they were hewn out of some boulder which stood on their sites, or whether they were sculptured elsewhere and removed to their present positions, is a mystery. A still larger statue, also said to be of Gomata Raya, at Sravana Belgola in Mysore is the only other example known. An inscription on the Karkala statue states that it was erected in A.D. 1431. The second class of Jain remains are the bastis or temples. These are found all over the District, the most famous group being\nat M\u00fcdbidri, where there are eighteen of them. With plain but dignified exteriors, clearly showing their adaptation from styles suited to work in wood, and greatly resembling the architecture common in Nep\u0101l in the reverse slope of the eaves above the veranda, nothing can exceed the richness and variety with which the interior is carved. The largest bast\u012b at M\u00fcdbidri is three-storeyed, resembling somewhat the pagodas of the Farther East, and contains about 1,000 pillars, those of the interior being all carved in the most varied and exuberant manner.\n\nThe last variety of Jain antiquities are the stambhas or pillars. Though not peculiar to Jain architecture, the most graceful examples are found in connexion with the temples of that faith. The finest is at Haleangadi near K\u0101rkala. It is 50 feet from base to capital, the shaft being monolithic and 33 feet in length, and the whole gracefully proportioned and beautifully adorned. B\u0101rk\u016br, once the Jain capital of the region destroyed by Ling\u0101yat fanatics in the seventeenth century, probably excelled the rest of the District in the number and beauty of its buildings; but these are now a mere heap of ruins.\n\nSerpent stones in groves and on platforms round the sacred fig-trees are numerous, bearing witness to the tree and serpent worship imposed by the influence of Jainism and Vaishnavism on the primitive demon and ancestor worship of the country. The Hindu temples are as a rule mean and unpretentious buildings, though many of them, such as that to Krishna at Udipi and the shrines at Subrahmanya, Kollur, Sankaran\u0101r\u0101yana, and Koteshwar, are of great antiquity and sanctity. Forts are numerous, especially along the sea-coast, but of little importance archaeologically. That at Bekal is the largest, and was formerly a stronghold of the Bedn\u016br kings.\n\nSouth Kanara is divided into the five t\u0101luks of Coondapoor, K\u0101s\u0101ragod, Mangalore, Udipi, and Uppinangadi, and includes also the Amindivi Islands in the Indian Ocean. The head-quarters of the t\u0101luks (except of Uppinangadi, which is at Putt\u016br) are at the places from which they are respectively named. The headman of the Amindivis lives on the Amini island. Statistics of these areas, according to the Census of 1901, are shown in the table on the next page.\n\nMuch of South Kanara is hill and forest; and the density of the population is accordingly little above the average for the Presidency as a whole, fertile and free from famine though the District is. In the Uppinangadi t\u0101luk, which lies close under the Gh\u0101ts, there are only 147 persons to the square mile. This is, however, on the main road to Mysore and Coorg, and the opportunities for trade thus afforded have caused the population here to increase faster than in the District as a whole.\n\nThe population of South Kanara in 1871 was 918,362; in 1881,\n959,514; in 1891, 1,056,081; and in 1901, 1,134,713. It will be seen that the growth, though steady, is not remarkable. In the decade ending 1901 the rate of increase was about equal to the average for the Presidency, and during the last thirty years it has amounted to 24 per cent. There is considerable temporary emigration of labourers every year to the coffee estates of Coorg and Mysore, the total loss to the District in 1901 on the movement between it and these two areas being 14,000 and 40,000 persons respectively. On the other hand, South Kanara obtains very few immigrants from elsewhere. In 1901 less than 2 persons in every 100 found within it had been born outside. As in the case of Malabar, this is largely due to its geographical isolation, and to the fact that the ways and customs of its people and its agricultural tenures differ much from those of neighbouring areas. The people are fonder of living in their own separate homesteads than in streets, and the District consequently has a smaller urban population than any other except Kurnool and the Nilgiris, and includes only two towns. These are the municipality of Mangalore (population, 44,168), the District head-quarters, and the town of Udupi (8,041). Both are growing places. There are few villages of the kind usual on the east coast, the people living in scattered habitations.\n\n| Taluk          | Area in square miles | Number of Towns | Villages | Population | Population per square mile | Percentage of variation in population between 1891 and 1901 | Persons able to read and write |\n|----------------|---------------------|-----------------|----------|------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| Coondapooi     | 619                 | 103             |          | 131,858    | 213                       | + 0.2                                                       | 7,748                          |\n| Udupi          | 719                 | 157             |          | 251,831    | 359                       | + 3.9                                                       | 15,406                         |\n| Mangalore      | 679                 | 243             |          | 334,294    | 492                       | + 10.5                                                      | 22,023                         |\n| Amindivi Islands | 3                  | 4               |          | 3,608      | 1,203                     | - 3.1                                                       | 38                             |\n| Uppinangadi    | 1,239               | 182             |          | 181,842    | 147                       | + 9.9                                                       | 7,818                          |\n| Kasaragod      | 762                 | 114             |          | 231,280    | 304                       | + 10.0                                                      | 13,067                         |\n| District total | 4,021               | 803             |          | 1,134,713  | 282                       | + 7.4                                                       | 66,190                         |\n\nOf the total population in 1901 Hindus numbered 914,163, or 81 per cent.; Musalmans, 126,853, or 11 per cent.; Christians, 84,103, or 7 per cent.; and Jains, 9,582, or 1 per cent. Musalmans are proportionately more numerous than in any Districts except Malabar, Madras City, and Kurnool; and most of them are Mappillas, who are described in the article on Malabar. Excluding the exceptional cases of Madras City and the Nilgiris, Christians form a higher percentage of the people than in any District except Tinnevelly. They have increased at the rate of 45 per cent. during the last twenty years. Jains are more numerous than in any other District of Madras.\n\nSouth Kanara is a polyglot District. Tulu, Malayalam, Kanarese, and Konkani are all largely spoken, being the vernaculars respectively\nof 44, 19, 19, and 13 per cent. of the population. Tulu is the language of the centre of the District, and is used more than any other tongue in the Mangalore, Udupi, and Uppinangadi taluks; but in Mangalore a fifth of the people speak Konkani, a dialect of Marathi, and in Udupi nearly a fourth speak Kanarese. In the Amindivi Islands and in Kasaragod, which latter adjoins Malabar, Malayalam is the prevailing vernacular. Most of those who are literate are literate in Kanarese. It is the official language of the District, and its rival, Tulu, has no written character, though it has occasionally been printed in Kanarese type.\n\nThe District contains proportionately more Brahmins than any other in Madras, the caste numbering 110,000, or 12 per cent. of the Hindu population. The Hindus are made up of many elements, and the castes are in need of more careful study than they have yet received. They include 16,000 Telugus (9,000 of whom are Devanga or Sale weavers); 82,000 members of Malayalam castes (most of whom are found in the Kasaragod taluk); 140,000 people of Marathi or Konkani-speaking communities; and 672,000 who talk Kanarese or Tulu. The three largest castes in the District are the Billavas (143,000), the Bants (118,000), and the Holeyas (118,000). The first two of these hardly occur elsewhere. They are respectively the toddy-drawers and the landholders of the community. The Holeyas are nearly all agricultural labourers by occupation.\n\nExcept the three Agencies in the north of the Presidency and South Arcot, South Kanara is more exclusively agricultural than any other District. As many as three-fourths of its people live by the land. Toddy-drawers are also proportionately more numerous than usual, though it must be remembered that many toddy-drawers by caste are agriculturists or field-labourers by occupation, while weavers and leather-workers form a smaller percentage of the people than is normally the case.\n\nOut of the 84,103 Christians in the District in 1901, 83,779 were natives, more than 76,000 being Roman Catholics. Tradition avers that St. Thomas the Apostle visited the west coast in the first century. The present Roman Catholic community dates from the conquest of Mangalore by the Portuguese in 1526. Refugees from the Goanese territory driven out by Maratha incursions, and settlers encouraged by the Bednur kings, swelled the results of local conversion, so that by Tipu's time the native Christian community was estimated at 80,000 souls. But after the siege of Mangalore in 1784 Tipu deported great numbers of them, estimated at from 30,000 to 60,000, to Seringapatam, seized their property, and destroyed their churches. Many of them perished on the road and others were forcibly converted. On the fall of Seringapatam the survivors returned, and the community\nwas soon again in a prosperous condition. The jurisdiction of Goa continued until 1837, when part of the community placed themselves under the Carmelite Vicar Apostolic of Verapoli in Travancore. After further vicissitudes the Jesuits took the place of the Carmelites in 1878. Mangalore is now the seat of a Roman Catholic bishopric.\n\nThe only Protestant mission is the German Evangelical Mission of Basel, established at Mangalore in 1834. Its converts now number 5,913, mainly drawn from the poorest classes of the people, who find employment in the various industrial enterprises of the mission.\n\nThe agricultural methods of South Kanara are conditioned by its climate and geological peculiarities. As already mentioned, the District is a laterite plateau on a granite bed, bounded by the Gh\u0101ts, and worn and furrowed into countless valleys by the action of the monsoons. Much of the level plateau above the valleys produces nothing but thatching-grass or stunted scrub; but the numerous hollows are the scene of rich and varied cultivation, and the slopes above the fields are well wooded save where denuded to supply the fuel markets of Mangalore and other large towns.\n\nThe soil is as a rule a laterite loam, which is especially rich in the lower stretches of the valleys, where the best rice land is found. Large stretches of level ground occur along the coast, where the soil is generally of a sandy character but contains much fertilizing alluvial matter. To the north of the Chandragiri river this land grows excellent rice crops and bears a very heavy rent. South of that stream the soil is thinner and suited only to the commoner kinds of rice; but tobacco and vegetables are grown in considerable quantities, especially by the M\u0101ppillas.\n\nEvery valley has one or more water channels running through its centre or down either side. The best rice-fields lie as a rule on a level with these channels, which feed them during the whole of the first-crop season by small openings in their embankments that can be shut or opened as needed. After the first crop of rice has been harvested, dams are thrown across these channels at intervals; and by this means the level of the water is maintained, and a second, and even a third, crop of rice can be grown by direct flow from the channel, water being let into the plots as required. Very often a permanent dam is maintained above the cultivation, to divert part of the water down the side channels. In the land immediately above these side channels a second crop of rice is grown by bailing either with picottahs, or, when the level admits, with hand-scoops (kaidambe) suspended from a cross-bar, or with a basket swung with ropes by two men. These lands are locally termed majal. Still higher up the slopes of the valley are other rice-fields, known as bettu, cut laboriously in terraces out of the hill-sides. These give only one crop of rice and, except where fed by some small jungle\nstream, are entirely dependent on the rainfall; consequently their cultivation is somewhat precarious. The areca gardens are mostly situated in the sheltered nooks of the valleys in the more hilly parts of the District and in the recesses of the lower spurs and offshoots of the Gh\u00e2ts, where the two essentials of shade and a perennial water-supply occur in combination. The finest coco-nut gardens are found in the sandy level stretches adjoining the coast, especially along the fringes of the numerous backwaters.\n\nA considerable quantity of black gram, horse-gram, and green gram is grown on the level land near the coast as a second crop, and on majal lands elsewhere if sufficient moisture is available. Sugar-cane is grown here and there beside the backwaters. Pepper has never recovered from the measures taken by Tip\u00fb to suppress its cultivation. In the south of the K\u00e2saragod taluk, kumri, or shifting cultivation, is still carried on in the jungles.\n\nThe District is essentially ryotw\u00e2ri, such in\u00e2ms as exist being merely assignments of land revenue. Statistics of the various taluks for 1903\u20134 are appended, areas being in square miles:\n\n| Taluk       | Area shown in accounts | Forests | Cultivable waste | Cultivated |\n|-------------|------------------------|---------|------------------|------------|\n| Coondapoor  | 619                    | 241     | 35               | 122        |\n| Udipi       | 719                    | 159     | 60               | 134        |\n| Mangalore   | 679                    | 60      | 122              | 195        |\n| Uppinangadi | 1,239                  | 547     | 91               | 162        |\n| K\u00e2saragod   | 762                    | 63      | 61               | 377        |\n| **Total**   | **4,018**              | **1,070**| **369**          | **990**    |\n\nMore than a fourth of the District consists of forest, nearly one-half is hilly and rocky land not available for cultivation, and the area actually cropped is less than a fifth of the total. Rice is by far the most important staple, the area under it (counting twice over that cropped twice) being 760 square miles. The garden area, 82 square miles, consists almost entirely of coco-nut and areca-nut plantations. These three crops practically monopolize the cultivation.\n\nFor agricultural purposes the ryots divide the year into three seasons, to correspond with the times of the three rice crops. These are K\u00e2rtika or Yenel (May\u2013October), Suggi (October\u2013January), and Kolake (January\u2013April). It is doubtful if any District in the Presidency shows such a round of orderly and careful cultivation, and the increased out-turn from any theoretical improvements that might be made would probably be more than counterbalanced by the enhanced cost of cultivation. The choice and rotation of crops, the properties of various soils, the selection of seed and of seed-beds, the number of ploughings, the amount of manure, the distribution of water, the\nregulation of all these, and the countless other details of high farming, if based on no book knowledge, have been minutely adapted by centuries of experience and tradition to every variety of holding.\n\nIn the jungles which almost everywhere adjoin the cultivation the ryot finds an unfailing supply of manure for his fields, of timber for his agricultural implements, which he fashions at little expense to himself, and of fuel for domestic use. Consequently he has availed himself but little of the Land Improvements Loans Act. Under the name of kumaki, holders of kadim wargs, or holdings formed before 1866, enjoy these privileges to the exclusion of others within 100 yards of the cultivation. No figures are available to show the extension of tillage. The absence of a survey, the connivance of the village and subordinate revenue officials, and the nature of the country have made encroachments particularly easy; and land has been formally applied for only where the prior right to it has been disputed, or to serve as a nucleus for future encroachment. Cultivation has increased steadily everywhere except immediately under the Gh\u00e2ts, where the miseries and depopulation caused by the disturbances of the eighteenth century threw out of cultivation large tracts which have never recovered, owing to the prevalence of malaria and the demand for labour elsewhere.\n\nThe chief drawback to agriculture in South Kanara is the want of a good indigenous breed of cattle. All the best draught and plough cattle have to be imported from Mysore, and even where well tended they are apt to deteriorate. The ordinary village cattle, owing to exposure to the heavy rains, indiscriminate breeding, bad housing, and a r\u00e9gime of six months' plenty and six months' want, are miserably undersized and weakly. The climate is equally unfavourable to sheep and horses, the number of which is small and kept up only by importation. A fair is held annually at Subrahmanya, to which about 50,000 head of cattle are brought from Mysore to meet local requirements.\n\nThe heavy rainfall and the rapid nature of the rivers do not admit of large irrigation reservoirs or permanent dams being formed, and as a result there are no Government irrigation works in the District. But the ryots have themselves most skilfully utilized the springs and streams by countless channels, feeders, and temporary dams. Along the coast, cultivation is largely assisted by shallow ponds scooped at little expense out of the sandy soil, and farther inland reservoirs of a more substantial nature are sometimes constructed at the valley heads. Many areca gardens are so supplied.\n\nSouth Kanara is essentially a forest District. With the exception of the bare laterite plateaux and downs of the K\u00e2saragod and Mangalore t\u00e2luks, and the spots where the hills near the coast have been stripped of their growth for timber, fuel, and manure, the country is everywhere richly wooded. The whole\nline of the Gh\u00e2ts with their spurs and offshoots presents an almost unbroken stretch of virgin forest, which finds its richest and most luxuriant development in the recesses of the Uppinangadi t\u00e2luk, where the most important and largest Reserves are found. The total forest area in the District is 662 square miles, and 408 square miles of 'reserved' land are also controlled by the Forest department. In the early years of British administration the claims of Government to the forests and their prospective importance were alike overlooked; but the rights of the Crown began to be asserted from the year 1839 onwards, and during the last thirty years Reserves have been selected and a system of conservation introduced.\n\nThe destructive system of shifting cultivation, locally known as kumri, has been prohibited since 1860, except in a few small tracts where it is strictly regulated. Such regulation is a matter of the greatest importance to a District with an annual rainfall averaging over 140 inches, the seasonable distribution of which depends largely on the proper protection of its catchment area.\n\nThe most valuable timber trees are teak, poonspar (Calophyllum elatum), black-wood (Dalbergia latifolia), jack (Artocarpus integrifolia) and wild jack (A. hirsuta), ventek (Lagerstroemia microcarpa), kir\u00e2lbhog (Hopea parviflora), banapu (Terminalia tomentosa), and marva (T. pani-culata). But development must still be said to be in its infancy. In fact, the chief revenue is at present derived from items of minor produce, such as catechu, grazing fees, &c. The main obstacle is the want of good communications; but once this is overcome, whether by a system of light railways or otherwise, the South Kanara forests should be of the greatest value.\n\nA fine clay excellently adapted for pottery is found in several localities, especially along the banks of the Netr\u00e2vati, which supplies material for the Mangalore tile-works mentioned below. Gold and garnets are known to occur in one or two places, but the mineral resources of the District are as yet practically unexplored. The ordinary laterite rock, which is easily cut and hardens on exposure, forms the common building material.\n\nThe only large manufactures in South Kanara are the results of European enterprise. Tile-making was introduced by the Basel Mission, and this body has now two factories at Mangalore and another at Malpe near Udupi. At Mangalore one other European firm and nine native merchants are engaged in the industry, and elsewhere in the District are two more native factories. The industry employs altogether about 1,000 hands. The Basel Mission has also a large weaving establishment at Mangalore, and some of its employ\u00e9s have started small concerns elsewhere; but otherwise the weaving of the\nDistrict is of the ordinary kind. The same may be said with reference to the work of the goldsmiths, blacksmiths, and other artisans. Four European and three native firms are engaged in coffee-curing. In 1903-4 coffee from above the Gh\u00e2ts to the value of 41 lakhs was exported. Coir yarn is manufactured in considerable quantities in the Aminidivi Islands, where it forms a Government monopoly, and along the coast. On the coast, too, a considerable industry exists in fish-curing, which is done with duty-free salt in fourteen Government curing-yards. Most of the product is exported to Colombo, but large quantities are also sent inland. Sandal oil is distilled in the Udupi taluk from sandal-wood brought down from Mysore.\n\nThe principal articles of export are coffee, tiles, coco-nut kernels (copra), rice, salted fish, spices, and wood. The tiles are exported to Bombay and to ports in the Presidency. The coffee is brought from Mysore and Coorg to be cured, and is exported chiefly to the United Kingdom and France. The coco-nut kernels go chiefly to Bombay, rice to Malabar and Goa, and salted fish to Colombo. Large quantities of areca-nuts are shipped to Bombay and K\u00e2thi\u00e2w\u00e2r. The wood exported is chiefly sandal brought from Mysore and Coorg. The chief imports are cotton piece goods, grain, liquor, oil, copra, pulses, spices, sugar, salt, and salted fish, largely to meet local needs, but partly for re-export to Mysore and Coorg. The bulk of the trade is carried on at Mangalore (the commerce of which is referred to in the separate article upon the place): and Malpe, Hang\u00e2rkatta, and Gangoli are the most important of the outports. The most prominent by far of the mercantile castes are the M\u00e2ppillas, who are followed by Telugu traders, such as the Balij\u00e2s and the Chettis. Konkani Br\u00e2hmans, native Christians, and Raj\u00e2puris also take a share. There are twenty weekly markets in the District under the control of the local boards.\n\nThe District had recently no railways; but the Azhikal-Mangalore extension of the Madras Railway, opened throughout in 1907, now affords communication with Malabar and the rest of the Presidency. Its construction is estimated to have cost 109 lakhs for a length of 78 miles. A line from Arsikere on the Southern Mahratta Railway to Mangalore has also been projected and surveyed.\n\nThe total length of metalled roads is 148 miles and of unmetalled roads 833 miles, all of which are maintained from Local funds. Avenues of trees have been planted along 467 miles. The main lines are the coast road from Kavoy to Shir\u00fbr; the roads leading to Merc\u00e2r through the Sampaji gh\u00e2t from K\u00e2saragod and Mangalore; and those from Mangalore through the Ch\u00e2rn\u00e2di gh\u00e2t to Mudugere taluk, and through K\u00e2rkala and the Agumbe gh\u00e2t to the Koppa taluk in Mysore. Lines running through the Koll\u00fbr, Hosangadi, Shir\u00e2di, and Bisale\ngh\u0101ts also afford access to Mysore, and the main routes are fed by numerous cross-roads. The tidal reaches of the rivers and the numerous backwaters furnish a cheap means of internal communication along the coast. In the monsoon communication by sea is entirely closed; but during the fair season, from the middle of September to the middle of May, steamers of the Bombay Steam Navigation Company call twice weekly at Mangalore and other ports in the District. Mangalore is also a port of call for steamers of the British India Company and other lines. Large numbers of coasting craft carry on a brisk trade.\n\nOwing to the abundant monsoons the District always produces more grain than is sufficient for its requirements. It is practically exempt from famine, and no relief has ever been needed except in the year 1812.\n\nFor administrative purposes South Kanara is divided into three subdivisions. Coondapoor, comprising the Coondapoor and Udupi t\u0101luks, is usually in charge of a Covenanted Civilian.\n\nAdministration. Mangalore, corresponding to the t\u0101luk of the same name (but including also the Amindivi Islands), and Puttur, comprising the Uppinangadi and K\u0101saragod t\u0101luks, are under Deputy-Collectors recruited in India. A tahsild\u0101r and a stationary sub-magistrate are posted at the head-quarters of each t\u0101luk, and deputy-tahsild\u0101rs at K\u0101rkala, Bantv\u0101l, Beltangadi, and Hosdrug, besides a sub-magistrate for Mangalore town.\n\nCivil justice is administered by a District Judge and a Subordinate Judge at Mangalore, and by District Munsifs at Mangalore, K\u0101saragod, Udupi, Coondapoor, Puttur, and K\u0101rkala. The Court of Session hears the more important criminal cases, but serious crime is not more than usually common, and there are no professional criminal tribes in the District. Offences under the Abk\u0101ri, Salt, and Forest Acts are numerous; and civil disputes are frequently made the ground of criminal charges, especially in connexion with land and inheritance, the majority of the Hindu castes in the District being governed by the Aliya Sant\u0101na law of inheritance, under which a man\u2019s heirs are not his own but his sister\u2019s sons.\n\nLittle is known of the early revenue history of the District. Tradition gives one-sixth of the gross produce, estimated at first in unhusked and latterly in husked rice, as the share demanded by the government prior to the ascendancy of Vijayanagar. About 1336, in the time of Harihara, the first of the kings of that line, the land revenue system was revised. One-half of the gross produce was apportioned to the cultivator, one-quarter to the landlord, one-sixth to the government, and one-twelfth to the gods and to Br\u0101hmans. This arrangement thinly disguised an addition of 50 per cent. to the land revenue; and the assumed share of the gods and Br\u0101hmans, being collected by the\ngovernment, was entirely at its disposal. In 1618 the Ikkeri R\u0101j\u0101s of Bedn\u016br imposed an additional assessment of 50 per cent. on all the District except the Mangalore hobli, and at a later date imposed a tax on fruit trees. These additions were permanently added to the standard revenue. Other additions were made from time to time, amounting in 1762, when Haidar conquered Kanara, to a further 25 per cent. of the standard revenue, but still not sufficient to affect seriously the prosperity of the District. Haidar cancelled the deductions previously allowed on waste lands and imposed other additions, so that at his death the extras exceeded the standard revenue. The further exactions and oppressions of Tip\u016b were such that much land went out of cultivation, collections showed deficiencies ranging from 10 to 60 per cent., and the District was so impoverished that little land had any saleable value.\n\nMajor (afterwards Sir Thomas) Munro, the first Collector of the District, setting aside all merely nominal imposts and assessments on waste lands, imposed on Kanara and Sonda (the present Districts of North and South Kanara) a new settlement in 1799-1800. Some slight reductions were made in the following year. It worked smoothly for some time; then difficulty in the collections and signs of deterioration owing to over-assessment induced the Board of Revenue to order a revision, based on the average collections from each estate since the country came under the British Government. This assessment, introduced in 1819-20, was till recently in force in South Kanara, with the exception of a portion of the Uppinangadi t\u012bluk which was subsequently taken over from Coorg. Continued difficulty in realizing the demand, owing to low prices and riotous assemblages of the cultivators, who refused to pay their assessment, led to a Member of the Board of Revenue being deputed in 1831 to inquire into the state of the District. He reported that the disturbances were due to official intrigues, that the assessment was on the whole moderate, though low prices had caused some distress, and that where over-assessment existed it was due entirely to the unequal incidence of the settlement, aggravated by the frauds of the village accountants, who had complete control over the public records. In accordance with his views, some relief was granted in the settlement for 1833-4 to those estates which were over-assessed. The Board did not, however, regard these measures as satisfactory. Further correspondence confirmed the view that any attempt to base a redistribution of the assessment on the accounts then available was doomed to failure, owing to their fallacious nature. The Board therefore expressed the opinion that the only remedy was a settlement based on a correct survey. This proposal involved a consideration of the question whether any pledge had been given for the fixity of the settlement of 1819-20. After further correspondence\nbetween the Collectors, the Board, and the Government, the question was dropped in 1851, the improvement in prices having meanwhile relieved the pressure of assessment on particular estates.\n\nIn 1880 the matter was again raised by the Government of India, in connexion with the general revision of settlements in the Presidency; and it was finally determined that the Government was in no way pledged to maintain the assessment unaltered, and that the survey and revision of settlement should be extended to Kanara in due course. A survey was begun in 1889 and settlement operations in October, 1894. A scheme was sanctioned for all the taluks and has now been brought into operation. Under this the average assessment on 'dry' land is Rs. 0-9-7 per acre (maximum Rs. 2, minimum 2 annas); on 'wet' land Rs. 4-7-11 (maximum Rs. 10, including charge for second crop; minimum 12 annas); and on garden land Rs. 4-13-7 (maximum Rs. 8, minimum Rs. 2). The proposals anticipate an ultimate increase in the assessment of the District of Rs. 9,22,000, or 65 per cent., over the former revenue.\n\nThe revenue from land and the total revenue in recent years are given below, in thousands of rupees:\n\n|                | 1880-1 | 1890-1 | 1900-1 | 1903-4 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Land revenue   | 13.38  | 14.69  | 15.26  | 17.05  |\n| Total revenue  | 17.90  | 21.03  | 25.41  | 27.76  |\n\nOutside the municipality of Mangalore, local affairs are managed by the District board and the three taluk boards of Coondapoor, Mangalore, and Puttur, the areas in charge of which correspond with the subdivisions of the same names. Their total expenditure in 1903-4 was Rs. 2,82,000, of which Rs. 1,57,000 was laid out on roads and buildings. The chief source of income is, as usual, the land cess. South Kanara contains none of the Unions which on the east coast control the affairs of many of the smaller towns.\n\nThe police are in charge of a District Superintendent, whose headquarters are at Mangalore. The force numbers 10 inspectors and 558 constables, and there are 50 police stations. Village police do not exist.\n\nThere is a District jail at Mangalore, and 8 subsidiary jails at the head-quarters of the tahsildars and their deputies have accommodation for 85 males and 35 females.\n\nAt the Census of 1901 South Kanara stood eleventh among the Districts of the Presidency in the literacy of its population, 5.8 per cent. (11.1 males and 0.9 females) being able to read and write. Education is most advanced in the Mangalore taluk, and most backward in the hilly inland taluk of Uppinangadi. In 1880-1 the number\nof pupils of both sexes under instruction in the District numbered 6,178; in 1890-1, 18,688; in 1900-1, 24,311; and in 1903-4, 27,684. On March 31, 1904, the number of educational institutions of all kinds was 658, of which 502 were classed as public and 156 as private. The public institutions included 474 primary, 23 secondary, and 3 special schools, and 2 colleges. The girls in all of these numbered 4,107, besides 1,566 under instruction in elementary private schools. Six of the public institutions were managed by the Educational department, 85 by local boards, and 7 by the Mangalore municipality, while 278 were aided from public funds, and 126 were unaided but conformed to the rules of the department. Of the male population of school-going age in 1903-4, 21 per cent. were in the primary stage of instruction, and of the female population of the same age 4 per cent. Among Musalmans, the corresponding percentages were 30 and 6 respectively. Education, especially that of girls, is most advanced in the Christian community. Two schools provide for the education of Panchamas or depressed castes, and are attended by 37 pupils. The two Arts colleges are the St. Aloysius College, a first-grade aided institution, and the second-grade Government College, both at Mangalore. The former was established in 1880 by the Jesuit Fathers. The total expenditure on education in 1903-4 was Rs. 2,22,000, of which Rs. 77,000, or 35 per cent., was derived from fees; and 53 per cent. of the total was devoted to primary education.\n\nThe District possesses 8 hospitals and 11 dispensaries, with accommodation for 75 in-patients. In 1903 the number of cases treated was 135,000, including 1,600 in-patients, and 3,200 operations were performed. The expenditure was Rs. 38,000, which was mostly met from Local and municipal funds.\n\nIn 1903-4 the number of persons successfully vaccinated was 28,000, or 23 per 1,000 of the population. Vaccination is compulsory only in the Mangalore municipality.\n\n[J. Sturrock and H. A. Stuart, *District Manual* (1894).]\n\n**Kan\u0101rak.**\u2014Temple in Puri District, Bengal. See Konarak.\n\n**Kanaud Town.**\u2014Head-quarters of the Mohindargarh niz\u0101mat and tahsil, Patiala State, Punjab, situated in 28\u00b0 16' N. and 76\u00b0 13' E., 24 miles south of D\u0101ri. Population (1901), 9,684. Kanaud was founded by Malik Mahd\u016bd Kh\u0101n, a servant of B\u0101bar, and first peopled, it is said, by Br\u0101hmans of the Kanaudia s\u0101s\u0101n or group, from whom it takes its name. It remained a pargana of the sark\u0101r of N\u0101rnaul under the Mughal emperors, and about the beginning of the eighteenth century was conquered by the Th\u0101kur of Jaipur, who was in turn expelled by Naw\u0101b Najaf Kuli Kh\u0101n, the great minister of Sh\u0101h Alam. On his death his widow maintained her independence in the fortress, but in 1792 Sindhia's general, De Boigne, sent a force against it under\nPerron. Ismail Beg persuaded its mistress to resist, and marched to her relief; but she was killed in the battle which ensued under the walls of K\u0101naud, and Ismail Beg surrendered to Perron. K\u0101naud then became the principal stronghold of Appa Khande Rao, Sindhia\u2019s feudatory, who held the Rew\u0101r\u012b territory, and eventually became a possession of the British, by whom it was granted to the Naw\u0101b of Jhajjar. By the sanad of January 4, 1861, the British Government granted parganas K\u0101naud and Kuddh\u016b\u0101na to the Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101 of Pati\u0101la, with all rights pertaining thereto, in lieu of 19\u00b74 lakhs. The town has an Anglo-veracular middle school, a dispensary, and a police station. The fort of K\u0101naud, known as Mohindargarh, contains the headquarters offices of the Mohindargarh niz\u0101mat and tahsil.\n\nKanauj Tahsil (Kannauj).\u2014South-eastern tahsil of Farrukh\u0101b\u0101d District, United Provinces, conterminous with the pargana of the same name, lying along the Ganges, between 26\u00b0 56\u2032 and 27\u00b0 12\u2032 N. and 79\u00b0 43\u2032 and 80\u00b0 1\u2032 E., with an area of 181 square miles. Population decreased from 117,229 in 1891 to 114,215 in 1901. There are 206 villages and one town, Kanauj (population, 18,552). The demand for land revenue in 1903\u20134 was Rs. 1,95,000, and for cesses Rs. 31,000. The density of population, 631 persons per square mile, is above the District average. The tahsil consists of two parts: the uplands or b\u0101ngar, and the lowlands near the Ganges, or kachoh\u0101, the former covering the larger area. The K\u0101li Nadi (East) crosses the tahsil and joins the Ganges. In 1903\u20134 the area under cultivation was 124 square miles, of which 43 were irrigated. Irrigation is supplied almost entirely from wells, and the tract is liable to suffer in dry seasons. This was the only tahsil in the District which lost in population between 1891 and 1901.\n\nKanauj Town (Kannauj).\u2014Ancient city in Farrukh\u0101b\u0101d District, United Provinces, situated in 27\u00b0 3\u2032 N. and 79\u00b0 56\u2032 E., 2 miles from the grand trunk road and the Cawnpore-Achhner\u0101 Railway, and close to the K\u0101li Nadi (East). The Ganges once flowed below its walls, but is now some miles away. Population (1901), 18,552. The town finds no mention in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, but the legend of its foundation is given in the R\u0101m\u0101yana. Kusin\u0101bha, the founder, had a hundred daughters, all but the youngest of whom scorned the hermit, V\u0101yu. In revenge he cursed them, and their backs became humped, whence the city was called K\u0101nya-kubja, or \u2018the crooked maiden.\u2019 Early in the Christian era Ptolemy refers to Kanauj as Kamogiza. The town was included in the Gupta dominions in the fifth century; and when the Gupta empire fell to pieces it became the capital of the Maukharis, one of the petty dynasties which arose in its place. In the sixth century it suffered from war with the White Huns and their ally, the king of M\u0101lw\u0101; but early in the seventh century it was included in\nthe great empire of Harshavardhana in Northern India. The Chinese pilgrim, Hiuen Tsiang, who visited this monarch and travelled with him from Allahabad to Kanauj, describes the magnificence of his court. Harshavardhana's death was the signal for anarchy, and the detailed history of the following years is unknown. In the latter half of the ninth century a dynasty of Raghuvansi kings reigned from Kanauj, which was also called Mahodaya, over an extensive dominion. One of these kings was defeated in 917 by the king of Gujar\u0101t, but restored by the Chandel king of Mahob\u0101. In 1019 Mahm\u016bd of Ghazni plundered Kanauj, which now came into the power of the R\u0101thors, the most celebrated of whom was Gobind Chand (1115-55). Nearly 200 years later, in 1194, Muhammad Ghori defeated Jai Chand, the last of the R\u0101thor kings, and the great kingdom of Kanauj came to an end.\n\nUnder the Muhammadans Kanauj became the seat of a governor, but lost its old importance. In the fifteenth century it was included for some years in the Sharki kingdom of Jaunpur; and when Mahm\u016bd, son of Firoz Tughlak, lost his hold on Delhi, he resided here for a time. It was close to Kanauj, though across the Ganges in Hardoi District, that Humayun was defeated by Sher Shah. Under Akbar, when order had once been restored, Kanauj entered on a long period of peace, and it is recorded in the Ain-i-Akbari as the head-quarters of a sarkar. During the eighteenth century it belonged sometimes to the Nawabs of Farrukhabad, again to the Nawabs of Oudh, and at times to the Marathas. The town or kingdom of Kanauj has given its name to an important division of Brahmans, and to many subdivisions of lower castes. Of the Hindu buildings which must have graced the place, nothing remains intact. The fine Jama Masjid, built in 1406 by Ibrahim Shah of Jaunpur, was constructed from Hindu temples, and the site is still known to Hindus as Sit\u0101 ki rasoi, or 'Sit\u0101's kitchen.'\n\nThere are many tombs and shrines in the neighbourhood, the most notable being those of Makhdum Jahaniya south-east of the town, and of Makhdum Akhai Jamshid 3 miles away, both dating from the fifteenth century. The most conspicuous buildings are, however, the tombs of Bal\u0101 Pir and his son, Shaikh Mahdi, religious teachers who flourished under Shah Jah\u0101n and Aurangzeb. The neighbourhood for miles along the river is studded with ruins, which have not been explored. The town lies on the edge of the old high bank of the Ganges, and, but for the high mounds and buildings described above, is not distinguishable from many places of similar size. The houses are fairly well built but small, and the most conspicuous modern building is a fine sarai recently completed. The dispensary, tahsili, and munshi are at Sarai Miran, 2 miles south of Kanauj. The town is administered under Act XX of 1856, with an income of about Rs. 4,000. It is famous for its scent distilleries, where rose-water, otto\nof roses, and other perfumes are produced, which have a great reputation. Calico-printing is also carried on, but is not so important an industry here as in Farrukhabad city. There was formerly a small manufacture of country paper, and a cotton gin has been worked at intervals in the last few years. The town school has 113 pupils and two primary schools 96. There is also a flourishing aided school, housed in a fine building.\n\n**Kanaung.**\u2014Northern township of Henzada District, Lower Burma, lying between $17^\\circ 54'$ and $18^\\circ 19'$ N. and $94^\\circ 48'$ and $95^\\circ 31'$ E., with an area of 615 square miles. The population increased from 79,499 in 1891 to 92,365 in 1901, the density being 150 persons per square mile. The township extends from the Arakan Yoma in the west to the Irrawaddy, widening as it approaches the river. About one-third is uncultivable, being covered by the spurs of the Yoma. The lands in the western part are protected by embankments and fertile. The population consists almost entirely of Burmans, Karens, and Chins, in the proportions of 92, 6, and $\\frac{1}{2}$ per 100. There are 428 villages and one town, Myanaung (population, 6,351). Kanaung (891) is the head-quarters. The area cultivated in 1903\u20134 was 149 square miles, paying Rs. 2,25,000 land revenue.\n\n**Kanawar.**\u2014The upper or north-eastern subdivision of Bashahr State, Punjab, consisting in great part of the valley of the Upper Sutlej. It lies between $31^\\circ 7'$ and $32^\\circ 5'$ N. and $77^\\circ 48'$ and $79^\\circ 4'$ E. It is bounded on the north by Spiti; on the east by Chinese territory; on the south by Bashahr proper and Tehri; and on the west by the Kochi subdivision of Bashahr. The estimated area is 1,730 square miles, and the population in 1901 was 17,741.\n\nKanawar is a rugged country, 50 miles in length by 40 in breadth, through whose ridges winds the deeply cleft valley of the Sutlej. The precipitous banks of the main river afford little room for cultivation, but the valleys of its tributaries are assiduously tilled by the mountaineers. Until about forty-five years ago, grapes yielded an abundant vintage, being manufactured into raisin wine and strong spirit. Vine disease subsequently reduced the vintage to a quarter of what it once was, but has recently subsided. The population consists of a mixed Tibetan and Hindu race, the Mongolian element preponderating in the north, while the southern region is inhabited by persons of Aryan type. Alone among the neighbouring hill tribes, the Kanawaris successfully resisted the Gurkha invasion, and so completely baffled the enemy by breaking down bridges, that the Gurkhas entered into a convention by which, in return for a tribute of Rs. 11,250, they agreed to leave the valley unmolested. Polyandry exists in its fullest form throughout Kanawar. Religion, broadly speaking, follows race. The northern villages profess Buddhism of the Tibetan model; in the south Hin-\nduism prevails, while the middle region shades off gradually from one faith into the other. The language varies, like the religion, from Tibetan in the north to neo-Sanskritic dialects on the Indian side. The chief villages in the valley are Sangnam and Kanum.\n\n**Kanbalu Subdivision.**\u2014Subdivision of Shwebo District, Upper Burma, containing the Kanbalu and Kyunhla townships.\n\n**Kanbalu Township.**\u2014North-eastern township of Shwebo District, Upper Burma, lying between the Mu and the Irrawaddy rivers, between $22^\\circ 51'$ and $23^\\circ 44'$ N. and $95^\\circ 22'$ and $96^\\circ 1'$ E., with an area of 1,636 square miles. The country is dry and flat, and only the south-western corner is at all thickly populated. The population was 31,872 in 1891, and 44,783 in 1901, distributed in 259 villages, Kanbalu (population, 1,003), on the railway, being the head-quarters. The area cultivated in 1903\u20134 was 132 square miles, and the land revenue and *thathameda* amounted to Rs. 64,300.\n\n**K\u0101nchenjanga.**\u2014Mountain in Sikkim State, Bengal. See KINCHINJUNGA.\n\n**Kanchivaram.**\u2014Taluk and town in Chingleput District, Madras. See CONJEEVERAM.\n\n**K\u0101nchr\u0101p\u0101ra.**\u2014Village in the Barrackpore subdivision, District of the Twenty-four Parganas, Bengal, situated in $22^\\circ 57'$ N. and $88^\\circ 26'$ E. Population (1901), 1,545. K\u0101nchr\u0101p\u0101ra is an important station on the Eastern Bengal State Railway, and the railway workshops are situated here. It lies within the HALISAHAR municipality.\n\n**Kandah\u0101r Province.**\u2014Province of Afghanistan, bounded on the north by the Taimani country in the Her\u0101t province, and by the Hazaraj\u0101t and Ghazni districts of K\u0101bul; on the east and south by Baluchist\u0101n; and on the west by Farrah. Within the administrative charge of the *naib-ul-hukum\u0101* (governor) of Kandah\u0101r are comprised the division of Chakans\u016br, and the minor divisions or districts of Kal\u0101t-i-Ghilzai, M\u0101kur, Pusht-i-R\u016bd, Zamindawar, and Girishk.\n\nThe province is divided into two well-marked portions, differing essentially from each other in character, by a line drawn from Kandah\u0101r to Farrah. North of this line, and also to the north-east, the country is hilly, and gradually becomes more mountainous northwards. The general elevation of portions of Pusht-i-R\u016bd and Zamindawar is about 4,000 feet, while in the Bhagni tract of Pusht-i-R\u016bd there are mountains of 10,000 feet in altitude. In the north-east Kal\u0101t-i-Ghilzai is 5,543 feet above sea-level, and in its neighbourhood are peaks of not less than 9,500 feet. South of the dividing line above mentioned, the elevation is at first between 2,000 and 2,500 feet, but it rapidly decreases. The country watered by the lower courses of the Har\u016bt, Farrah, and Helmand is open, forming the only plains of Afghanistan proper. To the south of Kandah\u0101r city is the desert of Regist\u0101n: in\nthe south-west lies the great Afghan-Seistan desert. The province is drained by the Kadenai, Tarnak, Arghastan, Arghandab, Helmand, Harut, and Farrah Rud rivers. Rising in the mountains north of the province, the Helmand with its tributaries eventually loses itself in the Seistan Hamun.\n\nThe name of the province seems to connect it with the Indian people known to the Greeks as Gandarii, but the present inhabitants are almost entirely Durrani. The towns contain a considerable number of Parsiwans (people of Persian descent), while in Kandahar city there are about 5,000 Hindus. No reliable estimate of the total population can be given.\n\nThe climate varies considerably; that of the deserts is excessively trying, but with this exception it is on the whole good. In the mountainous regions the winters are severe, but elsewhere the cold is not great.\n\nKandahar City.\u2014Capital of the Kandahar province of Afghanistan, situated in $31^\\circ 27'$ N. and $65^\\circ 43'$ E., 354 miles from Herat by the shortest route, 313 from Kabul via Maidan, and about 62 miles from the British border at New Chaman; 3,462 feet above the sea. The city is situated between the Tarnak and Arghandab rivers on a level plain, intersected by numerous canals, and highly cultivated and well populated to the south and west, but barren to the north, northwest, and north-east. It forms an irregular oblong, longest from north to south, with a circuit of over 3 miles. It is surrounded by a ditch 24 feet wide and 10 feet deep, and by a wall 27 feet in height. There are six gates, two each on the east and west, and one on the north and on the south. The four principal streets are about 40 yards wide, and are named after the gates to which they lead from the Charasu, their point of intersection. Smaller and narrower streets branch from the main arteries towards the city walls. Kandahar is divided into four quarters, the various tribes which constitute the inhabitants occupying, to a great extent, separate portions. The different classes of merchants and shopkeepers also occupy separate streets, or portions of streets, in the various quarters. The houses are generally built of sun-dried bricks, and are flat-roofed, some with upper storeys. Those of the rich are enclosed by high walls, and many contain three or four courts, with gardens and fountains. The citadel is situated at the north of the city. South of it is an open space called the Topkhana; west is another open space in which is situated the tomb of Ahmad Shah Durrani. This structure overtops all the surrounding buildings, and its lofty dome attracts the attention of the traveller approaching the city from a distance. There are more than 180 Sunni mosques in the city, of which the Khirka Mubarak, a place of sanctuary (bast), is the most celebrated. Notwithstanding the large number of Shia inhabitants, there is no\nShiah mosque. A commodious caravanserai exists outside the eastern gate for the storage of wool and other goods going to India.\n\nThe total population of Kandah\u0101r city is estimated at 31,000, among whom Parsiw\u0101ns predominate. There are about 1,600 shops, and a ganj where a large cattle, sheep, and grain market is held daily. The usual water-supply is derived, by numerous canals, from the Arghand\u0101b, but an ample supply is also available from wells. The climate of Kandah\u0101r is not salubrious, probably owing to the want of sanitation and to the large graveyards on one side and the marshes on the other. The rainfall is small, and occurs during the winter and early spring. In the summer months the heat is intense. The temperature varies greatly between sunrise and mid-day, sometimes by as much as 40\u00b0 or 50\u00b0.\n\nKandah\u0101r is famous for its fruits, which are as plentiful as they are good: apricots, peaches, pomegranates, grapes, figs, and melons are all excellent of their kind and, fresh or dry, are largely exported. A considerable amount of tobacco is also grown for export to India.\n\nKandah\u0101r is one of the principal trade centres in Afgh\u0101nist\u0101n. There are no manufactures or industries of any importance peculiar to the city; but the long lines of bazars display goods from Great Britain, India, Russia, Persia, and Turkist\u0101n, embracing a trade area as large probably as that of any city in Asia. The customs and towns dues together amount to a sum equal to the land revenue of the entire province. The Hindus are the most numerous and the wealthiest merchants in Kandah\u0101r, carrying on a profitable trade with Bombay and Sind. They import British manufactures, e.g., silks, calicoes, muslins, chintzes, broadcloth, and hardware; and Indian produce, such as indigo, spices, and sugar. They export asafoetida, madder, wool, dried fruits, tobacco, silk, rosaries, &c. In 1903-4 the exports to India from Kandah\u0101r were valued at nearly 35 lakhs, and the imports at 33 lakhs.\n\nFrom early times Kandah\u0101r must have been a town of much importance in Asia, as being the central point at which the roads from Her\u0101t, Seist\u0101n, Ghor, K\u0101bul, and India unite. The position did not escape the notice of Alexander the Great, and Kandah\u0101r (Alexandria Arach\u014dton) is probably one of the cities that he founded or rebuilt. After being a portion of the Seleucid, Parthian, Sassanid, and Arab empires, Kandah\u0101r, on the break-up of the Khalifat, fell successively to the Persian Saff\u0101rids and S\u0101m\u0101nids, to the house of Ghazni, the Selj\u016bks, the Ghorids, and the Sh\u0101hs of Khw\u0101rizm, and in 1222 it was captured by the Mongols under Chingiz Kh\u0101n. From his descendants it passed for a time to the Kart dynasty of Her\u0101t, an offshoot of the Ghorids, and in 1389 it was taken by Tim\u016br Lang. Between 1468 and 1512 it was under local chiefs, but in the latter year it was recovered for\nthe Tim\u016brids by B\u0101bar, the founder of the Mughal empire. After his death Kandah\u0101r was a constant subject of contention between the Mughals and the Persian Safavids; and after being several times captured and recaptured by one or the other, it finally passed out of Mughal possession in 1648, the subsequent efforts of Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n's sons, Aurangzeb and D\u0101r\u0101 Shikoh, to recover it proving fruitless. In 1708 the Ghilzais of Kandah\u0101r threw off the Persian yoke, and a few years later defeated the Safavids in Persia itself. Persian rule was restored for a short time by N\u0101dir Sh\u0101h, who destroyed the city in 1738 and built a new one. The old city is now known as Shahr-i-Kohna, and its ruins lie at the base of a bare rocky hill 3 miles to the west of the present town. N\u0101dir Sh\u0101h's foundation was in turn destroyed by his Afgh\u0101n successor, Ahmad Sh\u0101h, who founded the existing city in 1747. In 1834 Sh\u0101h Shuj\u0101, the dispossessed (Sadozai) king of Afgh\u0101nist\u0101n, attempted to re-establish himself in Kandah\u0101r, but he was driven off by his B\u0101rakzai rival, Dost Muhammad, who, after his victory, took the title of Am\u012br.\n\nThis was the last unaided attempt of the Sadozais to retake Kandah\u0101r. The next time Sh\u0101h Shuj\u0101 appeared on the field it was with the support of the British Government. The Army of the Indus occupied Kandah\u0101r in April, 1839, and Sh\u0101h Shuj\u0101 was crowned there in May. While the restored king with the main British army marched on K\u0101bul, a force was left under General Nott to hold Kandah\u0101r. In 1842, after the revolt at K\u0101bul and the massacre of Burnes and Macnaghten, an attack was made on the city by large bodies of Afgh\u0101ns under Safdar Jang Sadozai, but it was beaten off with heavy loss, and a fresh attempt soon after was equally unsuccessful. In August, 1842, Nott marched to K\u0101bul, and Safdar Jang then took possession of Kandah\u0101r, only to be driven out four months afterwards by Kohan Dil Kh\u0101n, who had come from Persia. On the death of the latter in 1855 his son, Muhammad S\u0101dik, held the city for a short time until Dost Muhammad took possession in November of the same year. Dost Muhammad appointed his son, Ghul\u0101m Haidar Kh\u0101n, governor, and on his death in 1858 Sher Ali Kh\u0101n succeeded him. On the latter becoming Am\u012br, he appointed his full brother, Muhammad Amin Kh\u0101n, to be governor. This chief rebelled and was killed in battle in 1865. Kandah\u0101r again fell into Sher Ali's hands; passed from his grasp to that of his half-brother and rival, Az\u012bm Kh\u0101n, in 1867; and again fell into the power of Sher Ali, through his son, Yak\u016bb Kh\u0101n, in 1868.\n\nDuring the last Afgh\u0101n War Kandah\u0101r was occupied by British troops in January, 1879; and in May, 1880, Sard\u0101r Sher Ali Kh\u0101n was installed as Wali of the Kandah\u0101r province, which was to be independent of K\u0101bul. In July, Sard\u0101r Muhammad Ay\u016bb Kh\u0101n, a younger\nbrother of Yak\u016bb Kh\u0101n, advancing from Her\u0101t, inflicted a crushing defeat on a brigade of British troops at Maiwand and invested Kandah\u0101r. A relieving force under General Roberts left K\u0101bul on August 8, arrived at Kandah\u0101r on the 31st, and on September 1 totally defeated Ay\u016bb, whose camp, artillery, and baggage were captured, the Sard\u0101r escaping with a handful of followers. The victory immediately quieted the country, and the last of the British forces evacuated Southern Afghanistan in April, 1881. Sher Ali Kh\u0101n had found himself too weak to maintain the position conferred on him, and had retired, at his own request, to India, where he ended his days as a British pensioner. Within three months of the British withdrawal, Ay\u016bb Kh\u0101n, who had been maintaining himself with spirit at Her\u0101t, again took the field, and, after defeating Abdur Rahm\u0101n\u2019s troops, occupied Kandah\u0101r. He was, however, utterly defeated by the Am\u012br in September, 1881, and fled towards Her\u0101t; but that city had, meanwhile, been occupied by one of the Am\u012br\u2019s lieutenants, and Ay\u016bb Kh\u0101n had to seek refuge in Persia. He came to India in 1888, and has since resided there.\n\n**Kandah\u0101r.**\u2014Western t\u0101luk of N\u0101nder District, Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State, with an area of 680 square miles. The population in 1901, including j\u0101girs, was 97,728, compared with 128,525 in 1891, the decrease being due to the famine of 1900. Kandah\u0101r contained till recently one town, Mukkher (population, 6,148), the head-quarters; and 190 villages, of which 37 are j\u0101gir. The land revenue in 1901 was 2.5 lakhs. Regar forms its predominant soil. In 1905 the t\u0101luk was enlarged by the addition of some villages from Osm\u0101nnagar.\n\n**Kandh.**\u2014Tribe in the Central Provinces and Madras. See Khond.\n\n**Kandhkot.**\u2014T\u0101luka of the Upper Sind Frontier District, Sind, Bombay, lying between 27\u00b0 59' and 28\u00b0 27' N. and 68\u00b0 57' and 69\u00b0 22' E., with an area of 543 square miles. The population in 1901 was 48,723, compared with 30,369 in 1891. The density, 90 persons per square mile, approximates to the District average. The t\u0101luka contains 82 villages, of which Kandhkot is the head-quarters. The land revenue and cesses in 1903\u20134 amounted to nearly 1.9 lakhs. The t\u0101luka depends for irrigation upon the Beg\u0101ri, Unhar Wah, and Desert Canals, the canals from the Kashmor Band, and upon river floods.\n\n**K\u0101ndhla.**\u2014Town in the Budh\u0101na tahsil of Muzaffarnagar District, United Provinces, situated in 29\u00b0 19' N. and 77\u00b0 16' E., near the Eastern Jumna Canal, 29 miles south-west of Muzaffarnagar town. Population (1902), 11,563. It is situated on low ground and the neighbourhood is swampy. The more important streets are metalled and drained. K\u0101ndhla was constituted a municipality in 1872. The income and expenditure during the ten years ending 1901 averaged\nRs. 6,700. In 1903\u20134 the income was Rs. 11,000, chiefly derived from octroi (Rs. 6,600); and the expenditure was Rs. 11,000. There is a considerable local trade in grain, cotton, and cloth, which is manufactured here. The tahsil school had 130 pupils in 1904.\n\n**Kandhm\u0101ls.**\u2014Subdivision in Angul District, Bengal. See Khondm\u0101ls.\n\n**K\u0101ndi Subdivision.**\u2014South-western subdivision of Murshid\u0101b\u0101d District, Bengal, lying between 23\u00b0 43\u2032 and 24\u00b0 12\u2032 N. and 87\u00b0 50\u2032 and 88\u00b0 14\u2032 E., with an area of 512 square miles. The subdivision, which is watered by the Bh\u0101girathi and Dw\u0101rka rivers, consists for the most part of undulating country, but near those rivers the land is alluvial and low-lying. The population in 1901 was 334,053, compared with 297,122 in 1891, the density being 652 persons per square mile. It contains one town, K\u0101ndi (population, 12,037), its head-quarters; and 883 villages.\n\n**K\u0101ndi Town.**\u2014Head-quarters of the subdivision of the same name in Murshid\u0101b\u0101d District, Bengal, situated in 23\u00b0 58\u2032 N. and 88\u00b0 3\u2032 E., near the Mor river. Population (1901), 12,037. K\u0101ndi owes much of its importance to the fact that it is the residence of the R\u0101j\u0101s of Paikp\u0101ra, a wealthy and devout Hindu family. The founder of this family was Gang\u0101 Gobind Singh, a banian of Warren Hastings, who was born at K\u0101ndi, and retired thither in his old age with an immense fortune, which he devoted to the erection of shrines and images of Krishna. His name has acquired a traditional celebrity for the most magnificent sraddha or funeral obsequies ever performed in Bengal, costing 20 lakhs, in honour of his mother. K\u0101ndi was constituted a municipality in 1869. The income and expenditure during the decade ending 1901\u20132 averaged Rs. 7,000. In 1903\u20134 the income was Rs. 9,000, mainly from a tax on persons; and the expenditure was Rs. 8,000. The town contains the usual public offices, a sub-jail with accommodation for 24 prisoners, and a dispensary with 24 beds. The latter is maintained from the proceeds of an endowment fund, now amounting to 1.59 lakhs, left by the late Kum\u0101r Giris Chandra Sinha of Paikp\u0101ra, and is the best-equipped hospital in the District.\n\n**K\u0101ndi.**\u2014Village in the Kalabg\u016br t\u0101luk of Medak District, Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State, situated in 17\u00b0 35\u2032 N. and 78\u00b0 6\u2032 E., 5 miles south-east of Sangareddipet. Population (1901), 1,573. Upon the open plain close by stand two stones with Telugu or old Kanarese inscriptions, surmounted by the sun and moon.\n\n**Kandi\u0101ro T\u0101luka.**\u2014T\u0101luka of Hyder\u0101b\u0101d District, Sind, Bombay, lying between 26\u00b0 55\u2032 and 27\u00b0 14\u2032 N. and 68\u00b0 2\u2032 and 68\u00b0 30\u2032 E., with an area of 320 square miles. The population in 1901 was 62,937, compared with 55,733 in 1891. The density, 197 persons per square mile, is, after Hyder\u0101b\u0101d t\u0101luka, the highest in the\nDistrict. The number of villages is 69, of which Kandi\u0101ro is the head-quarters. Land revenue and cesses in 1903\u20134 amounted to more than 1\u00bd lakhs. The surface of the t\u0101luka has the appearance of two large land waves with three depressions; and throughout its length on the river bank it is protected by a belt of forests. About two-thirds of the total is irrigated by canals, aided by wells. The chief crops are wheat, jow\u0101r, and gram.\n\nKandi\u0101ro Village.\u2014Head-quarters of the t\u0101luka of the same name in Hyder\u0101b\u0101d District, Sind, Bombay, situated in 27\u00b0 3\u2032 N. and 68\u00b0 17\u2032 E., on the Nasrat canal. Population (1901), 3,916. The principal occupation of the inhabitants is agriculture, but the Hindus are engaged in trade, which is mainly in grain and cloth. The village is said to have been built during the reign of Jah\u0101ng\u012br. Before it was founded another was in existence close by, called Patoipur, which was abandoned owing to an unusual rise of the inundation waters. The site of the present village was then chosen as being more elevated; and having at the time a large number of kandi trees growing upon it, the place took, it is supposed, from this circumstance the name of Kandi\u0101ro. Kandi\u0101ro has a technical school supported by the local board with an average daily attendance of 80 students, 6 other schools, of which 2 are for girls, and a dispensary.\n\nKanduk\u016br Subdivision.\u2014Subdivision of Nellore District, Madras, consisting of the t\u0101luks of Kanduk\u016br and Kanagiri and the zamin-d\u0101r\u012b tahsils of D\u0101rsi and Podili.\n\nKanduk\u016br T\u0101luk.\u2014Coast t\u0101luk of Nellore District, Madras, lying between 14\u00b0 58\u2032 and 15\u00b0 30\u2032 N. and 79\u00b0 38\u2032 and 80\u00b0 5\u2032 E., with an area of 787 square miles. The population in 1901 was 151,417, compared with 148,475 in 1891. It contains one town, Kanduk\u016br (population, 9,569), the head-quarters; and 161 villages. The demand on account of land revenue and cesses in 1903\u20134 amounted to Rs. 3,58,000. The t\u0101luk may before long be well supplied with irrigation, as it will be commanded by the great Tungabhadra-Penner and Kistna projects. The Manneru with its affluent, the Upputeru, the Paleru, the M\u016bsi, and the Velikeru are the chief rivers. The Manneru feeds the Karedu tank, but the others are at present undeveloped as sources of irrigation.\n\nKanduk\u016br Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the t\u0101luk of the same name in Nellore District, Madras, situated in 15\u00b0 13\u2032 N. and 79\u00b0 54\u2032 E., about 9 miles west of Singar\u0101yakonda railway station and 13 miles from the sea. Population (1901), 9,569, mainly agriculturists. Two ancient temples here are dedicated to Vishnu and Siva.\n\nKaner.\u2014Petty State in K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r, Bombay.\n\nKanethi.\u2014Petty State feudatory to the Bashahr State, Punjab, lying in two portions between 31\u00b0 9\u2032 and 31\u00b0 18\u2032 N. and 77\u00b0 32\u2032 and\n17\u00b0 40' E. The area is 19 square miles, the population (1901) 2,575, and the revenue Rs. 4,000, about half of which is derived from forests. The present Th\u0101kur is Amog Chand, a Hindu Rajput, related to the R\u0101n\u0101 of Kumh\u0101rsain. His territory is bounded by Kumh\u0101rsain, Bashahr, and the Kot Khai pargana of Simla District. The State has suffered much from misgovernment, and it has been necessary to take it under direct management. The Th\u0101kur, who is a minor, is being educated at the Aitchison College; and during his minority the administration is conducted by an official deputed by Government, who exercises full powers, except that sentences of death require the confirmation of the Superintendent, Hill States, Simla. The State pays a tribute of Rs. 900 to Bashahr.\n\nK\u0101ngra District.\u2014North-easternmost District of the Jullundur Division, Punjab, lying between 31\u00b0 21' and 32\u00b0 59' N. and 75\u00b0 37' and 78\u00b0 42' E., with an estimated area of 9,978 square miles. It is bounded on the north-west by Chamba State; on the north by Kashmir territory; on the east by Tibet; on the south-east by Bashahr State; on the south by the Kotgarh villages of Simla District, and by the States of Kumh\u0101rsain, Sangri, Suket, Mandi, and Bil\u0101spur; on the south-west by the District of Hoshi\u0101rpur; and on the west by Gurd\u0101spur. It stretches eastwards from the plains of the B\u0101ri and Jullundur Do\u0101bs across the Him\u0101layan ranges to the borders of Tibet, and comprises two distinct tracts which lie on either side of the Outer Him\u0101layas and present very diverse natural features. Of these two tracts the western block, which constitutes K\u0101ngra proper, is described in this article. This portion, which lies south of the Dhaola Dh\u0101r range of the Outer Him\u0101layas, consists of an irregular triangle, whose base lies upon the Hoshi\u0101rpur border, while the Native States of Chamba and Mand\u012b constrict its upper portion to a narrow neck, known as Bang\u0101hal, at one point less than 10 miles in width. Beyond this, the eastern block expands once more like an hour-glass, and embraces the Kul\u016b subdivision, which comprises the tahsils of Kul\u016b and Sar\u0101j and the mid-Him\u0101layan cantons of L\u0101hul and Spiti, each of which merits separate description.\n\nOf the total estimated area of 9,978 square miles, 2,939 are in K\u0101ngra proper. This is the more important part of the District as regards population and cultivation, and comprises two wide and fertile valleys. The K\u0101ngra valley lies between the Dhaola Dh\u0101r and the long irregular mass of lower hills which run, almost parallel to the Dhaola Dh\u0101r, from north-west to south-south-east. The second valley runs between these hills and the Sola Singhi range, and thus lies parallel to the K\u0101ngra valley. On the north-west the District includes the outlying spurs which form the northern continuation of the Sola Singhi, running down to the banks of the Be\u0101s and Chakki, and it also\nembraces the western slopes of that range to the south. The Kangra valley is famous for its beauty, the charm lying not so much in the rich cultivation and perpetual verdure of the valley itself as in the constant yet ever-changing view of the Dhaola Dh\u0101r, whose snowy peaks rise sheer above the valley, sometimes to 13,000 feet, and present a different phase of beauty at each turn in the road. The taluka of Bang\u0101hal forms the connecting link between Kangra proper and Kul\u016b, and is divided by the Dhaola Dh\u0101r into two parts: to the north Bar\u0101 or Greater Bang\u0101hal, and to the south Chhot\u0101 or Lesser Bang\u0101hal.\n\nAlthough the general trend of the three main ranges which enclose the valleys of Kangra proper is from north-west to south-east-by-south, its one great river, the Be\u0101s, flows through this part of the District from east to west. Entering the centre of its eastern border at the southern head of the Kangra valley, it runs past Suj\u0101npur T\u012bra in a narrow gorge through the central mass of hills, flowing westwards with a southerly trend as far as N\u0101daun. Thence it turns sharply to the north-west, flowing through the valley past Dera Gopipur; and gradually winding westward, it passes between the northern slopes of the Sola Singh\u012b range and the hills forming its continuation to the north. The remainder of the District is singularly devoid of great streams. The Kangra valley is drained by several torrents into the Be\u0101s, the principal of these flowing in deep gorges through the central hills.\n\nAll three facies of the stratified rocks of the Him\u0101layas are to be found. To the north, in Spiti, the Tibetan zone is represented by a series of beds extending in age from Cambrian to Cretaceous; this is separated from the central zone by the granite range between Spiti and Kul\u016b. The rocks of the central zone consist of slates, conglomerate, and limestone, representing the infra-Blaini and overlying systems of the Simla area. Still farther to the south the third or sub-Him\u0101layan zone consists of shales and sandstones (Sirm\u016br series) of Lower Tertiary age, and sandstones and conglomerates belonging to the Upper Tertiary Siw\u0101lik series. The slate or quartz-mica-schist of the central zone is fissile, and of considerable value for roofing purposes; it is quarried at and around Kanhi\u0101ra. Gypsum occurs in large quantity in Lower Spiti.\n\nThe main valley is the chief Siw\u0101lik tract in the Province, but its flora is unfortunately little known. An important feature is the existence of considerable forests of the chir (Pinus longifolia), at comparatively low elevations. Kul\u016b (or the upper valley of the Be\u0101s) has a rich temperate flora at the higher elevations; in the lower valleys and\n\n---\n\n1 Medlicott, 'The Sub-Him\u0101layan Ranges between the Ganges and R\u0101vi,' Memoirs, Geological Survey of India, vol. iii, part ii; Stoliczka, 'Sections across the North-West Him\u0101layas,' Memoirs, Geological Survey of India, vol. v, part i; Hayden, 'Geology of Spiti,' Memoirs, Geological Survey of India, vol. xxxvi, part i.\nin Outer Sar\u0101j (on the right bank of the Sutlej) the vegetation is largely sub-tropical, with a considerable western element, including *Clematis orientalis*, a wild olive, &c. The flora of British L\u0101hul, the Chandra-Bh\u0101ga or Chen\u0101b valley, and Sp\u012bt\u012b, are entirely Tibetan.\n\nThe forests of K\u0101ngra District used to abound in game of all descriptions; and of the larger animals, leopards, bears, hyenas, wolves, and various kinds of deer are still fairly common. Tigers visit the District occasionally, but are not indigenous to these hills. The ibex is found in L\u0101hul, Sp\u012bt\u012b, Kul\u016b, and Bar\u0101 Bang\u0101hal; and the musk deer in Kul\u016b and on the slopes of the Dhaola Dh\u0101r. The wild hog is common in many forests in the lower ranges. Of smaller quadrupeds, the badger, porcupine, pangolin, and otter are commonly found. Different species of wild cat, the flying squirrel, hare, and marmot abound in the hills. The bird-life of both hill and plain is richly represented: and, though game is not very abundant, many species are found. These include several varieties of pheasant, among them the mon\u0101l and argus, the white-crested pheasant, and the red jungle-fowl which is common in the lower valleys. Of partridges many species are found, from the common grey partridge of the plains to the snow partridge of the Upper Him\u0101layas. Quail and snipe sometimes visit the District in considerable numbers. Ducks, geese, and other water-birds are seen upon the Be\u0101s at the beginning and end of summer. Fishing is not carried on to any great extent. Thirty-six fisheries are leased to contractors, mostly on the Be\u0101s, only a few being in the lower parts of the hill torrents.\n\nThe mean temperature at K\u0101ngra town is returned as 53\u00b0 in winter, 70\u00b0 in spring, 80\u00b0 in summer, and 68\u00b0 in autumn. The temperature of the southern portion of K\u0101ngra proper is much higher than this, while that of the inhabited parts of the Dhaola Dh\u0101r is about 8\u00b0 lower. Endemic diseases include fever and goitre. The widespread cultivation of rice, by which the whole K\u0101ngra valley is converted into a swamp, has a very prejudicial effect upon health.\n\nThe rainfall varies remarkably in different parts. The average annual fall exceeds 70 inches: along the side of the Dhaola Dh\u0101r it amounts to over 100; while 10 miles off it falls to about 70, and in the southern parts to about 50. Bar\u0101 Bang\u0101hal, which is on the north side of the Dhaola Dh\u0101r, has a climate of its own. The clouds exhaust themselves on the south side of the great range; and two or three weeks of mist and drizzle represent the monsoon. The rainfall in Kul\u016b is similarly much less than that of K\u0101ngra proper, averaging from 30 to 40 inches, while L\u0101hul and Sp\u012bt\u012b are almost rainless.\n\nA disastrous earthquake occurred on April 4, 1905. About 20,000 human beings perished, the loss of life being heaviest in the K\u0101ngra and Palampur tahsils. The station of Dharm\u015b\u0101la and the town of\nK\u0101ngra were destroyed. The fort and temples at K\u0101ngra received irreparable damage, and many other buildings of archaeological interest were more or less injured.\n\nThe hills of K\u0101ngra proper have formed for many centuries the dominions of numerous petty princes, all of whom traced their descent from the ancient Katoch (R\u0101jp\u00fat) kings of Jullundur. According to the mythical chronology of the Mah\u0101-bh\u0101rata, this dynasty first established itself in the country between the Sutlej and the Be\u0101s 1,500 years before the Christian era. In the seventh century A.D., Hiuen Tsiang, the Chinese Buddhist pilgrim, found the Jullundur monarchy still undivided. At some later period, perhaps that of the Muhammadan invasion, the Katoch princes were driven into the hills, where K\u0101ngra already existed as one of their chief fortresses; and their restricted dominions appear afterwards to have fallen asunder into several minor principalities. Of these, N\u016brpur, Siba, Goler, Bang\u0101hal, and K\u0101ngra are included in K\u0101ngra proper. In spite of constant invasions, the little Hindu kingdoms, secure within their Him\u0101layan glens, long held out against the aggressive Muhammadan power. In 1009 the riches of the Nagarkot temple attracted the attention of Mahm\u016bd of Ghazni, who defeated the Hindu princes at Pesh\u0101war, seized the fort of K\u0101ngra, and plundered the shrine of an immense booty in gold, silver, and jewels. But thirty-five years later the mountaineers rose against the Muhammadan garrison, besieged and retook the fort, with the assistance of the R\u0101j\u0101 of Delhi, and set up a facsimile of the image which Mahm\u016bd had carried away. From this time K\u0101ngra does not reappear in general history till 1360, when the emperor Firoz Tughlak again led a force against it. The R\u0101j\u0101 gave in his submission, and was permitted to retain his dominions; but the Muhammadans once more plundered the temple, and dispatched the famous image to Mecca, where it was cast upon the high road to be trodden under the feet of the faithful.\n\nTwo hundred years later, in 1556, Akbar commanded in person an expedition into the hills, and succeeded in permanently occupying the fort of K\u0101ngra. The fruitful valley became an imperial demesne, and only the barren hills remained in the possession of the native chiefs. In the graphic language of Akbar's famous minister, Todar Mal, 'he cut off the meat and left the bones.' Yet the remoteness of the imperial capital and the natural strength of the mountain fastnesses encouraged the R\u0101jp\u00fat princes to rebel; and it was not until after the imperial forces had been twice repulsed that the fort of K\u0101ngra was starved into surrender to an army commanded by prince Khurr\u0101m in person (1620). On the last occasion twenty-two chieftains promised obedience and tribute, and agreed to send hostages to Agra. At one time Jah\u0101ng\u012br intended to build a summer residence in the valley, and\nthe site of the proposed palace is still pointed out in the lands of the village of Gargari. Probably the superior attractions of Kashm\u012br, which the emperor shortly afterwards visited, led to the abandonment of his design. At the accession of Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n the hill R\u0101j\u0101s had quietly settled down into the position of tributaries, and the commands of the emperor were received and executed with ready obedience. Letters patent (sanads) are still extant, issued between the reigns of Akbar and Aurangzeb, appointing individuals to various judicial and revenue offices, such as that of k\u0101z\u012b, k\u0101nungeo, or ch\u0101udhri. In some instances the present representatives of the family continue to enjoy privileges and powers conferred on their ancestors by the Mughal emperors, the honorary appellation being retained even where the duties have become obsolete.\n\nDuring the period of Muhammadan ascendancy the hill princes appear on the whole to have been treated liberally. They still enjoyed a considerable share of power, and ruled unmolested over the extensive tracts which remained to them. They built forts, waged war upon each other, and wielded the functions of petty sovereigns. On the demise of a chief, his successor paid the fees of investiture, and received a confirmation of his title, with an honorary dress from Agra or Delhi. The loyalty of the hill R\u0101j\u0101s appears to have won the favour and confidence of their conquerors, and they were frequently deputed on hazardous expeditions, and appointed to places of high trust in the service of the empire. Thus in the time of Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n (1646), Jagat Chand, R\u0101j\u0101 of N\u016brpur, at the head of 14,000 R\u0101jputs, raised in his own country, conducted a most difficult but successful enterprise against the Uzbeks of Balkh and Badakhsh\u0101n. Again, in the early part of the reign of Aurangzeb (1661), R\u0101j\u0101 M\u0101ndh\u0101ta, grandson of Jagat Chand, was deputed to the charge of B\u0101mi\u0101n and Ghorband on the western frontier of the Mughal empire, eight days' journey beyond the city of K\u0101bul. Twenty years later he was a second time appointed to this honourable post, and created a mansabd\u0101r of 2,000 horse. In later days (1758), R\u0101j\u0101 Ghamand Chand of K\u0101ngra was appointed governor of the Jullundur Do\u0101b and the hill country between the Sutlej and the R\u0101vi.\n\nIn 1752 the Katoch principalities nominally formed part of the territories ceded to Ahmad Sh\u0101h Durr\u0101ni by the declining Delhi court. But the native chieftains, emboldened by the prevailing anarchy, resumed their practical independence, and left little to the Durr\u0101ni monarch or the deputy who still held the isolated fort of K\u0101ngra for the Mughal empire. In 1774 the Sikh chieftain, Jai Singh, obtained the fort by stratagem, but relinquished it in 1785 to Sans\u0101r Chand, the legitimate R\u0101jput prince of K\u0101ngra, to whom the State was thus restored about two centuries after its occupation by Akbar. This\nprince, by his vigorous measures, made himself supreme throughout the whole Katoch country, and levied tribute from his fellow chieftains in all the neighbouring States. Every year, on fixed occasions, these princes were obliged to attend his court, and to accompany him with their contingents wherever he undertook a military expedition. For twenty years he reigned supreme throughout these hills, and raised his name to a height of renown never attained by any ancestor of his race. He found himself unable, however, to cope with the Sikhs, and two descents upon the Sikh possessions in the plains, in 1803 and 1804, were repelled by Ranjit Singh. In 1805 Sans\u0101r Chand attacked the hill State of Bil\u0101spur (Kahl\u016br), which called in the dangerous aid of the Gurkhas, already masters of the wide tract between the Gogra and the Sutlej. The Gurkhas responded by crossing the latter river and attacking the Katochs at Mahal Mori, in May, 1806. The invaders gained a complete victory, overran a large part of the hill country of Kangra, and kept up a constant warfare with the Rajput chieftains who still retained the remainder. The people fled as refugees to the plains, while the minor princes aggravated the general disorder by acts of anarchy on their own account. The horrors of the Gurkha invasion still burn in the memories of the people. The country ran with blood, not a blade of cultivation was to be seen, and grass grew and tigers whelped in the streets of the deserted towns. At length, after three years of anarchy, Sans\u0101r Chand determined to invoke the assistance of the Sikhs. Ranjit Singh, always ready to seize upon every opportunity for aggression, entered Kangra and gave battle to the Gurkhas in August, 1809. After a long and furious contest, the Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was successful, and the Gurkhas abandoned their conquests beyond the Sutlej. Ranjit Singh at first guaranteed to Sans\u0101r Chand the possession of all his dominions except the fort of Kangra and 66 villages, allotted for the support of the garrison; but he gradually made encroachments upon all the hill chieftains. Sans\u0101r Chand died in 1824, an obsequious tributary of Lahore. His son, Anrudh Chand, succeeded him, but after a reign of four years abandoned his throne, and retired to Hardw\u0101r, rather than submit to a demand from Ranjit Singh for the hand of his sister in marriage to a son of the Sikh minister Dhi\u0101n Singh. Immediately after Anrudh's flight in 1828, Ranjit Singh attached the whole of his territory, and the last portion of the once powerful Kangra State came finally into the possession of the Sikhs.\n\nKangra passed to the British at the end of the first Sikh War in 1846, but the commandant of the fort held out for some time on his own account. When the Mult\u0101n insurrection broke out in April, 1848, emissaries from the plains incited the hill chieftains to revolt; and at the end of August in the same year, R\u0101m Singh, a Path\u0101nia Rajput,\ncollected a band of adventurers and threw himself into the fort of Sh\u0101hpur. Shortly afterwards, the Katoch chief rebelled in the eastern extremity of the District, and was soon followed by the R\u0101j\u0101s of Jasw\u0101n and Dat\u0101pur, and the Sikh priest, Bedi Bikram\u0101 Singh. The revolt, however, was speedily suppressed; and after the victory of Gujr\u0101t, the insurgent chiefs received sentence of banishment to Almor\u0101, while Kangra subsided quietly into a British District. After the outbreak of the Mutiny in 1857, some disturbances took place in the Kul\u016b subdivision; but the vigorous measures of precaution adopted by the local authorities, and the summary execution of the six ringleaders and imprisonment of others on the occasion of the first overt act of rebellion, effectually subdued any tendency to lawlessness. The disarming of the native troops in the forts of Kangra and Nurpur was effected quietly and without opposition. Nothing has since occurred to disturb the peace of the District.\n\nFew Districts are richer in antiquities than Kangra. The inscription at Pathy\u0101r is assigned to the third century B.C., and that at Kanhi\u0101ra to the second century A.D. It is impossible to fix the date of the famous fort at Kangra Town. A temple in it was plundered by Mahm\u016bd of Ghazni in 1009, and an imperfectly legible rock-inscription, formerly outside one of the gates of the fort and now in the Lahore Museum, is assigned to a period at least 400 years earlier. The small temple of Indreswara at Kangra dates from about the ninth century. The beautiful shrine of Baijn\u0101th at Kiragr\u0101ma was formerly attributed to the same period, but recent investigations point to a date three or four centuries later. The present temple of Bajreswari Devi at Bhawan, a suburb of Kangra, is a modern structure, but it conceals the remains of an earlier building, supposed to date from 1440. It has acquired a repute, to which it is not entitled, as the successor of the temple that was sacked by Mahm\u016bd. Remains found at Kangra prove that it was once a considerable Jain centre. The fort at Nurpur, built in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, contains a curious wooden temple; and in 1886 a temple of much earlier date, with sculptures unlike anything hitherto found in the Punjab, was unearthed. At Masrur, in the Dehra tahsil, are some rock-temples of uncertain date. In the Kul\u016b valley, the principal objects of antiquarian interest are the temples of Bajaura. One of them, probably the older of the two, has been partially freed from the d\u00e9bris and boulders in which it was buried. The other, which shows traces of Buddhist workmanship, and dates from the eleventh century, is decorated with carvings of great beauty. The fort and temples of Kangra town received irreparable damage in the earthquake of 1905.\n\nThe population of the District at the last four enumerations was:\n(1868) 743,882, (1881) 730,845, (1891) 763,030, and (1901) 768,124, dwelling in 3 towns and 715 villages. It is divided into the seven tahsils of K\u0101ngra, N\u016brpur, Ham\u012brpur, Dera Gopipur, P\u0101lampur, Kul\u016b, and Sar\u0101j; of which the first five are in K\u0101ngra proper, the two last forming the Kul\u016b subdivision. The head-quarters of these are at the places from which each is named, except in the case of Kul\u016b and Sar\u0101j, whose head-quarters are at Sultanpur and Banj\u0101r respectively. The towns are the municipalities of Dharm\u015bala, the head-quarters of the District, K\u0101ngra, and N\u016brpur.\n\nThe following table shows the chief statistics of population in 1901:\n\n| Tahsil       | Area in square miles | Number of Towns | Villages | Population | Population per square mile | Percentage of increase or decrease between 1891 and 1901 | Number able to read and write |\n|--------------|----------------------|-----------------|----------|------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| K\u0101ngra       | 429                  | 2               | 134      | 126,335    | 294\u00b75                     | + 1\u00b70                                                  | 7,242                           |\n| P\u0101lampur     | 443                  | ...             | 113      | 132,955    | 300\u00b71                     | + 2\u00b76                                                  | 7,177                           |\n| Kul\u016b and Sar\u0101j | 1,342              | ...             | 68       | 119,585    | 89\u00b71                      | + 3\u00b78                                                  | 3,183                           |\n| Ham\u012brpur     | 601                  | ...             | 64       | 161,424    | 268\u00b76                     | - 0\u00b78                                                  | 6,077                           |\n| Dera Gopipur | 516                  | ...             | 145      | 125,530    | 243\u00b73                     | ...                                                    | 6,397                           |\n| N\u016brpur       | 525                  | 1               | 191      | 102,289    | 194\u00b78                     | - 2\u00b76                                                  | 4,241                           |\n| District total | 9,978              | 3               | 715      | 768,124    | 76\u00b79                      | + 0\u00b76                                                  | 34,617                          |\n\nNote.\u2014The figures for the areas of tahsils are taken from revenue returns. The total District area is that given in the Census Report.\n\n* These figures are taken from the Census Report of 1901, but the correct number of villages is now 714, the number for the Kul\u016b and Sar\u0101j tahsils being 67.\n\nIn K\u0101ngra proper Hindus number 608,252, or 94 per cent. of the total; Muhammadans, 38,685, or 6 per cent.; and Sikhs, 1,190. Owing to the vast tracts of uncultivable hill-side, the density of the population is only 77 persons per square mile, varying from 300 in the P\u0101lampur tahsil to 65\u00b74 in Kul\u016b; but if the cultivated area alone be considered, the density is 834, almost the highest in the Province. The people speak a great variety of dialects of the group of languages classed together as Pah\u0101r\u012b, or the language of the hills.\n\nThe distinguishing feature in the population is the enormous preponderance of the Hindu over the Muhammadan element, the latter being represented only by isolated colonies of immigrants, while the mass of the people have preserved their ancient faith in a manner wholly unknown in the plains. This circumstance lends a peculiar interest to the study of the Hindu tribes\u2014their castes, divisions, and customs.\n\nThe Br\u0101hmans (109,000) number nearly one-seventh of the total population. Almost without exception, they profess themselves to belong to the great Saraswat family, but recognize an infinity of internal\nsubdivisions. The first distinction to be drawn is that between Br\u0101hmans who follow, and Br\u0101hmans who abstain from, agriculture. Those who have restricted themselves to the legitimate pursuits of the caste are considered to be pure Br\u0101hmans; while the others are no longer held in the same reverence by the people at large.\n\nThe R\u0101jputs number even more than the Br\u0101hmans, 154,000 people returning this honourable name. The Katoch R\u0101j\u0101s boast the bluest blood in India, and their prejudices and caste restrictions are those of a thousand years ago. The Katoch clan is a small one, numbering only 4,000. The R\u0101this (51,000) constitute the higher of the two great agricultural classes of the valley, and are found chiefly in the N\u016brpur and Ham\u012brpur tahs\u012bls. The other is the Ghirths (120,000), who are S\u016bdras by status. In all level and irrigated tracts, wherever the soil is fertile and produce exuberant, the Ghirths abound; while in the poorer uplands, where the crops are scanty and the soil demands severe labour to compensate the husbandman, the R\u0101this predominate. It is as rare to find a R\u0101thi in the valleys as to meet a Ghirth in the more secluded hills. Each class holds possession of its peculiar domain, and the different habits and associations created by the different localities have impressed upon each caste a peculiar physiognomy and character. The R\u0101this generally are a robust and handsome race; their features are regular and well-defined, their colour usually fair, and their limbs athletic, as if exercised and invigorated by the stubborn soil upon which their lot is thrown. On the other hand, the Ghirth is dark and coarse-featured, his body is stunted and sickly, and goitre is fearfully prevalent among his race. The R\u0101this are attentive and careful agriculturists; their women take little or no part in the labours of the field. The Ghirths predominate in the valleys of P\u0101lam, K\u0101ngra, and Rihlu. They are found again in the Hal D\u016bn or Haripur valley, and are scattered elsewhere in every part of the District, generally possessing the richest lands and the most open spots in the hills. They are a most hard-working race.\n\nAmong the religious orders in the hills, the most remarkable are the Gosains (1,000), who are found principally in the neighbourhood of N\u0101daun and Jaw\u0101la Mukhi, but are also scattered in small numbers throughout the District. Many of them are capitalists and traders in the hills, and they are an enterprising and sagacious tribe. By the rules of their caste retail trade is interdicted, and their dealings are exclusively wholesale. Thus they possess almost a monopoly of the trade in opium, which they buy up in Kul\u016b and carry down to the plains of the Punjab. They speculate also in charas, shawl-wool, and cloth. Their transactions extend as far as Hyder\u0101b\u0101d in the Deccan, and, indeed, over the whole of India.\n\nAmong the hill tribes the most prominent are the Gaddis (9,000).\nSome have wandered down into the valleys which skirt the base of the Dhaola Dh\u0101r, but the great majority live on the heights above. They are found from an elevation of 3,500 or 4,000 feet up to 7,000 feet, above which altitude there is little or no cultivation. They preserve a tradition of descent from refugees from the Punjab plains, stating that their ancestors fled from the open country to escape the horrors of the Musalm\u0101n invasions, and took refuge in these ranges, which were at that period almost uninhabited. The term Gaddi is a generic name, under which are included Br\u0101hmans and Khattris, with a few R\u0101jputs, R\u0101this, and Th\u0101kurs. The majority, however, are Khattris. Besides the Gosains, the commercial castes are the Khattris (7,000) and S\u00fcds (6,000). Of the menial castes, the Cham\u0101rs (leather-workers) are the most numerous (57,000). About 77 per cent. of the population are returned as agricultural.\n\nThe Church Missionary Society has a station at K\u0101ngra town, founded in 1854, with a branch establishment at Dharm\u015b\u0101la; and there is also a station of the Moravian Mission at Kyelang in L\u0101hul, founded in 1857, and one of the American United Presbyterian Mission in Sar\u0101j. The District in 1901 contained 203 native Christians.\n\nIn the K\u0101ngra ta\u1e25s\u012bl the subsoil rests on beds of large boulders which have been washed down from the main ranges, and the upper stratum, consisting of disintegrated granite mixed with detritus from later formations, is exceedingly fertile. In the neighbourhood of the secondary ranges the soil, though of excellent quality, is less rich, being composed of stiff marls mixed with sand, which form a light fertile mould, easily broken up and free from stones. A third variety of soil is found wherever the Tertiary formation appears: it is a cold reddish clay of small fertility, containing a quality of loose water-worn pebbles: there are few trees in this soil, and its products are limited to gram and the poorer kinds of pulse, while in the first two descriptions the hill-sides are well forested and every kind of crop can be grown. The cultivated area is divided into fields generally unenclosed, but in some parts surrounded by hedges or stone walls. In the K\u0101ngra valley, where rice cultivation prevails, the fields descend in successive terraces levelled and embanked, and where the slope of the land is rapid they are often no bigger than a billiard table; in the west of the Dera and N\u016brpur ta\u1e25s\u012bls, where the country is less broken, the fields are larger in size, and the broad sloping fields, red soil, and thick green hedges are charmingly suggestive of a Devonshire landscape. In many parts, and notably in the K\u0101ngra valley, wide areas bear a double harvest.\n\nIn Kul\u016b proper the elevation is the chief factor in determining the nature of the crops sown, few villages lying as low as 3,000 feet and some as high as 9,000. In both K\u0101ngra and Kul\u016b proper the sowing\ntime varies with the elevation, the spring crop being sown from September to December and the autumn crop from April to July. The whole of L\u0101hul and Spiti is covered with snow from December to the end of April, and sowings begin as soon as the land is clear. For the District as a whole the autumn crop is the more important, occupying 53 per cent. of the area cropped in 1903-4.\n\nThe land is held, not as in the plains by more or less organized village communities, but by individual holders whose rights originated in a grant by a R\u0101j\u0101 of a right of tenancy in the royal domains. In Kul\u016b only forest and cultivable and cultivated lands have been measured, amounting to 1,342 square miles.\n\nThe area for which details are available from the revenue records of 1903-4 is 3,857 square miles, as shown below:\n\n| Tahsil     | Total | Cultivated | Irrigated | Cultivable waste | Forests.* |\n|------------|-------|------------|-----------|------------------|-----------|\n| Kangra     | 429   | 102        | 53        | 37               | 264       |\n| P\u0101lampur   | 443   | 125        | 62        | 52               | 239       |\n| Kul\u016b       | 1,054 | 67         | 14        | 12               | 903       |\n| Sar\u0101j      | 289   | 58         | 2         | 12               | 206       |\n| Hamirpur   | 602   | 234        | 5         | 101              | 295       |\n| Dera Gcipur| 515   | 167        | 26        | 121              | 136       |\n| N\u016brpur     | 525   | 170        | 22        | 72               | 208       |\n| **Total**  | **3,857** | **923**    | **184**   | **407**          | **2,221** |\n\n* The revenue returns include only a portion of the forest area.\n\nWheat is the chief crop of the spring harvest, covering 342 square miles; barley covered 97 square miles, and gram only 42. Maize and rice are the mainstay of the autumn harvest, covering 223 and 164 square miles respectively. Pulses covered 100 square miles. Of the millets, mandal, Italian millet, and china are the most important. There were 6,039 acres under cotton. The tea industry is an important one in Kangra, 15 square miles being under tea. There are 34 gardens owned by Europeans, and the total output is estimated at over a million pounds of tea annually. Potatoes, introduced shortly after annexation, are now largely cultivated in the higher hills; and the fields round the Gaddi peasants\u2019 houses, which formerly produced maize, wheat, or barley hardly sufficient to feed the families which owned them, now yield a very lucrative harvest of potatoes. In Kul\u016b proper poppy is an important crop, covering 2,102 acres. The climate of Kul\u016b is eminently suited for the production of all kinds of European fruits and vegetables, and several European planters do a large trade in pears and apples. In L\u0101hul barley, wheat, peas, and buckwheat are the principal crops, and in Spiti barley.\n\nThis was written before the earthquake of 1905, which had disastrous effects on the tea industry.\nThe chief improvements in agriculture have been the introduction of tea and the potato. The cultivated area increased by about 5 per cent. during the ten years ending 1900, owing to the efforts of individuals who have broken up waste land near their holdings; but there is no scope for any considerable increase. Loans from Government are not greatly in demand, the total amount advanced under the Agriculturists' Loans Act during the five years ending 1903-4 being only Rs. 208.\n\nThe indigenous breed of cattle is small but strong, and attempts to improve it by the importation of bulls from Hissar have not been satisfactory, the latter being quite unsuited to the climate, and unfitted to mate with the small hill cows. A few bulls of the Dhanni breed have recently been imported from Jhelum District, and it is hoped that they will prove more suitable. The G\u016bjars are the only people who make a trade of selling milk and ghi, and who keep herds of buffaloes: of these, some have a fixed abode in the District and pasture their cattle in the adjoining waste, while others move with their herds, spending the summer on the high ranges, and the winter in the woody parts of the low hills. Buffalo herds are not allowed to enter the Kul\u016b subdivision. The cattle of L\u0101hul are a cross between the Tibetan yak and the Himalayan breed of cattle. Sheep and goats form in Kangra proper the chief support of the pastoral tribe of the Gaddis, who move with their flocks, wintering in the forests in the low hills, retreating in the spring before the heat up the sides of the snowy range, and crossing and getting behind it to avoid the heavy rains in the summer. Large flocks are also kept in the Kul\u016b and Sar\u0101j tahsils. There are few ponies in the District and not many mules; the ponies of Kangra and Kul\u016b proper are poor, but those of L\u0101hul and Spiti are known for their hardiness and sureness of foot. One pony stallion is maintained by the District board.\n\nOf the total area cultivated in 1903-4, 184 square miles, or nearly 20 per cent., were classed as irrigated. Irrigation is effected entirely by means of channels from the hill streams which lead the water along the hill-sides, often by tortuous channels constructed and maintained with considerable difficulty, and distribute it over the fields. One of these cuts, from the Gaj stream, attains almost the dimensions of a canal, and the channels from the Be\u0101s are also important. Most of these works were engineered by the people themselves, and supply only the fields of the villages by which they were constructed; but a few, for the most part constructed by the R\u0101j\u0101s, water wider areas, and an organized staff for their maintenance is kept up by the people without any assistance from Government. In L\u0101hul and Spiti cultivation is impossible without irrigation, and glacier streams are the chief source.\nThe forests are of great importance, comprising little short of a quarter of the uncultivated area. Under the Forest department are\n\nForests. 87 square miles of 'reserved,' 2,809 of protected, and 296 of unclassed forests, divided into the two Forest divisions of Kangra and Kul\u016b, each under a Deputy-Conservator.\n\nAbout 4 square miles of unclassed forests are under the Deputy-Commissioner. Several varieties of bamboo cover the lower hills, the bamboo forests occupying an area of 14,000 acres. The produce exported from the Government forests in Kangra proper is mainly chil (Pinus longifolia) and bamboo, while deodar is the chief product of Kul\u016b. In 1903-4 the forest revenue was 2-8 lakhs.\n\nValuable metal ores are known to exist both in Kangra proper and in Kul\u016b; but, owing chiefly to the want of means of carriage, of fuel, and of labour, they are practically unworked. Iron was smelted for some years in the Kangra hills, and in 1882 there were eight mines yielding 90 maunds of iron a year; but working ceased entirely in 1897. Ores of lead, copper, and antimony have been found, and in Kul\u016b silver and crystal, while gold in small quantities is sometimes washed from the sands of the Be\u0101s and P\u0101rbati; coal, or rather lignite, is also produced, but in insignificant quantities. A lease of the old Shigri mines in L\u0101hul has recently been granted for the purpose of working stibnite and galena. With this exception, the only minerals at present worked are slates and sandstone for building; the Kangra Valley Slate Company sells 700,000 slates annually, and three other quarries produce together about 83,000, the total value exceeding Rs. 50,000. Several hot mineral springs near Jaw\u0101la Mukhi are impregnated with iodide of potassium and common salt. Hot springs occur at several places in Kul\u016b, the most important being at Manikarn in the P\u0101rbati valley, and at Bashist near the source of the Be\u0101s.\n\nThe District possesses no factories except for the manufacture of tea, and there are but few hand industries. The cotton woven in the villages holds its own against the competition of European stuffs, but the industry is seriously handicapped by the small quantity of cotton grown locally. N\u016brpur used to be a seat of the manufacture of pashmina shawls, but the industry has long been declining; silver ornaments and tinsel printed cloths are made at Kangra. Baskets are made in the villages of Kangra proper and Kul\u016b, and blankets in Kul\u016b, L\u0101hul, and Spiti.\n\nThe principal exports to the plains consist of rice, tea, potatoes, spices, opium, blankets, pashmina, wool, gh\u012b, honey, and beeswax, in return for which are imported wheat, maize, gram and other pulses, cotton, tobacco, kerosene oil, and piece-goods. The chief centres of the Kangra trade in the plains are Hoshiarpur, Jullundur, Amritsar,\nand Path\u0101nkot. There is a considerable foreign trade with Lad\u0101kh and Y\u0101rkand through Sult\u0101npur in Kul\u016b, the exports being cotton piece-goods, indigo, skins, opium, metals, manufactured silk, sugar, and tea, and the imports ponies, borax, charas, raw silk, and wool. The principal centres of internal trade are K\u0101ngra, P\u0101lampur, Suj\u0101npur T\u012bra, Jaw\u0101la Mukhi, and N\u016brpur.\n\nNo railway traverses the District, though one from Path\u0101nkot to P\u0101lampur was contemplated. The principal roads are the K\u0101ngra valley cart-road, which connects P\u0101lampur and Path\u0101nkot, with a branch to Dharm\u015b\u0101la, and the road from Dharm\u015b\u0101la, via K\u0101ngra, to Hoshi\u0101rpur and Jullundur. The former is partly metalled and a mail tonga runs daily. A road runs from P\u0101lampur to Sult\u0101npur in Kul\u016b over the Dulchi pass (7,000 feet), which is open summer and winter, going on to Simla. Another road runs through Kul\u016b, and, crossing the Rohtang pass (13,000 feet) into L\u0101hul, forms the main route to Leh and Y\u0101rkand. Lad\u0101kh is reached from L\u0101hul over the B\u0101r\u0101 L\u0101cha (16,250 feet). The usual route to Spiti is through L\u0101hul and over the Kan-zam pass. The total length of metalled roads is 56 miles, and of unmetalled roads 1,073 miles. Of these, all the metalled and 353 miles of the unmetalled roads are under the Public Works department, and the rest under the District board.\n\nFamine is unknown, the abundance of the rainfall always assuring a sufficient harvest for the wants of the people, and the District was classed by the Irrigation Commission of 1903 as secure. The area of crops matured in the famine year 1899-1900 amounted to 69 per cent. of the normal.\n\nThe District is in charge of a Deputy-Commissioner, aided by three Assistant or Extra-Assistant Commissioners, of whom one is in charge of the Kul\u016b subdivision and one in charge of the District treasury. K\u0101ngra proper is divided into the five tahsils of K\u0101ngra, N\u016brpur, Ham\u012brpur, Dera Gopipur, and P\u0101lampur, each under a tahsild\u0101r and a naib-tahsild\u0101r; the Kul\u016b Subdivision, consisting of the Kul\u016b tahsil under a tahsild\u0101r and a naib-tahsild\u0101r, the Sar\u0101j tahsil under a naib-tahsild\u0101r; and the mountainous tracts of L\u0101hul and Spiti, which are administered by local officials termed respectively the th\u0101kur and nono. The th\u0101kur of L\u0101hul has the powers of a second-class magistrate and can decide small civil suits; the nono of Spiti deals with all classes of criminal cases, but can punish only with fine. The criminal administration of Spiti is conducted under the Spiti Regulation I of 1873. Two officers of the Forest department are stationed in the District.\n\nThe Deputy-Commissioner as District Magistrate is responsible for the criminal justice of the District, under the supervision of the Sessions Judge of the Hoshi\u0101rpur Sessions Division. The subdivisional officer\nof Kul\u016b hears appeals from the tahsild\u0101r of Kul\u016b, the naib-tahsild\u0101r of Saraj, the th\u0101kur of L\u0101hul, and the nono of Spiti. Civil judicial work in Kangra proper is under a District Judge, under the Divisional Judge of the Hoshiarpur Civil Division. In Kul\u016b the subdivisional officer generally exercises the powers of a District Judge, and the Deputy-Commissioner of Kangra, if a senior official, is appointed Divisional Judge of Kul\u016b. The only Munsif sits at Kangra, while there are seven honorary magistrates, including the R\u0101j\u0101s of Lamb\u0101graon, N\u0101daun, and Kutlehr in Kangra proper. The District is remarkably free from serious crime. Civil suits are chiefly brought to settle questions of inheritance involving the rights inter se of widows, daughters, and distant agnatic relatives.\n\nThe revenue history and conditions differ radically from those of the Punjab proper. The hill states, now combined in Kangra District, were merely a number of independent manors. Each R\u0101j\u0101 enjoyed full proprietary rights, and was a landlord in the ordinary sense of the word, leasing his land at will to individual tenants on separate pattas or leases. This fact explains the two prominent characteristics of the revenue system, its variety and its continuity. Just as, on the one hand, the intimate local knowledge of the R\u0101j\u0101 and his agent enabled them to impose a rent fixed or fluctuating, in cash or kind, according to the resources and the needs of each estate, so, on the other hand, the conquerors, Mughal and Sikh, imposed their tribute on the several R\u0101j\u0101s, leaving them to devise the source and the method of collection. The Mughals, it is true, reserved certain areas as imperial demesnes, and here they introduced chauthris who were responsible both for the collection of the revenue and for the continued cultivation of the soil. They made no change, however, either in assessments or in methods of collection. The R\u0101j\u0101s depended on their land-agents (called variously k\u0101rd\u0101r, h\u0101kim, amin, or palsara), and these in turn had under them the kotw\u0101ls, who were responsible for eight or ten villages apiece. The village accountant, or k\u0101y\u0101t, the keeper of the granary (kotiala), with constables, messengers, and forest watchers, made up the revenue staff. Every form of assessment was to be found, from the division of the actual produce on the threshing-floor to permanent cash assessments.\n\nRanjit Singh was the first to interfere with the R\u0101j\u0101s\u2019 system. He appointed a n\u0101zim, or governor of the hill territory, who managed not only the revenue, but the whole expenditure also. Under him were k\u0101rd\u0101rs, who either farmed the revenue of their parganas, or accepted a nominal salary and made what they could. The ancient system, however, has survived the misrule of the Sikhs. Every field in the valley is clearly defined; and the proportion of its produce payable to Government is so firmly established that, even under the present cash\nassessments, it forms the basis on which the land revenue is distributed among individual cultivators.\n\nThe first act of the British officers was to apply the village system of the plains to the Kangra valley. The tenants, with their private cultivating rights, became the proprietary body, with joint revenue-paying responsibilities. The waste, formerly regarded as the property of the Rajas, became attached to the village communities as joint common land. The people thus gained the income arising from the common land, which had previously been claimed by the state.\n\nA summary settlement was made in 1846 by John Lawrence, Commissioner of the Jullundur Doab, and Lieutenant Lake, Assistant Commissioner, based entirely on the Sikh rent-roll with a reduction of 10 per cent. The first regular settlement, made in 1849, reduced the demand on 'dry' land by 12 per cent., maintaining the former assessment on 'wet' land. A revised settlement, made in 1866-71, had for its object the preparation of correct records-of-rights; but the assessment was not revised until 1889-94, when an increase of 10 per cent. was announced. Rates varied from Rs. 1-5-4 to R. 0-14-7 per acre. The total demand in 1903-4, including cesses, was about 10.7 lakhs. The average size of a proprietary holding is 2 acres. There are a number of large jagirs in the District, the chief of which are Lambagraon, Nadaun, and Dado Siba in Kangra proper, and waziri Rupi in Kul\u00fc.\n\nA system of forced labour known as begar was in vogue in the Kangra hills until recently, and dates back from remote antiquity. All classes who cultivate the soil were bound to give, as a condition of the tenure, a portion of their labour for the exigencies of the state. Under former dynasties the people were regularly drafted and sent to work out their period of servitude wherever the ruler chose. So inveterate had the practice become that even artisans, and other classes unconnected with the soil, were obliged to devote a portion of their time to the public service. Under the British Government the custom was maintained for the conveyance of travellers' luggage and the supply of grass and wood for their camps, but was practically abolished in Kangra proper in 1884, and in Kul\u00fc in 1896.\n\nThe collections of land revenue alone and of total revenue are shown below, in thousands of rupees:\n\n|                | 1880-1 | 1890-1 | 1900-1 | 1903-4 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Land revenue   | 6,19   | 6,57   | 7,35   | 7,59   |\n| Total revenue  | 8,76   | 9,92   | 10,57  | 10,55  |\n\nThe District contains three municipalities, Dharamsala, Kangra, and Nurpur. Outside these, local affairs are managed by a District board, and by the local boards of Kangra, Nurpur, Dera Gopipur.\nHamirpur, and P\u0101lampur, the areas under which correspond with the tahsils of the same names. The chief source of their income is the local rate, a cess of Rs. 8-5 4 per cent. on the land revenue in K\u0101ngra, of Rs. 10-6-8 in Kul\u016b, and of Rs. 7-8-10 in the waziri of Spiti. The expenditure in 1903-4 was Rs. 1,45,000, public works being the principal item.\n\nThe District is divided into 15 police stations, 13 in K\u0101ngra proper and 2 in Kul\u016b; and the police force numbers 412 men, with 901 village watchmen. The Superintendent usually has three inspectors under him. The jail at head-quarters contains accommodation for 150 prisoners. It has, however, been condemned as unsafe, and a new one is in contemplation.\n\nK\u0101ngra stands seventh among the twenty-eight Districts of the Province in respect of the literacy of its population. In 1901 the proportion of literate persons was 4.5 per cent. (8.4 males and 0.3 females). The number of pupils under instruction was 2,591 in 1880-1, 3,881 in 1890-1, 3,341 in 1900-1, and 3,852 in 1903-4. In the last year the District contained 6 secondary and 57 primary (public) schools for boys and 9 for girls, and 3 advanced and 20 elementary (private) schools, with 266 girls in the public and 38 in the private schools. The principal educational institution is the high school at P\u0101lampur, founded in 1868, and maintained by the District board. There are 5 middle schools for boys, of which 2 are Anglo-vernacular; 3 of these are maintained by the District board and 2 are aided. The total expenditure on education in 1903-4 was Rs. 35,000, of which Rs. 7,000 was derived from fees, Rs. 4,000 from Government grants, and Rs. 2,000 from subscriptions and endowments. Municipalities contributed Rs. 4,000, and the balance was paid out of District funds.\n\nBesides the civil hospital at Dharm\u015b\u0101la, the District has 8 outlying dispensaries. In 1904, 739 in-patients and 101,159 out-patients were treated, and 1,769 operations were performed. The expenditure was Rs. 19,000, of which Rs. 14,000 was met from District and Rs. 3,000 from municipal funds.\n\nThe number of successful vaccinations in 1903-4 was 40,825, representing the high proportion of 53 per 1,000 of the population. Vaccination is compulsory in Dharm\u015b\u0101la.\n\n[H. A. Rose, *District Gazetteer of K\u0101ngra Proper* (1905); A. Anderson, *Settlement Report of K\u0101ngra Proper* (1897); A. H. Diack, *Gazetteer of Kul\u016b, L\u0101hul, and Spiti* (1897), *The Kul\u016b Dialect of Hindi* (1896), and *Settlement Report of Kul\u016b Subdivision* (1898).]\n\n**K\u0101ngra Tahsil.** \u2014 Tahsil of K\u0101ngra District, Punjab, lying between 31\u00b0 54' and 32\u00b0 23' N. and 76\u00b0 8' and 76\u00b0 41' E., with an area of 429 square miles. The tahsil lies entirely in the hills, between the Dhaola Dh\u0101r, which separates it from Chamba on the north, and the\nK\u0101lidh\u0101r hills on the south. The B\u0101ngang\u0101 and Gaj flow through it in a south-westerly direction to join the Be\u0101s. The main range of the Dhaola Dh\u0101r and its spurs are in many places covered with forest. The population in 1901 was 126,335, compared with 125,138 in 1891. It contains the towns of Dharm\u015b\u0101la (population, 6,971) and K\u0101ngra (4,746), the head-quarters; and 134 villages, of which Kanhi\u0101ra and Ch\u0101ri are of archaeological interest. The land revenue and cesses in 1903-4 amounted to 2 lakhs.\n\nK\u0101ngra Town (Vagarkot\u00b9 or Kot K\u0101ngra). Town in K\u0101ngra District, Punjab, formerly the head-quarters of the District and still the head-quarters of the K\u0101ngra tahsil, situated in 30\u00b0 5' N. and 76\u00b0 16' E. Population (1901), 4,746. Lying on the northern slope of the low ranges which run through the centre of the District, it faces Dharm\u015b\u0101la and commands a fine view of the K\u0101ngra valley. In its lower suburb (called Bhawan) was the temple of Devi Bajreshri, whose gilded cupola was, until the earthquake of 1905, a conspicuous landmark, and which contained a late Sanskrit inscription of about 1430 dedicated to Jaw\u0101la Mukhi and mentioning Sans\u0101r Chand I., the Katoch king of K\u0101ngra. On the lofty ridge south of and above the town stood Kot K\u0101ngra or 'the fort,' surrounded on three sides by inaccessible cliffs. In its highest part were the dwellings and temples of the old Katoch kings of K\u0101ngra. The town, with the fort and temples, was destroyed by the earthquake of April 4, 1905, in which 1,339 lives were lost in the town. Seven Europeans were among the killed.\n\nK\u0101ngra has from time immemorial been a stronghold of the Katoch R\u0101j\u0101s. Firishta, in his introductory chapter narrating the exploits of a former king of Kanauj, who overran the hills from Kumaun to Kashmir, subduing 500 petty chiefs, distinctly alludes to the R\u0101j\u0101 of Nagarkot. The riches of the temple attracted the attention of Mahm\u016bd of Ghazni, who in 1009 took the fort and plundered the temple, carrying off, it is said, 700,000 golden din\u0101rs, 700 mans of gold and silver plate, 200 mans of pure gold in ingots, 2,000 mans of unwrought silver, and 20 mans of jewels, including pearls, corals, diamonds, and rubies. The temple plundered by Mahmud was probably situated within the fort and was not the temple of Devi in Bhawan, as has been supposed. Thirty-five years later the place is said to have been recaptured after a siege of four months by the Hindu princes under the R\u0101j\u0101 of Delhi. K\u0101ngra submitted to Firoz Sh\u0101h in 1360, who again plundered the temple; and in 1388 prince Mahm\u016bd Tughlak, when a fugitive from Delhi, found an asylum here till called to the throne in 1390. K\u0101ngra was permanently garrisoned under the Mughals, and should have passed to Ahmad Shah Durr\u0101ni in the\n\n\u00b9 Nagarkot appears to have been the name of the town and K\u0101ngra of the fort.\ncession of 1752; but the governor, Saif Ali Khan, refused to surrender it, and maintained himself in the fort for twenty years. After his death in 1774, Sansar Chand, Raja of Kangra, laid siege to the fort and, being unable to reduce it, called in the Sikh leader Jai Singh, Kanbaya, to whom, and not to the Raja, it surrendered. Jai Singh, however, withdrew in 1785, and Sansar Chand possessed himself of the fort. Kangra was besieged from 1806 to 1809 by the Gurkhas, who were only repelled by the aid of Ranjit Singh. In return for his services the Maharaja appropriated for himself the fort, which was held by the Sikhs when the Jullundur Doab was ceded to the British in 1846. The governor refusing to surrender, the fort was invested and capitulated after a two months' siege. The head-quarters of the District were first fixed at Kangra, but were transferred to Dharamsala in 1855.\n\nThe temple of Devi above mentioned was one of the most ancient and famous shrines in Northern India, and was largely resorted to by pilgrims from the plains at the great festivals held in March, April, and October. The municipality was created in 1867. The income during the ten years ending 1902-3 averaged Rs. 5,500, and the expenditure Rs. 5,300. In 1903-4 the income was Rs. 5,600, chiefly derived from octroi: and the expenditure was Rs. 6,500. Its position on the Kangra valley cart-road makes it an important centre of internal trade. The chief educational institution is an Anglo-veracular middle school maintained by the Church Missionary Society, which has a station here. There is a Government dispensary.\n\nKangundi Tahsil.\u2014Zamindari tahsil in the south-west corner of North Arcot District, Madras, lying between 12\u00b0 35' and 12\u00b0 56' N. and 78\u00b0 14' and 78\u00b0 35' E., with an area of 347 square miles. It comprises the Kangundi zamindari. The head-quarters are now the village of Kuppam, which is also the residence of the zamindar; but the tahsil gets its name from the village of Kangundi, which was formerly the chief town in this part of the country. The population rose from 54,052 in 1891 to 64,446 in 1901, the increase during the decade (19 per cent.) being the highest in any portion of the District. The increase was largely due to the existence of several gold-mines, a continuation of those in the adjoining Kolur Gold Fields, in the part which borders on Mysore State. The number of villages is 268. The peshkash (including cesses) payable to Government in 1903-4 amounted to Rs. 29,500.\n\nKangundi Village. Village in the zamindari tahsil of the same name in North Arcot District, Madras, situated in 12\u00b0 46' N. and 78\u00b0 27' E. Population (1901), 637. It was once the chief place in the neighbourhood and the residence of the zamindar of Kangundi, but has been depopulated by fever and famine. It lies at the base\nof a precipitous hill, crowned with the ruins of a fort which must have been a place of great strength. The zamindar's old palace is also an imposing pile.\n\nK\u0101nheri Caves.\u2014Caves in Th\u0101na District, Bombay, situated in a wild picturesque valley in the heart of the island of Salsette, in $19\u00b0\\ 13' N.$ and $72\u00b0\\ 59' E.$, about 6 miles from Th\u0101na. They may be reached from the Bh\u0101ndup station of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, or from the Borivli station of the Bombay, Baroda, and Central India Railway. The name Kanhagiri, perhaps a Pr\u0101krit corruption of the Sanskrit Krishnagiri or 'Krishna's hill,' seems to show that the same and holiness of K\u0101nheri date from before the rise of Buddhism. From the simple style of some of them, and an inscription in the caves at N\u0101sik, it is presumed that they date from $100$ B.C. to A.D. $50$. Additions both of fresh caves and of new ornaments in old caves seem to have been made in the fourth, fifth, and sixth centuries A.D. The caves consist of numerous dwellings and some chaityas or relic shrines. In all, there are upwards of a hundred excavations. Except the chaityas and the peculiarly planned cave known as the Darb\u0101r cave, they have stone sleeping benches running round the walls. There are some fifty-four inscriptions, which have been partly deciphered and relate the names of the builders. The cathedral or large chaitya cave is the most important of the group. In front of it were once two or three relic mounds, of which the largest was built of stone and brick and was from $12$ to $16$ feet high. The Darb\u0101r cave or 'place of assembly' is the next largest, and is distinguished by two long low seats or benches running down the whole length of the centre.\n\n[For a full description of the K\u0101nheri caves, see Bombay Gazetteer, vol. xiv, pp. 121-95.]\n\nKanhi\u0101ra.\u2014Village in the District and tahsil of K\u0101ngra, Punjab, situated in $32\u00b0\\ 12' N.$ and $76\u00b0\\ 24' E.$, 4 miles east of Dharm\u015b\u0101la. Population (1901), 3,446. The name is a corruption of Krishna-yashas-\u0101r\u0101ma, according to Cunningham, or possibly Krishna-vih\u0101ra. An inscription cut on two massive granite blocks in the Brahmi and Kharoshthi scripts found here would appear to prove the existence of a Buddhist monastery (\u0101r\u0101ma) at this place in the second century A.D. Slate is quarried at and round the village. Kanhi\u0101ra suffered seriously from the earthquake of April 4, 1905.\n\n[Archaeological Survey Reports, vol. v, p. 177; and Epigraphia Indica, vol. vii, p. 116.]\n\nKani.\u2014Northernmost township of the Lower Chindwin District, Upper Burma, lying on both sides of the Chindwin river, between $22\u00b0\\ 2' and 22\u00b0\\ 56' N.$ and $94\u00b0\\ 16' and 95\u00b0\\ 5' E.$, with an area of $1,788$ square miles. The population was $41,232$ in 1891, and $48,717$ in 1901, distributed in $256$ villages, Kani (population, $1,097$).\n40 miles above Monywa, on the right bank of the Chindwin, being the head-quarters. A large portion of the township consists of 'reserved' forests, and the whole is hilly and well watered. Cultivation is confined to the narrow valleys in that portion lying west of the Chindwin, and to the flatter part east of the river. The area cultivated in 1903-4 was 32 square miles, and the land revenue and thathameda amounted to Rs. 1,11,000.\n\nKanigiri Taluk.\u2014Taluk of Nellore District, Madras, lying between 15\u00b0 1' and 15\u00b0 35' N. and 79\u00b0 5' and 79\u00b0 41' E., with an area of 1,014 square miles. It is bounded on the south by the Udayagiri taluk, and on the east for some distance by the Malakonda range of hills. The population, which was 131,222 in 1891, had fallen in 1901 to 110,813, a succession of bad seasons having caused large numbers to emigrate. The demand on account of land revenue and cesses in 1903-4 amounted to Rs. 65,000. The taluk contains one town, Kanigiri (population, 5,528), the head-quarters; and 188 villages. Only 34 of the latter belong to Government, and 22 are shrotriems, interspersed among the more numerous zamindari villages of the Kalahasti and Venkatagiri Estates. The head-quarters, formerly at Mogallur, a zamindari village, were removed to Kanigiri in 1879. Besides the taluk office, there is a District Munsif's court at this place. The general aspect of the country is forbidding. Treeless plains of red sand stretch in all directions. At Kanigiri there is a block of rocky hills. In the north-western corner near Nandanavanam some remarkable sandhills from 29 to 30 feet in height spread over a considerable area. They are probably formed of detritus from the neighbouring hills drifted by the force of the fierce land-wind. Wells are fairly numerous. The Paleru, the Manneru, and their affluents, rising among the ranges of hills to the west, drain the taluk. Ragi and cambu are the staple food-crops. Aruga is also grown and is preferred to the others as a food. Rice is imported. Education is backward, and not a few villages are to be found where the village accountant is the only person who can read and write. The taluk is wanting in facilities for irrigation. There are a few tanks, of which nine belong to Government, but none of them commands any considerable area. Various irrigation projects are under consideration, and the Hajipuram project, to impound the freshes of the Dommaleru, is in progress.\n\nKanigiri Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the taluk of the same name in Nellore District, Madras, situated in 15\u00b0 25' N. and 79\u00b0 31' E. Population (1901), 5,528. The town has a large market, to which cotton goods and iron are imported from Madras, chillies and tobacco from Kistna, and sundry articles from the Ceded Districts. Spinning instruments, razors, and scissors are manufactured and largely exported: the slippers made here are considered superior to those in other parts\nof the District: and the granite of the Kanigiri hill supplies excellent building stone. This hill rises to a considerable height on the north of the town, forming a feature in the landscape for many miles round. On it is a rugged table-land about a square mile in area, where a town is said to have once stood. It is supposed to have been fortified by one of the Gajapatis of Orissa and designated Kanakagiri Vijayam\u0101rtanda Durgam, combining the name of the hill with that of the deity to whom a temple on it was dedicated. The remains of some of the defences still stand. The place was taken in the sixteenth century by Krishna Deva of Vijayanagar, and played a conspicuous part in local feuds until it was destroyed by Haidar Ali.\n\n**Kanjamalai.**\u2014Hill in the District and taluk of Salem, Madras, situated in 11\u00b0 37' N. and 78\u00b0 4' E., and 3,238 feet in height. It is a conspicuous object in the Salem landscape, with its hog-backed shape and its serrated ridges, and is widely known for its rich stores of magnetic iron ore. There are five separate beds of this, and the supply is almost inexhaustible. It often contains as much as 40 per cent. of iron. Vast quantities of the ore of these beds have rolled down the sides of the hill, especially to the south, where not only does the extensive talus consist mainly of it, but the fields for one or two miles from the hill are thickly strewn with rolled fragments of all sizes. The Kanjamalai iron was the source of supply of the ill-fated Porto Novo Iron Company, which erected blast furnaces at Porto Novo in the early years of the nineteenth century, but eventually collapsed. Since then no mining has been done here. Two firms hold licences to prospect in the hill, but no definite steps have yet been taken to extract any ore. At the foot of the hill is the famous temple of Siddharkovil.\n\n**Kanjarda.**\u2014Petty State in K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r, Bombay.\n\n**K\u0101nk\u0101nhalli Taluk.**\u2014Southern taluk of Bangalore District, Mysore, lying between 12\u00b0 15' and 12\u00b0 49' N. and 77\u00b0 14' and 77\u00b0 38' E., with an area of 623 square miles. The population rose from 71,868 in 1891 to 83,557 in 1901. The taluk contains one town, K\u0101nk\u0101nhalli (population, 5,588), the head-quarters; and 252 villages. The land revenue demand in 1903\u20134 was Rs. 1,02,000. The Ark\u0101vati enters the taluk on the north-west, and flows into the Cauvery, which forms the southern boundary. The south is occupied by high hills and forests, with extensive grazing-grounds. R\u0101gi, avare, and castor-oil are the chief crops of the open parts. Tamarinds, coco-nuts, and mulberry are grown along the streams. The soils are generally shallow and rocky.\n\n**K\u0101nk\u0101nhalli Town.**\u2014Head quarters of the taluk of the same name in Bangalore District, Mysore, situated on the Ark\u0101vati river, in 12\u00b0 33' N. and 77\u00b0 26' E., 36 miles south of Bangalore city. Population (1901), 5,588. The fort was built by Jagadeva R\u0101ya of Channa\npatna about 1577, and taken by the Mysore troops in 1630. Tipu twice destroyed the town to prevent its giving shelter to the British army marching on Seringapatam. The name is properly K\u0101nak\u0101ranahalli, the village of the K\u0101nak\u0101ra or 'landed proprietor.' To this family in 1648 was granted Channar\u0101yapatna (Hassan District). The municipality dates from 1870. The receipts and expenditure during the ten years ending 1901 averaged Rs. 1,800 and Rs. 1,900. In 1903\u20134 they were Rs. 2,200 and Rs. 2,300.\n\nK\u0101nker.\u2014Feudatory State in the Central Provinces, lying between 20\u00b0 6' and 20\u00b0 34' N. and 80\u00b0 41' and 81\u00b0 48' E., with an area of 1,429 square miles. It is bounded on the north by Drug and Raipur Districts; on the east by Raipur; on the south by the State of Bastar; and on the west by Ch\u0101nda. The head-quarters are at K\u0101nker, a village with 3,906 inhabitants, situated on a small stream called the Dudh, 39 miles by road from Dhamtari station on the Raipur-Dhamtari branch of the Bengal-Nagpur Railway. Most of the State consists of hill and forest country; and except in the eastern portion along the valley of the Mah\u0101n\u0101di there are no extensive tracts of plain land, while the soil of the valley itself is interspersed with outcrops of rock and scattered boulders. The Mah\u0101n\u0101di enters K\u0101nker at a short distance from its source, and flows through the eastern part of the State, receiving the waters of numerous small streams from the hills. Gneiss of a granitoid character is the prevailing rock formation. The principal forest trees are teak, sal (Shorea robusta), sirs\u0101 (Dalbergia latifolia), and bij\u0101s\u0101l (Pterocarpus Marsupium). The ruling chief belongs to a very old R\u0101jput family, and according to tradition his ancestors were raised to the throne by a vote of the people. During the supremacy of the Haihaiwansi dynasty of Chhattisgarh, the chief of K\u0101nker is shown in an old record as in subsidiary alliance with the ruling power, and as having held the Dhamtari tract within their territories. Under the Mar\u0101th\u0101s the K\u0101nker State was held on condition of furnishing a military contingent 500 strong whenever required. In 1809 the chief was deprived of K\u0101nker, but was restored to it in 1818 by the British Resident administering the Nagpur territories, on payment of a tribute of Rs. 500. This was remitted in 1823 on the resumption by the Government of certain manorial dues, and since then no tribute has been paid. The present chief, L\u0101l Kamal Deo, was installed in 1904. The population in 1901 was 103,536, having increased by 26 per cent. during the previous decade. Gonds form more than half the total, and there are also a number of Halb\u0101s. Chhattisgarhi and Gondi are the languages spoken.\n\nThe soil is for the most part light and sandy. Nearly 300 square miles, or 21 per cent. of the total area, were occupied for cultivation in 1904, and 284 square miles were actually under crop. Rice covers\nnearly 130 square miles and K\u0101nkrej 32. The cultivated area has increased largely in recent years. There are 21 tanks which irrigate about 350 acres. The recent opening of a branch line to Dhamtari has brought the considerable forests of the State within reach of the railway, and a large income is obtained from sales of timber. About 333 square miles are tree forest. The State contains 51 miles of metalled and 75 miles of unmetalled roads: the principal metalled road is from Dhamtari to K\u0101nkrej.\n\nThe total revenue in 1904 was Rs. 1,56,000, the principal heads of receipt being land revenue (Rs. 67,000), forests (Rs. 60,000), and excise (Rs. 20,000). The incidence of land revenue is less than 4 annas per acre of cropped area. The principal items of expenditure were Rs. 45,000 for the maintenance of the ruling family, Rs. 13,000 on general administration, Rs. 8,300 on police, Rs. 4,200 on education, and Rs. 3,400 on land revenue settlement. During twelve years since 1892-3 a total of Rs. 1,14,000 has been expended on public works, under the supervision of the Engineer of the Chhattisgarh States division. Besides the roads already mentioned, an office building, jail, schools, post office, and sarai or native travellers' resthouse have been constructed at K\u0101nkrej. The State supports one vernacular middle and 16 primary schools, with a total of 1,316 pupils. Only 904 persons were returned as able to read and write in 1901, the proportion of male literates being 1\u00b77 per cent. of the population. A dispensary is maintained at K\u0101nkrej. A Political Agent under the supervision of the Commissioner, Chhattisgarh Division, controls the relations of the State with Government.\n\nK\u0101nkrej (or Thara).\u2014A collection of petty estates under the P\u0101lanpur Agency, Bombay, with a total area of 810 square miles. They are bounded on the north by P\u0101lanpur; on the east by a subdivision of Baroda territory; on the south by R\u0101dhanpur State; and on the west by the P\u0101lanpur estates of Diod\u0101r. The population in 1901 was 38,829, compared with 38,842 in 1891. The first connexion of the British Government with the States of K\u0101nkrej dates from the formation in 1819-20 of the Mahi K\u0101nth\u0101 Agency, in which they were included till 1844, when, on account of their nearness to P\u0101lanpur, they were transferred to the P\u0101lanpur Agency. K\u0101nkrej comprises 26 different estates, the chief of which are Thara, Un, and Kamboi, most of them held by R\u0101jputs who have intermarried with Koh women. The largest and most important estate is Thara, whose chiefs are V\u0101ghela Kolis by caste: and these, by refusing to eat with their brethren, have been allowed to intermarry with R\u0101jput houses, and are now generally admitted as belonging to the R\u0101jput tribe. The principal village in K\u0101nkrej is Thara, 5 miles north of which is K\u0101kar, the ancient capital of the State, with some ruined temples.\nK\u0101nkrol\u012b.\u2014Chief town of an estate of the same name in the State of Udaipur, R\u0101jput\u0101na, situated in $25^\\circ 4' N.$ and $73^\\circ 53' E.$, about 36 miles north-by-north-east of Udaipur city. The town contains (1901) 3,053 inhabitants, and is the head-quarters of a Gosain who is a descendant of Vallabh\u0101ch\u0101rya. The estate, which consists of 21 villages situated in different parts of Mew\u0101r, is held by him as a mu\u0101fi or free grant from the Mah\u0101r\u0101n\u0101. To the north of the town lies the R\u0101j Samand, a fine sheet of water 3 miles long by $1\\frac{1}{2}$ miles broad, with an area of about 3 square miles. The lake is formed by a dam built at the south-western end by R\u0101n\u0101 R\u0101j Singh between 1662 and 1676. Its construction served to alleviate the sufferings of a starving population, and it is the oldest known famine relief work in R\u0101jput\u0101na. It is said to have cost about 70 lakhs. The dam forms an irregular segment of a circle nearly 3 miles long; the northern portion, which lies between two hills, is about 200 yards long and 70 yards broad, and is entirely faced with white marble from the adjacent quarries. Along the front, a flight of steps descends to the water\u2019s edge, while jutting out into the lake are three marble pavilions, all richly sculptured in different patterns. At one end of the embankment is the temple of Dv\u0101rka Dh\u012bsh, one of the seven forms of Krishna; and the image now worshipped there is said to be the identical one brought to R\u0101jput\u0101na in 1669 by the descendants of Vallabh\u0101ch\u0101rya when they left Muttra from fear of Aurangzeb. On a hill to the north-east are the remains of a large Jain temple, said to have been built by R\u0101n\u0101 R\u0101j Singh\u2019s minister, Day\u0101l S\u0101h. Its spire was partly destroyed by the Mar\u0101th\u0101s and replaced by a round tower, but it is still a picturesque ruin.\n\n[J. Fergusson, *Picturesque Illustrations of Ancient Architecture* (1841).]\n\nKanksi\u0101li.\u2014Petty State in K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r, Bombay.\n\nKannad.\u2014North-western t\u0101luk of Aurang\u0101b\u0101d District, Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State, with an area of 769 square miles. The population in 1901, including j\u0101girs, was 88,901, compared with 82,887 in 1891. The t\u0101luk contains 236 villages, of which 68 are j\u0101gir, and Kannad (population, 3,609) is the head-quarters. The land revenue in 1901 was 1.9 lakhs. From the Gaot\u0101la hill, 7 miles north of Kannad, the Gaot\u0101la gh\u0101t descends into Kh\u0101ndesh. The Contingent troops, sent in pursuit of the Bhils in 1830, were encamped on this hill for six months.\n\nK\u0101nor.\u2014Chief town of an estate of the same name in the State of Udaipur, R\u0101jput\u0101na, situated in $24^\\circ 26' N.$ and $74^\\circ 16' E.$, about 38 miles east-by-south-east of Udaipur city. Population (1901), 4,300. The K\u0101nor estate, which consists of 110 villages, is held by one of the first class nobles of Mew\u0101r, who is termed R\u0101wat and belongs to the S\u0101rangdevot family of the Sesodia R\u0101jputs. The income is about Rs. 32,000, and a tribute of Rs. 2,500 is paid to the Darb\u0101r.\nKanora.\u2014Petty State in Rew\u0101 K\u0101nth\u0101, Bombay.\n\nKanp\u0101r Ishwaria.\u2014Petty State in K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r, Bombay.\n\nK\u0101npur.\u2014Principal village in Narsinghpur, one of the Orissa Tributary States, Bengal, situated in $26^\\circ 24' \\text{N.}$ and $85^\\circ 11' \\text{E.}$, on the Mah\u0101n\u0101di. Population (1901), 1,727. K\u0101npur has a bi-weekly market, and a trade in grain, cotton, oilseeds, and sugar-cane.\n\nK\u0101ntanagar.\u2014Village in the Th\u0101kurgaon subdivision of Din\u0101jpur District, Eastern Bengal and Assam, situated in $25^\\circ 48' \\text{N.}$ and $88^\\circ 39' \\text{E.}$. It is the site of a fine eighteenth-century Hindu temple to K\u0101ntaji (Vishnu), the family god of the R\u0101j\u0101 of Din\u0101jpur. The foundation was laid in 1704, but the finest portion was not completed till 1772; the temple was badly damaged in the earthquake of 1897. The place is much resorted to, and an annual fair is held here at the time of the R\u0101sh festival in October\u2013November.\n\n[Martin, Eastern India, vol. ii, p. 628.]\n\nK\u0101nth.\u2014Town in the Amroha tahsil of Mor\u0101d\u0101b\u0101d District, United Provinces, situated in $29^\\circ 3' \\text{N.}$ and $78^\\circ 37' \\text{E.}$, 17 miles north west of Mor\u0101d\u0101b\u0101d city. Population (1901), 7,092. The town contains a branch of the American Methodist Mission. It is administered under Act XX of 1856, with an income of about Rs. 1,600. There is a small local industry in cotton cloth and sugar. The middle school has 146 pupils.\n\nK\u0101nth\u0101ria.\u2014Petty State in K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r, Bombay.\n\nK\u0101nthi.\u2014Subdivision and village in Midnapore District, Bengal.

Population (1901), 4,719. It is situated on the Cuttack Sonpur road, and is 7 miles from the R\u0101j\u0101's residence. It is a considerable seat of trade, but has somewhat declined in importance since the opening of the Bengal-N\u0101gpur Railway. The manufacture of brass-ware is largely carried on.\n\nK\u0101nu.\u2014Village in Burdw\u0101n District, Bengal. See Kh\u0101na.\n\nKapadvanj Taluka.\u2014Northern taluka of Kaira District, Bombay, lying between $22^\\circ 52' \\text{and } 23^\\circ 7' \\text{N.}$ and $72^\\circ 50' \\text{and } 73^\\circ 19' \\text{E.}$, with an area of 279 square miles. The taluka is in shape an oblong, 15 miles long and 30 miles broad, and contains one town, Kapadvanj (population, 15,405), the head-quarters, and 87 villages. The population in 1901 was 75,258, compared with 101,527 in 1891. The density is only 270 persons per square mile, the District average\nbeing 449. The land revenue and cesses in 1903-4 amounted to 1.8 lakhs. Towards the south and west, Kapadvanj is a rich and well-cultivated plain clothed with trees. The Mohar and the V\u0101trak flow through it, but these streams are of little use for irrigation, being highly charged with soda. The water-supply generally is scanty. B\u0101jra, rice, jow\u0101r, and maize are the staple crops.\n\nKapadvanj Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the t\u0101luka of the same name in Kaira District, Bombay, situated in 23\u00b0 1' N. and 73\u00b0 5' E. Population (1901), 15,405. Near the walls, which protect the place, are the ruins of an ancient town, the scene of some hard-fought battles during the Mar\u0101th\u0101 ascendancy. It was exchanged for Bij\u0101pur in 1817. Kapadvanj derives its importance from lying on one of the main trade routes between Central India and the coast. The principal objects of interest in the town are a fine reservoir with a well in the centre, and an arch in the Ch\u0101lukya (1000-1300) style of architecture. A sacred pool, with traditional healing qualities, is inside the well. South of the pool is an underground temple of Mah\u0101deo, which was discovered in A.D. 1044, if popular tradition is to be relied on. The idol appears to have been placed underground to protect it from the iconoclastic zeal of early Musalm\u0101n invaders. Of modern buildings that of most note is a Jain temple, the interior of which is richly ornamented with marble pillars, and has a marble pavement inlaid with delicacy and taste. The municipality was established in 1863. The average receipts for the decade ending 1901 were Rs. 15,000; and the income in 1903-4 was Rs. 16,000, chiefly derived from a house and land tax. Precious stones, such as agate and onyx, are found in large quantities in the bed of the Mohar, a rocky stream half a mile north of the town. Manufactures are soap, glass, and leathern butter-jars. The most important article of trade is grain. Besides supplying a considerable local demand, Kapadvanj goods are exported to the P\u0101nch Mah\u0101ls, B\u0101lasinor territory, and Central India. The town contains a Sub-Judge's court, a dispensary, and 11 schools (9 for boys, including an English school with 52 pupils, and 2 for girls), which are attended by 804 and 258 pupils respectively.\n\nKapilavastu. The city where Buddha was born, and the ancient capital of the S\u0101kyas, from whose royal house he was descended. For many years it was believed that Kapilavastu was on the site now occupied by Bhul\u0101 D\u012bh in the Basti District of the United Provinces. A re-examination of the narratives of the Chinese pilgrims, and the identification of other sites, had already caused doubts as to the correctness of this view, when, in 1895, an inscription was found on a pillar at Nighv\u0101, in the Nep\u0101l tarai, 31 miles north-west of the Uska B\u0101z\u0101r railway station. This inscription recorded a visit by Asoka and repairs to the st\u016bpa of Kon\u0101g\u0101mana. The latter building is described\nin Buddhist literature as close to Kapilavastu, and it was therefore thought that the site had been definitely fixed. Further investigation showed, however, that no remains of the st\u016bpa existed in the neighbourhood, and that the pillar itself was not in its original position. In 1896 another pillar was found a mile north of the village of Paderia in Nep\u0101l, and two miles north of the Nep\u0101lese ta\u1e25sil station at Bhagw\u0101npur. An inscription showed that it had been raised by Asoka at the Lumbini garden to mark the birthplace of Buddha. The sacred books of the Buddhists state that Buddha was born at the Lumbini garden close to Kapilavastu, and the place is still called Rummin-dei, while a Hindu temple hard by contains a representation of the miraculous birth of Buddha. The pillar itself is split down the middle, thus agreeing with the statement of Hiuen Tsiang, who described it in the seventh century A.D., as having been struck by lightning. The neighbourhood, in which there are many mounds and remains of buildings, has not been fully explored, so that the exact site of Kapilavastu is not known, but it must be within a few miles of Paderia. The accounts of the Chinese pilgrims disagree; and it has been suggested that the sites shown to them were not the same, and that Fa Hian believed Kapilavastu to be represented by Piprahwa in Bast\u012b District, 9 miles southwest of Rummin-dei, while Hiuen Tsiang was taken to a different place, Tilaura Kot, 14 miles north-west of the garden. The locality was almost deserted when they visited it.\n\n[See Report on the Antiquities in the Tarai by the late P. C. Mukherji, with prefatory note by V. A. Smith (Calcutta, 1901).]\n\nKapili.\u2014River of Assam, which rises on the northern slopes of the Jainti\u0101 Hills, Eastern Bengal and Assam, and, after a course of 163 miles, falls into the K\u0101lang at J\u0101gi, near the western end of Nowgong District. It receives the Doi\u0101ng, which carries off the whole of the drainage of the extreme north of C\u0101ch\u0101r District, and, in addition to numerous other minor streams, the Jamun\u0101, Barp\u0101ni, and Umi\u0101m or Kiling. A branch channel connects it with the Kalang at Rah\u0101, 20 miles east of its main junction with that river. In the rainy season the Kapili is navigable by boats of 4 tons burden up to Pani-mur, the place at which it leaves the hills; but progress beyond this spot is checked by a barrier of rocks, over which the river is precipitated in a fine waterfall. During the dry season boats of this size cannot proceed farther than K\u0101mpur. In the hills the Kapili flows along a rocky channel; in the plains its course is through low-lying land, and its banks are for the most part covered with dense jungle grass. Most of the hill trade, which consists of cotton, lac, and eri silk, comes down the Kapili to Ch\u0101parmukh, and is dispatched thence by rail or country boat to Gauh\u0101ti. The Assam-Bengal Railway crosses the river on a brick bridge 500 yards in length, but this is largely in\nexcess of the actual breadth of the channel at most seasons of the year. The principal places on its banks are Ch\u0101parmukh, Jamun\u0101mukh, Kh\u0101rikh\u0101na, and Dharamtul. The floods of this river do considerable damage. Efforts have been made by the villagers to protect their lands, by constructing an embankment for about 7 miles along the southern bank from Deonarikoli to Magurgaon in the Sahari mauza.\n\nKapilmuni.\u2014Village in the head-quarters subdivision of Khuln\u0101 District, Bengal, situated in $22^\\circ 42' N.$ and $89^\\circ 19' E.$, on the Kabadak. Population (1901), 362. Kapilmuni is connected by steamer service with Jhingerg\u0101cha station on the Eastern Bengal State Railway, and possesses a bi-weekly market. A large annual fair, held in March in honour of the goddess Kapileswari, is attended by 6,000 or 7,000 persons.\n\nKapini.\u2014River in Mysore District, Mysore. See Kabbani.\n\nK\u0101psi.\u2014Estate in Kolh\u0101pur State, Bombay.\n\nKap\u016brthala State.\u2014Native State in the Punjab, under the political control of the Commissioner, Jullundur Division, lying between $31^\\circ 9'$ and $31^\\circ 44' N.$ and $75^\\circ 3'$ and $75^\\circ 59' E.$, with an area of 652 square miles. The population in 1901 was 314,341, giving an average density of 499 persons per square mile. The State consists of three detached pieces of territory, the principal of which is an irregular strip of country on the east bank of the Be\u0101s, varying in breadth from 7 to 20 miles, and measuring in all 510 square miles. It stretches from the borders of Hoshi\u0101rpur District on the north to the Sutlej on the south, while on the east it is bounded by Jullundur District. This portion of the State lies, for the most part, in the Be\u0101s lowlands, and is roughly bisected from north to south by the White or Western Bein. The Phagw\u0101ra tahsil, which measures 118 square miles, is enclosed by Jullundur District on all sides except the north-east, where it marches with Hoshi\u0101rpur. The rest of the territory consists of a small block of villages, known as the Bhunga il\u0101ka, which forms an island in Hoshi\u0101rpur District. Both these tracts lie in the great plain of the Do\u0101b, which contains some of the best land in the Province, and are traversed by the torrents which issue from the Siw\u0101liks, the most important of which, known as the Black or Eastern Bein, passes through the north of the Phagw\u0101ra tahsil. The State lies entirely in the alluvium, and the flora and fauna resemble those of the neighbouring Districts. The climate is generally good, except in the lowlands during the rainy season. The rainfall is heaviest in Bholath and lightest in the Sult\u0101npur tahsil. The average is much the same as in Jullundur.\n\nThese figures do not agree with the area given in Table III of the article on the Punjab, and in the table on p. 410 of this article, which is the area as returned in 1901, the year of the latest Census. They are taken from more recent returns. The density is taken from the Census Report of 1901.\nThe ancestors of the chief of Kap\u016brthala at one time held possessions both in the cis- and trans-Sutlej and also in the B\u0101ri Do\u0101b. In the latter lies the village of Ahl\u016b, whence the family springs, and from which it takes the name of Ahl\u016bw\u0101lia. The scattered possessions in the B\u0101ri Do\u0101b were gained by the sword in 1780, and were the first acquisitions made by Sard\u0101r Jassa Singh, the founder of the family. Of the cis-Sutlej possessions, some were conquered by Sard\u0101r Jassa Singh, and others were granted to him by Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Ranjit Singh prior to September, 1808. By a treaty made in 1809, the Sard\u0101r of Kap\u016brthala pledged himself to furnish supplies to British troops moving through or cantoned in his cis-Sutlej territory; and by declaration in 1809 he was bound to join the British standard with his followers during war. In 1826 the Sard\u0101r, Fateh Singh, fled to his cis-Sutlej territory for the protection of the British Government against the aggressions of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Ranjit Singh. This was accorded, but in the first Sikh War the Kap\u016brthala troops fought against the British at Aliw\u0101l; and, in consequence of these hostilities and of the failure of the chief, Sard\u0101r Nih\u0101l Singh, son of Sard\u0101r Fateh Singh, to furnish supplies from his estates south of the Sutlej to the British army, these estates were confiscated. When the Jullundur Do\u0101b came under the dominion of the British Government in 1846, the estates north of the Sutlej were maintained in the independent possession of the Ahl\u016bw\u0101lia chieftain, conditional on his paying a commutation in cash for the service engagements by which he had previously been bound to Ranjit Singh. The B\u0101ri Do\u0101b estates have been released to the head of the house in perpetuity, the civil and police jurisdiction remaining in the hands of the British authorities. In 1849 Sard\u0101r Nih\u0101l Singh was created a R\u0101j\u0101. He died in September, 1852, and was succeeded by his son, Randh\u012br Singh. During the Mutiny in 1857 the forces of Randh\u012br Singh, who never hesitated or wavered in his loyalty, strengthened our hold upon the Jullundur Do\u0101b; and afterwards, in 1858, the chief led a contingent to Oudh which did good service in the field. He was well rewarded; and among other concessions obtained the grant in perpetuity of the estates of Baundi and Ikaun\u0101 (in Bahraich District) and Bhitauli (in B\u0101ra Banki District) in Oudh, which have an area of 700 square miles, and yield at present a gross revenue of about 13\u00b75 lakhs. Of this, 3\u00b74 lakhs is paid to Government as land revenue and cesses. In these estates the R\u0101j\u0101 exercises no ruling powers, though in Oudh he is, to mark his superiority over the ordinary t\u0101lukd\u0101rs, addressed as R\u0101j\u0101-i-R\u0101jag\u0101n. This title was made applicable to the R\u0101j\u0101 in Oudh only, and not in the Punjab. R\u0101j\u0101 Randh\u012br Singh died in 1870, and was succeeded by his son, R\u0101j\u0101 Kharrak Singh. The present R\u0101j\u0101, Jagatjit Singh, son of Kharrak Singh, succeeded in September, 1877, attaining his majority.\nin 1890. The chiefs of Kap\u016brthala are Sikhs. Sard\u0101r Jassa Singh was always known as Jassa Kal\u0101l; but the family claim descent from R\u0101n\u0101 Kap\u016br, a semi-mythical member of the R\u0101jput house of Jaisalmer, who is said to have left his home and founded Kap\u016brthala 900 years ago. The R\u0101j\u0101 has the right of adoption and is entitled to a salute of 11 guns.\n\nSult\u0101npur is built on a very ancient site, but the only architectural remains of interest are two bridges and a sarai. The sarai and one of the bridges are attributed to Jah\u0101ng\u012br, while the other bridge is said to have been built by Aurangzeb. The two princes, D\u0101r\u0101 Shikoh and Aurangzeb, are said to have lived for some time in the sarai and to have received instruction there from Akhund Abdul Lat\u012bf, an inhabitant of the place.\n\nThe State contains 603 villages and three towns: Kap\u016brthala, Sult\u0101npur, and Phagw\u0101ra. There are five tahsils: namely, Kap\u016brthala, Dhilw\u0101n, Bholath, Phagw\u0101ra, and Sult\u0101npur, each with its head-quarters at the place from which it is named. The population at the last three enumerations was: (1881) 252,617, (1891) 299,690, and (1901) 314,351.\n\nThe main statistics of population in 1901 are given in the following table:\n\n| Tahsil     | Area in square miles | Number of Towns | Villages | Population | Population per square mile | Percentage of variation in population between 1891 and 1901 | Number of persons able to read and write |\n|------------|----------------------|-----------------|----------|------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Kap\u016brthala | 121                  | 1               | 110      | 57,314     | 474                       | + 8.2                                                        | 2,708                                  |\n| Dhilw\u0101n    | 110                  | ...             | 103      | 48,985     | 444                       | + 4.1                                                        | 1,202                                  |\n| Bholath    | 127                  | ...             | 126      | 62,270     | 490                       | + 0.7                                                        | 1,971                                  |\n| Phagw\u0101ra   | 118                  | 1               | 88       | 69,837     | 592                       | + 9.2                                                        | 2,846                                  |\n| Sult\u0101npur  | 176                  | 1               | 176      | 75,945     | 432                       | + 1.0                                                        | 1,904                                  |\n| State total| 630                  | 3               | 603      | 314,351    | 499                       | + 4.6                                                        | 10,631                                 |\n\nNote.\u2014The figures for the areas of tahsils are taken from revenue returns. The total State area is that given in the Census Report.\n\nAbout 57 per cent. of the population are Muhammadans, 30 per cent. Hindus, and only 13 per cent. Sikhs. The percentage of Muhammadans is considerably higher than in the neighbouring Districts and States. In density of population Kap\u016brthala stands first among the Punjab States and is surpassed by only five of the British Districts. Punjabi is the language of practically all the inhabitants. Among the Muhammadans the most numerous castes are Arains (51,000), Rajputs (24,000), and Jats (14,000). Among Hindus, Jats number 15,000, and Br\u0101hmans 10,000, while the principal menial castes are Ch\u016bhr\u0101s (sweepers, 21,000) and Cham\u0101rs (leather-workers, 12,000). Sikhs are most numerous among the Jats (20,000) and the Kambobhs (12,000). Nearly 68 per cent. of the population are dependent on agriculture.\nThe proportion is higher than in any Punjab District in the plains except Hissar, and is slightly above the average for the States of the Province. Most of the trade is in the hands of Khattris, who number 7,000. Christians number only 39; there is no mission in the State.\n\nThe greater portion of the Sult\u0101npur, Dhilw\u0101n, and Bholath tahsils lies in the lowlands (Bet) of the Be\u0101s. Wells are used to irrigate the lands in the Bet, except in years of excessive floods. In the sandy tracts known as the Dona there are irrigation wells. There are a few strips of land where the soil is too saline for cultivation. The Kap\u016brthala tahsil, as it includes only a small portion of the Bet, is the least fertile, and most of it lies in the Dona tracts. There are many wells in the tahsil, but owing to the insufficiency of rainfall and the nature of the soil, the area irrigated by each well is small. The other portions of the State are fertile, and receive ample irrigation either from hill torrents or from wells.\n\nThe main statistics of cultivation in 1903\u20134 are shown in the following table, in square miles:\n\n| Tahsil     | Total area | Cultivated | Irrigated | Cultivable waste |\n|------------|------------|------------|-----------|-----------------|\n| Kap\u016brthala | 121        | 92         | 12        | 16              |\n| Dhilw\u0101n    | 110        | 55         | 17        | 17              |\n| Bholath    | 127        | 78         | 21        | 10              |\n| Phagw\u0101ra   | 118        | 69         | 18        | 26              |\n| Sult\u0101npur  | 176        | 110        | 19        | 55              |\n| **Total**  | **652**    | **404**    | **87**    | **124**         |\n\nThe tenures of the State present no peculiarities. A few villages are owned by the R\u0101ja, but most are held by agricultural communities. The staple agricultural products, with the area in square miles under each in 1903\u20134, are as follows: wheat (200), gram (59), maize (47), cotton (9), and sugar-cane (15).\n\nThe system of State advances to agriculturists was established in 1876 by Mr. (now Sir C.) Rivaz, the Superintendent of the State, and the total amount advanced during the ten years ending 1903\u20134 was Rs. 2,13,000.\n\nThe cattle bred locally are of an inferior type and the best animals are imported. Efforts are being made to improve the local breed, and a number of Hissar bulls have been introduced. The horses, like those in other parts of the Jullundur Do\u0101b, are small; but six stallions, the property of the State, are located at convenient centres, with the object of improving the breed. Mule-breeding has recently been introduced, and the State maintains 6 donkey stallions. A horse and cattle fair is held every year at Kap\u016brthala town.\nThe area irrigated in 1903\u20134 from wells was 87 square miles; that inundated from the overflow of the Beas and the Western Bein was 68 square miles. In the lowlands, the only kharif crops that can be grown are sugar-cane and rice. In the rabi harvest, the wheat and gram are usually excellent. The floods from the hill torrents are often held up by dams and spread over the fields for the irrigation of sugar-cane, rice, &c., by means of small channels. Sometimes the water is raised by means of jhalars, worked in the same way as Persian wheels. In most parts of the State the wells are masonry, but along the rivers or hill torrents unbricked wells are dug for temporary use, especially in seasons of drought. In a year of light rainfall, such as 1899\u20131900, the area watered by wells may rise as high as 109 square miles. The area irrigated by a single masonry well varies from 5 acres in the sandy tracts of the Kapurthala tahsil to 7 acres in the Bet. The total number of masonry wells in 1903\u20134 was 9,394.\n\nThere are five \u2018reserved\u2019 forests in the State, covering an area of about 42 square miles. They are kept chiefly as game preserves, and no revenue is derived from them. The grass growing in them is used as fodder for the transport mules, State horses, and elephants.\n\nThe State lies wholly in the alluvium, and the only mineral product of importance is kankar, which merely supplies local requirements.\n\nSultanpur is famous for hand-painted cloths, which are made up into quilts, bed-sheets, jazams (floorcloth), curtains, &c., and in the form of jazams, curtains, and tablecloths are exported to Europe. Phagwara is noted for its metal-work.\n\nTrade and communications. The State exports wheat, cotton, tobacco, and sugar in large quantities. Phagwara has a large and increasing trade in grain; and as the grain market is free from octroi, it has attracted a good deal of the trade which formerly went to Jullundur and Ludhiana.\n\nThe main line of the North-Western Railway passes through the Phagwara, Kapurthala, and Dhilwan tahsils, but Phagwara is the only town on the railway. The grand trunk road runs parallel to the railway and at a short distance from it. It is maintained by the British Government. The total length of the metalled roads maintained by the State is about 25 miles, and of unmetalled roads 35 miles. The most important metalled roads are those connecting the capital with the railway at Kartarpur (7 miles) and at Jullundur (11 miles). The State maintains half of each of these roads. The British Post Office system extends to the State, which has no concern with the postal income or expenditure.\n\nCash rents prevail, and they are fixed according to the quality of the area leased. The rates vary from a minimum of 6 annas per acre for unirrigated land in the Kapurthala tahsil to a maximum of Rs. 9 per acre for land supplied by wells in the same tahsil.\nTradition still keeps alive the memory of the famines of 1866 and 1865, when relief measures were undertaken by the State. The famine in 1899-1900 was less severe, but on that occasion also the sufferers were relieved by the distribution of grain and of Rs. 1,323 in cash, though it was not found necessary to start relief works.\n\nThe Commissioner of the Jullundur Division is the Agent to the Lieutenant-Governor for Kap\u016brthala. The R\u0101j\u0101 has full powers. The State pays Rs. 1,31,000 as tribute to the British Government. The chief secretary (Mushir-i-Azam) deals with all papers pertaining to State affairs, which are to be laid before the R\u0101j\u0101 for orders, and conducts all correspondence with Government. He is also associated with the two other officials forming the State Council in carrying out the central administration under His Highness's control. For the purpose of general local administration the State is divided into five tahs\u012bls\u2014Kap\u016brthala, Dhilw\u0101n, Bholath, Phagw\u0101ra, and Sult\u0101npur.\n\nThe Indian Penal Code and the Procedure Codes are in force in the State, with certain modifications. Legislative measures are prepared by the State Council for the sanction of the R\u0101j\u0101. The main provisions of the Punjab Revenue Law are also generally followed in the State.\n\nEach tahsil is in charge of a tahsild\u0101r, who is invested with powers to dispose of rent, revenue, and civil cases up to the limit of Rs. 300, and also exercises magisterial powers corresponding to those of a second-class magistrate in British Districts. The appeals in rent and revenue cases (judicial and executive side) against the orders of the tahsild\u0101rs are heard by the Collector, who also decides cases (revenue and judicial) exceeding Rs. 300. There is a Revenue Judicial Assistant who disposes of cases (revenue and judicial) exceeding Rs. 300 in the two tahs\u012bls of Dhilw\u0101n and Bholath. He also hears appeals against the orders of the tahsild\u0101rs in those tahs\u012bls. Appeals against the orders of the Collector and the Revenue Judicial Assistant are preferred to the Mushir-i-M\u0101l, whose orders are appealed to the State Council, which is the final appellate court in the State. Appeals in civil and criminal suits against the orders of the tahsild\u0101rs are heard by the magistrate exercising the powers of a District Magistrate. He is assisted as a court of original jurisdiction by an assistant magistrate having the powers of a first-class magistrate. Appeals against the orders of the magistrate and assistant magistrate lie in the appellate court of the Civil and Criminal Judge, appeals from whose decisions are heard by the State Council. In murder cases the R\u0101j\u0101 passes sentence of death or imprisonment for life.\n\nThe old system under which the revenue was realized in kind was\nnot done away with until 1865. The share of the State was two-fifths of the entire produce. On some crops, such as sugar-cane, &c., the State used to take its share in money. The revenue was actually collected by the State officials in kind, and stored up in the State granary and sold as required.\n\nThe land revenue at the date of British annexation of the Punjab was 5\u00b77 lakhs. In 1865 the first settlement of the State was completed, and the demand was fixed at 7 lakhs. In 1877, during the minority of the present R\u0101j\u0101, the assessment was revised, and the demand raised to 7\u00b77 lakhs. A further revision took place in 1900, when the revenue was raised to 8\u00b77 lakhs. On this occasion the work was carried out entirely by the State officials. During the settlement of 1865, the first revenue survey was undertaken. It was completed in 1868. The rates for unirrigated land vary from 8 annas to Rs. 4 per acre, and for irrigated land from Rs. 3 to Rs. 9 per acre. The average rate for unirrigated land is Rs. 2\u20137, and for irrigated land Rs. 6\u20138 per acre.\n\nTwo of the State preserves, with an area of 2,200 acres, have been brought under cultivation. Occupancy rights in the greater part of one of these areas have been given to the cultivators on payment of a nazar\u0101na at the rates of Rs. 30, Rs. 37\u20138, or Rs. 45 per acre, according to the quality of the soil; while the remaining portion is given out to tenants-at-will on payment of a nazar\u0101na of Rs. 15 per acre. The total nazar\u0101na realized in 1903\u20134 from the tenants was Rs. 76,000.\n\nThe following table shows the revenue of the State in recent years, in thousands of rupees:\n\n|                | 1880-1 | 1890-1 | 1900-1 | 1903-4 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Land revenue   | 7\u00b738   | 7\u00b733   | 7\u00b765   | 8\u00b739   |\n| Total revenue  | 19\u00b708  | 21\u00b745  | 24\u00b738  | 27\u00b717  |\n\nApart from land revenue, the main items of income in 1903\u20134 were: Oudh estates (10\u00b77 lakhs), stamps (2\u00b73 lakhs), cesses (1\u00b77 lakhs), and jagirs in the Districts of Lahore and Amritsar (0\u00b74 lakh). The total expenditure in 1903\u20134 was 27\u00b78 lakhs. The main items were: civil service, including tribute (7\u00b77 lakhs), household (6\u00b74), Oudh estates (5\u00b74), public works (4\u00b79), and army (1\u00b79).\n\nSpirit is distilled by licensed contractors in the State distillery. The rights of manufacture and vend are sold by public auction. A fixed charge of Rs. 25 is levied from each contractor for the use of the distillery, and a still-head duty of Rs. 4 per gallon is imposed on all spirit removed for sale. The receipts in 1903\u20134 were Rs. 21,000. M\u0101lw\u0101 opium is obtained by the State from the British Government at the reduced duty of Rs. 280 per chest, up to a maximum of 8 chests annually. The duty so paid is refunded, with the object of securing\nthe co-operation of the State officials in the suppression of smuggling. The opium is retailed to the contractors at the rates prevalent in the neighbouring British Districts. Licences for the sale of hemp drugs are auctioned. Charas is imported from the Punjab and bhang from the United Provinces. The profit on opium and drugs in 1903-4 amounted to Rs. 11,000.\n\nThe towns of Kapurthala and Phagwara have been constituted municipalities. The nomination of the members requires the sanction of the Raja. The municipality of Kapurthala was established in 1896 and that of Phagwara in 1904. There is a local rate committee for the State, which was established in 1901-2, and is presided over by the Mushir-i-Mul. The income in 1903-4 was Rs. 15,000, derived mainly from a rate of Rs. 1-9 per cent. on the land revenue. The expenditure is devoted to unmetalled roads and other works of utility for the villages.\n\nThe Public Works department was first organized in 1860, and is under the charge of the State Engineer. The principal public works are the State offices, infantry and cavalry barracks, the college, hospitals, Villa Buona Vista, the great temple, and the Victoria sarai. The State offices cost 4-9 lakhs. A new palace is under construction.\n\nThe State maintains a battalion of Imperial Service Infantry at a cost of 1-2 lakhs; and the local troops consist of 66 cavalry, 248 infantry, 21 gunners with 8 serviceable guns, and a mounted body-guard of 20.\n\nThe police force, which is under the control of the Inspector-General, includes 3 inspectors, 1 court inspector, 5 deputy-inspectors, 15 sergeants, and 272 constables. The village chaukidars number 243. There are six police stations, one in charge of an inspector and five in charge of deputy-inspectors. Besides the police stations, there are fifteen outposts. The jail at Kapurthala has accommodation for 105 prisoners. Jail industries include carpet and dari making.\n\nThree per cent. of the population (5 males and 0-3 females) were returned as literate in 1901. The proportion is lower than in the adjoining British Districts and the States of Nabha and Faridkot, but higher than in Patiala and Jind. The number of pupils under instruction was 1,815 in 1880-1, 1,762 in 1890-1, 2,265 in 1900-1, and 2,547 in 1903-4. In the last year there were 27 primary and 5 secondary schools, and an Arts college at Kapurthala. The number of girls in the schools was 205. All the primary and secondary schools, except those situated in the capital, are controlled by the director of public instruction, but the principal of the college is responsible for the schools at the capital. The course of instruction is the same as in British territory. The total expenditure on education in 1903-4 was Rs. 28,000.\n\nThe three hospitals in the State (the Randhir Hospital, the Victoria Jubilee Female Hospital, and the Military Hospital) contain accommo\ndation for 51 in-patients. There are also 4 dispensaries. In 1903 the number of cases treated was 71,642, of whom 984 were in-patients, and 1,991 operations were performed. The hospitals and dispensaries are in charge of the Chief Medical Officer. In 1904 the total number of persons successfully vaccinated was 5,739, or 18.2 per 1,000 of the population.

Griffin, The Rajas of the Punjab (second edition, 1873).]\n\nKapurthala Tahsil.\u2014Tahsil of the Kapurthala State, Punjab, lying between 31\u00b0 22' and 31\u00b0 35' N. and 75\u00b0 17' and 75\u00b0 35' E., with an area of 121 square miles. The population increased from 52,968 in 1891 to 57,314 in 1901. It contains one town, Kapurthala (population, 18,519), and 110 villages. The land revenue and cesses in 1903-4 amounted to 1.7 lakhs. The tahsil is the least fertile in the State. Only a small portion of it lies in the Beas lowlands; and the rest consists of a sandy plain beyond the reach of the floods, where the cultivation depends on irrigation from wells.\n\nKapurthala Town.\u2014Capital of the Kapurthala State, Punjab, situated in 31\u00b0 23' N. and 75\u00b0 25' E., 8 miles east of the Beas, and 11 from Jullundur. Population (1901), 18,519. It is said to have been founded in the eleventh century by Rana Kapur of the Rajput ruling family of Jaisalmer, from whom the present Raja of Kapurthala claims descent. In 1780 it was wrested by Sardar Jassa Singh from the Muhammadan chieftain who had seized the town and its dependent villages on the break-up of the Mughal empire, and has since been the capital of the State. It contains the Raja's palace and many other handsome edifices. The town is administered as a municipality, the income of which in 1903-4 was Rs. 13,000, chiefly derived from octroi, and the expenditure Rs. 18,000. It possesses the Randhir College, a high school, a girls' school, and a hospital.\n\nKar\u0101.\u2014Place of historic interest in Allahabad District, United Provinces.\n", "source": "olmocr",
