A carman in the prosecutor's employ was proceeding along the High-street with a load of coals, when his attention was directed to the prisoner and another boy who were on the van, at the rear, putting some of the coal into a sack. The prisoner's companion got away, and the prisoner, when asked by the carman what he had in the sack, replied, \"Nothing of yours.\" Asked to be allowed to see what it contained, he threw the sack down and ran away. He was caught, and handed over to Constable Tabb, 472 K. At the police-station he admitted the offence. The officer informed the magistrate that the prisoner was the leader of a gang of young thieves who infested the High-street, and that it was impossible for a policeman in uniform to catch them, for they kept such a sharp watch, and did nothing in the way of robbery until out of sight. The prisoner had been charged with stealing coal before, and was then fined. On that occasion he said they sold it where they could, and that if it was not purchased they threw it into the river. The magistrate committed the accused to prison for fourteen days' with hard labour.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3200810316.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 1752, "total-output-tokens": 375, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 1433, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
