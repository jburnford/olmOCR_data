She was returning home about eleven o'clock on the same night, and while passing along the Horse-guards parade, in St. James's-park, she was accosted by the prisoner, who seized her by the throat, made a snatch at her watch, which was attached to a guard-chain round her neck, and the chain breaking the prisoner obtained possession of the watch, and immediately knocked her down and then ran away, pursued by an intelligent lad named Colling, who had witnessed the robbery. The screams of the prosecutrix attracted a police constable named Wood, who found her lying on the ground. He raised her up, and then went in pursuit of her assailant, who in the meantime however had been taken into custody by Constable Bartholomew, 548 A, acting on the information of the lad Colling. The prisoner, when brought to the spot where the robbery had taken place, was at once identified and charged by the prosecutrix with the robbery. He became violent, bit one of the constables severely in the arm, and it required the aid of three persons besides the two officers to convey him to the police station. The watch was not found.\u2014The defence set up by the prisoner was that the prosecutrix had been in his company treating him all the afternoon, and for that purpose he called two of his comrades. The jury, after a short conference, returned a verdict of \"Guilty.\"\u2014In answer to the court, the sergeant of the prisoner's company said that he bore a very bad character in the regiment. The recorder said the prisoner was very properly convicted of a cruel and unmannerly robbery, and had aggravated his serious offence by the defence he had attempted. The sentence of the court was that he be kept in penal servitude for the term of seven years.\n\nBURGLARY.\u2014John Dooley, twenty-two, was indicted for having burglariously broken into the dwelling-house of William Weall, and stealing a purse and other property.\u2014The evidence clearly proved that the prisoner entered the premises of the prosecutor, situated at Lothbury-park, Brixton. Some of the property stolen was found on the prisoner.\u2014In his defence, the prisoner said that the robbery was very much exaggerated, and that it was possible the policeman who took him into custody, and who was silly, was the real thief.\u2014The jury, without waiting for his lordship to sum up, said they were satisfied of the prisoner's guilt.\u2014Mr. Bealey said that when the prisoner was in custody he told Mr. Weall that a quarter cask of sherry, which he had upset, was the only thing worth having.\u2014His lordship sentenced the prisoner to twelve months' imprisonment with hard labour.\n\nTHE CASE OF ALLEGED CONCEALMENT OF BIRTH.\u2014On Wednesday, Mary Gennaw, twenty-eight, spinster, was indicted for having concealed the birth of a child of which she had been delivered. The indictment charged Thomas Aldridge with complicity, but with respect to him the grand jury had ignored the bill.\u2014From Mr. Lilley's opening it transpired that so far from concealment, the prisoner had not only mentioned her condition to several persons, but had actually employed an undertaker publicly to inter the child.\u2014Mr. Cooper, on this, submitted the indictment could not be sustained.\u2014The recorder concurred, and directed the jury to acquit the prisoner, who was at once discharged.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3206223444.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 740, "total-output-tokens": 843, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 3712, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
