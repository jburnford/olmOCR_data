On Sunday the prisoners were pushing each other about in Battersea Park and behaving in every way disorderly. Foy went up to Baker, who was sitting with his wife on a seat, and knocked his hat off. Wilmshurst afterwards came along riding a bicycle, and Pratt deliberately pushed him off the machine. They used very disgusting language when spoken to on the subject. Pratt told the magistrate that he was only larking. Mr. Denman said such conduct was perfectly disgraceful and beyond toleration. He fined each prisoner 40s., or one month in default.\n\nArthur Ernest Jewell, who gave an address in New Kent-road, was charged with assaulting Charles Jeffreys, living at 19, Elinor-grove, Barnes. The complainant was standing at his front door, when the prisoner, without the least provocation, struck him a blow on the head with a stick. There was no defence, and Mr. Denman committed the prisoner for two months.\n\nWIFE MURDER.\u2014At the Leeds Assizes, Moses Cudworth, forty, a clogger, was indicted for murdering his wife at Skipton on June 4th. The evidence showed that the prisoner took his wife and child up a lane towards a neighbouring village, but he and the child returned alone. Cudworth confessed to several persons that he had murdered his wife, and said he did not regret it. It is supposed that the prisoner battered his victim's head in with a sharp stone. The prisoner was sentenced to death.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3200810649.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 1522, "total-output-tokens": 423, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 1708, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
