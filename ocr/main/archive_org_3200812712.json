G. Patton, school attendance officer, said that two or three months ago two of the children were sent from school in consequence of their dirty condition, and he visited them frequently at their homes. They were invariably filthy and ragged. Miss Turner, assistant mistress at West-hill School, said the children were sent home to get washed. She had complained of their dirty appearance, and their clothing was insufficient. One of the girls had twice called at her house begging for food. Inspector Hayes, Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, said that he called at the defendants' house on February 22nd. The woman told him that she paid 4s. 6d. a week rent. The living-room was in a filthy condition; the boards had not been washed for months. Two children sat on the stools, their bare feet being in the ashes of the grate. They only wore a cotton garment, tied round the neck, and open at the back. All of them were in a terribly dirty condition. In the result the man was fined \u00a32 and costs, and the woman committed for two months' hard labour.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3200812712.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 2074, "total-output-tokens": 331, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 1362, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
