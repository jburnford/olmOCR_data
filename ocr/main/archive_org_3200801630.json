LEGG.\n\nQUEEN'S BENCH DIVISION.\u2014(Before Lord Coleridge and Mr. Justice Mathow.)\u2014In this case a rule had been granted for a certiorari to remove an indictment for libel preferred against George Francis Legg, a solicitor, on the prosecution of Harold Alexander, an officer in her Majesty's army, from the Central Criminal Court to this Court, in order that it might be tried before a special jury. The circumstances were as follow: Both the defendant and prosecutor are members of the Cocoa Tree Club, in St. James's-street, Piccadilly, and on the 8th of December, 1884, they played at cards there the result being that Mr. Alexander won \u00a31,760 from Mr. Legg, who, as he was losing, said he would only lose \u00a3500, which he was ready at once to pay, provided that any sum exceeding that amount should be played for on a future evening. They subsequently played a few games, when Mr. Alexander won an additional \u00a3200, and the defendant paid his \u00a3500, the balance standing over. A few weeks afterwards Mr. Legg, according to his affidavit, heard that Mr. Alexander had been accused of cheating by Mr. Wyndham of \u00a3550 at cards, at the Road Club, in January, 1885, and on the 15th of February the defendant wrote a letter to the committee of the Cocoa Tree Club to the effect that Mr. Harold Alexander had been compelled to resign his membership of the Road Club, having been detected at cheating at cards, and that he was prepared to prove this charge. This was the libel complained of, and for which he was committed for trial, but was allowed to stand out on his own recognisances of \u00a350. The matter now came before this court on an application by Mr. Matthews, which was opposed by Mr. Gill, to expedite the hearing of the rule for the certiorari, in order that the trial might take place before the prosecutor had to rejoin his regiment in India. The Court, disapproving of the course taken by the prosecutor in instituting criminal proceedings in the case of a private squabble, refused the application with costs.\n\nAt the Hull Police-court, on Thursday, a young girl named Isabella Hewson was charged with the murder of her illegitimate child by hanging it. On her brother being called she became terribly excited, shrieked out the name of her child, and went into several fits. She was so violent that two female warders and several officers had to hold her. The hearing of the case had to be suspended.\n\nAt the West Bromwich Police-court, on Saturday, John Taylor, of Handsworth, was sentenced to three months' imprisonment for embezzling money belonging to Messrs. Warden and Co., trading as the Phoenix Nut and Bolt Company, in whose employ he was as assistant warehouseman. The defence was that prisoner had been in bad company, and had been led away by betting men.\n\nAt the Guildhall Police-court William Stogman, 12, Windsor-street, Bishopsgate-street, carman; George Wood, a bag dealer, who refused his address; William Green, 23, Zoar-street, Southwark, general dealer; and Alfred Moon, a labourer, who said he had no fixed residence, were committed for trial on the charge of being concerned together in stealing a case from a truck in Walls-street, which contained seventy-eight fancy waistcoats, the property of Edwin Seamark, 51, Church-street, Newington, a dealer.\n\nAt the Lambeth Police-court Isabella Gutteridge was charged on remand with stabbing her husband with a shoemaker's knife. The case was reported last week, and it was then shown that the man had received a stab on the left side, and was under the care of a surgeon. Police-constable 166 L now stated that the injured man was still unable to attend, and the surgeon at present was unable to say how soon he would be able to do so. Mr. Chance said if that were the case the prisoner must again be remanded.\n\nJOSEPH COLLIER, landlord of the White Hart public-house, Myddleton-street, Clerkenwell, was summoned, at the Clerkenwell Police-court, for assaulting Edward Dennis in that house on June 4th. The complainant stated that he was in the public-house with several other men, and an altercation arose. The defendant called them \"poor people.\" Complainant retorted that it was a lie, and the defendant at once struck him with his fist. Mr. Barstow asked the complainant what could he expect if he called a man a liar, and dismissed the case.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3200801630.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 648, "total-output-tokens": 1046, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 4330, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
