C. Wilson from Ceylon for a period of six months to stock the Nilgiri streams with trout and to enquire generally into the question of fish preservation in the Nilgiri district.\n\nHis investigations were carried out during 1907 and were published in pamphlet form. He found that poachers on the Bhavani and the Moyar and their tributaries were rapidly emptying these rivers of all their fish, partly by the use of dynamite, partly by poisoning, and more especially by the capture of fry in the higher reaches of the rivers by fish traps, cuivres, and various mechanical devices.\n\nWith regard to the introduction of trout he found that the Avalanche, Pykara, Emerald-Valley, and Billithadaballa streams were suitable for stocking.\n\nAt the end of 1907, Government appointed Mr. Wilson as Piscicultural Expert for a period of five years; and, accepting his recommendations with regard to the necessity of fish conservancy below the plateau appointed a Fishery Inspector and eighteen watchers to work under the orders of the District Forest Officer.\n\nSpecial rules were notified under the Indian Fishery Act for the protection of the Bhavani, Siruvani, Gopaneri and Moyar rivers in December 1907.\n\nIn the meantime a commencement had been made in building a trout hatchery and ponds at Avalanche, some 35 trout up to 16\" in length were transferred from the Parson's-Valley to the Krumund stream, and a consignment of 100,000 eyed ova of T. irideus from Herr Jaffe's hatchery at Osnabruck, Germany, were received. The importation of the ova was a failure. They were brought up from Mettupalaiyam by a motor steam car owing to a breach on the railway. The car broke down several times and generated great heat and vibration. The result was that the majority of the eggs were dead on arrival at Avalanche and those still alive, when hatched out, produced deformed aliveness with distorted vertebral columns.\n\nIn 1908, Mr. Wilson endeavoured to arrange for a fresh supply of eggs from Lord Denbigh's hatcheries in Wales but the arrangements fell through owing to very cold and inclement weather in the spring. Finally recourse was had to the New South Wales Government who arranged for a supply of 50,000 rainbow trout ova from New Zealand and despatched them to Colombo by mail steamer in September 1909.\nThe eggs were brought safely to Avalanche and were hatched out there with remarkable success during the cold weather. The hatchery buildings and ponds had been completed during the year and 100 trout from the Parson's-Valley stream had been transferred to neighbouring streams and sixteen large trout placed in the hatchery stock pond.\n\nIn the following year, 39,625 trout fry were distributed among the Avalanche, Emerald-Valley, Pykara, Krurmund, Billithada-halla and Parson's Valley streams and in the Tiger Hill reservoir and the Lovedale Lake, while Parson's-Valley stream was netted and 100 fish taken out and placed in the Krurmund and Pykara waters.\n\nLater in the year a supply of 25,000 ova of English trout, presented to Government by Mr. Wilson, was received at the hatchery and hatched out. The fry were placed in a tributary of the Bithura-halla.\n\nTrout fishing on the Nilgiris was thrown open to the public for the first time in 1911 and the season was opened by His Excellency Sir Arthur Lawley on September 5th, at Hodgson's Hut on the Krurmund stream.\n\nThe season was a short one lasting only until the end of the month and fishing was confined to a few streams, but 82 rods killed 137 fish weighing 200 lb. and the heaviest fish caught weighed 5 lb. The establishment of trout on the plateau was thus demonstrated beyond dispute and in subsequent seasons trout fishing has greatly added to the attractions of Ootacamund.\n\nThe trout breed freely in all the streams of the Kundahs and the Wenlock-Downs, and provided the waters are kept stocked with sufficient fish food there is no reason to doubt that the success already obtained will be permanent.\n\nNew fishing rules were issued by Government in May 1912 both for the protection of trout and for indigenous fish in the rivers below the plateau. With regard to the conservancy of the latter the results are not easily estimated but it is believed that the measures of protection taken since 1908 have resulted in a very large increase in the amount of fish, which are now found in greater numbers than formerly in the lower waters.\n\nChapter VII, Means of communication\u2014Railways, page 237.\u2014Insert the following:\n\nSouth Indian Railway Company, Limited.\nNilgiri Railway 3'-3\" gauge.\n\n1. The original Nilgiri Railway Company was registered on the 30th September 1885, with a nominal capital of Rs. 25,00,000 and a contract was executed between the Secretary of State and that company on the 26th February 1886. The original company went into liquidation in April 1894, and a new company was formed in February 1896 to purchase the line from the former company and supply the capital required to complete it and to construct the proposed extension to Ootacamund.\n2. The line from Mettupalaiyam to Coonoor was completed by the new company and opened for traffic on the 15th June 1899. On the offer of the new company to sell the line it was purchased by the Government for \u00a3285,000 on the 1st January 1903.\n\n3. The extension to Ootacamund was constructed by the Government and the capital employed was Rs. 30,75,112. This railway has been opened for traffic as under:\n\n| Section of railway          | Date of opening | Miles |\n|-----------------------------|-----------------|-------|\n| Mettupalaiyam to Coonoor    | 15 June 1899    | 16'99 |\n| Coonoor to Fernhill         | 15 Sept. 1908   | 10'86 |\n| Fernhill to Ootacamund     | 15 Oct. 1908    | 1'11  |\n| Total                       |                 | 28'96 |\n\n4. Details of construction:\n(a) Permanent way.\u2014The permanent way consists of flat footed steel rails, 50 lb. to the yard, laid on pyngadu sleepers. Between Kallar and Coonoor (twelve miles) there is also a central rack rail.\n(b) Ballast.\u2014Rack section is ballasted with clean broken granite and the adhesion section with hard gneiss.\n(c) Fencing.\u2014The line is unfenced throughout.\n(d) Curves.\u2014The sharpest curve is of 318 feet radius.\n(e) Gradients.\u2014The gradients on the several sections of this railway range as follows:\n(i) Between Kallar and Mettupalaiyam from one in 40 to one in 70.\n(ii) Between Kallar and Coonoor from one in 12'28 to one in 29'27 (worked on the Abt system\u2014an improved modification of the Rigi Rack Rail principle).\n(iii) Between Coonoor and Ootacamund from one in 800 to one in 23'81.\nSections (i) and (iii) are ordinary adhesion railway and section (ii) is on the rack system.\nThe ruling gradient is one in 12'5 on the rack section and one in 25 on the Adhesion section.\nThis railway is worked on the absolute block system.\n\n5. The railway was worked by the former Madras Railway Company up to 31st December 1907 on behalf of the Government. With effect from 1st January 1908, it was made over to the South Indian Railway Company as a part of the Jalarpet-Mangalore section for working as an integral part of their undertaking in terms of the contract of 2nd March 1909 between the Secretary of State and the Company.\n\"A book that is shut is but a block\"\n\nCENTRAL ARCHAEOLOGICAL LIBRARY\n\nGOVT.
