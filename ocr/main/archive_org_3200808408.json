They were further charged with assaulting Ellis and his wife.\u2014Prosecutor said that he occupied the first floor front at a house in London-street. On Saturday he was a witness in this court against a man named Miller, and two women, named Ring and Keroiski, who were charged with stealing \u00a320 from a hairdresser, of Seaton-street, and on his returning in the afternoon he found the prisoners had forcibly entered his apartments, and were smashing his furniture and effects. He seized Barnett, and struggled with him, and then Howard held his wife, and a great commotion followed. Barnett was a lodger in the same house, but Howard was a stranger there. Mrs. Ellis said that after her little girl had knocked the door of their room Barnett forcibly pushed it open and struck her (witness), whilst Howard shouted, \"Give it her.\" When her husband returned from the court he seized Howard, and there was a great hubbub, and the whole house and neighbourhood became in an uproar. The damage done was estimated at \u00a35 10s. Barnett said that Ellis came back drunk, and the damage was done in their struggles. None of it was done wilfully. Howard said he could not understand what it was about, as he had accepted an invitation from Barnett to take tea with him, and knew nothing about the lodgers. Ellis's little daughter said that Barnett kicked her mother, and then he smashed the lamp and other things with a piece of iron. Her father arrived after the damage had been done. Constable 388 D said when he went after the prisoners he found them in a drunken state in the Tottenham-court-road. A witness for Barnett, a female lodger in the same house, said that when Ellis came home he struck Barnett, and knocked him down against her door. Then they struggled together in Ellis's room and the furniture was broken. Other witnesses spoke against the Ellises. They were noisy people, it was said, and none of the lodgers could get much rest for them. The constable said that Ellis himself and everyone in the house had been drinking. When he entered all the women \"flew\" downstairs and wanted to get at Mrs. Ellis. All the things in Ellis's room were broken up, except the bedstead and bolster, and the damage could not have been caused merely by a struggle. Mr. Hannay fined the prisoners 40s., and 40s. damage each, or imprisonment for a month.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3200808408.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 1062, "total-output-tokens": 620, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 2648, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
