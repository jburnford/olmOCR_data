On June 1st, 1887, and following days, an Examination, open to all qualified persons, will be held in London (a). Not fewer than persons will be selected, if so many shall be found duly qualified; viz., for the Lower Provinces of Bengal (including Assam); for the Upper Provinces of Bengal (including the Punjab and Oudh); for Burma; for Madras, and for Bombay (b).\n\n2. No person will be deemed qualified who shall not satisfy the Civil Service Commissioners:\u2014\n\n(i.) That he is a natural-born subject of Her Majesty.\n\n(ii.) That his age will be above seventeen years and under nineteen years on the 1st of January, 1887. [N.B.\u2014In the case of Natives of India this must be certified by the Government of India or of the Presidency or Province in which the Candidate may have resided.]\n\n(iii.) That he has no disease, constitutional affection, or bodily infirmity unfitting him, or likely to unfit him, for the Civil Service of India.\n\n(iv.) That he is of good moral character.\n\n3. Should the evidence upon the above points be prima facie satisfactory to the Civil Service Commissioners, the Candidate, on payment of the prescribed fee (c), will be admitted to the Examination. The Commissioners may, however, in their discretion, at any time prior to the grant of the Certificate of Qualification hereinafter referred to, institute such further inquiries as they may deem necessary; and if the result of such inquiries in the case of any Candidate should be unsatisfactory to them in any of the above respects, he will be ineligible for admission to the Civil Service of India; and if already selected, will be removed from the position of a Probationer.\n\n4. The Examination will take place only in the following branches of knowledge:\u2014\n\n| Branches of Knowledge | Marks |\n|-----------------------|-------|\n| English Composition   | 300   |\n| History of England\u2014Including a period selected by the Candidate | 300 |\n| English Literature\u2014including books selected by the Candidate | 300 |\n| Greek                 | 600   |\n| Latin                 | 800   |\n| French                | 500   |\n| German                | 500   |\n| Italian               | 400   |\n| Mathematics (pure and mixed) | 1,000 |\n| Natural Science: that is, the elements of any two of the following Sciences, viz.:\u2014Chemistry, 500; Electricity and Magnetism, 300; Experimental Laws of Heat and Light, 300; Mechanical Philosophy, with outlines of Astronomy, 300; Logic, 300; Elements of Political Economy, 300; Sanskrit, 500; Arabic, 500 |\n\nCandidates are at liberty to name any or all of these branches of knowledge. No subjects are obligatory.\n\n(a) An order for admission to the Examination will be sent to each Candidate on the 18th of May.\n\n(b) The numbers will be announced hereafter.\n\n(c) The Fee (\u00a35) will be payable by means of a special stamp according to instructions which will be communicated to Candidates.\n\n5. The merit of the persons examined will be estimated by marks; and the number set opposite to each branch in the preceding regulation denotes the greatest number of marks that can be obtained in respect of it.\n\n6. The marks assigned to Candidates in each branch will be subject to such deduction as the Civil Service Commissioners may deem necessary (g), in order to secure that \"a Candidate be allowed no credit at all for taking up a subject in which he is a mere smatterer.\"\n\n7. The Examination will be conducted on paper and viv\u00e6 voce, as may be deemed necessary.\n\n8. The marks obtained by each Candidate, in respect of each of the subjects in which he shall have been examined, will be added up, and the names of the several Candidates who shall have obtained, after the deduction above mentioned, a greater aggregate number of marks than any of the remaining Candidates will be set forth in order of merit, and such Candidates shall be deemed to be Selected Candidates for the Civil Service of India, provided they appear to be in other respects duly qualified. Should any of the Selected Candidates become disqualified, the Secretary of State for India will determine whether the vacancy thus created shall be filled up or not. In the former case, the Candidate next in order of merit, and in other respects duly qualified, shall be deemed to be a Selected Candidate. A Selected Candidate declining to accept the appointment which may be offered to him will be disqualified for any subsequent competition.\n\n9. Selected Candidates, before proceeding to India, will be on probation for two years, during which time they will be examined periodically, with a view of testing their progress in the following subjects:\u2014\n\n| Subjects                          | Marks |\n|-----------------------------------|-------|\n| Law                               | 1,250 |\n| Classical Languages of India\u2014     |       |\n| Sanskrit                          | 500   |\n| Arabic                            | 400   |\n| Persian                           | 400   |\n| Vernacular Languages of India (each) | 400 |\n| The History and Geography of India | 350   |\n| Political Economy                 | 350   |\n\nIn these Examinations, as in the open competition, the merit of the Candidates examined will be estimated by marks, and the number set opposite to each subject denotes the greatest number of marks that can be obtained in respect of it.\n\n(d) A considerable portion of the marks for English History and Literature will be allotted to the work selected by the Candidate. (See Notice on p. x.) In awarding marks for this, regard will be had partly to the extent and importance of the periods or books selected, but chiefly to the thoroughness with which they have been studied.\n\n(e) The Examination will range from Arithmetic, Algebra, and Elementary Geometry, up to the elements of the differential and integral calculus, including the lower portions of applied Mathematics.\n\n(f) The standard of marking in Sanskrit and Arabic will be determined with reference to a high degree of proficiency, such as may be expected to be reached by a Native of good education.\n\n(g) Marks assigned in English Composition and Mathematics will be subject to no deduction. Each science will, for the purpose of deduction, be treated as a separate subject.\n\n(h) Full instructions as to the course of study to be...\nobtained in respect of it at any one Examination. The Examination will be conducted on paper and *viva voce*, as may be deemed necessary. The last of these Examinations will be held at the close of the second year of probation, and will be called the \"Final Examination,\" at which it will be decided whether a Selected Candidate is qualified for the Civil Service of India. At this Examination Candidates will be permitted to take up any one of the following branches of Natural Science, viz.\u2014Agricultural Chemistry, Botany, Geology, or Zoology, for which 350 marks will be allowed.\n\n10. Candidates will be tested during their probation as to their ability to perform journeys on horseback; and no Candidate will be deemed qualified for the Civil Service of India who fails to satisfy the Civil Service Commissioners of his competence in this respect.\n\n11. Any Candidate who, at any of the periodical Examinations, shall appear to have wilfully neglected his studies, or to be physically incapacitated for pursuing the prescribed course of training, will be liable to have his name removed from the list of Selected Candidates.\n\n12. The Selected Candidates who, at the Final Examination, shall be found to have a competent knowledge of the subjects specified in Regulation 9, and who shall have satisfied the Civil Service Commissioners of their eligibility in respect of nationality, age, health, character, and ability to ride, shall be certified by the said Commissioners to be entitled to be appointed to the Civil Service of India, provided they shall comply with the regulations in force, at the time, for that Service.\n\n13. Persons desirous to be admitted as Candidates must apply on Forms, which may be obtained from \"The Secretary, Civil Service Commission, London, S.W.\", at any time after the 1st December, 1886. The Forms must be returned so as to be received at the Office of the Civil Service Commissioners on or before 31st March, 1887 (i).\n\nThe Civil Service Commissioners are authorised by the Secretary of State for India in Council to make the following announcements:\n\n(1.) Selected Candidates will be permitted to choose, according to the order in which they stand in the list resulting from the open competition, so long as a choice remains, the Presidency (and in Bengal the Division of the Presidency) to which they shall be appointed; but this choice will be subject to a different arrangement, should the Secretary of State, or the Government of India, deem it necessary (k).\n\n(2.) The Probationers, having passed the necessary Examinations, will be required to report their arrival in India, within such period after the grant of their Certificate of Qualification as the Secretary of State may in each case direct.\n\n(3.) The seniority in the Civil Service of India of the Selected Candidates shall be determined according to the Order in which they stand on the list resulting from the Final Examination.\n\npursued will be issued to the successful Candidates as soon as possible after the result of the Open Competition is declared.\n\n(i) These Forms should be accompanied by evidence on the points mentioned in Regulation 2, and by a list of the subjects in which the Candidate desires to be examined. Evidence of health and character must bear date not earlier than 1st March, 1887. Applications for leave to alter or add to the list of subjects named will not be entertained unless received on or before the 4th of May.\n\n(k) This choice must be exercised immediately after the result of the Open Competition is announced, on such day as may be fixed by the Civil Service Commissioners.\n\n**NOTICE RESPECTING THE EXAMINATION IN THE HISTORY OF ENGLAND, AND ENGLISH LITERATURE.**\n\n**HISTORY OF ENGLAND.**\n\nFor the guidance of Candidates who may have a difficulty in making their selections for special study under this head, the following list is given as indicating the character and amount of reading that would be regarded as satisfactory.\n\nAny one of the following periods, to be studied generally in \"Bright's History,\" or (for the two first periods) Green's \"History of the English People,\" and more particularly in portions, selected by the Candidate, of the Text-books named:\n\n1.

Spenser.\u2014Faery Queen, Books 1 and 2.\n2. Shakespeare.\u2014Othello, Tempest.\n3. Bacon.\u2014Essays, xxvii. to lviii., inclusive.\n4. Milton.\u2014Paradise Lost, Books 1 and 2.\n5. Macaulay.\u2014Biography of Johnson, Essay on Warren Hastings.\n\nThe oral examination in English Literature will have reference chiefly to such works, not included in the foregoing list, as the Candidate may offer for the purpose.\n\nCHAPLAINS.\n\nREGULATIONS FOR THEIR ADMISSION.\n\nCandidates for appointments as Junior Chaplains must have been two years in Orders, and be under thirty-four years of age, and must, prior to appointment, produce their letters of Orders, Deacon, and Priest, as well as testimonial, signed by three bene\u00acficed clergymen; the appointments are made subject to the approval of the Archbishop of Canterbury or the Bishop of London.\n\nChaplains must proceed to their destination within four months from the date of their nomination by the Secretary of State, and in failure thereof, without leave obtained from the Secretary of State for India in Council, their appointments will lapse.\n\nChaplains must, as a condition of their appointment, subscribe to the Indian Service Family Pension Fund from the date of their arrival in India.\n\nThe widows and families of Chaplains are also entitled to pensions, under the terms of such Royal Warrant, regulating the grant of pensions to the widows and families of British Officers, as may be in force at the time being. (The Royal Warrant of 10th June, 1884, is the one now in force.)\n\nREGULATIONS FOR ADMISSION TO THE ROYAL INDIAN ENGINEERING COLLEGE, COOPER'S HILL, (NEAR STAINES).\n\n[The arrangements hereinafter described are subject to revision under the orders of the Secretary of State.]\n\nThe Royal Indian Engineering College has been established under the orders of the Secretary of State for India in Council, in view to the education of Civil Engineers for the service of Government in the Indian Public Works Department; but it is open, to the extent of the accommodation available, to all persons desirous of following the course of study pursued in it.\n\n2. Sixty students will be admitted yearly to the College. Candidates for admission must be between the ages of seventeen and twenty-one years on the 1st day of July of the year of admission, and of good moral character; they must have had a good general education, and have attained to a sufficient degree of proficiency in elementary mathematics to enable them to follow the College course with advantage.\n\n3. In the event of there being more candidates for admission than the College can receive, the preference will be given to qualified candidates according to dates of application for admission.\n\n4. Applications for admission, supported by certificates of character and evidence of age, should be addressed to the Secretary to the College, not later than the last week of June in each year.*\n\n5. Candidates whose applications are found satisfactory as to age and character will be required to undergo an examination, to be held at the College, about the end of June, in the following subjects:\u2014(1.) English Composition, to the extent of being able to write grammatically, and with correct spelling, in a neat and legible hand. (2.) The following branches of mathematics; viz., Arithmetic, Algebra,\u2020 Geometry,\u2021 Mensuration, and Plane Trigonometry.\u00a7\n\n6. They will also be required to give evidence of having received a fair general education, by certificate from their school or college, or by undergoing an examination in some classical or modern language, and in history or geography.\n\n7. A fee of \u00a32 will be payable in advance by each candidate accepted for examination, and will not under any circumstances be returnable.\n\n8. The course in Engineering extends over three years; that in Telegraphy over two years. The appointments in the Indian Public Works Department offered for competition by the Secretary of State for India are awarded at the end of the three years' course (see art. 19); those offered in the Indian Telegraph Department are awarded at the end of two years. (See art. 29.)\n\n9. Each annual session begins in September, and is divided into three terms, with vacations of four weeks at Christmas, two weeks at Easter, and eight weeks in the Summer.\n\n10. An annual charge of \u00a3180 is made for each student, which must be paid in advance to the Bank of England, in three sums of \u00a360 per term. Receivable orders with full directions as to the mode of payment will be forwarded from the India Office, shortly before the fees fall due, to the parents or guardians of the students.\n\n11. A deposit of \u00a35 is required to be paid by each student on admission to the College, as caution money, to cover charges incurred by him for damage to books, instruments, &c., or any College bills outstanding on leaving the College, when the balance standing at his credit will be repaid. This deposit is to be paid with the fee for the first term, making the total payment on that occasion \u00a365.\n\n12. The College fees include all charges for tuition, board, according to the College tariff, and lodging, with washing, but not for medical attendance. Students are required to provide their own class books and drawing instruments. Drawing paper, drawing boards, and surveying instruments, are provided by the College.\n\n13. The subjects of study at the College are:\u2014\n\nPure and applied Mathematics.\nApplied Mechanics.\nExercises in Design.\nChemistry (Theoretical and Practical).\nPhysics (Mathematical and Practical).\nMineralogy and Geology.\nDescriptive Engineering.\nGeometrical Drawing.\nFreehand Drawing.\nArchitecture.\nSurveying.\nEstimating.\nAccounts.\nFrench.\nGerman.\nMechanical Laboratory.\nWorkshop Practice.\nTelegraphy.\nTelegraph Construction.\n\n14. The proficiency of the students in the studies pursued is tested by periodical examinations, and by assigning values to the drawings, surveys, notes, &c., executed by them while at the College.\n\n15. The subjects enumerated in Article 13 are grouped in four main branches of study, and a certain minimum of qualification is required in each branch of study, as well as a certain minimum of average proficiency in all the branches taken together, as tested by the aggregate marks gained, in order to obtain the ordinary College diploma (see art. 17). But students are encouraged to pursue more particularly those branches of study beyond the limits of the obligatory course for which they may show special aptitude. Superior attainments will be recognised by special diplomas. (See art. 17.)\n\n16. A final examination will be held during the last year, with the assistance of special examiners not connected with the College. This final examination, in addition to paper work and viva voce questioning, will embrace exercises in surveying, drawing, designing, and estimating, which will occupy some weeks in execution.*\n\n17. Students who pass out of the College with special distinction will be appointed \"Honorary Fellows of Cooper's Hill.\" The Diploma of \"Associate\" will be bestowed on all others who pass out in the first class in one at least of the four branches mentioned in art. 15. All others who come up to the prescribed standard of qualification will receive the ordinary College diploma of Graduate.\n\n18. Every student will be required to conform to the College rules, to exhibit due diligence in his studies throughout his course, and to give evidence of satisfactory progress at the different examinations, failing which, or in the event of serious personal misconduct, he will not be allowed to remain at the College.\n\n**Indian Public Works Appointments.**\n\n19. The number of appointments in the Indian Public Works Department which will be available yearly for the passed students of the College will be notified by advertisement, if possible, three years before the time of the admission to the College of the students concerned.\u2020\n\n20. The passed students, being British subjects, of sound constitution, and free from any serious physical defects which would render them unfit for employment in the Public Works Department of India, the final decision on which point will rest with the Secretary of State for India, will be eligible for these appointments in their order of standing at the final examination.\n\n21. The passed students thus selected will be appointed Assistant Engineers, Second Grade, from the 1st October in the year of their passing out of the College, from which date also their service for pension will count. They will be provided with free passages to India, either on leaving the College or after the completion of a course of practical engineering in England, as may be arranged. (See art. 24.)\n\n22. They will be allowed before leaving for India to choose the province and branch of the profession in which they desire to be first employed, according to their standing and within the limit of the available vacancies in the different branches, on the understanding, however, that they will be at all times liable to transfer from one province or branch to another at the pleasure of the Government of India, and according to the exigencies of the public service.\n\n* Further particulars regarding the course of studies and distribution of marks allotted at the final examination will be found in the College Calendar, published by Messrs. W. H. Allen & Co., Waterloo Place, S.W., and to be had of any bookseller, price five shillings.\n\n\u2020 The number of appointments in the Indian Public Works Department to be offered for competition in 1890 among the students entering Cooper's Hill College in 1887 is 15.\n\n23. The prescribed departmental and language examinations have to be passed in India, according to the regulations of the service, as a necessary condition for obtaining promotion to a higher grade.\n\n24. Every Assistant Engineer may be required to go through a course of practical engineering, under a civil or mechanical engineer, before proceeding to India. While so employed he will receive pay at the rate of \u00a3150 a year, to commence from the date of entering on the practical course, and in addition will be eligible to receive a premium of from \u00a310 to \u00a325 in each half-year during the course, according to the degree of proficiency and diligence shown. The practical course will commonly last for a year, at the expiration of which the Assistant Engineer, if reported qualified, will be provided with a passage to India, and will be entitled to receive his salary at the Indian rate, which is at present Rs. 4,200 per annum from the date of embarkation, unless from any cause he fails to arrive in India within two months from the date appointed for his embarkation, in which case his salary at Indian rates will begin from the date of his arrival in India.\n\n25. The fees to the Engineers under whom the practical course is passed will be paid by the Secretary of State for India, unless the Assistant Engineer voluntarily relinquishes his appointment, in which case they will have to be refunded.\n\n26. An Assistant Engineer not making a sufficiently good use of the time passed on the practical course may be liable to be required to go through a further course, without pay, before proceeding to India, or in extreme cases his appointment may be cancelled.\n\n27. The time spent on the practical course will count as service towards pension.\n\n28. If the practical course in England should be dispensed with, the young Engineers will proceed direct to India, and their salaries, at Indian rates, will commence from the date of embarkation, unless from any cause they fail to arrive in India within two months from the date appointed for their embarkation, in which case their salary will commence from the date of their landing in India, as well as their service for pension, instead of from the date mentioned in Clause 21.\n\n**Indian Telegraph Appointments.**\n\n29. Nominations to the Indian Telegraph Department will also be made from the College, previous notice of the number available being given by advertisement as early as practicable. Students, being British subjects, and considered fit for employment in the Indian Telegraph Department under the general conditions stated in art. 20, will be eligible for these appointments to the extent of the available vacancies, in their order of standing at the end of the first year's course.\n\n30. The students thus selected will go through a second year's course of special training at the College, on the satisfactory completion of which they will be appointed to the public service as Assistant Superintendents, Telegraph Department, the commencing salary of which grade is at present Rs. 3,000 a year, with effect from the 1st October in the year of their passing out of the College, from which date also their services for pension will count. They will be provided with free passages to India, and their salaries will commence from the date of embarkation, unless from any cause they fail to arrive in India within two months from the date appointed for their embarkation, in which case both salary and service for pension will count from the date of their landing in India.\n\n31. A student selected for the Indian Telegraph Department under art. 29, who during his year's course of special training does not attain to the prescribed standard of qualification, will be liable to have his appointment cancelled.\n\n**Indian Forest Appointments.**\n\n32. The candidates selected by the Secretary of State for India for the Indian Forest Department are received in the College for two years' instruction, and are required to conform to its rules.\n\n33. The method of selection, which is different from that adopted in the case of the Public Works and Telegraph Department candidates, is explained in the Indian Forest Service Prospectus, given in the next page.\nGENERAL RULES.\n\n34. The College authorities, on application from the students, will endeavour to arrange for placing those students who pass out of the College according to the prescribed standard of qualification, but do not enter the Indian service, as pupils for one or two years with Civil or Mechanical Engineers of standing, at moderate rates of premium.\n\n35. Chemical, physical, and mechanical laboratories, a library, gymnasium, and workshops are attached to the College. Means are also provided for the practice of photography. Students making use of the laboratories are supplied with the necessary apparatus. They are required to provide their own hand tools in the workshop.\n\n36. The responsibility for the discipline and management of the College and for the superintendence of the studies is vested in the President, under the general control of the Secretary of State for India, acting with the advice of the Board of Visitors.\n\n37. The students are distributed in sections, under personal charge of one of the Professors or Instructors selected as tutor by the President, to whom the tutor is responsible for exercising the proper degree of personal supervision over each student in his division, and for conducting necessary correspondence with the student's friends.\n\n38. Each student is provided with a separate room furnished, and with fuel and light, also with the necessary attendance. He is required to supply his own towels and bed linen. Meals are taken in hall. Wine and beer are not included in the ordinary fare, but can be obtained from the College cellar.\n\n39. A chapel is attached to the College.\n\n40. Every student will be required to go through a course of exercise in the gymnasium, and of military exercises, including the use of the rifle.\n\n41. Students are required to wear academical dress under such regulations as may be prescribed from time to time.\n\n42. Every student selected for the Indian Service before proceeding to India will be required to furnish to the President satisfactory evidence of his competency in riding.\n\nFOREST SERVICE IN INDIA.\n\n[These arrangements are liable to be altered.]\n\n1. An examination will be held in June, 1887, when not less than ten probationers, if so many be found duly qualified, will be selected to undergo a special training to qualify them for admission to the Forest Service of India.\n\n2. An applicant must be a natural-born British subject, and must be above 17 and under 21 years of age on the 1st of June, 1887. He must be unmarried, and, if he marry before leaving this country for India, he will forfeit his appointment.\n\n3. Any person desirous of competing at this Examination must send to the Revenue Department of the India Office, on or before the 1st day of May, 1887,\u2014\n\n(a) His name and parentage, a certificate, or other satisfactory evidence, of the date of his birth, and a statement of consent from parent or guardian.\n\n(b) A statement of the places of education at which he may have been since he was nine years old, accompanied by testimonials of good conduct during the last two years. He must also pay a fee of \u00a34, by means of a special stamp, according to instructions which will be communicated to candidates.\n\n4. Applicants will have to appear before a Medical Board at the India Office, at a date to be hereafter named. Particular stress will be laid upon good vision and hearing, and means will be taken to test physical powers of endurance, so as to ensure none being allowed to compete unless of active habits and sound constitution.\n\n* With a view to prevent parents and guardians from incurring the inconvenience and expense of preparing candidates who may be physically unfit for the Forest Service, it is suggested that candidates be submitted to examination by the medical adviser of the family, or any other qualified medical practitioner, with regard to the following points:\u2014\n\n1. A weak constitution.\n2. Defective vision.\n3. Impaired hearing.\n4. The existence of any congenital defect.\n\nIt is to be understood that this private examination is merely suggested to lessen the chances of disappointment, and that it is by no means intended to take the place of, or to influence in any way, the official examination. On the subject of the standard of eyesight required for the Indian Services, a pamphlet has been published, under the authority of the Secretary of State in Council, by Messrs. Churchill & Sons, 11, New Burlington Street.\n\n5. The subjects of examination, and the marks assigned thereto, are detailed in the following table:\u2014\n\n| Subject                          | Maximum | Minimum |\n|----------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Orthography                      | 300     | 150     |\n| Handwriting                      | 200     | 100     |\n| English Composition              | 200     | 67      |\n| Intelligence                     | 100     | \u2014       |\n| Arithmetic in all its branches   | 300     | 100     |\n| Geometry, including 1st to 4th,  |         |         |\n| and 6th Books of Euclid          | 300     | 100     |\n| Algebra up to and including Bi-  |         |         |\n| nomial Theorem, Arithmetical     |         |         |\n| and Geometrical Series, Interest |         |         |\n| and Annuities                    | 300     | 100     |\n| Logarithms, including use of     | 100     | 33      |\n| Tables                           |         |         |\n| Plane Trigonometry up to and in- |         |         |\n| cluding Solution of Plane Tri-   |         |         |\n| angles, and Calculation of       |         |         |\n| Heights and Distances            | 300     | 100     |\n| Mensuration                      | 100     | 33      |\n| Elements of Mechanics            | 300     | 75      |\n| Elements of Physics, omitting    | 300     | 75      |\n| electricity and magnetism        |         |         |\n| Inorganic Chemistry              | 400     | 133     |\n| Mechanical drawing of Geometric- |         |         |\n| al Figures (limited to the draw- | 400     | 80      |\n| ing of plane figures)            |         |         |\n| Elements of Botany               | 400     | 100     |\n| French or German Translation    | 200     | 67      |\n| Oral                             | 200     | 33      |\n\n6. The above subjects are compulsory; but in addition thereto, the annexed marks may be obtained in the following optional subjects:\u2014\n\nTranslation into French or German, the language being the same as that taken up under the compulsory subjects ... 100\n\nFreehand Drawing ... 300\n\nElements of Geology and Mineralogy ... 300\n\n7. From those competitors who attain an amount of marks not less than the minimum, and satisfy the requisite conditions in other respects, the Secretary of State will select those whom he may deem best adapted to the Service.\n\n8. The candidates so selected will undergo a course of training extending over two years and two months. During the first twenty-two months, commencing with the annual session which begins in September 1887, they will prosecute their studies at Cooper's Hill College, where arrangements have been made for instruction in forestry and in the necessary auxiliary sciences. During the last four months the candidates will be instructed, under suitable supervision, in the English or continental forests as may be selected for the purpose.\nShort tours will also be made during part of the College vacations. The entire expense of the tours and of the practical instruction will be defrayed by the Secretary of State for India in Council.\n\n9. An annual charge of \u00a3180 is made for each student, which must be paid in advance to the Bank of England, in three sums of \u00a360 per term, the total charge being \u00a3360. Receivable orders, with full directions as to the mode of payment, will be forwarded from the India Office, shortly before the fees fall due, to the parents or guardians of the students.\n\n10. A deposit of \u00a35 is required to be paid by each student on admission to the College, as caution money, to cover charges incurred by him for damage to books, instruments, &c., or any College bills outstanding on leaving the College, when the balance standing at his credit will be repaid. This deposit is to be paid with the fee for the first term, making the total payment on that occasion \u00a325.\n\n11. The College fees include all charges for tuition, board, according to the College tariff, and lodging, with washing, but not for medical attendance. Students are required to provide their own clay books and drawing instruments. Drawing paper, drawing boards, and surveying instruments, are provided by the College.\n\n12. Every student will be required to conform to the College rules, to exhibit due diligence in his studies throughout his course, and to give evidence of satisfactory progress, failing which, or in the event of serious personal misconduct, he will not be allowed to remain at the College.\n\n13. The Rules regarding the course of study and other matters may be learnt from the College Prospectus.\n\n14. Every student, before proceeding to India, will be required to furnish to the President satisfactory evidence of his competency in riding.\n\n15. During the course of training, the proficiency of the students will be tested by periodical examinations, and on the termination of their studies there will be a final examination, when, in the event of the results being satisfactory, and provided the Medical Board give a favourable certificate as to health, candidates will be nominated Junior Assistant Conservators in the Forest Department in India, their seniority being regulated by the result of all the above examinations combined.\n\n16. Within a month of his nomination as Junior Assistant, each nominee must sign articles of agreement describing the terms and conditions of his appointment; he must embark for India when required to do so by the Secretary of State, who will provide for the expenses of his passage. Failure to embark at the stated time will lead to forfeiture of appointment.\n\n17. The pay, &c., of the Forest Service may be gathered from the following table; it must, however, be clearly understood that the allowances vary in different Presidencies, and are liable to revision.\n\n| Rs. per mensem |\n|----------------|\n| Inspectors-General of Forests | 1,700 to 2,000 |\n| Conservators of Forests | 1st Grade 1,500 |\n| | 2nd ,, 1,300 |\n| | 3rd ,, 1,000 |\n| Deputy Conservators of Forests | 1st Grade 900 |\n| | 2nd ,, 800 |\n| | 3rd ,, 650 |\n| Assistant Conservators of Forests | 1st Grade 450 |\n| | 2nd ,, 350 |\n| | 3rd ,, 250 |\n\n18. The pay of a Junior Assistant Conservator (Rs. 250 per mensem) will commence from the date of arrival in India.\n\n19. The young officer will be required to report himself to the Government of India (or to the Government of Bombay or Madras, in case he should be sent to one of these Presidencies) or to such Local Government as may be specified, and he will then be posted to such place as the service may require.\n\n20. Promotion, leave, and pension will be regulated by the Rules for the time being, but an officer will not be eligible for promotion or increase of pay until he has passed an examination in such Native language as the authorities may prescribe.\n\n---\n\nAN ABSTRACT OF THE SIXTH EDITION OF THE CIVIL PENSION AND LEAVE CODES.\n\nPRELIMINARY.\n\n1. No standing order not contained in these Codes should be quoted or trusted in deciding, or submitting for orders, any question affecting Pensions, Leave, or Acting Allowances to Officers engaged in the Civil Administration. If any Officer thinks that any order not embodied in these Codes ought to be revived, he should refer the question, through the proper channel, to the Government of India. Without the special authority of the Government of India, no such order is valid.\n\nDEFINITIONS.\n\n2. In these Codes, unless there be something repugnant in the subject or context\u2014\n\nAbsence means an Officer absent, whether on leave, under suspension, or on duty, from an appointment on which he has a lien.\n\nAccountant General includes \"Comptroller General\" and \"Comptroller.\" When used in reference to a Public Servant applying for leave, or on leave, \"Accountant General\" means the Officer who audits the pay and allowances of such Public Servant.\n\nActive Service includes, besides time spent on duty in India\u2014\n\n(a) Privilege Leave of Absence.\n(b) Subsidiary Leave of Absence.\n(c) Time spent on the voyage to India by an Officer who is recalled to duty before the expiry of any recognized leave out of India, and (if within a year from the date on which he can be spared, the officer takes the unexpired portion of the leave from which he was recalled) the time spent on the return voyage to Europe,\n\n(d) And, for purposes of Pension, period of absence from India on duty of an Officer deputed or detained out of India on duty.\n\nIn the case of a Chaplain, Active Service includes also\u2014\n\n(e) Time passed in India out of employ, but not on leave.\n\nIn the case of a Covenanted Civil Servant, not being a Native Civil Servant, Active Service includes also\u2014\n\n(f) The interval between the date of an officer's first arrival in India, and the date on which he joins his first appointment.\n\n(g) Time passed, out of employ, on Subsistence Allowance, but not on Furlough.\n\n(h) Leave of Absence within the limits of the East India Company's Charter, which counted as Service and Residence under the Covenanted Service Leave Rules in force before the 8th June, 1855.\n\n(i) Leave of Absence on Urgent Private Affairs granted before the 3rd January, 1863.\n\n1. Examination Leave of Absence is also Active Service; provided that not more than twelve months of such Leave can be so reckoned to any Officer, and that leave granted under Clauses (c) and (d) of Rule I under Section 76 of the Civil Leave Code is not reckoned as Active Service, unless the Officer passes the Examination for which the Leave is granted.\n\n2. One year of Leave of Absence on Medical Certificate was reckoned as \"Residence\" under the Covenanted Service Leave Rules in force before the 1st July, 1868. This is not reckoned as Active Service.\nIn the case of a Native Civil Servant, Active Service means Active Service in the Covenanted Civil Service, and includes also any period, not exceeding two years, spent on probation in India.\n\nIn the case of a Military Officer subject to Civil Rules Active Service includes also\u2014\n\n(1) The time spent on duty in India between the date on which he became subject to the Military Furlough and Leave Rules of 1875, and the date on which he joined his first substantive Civil appointment.\n\n(2) Leave granted under Rule 10 of the Military Furlough and Leave Rules of 1875.\n\n(3) Time passed in India out of employ on Civil Subsistence Allowance, but not on Furlough.\n\n(1) Rule 1, under Clause (i) above, applies also to Military Officers subject to Civil Rules.\n\nIn the case of Engineers appointed from the Royal Indian Engineering College at Cooper's Hill who passed out of the College from the years 1878 to 1886, inclusive, Active Service includes also the whole period from date of appointment to the Service to date of joining their appointments in India, provided they fulfill the conditions in regard to date of landing in India specified in Section 68 (a) of the Civil Pension Code.\n\nAppointments are said to be in the same \"Class\" when they are in the same Department, and bear the same designation, or have been declared by the Government of India to be in the same Class. Appointments in the same Class are sometimes divided into Grades, according to pay.\n\nAverage Emoluments for the purposes of pension means the average calculated upon the last five years of service.\n\n1. If, during the last five years of his service, an Officer has been absent from duty on Leave With Allowances, or, having been suspended, has been, under Section 95 of the Civil Pension Code, reinstated without forfeiture of service, his Emoluments, for the purpose of ascertaining the Average, should be taken at what they would have been had he not been absent from duty or suspended: Provided always that his pension must not be increased on account of increase in pay not actually drawn. But if his leave is reckoned as service under Section 93, Rule 2 of the Civil Pension Code, only the allowances actually received during the Leave should be taken into account.\n\n2. If, during the last five years of his service, an Officer has been absent from duty on Leave Without Allowances, not counting for Pension, or in Inferior Service, or suspended under such circumstances that the period of suspension does not count as service, the periods so passed should be disregarded in the calculation of the Average, an equal period before the five years being included.\n\n3. Excepting as provided in Rules 1 and 2, only Emoluments actually received can be included in the calculation. For example, when an Officer is allowed to count time retrospectively towards increase of pay, but does not receive retrospectively the intermediate periodical increments, these intermediate increments are not reckoned in the calculation.\n\nAverage Salary.\u2014(I.)

Payment of these Annuities and Gratuities may be taken at the Home Treasury in sterling money, or, in India in Government rupees, at the following rate:\u2014\n\nIf the Annuitant was a member of the Bengal Civil Service,\u201410\u00bd Government rupees for each pound sterling.\n\nIf the Annuitant was a member of the Madras or Bombay Civil Service,\u201419\u00bd Government rupees for each pound sterling.\n\nProvided that any Annuitant who is a permanent resident in India, may, if he wishes to draw his Annuity in that country, exercise the option of receiving it at the rate of exchange annually fixed for the adjustment of transactions between the British and Indian Exchequers.\n\nTransfer from the Home Treasury to an Indian treasury, and vice versa, is permitted twice only.\n\nNote.\u2014The reasons for the difference in the rates of exchange are to be found in the history of the Annuity Funds. The rates of exchange differ considerably in the various Service Funds.\n\n32. After thirty-five years' service, counting from the date of his arrival in India, an Officer shall not, except for special reasons, with the sanction of the Secretary of State, retain his office, or be appointed to any new office. Provided that if such an Officer has held his office for less than five years he may, for special reasons, with the sanction of the Government of India, be permitted to retain his office until he has held it for five years. The term \"office\" in this Section includes an officiating appointment.\nCHAPTER VI.\n\nNATIVE CIVIL SERVANTS.\n\n33. Except with the special sanction of the Governor-General in Council, a Native Civil Servant, who has reached the age of fifty-five years, shall not be appointed, either substantively or officiating, to a new office, or be permitted to retain any office which he has held, either substantively or officiating, for five years.\n\n34. The pension of a Native Civil Servant shall in no case exceed the following limits, namely\u2014\n\nRs.\n\nAfter an Active Service of not less than 25 years ... ... ... ... 5,000 a year.\nAfter an Active Service of not less than 30 years ... ... ... ... 6,000 a year.\n\nAll the Rules in this Chapter are subject to these maxima.\n\n35.

The procedure upon an application for pension, and upon the payment of pension, is that described in Rule 1 under Section 29, and Chapter XII., respectively.\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\nCHAPLAINS.\n\n39. (a) In this Chapter \"Residence\" is reckoned, in the case of a Chaplain appointed in England, from arrival in India; and in the case of a Chaplain who is appointed while resident in India, from the date on which he takes charge of his office. It includes (1) Time spent on Duty, (2) Privilege and Subsidiary Leave, (3) Time passed out of employ, in India, otherwise than on Leave.\n\nNote.\u2014A Chaplain who is appointed while resident in India must not take charge of his office before the despatch appointing him is received in India. His service cannot count before such receipt.\n\n1. Chaplain on the Bengal Establishment, who is posted in England to the Lahore Diocese or to any Station in the Central Provinces or north of Allahabad, who comes to India via Bombay, and who is instructed by the Secretary of State to enquire from the Secretary to the Government of Bombay for orders as to his ultimate destination, is held to have arrived in India either on the date on which he reports his arrival at the Station to which he is directed to proceed in the orders he receives at Bombay, or, if he receives no orders at Bombay, on the date on which he reports his arrival at Allahabad. A Chaplain, who is not on the Bombay Establishment, and who is not posted to any Station in the Lahore Diocese or to any Station in the Central Provinces or north of Allahabad, but who comes out to India via Bombay, is held to have arrived in India from the date on which he reports his arrival at the Presidency town of the Presidency to which he is attached, or, if he receives orders at Bombay to proceed to any particular Station, from the date of his arrival at that Station. The report of arrival in each instance is to be made to the Bishop of the Diocese to which the Chaplain is attached.\n\n(b) \"Service\" includes \"Residence,\" and, also, all Time spent on Leave of any description; but no Time before the beginning of \"Residence.\"\n\n40. A Chaplain who has completed seventeen years Residence and twenty years' Service is entitled to a retiring pension of \u00a3365 a year.\n\n1. Pensions are granted either by the Government of India, the Government of Madras, or the Government of Bombay (as the case may be), or by the Secretary of State. A Chaplain proceeding to England on retirement without applying for pension to the Government of India\nthe Government of Bombay, or the Government of Madras (as the case may be), should procure a certificate\u2014\n\nIf he is a Chaplain on the Bengal Establishment, or a Chaplain of the Church of Scotland serving in the Bengal Presidency; \u2014from the Comptroller General,\n\nIf he is a Chaplain on the Bombay or the Madras Establishment, or a Chaplain of the Church of Scotland serving in Madras or Bombay; \u2014from the Accountant General at Bombay or Madras (as the case may be),\n\nshowing his service, residence, the amount of pension to which he is entitled, and the date from which his pension may be paid. A Chaplain to whom pension has been granted in India should be careful before proceeding to England to obtain the usual certificate of the last issue of pay or pension to him in India.\n\n2. A Chaplain belonging to the Bengal Establishment, who wishes to obtain pension from the Authorities in India, must submit his application to the Government of India in the Home Department, through the Archdeacon or Bishop of his Diocese. A Chaplain belonging to the Madras or Bombay Establishment must submit his application to the Government of Madras, or the Government of Bombay (as the case may be) through the Archdeacon or the Bishop of his Diocese. A Chaplain of the Church of Scotland serving in the Bengal Presidency, who wishes to obtain a pension from the Authorities in India, must submit his application to the Government of India in the Home Department, if he is not Senior Chaplain, through the Senior Chaplain of the Church of Scotland. A Chaplain of the Church of Scotland serving in Madras or Bombay must submit his application to the Government of Madras or Bombay, as the case may be, if he is not Senior Chaplain, through the Senior Chaplain of his Presidency. The Home Department, before accepting the resignation of a Chaplain on the Bengal Establishment, or a Chaplain of the Church of Scotland serving in the Bengal Presidency, should obtain a certificate from the Comptroller General, showing the Chaplain's service, residence and the amount of pension to which he is entitled. If the Chaplain's resignation is accepted, the case should be forwarded to the Finance Department of the Government of India, in which Department a Resolution will be recorded, granting the pension to which the Chaplain may be entitled.\n\n41. A Chaplain must retire after twenty-five years' service, unless especially exempted by the Secretary of State, on the recommendation of the Governor-General in Council, or, if he belong to the Madras or Bombay Establishment, of the Governor in Council of his Presidency.\n\nNote.\u2014As soon as a Chaplain, whether English or Scotch, completes his full period of Service, a statement should be furnished to the Government of India in the Home Department, for transmission to the Secretary of State, showing the date on which the Chaplain completes such service, whether he is in England or in India. It should also be stated whether he is on Duty or on Leave, and, if the latter, for what period.\n\n42. A Chaplain who retires on Medical Certificate before completing the periods of Residence and Service required by Section 40 will receive an Invalid Pension according to the following scale:\u2014\n\nIf he have completed fifteen years' Residence ... \u00a3292 0 0 a year.\nIf he have completed ten years' Residence ... \u00a3173 7 6 a year.\nIf he have completed seven years' Residence ... 127 15 0 a year.\nIf he have not completed seven years' Residence ... 63 17 6 a year.\n\nThese allowances are admissible only after a trial of a temperate climate, and upon a certificate from the Medical Board attached to the Office of the Secretary of State for India that the Officer is permanently unfit to serve in India.\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\nBENGAL COVENANTED PILOT SERVICE AND THEIR FAMILIES.\n\nI.\u2014PILOTS.\n\n43. (a) After an actual service of 30 years in India, a member of the Bengal Covenanted Pilot Service is entitled to a Retiring Pension according to his rank, as follows:\u2014\n\n| Rank of Retiring Officer | Monthly Pension |\n|-------------------------|---------------|\n| Branch Pilot            | Rs. 200       |\n| Any lower rank          | Rs. 100       |\n\nProviso.\u2014Not more than four Retiring Pensions may be granted in three consecutive years.\n\n(b) Upon a certificate (in a prescribed form) of incapacity for further service, from the Medical Board attached to the India Office, or from the Surgeon General, or Deputy Surgeon General in Calcutta, or from a Medical Committee, over which the Surgeon General or Deputy Surgeon General should, when practicable, preside, such a Pilot is entitled to an Invalid Pension varying according to his rank, as follows:\u2014\n\n| Rank of Retiring Officer | Monthly Pension |\n|-------------------------|---------------|\n| Branch Pilot            | Rs. 200       |\n| Master                  | Rs. 100       |\n| Mate                    | Rs. 60        |\n| Leadsman Apprentice     | Rs. 30        |\n\n44. A Pilot retiring on an Invalid Pension while absent on leave in England will receive the pension of the rank which he held when his leave began, unless he have been promoted within twelve months from that date, in which case he will receive the pension of the rank to which he has been thus promoted.\n\n(1) The Pension of a Pilot who was in the Service prior to the 30th August, 1883, if drawn in England or in the Colonies, is payable at the rate of 1s. 1\u00bdd. per rupee. The pension of a Pilot appointed to the Service after that date will be paid at the rate of exchange fixed yearly for the adjustment of transactions between the Imperial and the Indian Governments.\n\n45. Except with the special sanction of the Secretary of State, no Pilot, who has reached the age of fifty-five years, shall be appointed to a new office, or shall be permitted to retain any office which he has held for five years and upwards. The word \"Office,\" for the purposes of this Section, includes \"Grade.\"\n\nII.\u2014FAMILIES OF PILOTS.\n\n46. (a) Members of the Bengal Covenanted Pilot Service other than those described in Clause (b) must make the following contributions towards the cost of pensions for their widows and orphans:\u2014\n\n| Rank of Pilot | Monthly Contribution |\n|---------------|----------------------|\n| Branch Pilot  | Rs. 40               |\n| Master        | Rs. 20               |\n| Mate          | Rs. 10               |\n| Leadsman Apprentice | Rs. 4   |\n(b) Under a special concession made on the reorganization of the Service in 1873, the Pilots whose names are entered in the Schedule, by a monthly contribution of Rs. 16 each, secure, for their widows' pensions of Rs. 100 a month, and full pensions for their children.\n\n47. (a) The following pensions are granted to the widows and orphans of Pilots:\n\n(i) To the widows of Pilots married before their husbands retired from the service\u2014\n\n| Monthly Pension | Rs. |\n|-----------------|-----|\n| (a) To the widow of a Branch Pilot and, excepting as provided in Clause (b), of any Pilot whose name is entered in the Schedule | ... 100 |\n| (b) To the widow of any other Pilot according to the rank of her husband at the time of his death or retirement as follows\u2014 |\n| The widow of a Master Pilot | 50 |\n| \" Mate | 30 |\n| \" Leadsman Apprentice | 15 |\n\n(ii) To the children of Pilots of all ranks by wives married before their husbands retired from the service\u2014\n\n| Till age of | Rs. |\n|-------------|-----|\n| Son 15 years | ... 12 |\n| Daughter 10 | ... 14 |\n| and thereafter till marriage | ... 20 |\n\n(b) If any Pilot whose name is entered in the Schedule dies or retires before attaining the rank of Branch Pilot, and before his subscription aggregates Rs. 5,000, his widow's pension will be reduced by one-sixth, i.e., to Rs. 83 5-4 a month, until the deficiency is made up.\n\n(c) A wife married to a Pilot after his retirement from active service, and her children, are entitled to no pension. \"Retired\" and \"Retirement\" in this section mean \"Retired or Retirement on Pension.\"\n\n48. To entitle widows and orphans to pensions under these Rules, Pilots are to forward to the Port Officer certificates of their marriage, of the births of their children and of their baptism, within one month after the occurrence thereof. Notices of death are in like manner to be forwarded to the Port Officer.\n\n49. No widow who may have been legally divorced or separated from her husband for adultery, or who at the period of her husband's demise may have quitted his protection and be living in a state of notorious adultery, though not divorced or separated from him by law, or who, subsequently to her husband's decease, may be living in a notorious state of incontinence, and no female orphan living in such state, shall be entitled to receive, or continue to receive, any pension under these Rules.\n\n50. If a widow pensioner marries, her pension ceases during her coverture; but, in the event of her again becoming a widow, she shall be re-admitted to the pension to which she was entitled during her first widowhood, unless her second husband shall have been a member of the Pilot Service, and have been at his death of a higher grade than her first husband, in which case she shall be entitled to the pension of the higher rank.\n\n51. Widows, and female orphans above the age of fifteen years, are required to forward to the Accountant-General's office declarations, half-yearly, in May and November, that they are not married, and that they have not been married at any intervening period. The declarations are to be countersigned by the executor to the estate of the deceased member of the Pilot Service, or pensioner, or by the guardian of an orphan, and by a member of the Pilot Service, certifying to the truth of the declaration to the best of their knowledge and belief. Forms of the declaration will be furnished on application to the Accountant-General, Bengal.\n\n52. The pension of the family of a Pilot who was in the service on the 15th September, 1881, if drawn in England or in the Colonies, is paid at the rate of Rs. 11d. the Government rupee. The pensions of the families of Pilots appointed to the service after that date will be paid at the rate of exchange fixed yearly for the adjustment of financial transactions between the Imperial and Indian Governments.\n\n53. Subscriptions by a Pilot for the purpose of securing Pensions for his wife and children are refunded in the event of his resignation or dismissal.\n\n---\n\n* See Note at the end of this Chapter.\n\n\u2020 Note.\u2014The Schedule here referred to is a List containing the names of 38 Members of the Bengal Covenanted Pilot Service who, by a monthly payment of Rs. 16 each, secure pensions of Rs. 100 each for their widows, and full pensions for their children.\n\n---\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\nUNCOVENANTED OFFICERS.\n\nGENERAL RULES.\n\n54. Pension may not be granted to an Officer whom it is desired to remove for misconduct or inefficiency.\n\n56. A pension (except a pension granted under Section 119) is fixed in rupees and not in sterling money, even though it is to be paid in England.\n\n57. Service which is pensionable under Military Rules does not count; and an Officer who is counting service for Military pension cannot simultaneously count service for Civil pension.\n\nExample.\u2014An Officer of the old Indian Navy in civil employ cannot count his naval service.\n\n58. An officer cannot earn two pensions in the same office at the same time, or by the same continuous service.\n\nExample.\u2014A soldier who obtains his discharge from the Army is not entitled to any pension in the Military Department for the portion of his military service which he will thereupon count as civil service.\n\n59. Two Officers may not simultaneously count service in one office.\n\n60. Pension is not earned by a person whose whole time is not retained for the public service merely because he is paid for work done for the State.\n\nExample.\u2014This Rule applies, among others, to the following Officers\u2014Advocate-General, Solicitor to Government, Government Pleaders and Law Officers not debarred from private practice, Sheriffs in Presidency Towns, Coroners, Roman Catholic Priests.\n\n61. A Public Servant who holds some other pensionable office earns no pension in respect of an office of the kind mentioned in Section 60, or in respect of duties paid for by a Local Allowance.\n\n62. Service under a covenant which contains no stipulation regarding pension does not qualify, unless the Government of India specially authorises an Officer to count such service.\n\n63. An Officer who is appointed for a limited time only, or for a specified duty on the completion of which he is to be discharged, has no claim to pension.\n\n64. The service of a person employed temporarily on monthly wages without specified limit of time or duty does not qualify; but a month's notice of discharge should be given to such a person, and his wages...\nmust be paid for any period by which such notice falls short of a month.\n\n65. Service as an Apprentice (excepting (1) at the Central Forest School, in continuation of qualifying service, or (2) as an Engineer Apprentice in the Public Works Department) or, in the Bengal Presidency, as a Supernumerary Assistant Surgeon does not qualify.\n\n66. Unless it be otherwise provided by special Rule or Contract, the service of every Officer begins when he takes charge of the office to which he is first appointed.\n\nNote.\u2014In every covenant with an Officer appointed in England by the Secretary of State, not being a Covenanted Civil Servant or a Civil Engineer or Telegraph Officer educated at the Royal Engineering College, Coopers' Hill, a clause is inserted to the effect that service for Leave and Pension begins only from the date on which the Officer joins his first appointment in India.\n\n67. Except for Compensation Gratuity, Superior Service by an Officer whose age is less than twenty-two years does not qualify. But Officers described in Schedule B, excepting Class III. (2) (b), and all Officers appointed in England by the Secretary of State for service in India, are exempt from this disability.\n\n68. (a) If an Officer of Class I. in Schedule B lands in India on or before the 1st of December of the year in which he passes out of College, his service counts from the preceding 1st of October, unless another date should be specified in his letter of appointment.\n\n(b) If an Officer of Class I. is, after completing his three years' residence at College, required to go through a course of practical engineering in England under a Civil or Mechanical Engineer, his service, unless another rate should be specified in his letter of appointment, will reckon from the commencement of the practical course, or from such later date as will be consistent with the regulation that he may count as service towards pension the time spent on such practical course to the extent of one year only.\n\n(c) The service of an Officer of Class I., whose case is not provided for in Clause (b), and who does not land in India by the said 1st of December, and that of an Officer of Class II. or III. (1) counts from the date on which he landed in India.\n\n(d) The service of an Officer appointed to the Telegraph Department after training or competitive examination by the Court of Directors or the Secretary of State begins as follows:\n\nIf appointed by Court of Directors Service begins on date of arrival in India.\n\nSecretary of State\u2014\n(a) after competitive examination, covenant.\n(b) after training at the Royal Engineering College at Coopers' Hill.\n\n69. The full pension admissible under the Rules is not to be given as a matter of course, or, unless the service rendered has been really approved.\n\n1. If the service has not been thoroughly satisfactory, the Local Government should make such reduction in the amount of pension as it thinks proper.\n\nQUALIFYING SERVICE.\n\nFIRST CONDITION.\u2014SERVICE UNDER GOVERNMENT.\n\n70. The service of an Officer does not qualify unless he is appointed, and his duties and pay are regulated by the Government, or under conditions determined by the Government.\n\nSECOND CONDITION.\u2014PERMANENT AND SUBSTANTIVE EMPLOY.\n\n74. Service does not qualify unless the Officer holds a Substantive Office in a Permanent Establishment; but, upon such conditions as it may think fit in each case, to impose, the Government of India may allow temporary service to count for pension, if the pension does not exceed ten rupees a month.\n\n2. Service in an office which, although at first created experimentally, or temporarily, eventually becomes permanent, qualifies; but this rule does not apply to the case of an officer who is entertained temporarily in one appointment and afterwards transferred to another substantive appointment.\n\n3. An officer without a substantive appointment officiating in an office which is vacant, or the permanent incumbent of which does not draw any part of the pay or count service, may, if he is confirmed without interruption in his service, count his officiating service.\n\n4. The service of a probationer who holds a substantive office and draws substantive pay qualifies. So does that of an Officer who is on probation for a substantive office, if he is employed in a vacancy reserved for him pending probation, and in which no other Officer simultaneously counts service; but the service of an Officer in the Traffic Department of a State Railway before he passes the test examination does not qualify.\n\nNote.\u2014Police probationers and temporary and officiating Assistant Superintendents of Police in all Provinces count their service towards pension, provided they have passed their examinations, have served two years in the Department, and have attained the age of 22 years.\n\nTHIRD CONDITION.\u2014SOURCE OF REMUNERATION.\n\n80. Service qualifies, or does not qualify, according to the source from which it is paid.\n\n81. Service is paid as follows:\n- From the General Revenues.\n- From Local Funds.\n- From Funds in respect of which the Government holds the position only of a Trustee.\n- By Fees levied by Law, or under the authority of the Government.\n- By Commission.\n- By the grant, in accordance with Law or Custom of a tenant in land, or of any other source of income, or right to collect money.\n\n82. Service paid from the General Revenues qualifies.\n\n83. Pensions for service paid, wholly or partly, from the Revenues of Berar, and, in certain cases, of Mysore\u2014except in these cases, service in Mysore is \"Foreign Service\"\u2014are charged to those Provinces wholly, or according to the Rule of Proportions, as the case may be.\n\nNote.\u2014Pensions granted to Officers and men of the Hyderabad Contingent under Military Rules, are charged to the Revenues of Berar by the same Rule.\n\n84. The service of an Officer appointed, controlled, and paid by the Government counts, notwithstanding that the cost of his appointment may be defrayed, wholly or in part, otherwise than from the General Revenues.\n\n85. Service paid from an Excluded Local Fund does not qualify; but this Rule shall not be held to prohibit the grant and payment of pensions under the general Rules of this Code by the authorised administrators of any such Fund. The Government is in no way responsible for the sanction or continuance of such pensions, and no standing order for their payment may be issued to or received by any Government Treasury.\n\nException.\u2014This Section does not apply to Establishments paid from Port Funds managed by Government; Service in such establishments is treated as qualifying, provided that pension for service under a Port Fund is paid by the Port Fund, the rule of proportions being applied in the case of service paid partly from the Port Fund and partly from other sources.\n\n86. Subject to any provisions of law applicable to the case, the Local Government may allow the Trustees, Committee, or Managers of an Incorporated Local Fund to treat service paid therefrom as qualifying.\n\n87. Pensions for service paid from an Incorporated Local Fund must be paid from the Local Fund.\n\n88. In certain exceptional cases, service paid from Local Funds qualifies.\n\n89. Service paid from funds which Government holds only as a Trustee, such as under a Court of Wards or in an Attached Estate, does not qualify.\n90. (a) Service in an office paid only by fees whether levied by law or under the authority of Government, or by a commission, does not qualify.\n\n(b) Service in an office paid by fees or by commission, in addition to pay from the General Revenues, qualifies.\n\n91. Service paid by the grant, in accordance with law or custom, of a tenure in land, or of any other source of income, or right to collect money, does not qualify.\n\nSUPERIOR SERVICE.\n\nPERIODS OF LEAVE AND SUSPENSION.\n\n96. An Officer belonging to any of the Classes described in Schedule B, except Class III. (2) counts Furlough as service as follows:\n\nIf the service of the Officer He counts as service furlough for\nis not less than\n20 years ... ... ... 2 years\n25 \" \" \" 3 \"\n30 \" \" \" 4 \"\n35 \" \" \" 5 \"\n\nThis Section applies specially to Messrs. Schlich and Ribbentrop of the Forest Department.\n\n97. Otherwise time passed on Leave other than Privilege or Subsidiary Leave does not count as Superior Service. Time passed on Leave subsidiary to Leave on Medical Certificate by an Officer who has twice before had Leave on Medical Certificate out of India does not count.\n\n1. This Section applies to Leave on Medical Certificate taken even before 1856, notwithstanding that such Leave was reckoned as Service under the Old Pension Rules of the 4th of January, 1831.\n\n8. The Local Government may commute retrospectively periods of absence without leave into Leave without Allowances.\n\n99. Time passed under Suspension, pending inquiry into conduct, counts, if the suspension is immediately followed by re-instatement. Time passed under suspension adjudged as a specific penalty, does not count.\n\nFORFEITURE OF PAST SERVICE.\n\n100. An interruption in the service of an Officer entails forfeiture of his past service, except in the following cases:\n\n(a) Authorised Leave of Absence.\n\n(b) Unauthorised absence in continuation of authorised leave of absence, so long as the office of the Absentee is not substantively filled; if his office is substantively filled, the past service of the Absentee is forfeited:\n\nProvided that, if the Absentee is subsequently reinstated, the Authority whose duty it is to make the appointment, within three months, or, the Local Government, within one year, from the end of the authorised leave of absence, may declare, in an order to be communicated to the Accountant-General, that his previous service, or any part of it, shall not be forfeited.\n\n(c) Suspension immediately followed by re-instatement, which need not be to the same office.\n\n(d) Abolition of Office.\n\n(e) Transfer to non-qualifying service in an establishment under Government control. The transfer must be made by Competent Authority; an Officer who voluntarily resigns Qualifying Service, cannot claim the benefit of this exception. Transfer to a Grant-in-aid school entails forfeiture.\n\n(f) Transfer to service on the Household Establishment of the Viceroy.\n\n(g) Loss of appointment owing to the Mutiny, provided that the Officer affected cleared his character and was re-appointed as soon as a suitable vacancy was found for him.\n\n(h) Transit from one appointment to another, provided that the Officer is transferred under the orders of Competent Authority, or, if he is a Ministerial Officer with the consent of the Head of his old office.\n\n101. Resignation of the Public Service, or removal from it for misconduct, inefficiency, or failure to pass a prescribed examination, entails forfeiture of past service.\n\n1. Resignation of an appointment to take up another appointment, service in which counts, is not held to be a resignation of the Public Service.\n\n2. Any authority who, on revision or appeal, reverses an order dismissing an Officer, may declare that the past service of the reinstated Officer counts.\n\n3. An Officer who resigned the Public Service before the 8th June, 1863, if he was a Superior Servant, or before 1st September, 1871, if he was an Inferior Servant, and was re-appointed to the Public Service within twelve months from his resignation, counts his service rendered before resignation. This Rule can be applied to only one resignation.\n\n102. Upon such conditions as it may think fit, in each case, to impose:\n\n(a) The Government of India may condone all interruptions in service not exceeding twelve months in all; and the Local Government may condone all interruptions not exceeding three months in all.\n\n(b) If the proposed pension does not exceed fifty rupees a month, the Government of India may condone interruptions in service, whatever their duration; and the Local Government may exercise the same power if the pension is a provincial charge; otherwise it may condone interruptions not exceeding twelve months in all.\n\nCONDITIONS OF AWARD OF PENSION.\n\n103. Pensions are of four classes:\n\nCompensation Pensions.\nInvalid Pensions.\nSuperannuation Pensions.\nRetiring Pensions.\n\nA Gratuity is paid in a single sum, and not by instalments.\n\nCOMPENSATION PENSIONS.\n\n104. A Compensation Pension is awarded to an Officer discharged from the Public Service, because on a reduction of Establishment his appointment is abolished.\n\nINVALID PENSIONS.\n\n105. An Invalid Pension is awarded, on his retirement from the Public Service, to an Officer who, by bodily or mental infirmity, is permanently incapacitated\u2014\n\n(a) For the Public Service, or\n\n(b) For the particular branch of it to which he belongs.\n\n(1) An Officer discharged on other grounds has no claim under this Section, even although he can produce medical evidence of incapacity for service.\n\n107. If the Officer applying for pension is sixty years old or upwards, no Certificate by a Medical Officer is necessary; it suffices for the Head of the office to certify to the incapacity of the applicant. Otherwise incapacity for service must be established by a Medical Certificate.\n\n109. If the incapacity is the result of irregular or intemperate habits, no pension can be granted. Otherwise, it is for the Local Government to decide whether the Officer's incapacity is such as to render it necessary to admit him to Invalid Pension.\n\n1. An Officer who has submitted a Medical Certificate of incapacity for further service, must not (except for special reasons to be reported to the Local Government) be retained in active service pending a decision on his application for pension, nor can he obtain leave of absence. Without the further special sanction of the Local Government, service after the date of a Medical Certificate does not count for pension. The object of this Rule is to discourage tentative applications; but an Inferior Servant, or a Police Officer whose\npay does not exceed twenty rupees, and who, in the opinion of the Head of his Office, is fit for light work, may be retained in employment till his pension is sanctioned, provided that his place is not filled up till he retires, and that his service counts only to the date of his Medical Certificate.\n\nNote.\u2014This Rule refers only to the retention in active service of an officer who has furnished a medical certificate in support of an application for invalid pension or gratuity while in India. The retirement of an officer who is absent on leave when such certificate is submitted may have effect from the termination of his leave, and the officer may continue to draw leave allowance to the end of his leave.\n\nSuperannuation Pensions.\n\n110. A Superannuation Pension is granted to an Officer entitled or compelled, by Rule, to retire at a particular age.\n\n1. Except as provided in Rules I A and I B, an Officer in a Superior Grade who has attained the age of fifty-five years may be required to retire, unless the Local Government considers him efficient, and permits him to remain in the Service. But, as the premature retirement of an efficient Officer imposes a needless charge on the State, this Rule should be worked with discretion.\n\n2. Officers in the Survey of India, of rank not lower than that of Assistant Surveyor, shall cease to be in employment on attaining the age of fifty-five years, unless specially permitted by the Secretary of State, in the interests of the public service, to remain in the Department for a further definite period.\n\n3. After the age of fifty-five years a Civil Engineer in the Public Works Department, a Civilian in the Accounts Branch of that Department, or an officer in the Superior Branch of the Telegraph Department, shall not be appointed, either substantively or in an officiating capacity, to a grade other than that to which he may be attached at the time, nor permitted to continue in any grade, whether substantively or in an officiating capacity, to which he has been attached for five years and upwards, unless in any special case sanctioned by the Secretary of State. Nor can such an officer claim to retain any office for a longer period than may have been specially fixed by the Government of India (or Madras or Bombay, as the case may be), at the time of his appointment to the office.\n\nNote.\u2014The operation of the Rule in respect to Officers in the Superior Branch of the Telegraph Department should be postponed for two years from the 10th August, 1883, and no Officer shall be removed from the office held by him on the 10th August, 1883, by reason of the rule, until five years have expired from his first appointment to such office.\n\n4. The Accountant-General will inform the Local Government whenever any Officer attains the age of fifty-five years, in order that the Local Government, being apprised of the fact, may take such action as it sees fit for the retention or otherwise of the Officer in question.\n\n5. If an Officer, whose age is less than sixty years, is required to retire under Rule I, the head of his Office must certify the cause of the applicant's inefficiency. If the Officer wishes to retire of his own accord under Rule 5, the fact should be stated.\n\n6. An Officer in Superior Service, who has attained the age of fifty-five years, may, at his option, retire from the Service on a Superannuation Pension.\n\n7. (a) After the age of fifty-five years no Military or Naval Officer shall be appointed to a new office in civil employment, whether substantive or officiating; nor, except in special cases sanctioned by the Secretary of State, shall he be permitted to retain any such office which he has held for five years and upwards. Provided that a Military Officer employed in the Public Works Department cannot claim to retain any such office for a longer period than may have been specially fixed by the Government of India (or Madras or Bombay, as the case may be) at the time of his appointment to the office.\n\n[Note.\u2014This Rule should be strictly enforced, unless the retirement of any officer should be considered by the Government under which he is serving to be injurious to the public interest.]\n\nExceptions (1).\u2014Medical Officers of the Administrative grades in the Service, namely Surgeons-General and Deputy Surgeons-General, are not compelled to retire from the Service until they attain the age of sixty years. A Deputy-Surgeon-General who has not attained the age of sixty years may be appointed to be Surgeon-General either permanently or temporarily.\n\n(2). Medical officers of the rank of Surgeon-Major or Brigade-Surgeon who entered the Service prior to the 13th January, 1860, may, on attaining the age of fifty-five years, be allowed to retain their appointments in the Civil Department for a period not exceeding three years, if they are permitted to remain in the Medical Service under the provisions of Article 8 of the Royal Warrant of the 16th November, 1880.\n\n(b). The undermentioned officers cease to be in civil employment on attaining the age of fifty-five years:\n\n(i) Military Officers in the Survey of India, unless specially permitted by the Secretary of State, in the interests of the public service, to remain in the Department for a further definite period;\n\n(ii) Brigade Surgeons or Surgeons-Major, who entered the service on or after the 13th January, 1869; and\n\n(iii) All Warrant Officers, except Warrant Medical Officers, who on being reported to be qualified after examination as to fitness, shall be retained for a further period of three years.\n\nRetiring Pensions.\n\n111. A Retiring Pension is granted to an Officer who voluntarily retires after completing the requisite period of service.\n\nAmount of Pension.\n\n112. The amount of Pension that may be granted is determined by length of service, as set forth in Sections 113, 114, 115, and 116.\n\n(1) An Officer entitled to Pension may not take a Gratuity instead of Pension.\n\nFor Superior Service.\n\n113. Compensation and Invalid Pension may be granted for Superior Qualifying Service as follows:\n\n(a) After a service of not less than fifteen years:\n\nA Gratuity not exceeding (except in special cases and under the orders of the Government of India) One Month's Emoluments for each completed year of service or twelve months' Emoluments in all. If the Emoluments of the Officer have been reduced during the last five years of his service, otherwise than as a penalty, Average Emoluments may, at the discretion of the Local Government, be substituted for Emoluments.\n\n(b) After a service of not less than fifteen years, but less than twenty-five years:\n\nA Pension not exceeding one-third of Average Emoluments; and also, not exceeding Rs. 3,000 a year, or, if the Average Emoluments do not exceed Rs. 12,000 a year, Rs. 2,000 a year.\n\n(c) After a service of not less than twenty-five years:\n\nA Pension not exceeding one-half of Average Emoluments; and also, not exceeding Rs. 5,000 a year, or, if the Average Emoluments do not exceed Rs. 12,000 a year, Rs. 4,000 a year.\n\n[Note.\u2014The Proviso under Section 111 applies to an Officer invalided on account of incapacity for further service, which incapacity is due to old age or natural decay from advancing years. In the case of an Officer whose Qualifying Service began after he attained the age of twenty-five years, the attention of the Examining Medical Officer should always be called to that Proviso, in order that he may adapt his Certificate accordingly.]\n\n114. An Invalid Pension on the following Scale, but not being less than Rs. 1,000 or more than Rs. 2,000 a year, may be granted to an Officer belonging to any of Classes described in Schedule B, except Class III. The Government of India may, on special grounds, recommend for sanction by the Secretary of State the grant of an Invalid Pension on the same scale to an Officer belonging to Class III., provided that if he was not appointed by the Secretary of State, he be not of purely Asiatic descent.\nIf the qualifying service of the officer be not less than\u2014\n\n| Years | Parts of the officer's average emoluments |\n|-------|------------------------------------------|\n| 10    | 10                                       |\n| 11    | 11                                       |\n| 12    | 12                                       |\n| 13    | 13                                       |\n| 14    | 14                                       |\n\n115. The amount of Superannuation Pension which may be granted for Superior Qualifying Service is that which would be admissible as an Invalid Pension.\n\nProviso.\u2014If an Officer's Qualifying Service began after the 20th January, 1871, and after he attained the age of 25 years, the pension admissible under this Section is to be multiplied by a fraction, the denominator of which is 30 or, for Officers entitled to the benefit of Section 118 (a), 27, and the numerator the number of years' service completed, not exceeding 30, or, for Officers entitled to the benefits of Section 118 (a), 27. The limit of Rs. 2,000, Rs. 3,000, Rs. 4,000, or Rs. 5,000 is to be applied before, and not after, this multiplication.\n\n116. A Retiring Pension may be granted for Superior Qualifying Service as follows:\n\nAfter a service of not less than thirty years:\nThe same in amount as an Invalid Pension admissible after twenty-five years' service.\n\n117. In the following cases the several prescribed maximum limits of Rs. 2,000, Rs. 3,000, Rs. 4,000, and Rs. 5,000 a year may be relaxed.\n\n(a) For an Officer whose Average Emoluments exceed Rs. 10,000 a year, and who entered the Service before the 19th May, 1855, or whose salary, before the 6th August, 1862, exceeded Rs. 10,000 a year, the maximum pension is ordinarily Rs. 5,000 a year. But if the service of such an Officer has been of extraordinary merit, a pension exceeding Rs. 5,000 a year may be recommended for the sanction of the Secretary of State.\n\n(b) To an Officer who entered the Service before the 19th May, 1855, but whose Average Emoluments do not exceed Rs. 10,000 a year, the Secretary of State, on the recommendation of the Government of India, sometimes grants a Special Pension in excess of the prescribed maximum, for unusually meritorious services.\n\n(c) For a Native Judge who was in the service on the 29th October, 1866, the limit is ordinarily Rs. 5,000 a year.\n\n[Note.\u2014The limits which may be relaxed under the foregoing Rules are the maximum money limits, and not the limits of one-third or one-half Average emoluments.]\n\n118. In the following cases, certain privileges exist in respect of the length of service required for pension\u2014\n\n(a) To an Officer, not being a native of Asia, whose qualifying service began after twenty-five years of age, and whose whole service for which pension is claimed has been passed in one or other of the following offices, pension is admissible after three years' less service than is required from other Officers:\u2014\n\nDirectors of Public Instruction,\nInspectors of Schools,\nPrincipals and Professors of Colleges,\nHead-masters of Colleges and High Schools,\nBarristers serving in Offices other than those mentioned in Section 115 to which the Local Government has, with the consent of the Government of India, declared it to be necessary to appoint Barristers.\n\n[Note.\u2014The only office concerning which this declaration has been made is that of Deputy Superintendent and Remembrancer of Legal Affairs, Bengal.]\n\n(c) The Government of India may, in special cases, add a period, not exceeding three years, to the service of any Civil Engineer appointed to the Public Works Department before the 1st November, 1873, with initial rank higher than that of a First Grade Assistant Engineer. This concession will not, however, be granted to any Officer taken over, directly or indirectly, from one of the Guaranteed Railway Companies, who received a bonus on leaving the service of the Company.\n\n119. To the following officers, being Barristers and not being Covenanted Civil Servants, viz.:\u2014\n\nJudges of the Chief Court of the Punjab;\nFirst Judges of Small Cause Courts of Presidency towns;\nRecorder of Rangoon;\nSecretary to the Government of India in the Legislative Department.\n\nSpecial Pensions are admissible as follows:\u2014\n\n(a) After not less than six years and nine months' Active Service in one or other of the Offices specified in this Section,\u2014an Invalid Pension of \u00a3300 a year.\n\n(b) After not less than eight years and eight months such service,\u2014an Invalid Pension of \u00a3500 a year\n\n(c) After not less than eleven years and six months such service,\u2014a Retiring Pension of \u00a3750 a year\n\n1. Active Service here includes, besides time spent on duty, whether in substantive or acting service, Privilege Leave, Subsidiary Leave, and periods of vacation during which the Officer is not on Furlough or Extraordinary Leave.\n\n2. Except as provided by this Section, these Officers come under the ordinary Rules.\n\nMutiny Pensions.\n\n165. The widow of an Uncovenanted Officer, who receives a pension on account of her husband having been killed in the Mutiny, retains half her pension on re-marriage. Her half pension is not increased on second widowhood.\n\n168. A pension is payable in India monthly on the first day of the following month.\n\n(5) At the Home Treasury pensions are paid quarterly.\n\nPlace of Payment.\n\n172. A pension is payable as follows:\u2014\n\nI. If it is stated in Rupees\u2014\n(a) At any Treasury of the Government of India in India; or,\n\n(b) If the Pensioner is resident elsewhere than in Asia, at his option at the Home Treasury of the Government of India, at the rate of exchange fixed yearly for the adjustment of financial transactions between the Imperial and Indian Governments.\n\nII. If it is stated in Sterling\u2014\n(a) At the Home Treasury of the Government of India; or,\n\n(b) If the Pensioner is resident in Asia, at his option at any treasury of the Government of India in India, at the rate of exchange fixed yearly for the adjustment of financial transactions between the Imperial and Indian Governments.\n\n1. The Rule for the payment at the Home Treasury of a pension at the rate of exchange fixed yearly for the adjustment of financial transactions between the Imperial and Indian Governments, applies to an Officer under covenant, who is entitled by his covenant to pension in accordance with the Rules applicable to Uncovenanted Officers; the covenanted rate of exchange for his pay and allowances does not, unless it is expressly so stated, apply to his pension.\n\n174. Transfer of a Pension from the Home to an Indian Treasury is permitted whenever desired; but transfer of a Pension from an Indian to the Home Treasury is permitted only once.\nSCHEDULE B.\n\nOfficers who are entitled to certain special privileges.\n\n[See Sections 67, 68, 96, and 114.]\n\nI.

Saving as in any particular case specially so expressed, the Rules in this Code apply to all Public Officers as follows:\n\n(a) Lieutenant-Governors and Ordinary Members of the Council of the Governor General or of the Governor of Madras or Bombay ...\n(b) Judges of the High Court and (provided that they are Barristers and not Covenanted Civil Servants) Judges of the Chief Court of the Punjab, the Secretary to the Government of India in the Legislative Department, the Recorder of Rangoon and First Judges of Small Cause Courts of Presidency Towns ...\n(c) Covenanted Civil Servants, Military Officers subject to the Civil Rules, and Uncovenanted Officers belonging to one of the Classes enumerated in Schedule A, and appointed thereto by Her Majesty's Secretary of State, or with his particular sanction, or whose names are entered in Schedule B ...\n\nThe special Rules which apply to these Officers are contained in\u2014\n\nChapter III.\n\nIV.\n\nV.\n\n(1) The Officers whose names are entered in Schedule B were admitted to the benefits of the Rules in Chapter V. from the 3rd January, 1872, being the day on which the despatch from the Secretary of State, No. 451, dated 6th December, 1871, was received. The death, resignation, removal, or retirement of any of these Officers should be promptly reported by the Government, Department or Head of Office under whom he is serving, directly to the Government of India in the Department of Finance.\n\n(2) The conditions precedent to the entry of the name of an Officer in Schedule B were that\u2014\n\n(1) he was not of purely Asiatic descent,\n(2) he held substantively, on the 3rd January, 1872, one of the offices described in Schedule A; and\n(3) his salary, on the 10th February, 1876, was not less than six thousand rupees a year.\n\n(3) An Uncovenanted Officer to whom the Rules in Chapter V. are declared applicable, does not forfeit his privileges upon transfer to some office not included in Schedule A, unless such transfer is ordered as a penalty, or because of the Officer's inefficiency.\n\n(4) The Rules in Chapter V. which apply to an Uncovenanted Officer apply to an Officer of the Royal Navy attached to the Marine Survey Department. The leave admissible to such an Officer will be calculated with reference only to his service in India, and without any regard to his British service.\n\n(d) Native Civil Servants ...\n(e) Law Officers described in the prefixed note to Chapter VII., provided that they are not Covenanted Civil Servants ...\n(f) Bishops ...\n(g) Chaplains ...\n(h) Uncovenanted Officers excepting those specified in case (c) ...\n(i) The Bengal Covenanted Flot Service ...\n(k) The Police at Port Blair ...\n(m) Officers serving under Special Contracts ...\n\nTheir contracts.\nCHAPTER II.\n\nGENERAL RULES.\n\n3. The Government of India reserves to itself the full right of modifying the Rules in this Code as may from time to time seem to it expedient, and of interpreting these Rules in case of dispute. In all contracts for service in India to which the Secretary of State is a party, provision is made for the exercise by the Government of these rights.\n\n4. Leave of Absence can never be claimed absolutely, as of right. Nothing in this Code must be understood to limit the free discretion of the Government to refuse or revoke Leave of Absence of any description, at any time, according to the exigencies of the Public Service.\n\n1. If a Local Government, under this Section, refuse Furlough to a Member of the Bengal Covenanted Civil Service, it should report the refusal for the confirmation of the Government of India in the Home Department.\n\n[Note.\u2014The Local Government may refuse to grant the full amount of leave applied for in any case, and should by the exercise of this power so regulate the date of an officer's return from leave as to cause as little change as possible in administrative arrangements.]\n\n5. (a) An Officer recalled to duty before the expiry of leave of any kind is entitled to take the balance of his leave, together with any leave of the same kind subsequently earned, as soon as he can be spared from duty.\n\n[Note.\u2014Time occupied in the voyage to India on recall from recognised leave out of India is not included in the balance of leave.]\n\n(b) An Officer recalled to duty before the expiry of any recognised leave out of India is entitled to free passage to India and actual personal travelling expenses from the port of embarkation in India to the Station to which he is posted;\n\n[Note.\u2014During the voyages to and from India Leave Allowances only are granted.]\n\n(c) An Officer recalled to duty before the expiry of leave in India, other than Privilege Leave, is treated as on duty from the date on which he starts for the Station to which he is ordered, and is entitled to his actual personal travelling expenses on his journey to the Station to which he is posted.\n\n(d) An Officer recalled to duty from Privilege Leave is entitled to no concession except that mentioned in Clause (a).\n\n6. If an Officer while absent on Leave during which the amount of his Leave Allowances depends upon the substantive or officiating rank or appointment which he would hold if present on duty, obtains promotion, substantive or officiating, or an increase of Pay or Acting Allowance which involves no change in, or addition to, his duties or responsibilities, the promotion or increase has effect at once. Otherwise the promotion of an absent Officer has effect only from the date of his return to duty.\n\n7. An Officer who is discharged from, or resigns, the Public Service, and is re-employed after an interval, cannot, without the sanction of the Government of India, count his service before discharge towards leave after re-employment.\n\nException.\u2014An Officer discharged from the Indian Navy on its abolition, and subsequently re-employed, may count his Naval Service towards leave after re-employment, notwithstanding the occurrence of a moderate interval between his discharge from the Indian Navy and his first re-employment. Any leave taken by such Officer while in the Indian Navy, will be treated, in calculating the leave due to him under this Rule, as if such leave had been taken under the Rules to which he became subject on re-employment.\n\n8. Service as Private Secretary to the Governor-General or a Governor qualifies, provided that the Officer belongs to the Covenanted Civil Service or to the Staff Corps, or belonged (before his appointment as Private Secretary) to the Uncovenanted Service.\n\n13. Subject to the Provisions of Section 55, if an Officer makes over charge of his Office before noon, his leave begins on and includes the day on which he makes over charge; otherwise, it begins on and includes the following day.\n\n1. If the absence of the Officer does not involve the immediate deputation of any Officer from another Station, or any formal transfer of charge in the way of taking over money, or the like, then the Absentee may leave his Station at the close of the last day on which the Office is open for business before his leave begins. In such case the several transfers of charge dependent upon the departure of the Absentee shall take effect from the close of the last working day aforesaid. But, subject to the provisions of Section 55, the leave of the Absentee and the re-arrangement of allowances, if any, depending upon his departure, shall begin from, and include, the first day thereafter on which the Office is open for business. The actual date of the Officer's departure from his Station must, however, always be reported.\n\n17. The following are the Rules for regulating the allowances of Public Officers who are deputed on special duty to Europe, or who are detained on duty in Europe\u2014\n\nI. A Military Officer in military employ, who is permitted to proceed to Europe for the purpose of acquiring professional information, or is deputed on special duty to Europe, receives, during the period of his absence from India, the full Indian Pay and Allowances of his rank and half staff salary.\n\nII. A Civil Officer, or a Military Officer in civil employ, who, with the Sanction of the Secretary of State, is deputed to Europe on special civil duty, is entitled, from the date on which he makes over charge of his office in India to the date on which he resumes it, to an allowance not exceeding two-thirds of the amount which he would draw were he on duty in India.\n\n[Note.\u2014Under very special circumstances, the Secretary of State may relax this Rule.]\n\nIII. A Civil Officer, or a Military Officer in civil employ, who, under the orders of the Secretary of State, is detained in Europe on civil duty, or permitted to remain on special civil duty, beyond the period of his leave, is entitled\n\n(a) If on any leave other than Privilege leave\u2014to an allowance not exceeding two-thirds of his pay and allowance in India,\n\n(b) If on Privilege leave\u2014to an allowance not exceeding half his pay and allowances in India, for the period during which he is so detained or permitted to remain on special civil duty,\nCHAPTER III.\n\nLIEUTENANT-GOVERNORS AND MEMBERS OF COUNCIL.\n\n18. Leave on Medical Certificate for not more than six months may be granted to a Lieutenant-Governor. On resuming his duties after such Leave, a Lieutenant-Governor is entitled to half his salary for the period of his absence. If he is prevented from resuming his duties he is entitled to no Absentee Allowances. A Lieutenant-Governor is not entitled to any other Leave.\n\n19. The leave admissible to an Ordinary Member of the Executive Council of the Governor-General, or of the Governor of Madras or Bombay, is regulated by Act of Parliament, Section 26 of 24 & 25 Vic., cap. 67, as follows:\n\nSection 26 of 24 & 25 Vic., cap. 67. It shall be lawful for the Governor-General in Council, or Governor in Council of either of the Presidencies, as the case may be, to grant to an Ordinary Member of Council, Leave of Absence, under Medical Certificate, for a period not exceeding six months, and such Member, during his absence, shall retain his Office, and shall, on his return and resumption of his duties, receive half his salary for the period of such absence; but, if his absence shall exceed six months, his Office shall be vacated.\n\n1. Subject to any special orders by the Government of India to the contrary,\n\nLeave of absence granted to an ordinary Member of the Council of the Governor General (if taken out of India) commences on the day after such Member embarks at Bombay or Calcutta, and ends the day before he disembarks at either of these ports: Provided always that such Member has not been relieved of the charge of his office until he embarks, and that he resumes charge immediately upon his disembarkation:\n\nAnd the tenure by a Member of Council of his office begins when he takes his seat in Council under the usual salute, and the resignation of his office by a Member of Council whose successor has not entered upon his office, takes effect from the day following that of his embarkation at Bombay or Calcutta, or from the expiry of his five years' tenure of office, whichever date is earlier.\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nJUDGES OF HIGH COURTS AND CERTAIN LEGAL AND JUDICIAL OFFICERS.\n\nRegulations by the Secretary of State in Council of India under the provisions of 24 & 25 Victoria, Cap. 104, Section 6, respecting the furloughs of the Chief Justices and Puisne Judges of the High Courts of Judicature, for the Bengal Division of the Presidency of Fort William, Madras, Bombay and the North-Western Provinces; and Regulations by the Secretary of State in Council respecting the furloughs and leaves of absence of certain other Legal and Judicial Officers.\n\nDEFINITIONS.\n\n20. In the following Rules \"Actual Service\" includes\u2014\n\n(1) Time spent on duty as a Judge or Officiating Judge of a High Court.\n(2) Privilege Leave of Absence.\n(3) Subsidiary Leave of Absence.\n(4) Duly authorised Vacations, provided that the Judge is not absent on Furlough or Extraordinary Leave.\n\n\"Native Judge\" in the rules in this chapter means a Native of India (not being a Member of the Covenanted Civil Service appointed by the Secretary of State for India after competitive examination in England), who received his permanent appointment as Judge of a High Court after the 21st May, 1881.\n\n\"Extraordinary Leave\" means any leave granted otherwise than under these Rules.\n\nFURLOUGH AND SUBSIDIARY LEAVE.\n\n21. One year's Furlough shall be placed to the credit of each Judge, after the completion of every four years of Actual Service.\n\n22. Except under Sections 25 and 26 no furlough shall be granted until at credit under Section 21.\n\nProvided that any Judge who may have been already in the service of the Government at the time of taking office in the High Court, and who was, at that time, entitled under the Rules applicable to the branch of the Service to which he belonged, to Furlough, without Medical Certificate, may be granted Furlough for a term not exceeding that to which he was so entitled, upon the condition that such Furlough shall not be taken until the completion of two years Actual Service in the High Court, and shall not exceed one year.\n\n23. Except under Section 26, Furlough shall not be repeated until after the completion of three years' Actual Service from the date of the last return from Furlough or Extraordinary Leave.\n\nN.B. The words \"Furlough,\" or \"Extraordinary Leave,\" in the foregoing Section mean Furlough under these Rules, or Extraordinary Leave granted to any Officer since he has been a Chief Justice or Judge of a High Court.\n\n24. The maximum term of Furlough to be taken at any one time shall be fifteen months.\n\n25. Under Medical Certificate, Furlough may be granted before it is at credit under Section 21.\n\n26. On Urgent Private Affairs, Furlough may be granted to a Judge before it is at credit under Section 21, and although three years of Actual Service have not been completed since the last return from Furlough or Extraordinary Leave.\n\nProvided that Furlough under this Section shall not exceed six months, and shall be granted only once during the whole period of a Judge's service in the High Court.\n\n27. The aggregate amount of all Furlough which can be granted to a Judge, other than a Native Judge, during the whole period of his service in the High Court is two years and a half. Such aggregate amount in the case of a Native Judge is two years.\n\n28. Furlough taken in India shall be reckoned from the date of the Judge's quitting his Office to the date of his return thereto. Furlough taken out of India shall be reckoned from the date of embarkation to the date of debarkation.\n\nIn the event of the Furlough being taken partly in India and partly out of India, the commencement and termination of the Furlough shall be respectively determined by the foregoing Rules, according as the Furlough begins or ends in or out of India.\n\n29. For the interval elapsing between the date of quitting his Office and the commencement of Furlough out of India, and between the termination of Furlough out of India and resuming his Office, a Judge may be allowed Subsidiary Leave not ordinarily exceeding thirty days, which, in special cases, may be extended.\n30. A Judge, other than a Native Judge, when on Furlough or Subsidiary Leave, shall receive allowances at the rate of Rs. 332-5-6 per mensem in the case of Leave taken in India, or \u00a31,000 per annum in the case of Leave taken out of India.\n\n31. A Native Judge, when on Furlough, either in or out of India, or on Subsidiary Leave, shall receive allowances at the rate of Rs. 700 a month.\n\n32. Except under Medical Certificate, the number of Furloughs to be granted at any one time, and the grant of Furlough to individual Judges shall be subject to, and limited by, the exigencies of the Service, which exigencies shall be determined exclusively by the Authority granting the Furlough.\n\n33. If, owing to the exigencies of the Service, it may be necessary to place any limit on the number of Judges who may be absent on Furlough at the same time, applications not supported by Medical Certificate will be granted in the following order:\n\nThe Judge to whose credit the greatest amount of Furlough remains under Section 21 shall have the preference.\n\nIf two or more Applicants are on an equality in this respect, the preference shall be given to the applicant whose actual service in a High Court is longest, reckoning, in the case of a Judge who has not taken Furlough or Extraordinary Leave, from the date of his commencement of service in the High Court, and, in the case of a Judge who has taken Furlough or Extraordinary Leave, from the date of his last return from such Furlough or Leave.\n\nIf two or more Applicants are equal in both respects, the preference shall be given to the senior in the Court.\n\nPrivilege Leave.\n\n34.\u2014(a) Subject to the exigencies of the Public Service, a Judge, who has completed eleven months' continuous duty including the Vacation, may take Privilege Leave for one month in each year; but, except as provided in Clause (b), his salary will cease during such Leave. A Judge may not take Privilege Leave in instalments, or more than a month at once; and, except as provided in Clause (c), Privilege Leave may not be combined with the Vacation.\n\n(b) A Judge who is detained on duty as Vacation-Judge, may, during his next Privilege Leave, draw his salary for any period by which his vacation, consequently, falls short of one month.\n\n(c) Once in three years, and not oftener, Privilege Leave, during which full salary is drawn under Clause (b), may be prefixed or affixed to the Vacation.\n\n35. Section 34 does not apply to those Judges (23 in number) who were in office on the date of the publication of that Rule.\n\n36. Privilege Leave may be granted to any of the Officers referred to in Section 35, under the following Rules:\n\n(1) Subject to the exigencies of the Public Service, Privilege Leave for one month may be granted to a Judge who has been on duty, without interruption, for eleven months, including the Vacation.\n\n(2) An additional month of Privilege Leave accrues to a Judge after each further period of eleven months' continuous duty including the Vacation.\n\n(3) Privilege Leave may not be taken in instalments; but any balance of Privilege Leave not taken when due may be added to the next Privilege Leave which accrues;\n\nProvided that the whole Privilege Leave taken at one time shall not exceed three months, and that any accumulation of Privilege Leave beyond that period shall be forfeited.\n\n(4) Saving as provided in Rule (5), a Judge, when on Privilege Leave, shall receive half his salary.\n\n(5) A Judge who discharges the duties of Vacation-Judge, during the whole or any part of a Vacation, shall be entitled, for each day of such duty, to draw his full salary for one day of any Privilege Leave which he may subsequently obtain.\n\n36a. A Judge applying for privilege leave (whether the leave be under Section 34 or Section 36) must record a declaration that he has no intention of resigning his office, or of taking leave of any kind for three months after his return to duty. Though not absolutely debarred by this declaration from applying for permission to resign his office and retiring from the service, or to take leave within three months, he should, if he does so, explain his change of intention.\n\nGeneral.\n\n37. Furlough and Privilege Leave shall not be taken as such, in continuation of each other; but if a Judge absent on one of these classes of Leave be allowed to change it for another, the whole period of his absence shall be held to be under the class of Leave for which it was changed.\n\n38. Applications for Leave shall in all cases be submitted in such manner as the Government may, from time to time, prescribe.\n\n39. Leave Allowances shall be payable monthly if payment is taken in India, and quarterly if payment is taken in England.\n\n40. No substantive appointment shall be vacated, merely by reason of Leave being granted under these Rules.\n\n41. If a Judge shall overstay any Leave, he shall forfeit all salary during the time of his remaining so absent, and if he shall so continue absent for more than one week, his office shall be liable to become vacant. This Rule shall not operate to oblige any Judge taking leave, other than leave under Section 34, to return to duty on an authorised holiday, unless an Officer is officiating as Judge in consequence of his absence.\n\n42. No Leave, except Privilege Leave and Leave Subsidiary to Furlough shall count as service for pension.\n\n43. If a Judge, who is a Covenanted Civil Servant or a Native Civil Servant, shall be permitted to resign his office and remain in the service, all Leave which he may have taken as a Judge of the High Court shall be reckoned as if it had been taken under the Rules for the Leave of Absence of Covenanted Civil Servants, or Native Civil Servants, as the case may be.\n\n44. The foregoing Rules regarding Furlough and Leave of absence (Sections 20 to 43), are, with the modifications A and B below stated, applicable also to the following Officers, provided that they were before their appointment practising Barristers of England or Ireland, or practising Members of the Faculty of Advocates of the Court of Session of Scotland, Judges of the Chief Court of the Punjab, Recorders in Rangoon, First Judges of Small Cause Courts at Presidency Towns.\n\nSecretary to the Government of India in the Legislative Department.\n\nModifications indicated above.\n\n(A) The Allowances of these Officers, while on Furlough or Subsidiary Leave, shall not exceed half their salaries, and shall be limited also to the rate prescribed in Section 30.\n\n(B) The Privilege Leave of the Secretary to the Government of India in the Legislative Department, the First Judge of the Small Cause Court at Calcutta, and of the Judges of the Chief Court of the Punjab shall be regulated by Sections 71 to 76.\nCHAPTER V.\n\nCOVENANTED CIVIL SERVANTS NOT BEING NATIVE CIVIL SERVANTS; MILITARY OFFICERS SUBJECT TO CIVIL RULES; AND UNCOVENANTED OFFICERS BELONGING TO ONE OF THE CLASSES ENUMERATED IN SCHEDULE A AND APPOINTED THERETO BY HER MAJESTY'S SECRETARY OF STATE, OR WITH HIS PARTICULAR SANCTION, OR WHOSE NAMES ARE ENTERED IN SCHEDULE B.\n\nGENERAL.\n\n45. No Leave but Privilege Leave may be granted to a Covenanted Civil Servant who has completed thirty-five years' service, or to a Military Officer in Civil Employ, whether subject to Civil Rules or to Military Rules, who is more than fifty-five years old. Any Leave other than Privilege Leave granted to a Covenanted Civil Servant before such date ceases to have effect on such date, and any Leave other than Privilege Leave granted in the Civil Department to a Military Officer in Civil Employ before he is fifty-five years old ceases to have effect on his fifty-fifth birthday, on which date he reverts to Military Employ. The absentee allowances of a Military Officer in Civil Employ on Leave other than Privilege Leave become a Military Charge, and he becomes subject to Military Rules on his fifty-fifth birthday, whether his Leave was granted in the Military or the Civil Department.\n\n[Note.\u2014In applying this Section to Medical Officers of the Administrative Grades in the Service, namely, Surgeons-General, and Deputy Surgeons-General \"sixty,\" or \"sixtieth,\" as the case may be, should be substituted for the words \"fifty-five\" or \"fifty-fifth\" in the Section.]\n\n46. An Uncovenanted Officer is eligible, after he attains the age of fifty-five years, for Privilege Leave, and also for any Special Leave (Sections 61 and 130) to which he may be otherwise entitled, and for no other kind of Leave. Any Leave, other than Privilege Leave or Special Leave, granted to an Uncovenanted Officer before the date on which he attains the age of fifty-five years, ceases to have effect on that date.\n\nFURLough.\n\n[Note.\u2014The Local Government in the Civil Department may grant Furlough in India under Military Rules to a Military Officer subject to Military Rules who is entitled to Furlough under Chapter I. of the Rules published by G.G.O. in Military Department, No. 171, dated 25th February, 1874. Such Furlough should be granted only upon a Certificate by the Government in the Military Department of the Presidency to which the Officer belongs, that he is entitled thereto; and a copy of the Order granting the Furlough should be sent to that Government.\n\nA Local Government may not, in the Civil Department, grant Furlough out of India under Military Rules to any Military Officer subject to Military Rules.]\n\n47. The amount of Furlough admissible to a Covenanted Civil Servant, or a Military Officer subject to Civil Rules and the aggregate amount of Furlough and of Special Leave With Allowances, admissible to an Uncovenanted Officer, is limited to six years. All the Rules in this Code are subject to this limitation.\n\nExplanation.\u2014The following Leave under other Rules is counted as Furlough under this Section.\n\nIn the case of a Covenanted Civil Servant:\u2014Furlough and Leave with Allowances on Medical Certificate under former Rules.\n\n(1) Leave of the kind described in Definition \"Active Service\" (h), and Junior Furlough under the Rules in force before the 8th June, 1855, are not counted against an Officer under this Section.\n\n[Note.\u2014Junior Furlough was Medical Leave, involving loss of appointment taken before completion of three years' residence.]\n\nIn the case of a Military Officer subject to Civil Rules:\u2014Furlough under Rules 1 and 6 of the Military Furlough and Leave Rules of 1875.\n\nIn the case of an Uncovenanted Officer:\u2014Furlough and Leave With Allowances on Medical Certificate, and Leave on Private Affairs under former Rules, or under the Rules in Chapter X.\n\n48. The amount of Furlough \"earned\" by an Officer is one-fourth of his Active Service.\n\n1. Leave of the kind described in Definition \"Active Service\" (h) counts as Active Service under this Section.\n\nProviso.\u2014(i) Provided that, in making this calculation for an Uncovenanted Officer, only half of the Active service rendered by him in offices other than those included in Schedule A shall be taken into account.\n\n1. The whole of the Active Service rendered by the Officer while officiating in any of the offices included in Schedule A is to be taken into account.\n\n(ii) Provided also, that a Military Officer subject to Civil Rules may add to the furlough he may earn under Civil Rules, the proportion of furlough which, under Military Rules, would have become due to him for his service previous to the date from which he is entitled to count Active Service under the Rules in this Code.\n\n49. The amount of Furlough \"due\" to an Officer is the amount which he has earned, diminished by\u2014\n\nIn the case of a Covenanted Civil Servant:\u2014\n\n(1) The Furlough which he has enjoyed under these or any former Rules, except Junior Furlough under the Rules in force before the 8th June 1855;\n\n(2) The excess over one year in the amount of Leave with Allowances, on Medical Certificate which he has enjoyed under former Rules.\n\nIn the case of a Military Officer subject to Civil Rules:\u2014\n\n(3) The Furlough which he has enjoyed under the Rules of this Code, or Rules 1 and 6 of the Military Furlough and Leave Rules of 1875.\n\nIn the case of an Uncovenanted Officer:\u2014\n\n(4) The Furlough, or Special Leave, with Allowances, which he has enjoyed under these or any other Rules;\n\n(5) The Leave on Private Affairs or on Medical Certificate with Allowances, which he has enjoyed under the Rules formerly applicable to him.\n\nProviso.\u2014Provided that if more than two years' Furlough be due to an Uncovenanted Officer when he first becomes subject to these Rules, the excess shall be cancelled.\n\n50. To an Officer who has rendered three years' Continuous Service, Furlough for not more than two years may be granted, as follows:\n\nOn Medical Certificate,\u2014unconditionally;\n\nWithout Medical Certificate,\u2014subject to these provisos:\u2014(1) That the Furlough be due to him; (2) that he have rendered eight years' Active Service; (3) that the whole number of Officers absent on Furlough and Special Leave do not exceed the limit (if any) appointed by the Government of India.\n\n1. Except on Medical Certificate, or on very Urgent Private Affairs, Furlough or Special Leave may not be granted to any Covenanted Civil Servant or to any Military Officer subject to Civil Rules, or to any Uncovenanted Officer who is, if employed in Oudh, the Central Provinces, British Burma, Assam, Ajmir, Coorg, and Berar, a Member of the Commission, or who is, if employed elsewhere, the holder of an office corresponding to that of a Member of a Commission, if one-fifth of all the Officers of a Commission, or of\nall Officers holding appointments similar to those of Members of a Commission, as the case may be, are already absent on Furlough or Special Leave.\n\n51. Furlough granted under Section 50 may, on Medical Certificate, be extended to not more than three years.\n\n52. To an Officer who has not rendered three years' Continuous Service, Furlough for not more than one year may be granted on Medical Certificate.\n\n53. Furlough granted under Section 52 for less than one year may, on Medical Certificate, be extended to not more than one year.\n\n54. (a) Subject to his good conduct and efficiency, an Officer on Ordinary Furlough, has a Lien on his substantive appointment, or on a substantive appointment of a like character and not less pay.\n\nExplanation.\u2014Ordinary Furlough includes\u2014\n(1) The first two years of each separate period of Furlough under Section 50, including any extension under Section 51;\n1. Ordinary Furlough can, under no circumstances extend beyond two years at one time.\n(2) So much of Furlough under Section 52, including any extension under Section 53, as may be due: Provided that the Officer have rendered six months' Continuous Active Service.\n(b) On Other Furlough a Covenanted Civil Servant, or a Military Officer subject to Civil Rules, has no Lien; but an Unconvenanted Officer has a Lien.\n(3) An Officer on Furlough has no claim to substantive promotion, but there is no objection to such promotion.\n(5) An Officer cannot obtain Ordinary Furlough or retain allowances under Section 57, unless he has a substantive appointment. A Military Officer who has no substantive Civil appointment continues subject to Military Rules, and can only get Military Furlough Allowances.\n\n55. Saving as provided in Section 67, Furlough and Special Leave out of India begin on and include the day of the departure of the vessel in which the Officer sails, and end on and include the day before the arrival of the vessel in which the Officer returns.\n\nDefinition.\u2014The day on which the vessel in which the officer sails quits her moorings or anchorage whether she leaves the limits of the port or not on that day is the day of the departure of the vessel. The day of arrival of the vessel in which the officer returns, is the day on which the vessel reaches her moorings or anchorage in port.\n\n1. An Officer may leave India, or return to India, by any port; but his Furlough or Special Leave begins on the vessel's departure from the port where he first meets it, and ends on the day before its arrival at the port where he last quits it.\n\nExemption.\u2014The Furlough or Special Leave of an Officer sailing from Calcutta in a vessel which touches at Madras, begins on the departure of the vessel from Calcutta, and not from Madras.\n\n2. An Officer serving in Persia or Arabia may leave the country in which he is serving, or return to it, by any port or frontier town except Aden. The date of his departure or return must be certified by the British Consul, or, if there be no British Consul, by the Officer himself.\n\n3. An Officer taking Furlough or Special Leave out of India must report his embarkation to the Local Government which granted his leave, and his arrival in England to the Secretary of State.\n\n56. An Officer is not entitled, at the end of Furlough or Special Leave, or Subsidiary Leave affixed thereto, to resume, as a matter of course, without further orders, the particular appointment which he vacated before his Furlough or Special Leave. He should report his return to duty in the manner prescribed in Section 165, Rule 6, and await orders.\n\n57. An Officer on Ordinary Furlough is entitled, subject to the limitations prescribed in Sections 58 and 59, to a Leave Allowance equal to half his Average Salary.\n\n58. The Maximum Leave Allowance of a Covenanted Civil Servant or a Military Officer subject to Civil Rules, on Ordinary Furlough is, if paid at the Home Treasury of the Government of India, \u00a3250 a quarter; if paid in India Rs. 833\u00bd a month. The minimum is, if paid at the Home Treasury, \u00a3125 a quarter; or his last salary, whichever is less; if paid in India, Rs. 416\u00bd a month, or his last salary, whichever is less.\n\n59. The Maximum Leave Allowance of an Unconvenanted Officer on Ordinary Furlough is, if paid at the Home Treasury of the Government of India, \u00a3200 a quarter; if paid in India, Rs. 666\u00bd a month. There is no minimum.\n\n1. An Officer on Furlough does not forfeit his past Leave Allowances by resigning the service without returning to India.\n\n60. An Officer on Furlough other than Ordinary, is entitled, if a Covenanted Civil Servant, or a Military Officer subject to Civil Rules, to Subsistence Allowance; if an Unconvenanted Officer, to \u00a3120 a quarter paid at the Home Treasury, or Rs. 400 a month paid in India, or to one quarter of his Average Salary, whichever is less.\n\n1. The following are the rates of monthly Subsistence Allowance for a Covenanted Civil Servant or a Military Officer subject to Civil Rules:\u2014\n\nTo an Officer of not more than eight years' actual residence in India. Rs. 250\nTo an Officer of more than eight but less than twelve years' actual residence in India ... ... ... 320\nTo an Officer of twelve or more years' actual residence in India ... ... ... 400\n\nNote.\u2014The Monthly Subsistence Allowance of a Native Civil Servant when out of employ is as follows:\u2014\n\nTo an Officer who has rendered not more than eight years' Active Service ... ... ... Rs. 250\nTo an Officer who has rendered more than eight, but less than twelve years' Active Service ... ... ... 320\nTo an Officer who has rendered not less than twelve years' Active Service ... ... ... 400\n\nSPECIAL LEAVE.\n\n61. Special Leave on Urgent Private Affairs may be granted at any time for not more than six months: Provided that an Officer who has had Special Leave must render six years' active service before he can again have such Leave.\n\n(1) The corresponding Leave under the Covenanted Civil Service Leave Rules in force before the 1st July, 1868, is \"Special Leave\" within the meaning of this proviso. Furlough under Rules XI and XXV. of the Military Furlough Rules of 1868, corresponds to \"Special Leave\" under this section.\n\n(2) An Unconvenanted Officer is not debarred from obtaining Special Leave with allowances under this Chapter by reason of his having had Leave on Private Affairs under the Rules in Chapter X., which is Furlough in another form.\n\n62. An Officer on Special Leave has a lien on his Substantive appointment, or on a Substantive appointment of a like character and not less pay, as if he were on Ordinary Furlough.\n\n63. For the first six months for which an Officer is on Special Leave, whether the six months be included in the same Leave or not, he is entitled to the Leave Allowance admissible under Sections 57, 58, and 59. Thereafter he is entitled to no Leave Allowance.\n\n(1) The corresponding Leave under the Covenanted Civil Service Leave Rules in force before the 1st July, 1868, is \"Special Leave\" within the meaning of this Section.\nSUBSIDIARY LEAVE.\n\n64*.\u2014(a) Subsidiary Leave is the time allowed\u2014\n\n(1) To an Officer leaving India, on retiring from the Service, or on Furlough or Special Leave, to break up his domestic establishment and travel to the port of embarkation, and\n\n(2) To an Officer returning to India from Furlough or Special Leave, to travel from the port of embarkation and re-organise his domestic establishment.\n\nNote.\u2014The use of the words, \"port of embarkation\" and \"port of disembarkation\" limits the grant of Subsidiary Leave to an Officer leaving India by sea, that is at an Indian sea-port. No Subsidiary Leave is admissible to an Officer who does not leave India by sea.\n\nb) The grant to an Officer leaving India\u2014\n\n(1) Of permission to retire from the Service, or\n\n(2) Of Furlough or Special Leave out of India, carries with it the grant of Subsidiary Leave, including, in Case (2), Subsidiary Leave on his return to duty.\n\n65.* The minimum Subsidiary Leave is ten days; otherwise Subsidiary Leave is calculated as Joining Time is calculated. (Section 160, Rule 2.)\n\nNote.\u2014All the provisions to Rule 2 under Section 160 apply equally in the case of Subsidiary Leave.\n\n66.* If an Officer eventually fails to obtain the medical certificate required by Section 79, Rule 11 or 14, he is entitled to Joining Time from the date on which the decision of the Medical Board or Officer is communicated to him, to enable him to return to his appointment. During this Joining Time, his allowances are regulated as if he was on Subsidiary Leave.\n\n67.* An Officer may take Furlough or Special Leave, partly in, and partly out, of India. But Subsidiary Leave is not admissible unless the Furlough or Special Leave begins, or, as the case may be, ends, as Furlough or Special Leave out of India.\n\nProviso.\u2014If an Officer going on Furlough or Special Leave out of India, is prevented by sickness or other urgent and adequate reason not within his own control, such, for example, as the postponement of the departure of the vessel in which his passage is engaged, from embarking within his Subsidiary Leave, the Local Government may order that his Furlough or Special Leave shall begin in India at the end of his Subsidiary Leave, without forfeiture of his Subsidiary Leave.\n\n1. *In the absence of such special order, if an Officer remains in India after the end of Subsidiary Leave, his Furlough or Special Leave dates from the beginning of his Subsidiary Leave.\n\n2. \u2020An Officer returning to India, without the permission of the authority which granted him Leave, more than fourteen days before the end of his Furlough or Special Leave, is not entitled to Subsidiary Leave, save under the special orders of the Local Government.\n\n68. An Officer on Subsidiary Leave under Section 64 (a), (1), has, or has not, a lien on an appointment according as he has, or has not, such lien on the first day of the leave to which it is subsidiary.\n\nNote.\u2014A Military Officer subject to Military Rules does not lose his lien during Subsidiary Leave preparatory to Furlough.\n\n69. An Officer on Subsidiary Leave under Section 64(a), (2), has, or has not, a lien on an appointment according as he has, or has not, such lien on the day last preceding the Subsidiary Leave.\n\n70. An Officer on Subsidiary Leave is entitled to allowances as follows:\u2014\n\n(a) If the leave be Subsidiary to Special Leave and the Officer have had leave subsidiary to a former Special Leave: no allowance.\n\n(b) If the leave be subsidiary to Ordinary Furlough or Special Leave:\u2014the allowance admissible under Section 57, but calculated, in the case of a Covenanted Civil Servant, or a Military Officer subject to Civil Rules, without the limitations of Maximum or Minimum prescribed by Section 58. The limitations prescribed by Section 59, apply to the allowances of an Uncovenanted Officer on Subsidiary Leave.\n\n(c) If the Leave be Subsidiary to Furlough other than Ordinary, the allowance admissible under Section 60.\n\n(d) If the Officer, under Section 165, have ceased to have a lien on a substantive appointment\u2014as, for example, if a Covenanted Officer has been absent on Extraordinary Leave in extension of Furlough\u2014in the case of a Covenanted Civil Servant, or a Military Officer subject to Civil Rules:\u2014Subsistence Allowance; and, in the case of an Uncovenanted Officer:\u2014no allowance.\n\n(e) If the leave be preparatory to retirement, the allowances which would be admissible if the officer were proceeding on leave of such description as may be admissible to him. And if no leave is admissible, subsistence allowance only.\n\n(28) (Financial Department No. 2429, dated 25th July, 1884.\u2014(19) No. 1346, dated 30th May, 1884.)\n\n1. *An Officer may draw allowances as if he were on Privilege Leave for any part of his Subsidiary Leave under Section 64 (a), (1), for which, if he were not retiring from the Service, or going on Furlough or Special Leave, Privilege Leave would be admissible to him. It is to be observed that an Officer who has no lien on an appointment cannot benefit by this Rule (see Rule 3 under Section 76).\n\nPRIVILEGE LEAVE.\n\n[The Rules in this Chapter apply to Military Officers subject to Military Rules.]\n\n71. The amount of Privilege Leave admissible at one time is limited to three calendar months.\n\n72. The amount of Privilege Leave earned by an Officer is one-eleventh part of the time during which he has been on duty without interruption: Provided that no Privilege Leave can be earned by an Officer by duty done, while three months' such leave is due to him, and that, whenever duty is interrupted, all claim to Privilege Leave earned theretofore is forfeited. Absence on Privilege Leave, though not counting as duty, is not an interruption of duty within the meaning of this Section.\n\n1. The calculation must be made as follows:\u2014One calendar month for every eleven complete calendar months of duty, and one day for every eleven days of the balance.\n\n4. \"Examination Leave\" may, if the Examination for which it is granted be successfully passed, or unless the Officer has already had twelve months' Examination Leave, count as duty qualifying for Privilege Leave. \"Examination Leave\" does not interrupt duty within the meaning of this Section, unless in the case of leave granted under Clauses (c) and (d) of Rule 1 in Section 77, the Officer fails to pass the Examination for which the Leave is granted.\n\n73. The Privilege Leave due to an Officer is the Privilege Leave which he has earned, less the period during which he has been absent on Privilege Leave.\n\n1. Privilege Leave is not admissible to\u2014\n\n(a.) Officers serving in Departments in which regular vacations are allowed, during which the officers are permitted to be absent from duty (e.g., Uncovenanted\n\n* Applies to a Military Officer subject to Military Rules.\n\n\u2020 Applies to all Officers, including Military Officers subject to Military Rules.\nJudicial Officers, Educational Officers, Officers in a High Court.\n\n(b.) District and Sessions Judges who are permitted to avail themselves of the periodical court vacations.\n\nBut in case of urgent necessity, Privilege Leave may be granted to any such officer under the ordinary Rules, subject to the conditions (1) that the officer shall during his absence receive only half the salary and allowances ordinarily admissible during Privilege Leave, and (2) that the leave cannot in any case be combined with vacation.\n\n2. Rule 1 does not apply to the case of an officer who is, by general or special orders issued by competent authority, prevented in any year from availing himself of the vacation or vacations by reason of his having to remain at his post on duty. In such a case Privilege Leave may be granted under the ordinary Rules; provided always that the leave shall not in any case be combined with vacation.\n\n3. An officer who is, by general or special orders issued by competent authority, prevented from availing himself of a part only of a periodical vacation may, during Privilege Leave subsequently taken, draw his full salary for a period bearing the same proportion, if the vacation be annual, to a month, or if it be half-yearly, to half a month, as the time spent on duty during the vacation bears to the whole vacation.\n\nNote.\u2014This Rule operates only in the case of an Officer who is absent during vacation, when Privilege Leave earned under the operation of the Ordinary Rules is not due to him. In cases in which Privilege Leave under the Ordinary Rules is due, enjoyment of the vacation, or part thereof, not exceeding the amount of Privilege Leave due, shall be considered in reckoning the amount of Privilege Leave afterwards due.\n\n74. To an Officer who has been on duty, without interruption, for eleven calendar months, and who has not, for six calendar months, been absent on Privilege Leave, the whole or any part of the Privilege Leave due to him may be granted.\n\n1. An Officer applying for Privilege Leave must record a declaration that he has no intention of retiring or of taking Furlough, Special Leave, Subsidiary Leave, Leave on Private Affairs or Leave on Medical Certificate for three months after his return to duty. Though not absolutely debarred by this declaration from applying for permission to retire or to take such leave within the three months, he should, if he does so, explain his change of mind.\n\n75. An Officer on Privilege Leave has a lien on his substantive appointment; he has also a lien on his officiating appointment, so long as it is not resumed by an Officer having a superior lien on it.\n\n76. An Officer on Privilege Leave is entitled to a Leave Allowance equal to the salary which he would receive if he were on duty in the appointment on which he has a lien.\n\n1. If Privilege Leave is granted to an Officer who holds an appointment sanctioned only for a limited time and for a special purpose, he is not entitled, during Privilege Leave, to any Special Allowance attached to the appointment.\n\n2.

Mate Leadsman     | 150       |\n| 2nd Mate Leadsman      | 125       |\n| Leadsman Apprentice    | 100       |\n\n145. Furlough may be taken to the extent of four years during the entire period of service in the following instalments, viz., after ten years' service two years, and after every subsequent eight years, one year on an allowance of half the average pay for the last three years. Provided that no Furlough can be granted to an Officer who has taken Leave on Medical Certificate until three years after his return from Leave on Medical Certificate.\n\nIf a portion of an instalment is taken, the remainder may be added to any later instalment; provided that not more than two years' Furlough may be taken at one time.\n\n146. Leave on Medical Certificate may be taken to the extent of three years during the whole period of service, but not for more than two years at a time, and not more than twice out of India. Such Leave cannot be taken for more than one year except after three years' Continuous Service immediately preceding. Leave on Medical Certificate cannot be counted as service for Furlough, and no Leave on Medical Certificate can be taken while any Furlough is due. An Officer on Leave under this Section is entitled to half his average pay for the first fifteen months of each period of absence, but not for more than thirty months in all. For the rest of his Leave under this Section he is entitled to a quarter of his average pay. The minimum furlough allowance during Leave on Medical Certificate to the Officer to whom any allowance is due shall be:\n\nRs.\n\nIn the case of a Branch Pilot, Master Pilot, and Mate Pilot ... ... ... 100 a month.\n\nIn the case of a Mate Leadsman, and Leadsman Apprentice ... ... ... 50 a month.\n\n147. (a) Special Leave on Urgent Private Affairs may be granted at any time for not more than six months; provided that an Officer who has had Special Leave must render six years' Active Service before he can again have such Leave.\n\n(b) For the first six months for which an Officer is on Special Leave, whether the six months be included in the same Leave or not, he is entitled to Leave Allowance of half his average pay for the last three years.\n\n(c) Thereafter he is entitled to No Leave Allowance.\n\n148. Subsidiary Leave on half average Pay, on the terms and conditions prescribed in Sections 64 and 65 of the Code, may be availed of and added to Furlough, Leave on Medical Certificate, and Special Leave on Urgent Private Affairs, taken out of India.\n\n149. Privilege Leave may be taken either\u2014\n\n(a) As provided for Officers in Sections 71\u201476; or\n\n(b) For a period of two months in every twelve, on half pay (which cannot be accumulated) on a Medical Certificate showing that the applicant requires, through sickness, more leave than he could take under the ordinary Privilege Leave Rules in Sections 71\u201476. When such Leave is taken in extension of ordinary Privilege Leave, the period of ordinary Privilege Leave first taken under Clause (a) must be commuted to double the period on half pay under Clause (b). Leave taken under this Clause shall be reckoned as Active Service; provided that if Leave taken under this Clause be extended under Medical Certificate, the whole of the Leave shall be treated as Leave on Medical Certificate under Section 146.\n\n(c) The Leave authorised in Clause (b) may be taken in instalments; but a Pilot may not take Leave under Clause (a) for eleven months after his return to duty from his last Leave taken under Clause (b).\n\n150. A Pilot is eligible after he attains the age of fifty-five years for Privilege Leave, and for any Special Leave on Urgent Private Affairs to which he may be otherwise entitled. No Leave other than Privilege Leave or Special Leave on Urgent Private Affairs granted to a Pilot before his fifty-fifth birthday, has effect after that date.\n\nCHAPTER XII.\n\nPORT BLAIR POLICE.\n\n151. Privilege Leave may be granted to the men employed in the Port Blair Police Force as under:\n\n- 3 months after 30 months' consecutive service.\n- 3 months after 36 months' consecutive service.\n\nSuch Leave cannot be claimed as a right, and will only be granted when it can be given without inconvenience to the Public Service. During Privilege Leave full pay is admissible.\n\n152. While sick in hospital at Port Blair or Nancowry allowances are granted as follows:\n\n- Constables.... Full pay for so long as they may be in Hospital.\n- Sergeants ..... Ditto.\n- Chief Constables, Sub-Inspectors, and Inspectors... In accordance with Section 129.\n\nDuring Sick Leave spent in India, allowance is granted at the following rates:\n\n- Constables (Subsistence Allowances)... Rs. 6\n- Sergeants ... Half-pay for 15 months, and Sub allowance of Rs. 15 a month after that term.\n\n153. Furlough and Sick Leave to India is granted to Inspectors and Sub-Inspectors under the Rules in Chapter X.\n\n154. Furlough to unmarried men, or men whose families remain at their homes in India, may be given in turn after five years' Continuous Service in the Settlement. Furlough may also be given, in special cases, at the discretion of the Superintendent, to married men having their families at the Settlement, after a continuous service of not less than five years.\n\n155. Such Furlough carries with it half-pay, and may be for periods of from four to six months, according to the distance of the applicant's home from Calcutta.\n\n156. Leave-men proceeding to India should be employed, ordinarily, on the voyage in guarding transferred convicts, and when not required for the purpose they may be granted deck passages at the expense of Government.\n\n157. From the port of debarkation they will proceed to their homes at their own expense, and on the expiration of their Furlough they will report themselves to the Commissioner of Police, Calcutta, with a view to their employment as convict guards on the return voyage. If not required for this purpose, they may be granted a deck passage at the public expense.\n\n158. The total number of men on Leave at one time from all causes other than Privilege Leave shall not exceed ten per cent. of the Force.\n\n159. Absence without Leave is punishable by dismissal or forfeiture of pay.\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\nJOINING TIME.\n\n160. Joining Time is the time allowed to an Officer to proceed from one Station to another when his appointment is changed, or when, being unemployed, he is appointed to any office. An Officer is held to be on duty during Joining Time, if he is entitled to allowances.\n\n1.\u2014Only one day is allowed for joining an appointment which does not, necessarily, involve a change of residence.\n\n[Note.\u2014See Proviso VI. to Rule 2.]\n\n2.\u2014Otherwise, Joining Time is calculated as follows, excluding Sundays not actually spent in travelling:\n\nSix days for preparation; and, in addition, thereto\u2014\n\nfor the portion of the journey which (a day for the Officer travels, or might travel,\u2014\n\nby Railway ... ... ... 200 miles,\nby Ocean Steamer ... ... ... 150 \",\nby River Steamer ... ... ... 80 \",\nby Mail Cart or other public stage conveyance drawn by horses... ... ... 80 \",\nin any other way ... ... ... 15 \",\n\n[Note.\u2014An extra day is allowed for any fraction of distance over that prescribed. But see Rule 15 in the case of Ministerial Officers on salaries not exceeding Rs. 100 a month.]\n\nProvisos\u2014\n\nI.\u2014The maximum Joining Time is thirty days: the following provisos are all subject to this maximum.\n\n[Note.\u2014If the Local Government is satisfied that an Officer has, through no fault of his own, been unable to avail himself of the usual mode of travelling, it may extend even the maximum Joining Time of thirty days. But in that case it should report its proceedings to the Government of India in the Finance Department, with a full statement of the circumstances of the case.]\n\nII.\u2014When part of the journey is by steamer, the days intervening between the Officer being set free from his office, or, if he has no office, receiving his orders, and the departure of the steamer, or his start duly regulated to catch the steamer, shall be added to the time calculated under this Rule.\n\nIII.\u2014By whatever route the Officer travels, his Joining Time shall, unless the Local Government specially permits otherwise, be calculated by the route which travellers habitually use.\n\n[Note.\u2014But see Rule 15 for Ministerial Officers on salaries not exceeding Rs. 100 a month.]\n\nIV.\u2014If the Officer satisfies his new Departmental Superior that, notwithstanding due diligence on his part, the journey has occupied altogether more time than is allowed by the Rules, the time actually occupied may be allowed.\n\nV.\u2014On being satisfied that the Rules have, in any particular case, operated hardly, as for example if an Officer has, through no default on his part, missed a steamer, or fallen sick on the journey, the Local Government may, for reasons stated, allow concessions in excess of what is admissible by the Rules, on such conditions as to allowances otherwise as it may think fit. Such concessions must not be made as a mere indulgence or otherwise than because the Rules do not appear to provide reasonably and equitably for the case.\n\nVI.\u2014The Local Government may, for reasons stated, extend the Joining Time admissible by Rule if it considers such extension necessary for the public convenience, or for the saving of public expense, as, for example, to prevent unnecessary and merely formal transfers.\n\n[Note.\u2014This Proviso applies also to Rule 1.]\n\nVII.\u2014The Accountant General shall bring to the notice of the Local Government any concession made under Proviso IV. which seems to him improper or unreasonable, and shall move the Local Government to report to the Government of India any concession made under Proviso V., or extension made under Proviso VI., which appears to him contrary to the spirit of those Provisos. The Local Government may not, in either case, finally override the Accountant General without a reference to the Governor General in Council.\n\n[Note.\u2014Upon the application of the Local Government, the Government of India will sanction any necessary relaxation or modification of these Rules in exceptional localities, where their general application would operate harshly.]\n\n3. The Joining Time of an Officer whose appointment is changed while he is in transit from one appointment to another, begins on the day following that on which he receives his orders.\n\n10. Except in the case mentioned in Rule 12, an Officer draws during Joining time the pay or salary which he drew in his old appointment or that which he draws in the new, whichever is less; provided that an officer transferred from one officiating appointment to another shall not draw any acting allowance during Joining time if he had not a superior lien on either of the officiating appointments to that of the officer relieved by or relieving him.\n\n12. An Uncovenanted Officer, who has no substantive appointment is not entitled to any allowance during Joining Time; but, if such an Officer, officiating in an office, is transferred to another office under the same Local Government, the Local Government may allow him to draw, during his transit, the allowance to which he would be entitled under Rule 10.\n\n14. An Officer who does not join his new appointment within his Joining Time, is entitled to no allowances after the end of his Joining Time, and, after a week, ceases to have a lien on any appointment. But if the Local Government considers that his default was due to circumstances beyond his control, it may exempt him from the loss of his appointment. The expression \"Allowances\" in this Rule does not include travelling allowance.\n\n15. A Ministerial Officer, whose salary does not exceed Rs. 100 a month, should not ordinarily be required to travel by mail cart or other public stage conveyance drawn by horses.\n\nCHAPTER XIV.\n\nPAYMENT OF LEAVE ALLOWANCES.\n\n161. (a) Leave Allowances are payable in India after the end of each Calendar month; but an Officer on Furlough or Special Leave out of India may, at his option, take payment at the Home Treasury of the Government of India, and, if he proceeds to any colony named in the list in Schedule C, in such colony.\n\n1. Privilege leave allowances are not payable out of India; but in case an Officer leaving India should afterwards want his leave to be commuted, he should take with him a certificate as follows:\u2014\n\nPRIVILEGE LEAVE CERTIFICATE.\n\n(Name of, and designation of office held by, the Officer.\n\n1 Government under which employed.\n2 Date of beginning of Leave.\n3 Date on which Leave will end.\n4 Whether Furlough or Special Leave is admissible on Privilege Leave being commuted, so to what extent and on what terms.\nCHAPTER XIV.\u2014continued.\n\n(Note.\u2014If Furlough or Special Leave is granted, the Leave Allowances admissible will not be paid out of India until the Officer produces a last Pay Certificate.)\n\n(Place) (Signature)\n(Date) Accountant General.\n\nN.B.\u2014Privilege Leave Allowances are not payable out of India.\n\n2. An officer proceeding on Furlough or Special Leave out of India cannot draw his Leave Allowances at the Home or any Colonial Treasury unless he is provided with a Last-pay Certificate.\n\n(b) If payments be taken at the Home Treasury it is made quarterly, and rupees are converted into sterling at the rate of exchange fixed, for the time being, for the adjustment of financial transactions between the Imperial and the Indian Treasuries. Unless otherwise arranged, this rate of exchange is also applied in the payment of leave allowances in a Colony. If any payments are made at a different rate, or, otherwise, erroneously, they should be adjusted in subsequent payments.\n\nException. The Absentee Allowance of a Military Officer on Furlough out of India and drawn in England, who elected the Military Furlough Rules of 1868 before the 1st July, 1871, is paid at the rate of two shillings the Government rupee.\n\n1. Payment is made at the Home Treasury as follows:\n\nIn respect of civil officers, on or after January 1st, April 1st, July 1st, and October 1st, for the quarters ending respectively on December 31st, March 31st, June 30th, and September 30th; and in respect of military officers, on or after February 1st, May 1st, August 1st, and November 1st, for the quarters ending respectively on January 31st, April 30th, July 31st, and October 31st\u2014\n\nto the officer on his personal application;\n\nor\n\nto his banker or other agent, duly authorized under power-of-attorney, on production of a life certificate, filled up and executed in the manner directed thereon (except in cases where proof of existence is not required owing to the banker having guaranteed the Secretary of State against loss consequent on his dispensing with the production of such proof);\n\nor\n\non presentation of a draft, duly filled up and signed by the officer, in a form which, with the requisite form of life certificate attached, may be obtained from the India Office, London, on the officer's written application.\n\n2. If in any covenant or contract, dated before the 23rd day of November, 1871, with any Officer for service in India, it is provided that, in payments to be made under, or in pursuance of the contract, a pound sterling shall be considered an equivalent or equal to, and calculated after the rate of, ten rupees, any leave allowance due to the Officer is, under his covenant or contract, entitled to receive, in England, shall be converted into sterling at that rate. But if, in such contract, no provision is made for the payment of any allowances during leave, the aforesaid rate of exchange will not apply to any leave allowances.\n\n3. If an Officer receives an advance of pay in England to enable him to return to duty in India, the advance will be recovered at the rate or rates of exchange fixed for the adjustment of financial transactions between the Imperial and Indian Governments for the year in which the advance was made. This Rule will also apply when an advance is made in England to a person appointed there, proceeding to India to join his appointment.\n\nCHAPTER XV.\n\nLAST PAY CERTIFICATE AND WARRANT.\n\n[Note.\u2014This Rule does not apply to Officers employed in the Public Works Department.]\n\n169. No Officer (unless he has been newly appointed to the Service of Government) can begin to draw any pay or allowances at any treasury in India, or at the Home Treasury of the Government of India, without producing a Last-pay Certificate from the treasury where his pay or allowances were last disbursed, or from the Accountant General within whose jurisdiction this treasury is.\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\nRETURN TO DUTY.\n\n[This Chapter does not apply to Military Officers subject to Military Rules, except in respect to Leave of Absence granted in the Civil Department.]\n\n165. An Officer who remains absent after the end of his Leave is entitled to no allowance for the period of such absence, and ceases to have a lien on any appointment,\n\nIf his Leave was Furlough,\u2014immediately; and\n\nIf it was Special or Privilege Leave,\u2014after a week.\n\n1. An Officer on Furlough or Special Leave in Europe may not return to India without obtaining the permission of the Secretary of State. He must apply for this permission at least three months before the end of his Leave. An Officer whose Furlough was granted or has been extended on medical certificate is required to produce a certificate of fitness before he can be permitted to return to duty. Ordinarily, he must obtain this certificate from the Medical Board of the India Office, but, in special cases, particularly if the officer be residing at a distance of more than sixty miles from London, the Secretary of State will, at his discretion, accept a certificate from two medical practitioners in lieu thereof.\n\n2. If a Local Government considers it inexpedient that an Officer should return from Furlough or Special Leave in Europe to duty in India, it should furnish a complete statement of the circumstances to the Secretary of State (in the case of the Government of Madras or Bombay, direct, or otherwise, through the Government of India). If possible, when the Furlough or Special Leave is granted, but, in any case, in time to enable the Secretary of State to take any measures that may seem to him necessary before the Officer would, in ordinary course, be permitted to return to duty. The report to the Secretary of State should reach the India Office, at latest, three months before the end of the Officer's Leave.\n\n9. An Officer may not, without the permission of the Authority which granted him Leave, return to duty more than fourteen days before the end of Furlough or Special Leave.\n\n[Note.\u2014This Rule applies to a Military Officer subject to Military Rules; but, he must obtain permission to return to duty from the Local Government.]\nBy Section 1 (c) the Rules of the Civil Leave Code, and not those in Chapter X. apply (subject to specified restrictions in the case of particular Rules) to any one of the following Officers who does not belong to the Covenanted Civil Service or the Army, provided that he was appointed to his Office by the Secretary of State, or with his particular sanction.\n\n**General.**\u2014Officers holding substantive appointments, such as are usually held by Covenanted

Should he not have passed the examination in the Native languages by the lower standard before joining a Native Corps, he will be required to do so within 18 months of so joining, otherwise he will cease to be a Probationer.\n\n6. After the expiration of one year from the date of appointment on probation, the Probationer, provided he has passed the higher standard examination in the Native languages and the professional examination required under regulation, may be admitted to the Staff Corps.\n\n7. On the expiration of 18 months from date of appointment on probation he will be admitted to the Staff Corps whether he has passed the above examinations or not, on production of certificates in the Forms C, D and E.\n\n8.

Should he not pass within this period he will be removed from the Service.\n\nPART II.\n\nOfficers of Corps serving out of India.*\n\n10.

His application must be submitted through his commanding officer to the Military Secretary, Horse Guards, and be accompanied by certificates in the Forms B and D, and by a declaration in the Form E.\n\n12. An officer will not be allowed to volunteer for any particular Staff Corps, but on arrival in India he will be posted under the orders of the Government of that country to whichever of the three Corps the exigencies of the Service may demand.\n\n13. If accepted, a candidate will be required to embark for India within two months of being so warned, and the date of embarkation for India shall be the date of his coming on the Indian Establishment.\n\n14.

Officers of Our Corps of Royal Engineers may, with the sanction of Our Secretary of State for India in Council, elect to render continuous service to the Government of India, and the election shall be open to\nOfficers who at the date of this Our Warrant are performing their first tour of service in India, or who may hereafter proceed to India for that purpose (the election to be made within four years of their first arrival in India or in cases where this period has already been completed on or before the 1st October 1886); Officers who are now serving on the Indian Establishment, but who have served part of their time elsewhere than in India; Officers who having previously served in India are now serving on the British Establishment; (the election in each of the latter classes to be made on or before the 1st October 1886*).\n\n2. Officers electing for such continuous service shall enjoy the conditions of Indian pay and allowances at present existing, subject to such modifications of the same as may at any time appear expedient.\n\n3. They shall be eligible for leave under the conditions applicable to Officers admitted to Our Indian Staff Corps on or after the date of this Our Warrant.\n\n4. They shall be subject to the same regulations as to military promotion, and liability to removal from the effective list, as apply to the other Officers of Our Royal Engineers.\n\n5. They shall be required, should occasion arise, to serve elsewhere than on the Indian Establishment.\n\n6. They shall be allowed, under conditions to be laid down by Our Secretary of State for India in Council, and with his sanction and that of Our Secretary of State for War, to exchange with Officers of the Corps serving on the British Establishment.\n\n7.

The Regulations under which, with the view of securing the flow of promotion in Our Corps of Royal Engineers, Officers of the Corps may be placed on half pay or retired, shall not be held to disqualify the Officers on the Indian Establishment so affected from continuing to hold any appointments in the Civil Departments of the Government of India which they may have been holding previously, and, subject to the discretion of the Government of India, their tenure of such appointments shall be regulated by the rules which apply to other persons holding similar appointments in the same Departments.\n\n9. Officers permitted to elect for continuous Indian service shall be eligible, except as is hereinafter laid down, for pensions under the conditions and at the rates applicable to Officers admitted to Our Staff Corps after the 1st July, 1881.\n\n10.

An Officer serving on the Indian Establishment at the date of this Our Warrant, who has served part of his time elsewhere than in India, or an Officer serving on the British Establishment at this same date, who may hereafter proceed to India, shall on retirement receive a pension consisting of the retired pay to which he would be entitled under Our Warrant regulating the retired pay of Our Royal Engineers generally, and, in addition, such a portion of the difference between the said retired pay and the Staff Corps pension belonging to his length of Indian service as is represented by the proportion his Indian service bears to his total service. In calculating the period of Indian service for pension, three years of British service shall be reckoned as Indian service.\n\n12. Should an Officer retire before he has served a sufficient time to entitle him to a pension under the rules applicable to the Staff Corps as aforesaid, he shall be granted only such retired pay or gratuity as he would have been entitled to receive under Our Warrant regulating the retired pay of Officers of Our Royal Engineers generally had he not elected for continuous Indian service.\n\n13. Officers who have already had periods of leave under conditions which allowed them to count such periods as service for pension shall, in the event of their volunteering for permanent service in India, be allowed the benefit of counting such periods towards pension under the conditions of this Our Warrant.\n\n14. Officers of the permanent Indian Establishment transferred to the half pay list on account of ill health shall come under the same conditions as Officers of the Indian Staff Corps.\n\n15. Our Secretary of State for India in Council shall be the sole administrator and interpreter of this Our Warrant, and shall be empowered to issue such instructions in reference thereto as he may from time to time deem necessary.\n\nGiven at Our Court at Windsor, this twentieth day of February 1886, and in the forty-ninth year of Our Reign,\n\nBy Her Majesty's Command,\n\nKIMBERLEY.\n\nREGULATIONS FOR THE EXAMINATION OF CANDIDATES FOR THE APPOINTMENT OF SURGEON IN HER MAJESTY'S INDIAN MEDICAL SERVICE.\n\n1.

The position of the candidates on the list of Surgeons will be determined by the combined results of the preliminary and of the final examinations, and, so far as the requirements of the service will permit, they will have the choice of Presidency in India, according to their position in that list.\n\nIndia Office, December, 1886.\n\nN.B.\u2014There will be an examination for 23 appointments in February 1887.\nDECLARATION AND SCHEDULE OF QUALIFICATIONS, TO BE FILLED UP BY CANDIDATES.\n\nChristian and Surname at full length.\n\nI years of age in last, vide accompanying certificate, a Candidate for employment as Surgeon in Her Majesty's Indian Medical Service, do hereby attest my readiness to engage for that service, and to proceed on duty immediately on being gazetted.\n\nI declare that I labour under no mental nor constitutional disease, nor any imperfection or disability that can interfere with the most efficient discharge of the duties of a Medical Officer.\n\n(The Dates of Graduations and the Universities or Colleges are to be stated.)\n\nI have the Degree of A.M. or A.B. from the\nI have the Degree of M.D. or M.B. from the\nI have a License to Practise Medicine from the\nI have a Diploma in Surgery from the\nI have a License to Practise Surgery from the\n\nThe Candidate should here state whether he has served in the Medical Department of the Army or Navy, or in the Subordinate Medical Department in India.\n\n(Signature at full length)\n(Date)\n(Place of Residence)\n\nCandidates who desire to undergo the voluntary examination are to sign the following declaration:\n\nIt is my intention to undergo the voluntary examination in *\n\nN.B.

This memorandum is based on the regulations in force at the present time. They are subject to any alteration that may be determined on.\n\nPASSAGE TO INDIA.\n\n2. Surgeons on appointment will, if possible, be provided with passage to India by troopship; but when troopship accommodation is not available, passage at the public expense will be provided by steamer, or a passage allowance will be granted, if preferred. A charge for messing during the voyage will be made at the rate of 2s. a day. This payment will not include the cost of liquors, which will be charged for as extras.\n\n3. All Surgeons who shall neglect or refuse to proceed to India under the orders of the Secretary of State for India within two months from the date of leaving Netley, will be considered as having forfeited their appointments, unless special circumstances shall justify a departure from this regulation.\n\nPAY PREVIOUS TO EMBARKATION\n\n4. The rate of pay drawn by Surgeons from the date of passing the final examination at the Army Medical School until arrival in India will be 10s. a day. (For rates subsequent to their landing in India, see paras. 14, 15, and 16.)\n\nPay at the above rate will be issued in this country up to the date of embarkation, and an advance of two months' pay at the same rate will also be made prior to embarkation, which will be adjusted in India in accordance with the rate laid down in para. 14.\n\nGRADES AND RELATIVE RANK.\n\n5. The grades of Medical Officers in the Indian Military Forces are six in number, viz.:\u2014\n\n1. Surgeon-General, ranking as Major-General, according to the date of his Commission.\n2. Deputy Surgeon-General, as Colonel, according to the date of his Commission.\n3. Brigade Surgeon, as Lieutenant-Colonel, according to the date of his Commission, or according to the date on which he completed twenty years' service as Surgeon and Surgeon-Major.\n4. Surgeon-Major, as Major, according to the date of his Commission; and after twenty years' service as Surgeon and Surgeon-Major, as Lieutenant-Colonel.\n5. Surgeon, as Captain according to the date of his Commission.\n6. Surgeon on probation, as Lieutenant.\n\nPROMOTION.\n\n6. A Surgeon is promoted to Surgeon-Major on completion of twelve years' Service from date of first Commission.\n\n7. In cases, however, of emergency, or when the good of the service renders such alteration desirable, it is competent for the Secretary of State for India, on the recommendation of the Viceroy and Governor-General of India in Council, to shorten the period of service above mentioned, in such manner as he shall deem fit and expedient.\n\n8. All promotions from the rank of Surgeon-Major to that of Brigade Surgeon, from the rank of Brigade Surgeon to that of Deputy Surgeon-General, and from the rank of Deputy Surgeon-General to that of Surgeon-General, are given by selection for ability and merit.\n\n9. On appointment as Honorary Physician or Honorary Surgeon to Her Majesty an Officer below the rank of Deputy Surgeon-General shall be promoted to that rank.\n\n10. Time passed on half-pay will in no case be reckoned as service in calculating claims for promotion.\n\nTENURE OF OFFICE IN ADMINISTRATIVE GRADES.\n\n11. The tenure of office of Surgeons-General and Deputy Surgeons-General is limited to five years.\n\n12. Deputy Surgeons-General, if not disqualified by age, are eligible either for employment for a second tour of duty in the same grade, or for employment in the higher grade of Surgeon-General by promotion thereto.\n\n* State what subjects will be taken up.\n13. Absence on leave in excess of six months on medical certificate, or of four months on private affairs, involves forfeiture of appointment.\n\n**Pay and Allowances**\n\n14. The following are the rates of \"Indian pay and allowances\" which will be drawn by Officers hereafter appointed to the Indian Medical Service:\n\n| Rank                          | Years' Service | Indian Pay and Allowances per mensem |\n|-------------------------------|---------------|--------------------------------------|\n|                               |               | When not holding an appointment      |\n|                               |               | carrying higher pay                  |\n| Brigade Surgeon and Surgeon-Major... | 25 and over   | R.

On first appointment they will only come into receipt of \"Indian pay and allowances\" (Column A) from the date of their arrival in India.\n\n16. Officers holding the principal administrative appointments and substantive military charges of the Indian Medical service receive at present the following consolidated salaries:\n\n- Surgeon-General, Bengal: Rs. 2,700\n- Surgeon-General, Madras: Rs. 2,500\n- Surgeon-General, Bombay: Rs. 2,500\n- Surgeon-General, Frontier: Rs. 2,250\n- Deputy Surgeon-General: Rs. 1,800\n\n1,000 with Rs. 90, horse allowance in Cavalry regiments.\n\n800 with Rs. 90 ditto\n\n600 with Rs. 60 ditto\n\n450 with Rs. 60 ditto\n\n17. The salaries of other substantive medical appointments in the Civil and Military Departments are consolidated, and vary from Rs. 1,800 to Rs. 400 per mensem.\n\n18. Qualified officers of the Medical Service are also eligible for appointments in the Assay Department. The salaries of these appointments are from Rs. 600 to Rs. 2,250 per mensem.\n\n19. Medical Officers are required to perform two years' regimental duty in India before they can be considered eligible for civil employment.\n\n20. No Medical Officer, however employed, can receive any staff allowance in addition to the pay laid down in para. 14 unless he has passed the examination in Hindustani known as the \"Lower Standard.\" The passing of this examination does not of itself bring any increase of pay to an Officer, unless appointed to a substantive or officiating charge; but failure to pass disqualifies an Officer, even when holding such substantive or officiating charge, from receiving any portion of the staff allowances of the appointment.\n\n21. Surgeons-General and Deputy Surgeons-General on vacating office at the expiration of the five years' tour of duty, will be permitted to draw in India respectively an unemployed salary of Rs. 1,200 per mensem in the former, and Rs. 900 in the latter case, for a period of six months from the date of their vacating office, after which they will be placed while unemployed on the following scale of pay per diem:\n\n| Surgeon-General | Deputy Surgeon-General |\n|-----------------|------------------------|\n| After 30 years service on full pay | \u00a3 s. d. |\n| 25              | 2 5 0                  |\n| 20              | 2 5 0                  |\n| on promotion should this period of service not be completed | 2 0 0 |\n|                 | 1 8 0                  |\n\n**Leave Rules**\n\n22. Officers of the Indian Medical Service, below the rank of Deputy Surgeon-General, may be granted:\n\n(1.) Privilege leave under such regulations as may from time to time be in force.\n\n(2.) Leave out of India, for no longer period than one year, capable of extension to two years' absence from duty, on the following pay:\n\n- After arrival in India, on first appointment: \u00a3200 a year.\n- After the commencement of the 5th year's service for pension: 250\n- Ditto, ditto, 10th ditto: 500\n- Ditto, ditto, 15th ditto: 400\n- Ditto, ditto, 20th ditto: 450\n- Ditto, ditto, 25th ditto: 500\n\n*Officers in Civil Employment, while they continue in such employment, are not affected by these rules.*\n(3.) Leave in India, but for the period of one year only, on full military pay and half the Staff salary of appointment.\n\n(4.) No extension of leave involving absence from duty for more than two years, whether taken in or out of India, can be granted except on specially urgent grounds and without pay.\n\n(5.) An officer, unable on account of the state of his health to return to duty within the maximum period of two years' absence will, unless he is under Rule (4) specially granted an extension of leave without pay, be placed on temporary half pay or the retired list, as the circumstances of the case may require. An officer will also be liable to be placed on half pay or the retired list should his health require an undue amount of leave, whether in or out of India.\n\n(6.) Leave may be granted at any time, but solely at the discretion of the Commanders-in-Chief, or of the Local Governments in India in the case of officers not under the direct orders of a Commander-in-Chief.\n\n(7.) An officer on leave, whether in India or out of India, will be required to rejoin at once on being recalled to duty, unless certified by a Medical Board as unfit to do so.\n\n(8.) All leave, in or out of India, will count as service for pension.\n\n23. Officers of the Administrative Grades are entitled during their tenure of appointment to six months' leave of absence on sick certificate, or four months' leave on private affairs.\n\nHonours and Rewards.\n\n24. Officers of the Indian Medical Service are eligible for the military distinction of the Order of the Bath, and for good service pensions.\n\n25. Six of the most meritorious Officers are named Honorary Physicians, and six are named Honorary Surgeons, to Her Majesty.\n\nRetiring Pensions and Half-Pay.\n\n26. Officers of the Indian Medical Service will be allowed to retire on the following scale of pension, on completion of the required periods of service:\n\n| After 30 years' service for pension | \u00a3 |\n|-------------------------------------|--|\n| \" 25 \"                              | 700 |\n| \" 20 \"                              | 500 |\n| \" 17 \"                              | 365 |\n|                                     | 292 |\n\n27. Time of service for pension will reckon from date of arrival in India, and will include all leave taken under the rules quoted in para. 22. The period of residence at the Army Medical School will also reckon as service for the above pension, except in the cases of Officers who have gone through the course at Netley as candidates for the British Army or Navy Medical Service.\n\n28. A Surgeon-General, after five years' active employment in India in that grade, will be entitled to retire upon a pension of \u00a3250 per annum, in addition to that which he may be entitled under the above scale.\n\n29. A Deputy Surgeon-General will, after five years' active employment in India in that grade, be entitled to retire upon a pension of \u00a3250 per annum, in addition to the pension to which he may be entitled under the above scale.\n\n30. In each of the above cases stated in paras. 28 and 29, six months' absence on medical certificate will be allowed to count towards actual service in those grades.\n\n31. A Surgeon-General or Deputy Surgeon-General who has completed his term of service and has reverted to British pay, may reside in Europe, at the same time qualifying for higher pension.\n\n32. With a view to maintain the efficiency of the service, all Medical Officers of the rank of Brigade Surgeon and Surgeon-Major shall be placed on the Retired List when they shall have attained the age of fifty-five years, and all Surgeons-General and Deputy Surgeons-General when they shall have attained the age of sixty years. In any special case, where it would appear to be for the good of the service that the Officer should continue in employment, he may be so continued, subject in each case to the sanction of the Secretary of State for India in Council.\n\n33. A Medical Officer, retiring after a service of twenty years and upwards, may, if recommended for the same by the Government of his Presidency, receive a step of honorary rank, but without any consequent increase of pay.\n\n34. Medical Officers not entitled to pension, when placed on temporary or permanent half-pay under para. 22 (5), will be granted the British rate of half-pay of their relative rank as under:\n\n| Rank                  | Relative Rank | Rates of Half-pay |\n|-----------------------|---------------|------------------|\n|                       |               | Per Diem. | Per Annum. |\n|                       |               | s. d.     | \u00a3 s. d.   |\n| Brigade Surgeon       | Lieut.-Colonel| 11 0      | 200 15 0  |\n| Surgeon-Major of 20 years' service | Major | 9 6 | 173 7 6 |\n| Surgeon-Major         | Captain       | 7 0       | 127 15 0  |\n\nOfficers cannot retire in India on half-pay (No. 54, 28th February 1865).\n\n35. The period passed on half-pay will in no case be reckoned as service in calculating claims for promotion or to pension on retirement.\n\nNote referred to on previous page: Substantive and Officiating Charges:\n\nMedical charges are of two kinds\u2014substantive and officiating. The first is held by an Officer as his fixed and permanent appointment. For this he is entitled to the monthly consolidated pay laid down in the above scale (para. 16), subject to the condition specified in para. 20.\n\nAn officiating charge is held by an Officer who is acting temporarily in an appointment during the absence of the Officer whose substantive charge it is. The Officer thus officiating receives not the consolidated pay of the appointment laid down in the scale (para. 16), but the Indian pay and allowances (para. 14) of his own grade, plus half the staff allowance of the appointment in which he is officiating.\nAn Officer's staff allowance is the difference between his \"Indian pay and allowances\" (para. 14) and \"consolidated pay\" (para. 16) as given in the scales. The staff pay of an appointment is the difference between the Indian pay and allowances and the consolidated pay of the permanent incumbent. It has been ruled, however, that the extra allowance for an officiating charge shall never be less than Rs. 100 per mensum.\n\nExample 1. A Surgeon of less than 5 years' service officiates for one in charge of a regiment of the same period of service. He receives Rs. 286. 10 + Rs. 100 = Rs. 386. 10.\n\nExample 2. A Surgeon of less than 5 years' service, officiating for a Surgeon of 6 years' service in charge of a regiment, receives Rs. 286. 10 + Rs. 600 = Rs. 992. 5. 2 = Rs. 990. 7. 5.\n\nWOUND PENSIONS.\n\n36. Medical Officers are entitled to the same allowances on account of wounds and injuries received in action as are granted to combatant Officers of Her Majesty's Indian Military Forces holding the same relative rank.\n\nFAMILY PENSIONS.\n\n37. The claims to pension of widows and families of Medical Officers shall be treated under the provisions of such Royal Warrant regulating the grant of pensions to the widows and families of British Officers as may be in force at the time being. (The Royal Warrant of 10th June 1854 is the one now in force.)\n\n38. The widows and families of Medical Officers are also entitled to pensions from the Indian Military Service Family Pension Fund, to which all Surgeons must, as a condition of their appointment, subscribe from the date of their arrival in India.\n\nMILITARY FURLOUGH REGULATIONS OF 1854.\n\nWith the view of adapting the regulations to the present increased facilities of communication, and to correct, as far as possible, any tendency in them to deter officers from resorting to the places which may be most conducive to the restoration of their health, when a change of climate is required for that purpose, the following rules are established, and are to have effect from the 1st February, 1854:\n\n1. All regimental officers in the service on the 1st February, 1854, who prefer retaining what may be considered the advantages of the old regulations, may do so, provided they signify their wish to that effect when they next apply for furlough or leave of absence, without any limitation whether such leave be in India or elsewhere, and officers who once make their election will not be entitled to any other choice, but will be afterwards subject to the new or old regulations, according to their decisions.\n\n2. Staff officers, as such, have not the above option allowed them, but they may retain the advantages of the old regulations by giving up their appointments, which, in such cases, will be considered vacated from the date of embarkation.\n\n3. To those officers who adopt them, the new regulations will apply retrospectively in respect of furlough and leave of absence beyond sea, and in computing their time of service for retirement, so that their furloughs or leaves of absence, whether under the old or the new rules, and whether on private affairs or sick certificate, within or beyond India, will count for service to the authorized extent only, in computing the time for retirement on full pay.\n\n4. Officers who have availed themselves of the option of the old rules are allowed to reconsider the question under the modifications now sanctioned.\n\n5. Officers who have not taken leave subsequent to the publication of the new rules on the 1st February, 1854, and who, consequently, may not have been called upon to declare whether they would abide by the old or the new regulations, will, on retirement from the service, be entitled to take full advantage of the privileges given by the new regulations.\n\nFURLOUGHS ON PRIVATE AFFAIRS.\n\n6. Every officer will be allowed a furlough to Europe, or elsewhere beyond sea, for a period of two years at the expiration of ten years' service, and for a second period of two years after twenty years' service in India.\n\n7. The second furloughs of two years each will only be granted after ten years' service in India from the date of the return to duty after the first furlough of two years. These furloughs are not to be cumulative, under any circumstances, but are limited to two years. Officers who have taken leave of absence on sick certificate to Europe, or elsewhere beyond sea, will be ineligible to a furlough on private affairs until they have served six years from their last return to duty. This rule does not apply to short leaves to sea.\n\nOfficers who take their first furlough after twenty years' service in India, may take their second furlough after an additional service of five years from the date of their first return to duty. (G.O. 16 June, 1856.)\n\n8. All grants of furlough on private affairs are subject to the exigencies of the public service, and to the regulations framed for and preservation of the efficiency of each regiment by limiting the number of absentees.\n\n9. Officers holding staff or other detached appointments, may be allowed furlough for a period of six months without losing their appointments; but, during that period, they will not be entitled to any portion of their staff salary, which will be drawn in full by the officers officiating for them.\n\nAbsence for six months under this rule does not preclude an officer from taking his furlough to Europe after ten years' service. (G.O. 16 June, 1856.)\n\n10. All officers, whether staff or regimental, while on furlough on private affairs, will be entitled to \"Furlough Pay\" only.\n\nLEAVE OF ABSENCE ON SICK CERTIFICATE.\n\n11. Leave of absence on sick certificate will be granted for a term not exceeding eighteen months, whether it be to any place in Europe, or elsewhere out of India.\n\n12. Extensions of such leave may be granted, as at present, on production of medical certificates, for further periods not exceeding eighteen months in the whole.\n\n13. An officer holding a staff or other detached appointment, will be allowed to be absent on sick certificate in England, or elsewhere beyond sea, for a period of twenty months, without losing his appointment; and, during the first six months only of such absence, he will be entitled to draw half the staff salary of his appointment, the officer officiating for him drawing the remaining half salary during the first six months, and the whole salary during the remainder of the time.\n\n14. An officer's claim to half staff salary for six months, as sanctioned in the preceding rule, will not be affected by his subsequently retiring from the service in Europe or elsewhere.\n\n15. No portion of command allowance, medical staff salary, or other similar allowance, which under the old rules was inadmissible to officers absent from their corps or stations, at the Cape or elsewhere, will be allowed to absent officers under these regulations.\n\n16. All officers, whether staff or regimental, while on leave of absence on sick certificate, will be entitled for a period of six months to the same rate of Indian pay and allowances as was allowed under the old regulations to officers proceeding to the Cape on medical certificate, and for the remaining period of their leave they will receive furlough pay only.\n\n17. If the leave on sick certificate be extended, furlough pay will be continued; but under no circumstances for a longer period than three years altogether, from the commencement of the absence.\n\nSTAFF OFFICERS.\n\n18. The term, \"staff officers,\" applies to all officers holding staff or detached appointments, military (general or regimental), political, or civil; also to general officers\ncommanding divisions, members of the Medical Board, superintending surgeons, and others who, under the old rules, were entitled to draw half staff allowance when absent at the Cape.\n\n19. Staff officers absent on leave beyond the periods stated in Rules 9 and 13 respectively, cannot retain their appointments and allowances except on special grounds to be sanctioned by the Government of the presidency. Any such special grant of leave is to be reported at once, with the reasons for it, and to be subject to approbation.\n\n20. The privilege of retaining staff appointments during leave of absence on sick certificate, or on furlough on private affairs will not be available a second time, if the fresh leave is on sick certificate, until an officer has been three years, or, if on private affairs, until he has been six years, in the discharge of the duties of his appointment, from the date of last return to it.\n\n21. This rule, however, does not apply to leaves of absence, whether on sick certificate or on private affairs in India, or for brief periods to Ceylon, the Mauritius, or other places out of India.\n\n22. Officers commanding troops of Horse Artillery and Light Field Batteries, and officers generally in employment, will be allowed leave out of India under the same rules with respect to allowance and tenure of command or office, as regulated the grant of leave to the Cape to such officers under the old regulations, except as to the duration of those advantages, the time for their continuance being subject to the provisions of the new regulations.\n\nDATE OF FURLOUGH AND ADVANCES OF PAY.\n\n23. The period of furlough on private affairs, or leave of absence on sick certificate, is to be calculated from the date of the departure from India of the ship in which the officer proceeds.\n\n24. Advances of pay and allowances, staff and regimental, to officers proceeding on leave of absence on sick certificate, who may be entitled to them, will be made in India for three months from date of embarkation. Payments in continuation will be made in England at the rates of exchange fixed annually for repayment of advances made on account of Her Majesty's Government. Furlough pay will continue to be issued in advance for six months when required by officers obtaining furlough on private affairs.\n\n25. The existing regulations regarding passage-money to officers are not affected by these rules.\n\n26. The certificates issued to officers who are granted furloughs on private affairs, or leave of absence on sick certificate, are to specify the time each officer has been absent on leave within Indian limits, as well as the time of his previous absence in Europe; but will not include the periods allowed for proceeding to the presidency or port of embarkation, and to enable officers to rejoin their regiments or stations after their return to India, nor the leave of one month's absence in six months, as authorized by the regulations. The last pay certificate of all officers proceeding to England on sick certificate is to specify the rate of regimental pay and allowances and staff salary to which they would have been entitled under the old regulations if proceeding to sea on medical certificate. This information is necessary in order that no difficulty may arise in the Pay Department of the India Office in adjusting the several payments which may be due.\n\nOFFICERS OF H.M.'S SERVICE.\n\n27. Officers of Her Majesty's service in India, whether employed regimentally or in staff or detached situations, are entitled to the advantages above laid down in respect to allowances and tenure of office when on furlough or leave of absence.\n\n28. In the case of officers of Her Majesty's service on furlough or sick certificate, in England or elsewhere, who may retire or exchange into regiments not on the Indian establishment, the grant to these officers of Indian allowances will cease from the date of their retirement or exchange, if it take place before the expiration of six months from the date of quitting India.\n\nPERIODS OF ABSENCE ALLOWED TO BE COUNTED AS SERVICE FOR RETIRING PENSIONS.\n\n29. In order that all officers quitting India on furlough or sick certificate may be placed on an exact equality as regards loss of time, the period allowed by regulation for proceeding to the presidency, or to the nearest port of embarkation, as well as the time to enable officers to rejoin their corps or station after their return to India, will be considered as time counting for service for the retiring pension.\n\n30. No furlough or leave of absence, as announced in General Orders, exceeding two years in twenty years' aggregate service, three years in twenty-five years' service, and four years in thirty years' service, shall be allowed to count as service for the retiring pension; and no difference will be made in this respect between leave of absence taken in Europe or elsewhere, in or out of India, or whether the leave be on sick certificate or on private affairs.\n\n31. In the term \"Leave of Absence as announced in General Orders,\" is to be included all leave of absence, except the period allowed in Rule 29, and the ordinary indulgence of one month's leave in six months, as authorized by the existing regulations, and which are, in all cases, whether of regimental or staff officers, to be allowed to count as service for the pension. All leave to a greater extent, granted by political and other authorities, which may not hitherto have been published in General Orders, must be so announced hereafter.\n\n32. Officers to be entitled to retire on the full pay of their regimental rank (under the regulations of 1796), must have served twenty-two years in India, out of which leaves of absence for two years in the aggregate, and not more, will be allowed to count as service for the retiring pension.\n\n33. Officers to be entitled to retire on the full pay of captains and majors (under the regulations of 1835-37) must have served twenty and twenty-four years respectively; out of which time leaves of absence for two years in the aggregate, and not more will be allowed to count as service.\n\n34. Officers to be entitled to retire as lieutenant colonels must have served twenty-eight years; out of which leaves of absence for three years in the aggregate, and not more, will be allowed to count as service.\n\n35. Officers to be entitled to retire as colonels must have served thirty-two years; out of which leaves of absence for four years in the aggregate, and not more, will be allowed to count as service.\n\n36. The scale for medical officers and veterinary surgeons of privileged furlough and leave of absence as counting for the retiring pension, will be as follows:\n\n| Years. Months |\n|--------------|\n| 1 8 in 17 & under 20 years' service |\n| 2 0 in 20 \" 25 |\n| 3 0 in 25 \" 30 |\n| 4 0 in 30 \" 35 |\n| 5 0 in 35 \" 38 |\n| 6 0 in 38 years' service |\n\n37. It is to be distinctly understood, that under no circumstances whatever will an officer be permitted to retire on full pay until he has completed the full time of service above specified, whether he be in England at the close of his service or elsewhere.\n\n38. The privileged time of absence may, with the permission of the local government, be taken at any time, subject to these regulations. If, therefore, at the end of twenty years' service, of which eighteen had been passed on actual duty in India, an officer should be on furlough or sick certificate in Europe or elsewhere, he will be entitled to retire on the full pay of a captain without returning to India, and so in the other terms of service for the higher pensions. In like manner, a medical officer on furlough or sick certificate, in Europe or elsewhere, at the end of seventeen years' service, fifteen years and four months of which have been passed on actual duty in India, will be entitled to retire on the lowest rate pension, without returning to India, and so in the other terms of service for the higher pension.\n\n39. These rules do not in any way affect the existing regulations regarding the grant of leave in India, or for short periods to sea, whether on private affairs or on sick certificate, except as to the periods of such absence being taken into calculation in the time allowed to count as service for retirement on full pay.\n\n* For the periods allowed under Pension Regulations of 1881 see page lxviii.\nINDIAN MILITARY FURLough RULES OF 1868.\n\n(WITH SUBSEQUENT ALTERATIONS).\n\nGENERAL ORDER BY THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA, DATED 25th FEBRUARY, 1874, No. 171.\n\nThe rules previously in force will be designated, as heretofore, the Furlough Rules of 1796 and 1854.\n\nThe following G. G. O.'s are cancelled prospectively from the 1st January 1875:\n\nG. G. O. No. 630 of 1869 (1st clause).\nG. G. O. No. 627 of 1870.\nG. G. O. No. 613 of 1871.\n\n2. These rules are applicable to all officers who, on the 1st July, 1868, belonged to the several Indian Staff Corps, or to the Indian Army, and who have elected, or may elect, to adopt them: officers of the British Army who entered the Staff Corps after that date are of course subject to them.\n\nRules apply to Officers of Staff Corps and Indian Army.\n\n(2) In regard to the periods of leave of absence during which appointments may be held, and in regard to the increased allowances, they are also applicable to officers of the Royal Artillery and Royal Engineers, late of the Indian Army, holding permanent staff appointments not of a regimental nature, and to such officers of the Engineers of the Imperial Establishment as may be permanently employed or the staff in India.\n\nAlso to Officers of R. A. and R. E., late of Indian Army, when holding permanent non-regimental appointments.\n\n(3) But should an officer of the British Service, holding such permanent staff appointment, be allowed to proceed on leave under circumstances which, by these rules, would involve loss of appointment, he cannot take leave under them, but simply as a British Officer holding no appointment.\n\n3. These rules are not applicable to officers on the Invalid or Invalid Pension Establishment, even if previous to their transfer they should have elected them, being intended solely for officers on the effective list.\n\nDo not apply to Invalid Officers.\n\nThey are not applicable to Regimental Officers generally of the British Service, whether formerly belonging to the Indian Army, and now in the Royal Artillery, Royal Engineers, and new Line Regiments, or on the old Line Establishment, even though formerly of Indian Army.\n\nNote (1).\u2014British Medical Staff Officers holding administrative appointments in India tenable for 5 years, who are compelled by ill health to return to England, will be allowed by the Government of India in the Military Department to proceed there to appear before a Medical Board, and if reported unfit for further service in India, will be removed from the Indian Establishment; if otherwise, they may be allowed by the Secretary of State for India 6 months' leave on medical certificate on their Indian allowances and half staff.\n\nSuch Officers are also eligible for 4 months' leave on private affairs without pay, but only one grant of leave will be allowed out of India during their tenure of office.\n\nNote (2).\u2014All British officers holding Staff appointments in India, except the command of Divisions and Brigades, will be allowed, during their five years' tenure of office, only one grant of leave out of India either on medical certificate for six months with absentee allowances regulated under the furlough rules of 1868, or on private affairs for four months, with British pay, from Indian revenues. Any leave obtained in excess of either of these periods will involve loss of appointment.\n\n5. They are applicable to Officers of the Royal Engineers on the Imperial Establishment, who are employed in the Public Works Department, or who are receiving a staff salary as on the fixed establishment of the Sappers and Miners; these will count service towards furlough from the date of their arrival in India.\n\nApply to R. E. Officers on the Imperial list, holding permanent non-regimental staff appointments.\n\n(2.) These officers, therefore, and other Royal Engineer Officers of the Imperial list on permanent staff employ under the Government, will be entitled to a furlough of two years after eight years' service in India, or at the expiration of one year from the date of their return (for a second tour of service in India) on the completion of the prescribed home service after the first period of seven years' service in India.\n\n(3.) Such Officers will be allowed an advance of passage money, or free passage in a troop-ship if proceeding n the trooping season; the advance to be refunded on receipt of the balance of furlough pay. The English rate of pay of their rank only will be passed to them during their leave; but at its conclusion, on their presenting an order for them to return to India, the difference between that rate and furlough pay, less the passage money they have received, will be paid to them in England conditionally on its refund, if the order to return to India is not carried out.\n\n(4.) Those Royal Engineer Officers who arrived in India before the 1st July, 1872, are, however, not subject to the provisions of the preceding clause as long as they do not exchange Indian for home service, but draw furlough pay during furlough, as others.\n\nNote.\u2014Royal Engineers of the Imperial List may receive their pay while on furlough, either under the regulations in force before February, 1873, or under the terms of General Order No. 123 of 1873, that is to say, an officer of Engineers of the Imperial List may, at his option, on taking furlough to England, either receive furlough pay on the understanding that, should he not return to India, he will have to refund the difference between it and English pay, less the regulated amount of passage money, or a free passage and English pay only during the period of his furlough, the difference between English pay and furlough pay, less the cost of his passage, being issued to him upon his return to duty in India.\n\n2.\u2014The officer's choice should be made at the time of applying for furlough, and should be noted on his last pay certificate.\n\n(5.) An officer of the British Service, holding permanent staff employ under the Government, who may proceed on furlough under circumstances which involve the forfeiture of his appointment, must obtain the furlough as a British regimental officer, and it will reckon as a portion of the aggregate eight years of furlough on pay to which an officer is restricted during his service by Rule XVI. But, on again becoming permanently employed, he resumes the right of obtaining furlough under these rules.\n\n6. Officers of British Regiments who may join the Staff Corps can count as service towards furlough all their military service in India, provided that half of it (in no case less than four years) shall have been passed in the Staff Corps. But any leave to England they may have taken during service so counted will be reckoned as furlough already taken. Officers of the British Service who formerly belonged to the Indian Armies are exempted from the above proviso.\n\nPrevious service of Officers of the British Service who join Staff Corps, how reckoned towards furlough.\n7. These rules apply also to all Warrant Officers holding Veteran or Honorary Commissions, who may elect them; the period of service qualifying for furlough being calculated from the date of the attainment of a Commission. They will receive during furlough half their total receipts, calculated as laid down in Rule V., but without any reference to a minimum or maximum rate. Warrant Officers not holding Commissions can obtain furlough under these rules only on medical certificate.\n\n(2.) Such furlough may be for two years with retention of appointment and half of the aggregate allowances; but any extension of such leave (which will not be granted for more than one year in excess of the two years) or any leave taken within less than three years from the date of last return to duty, will be on \"English furlough pay.\" [See Note (1) to para. 9.]\n\n8. Every Warrant Officer who attained warrant rank before the 19th February, 1869, and who has not made his election, will be required, on the first occasion of his applying for leave out of India, to state whether he desires to take the leave under these rules, or under those previously in force applicable to Warrant Officers, viz., G. G. O. Nos. 518 and 531 of 1854, G. G. O. No. 1559 of 1857, and subsequent orders. That election will be considered final.\n\n(2.) Those who became Warrant Officers after 19th February, 1869, are subject to these rules, and cannot elect any of the previous rules.\n\n(3.) Leave on medical certificate on Indian pay and allowances to places eastward of the Cape, as allowed to Commissioned Officers under the Furlough Rules of 1796, is not in any case admissible to a Warrant Officer.\n\n(4.) These Rules respecting Warrant Officers apply to Honorary Assistant Surgeons and Warrant Officers in the Medical Department.\n\n9. The term \"Furlough Pay\" having now a changed and twofold significance, in all future orders and references \"Furlough Pay\" will be understood as the half Indian salary within the prescribed limits specified in paragraph V. of these rules, converted at the rate of exchange fixed by the Secretary of State for the official year, whilst \"English Furlough Pay\" will represent the rates heretofore allowed to the several grades as English pay under the rules of 1796 and 1854.\n\nNOTE (1).\u2014Where in these Rules English furlough pay is mentioned as that to which an officer is to be restricted, the rates laid down in paragraph 11 of G. G. O. No. 69, dated 22nd January, 1868, and (for Medical Warrant Officers) paragraph 22 of G. G. O. No. 550 of 1868, are to be understood as intended in the cases of Warrant Officers.\n\nNOTE (2).\u2014Officers who elected these rules prior to 1st July 1871, or before G. G. O. No. 588 of 1871 reached their stations, will receive furlough pay at the exchange of 2s. the rupee.\n\nRULES.\n\nI.\u2014The distinction with respect to allowances which has been hitherto drawn between furlough on private affairs and sick leave, is abolished, both kinds of leave being included under the general term furlough, provision, however, being made for the obtaining of furlough under medical certificate, without all the restrictions applicable to furlough when taken without medical certificate.\n\nII.\u2014Leave taken under the rules now prescribed will not involve forfeiture of appointment, except in the cases herein specially provided for.\n\n2. Officers of the Staff Corps and Local Indian Service, and Officers on the General List, can retain their appointments during all leave of absence granted by competent authority. But their pay during such absence will be the same as they would obtain under these rules had this exemption from forfeiture of appointment not been granted.\n\nNOTE.\u2014The above Rule is applicable to all Military and Medical Officers taking furlough or leave under these Regulations.\n\nIII.\u2014The Rules now prescribed do not affect the provisions of Act XXXIII. of George III., Chapter 52, Section 70*; but an absentee cannot retain his appointment and draw absentee allowances, except under the rules now prescribed. Nor do they affect the regulations by which General Officers Commanding Divisions and Brigades can only obtain limited periods of leave without forfeiting their Commands.\n\nIV.\u2014Leave of absence will in future be of three kinds, viz.:\u2014\n\nI.\u2014Furlough in or out of India.\n\nII.\u2014General leave on private affairs or sick certificate in India, or short leave to sea.\n\nIII.\u2014Privilege leave.\n\n* The section referred to is quoted below:\n\nSection 70.\u2014\"And be it further enacted that no person who shall have held any civil or military station whatever in India, in the service of the said United Company, being under the rank or degree of a Member of Council or Commander-in-Chief of the Forces, and who, having departed from India by leave of the Governor-General in Council, shall not return to India within the space of five years next after such departure, shall be entitled to any rank or restoration of office, or be capable of again serving in India, either in the European or Native Corps of Troops or in the civil line of the Company's Service, unless in the case of any Civil Servant of the Company, it shall be proved to the satisfaction of the Court of Directors that such absence was occasioned by sickness or infirmity, or, unless such person be permitted to return with his rank to India, by a vote or resolution passed by way of ballot by three parts in four of the proprietors assembled in General Court, specially convened for that purpose, whereof eight days' previous notice of the time and purpose of such meeting shall be given in The London Gazette, or unless, in the case of any Military Officer, it shall be proved to the satisfaction of the said Court of Directors and the Board of Commissioners for the affairs of India that such absence was occasioned by sickness or infirmity, or some inevitable accident.\"\nCHAPTER I.\n\nFurlough.\n\nV.\u2014An officer drawing staff pay in addition to pay of rank, proceeding on furlough, will be allowed pay at the rate of 50 per cent. of the salary of his substantive office.\n\nFurlough pay, how reckoned.\n\n2. But an officer in civil employ and drawing consolidated salary, will be allowed 50 per cent. of the average salary drawn by him during the three years prior to his proceeding on furlough, or during his actual service in India should that be less than three years; and the time spent and the allowances drawn during any leave other than \"privilege leave,\" will be omitted in the calculation of average salary.\n\n3. No absentee shall in either case draw more than \u00a31,000, or less than \u00a3250 per annum.\n\n4. The term \"salary\" will signify the total amount drawn by an officer, whether as consolidated pay, or staff allowances in addition to pay, but will not include any extra or special allowances. But in the case of a military officer in civil employ, his acting allowances shall be taken into account as a part of his salary in calculating his furlough pay.\n\nMeaning of term \"Salary.\"\n\n5. An officer absent on furlough, who may be transferred to another office during his absence, shall be entitled, for the entire period of his furlough, to furlough pay at the rate sanctioned to him when leaving India, whatever the salary of the office to which he may be transferred may be. This furlough pay will be continued to an officer in military employ after his return to India and until he joins his appointment, provided it is not less than the military pay, or pay and allowances, of his rank.\n\n6. But an officer whose term of office shall lapse, who shall vacate his appointment, or whose appointment shall be abolished during his furlough, will revert at once to the furlough pay which he would draw in virtue of his rank, as laid down below, in Section 8. Any case of sudden abolition of appointment may, however, be specially considered in the department of the Government under which the officer may have been employed. An officer will also be entitled to the benefit of his promotion to a higher Staff Corps or regimental rank, whilst on furlough, subject to the maximum limit.\n\nPay of Officers transferred to other appointments during furlough.\n\n7. Officers holding regimental medical charges will be allowed to retain such charges during the authorized periods of furlough, as if they were medical staff appointments. And the difference between the unemployed grade pay of the officer holding the substantive charge and the consolidated salary of the charge will be considered the staff salary divisible between the absentee and the officer officiating for him.\n\nMinimum furlough pay.\n\nNote.\u2014Officers who may be entitled to income allowance from the Military Fund during absence in Europe will draw their half salary or minimum absentee allowance under the foregoing clause, subject to a deduction equivalent to the amount of such income allowance.\n\nVI.\u2014All grants of furlough on private affairs are subject to the exigencies of the public service,\u2014of which exigency the Government is to be exclusively the judge,\u2014and to any regulations that may be found necessary for limiting the number of absentees.\n\nApplications of officers who cannot be spared need not be forwarded.\n\nAll furlough on private affairs subject to the exigencies of the service.\n\nNote.\u2014It is therefore within the competency of local Governments and of the Commander-in-Chief to decline to forward the application of any officer whose absence would, in their opinion, be detrimental to the interests of the public service, until such time as arrangements can be made for removing the difficulty; and it is the duty of the head of every department to decline to forward any application for furlough, whenever the services of the officer cannot be spared without risking the efficiency of the department, any doubtful case being referred for the orders of Government.\n\nVII.\u2014The maximum amount of furlough on private affairs to be taken at any one time, carrying pay and retention of appointment, will be two years: any extension of such furlough will be without pay unless it is on medical certificate, see Rule XIII. (But see Notes (3) and (4) Rule IX.) And no extension on private affairs beyond two years will be granted, though without pay, except upon satisfactory evidence of very urgent necessity.\n\nVIII.\u2014A period of at least three years' service to intervene between two furloughs.\n\nNote (1).\u2014An officer in civil employ cannot reckon in this interval of three years any period of absence from actual duty, excepting privilege leave.\n\nNote (2).\u2014Although furlough not exceeding 3 months taken by officers in civil employ is not considered as furlough requiring an interval of 3 years' duty, such furlough will be excluded from the period of 3 years' service required between two furloughs.\n\n2. But an officer who may be ordered to return to duty before the completion of his furlough for the purpose of proceeding on field service may be allowed to take the balance of such furlough at any time.\n\nException in cases of officers ordered out on field service.\n\nIX.\u2014An officer will be eligible for two years' furlough on the completion of eight years' actual service in India (see para. 6 of this order); for a third year after a further period of six years' actual service, and for a fourth and fifth year after similar intervals of six years, and so on, up to the maximum prescribed in Rule XVI. The grant of furlough to an officer eligible for it will be subject only to the conditions specified in Rules VI. and VII. But see notes to this Rule.\n\n* As modified by Army Circulars, India, July 1886, Clause 93.\n1.* Leave granted under these Rules, without furlough pay, will not reckon as furlough already taken in calculating the balance at an officer's credit, or as part of the total of eight years allowed as shown in Rule XVI, but all furlough with reckoned as \"furlough taken.\"\n\n2.* Furlough and leave previously taken under the Rules of 1796 or 1854, will count, as respects officers who have elected these Rules, as follows:\n\nHow far previous furlough bars furlough on private affairs.\n\nFurlough on private affairs, with pay, taken under the Rules of 1796 or 1854, counts in all respects as furlough.\n\nLeave on sick certificate, under the Rules of 1796, does not count in any respect as furlough.\n\nLeave on sick certificate, with pay, under the Rules of 1854, counts as part of the maximum of eight years allowed under these Rules, but until the maximum thus made up be reached, this leave will not count as furlough already taken in determining the amount of furlough to which an officer is entitled.\n\nLeave without pay under the Rules either of 1796 or 1854 does not count in any respects as furlough.\n\nN.B.\u2014Furlough on medical certificate with \"Furlough pay\" obtained by officers, under Rule IX., Note (1) of these Regulations, between the publication of G. G. Orders No. 171 of the 25th February, 1874, and No. 197 of the 1st March, 1877, will not be reckoned as \"Furlough already taken\" in computing the amount of furlough at the credit of such officers; but it will form part of the aggregate of eight years allowed to officers.\n\nNote (1).\u2014An officer of less than eight years' service in India may obtain furlough not exceeding two years, on medical certificate, with furlough pay and retention of appointment, provided he has been three years in the Staff Corps, or\u2014in the case of a Royal Engineer officer holding a permanent staff appointment, or an officer not in the Staff Corps\u2014has served for three years in India.\n\nNote (2).\u2014If the officer has not been three years in the Staff Corps, or served three years in India, as the case may be, he will receive \"English furlough pay\" only, and must vacate his appointment, unless entitled to retain it under Rule II.\n\nNote (3).\u2014This rule (in Note 2) and the provision in Note (1), however, are not applicable to officers of the Indian Army who entered the new Line Regiments, or Royal Artillery, and subsequently the Staff Corps.\n\nNote (4).\u2014Unemployed General Officers of the Staff Corps or local service can be granted furlough without serving the intervals of three and six years, respectively, prescribed in Rules VIII. and IX., and they can remain in Europe after they have exhausted the full period of furlough allowed during an officer's service by Rule XVI. (eight years on the whole) on the English furlough pay of their rank.\n\nNote (5).\u2014And a Major-General of the Staff Corps\u2014if he has so much furlough at his credit, and proceeds to England within a year of his being promoted to that rank, or of his ceasing to be employed\u2014can continue, after the expiration of the two years' furlough to receive half his Indian pay until he completes the period of three years during which he would be entitled to draw his Staff Corps pay if he were in India.\n\n3. If an officer appointed to any duty in England draws his Indian allowances, with or without any portion of his staff salary, he can count the period of such employment as service towards furlough; but if he is appointed to an office in England to which a fixed consolidated salary is attached, he cannot reckon the time of such employment as service towards furlough.\n\nX.\u2014An officer eligible for furlough need not take the whole amount to which his service entitles him, but may apply for any portion thereof as an instalment; and in that case the balance will remain at his credit in any future computation of the amount of furlough for which he may be eligible.\n\nIllustrations.\n\n1. An officer who has served nine years in India is entitled to two years' furlough: he takes only one year, and after his return remains in India for five years.\n\nHe is then eligible for two years' furlough as follows:\n\nTotal service in India.................................................................................................................. 14 years.\nFurlough due on that service........................................................................................................... 3 ,, .\nFurlough already taken.................................................................................................................... 1 year.\nBalance for which he is eligible ...................................................................................................... 2 years.\n\n2. An officer who has served 20 years in India without taking furlough is entitled to four years' furlough. He can only take, however, two years at one time carrying pay, the balance remaining at his credit in any future computation of furlough to which he may be entitled. He can take that balance after completing three years' service from the date of his return from the first instalment.\n\nNote.\u2014An officer is said to have furlough at his credit,\u2014even though he may not be able to obtain it owing to the number of absentees, or other causes,\u2014when the calculation of his service, as in illustration 1 above, shows a \"balance for which he is eligible.\"\n\n* XI.\u2014Furlough on urgent private affairs for six months on pay equivalent to the British regimental pay of his rank, may be granted when the officer has less than six months' furlough at his credit, or when from other causes, e.g. the number of absentees, or his not having served three years since his last return to duty, he is not able to take it. The said period may form part of the periods of either eight or six years referred to in Rule IX., and also\u2014except in the case of an officer in civil employ, see Rule VIII.(Note 1)\u2014of the three years which are required to intervene between two periods of furlough by Rule VIII.\n\n\u2020 Furlough under this article is not admissible to an officer in civil employ, who is eligible for the grant of special leave on urgent private affairs under the Civil Leave Code.\n\n2. This leave cannot be given in extension of any furlough, neither can it be extended beyond the six months unless on medical certificate; in which case the whole of the leave will be considered as if taken under Rule XIV., clause 1.\n\n* As modified in G. G. O. No. 197 of 1st March, 1877.\n\u2020 Army Circulars, India, July 1886, Clause 93.\nNOTE.\u2014Ill-health is not considered as warranting furlough under this rule to any officer who under the provisions of these rules can obtain furlough on medical certificate without forfeiting his appointment.\n\nXII.\u2014Subject to State considerations, there will be no restriction as to the places to which an officer may resort during furlough. But, if he desires to spend in England the rest of a \"furlough in India,\" or vice versa, he must obtain permission to do so from the Government of his Presidency, or from the Secretary of State for India, as the case may be; and on landing in either country, he must report his arrival accordingly to the Military Department of his own Presidency, or to the India Office, forwarding a copy of the permission granted him to change his destination. He must also communicate his address. An officer who, on his return to India, reports his debarkation, without forwarding at once a copy of the permission granted him to change his destination, or submitting an application for such permission, will be considered to have returned to his duty.\n\nXIII.\u2014Furlough on medical certificate is obtainable as indicated in Notes (1) and (2) of Rule IX. and in Rule XIV. Absence on such furlough for a longer period than two years at one time will involve forfeiture of appointment. [But see exceptions in Rule II.] Furlough may, however, be extended on medical certificate up to a third year on \"English furlough pay;\" and an officer on furlough on private affairs, who may be obliged to obtain an extension on medical certificate, will be thenceforward entitled to the same advantages, and subjected to the same disadvantages as to retention of appointment, pay, &c., as if he had originally obtained furlough on medical certificate.\n\nIf he exceeds three years' absence on medical certificate, the officer may have to retire or go on half-pay.\n\nExtension on medical certificate over three years to be without pay.\n\nOfficers on medical certificate must be pronounced fit for duty before returning to India.\n\nXIV.\u2014An officer whose health may necessitate his taking furlough within three years from the date of last return from any furlough except that taken for a period not exceeding six months under Rule XI. (and excepting also, in the case of an officer in civil employ, ordinary furlough not exceeding three months), may obtain under the usual medical certificate, such amount as may be duly certified to be necessary for the restoration of his health; but he will receive only \"English furlough pay,\" and must vacate any appointment he may be holding, unless entitled to retain it under Rule II.\n\n2. If, however, he shall have served three years since the date of his last return to duty, although there may be no balance of furlough at his credit, he will be entitled, on obtaining furlough on medical certificate, to retain his appointment and to receive \"furlough pay,\" as laid down in Rule V., for the entire period not exceeding two years. Should the latter period be exceeded, he will come under the provisions of Rule XIII.\n\nXV.\u2014An officer entitled to furlough, or having a balance of furlough at his credit, whose health may necessitate his absence from India, must take the leave as furlough under Rule IX., but without forfeiting any passage-money to which he may be entitled under Military Fund Rules;\u2014or, if a Subaltern, by Regulation, when proceeding on medical certificate.\n\n2. Should the officer be declared fit for duty before the expiration of two years, he may be granted extension on private affairs up to that limit, provided that he has so much at his credit, and that if he remains he will not be in excess of the established proportion of absentees. Any extension on private affairs of such furlough beyond the said period of two years, must be without pay.\n\n3. Any extension on medical certificate of furlough under this rule beyond two years must be on \"English furlough pay\" under Rule XIII.\n\nXVI.\u2014The aggregate amount of furlough with pay and retention of appointment, on private affairs and on medical certificate, that may be granted to an officer during his service will be limited to eight years.\n\nNOTE 1.\u2014This aggregate is calculated agreeably to clauses 1 and 2 of Rule IX.\n\nNOTE 2.\u2014Furlough allowed by proper authority to reckon as service for pension under the provisions of G. G. O.'s No. 1113 of 1857, and 95 of 1866, or in consequence of an officer's employment on any duty during his furlough, will not reckon as part of the aggregate period of eight years.\n\n* XVII.\u2014If taken in India, furlough is reckoned from the date of the absentee's quitting his station to that of his return thereto. If taken out of India, furlough commences from the date on which the vessel on which the officer embarks quits her moorings or anchorage, whether she leaves the limits of the port or not, and terminates on the day immediately preceding that on which the vessel on which he returns to India drops her anchor or is moored at any Indian port. An officer's furlough begins on the vessel's departure from any Indian port at which he first joins her, and ends on the day before her arrival at the port where he last quits her.\n\nNOTE 1.\u2014Furlough out of India taken before the 17th November, 1883, reckoned from the date of the sailing of the vessel on which any officer embarked, or (if from Calcutta) the date on which she left the Sandheads to the date of disembarkation, the latter being considered as a day of duty. (But see exception in Note 2).\n\n* Army Circulars, India, 1882, Clause 58.\nNOTE 2.\u2014From the 4th April, 1870, to the 14th September, 1874, inclusive, the date of disembarkation was reckoned as a day of furlough and not of duty.\n\nNOTE 3.\u2014The furlough of an officer ordered to India before its expiration for special duty or on account of the exigencies of the service terminates on the day previous to that of his embarkation for India from any port in England or the Continent of Europe. When the officer avails himself of the balance of his furlough, it commences on the day of his first landing either in England or on the Continent of Europe.\n\nXVIII.\u2014Subsidiary leave to embark for Europe or elsewhere on furlough will be granted for any period deemed necessary, not ordinarily exceeding 30 days. Leave up to the same limit, to enable him to rejoin on his return from furlough, will be granted from the date of his disembarkation in India. This applies equally to furloughs taken under Rule XI. The authority which has power to grant subsidiary leave can, on due cause being shown, grant any necessary extension of it, but this can be done only on very sufficient reasons.\n\nNote (1)\u2014The words \"with the necessary subsidiary leave\" will be added to the G. G. O. granting an officer furlough, and will be understood to mean both the leave granted before embarkation for Europe, and on return.\n\nNote (2).\u2014An officer obtaining a furlough on private affairs or medical certificate must embark within three months of the date of the General Order which notifies it, or take up the first portion of his furlough in India until he embarks; if not, the General Order will cease to have effect. The only exception to this rule that can be allowed is when the officer is prevented from embarking within the three months owing to his detention in India by proper authority on bona fide public grounds. If, however, the officer does not, within a reasonable time, avail himself of the furlough given him, his subsequently being placed on duty rendering his detention necessary will not exempt him from the rule; and in every case of such detention the officer must at once report it, and he is not to embark after the expiration of three months until he has applied for and obtained from the Government of his Presidency an extension of the period.\n\nNote (3).\u2014Officers who may be serving in other Presidencies than their own, if they desire to embark bona fide for Europe from the latter, may obtain subsidiary leave accordingly, and their furlough will reckon from the date of their embarkation at their own Presidencies.\n\nApplication for furlough, how submitted. N.B.\u2014For full information as to the submission of applications for furlough, see Bengal Army Regulations, Sect. 13.\n\nNote (4).\u2014The allowances of Military officers in civil employ during subsidiary leave, and after return to India until they rejoin their appointments, will be adjusted according to Civil Rules.\n\nLeave preparatory to retirement. Note (5).\u2014Leave preparatory to retirement from the service does not reckon as service towards pension.\n\nNote (6).\u2014An officer unavoidably detained at the Presidency for passage in a troopship, beyond the usual subsidiary leave, shall count the period of such detention as subsidiary leave.\n\nPay issued monthly in India, quarterly in England. XIX.\u2014Furlough allowances are payable monthly if payment is taken in India, and quarterly if payment is taken in England.\n\nXX.*\u2014Advances of furlough pay will continue to be made in India to those officers who desire it for three months from date of embarkation. Payments in continuation will be made in England on the expiration of six months from that date.\n\nXXI.\u2014The last pay certificate issued to each officer who may be granted furlough, whether on private affairs or on medical certificate, will specify the rate of the pay and staff salary of his last substantive appointment, and the rate to which he will be entitled in Europe in virtue of Rule V.\n\nXXII.+\u2014An Officer acting in India for an absentee on furlough pay will be restricted, for the entire period that he may so act, to the half staff salary of the appointment in which he may be acting, in addition to the full pay of his rank, and the half staff salary of his own appointment, if he possess one. The aggregate staff salary granted to an acting officer in such cases will not be less than Rs. 100 per mensem, unless the full staff salary of the post in which he is officiating is less than that sum.\n\nPay of Warrant Officers acting for others on furlough. 2. A Warrant Officer acting for one of a higher grade on furlough receives half of the aggregate allowances of the absentee, added to half of the aggregate of his own allowances.\n\n\u2020 Note.\u2014The indulgence granted by the above rule is only allowed to one directly officiating in the place of the officer absent on furlough, not to one acting in the room of an officer who is himself acting for an absentee on furlough.\n\nPeriods of furlough, &c., counting as service towards pension.\u2021\u2021 XXIII.\u2014The privilege heretofore granted to Military and Medical Officers who had elected the Rules of 1854, of counting certain periods of leave as service for pension, is retained, and is applicable to those who elect these rules subject to the condition laid down in \u00a7 4 of Rule XXXIV.\n\n* For advances on return to duty see page lxxv.\n\u2020 As modified in G.G.O. 585 of 1874.\n\u2021 Added by G.G.O.

Warrant Officers obtaining that rank after the 24th August 1872, can only reckon as service towards pension the following periods of leave whether taken in or out of India:\n\n- 15 months in 12 years' Departmental Service.\n- 20 \" \" 14 \"\n- 24 \" \" 16 \"\n\n3. Those who were promoted to warrant rank before that date are allowed to continue, if they prefer it, on the old rule, and reckon all leave in India as service, all out of India being deducted from their service, for pension.\n\nIllustration of the mode of computing service for pension in any case.\n\nTotal service from date of arrival in India, say ........................................... 30 years.\n\nLeave\u2014 Years.

The balance within the limit of eight years total furlough on private affairs and medical certificate laid down in Rule XVI., will represent the leave to which he will be entitled on the expiration of not less than three years from his last return to duty. (See Sections 1 and 2 of Rule IX.)\n\nIllustration.\n\n(1).\u2014An officer, who had obtained under the existing rules two years' furlough after ten years' service, returns to India on the date on which this order is promulgated. He accepts its conditions and serves four years longer in India.

During the entire period of his absence on this account the officer will be entitled, as at present, to his full pay and a moiety of his staff salary. Leave taken under this rule will form no part of the eight years' aggregate furlough. If this indulgence should be taken advantage of for a third year consecutively the officer will lose his staff appointment unless entitled to retain it under Rule II.\n\nXXVI.\u2014Leave on sick certificate for a period exceeding six months, capable of extension, under renewed medical certificate, to a limit of one year, may be granted to any officer who, in the opinion of a Medical Board, may require it. Leave of this nature, taken after the promulgation of these rules, will be held to constitute a part of the maximum period of eight years' leave of absence to which an officer is entitled in his entire period of service, but will not be regarded as furlough, nor will it affect the intervals entitling to furlough laid down in Rule IX. During this leave the absentee will draw a moiety of his staff salary in addition to the pay of his rank. But if the 12 months be exceeded, the whole leave must be reckoned as furlough, and allowances be adjusted accordingly.\n\nXXVII.\u2014Short leave, not exceeding three months, on private affairs or sick certificate, may also be taken to sea, on the above condition, but absence from India for any longer period will be treated as furlough.\n\nXXVIII.\u2014All general leave taken in India counts as part of the leave reckoning against service for pension.\nXXIX.\u2014Privilege leave may be granted, as at present, for sixty days in each year to all officers in military employ, without deduction from the salaries and emoluments drawn by them. General leave, in extension of privilege leave, can only be granted on the ground of sickness, or some other serious emergency which could not have been foreseen when the officer proceeded on privilege leave. Privilege leave may, however, be converted into general leave with the sanction of the Commander-in-Chief or the Government.\n\nNote (1).\u2014Privilege leave for ninety days, after thirty-three months' duty, which may be spent anywhere, in or out of India, is admissible to Commissioned and Warrant Officers under these Rules; but to claim the privilege, it shall be necessary for an officer to show that he has had no privilege leave for thirty-three months previous to the date of his application, and that he has made satisfactory arrangements for the performance of his duties during his absence at no additional cost to the State. If leave for a shorter period than 90 days is taken, the balance is forfeited.\n\nNote (2).\u2014Officers are not required to report themselves to the India Office should they go to England, but it will be incumbent on them to keep their departmental superiors in India acquainted with their address.\n\nXXX.\u2014In the case of the stations noted in the margin, privilege leave may, as at present, be granted for ninety days to officers of local Corps, or of Corps which are usually employed in one or other of the districts named.\n\nAssam. Khairwara. Dera Ghazee Khan.\nShillong. Khotra. Rajapore.\nErinpoora. Bumnoo. Jacobabad.\nDeolee. Dera Ismael Khan.\n\nNote.\u2014The above rule is not applicable to officers of regiments moved in course of relief to any of the stations, or who are only temporarily employed there.\n\nXXXI.\u2014An officer is at liberty to proceed wherever he may desire on privilege leave, provided he can ensure his return before the expiration of his leave.\n\nXXXII.\u2014Privilege leave cannot be taken in continuation of furlough, nor can furlough be obtained in continuation of privilege leave. If furlough be obtained by an officer while absent on privilege leave, the privilege leave will be converted into general leave, the officer for that period sacrificing a moiety of his staff salary.\n\nMilitary Officers in Civil Employ.\n\nXXXIII.\u2014Those Military Officers (including Warrant Officers who hold Honorary, Veteran, or Unattached Commissions) in Civil or Political employ who may elect these rules when they take leave in India, come, as respects periods of leave obtainable and amount of pay to be granted, under the Civil Leave Rules. When they take leave out of India, they come under the Military Leave Rules. (See however Rule XL.)\n\nNote.\u2014Furlough in India is allowed under Chapter I of these rules to a Military Officer in civil employ, under the same chapter, by the Government to which he is subordinate; as also subsidiary, privilege, and examination leave under the rules in the Civil Leave Code; but under no circumstances will he be allowed any leave out of India under the Civil Leave Code, but under Military rules and by the Military Department.\n\nWhen furlough in India is required by a Military Officer in civil employ, he must obtain from the Military Department, and submit to the Accountant General a \"Furlough certificate;\" and when furlough is granted by the Government to which the officer is subordinate, a copy of the order granting the furlough should be sent to the Military Department.\n\n(2.) For subsidiary leave, see Note (5) of Rule XVIII.\n\nSubsidiary Rule.\n\nXXXIV.\u2014Officers of the Indian Military and Medical services will be required generally to notify their intention to accept these rules or to adhere to those now existing, on the first occasion of their taking furlough or general leave after the publication of this order. Such election must be considered final, and under no plea whatever will an officer be subsequently relieved from the choice thus made.\n\n2. Officers going home under these Rules will pay English rates of subscription only to the Military Fund.\n\n3. Officers who may determine to abide by existing Rules will be allowed to proceed on furlough on the conditions laid down in Rules VII., VIII., and XIII. to the extent to which they may be entitled under the Furlough Regulations of 1854, or of 1796, whichever of the two they may have elected, and on the rates of pay contemplated in those Regulations, but retaining their appointments. The principle laid down in Rule XV. must, however, be applied in those cases.\n\n4. If an officer under the Furlough Rules of 1796 elects the present Rules, his service for pension will be reckoned under the former Rules up to 1st July, 1868, and thenceforward under the Rules of 1868; and the fact of the officer having been on furlough on 1st July, 1868, and not then having elected the Rules of 1868, will not affect the case. All periods of leave out of Indian limits taken previous to 1st July, 1868, will be wholly excluded from his service for pension; but he may reckon towards pension periods of leave taken subsequent to that date, according to the length of his service counting for pension, as shown in Rule XXIII.\n\nRetirement under 1796 Rules not affected.\n\nPrevious service of officers under 1796 Rules how reckoned.\n\n5. His election of these Furlough Rules in no way affects his right to retire under the Pension Rules of 1796.\nMILITARY FURLOUGH REGULATIONS.\n\nFURLOUGH AND LEAVE RULES OF 1875.\n\n(WITH SUBSEQUENT ALTERATIONS.)\n\nG.G.O. No. 1,316, dated 30th December, 1875.\n\nI. Officers included in Schedule A may receive, after five years' service in India or under the Government of India, one year's furlough, and an additional year for each subsequent five years' service. Furlough not taken at the time it becomes due is not lost, and can, subject to these rules, be taken later.\n\nNOTE.\u2014Service for furlough under these rules, in the case of an officer electing them, is reckoned from the date of his election. (See also Notes 2 and 3 to Schedule A.)\n\nII. An Officer may receive at any time any portion of the furlough to which he is entitled; but, except under Rule 8, he may not be absent from duty on any ground for more than three years consecutively; nor, on return from furlough, may he receive, except under Rule 6, any further portion of the furlough to which he is entitled until after the interval of two years.\n\nIII. It must be distinctly understood that furlough is subject to the exigencies of the public service. Officers commanding regiments, and Heads of Departments, will forward no application for furlough unless able to satisfy the superior authorities that the Officer's service can be spared without any inconvenience to the public service.\n\nIV. Furlough does not involve forfeiture of appointment, may be spent anywhere, and counts as service for pension. (See Rule VIII.)\n\nV.* A commissioned Officer on furlough receives (up to, but not beyond, the sum of \u00a31,000 a year) half the emoluments of his office, computed according to a rate of exchange to be fixed in each year by the Secretary of State; but in any case he does not receive less than \u00a3250 a year. The emoluments of his office include all pay, staff corps pay, staff salary, and Indian allowances he would receive in respect to it if he were on duty, and for the purpose of each payment his office is the office he fills on the day when that payment becomes due.\n\nVI. A Warrant Officer receives half the emoluments of his office calculated in the same manner as those of Commissioned Officers, no Warrant Officer, however, receiving as furlough pay less than the English furlough pay of his rank.\n\nVI. Upon certificate of a Medical Board, an Officer not entitled to furlough, if he has served not less than two years in India may receive it for any period not exceeding two years; but such furlough will be deducted from his next accruing furlough until it is paid off. An Officer will not be allowed to anticipate furlough under this rule to an aggregate amount of more than two years.\n\nNOTE.\u2014An Officer of less than two years' service from date of coming under the new rules, falling sick, will be sent to England on medical certificate, on English furlough pay, without the period of his furlough being fixed, subject to the decision of Her Majesty's Government as to his ultimate disposal; a special report on each case being submitted to her Majesty's Government by the Government of India, or in the case of Officers of the Madras or Bombay army by the Government of those Presidencies. (See notes 2 and 3 to Schedule A.)\n\nI. Furlough on medical certificate under this rule (except in the case of Officers invalided home for sickness due to wounds, or other cause, solely attributable to active service in the field) does not count as service for pension until it has been paid off as provided for in the rule; when due solely to active service in the field it is allowed to reckon as service for pension without being paid off as provided for under ordinary circumstances in the rule; but it does not count as service for furlough; i.e., an officer obtaining it shall still be required to put in the full Indian service qualifying for furlough under the Rules of 1875, with the condition also that he shall complete two years' further service in India before availing himself of it.\n\n\u2020\u2020 An officer serving under the Regulations of 1875, who has been allowed to count as service for pension any furlough taken under Rule VI., due to active service in the field, under the provisions of India Army Circulars, Clause 170 of 1881, and Clause 41 of 1882, may, should the circumstances of the case warrant the indulgence, be again permitted to anticipate furlough to an amount of not more than two years in all, under Rule VI. In all cases of the grant of furlough under the foregoing ruling a special report is to be made to the Secretary of State.\n\n\u2021\u2021 All furlough due to wounds or illness solely attributable to active service in the field shall be treated as \"extraordinary furlough,\" reckoning as service for pension and not subject to repayment. The rules published in clause 154 India Army Circulars of 1881 and Clause 112 of 1883 will govern the grant of the above concession, and the maximum amount of furlough to be treated as \"extraordinary furlough\" will be two years.\n\nVII. An Officer who has exhausted the furlough obtainable under these rules, and who may be certified by a Medical Board to be still unfit for duty, will be placed temporarily or permanently on half-pay, according to the circumstances of the case.\n\nVIII. Under very urgent circumstances, special furlough may be granted for private affairs, which need not be paid back; but it will be in all cases without any kind of pay, and will not count for pension.\n\nNOTES.\u2014The amount of leave which may be granted under this rule will be restricted to such period as the Government granting it is satisfied is actually necessary with reference to the urgency of the case.\n\nIX.\u2014Officers and Warrant Officers proceeding on furlough to Europe may, if they desire it, receive an advance equivalent to three months' furlough pay.\n\nX. Leave may be granted for any period not exceeding six months at a time, and may not, except for very urgent reasons, to be specially reported to the Government of India, be renewed till after six months have elapsed from its expiration. It must be spent at some place east of the 40th degree of east longitude. Subject to these conditions, it may be granted or refused entirely at the discretion of the local authorities, who in granting it shall fix its duration, and may fix the limits within which it shall be spent, and whether during its continuance half-pay and allowances are to be deducted for the payment of a substitute; and they may grant it as preparatory to furlough, or for the purpose of a medical examination. Leave counts as service for pension and furlough. The local authorities shall be defined for the purpose of this rule by the Government of India.\n\n* As modified by G.G.O. No. 440 of 11 May, 1877.\n\u2020 Rulings contained in G.G.O. No. 1,110 of 27 Oct., 1876.\n\u2021 Rulings contained in G.G.O.

No. 1,110 of 27 Oct. 1876.\n\u00a7\u00a7 For advances on return to duty, see page lxxv.\nXI. Leave and furlough are reckoned from and to the close of the days named in the order granting them.\n\nNote.\u2014And after the 17th November, 1883, the day on which the vessel on which an officer proceeds on furlough quits her moorings or anchorage, whether she leaves the limits of the port or not on that day, will be reckoned as the date of the commencement of his furlough, and as a day of the furlough; and the date, on which the vessel on which he returns to India drops her anchor or is moored at any Indian port, will be reckoned as a day of duty. An officer's furlough begins on the vessel's departure from any Indian port at which he first joins her, and ends on the day before her arrival at the port at which he last quits her.\n\nXII. The position of Officers not included in Schedule A will be unchanged as respects leave or furlough.\n\nXIII. Officers now in the service placing themselves, from a given date, under these rules, shall count service for pension up to that date under the rules to which they were then subject.\n\nNote.\u2014An officer takes with him so much service for pension as he had become entitled to under former rules.\n\nWhen, however, officers joining the Staff Corps have joined with less than 20 years' service under the rules of 1854 or 1868, before coming under these rules, they shall, after completing 20 years' service in all, be permitted to count as service for pension a proportion of any furlough or leave they may have taken under earlier rules, at the rate of two years' leave for 20 years' service, or one-tenth. Thus, an officer who, before coming under the rules of 1875, had a service of 14 years and 99 days, of which 2 years 142 days were on leave under the rules of 1868, would count one year and 156 days' leave, and would have 13 years 113 days' total service for pension.\n\nSCHEDULE A.\n\nOfficers entering the Staff Corps or Indian Medical Service, and Warrant Officers attaining that rank, after the 31st December, 1875; and\n\nAny other officers, Commissioned or Warrant, belonging to the Indian Army or Medical Service, or Officers of the Staff Corps, who, after the 31st of December, 1875, shall, before asking for leave or furlough, apply in writing to their Local Governments to be placed definitively upon this Schedule; but their service for furlough under Rule I. shall commence from the date of such entry or such application respectively.\n\nNote 1.\u2014The date of entry into the Staff Corps is that of entry for choice of furlough rules, viz., the date on which the Officer was originally appointed on probation. An Officer, therefore, whose date of admission to the Staff Corps is not after the 31st December, 1875, will have the choice of rules, but an Officer whose date of admission is after that date will have no option.\n\nNote 2.\u2014Officers compulsorily placed under these regulations on entering the Staff Corps, will be allowed to count their previous military service in India towards furlough, provided they shall have served five years in India, of which not less than half shall have been in the Staff Corps; but any leave out of India on private affairs taken by such furlough service so counted will be reckoned as furlough taken under Rule I., and any leave taken on medical certificate will be reckoned as taken under Rule VI.\n\nShould, therefore, an officer, who took sick leave out of India whilst in the British service, again require leave on medical certificate on his admission to the Staff Corps, and proceed under Rule VI., he will be granted, in the first instance, only so much furlough as will complete the period admissible under that rule. This furlough may be extended to two years on \"English furlough pay,\" but it will rest with Her Majesty's Government to determine whether any, and if so, what, extension shall be granted.\n\nNote 3.\u2014Warrant Officers promoted to that grade after the 31st December, 1875, and thus compulsorily brought under these rules, will be allowed to count their previous service for furlough under Rule VI.; but furlough is not to be granted under this rule until a Warrant Officer has completed two years' service since his last return to duty from furlough as a Non-Commissioned Officer, otherwise he can only be granted leave under the note to Rule VI.\n\nNote 4.\u2014An Officer electing these regulations, and having furlough to his credit under previous rules, forfeits such furlough absolutely, he being required to serve five years from date of such election to entitle him to one year's furlough, unless it be sick furlough. An Officer similarly circumstanced, but having furlough to his debit, is equally with the others entitled to take on year's furlough five years after electing the new rules.\n\nAny Officers in civil employment declared by the Government of India to be under civil leave rules shall not be under these rules.\n\n***\n\nThe last pay certificate issued to an Officer to whom furlough or leave has been granted shall state the pay to which, under Rule V., he is at that date entitled in respect to the office he is holding, noticing the date, if any fixed, at which he will vacate it.\n\nSUBSIDIARY RULES.\n\nWith advertence to the foregoing rules, the Right Honorable the Governor-General in Council is pleased to notify\u2014\n\nI. That no \"extra or special allowances\" drawn by an officer, which are now excluded from the account in calculating furlough pay under the Rules of 1868, can be reckoned in calculating furlough pay under these Rules (Rule V.).\n\nII. That the Governments of the three Presidencies, or their Excellencies the Commanders-in-Chief, in regard to Officers serving directly under them, shall be held to be the \"local authorities\" named in Rule X.\n\nIII. That, pending further orders, a Staff Officer granted leave under Rule X. shall receive, as heretofore, the pay or staff corps pay of his rank, and half the staff salary of his appointment during such leave; but full staff salary may be allowed him for the first two months (as now during privilege leave) when he makes approved arrangements for the performance of his duties during that period. In such cases the G. O. granting the leave must state that the first two months are to be on full staff pay.\n\n* (2). The leave up to sixty days in each year on full Staff pay under the foregoing rule may be taken either for the full time or by instalments, in the same way as privilege leave under other furlough rules is taken, the condition that six months must elapse between the return of an officer to duty and the grant of a fresh period of leave not being enforced in respect of such leave of absence.\n\nNote 1.\u2014Privilege leave for 90 days, after 33 months' duty, which may be spent anywhere in or out of India, is admissible to Commissioned and Warrant Officers under these rules; but to claim the privilege it shall be necessary for an officer to show that he has had no leave on full Indian pay and allowances for 33 months previous to the date of his application, and that he has made satisfactory arrangements for the performance of his duties during his absence, at no additional cost to the State. If leave for a shorter period than 90 days is taken, the balance is forfeited.\n\nNote 2.\u2014Officers are not required to report themselves to the India Office should they go to England; but it will be incumbent on them to keep their departmental superiors in India acquainted with their address.\n\nNote 3.\u2014No furlough or leave out of India, if exceeding six months, can be counted as part of the required 33 months' duty; but an officer who may have 33 months' service at credit before proceeding on such\n\n\u2020 Rulings contained in G.G.O. No. 23 of 10 Jan. 1879.\n* Army Circulars, India, Jan., 1883, Clause 12.\nfurlough or leave (in excess of six months) may be allowed to take accumulated privilege leave on his return, if he can be spared.\n\nNote 4.\u2014Warrant Officers proceeding out of India on privilege leave under Note 1 must deposit the amount of their return passage money, or give security for the payment of the same.\n\nNote 5.\u2014General Officers Commanding Divisions, Districts and Brigades are not eligible for the 90 days' privilege leave referred to in the above Note 1.\n\n7th December, 1877.\n\nNo. 1,102 of 1877.\u2014His Excellency the Governor General in Council is pleased to notify the following supplementary regulations, which have received the approval of the Right Honourable the Secretary of State for India, providing for the case of Military Officers in Civil employ, referred to in paragraph IV. of the subsidiary rules appended to G.G.O. No. 1,316 of the 30th December, 1875:\n\nI. Any Officer now in Civil employ, who is subject to the Military Furlough Regulations of 1854 or 1868, shall remain so subject.\n\nII. Any Military Officer who may hereafter enter Civil employ, who is not already subject to the Military Furlough and Leave Rules of 1875, shall remain subject to the rules applicable to him when he enters Civil employ.\n\nNote.\u2014An Officer referred to in Rules I. and II. cannot elect the Military Furlough and Leave Rules of 1875, so long as he continues in Civil employ.\n\nIII. Any Officer who may enter Civil employ, who is already subject to the Military Furlough and Leave Rules of 1875, shall be subject to the rules in the Civil Leave Code applicable to covenanted civil servants, both as regards furlough and leave taken out of India and in India.\n\nIV. If any Officer, who is employed in the civil administration, has taken furlough in the Military Department under the said rules of 1875, this furlough shall be treated, in calculating the furlough or special leave admissible to him under the preceding rule, as if it had been furlough taken under the Civil Leave Code. Leave so taken under the 10th Military Rule shall be treated as if it had been privilege leave taken under the Civil Leave Code, and the claims of the Officer under the Civil Leave Code adjusted accordingly.\n\nV. If an Officer, who has been subject to the rules in the Civil Leave Code under the third of these rules, is again employed in the Military Department, and so again becomes subject to the Military Furlough and Leave Rules of 1875, any furlough or special leave taken by him under the Civil Leave Code will be treated in calculating the furlough admissible to him under the said military rules as if it had been furlough taken under the said military rules. Privilege leave taken under the Civil Leave Code Rules will be treated as if it had been leave taken under the 10th Military Rule. Subsidiary or examination leave taken under the Civil Leave Code will not affect the claims of such an Officer under the Military Furlough and Leave Rules.\n\nLEAVE RULES FOR THE INDIAN STAFF CORPS.\n\n(Published in Army Circulars, India, 16 April 1886.)\n\n1. An officer may be granted,\u2014Privilege leave under such regulations as may from time to time be in force.\n\nLeave out of India, for no longer period than one year, capable of extension to two years' absence from duty, on the following pay:\u2014\n\nAfter appointment to the Staff Corps \u00a3200 a year.\n\nAfter the commencement of the 5th years' service for pension ... 250\n\nDitto, ditto, 15th ditto, ditto ... 300\n\nDitto, ditto, 20th ditto, ditto ... 450\n\nDitto, ditto, 25th ditto, ditto ... 600\n\nDitto, ditto, 30th ditto, ditto ... 700\n\nLeave in India, but for the period of one year only, on full military pay and half the Staff salary of appointment.\n\n2. No extension of leave involving absence from duty for more than two years, whether taken in or out of India, can be granted except on specially urgent grounds and without pay.\n\n3. An officer, unable on account of the state of his health to return to duty within the maximum period of two years' absence, will, unless he is under Rule 2 specially granted an extension of leave without pay, be placed on temporary half pay or the retired list, as the circumstances of the case may seem to require. An officer will also be liable to be placed on half pay or the retired list should his health require an undue amount of leave, whether in or out of India. This power will be exercised at the instance of the Government of his own Presidency should the officer be in India, or, should he be at home, by the Secretary of State in Council.\n\n4. All leave in or out of India will count as service for pension.\n\n5. Leave, whether it is leave in India or leave out of India, will not involve forfeiture of appointment, and may be granted at any time, but solely at the discretion of the Commanders-in-Chief of the several armies for officers serving directly under their orders, and by the Governor-General in Council or the Governors in Council for officers of civil departments of the Army, or of Corps not under the direct orders of a Commander-in-Chief.\n\n6. An officer on leave, whether in India or out of India, will be required to rejoin at once on being recalled to duty, unless certified by a Medical Board as unfit to do so.\n\n7. The above rules shall apply to\u2014\n\nOfficers whose admission to the Staff Corps shall bear date subsequent to the 30th June 1886.\n\nOfficers of the Staff Corps, including probationers, or of the Cavalry and Infantry lists of the Indian Army, in military employment, who may elect them within twelve months of that date. Officers applying for leave of any kind within that period must elect on making their application. Officers already on leave at date of promulgation must elect at once, and the new rules will apply to them from the date on which their notification of acceptance shall be received at either army headquarters or by the Government of India, or by the Local Governments, or at the India Office at home, as the case may be.\n\nOfficers in civil employ on that date, subsequently reverting to military duty, who may elect them within six months from the date of being replaced at the disposal of the Military Department, and such officers who may be on leave when so replaced must make their election at once. Those taking leave within the six months must make their election before going on leave.\nThey shall not apply to\u2014\n\nOfficers in civil employ.\n\nOfficers commanding divisions, districts, or brigades, or holding other appointments under special regulations as to leave of absence, who will continue subject to such regulations.\n\n8. Officers who, under Rule 7, elect to come under these will count all previous leave as service for pension. The position of those who do not so elect will remain unchanged.\n\n9. The Secretary of State in Council reserves the right of making any change in the foregoing regulations which circumstances may retire.\n\nDECISIONS ON THE LEAVE RULES FOR THE STAFF CORPS.\n\n(Published in India Army Circulars, 20th August 1886.)\n\n1. Officers in civil employment, while they continue in such employment, are not affected by these rules; but if desirous of retiring on pension direct from such employment, they will, whether on duty or on furlough, be given the benefit of the rule which allows all previous leave to count as service for pension.\n\nIt is, however, to be clearly understood that no officer in civil employment will be allowed to place himself out of employment for the purpose of taking leave under these rules, or for any purpose but immediate retirement.\n\n2. There is no subsidiary leave under these rules, and leave will commence from the date of an officer's being struck off duty, and he will be required to rejoin his appointment within the period of his leave.\n\n3. The term \"struck off duty\" applies to the date of an officer's quitting his regiment or appointment, and not to the date of his embarkation.\n\nUp to date of embarkation and from date of return to India to date of rejoining regiment or department, officers granted leave out of India under the new rules will receive Indian pay and half staff salary.\n\n4. The Indian Pension Regulations are unaffected by the new leave rules, except that all leave from date of commencement of service for pension will, under those rules, be allowed to count as service for pension.\n\n5. Time passed at Addiscombe after the attainment of the age of 16 years will reckon as service for pension in calculating the rates of pay under Rule I. of the new rules.\n\n6. The periods of service for pension in Rule I. of the leave rules will entitle an officer taking leave to the pay fixed for such periods of service, without any limitation based on the rule* which prevents an officer from retiring on the pension fixed for a particular period of service, unless he has served half of that service in the Staff Corps.\n\n7. Officers referred to in G. G. O. Nos. 209 of 1882, 192 of 1883, and 432 of 1884, who, on vacating their regimental commands or staff, departmental, and other appointments, may reside out of India until qualified for the highest pension or the Colonel's allowance, will, if they elect to come under the new leave rules, be allowed, during such absence from India, the pay admissible under Rule I. of those rules.\n\nThe limit of absence from duty imposed by the new leave rules will not be held applicable to these officers.\n\n8. The provisions of the rules with regard to duration of leave do not apply to probationers for the Staff Corps.\n\n9. The limit of two years laid down for leave will not apply to time spent at the Staff College, which counts as duty.\n\n10. Officers recalled from leave granted under the new leave rules will be given free passage to India, or not, according to the Transport Regulations in force at the time.\n\n11. Advances of pay to officers proceeding on and returning from leave out of India will be granted as heretofore.\n\nADVANCES OF PAY.\n\nRules regarding advances of pay to Officers under the Furlough Rules of 1868 and 1875, and the Leave Rules for the Indian Staff Corps, published in Army Circulars, India, 16 April 1886:\n\nOfficers proceeding on furlough to Europe may, if they desire it, receive an advance equivalent to three months' furlough pay.\n\nOfficers returning from furlough or from temporary half pay will similarly be granted advances of pay at the following rates, on obtaining permission to return:\n\nFor a Subaltern ... ... \u00a365\nFor a Captain ... ... \u00a3100\nFor a Field Officer ... ... \u00a3150\n\nNo advance, however, will be issued to an officer who obtains from the Fund to which he is a subscriber a loan equal to or greater than the advance authorized for his rank, and an officer who obtains from his Fund a loan less in amount than such advance will be granted only the difference between the two.\n\nRecovery of the advances made in England to be effected in India by five equal monthly instalments at the rate of exchange fixed for the year in which the advance was made.\n\nThe following advances on return to duty will be issued to Warrant Officers, on the same conditions:\n\nTo First Class Warrant Officers ... \u00a350\nTo other Warrant Officers with honorary commissions ... \u00a325\nTo Second Class Warrant Officers ... \u00a325\n\n* Army Regulations, India, Vol. I., Part I., Article 1613, Clause (c).\n## ENGLISH FURLOUGH PAY.\n\n### INDIAN

The only \"next higher\" rates which give any pecuniary advantage are those of \u00a3456 per annum after 24 years' service for pension, and \u00a3550 after 27, 28, or 29 years' service for pension.\n\nVETERINARY DEPARTMENT.\n\n10.

Under the Furlough Regulations of 1796 all periods of leave within Indian limits reckon as service, all absence beyond Indian limits being deducted.\n\n19. Under the Furlough Regulations of 1854, or those of 1868, the following periods of furlough and leave reckon as service:\n\n**Combatant Officers.**\n\n| 2 years in 20 years' service. |\n|-------------------------------|\n| 3 \" 24 \"                     |\n| 4 \" 29 \"                     |\n| 5 \" 32 \"                     |\n| 6 \" 38 \"                     |\n\n**Medical Officers and Veterinary Surgeons.**\n\n| 2 years in 17 years' service. |\n|-------------------------------|\n| 3 \" 20 \"                     |\n| 4 \" 25 \"                     |\n| 5 \" 30 \"                     |\n\n20. Under the Furlough Regulations of 1875, all leave within Indian limits, and all furlough earned by length of service (i.e., one year for every five years' service in India,) reckon as service.\n\n21. Under certain conditions, leave rendered necessary by wounds or by illness solely contracted on field service is allowed to reckon as service.\n\n22. No deduction on account of leave of absence is made from the periods of service for the additional pensions specified in paragraph 1.\n\nCOMMUTATION OF PENSION.\n\n23.

An Officer in India desirous of commuting must address the authorities of his Presidency. He will be required to go through similar forms, Boards, which will, when practicable, be presided over by the chief Civil Medical Administrative Officer of the Government, being formed in the Presidency towns of Calcutta, Madras, and Bombay, under orders of the respective Governments.\n\n7. The basis of commutation, subject to an addition of years of age in the case of impaired lives, shall be the following table, the age of the Officer being reckoned at the age he will attain on the birthday next succeeding the date upon which the capitalised sum will become payable:\u2014\n\n| Age next Birthday | Number of Years' Purchase | Present Value of the Annuity of \u00a3100. |\n|-------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| 21                | 15-09258                 | \u00a31,500 5 2                         |\n| 22                | 14-96111                 | 1,496 2 3                          |\n| 23                | 14-92519                 | 1,492 10 5                         |\n| 24                | 14-88969                 | 1,488 19 5                         |\n| 25                | 14-85191                 | 1,485 3 10                         |\n| 26                | 14-80890                 | 1,480 17 10                        |\n| 27                | 14-74746                 | 1,474 14 11                        |\n| 28                | 14-67951                 | 1,467 19 0                         |\n| 29                | 14-60551                 | 1,460 11 0                         |\n| 30                | 14-52581                 | 1,452 11 8                         |\n| 31                | 14-44054                 | 1,444 1 1                          |\n| 32                | 14-35005                 | 1,435 0 1                          |\n| 33                | 14-25257                 | 1,425 5 2                          |\n| 34                | 14-14731                 | 1,414 14 8                         |\n| 35                | 14-03442                 | 1,403 8 10                         |\n| 36                | 13-91478                 | 1,391 9 7                          |\n| 37                | 13-79016                 | 1,379 0 4                          |\n| 38                | 13-66060                 | 1,366 1 2                          |\n| 39                | 13-52738                 | 1,352 14 9                         |\n| 40                | 13-38854                 | 1,338 17 1                         |\n| 41                | 13-24313                 | 1,324 6 3                          |\n| 42                | 13-08568                 | 1,308 11 4                         |\n| 43                | 12-92050                 | 1,292 1 0                          |\n| 44                | 12-74483                 | 1,274 9 8                          |\n| 45                | 12-55834                 | 1,255 16 8                         |\n| 46                | 12-36096                 | 1,236 1 1                          |\n| 47                | 12-14698                 | 1,214 13 10                        |\n| 48                | 11-92339                 | 1,192 6 9                          |\n| 49                | 11-69128                 | 1,169 2 7                          |\n| 50                | 11-45362                 | 1,145 7 3                          |\n8. The commutation having been sanctioned, the applicant will be informed, and will have the option of withdrawing his application within 30 days after receiving that notice.\n\n9. If the applicant shall not withdraw his application within that period, the decision will be considered final, and the commutation of pension will take place absolutely.\n\n10. In every case the capitalized sum will be payable in India, the sterling amount being converted at the official rate of exchange for the year in which the payment is made.\n\n11. In the case of an officer in Europe, the capitalized sum will be payable at the expiration of two months, and in the case of an officer in India, at the expiration of one month from the date of the commutation being sanctioned. In each case the officer's pension will be issued in full up to the date of payment, unless any delay has been caused by the officer's own fault or that of his agents.\n\n12. In any case in which a pensioner shall accept public employment, involving the withholding of pension, a deduction will be made from the salary payable to him equal to the amount which would have been abated from the pension if it had not been commuted, and in the event of his becoming entitled to a pension in respect of such employment, the amount of such pension granted to him shall not exceed the amount which he might have received had his pension not been so commuted.\n\nCONDITIONS OF TRANSFER TO TEMPORARY HALF-PAY.\n\nCOMMISSIONED OFFICERS.\n\n(Sanctioned by Despatch to Government of India, No. 432, dated 22nd December, 1881.)\n\nOfficers placed on temporary half-pay, at the recommendation of the Medical Board of the India Office, shall be examined by the same Board as to their fitness to return to duty every two years, and if still reported unfit at the third examination, that is, after being six years on the temporary half-pay list, they shall be transferred to the retired list on permanent half-pay. An Officer reported to be unfit at the commencement of the second period, i.e., after two years on half-pay, may, however, be permitted voluntarily to retire on permanent half-pay.\n\nOfficers unable to appear before the Medical Board at the stated times will be required to furnish a certificate, signed by two medical men, as to their inability. An Officer who is continuously unable to appear will be retired permanently after six years without further report.\n\nOfficers who, in view to being restored to the active list, may wish to appear before the Board at other times than those specified, may be permitted to do so. Officers ordered periodically to appear before the Board will receive their travelling expenses and lodging allowance on the Home scale, but those appearing at other times, at their own wish, must do so at their own expense.\n\nWARRANT OFFICERS.\n\n(Sanctioned by Despatch to Government of India, No. 25, dated 24th January 1884.)\n\nA Warrant Officer transferred to temporary half-pay may be permitted to remain on half-pay till his total continuous absence from duty, on furlough and half-pay together, amounts to four years. If then still unfit to return to duty, he must be pensioned on the rate of pension for which he had qualified at the time of being placed on half-pay.\n\nNo period spent on half-pay will count as service for Indian pension, nor will a Warrant Officer be eligible for promotion while he is on half-pay. A Warrant Officer replaced on the effective list, on return to duty from half-pay, will be re-employed at once, being borne as a supernumerary in his grade until absorbed by the next vacancy.\n\nWarrant Officers will be required to appear before a Medical Board at the expiration of one year on half-pay, and again, if retained on the half-pay list, at the end of the second year; and those who, in view to being restored to the effective list, may wish to appear before the Board at other times than those specified, may be permitted to do so. Warrant Officers ordered periodically to appear before the Board will be allowed, in this country, their bona fide travelling expenses, and lodging allowance at the rates stated below, but those appearing at other times, and at their own wish, must do so at their own expense.\n\nRates of Lodging Allowance.\n\n| Deputy Commissary | Senior Apothecary after 3 years' service in the 1st grade | Assistant Commissary | Deputy Assistant Commissary | Senior Apothecary under 3 years' service in the 1st grade | Conductor | Sub-Conductor | Medical Warrant Officers below the rank of Senior Apothecary |\n|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|-----------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n|                   |                                                          |                     |                             |                                                          |           |              |                                                          |\n|                   |                                                          |                     |                             |                                                          |           |              |                                                          |\n|                   |                                                          |                     |                             |                                                          |           |              |                                                          |\n\nISSUE OF FURLOUGH AND RETIRED PAY.\n\nMilitary Furlough and Retired Pay is made up at the India Office to the 31st January, 30th April, 31st July and 31st October, and is payable on the 1st of the following month.\nEXTRACT FROM REGULATIONS OF THE MILITARY FUND LATELY CALLED LORD CLIVE'S.\n\nWIDOWS' PENSIONS.\n\n1. Officers' widows will be required to sign a declaration to the effect that their husbands did not die possessed of real and personal property to the following amounts, and that they themselves do not, with what their husbands left and from all other sources, possess, if the widow of a colonel, \u00a34,000; a lieut.-colonel, \u00a33,000; a major, \u00a32,500; a captain, \u00a32,000; a lieutenant \u00a31,000.\n\n2. The rates of pension are as follows:\n\n| Ranks                                                                 | Per dim. | Per annum. |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|------------|\n| Colonel, Surgeon-General, and Deputy Surgeon-General                  |          |            |\n| Lieut.-Colonel, Brigade-Surgeon, and Surgeon-Major after 20 years' service |          |            |\n| Major, Surgeon-Major, and Chaplain of 15 years' service               |          |            |\n| Captain, Surgeon, Chaplain of 7 years' service, and Veterinary Surgeon of 20 years' service |          |            |\n| Chaplain under 7 years' service                                      |          |            |\n| Lieutenant and Veterinary Surgeon                                     |          |            |\n\n3. The pensions continue only during widowhood.\n\n4. Pensions lapsing on re-marriage are not restored on a second widowhood.\n\n5. Pensioners neglecting to claim the pension for three half-years will be considered as dead, and no arrears for a longer period than two years back from the date of application for admission or re-admission, as the case may be, will be allowed either to claimants or to pensioners after admission.\n\n6. The widows of officers formerly of the Indian service, who have joined the British army, retain their claims to pension from this Fund.\n\n7. The widows of officers who have retired from the service are not eligible to the benefits of this Fund.*\n\n8. The widows of officers who at the time of their death were pensioners on Lord Clive's Fund are entitled to the benefits of the Fund, provided they were married to their husbands prior to the latter having become pensioners on such Fund.\n\n9. These pensions are payable quarterly, on the 1st January, 1st April, 1st July, and 1st October.\n\nINDIA OFFICE, March 1883.\n\nNote.\u2014Applications for admission to this Fund should be addressed to\n\nThe Military Secretary, India Office, London, S.W.\n\nINDIAN MARINE.\n\nAll first appointments of Officers and Engineers in the Indian Marine are made by the Secretary of State for India in Council.\n\nThe limits of age for appointment to the junior executive rank, that of Third Grade Officer, are 17 and 22 years, and no candidate will be appointed who does not possess a Board of Trade certificate as Second Mate.\n\nApplications for appointment can be recorded at the India Office, but will not be submitted for the orders of the Secretary of State until the applicant is duly qualified.\n\nWhen he is qualified, the Board of Trade Certificate, together with certificates of birth and character, should be transmitted to the Military Secretary, India Office.\n\nCandidates must pass an examination by the India Office Medical Board prior to appointment.\n\nOn appointment a first class passage to Bombay will be provided, and an advance of \u00a325 will be made in aid of outfit.\n\nPay commences from date of embarkation for India. Service for pension reckons from date of arrival in India.\n\nThe names of candidates will be removed from the list on their attaining the age of 22 years.\n\nAny further information relative to the appointment of executive Officers may be obtained on application to the Military Secretary, India Office.\n\nInformation in regard to the appointment of Assistant Engineer may be obtained from the Director General of Stores, India Office.\n\nINDIA OFFICE\n\nJune, 1886.\n\n* Except in the case of the widows of General Officers compulsorily retired under the provisions of the Royal Warrants of 31st December 1877, 1st May 1878, 25th June 1881, 11th March 1882, and 10th June 1884.\nFurlough.\n\nI.\u2014Officers after five years' service in India or under the Government of India may receive one year's furlough, and an additional year for each subsequent five years' service. Furlough not taken at the time it becomes due is not lost, and can, subject to these regulations, be taken later.\n\nII.\u2014An officer may not be absent from duty on any grounds for more than three years consecutively, nor on return from furlough may he receive, except under Rule VII., any further furlough until after an interval of three years.\n\nIII.\u2014Furlough may be spent anywhere, and, when it has been earned by length of service, counts as service for pension. Furlough taken before it is earned by length of service reckons against service for pension till paid off.\n\nIV.\u2014An officer on furlough receives half the pay of his rank, or, if holding a shore appointment, half the pay of his appointment, excluding command, charge, acting, personal, or house allowance computed according to a rate of exchange to be fixed in each year by the Secretary of State. An officer promoted while on furlough will be entitled to a moiety of the increased pay due to that promotion.\n\nV.\u2014An officer proceeding on or returning from furlough may be granted an advance of three months' furlough pay; and he may further be granted the advance in aid of passage money specified in clause IX., if he does not obtain passage by troopship. Advances made in England will be recovered in India by monthly instalments of one-fourth of the pay drawn by the officers. Advances made in India will be noted on the last pay certificates of officers, and no issue of furlough pay will be made till after the sum advanced has accrued as furlough pay.\n\nVI.\u2014Furlough pay may not be drawn for more than two years consecutively.\n\nVII.\u2014Upon certificate of a medical board, an officer not entitled to furlough, who has served not less than one year in India, may be granted furlough. Such furlough will not count as service for pension until it has been paid off by subsequent service under the terms of Rule I. Furlough cannot be anticipated beyond two years in the aggregate, nor for a second term, unless that previously anticipated has been subsequently paid off under the terms of Rule I.\n\nVIII.\u2014An officer who has exhausted the furlough obtainable under these rules, and who may be certified by a medical board to be still unfit for duty, will be retired on the pension or gratuity to which he may be entitled; if not entitled to either pension or gratuity, his case will be specially considered.\n\nIX.\u2014Marine officers not holding shore appointments of Rs. 1,000 per mensem will be eligible for the grant of non-regulation passages in troopships when such passages are available. Officers who do not obtain passage in troopships will be allowed advances in aid of passage-money, in addition to the advances admissible under Clause V., provided that no officer shall in any case draw advances exceeding three months' pay in all.\n\nX.\u2014Furlough, whether on private affairs or on medical certificate, is restricted to a maximum period of one year in the first instance, and to subsequent extensions not exceeding six months at a time.\n\nGeneral Leave.\n\nXI.\u2014General leave may be granted for any period not exceeding six months at a time, but cannot be renewed, except for very urgent reasons, till after two years have elapsed from its expiration. It may be spent anywhere, does not involve forfeiture of appointment and counts as service for pension. It will be granted or refused entirely at the discretion of the Director of the Indian Marine. It may be granted up to a maximum limit of 30 days as subsidiary to furlough, whether on proceeding on furlough or on return from furlough. Leave granted as subsidiary to furlough can only be spent in India.\n\nXII.\u2014During general leave an officer will be restricted to the pay of his grade,* and will forfeit all allowances, which will be paid to his locum tenens. If an officer exceeds the six months' leave admissible at one time under this rule, the entire period will be converted into furlough, and his allowances adjusted accordingly.\n\nPrivilege Leave.\n\nXIII.\u2014Subject to the exigencies of the service, Marine officers may be allowed 60 days' privilege leave during each year, and such leave may be taken in instalments.\n\nXIV.\u2014An officer who has privilege leave to his credit when proceeding on leave or furlough does not forfeit it, but privilege leave cannot be taken in continuation of furlough, nor can furlough be obtained in continuation of privilege leave. Privilege leave may, however, be converted into general leave with the sanction of the Director of the Indian Marine, or into furlough with the sanction of the Government of India.\n\nXV.\u2014Privilege leave will be granted by the Director of the Indian Marine, but it will be granted only on the understanding that no additional expense is thereby caused to the State either directly or indirectly, that the applicant's services can be spared, and that satisfactory arrangements for the performance of his duties during his absence can be made.\n\nXVI.\u2014Officers are at liberty to proceed wherever they may desire when on privilege leave, provided they can ensure their return before the expiration of the leave. If an officer exceeds his privilege leave, the whole period of his absence will be converted into general leave or furlough, and his allowances and statement of service for furlough adjusted accordingly.\n\n* This rule will also hold good in the case of an officer holding a shore appointment, in which case the balance will be considered a staff allowance payable to the locum tenens, provided the latter does not thereby draw more than the pay of the appointment.\n\n\u2020 As modified by Marine Circular No. 6 of 1885.\n\n\u00a7 As modified by Marine Circular No. 7 of 1886.\n\nAs modified by Marine Circular No. 31 of 1885.\nTemporary Leave.\n\nXVII.\u2014Temporary leave not exceeding 10 days, and not in anticipation or in extension of any other kind of leave or furlough, may be granted by the Director and Deputy Director of the Indian Marine.\n\nXVIII.\u2014Temporary leave not exceeding 72 hours may be granted by commanders of vessels and heads of departments to officers under their command.\n\nGeneral Regulations.\n\nXIX.\u2014It must be distinctly understood that furlough or leave cannot be claimed as a right. Both are subject to the exigencies of the public service, and will be granted only when an officer's services can be spared. Commanders of vessels and heads of departments will not forward an application for furlough or leave unless they are able to satisfy the Director of the Indian Marine that the officer's services can be spared without any inconvenience to the public service.\n\nXX.\u2014No grant of leave given under the conditions of these rules will count against an officer's service for pension, and leave may be spent anywhere, i.e., within possible limits of return before it expires.\n\nXXI.\u2014Leave is reckoned from the day on which an officer avails himself of it, and it expires on the day he rejoins.\n\nFurlough reckons from date of leaving India or from date of leaving his ship if at an outstation, unless specially stated by authority to commence on an earlier date; and in the event of an officer returning to India before the expiration of his furlough, it ceases on the date of his return.\n\nThe day of return, whether from leave or from furlough, is a day of duty.\n\nXXII.\u2014Officers on furlough will draw their pay from the India Office, but officers on general or privilege leave must arrange to draw their pay in India.\n\nXXIII.\u2014As a rule, leave will be granted only during the period of the south-west monsoon.\n\nXXIV.\u2014Officers proceeding on furlough will report their departure personally at the office of the Director or Deputy Director of the Indian Marine, except when they avail themselves of it at an outstation. An officer returning from furlough or leave will rejoin the ship to which he belongs; but if this is impracticable, and he has not received instructions (which he should apply for beforehand), he will rejoin at Bombay or Calcutta, reporting himself in person to the Director or Deputy Director. On the departure of an officer on furlough or leave, or on the return of an officer therefrom, the commander of the vessel will cause an entry to be made of the date in the ship's log book, and will forward an extract thereof by the next post to the Director.\n\nXXV.\u2014Officers arriving in Europe on furlough must report their arrival in writing to the Military Secretary at the India Office, and state their address; and for extension of furlough or for permission to return to duty, they must also apply to the Military Secretary.\n\nOfficers proceeding to the Colonies on furlough should apply to India for extensions of furlough and for permission to return to duty.\n\nXXVI.\u2014During the absence of an officer on leave or furlough, he must keep the Director of the Indian Marine acquainted with his actual address, and be prepared to return immediately to India, should his services be required.

The following is the scale of pensions and compassionate allowances admissible to Officers and Engineers of Her Majesty's Indian Marine and to their families.\n\n2. The service for pension of an officer of the Marine reckons from date of joining his ship or appointment if he is 19 years of age or over; otherwise from date of attaining that age.\n\n3. An officer admitted to the service after 25 years of age will be subject to reduction of pension in the manner and under the rules laid down in the Civil Pension Code.\n\n4. Retirement at the age of 55 years will be compulsory, and all Officers and Engineers of that age now in the service, as well as those who may attain that age within one year, will be required to retire at the expiration of one year from the date of this order. Should an officer holding the appointment of Director or Deputy-Director of the Indian Marine attain that age during his incumbency, he may, with the approval of the Government of India, complete five years in the appointment.\n\n[This rule will not be applicable to those officers who have already received a special extension of tenure.]\n5.

Service in the survey, or in port or dockyard appointments, gives no claim to any higher pension than that fixed for an officer's rank in the Marine. Officers not on the Marine list now serving in such appointments will remain under their present rules.\n\n8. The pensions of warrant officers, gunners, and clerks will be calculated under the rules for the Uncoventional Service, as laid down in the Civil Pension Code, Rs. 60 per mensem (compensation in lieu of board and lodging) being added to their pay for the calculation of pension.\n\n9. Pensions will be payable in rupees in India. If paid in England, they will be converted at the rate of exchange fixed yearly for the adjustment of financial transactions between the Imperial and Indian Governments.\n\n10. An officer may be allowed to commute a portion, not exceeding one-third, of his pension, the commuted value being payable in India under the rules in clause 23, India Army Circulars of 1884.\n\n11. Compassionate allowances on the following scale will be granted to the families of officers who may be drowned or meet with a violent death in the execution of duty:\n\n| Widow                                      | Child                                      |\n|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| Commander                                  | \u00a320 a year, or Rs. 20 a month.             |\n| Port Officer                                | \u00a320 a year, or Rs. 20 a month.             |\n| Chief Engineer                             | \u00a315 a year, or Rs. 15 a month.             |\n| First Grade Officer                        | \u00a315 a year, or Rs. 15 a month.             |\n| Engineer                                   | \u00a310 a year, or Rs. 10 a month.             |\n| Second Grade Officer                       | \u00a310 a year, or Rs. 10 a month.             |\n| Third Grade Officer                        | \u00a310 a year, or Rs. 10 a month.             |\n| Assistant Engineer                         | \u00a310 a year, or Rs. 10 a month.             |\n\nThe cases of the families of the Director or Deputy Director will be specially considered.\n\n\u2020 See page Ixxix.\n12. The regulations and conditions under which all such compassionate allowances are to be awarded will be analogous to those prescribed for the military service.\n\nOfficers are required to signify their intention to accept the above pension rules by the 31st December, 1885, otherwise it will be understood that they have decided to remain under the rules now applicable to them.\n\n---\n\n**INDIAN MILITARY SERVICE FAMILY PENSION REGULATIONS.**\n\n(Instituted 1st Jan. 1873.)\n\n**REGULATIONS FOR THE PROVISION OF PENSIONS FOR THE WIDOWS AND ORPHANS OF MILITARY, MEDICAL, AND ECCLESIASTICAL OFFICERS IN THE SERVICE OF THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA.**\n\n1. Pensions will be provided under these regulations for the widows and orphans of the following officers on the Indian establishment, not being entitled to the benefits of any of the late Military and Medical Funds:\n\n- Officers of the Staff Corps.\n- Officers of the Indian Medical Department.\n- Chaplains.\n\n3. Every European officer who enters the service on and after the 1st January 1873, must, as a condition of his appointment, provide pensions for his family under these regulations. A Native Commissioned Medical Officer will be required to declare his intention of joining the Fund or not within three months from the date of his taking up his appointment in India.\n\nNote.\u2014On appointment to the Service, Medical Officers and Chaplains are admitted to the Fund \"from date of arrival in India.\"\n\n5. For the purposes of these regulations officers are classed as follows:\n\n- **Class I.** Lieutenant-Colonels in receipt of Colonel's allowances, and Surgeons-General.\n- **II.** Lieutenant-Colonels, Archdeacons, Deputy Surgeons-General, Brigade Surgeons, and Surgeons-Major of 20 years' service.\n- **III.** Majors, Senior Chaplains, and Surgeons-Major.\n- **IV.** Captains, Junior Chaplains, and Surgeons who have served the Government of India for more than six years.\n- **V.** Lieutenants and Surgeons who have served the Government of India for less than six years.\n\n6. The pensions provided under these regulations are payable monthly in India, and quarterly in arrear in England, and to date of death.\n\n7. The amounts of the pensions provided are as follows, in addition to any pensions or compassionate allowances granted under Royal Warrant.\n\n(N.B.\u2014The one now in force is dated 10th June 1884.)\n\n---\n\n**Table I. \u2014 Pension to a Widow during Widowhood, according to the Class of her Husband at the time of his death.**\n\n| Class of Husband at Death | I. | II. | III. | IV. | V. |\n|---------------------------|----|-----|------|-----|----|\n| Amount of pension to widow per ann.: | \u00a3   | \u00a3   | \u00a3    | \u00a3   | \u00a3   |\n| In Europe                 | 160 | 130 | 100  | 70  | 40  |\n| Rs.                      | Rs. | Rs. | Rs.  | Rs. | Rs. |\n| In India                 | 1,669 | 1,356 | 1,043 | 730 | 417 |\n\n---\n\n**Table II. \u2014 Pensions to the Orphan Children of all Classes alike.**\n\n| From birth till age of 6 years. | From age of 6 till age of 12 years. | From age of 12 till age of 21 years. | To females only from age of 21 years for life, or till marriage. |\n|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Amount of pension to each orphan: | \u00a3   | \u00a3   | \u00a3    | \u00a3   |\n| In Europe                       | 10  | 20  | 30   | 45  |\n| Rs.                            | Rs. | Rs. | Rs.  | Rs. |\n| In India                        | 104 | 208 | 313  | 469 |\n\n8. The pension of a minor orphan will be paid to his or her mother, or other duly appointed or recognized guardian.\n\nNote.\u2014Annuitants in India must draw their pensions in Indian currency.\n\n---\n\n**Contributions.**\n\n9. The contributions for pensions under these regulations, and the pensions of widows, will be regulated by the class of the contributing officer. An officer cannot secure a higher pension for his widow by contributing as if he belonged to a higher class.\nAs an exception to this rule, an officer who has completed five years' service as a substantive Lieutenant-Colonel has the option of subscribing in Class I. (A. C. 34, of Jan. 1881.)\n\n10. Contributions will be deducted by paymasters or other disbursing officers from the pay abstracts of officers contributing.\n\n10a. The circumstance that an Officer is not in receipt of pay does not relieve him from the necessity of paying his contributions.\n\n11. Donations may be paid in one sum, or in 12 equal monthly instalments. If a donation be paid in instalments, interest on the unpaid portion will be levied at the rate of 4\u00bd per cent. per annum. The balance of any contribution due at an officer's death will be recovered rateably, without interest, from the pension of his widow and orphans, in 12 monthly instalments in India, or four quarterly instalments in England.\n\n11a. Contributions which become due from subscribers when in Europe must be paid in England in sterling. If a subscriber, previous to quitting India, has commenced the payment of any donation by instalments, he may either complete the payment of the donation in India before leaving, or pay the remaining instalments in England at English rates; but an Officer on half-pay who continues to subscribe at Indian rates has the option of paying in India.\n\n12. The following are the rates of donations and monthly contributions prescribed for the present:\n\n### Table III.\u2014Donations.\n\n| Class of Contributors | On entering the Service of the Government of India married, or on marriage, or re-marriage. | On promotion to a higher class. |\n|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n|                       | In India. | In Europe. | Rs. | \u00a3   | Rs. | \u00a3   |\n| Class I               | 4320     | 384       | 810 | 72  |\n| \" II                  | 2160     | 192       | 405 | 36  |\n| \" III                 | 1080     | 96        | 270 | 24  |\n| \" IV                  | 540      | 48        | 135 | 12  |\n| \" V                   | 270      | 24        | \u2014   | \u2014   |\n\n**Disparity of Age.**\n\nIf the age of the husband exceed that of the wife by 12 years or more, then the marriage donation shall be regulated by a disparity table (Table IV.), which can be obtained from the Director of Funds, India Office.\n\n### Table V.\u2014Donation, payable by all Classes alike, on the Birth of a Child and, on entering the Service of the Government of India, for each Child then living.\n\n| For a son | In India. | In Europe. |\n|-----------|-----------|------------|\n|           | Rs.       | \u00a3          |\n|           | 168       | 15         |\n| For a daughter | 270       | 24         |\n\nBetween the ages of\n\n| Extra donation | All Officers who, on admission as subscribers, bring on liabilities for daughters above 1 year, are required to pay the extra donation specified in the margin for daughters according to their age at the date of their admission to the Fund. |\n|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1 and 2        | 50 Rs.                                                                                                                            |\n| 2 \" 3          | 75 \"                                                                                                                             |\n| 3 \" 4          | 92 \"                                                                                                                             |\n| 4 \" 5          | 104 \"                                                                                                                            |\n| 5 \" 6          | 112 \"                                                                                                                            |\n| 6 \" 7          | 115 \"                                                                                                                            |\n| 7 \" 8          | 117 \"                                                                                                                            |\n| 8 \" 9          | 119 \"                                                                                                                            |\n| 9 \" 10         | 119 \"                                                                                                                            |\n| 10 \" 11        | 120 \"                                                                                                                            |\n| 11 \" 12        | 120 \"                                                                                                                            |\n\n[G.

An officer in the service must report his marriage, or the birth of a child born in wedlock, or the death of a wife or child, within one month of the occurrence, to the Examiner of Fund Accounts in the Presidency, or the Director of Funds, India Office, when an officer is in Europe. Forms for this purpose are given in the Appendix.\n\n15. The birth of every child born alive must be reported; but if a child die before it is thirty days old, no payment in respect of it will be required.\n\n15a. If the report of a marriage, or of the birth of a child, be not made within one month of the occurrence, the donation payable in each case will be increased 2\u00bd per cent., and interest thereon charged from the date of marriage or birth of the child. After six months' delay, donations will be increased 5 per cent., and interest charged in the usual manner. (G.O.G.G. No. 381 of 1877.)\n\n15b. In the event of the report of a marriage or the birth of a child not being made by a subscriber during his lifetime, in accordance with the rules, the widow or child will not be entitled to any benefits. (Army Circulars, India, 1880, Clause II.)\n\nPosthumous Child.\n\n16. A pension will be granted to a posthumous child on payment of the donation prescribed in Table V., which may be recovered by 12 monthly instalments in India, or four quarterly instalments in England. The report of the birth of a posthumous child must be made in Form D., the last sentence being omitted.\n\nCommutation of Contributions.\n\n17. An officer who desires to complete his payments during the term of his service in India, so as to be exempt from contributions after his retirement, will be permitted to do so at rates to be determined by the tables appended to General Hannington's report, dated London, 7th June, 1870, or by any other tables that may be hereafter substituted by the Secretary of State for India in Council.\n\n18. An officer may at any time commute his future payments into a single payment, the amount of such payment being regulated by the same tables.\n\nDuration of Pensions.\n\n19. If a widow remarry, her pension will cease during coverture, but if she again become a widow she will be entitled to revert to her pension as widow of her first husband, or, if her last husband have been a contributor, to receive a pension at her option as the widow of her last husband. A widow can only receive one pension.\n\n20. The pension of a male orphan is payable until he attains the age of 21 years.\n\n21. The mother or guardian of a male orphan who has completed the age of 16 may, at any time thereafter (on application in Forms F. to H. annexed to these regulations), have the residue of his pension commuted into a single payment, for the due application of which the mother or guardian will be held responsible. The following table gives the commuted values of such pensions:\n\n| Years | 16 | 17 | 18 | 19 | 20 |\n|-------|----|----|----|----|----|\n| Months | \u00a3  | \u00a3  | \u00a3  | \u00a3  | \u00a3  |\n| 0     | 129| 106| 81 | 56 | 28 |\n| 3     | 123| 100| 75 | 49 | 21 |\n| 6     | 117| 94 | 68 | 42 | 14 |\n| 9     | 111| 87 | 62 | 35 | 7  |\n\n22. The pension of a female orphan continues until her marriage, and then ceases absolutely. It does not revive on widowhood.\n\nGood Conduct.\n\n23. The pensions provided under these regulations shall, in all cases, be held during good behaviour only, and will be withheld if any pensioner is found to be leading an immoral life, or on proof of any gross misconduct. The order of the Secretary of State for India in Council in any such case shall be final and conclusive.\n\nAlienation of Pension.\n\n24. A pension paid under these regulations may not be transferred or assigned, or in any way alienated, from the pensioner to whom or for whose benefit it is payable.\nPassage Money.\n\n25. An officer may, by a special contribution, provide passage money from India for his widow and orphans. The amount so secured will belong to the officer's estate, but will be primarily applicable to the provision of passage money and outfit for his widow and children. The amount secured must not exceed 1,500 rupees, and a health certificate must in every case be furnished by the subscriber. The value will be determined by the Tables in Major-General Hannington's report.\n\n25a. The special contribution can be paid by monthly instalments not exceeding 24, the instalments in arrear bearing interest at 4\u00bd per cent. per annum, and in the event of a subscriber dying before completion of the payment, the balance due at his death will be deducted from the sum insured.\n\n25b. Native commissioned medical officers are required to pay, as in the case of their ordinary contributions, 5 per cent. over and above the ordinary rates of special contribution (Army Circulars India, 1884, Clause 33).\n\n25c. In the event of a subscriber's family not having occasion to make use of the passage money for which special contribution has been made, it will be paid to his estate on his death, irrespective of whether this occurs before or after his retirement, or whether he continued to subscribe to the pension branch up to the date of his death.\n\nIf an officer on retirement desires to sever his connection with the Insurance Branch, he will be allowed the option of receiving the value of the sum assured at the date of withdrawal; in which case the value of the sum assured will be determined by the tables in the Regulations according to the member's age; e.g., a member withdrawing at the age of thirty, who has paid the special contribution to secure a sum of Rs. 1,500, will be entitled to receive on withdrawal:\u2014Rs. \\(1,500 \\times 391574 \\times 1.022 =\\) Rs. 600.\n\nIf, however, the option is declined at the date of withdrawal from the pension branch, the sum originally assured will be paid in accordance with the rules at the decease of the subscriber. (A.C.I. 1886. Cl. 85.)\n\nTransfer to Her Majesty's Line Regiments, and Officers who resign.\n\n26. Officers who may be transferred from the Indian Staff Corps to Her Majesty's Line regiments, and officers who resign the Service, will be entitled to receive back such portion of their contributions as may be in excess of the risk borne during their membership, but they cannot continue subscribers.\n\nHalf-Pay.\n\n27. Married officers placed on half-pay may receive back such portion of their contributions as is in excess of the risk borne during the term of their membership, or they may continue to subscribe at Indian rates (which can be paid in India) for full benefits, or at lower rates for reduced benefits. In the event of their return to full pay, they shall, in addition to the subscription of their rank, be required to pay such donation as the circumstances of the case may demand. Unmarried officers may continue to subscribe at the Europe rate of subscription, and will not be entitled to any refund in the event of their withdrawal.\n\nRetired Officers.\n\n28. Married officers who retire from the service on a pension may continue to subscribe at the Europe rate of subscription, or they may withdraw, receiving back such portion of their contributions as is in excess of the risk borne during the term of their membership; but the usual subscription will be deducted from the pension of all such officers until they shall have intimated in writing their intention of withdrawing. Unmarried officers may continue their subscription on the same terms as married officers, but will not be entitled on retirement to any refund in the event of their withdrawal.\n\nDismissed Officers.\n\n29. An officer who is dismissed the service by sentence of a court martial, or by other competent authority, will cease, ipso facto, to be a contributor under these regulations, and will have no claim to any refund. His family will not be entitled to any pensions under these regulations.\n\nCertificates.\n\n30. Declarations as to continued widowhood and the survival of children must be furnished to the Accountant-General, India Office, by whom pensions in Europe are paid under the authority of the Director of Funds.\n\nNote A.\u2014The contributions and donations to be paid by Native Members of the Covenanted Medical Service are fixed for the present at an increase of 5 per cent. on the rates paid by Europeans.\n\nAPPENDIX.\n\nNote.\u2014In England all reports and applications for pensions must be made to the Director of Funds, India Office, London, S.W.\n\nFor the present, the rate of interest is fixed at 4\u00bd per cent. per annum, and the rate of exchange with England at 1s. 6d. the rupee.\n\nForm (B.) of a Letter from an Officer reporting his having joined the service of the Government of India married.
