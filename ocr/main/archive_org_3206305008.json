Madame\u2014has a mission: it is to bring lone hearts together by means of advertisements. She would turn the columns of a newspaper into a pigeon-house for pairing. Madame\u2014(with doubtless all her heart and all her soul)\u2014averts it is\u2014\n\nLamentable to think of the thousands of men who, although desirous of marrying, and in every way qualified for the fulfillment of its duties, are yet debarred from enjoying its felicities. And on the other hand it is equally deplorable to consider the far greater number of ladies of the highest respectability who are doomed to a life of loneliness and maidenism. It is not my object to state in these few pages the various obstacles which prevent persons meeting with partners suited to their respective tastes. All will easily find a reason referring to themselves. My object is to direct attention to two ways by which all may be married regardless of age, appearance, or position!\n\nWhat think you of that? The old, the ugly, the crook-backed, the goggle-eyed, the halt and the poverty-stricken; all may be paired regardless of age, appearance, or position! And how? By advertisement. Madame's experience declares the newspaper to be\u2014\n\nThe safest, most speedy, and infallible way of effecting a marriage under any circumstances, whether male or female, those who adopt my suggestions will find hundreds of the highest respectability in every way suited to their tastes, and whom they could love with all the fondness of human affection, ready and really anxious to respond to the invitation.\n\nWell, Madame\u2014here proposes to step in, pen-in-hand, ready to draw up an advertisement (the usual fee being paid,) for any brainless gander, or foolish little goose, willing to be plucked, that gander or goose may be trussed for the altar! Madame has, however, another way; even more touching, more delicate:\n\nThere is also another way by which the above object can be realised\u2014for from my being daily in communication with hundreds of the highest respectability of both sexes, of all ages, classes, and conditions (having at the present moment the names of thirty-five titled persons on my list), who are anxious to form matrimonial alliances, it necessarily follows that I can generally introduce any person to a partner in every way suited to their fancy, possessing all the qualities essential to happiness, and render the married state, what indeed it ought to be, an earthly paradise of bliss.\n\nQuite true: Madame\u2014warrants her Garden of Eden to be wholly free from thorns or serpents. Besides: bachelor or maid may as easily be paired as commonest cup-and-saucer, for the lady \"can always introduce the exact style of person that is required.\"\n\nThe style of person we would introduce to Madame\u2014would be a police-officer; and her paradise, Tothill-fields prison, with oakum for roses. On the wrapper of her book, Madame\u2014 informs bare-faced bachelors that \"for twenty-five postage stamps\" she will send any gentleman so much hair and whisker-seed. Thus, she has not only wives, but moustachios continually on hand; and by the aid of her \"so potent art\" can transform the most smock-faced youth into the most hairy Samson.\n\nWe have cried \"beware of man and woman-traps,\" and have therefore done our duty.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3206305008.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 924, "total-output-tokens": 816, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 3574, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
