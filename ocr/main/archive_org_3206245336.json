Mr. G. F. Cummings, of Fir lodge, Penge, said that on Wednesday morning he was walking through the garden in the front of the house about 10 o'clock, when he discovered a large brown paper parcel lying amongst some growing shrubs. The garden was enclosed with close wooden rails, and the spot where the body was found was about six yards from the public road. Witness sent for the police, and when the parcel was opened it was seen to contain the body of a child, and it was taken to the Penge police-station. Serjeant Bissett, of the Penge police, said the detectives were now engaged making inquiry into the matter, but up to the present they had failed to trace the person to whom the child belonged. Upon opening the paper of the parcel the body was found deposited in a calico bag. The coroner did not take any medical evidence, and the jury returned an open verdict, leaving the police to follow up the mystery.\n\nAN UNEXPECTED SUICIDE.\n\nYesterday afternoon Dr. Diplock, the coroner for West Middlesex, held a long inquiry at 33, High-street, Notting-hill, relative to the death of Mary Ward, aged 49, the wife of a tradesman carrying on the business of a plumber at the above address. Robert Ward, the husband, stated that deceased for some time past had been in a very debilitated and nervous condition. On Wednesday evening he and his wife went out to visit a neighbour; but while on the journey she expressed her intention of going home first, and returning. She did not return, and witness afterwards went home, when he found his wife in an insensible condition in an upstairs room. An empty laudanum bottle, labelled \"poison,\" was on a table beside her. Medical aid was at once resorted to, but deceased died on Thursday. Mr. W. A. Frost, surgeon, of 47, Ladbroke-square, Kensington, said death was due to narcotic poisoning. He found a cicatrice on deceased's throat, which indicated a previous attempt at suicide. Mr. H. Sugar, chemist, High-street, Notting-hill, said the deceased purchased the laudanum from him, stating that she wanted it to cure her son's toothache. The jury returned a verdict \"That deceased died from laudanum taken by herself whilst of unsound mind.\"", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3206245336.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 1062, "total-output-tokens": 607, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 2453, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
