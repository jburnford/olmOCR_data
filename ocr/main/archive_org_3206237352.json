He stated that he lived at 58, Newington-buts, and that the prisoner entered his service on the 4th April, as a general servant. On Good Friday he and his wife left the house about three in the afternoon, leaving their three children, the eldest of whom was six years old, in the charge of the prisoner. Returning shortly before 12, they found the prisoner asleep in a chair in the parlour, and upon going upstairs they found the youngest child dead in bed. A doctor came shortly afterwards, and said the child had been dead two hours. Witness asked the prisoner when she had last seen her alive, and she said she put her to bed at half-past 10.\n\nRosina Beer, the wife of the last witness, gave evidence of a similar character.\n\nDr. Lees, who made the post-mortem examination of the body of the child, said there were two marks on the lip corresponding with the shape and size of two teeth. The appearance indicated death from suffocation.\n\nFurther evidence of a medical character was given; and in the result the jury returned a verdict of \"Not guilty.\"\n\nThe prisoner was then indicted for having attempted to strangle a boy named Charles Parfitt.\n\nThe jury found the prisoner \"Guilty\" of the attempted strangulation.\n\nSentence was deferred till next session.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3206237352.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 1108, "total-output-tokens": 500, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 2176, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
