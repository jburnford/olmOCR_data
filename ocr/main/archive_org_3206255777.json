PAUL'S.\n\nAt the Mansion-house on Monday, Herbert Percy Freund, a young man, who has during the last two years been repeatedly before the court on a similar charge, was brought up for brawling in St. Paul's Cathedral during Divine service on Sunday evening and disturbing the congregation. When the prisoner was placed in the dock, Mr. Green, the Dean's verger, entered the witness box to give evidence. On seeing him the prisoner became frantic with passion, and declared before he began that everything he would say would be false. He then, with great vehemence, said that the Lord had said that He would redeem Jerusalem, and that all the ends of the world should see His salvation. Therefore he had been sent to speak in His name to this degraded city.\n\nHenry Carbery, an assistant verger at St. Paul's, said that on Sunday he saw prisoner rise in the dome area during the sermon. He called the preacher a liar, and said he was the son of the devil. He went up and asked the prisoner to leave, and he bit him in the hand. His teeth-marks were still visible on his hand. He caught the prisoner by the wrist, and he then kicked him. A constable came to his assistance, and took prisoner away.\n\nThe prisoner, who at this stage commenced a long prayer, was remanded.\n\nOn Friday the prisoner was again brought up, when Dr. Alfred Withers Green said he had examined him, and certified him to be of unsound mind.\u2014The Prisoner: It is false. How could he certify? I did not answer him a single word, and therefore how can he say I am of unsound mind? He has nothing to go upon at all.\u2014The Lord Mayor: I quite agree with the medical officer. I shall order you to be sent away where you will be taken care of, and I hope you will soon regain your health.\u2014Prisoner: It is a false lie; it is wickedness. I have never been out of my mind. You do not wish to hear God's Word, and therefore you say I am out of my mind. They have said that about people before who have preached God's Word. I have never done anything that was wrong, and I call upon God to help me.\u2014A person who said he had known the prisoner for some years entered the witness-box, and wished to speak on behalf of Freund, but the Lord Mayor refused to listen to him.\u2014The prisoner clutched the bars of the dock, and resisted the efforts of a warder and a policeman to take him to the cells. He struggled violently, but was ultimately overpowered and taken below, protesting loudly against his being certified as of unsound mind.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3206255777.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 1108, "total-output-tokens": 596, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 2498, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
