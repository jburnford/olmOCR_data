The head, arms, and legs had been cut off and taken away, and the trunk, which was found, had been partly opened. From the condition of the trunk it was evident that a criminal assault had been committed prior to the murder. The discovery was soon noised abroad, and created considerable consternation in the town. Inquiries made by the police authorities elicited the fact that on Tuesday Emily Holland, daughter of John Holland, mechanic, of 110, North-street, aged seven years, left home at a quarter-past four o'clock in the afternoon, and had not since returned. Soon after leaving home she was sent, according to a story of her playmates, by a man to purchase some tobacco for him at a shop in the neighbourhood of her parent's house. It is described as being forty pounds aged, 5 ft. 6 in., of medium height, of fair appearance, with dark hair, slight whiskers if any, and dressed in a dark mixture cloth coat, dark vest and trousers, and clogs. From some hair found about the trunk, it is believed to be the body of the girl Holland, who is supposed to have been decapitated, ravished, and then beheaded by an unknown man. On Wednesday afternoon the police found the legs of the murdered child in a drain at a place called Cunliffe, in the township of Rishton, about a mile and a half from the scene of the tragedy. A tributary of the Blake-water runs close by where the body was found, and it is supposed that the villain, after doing his \"butchering\" work with a hatchet, washed the body in the stream.\n\nOn Friday Mr. Coroner Hargrave opened an inquest at Blackburn town hall on the body of the child, and which is supposed to be that of Emily Holland, aged seven years, the daughter of John Holland, mechanic, of 110, North-street.\n\nMary Emily Holland, aged 12, the child's age, deposed to going, to kindly Holland shortly after four o'clock, in Birley-street, near her residence, and she said she was going for half an ounce of tobacco for a man in the street\u2014a man wearing a mixture coat, black dirty trousers, and with clogs out open and down at the heel.\n\nEliza Holland said she had seen the trunk of the body at the town hall, and she was certain it was that of her child. She could tell, because she was small made, with little bones. They could almost count the ribs on her skin. She had never seen her daughter since she left home at one on Tuesday.\n\nDr. Maitland said he had examined the trunk of the body of a female child, about seven or eight years old, also the legs, one of which had short legs, corresponded with the trunk. The body was smeared with blood and covered with hair. He was satisfied that the child had been abused before the murder. The legs and arms had been cut off, and the thin bones broken and smashed. A good-sized sharp knife had no doubt been used. It was quite impossible that the child could have got the legs off, and afterwards severed them. There were two distinct cuts on the windpipe, one going right through. It was desirable to make a post-mortem examination.\n\nRichard Fairclough deposed to finding the legs of the child at Rishton. They were wrapped in two copies of the Preston Herald.\n\nPolice Constable Rostrom gave evidence as to taking possession of the trunk of the body. It was folded in two copies of the Preston Herald, dated March the 11th, 1876, and March 15th, 1876. In the parcels were some dark huts, which had evidently been cut or torn from somebody. A few white ones were amongst them.\n\nA Juror remarked that the newspapers being in contact with the trunk pointed to the fact that the murderer was not a tramp.\u2014Chief-constable Potts said they had evidence that the man in whose company she was seen was a tramp.\u2014A Juror expressed his belief that the papers had been bought at some shop on the way to Brookhouse.\n\nThe father of Emily Holland was next called, and stated that the clothes of the remains were those of his daughter Emily. The hair found in the papers corresponded with that of his daughter, dark brown.\n\nThe inquiry was then adjourned.\n\nThree tramps were arrested on Friday, but as they were able satisfactorily to account for themselves they were discharged.\n\nNeither the name nor clothing of the child had been found up to yesterday.\n\nDr. Maitland on Friday made a post-mortem examination of the deceased, and in her stomach found potato peelings, ham, and seeds of figs, food which Emily Holland had for dinner on Monday. The doctor states that as the food would have digested in four hours the child must have been murdered before Saturday night.
