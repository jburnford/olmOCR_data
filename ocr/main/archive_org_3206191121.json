It is well known that an old and obsolete law was revived on yesterday week, by Mr. Baron Pratt, that of empanelling what is termed a jury of matrons to ascertain if the convict was quick with child or not; that twenty-four females were obtained from the courts and alleys in the immediate vicinity of the Old Bailey is a matter of record; and that they were paid either 2s. 6d. or 5s. each for their attendance, is certain; but the result of their inquiry has been anything but that upon which reliance should be placed, several having subsequently stated their opinion to be that the convict is pregnant, but they cannot tell whether quick with child or not. Considering the importance of the question, the jury was not at all such a one as should have been empanelled, many being quite young women, and all (judging from manners and appearance) picked from nearly the lowest and most ignorant grade of society. The prisoner's statement, coupled with the opinions of the medical men, raises a strong suspicion that the conclusion come to by the jury is far from a correct one; and that the most important question at issue is whether the medical men of the present day are capable of forming an opinion equal to the females who were called in. It has, however, been stated, that one of the first acts of the new sheriffs, as well as that of the under-sheriffs, will be to cause such an inquiry to be instituted as to remove the slightest doubt that may at present exist on the point; and should the result be in favour of the medical gentlemen who gave their evidence on the trial, every exertion will be made on behalf of the prisoner.\n\nJOHN HUTCHINGS.\u2014This wretched man, who was convicted at the last sittings of the Central Criminal Court, of the murder of his wife by poison, has been removed to the County Gaol, at Maidstone, where the extreme sentence of the law will be carried into effect, should he not be reprieved, it being the prison of the county in which the offence was committed. It is probable that the execution will take place about Thursday week. There seems, however, to be a strong feeling that there will be a reconsideration of the evidence; and that a respite will be granted.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3206191121.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 1476, "total-output-tokens": 578, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 2497, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
