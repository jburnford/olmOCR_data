Mr. Gill, on behalf of the prisoner, pointed out that she belonged to a most respectable family, and up to the present charges she had borne an excellent character. At the time that she committed the offences, and for some time previously, she had been suffering from a very severe attack of hysteria, and was attended by two medical men. This appeared to have been the cause of her conduct. Of course, the Post-office authorities had been put to very great annoyance and inconvenience, but as regarded the forgery no actual pecuniary loss had been sustained. As to the charges and imputations made by the prisoner in the letters and postcards which formed the subject of one of the indictments, there was not the slightest grounds for them. The father of the prisoner, her nurse, medical adviser, and the vicar of Upper Tooting, the locality in which she resided, were called to speak as to the state of the health of the prisoner during the period over which the offences complained of extended. The Recorder, in passing sentence, told the prisoner that he respited sentence in order that the fullest inquiry might be made into her state of health. He had heard the evidence adduced, but at the same time it was impossible to deal with cases of this kind unless he treated them as most serious. By a remarkable facility, which she undoubtedly possessed, of imitating handwriting, she had jeopardised the liberty and character of a young lady\u2014the complainant\u2014against whom no charge could have been made; and so successfully had she imitated her handwriting that she had deceived a most experienced expert, and the young lady was within an ace of being convicted on a groundless charge. She had also been convicted of forgery. In addition to this the jury had found her guilty of sending libellous postcards and letters through the post; and notwithstanding the kindness of the late Mr. Raikes, when Postmaster-General, who having had the matter drawn to his attention, promised not to take steps against her if she would desist in her conduct, she still persisted in sending the objectionable missives, having given her assurance not to do so. He ordered her to be imprisoned and kept at hard labour for fifteen months. As she left the dock the prisoner exclaimed in an impudent tone, \"You will all live to regret it.\"", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3200810926.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 1062, "total-output-tokens": 553, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 2508, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
