A gentleman complained to him that Rayne had put her arms round his neck, and that he could not get rid of her. As Rayne would not go away he took her into custody, when she behaved in a very excited manner, and threw herself down, and whilst he was trying to get her up several persons, amongst others some of the female prisoners, struck him with their umbrellas. Caffie kicked, and Matthews struck him with her umbrella.\u2014Detective William Robertson, who appeared to have received very severe injuries, one eye being totally closed, stated that on going to Cadman\u2019s assistance Hastings kicked him, and Denton struck him several times about the eyes, saying when he told him he was an officer, that he did not care.\u2014Detective-serjeant Pickles said he heard someone say \u201cHere\u2019s Pickles,\u201d and Denton turned round and struck him in the eye. (The witness had a bad black eye.) He saw Caffie take hold of Robertson by the hair and hold him while Hastings kicked him twice.\u2014Replying to the prisoner, Pickles said he did not say, \u201cCan\u2019t you \u2018sneak\u2019 any watches to-night? Don\u2019t they hang low enough?\u201d\u2014Mr. Mansfield said he considered it a very disgraceful riot. It was the duty of everybody to assist the police, and they might be indicted if they did not do so. Rayne would be fined 40s., Matthews discharged, and the other prisoners would be committed for two months each with hard labour.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3206247301.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 1016, "total-output-tokens": 476, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 1927, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
