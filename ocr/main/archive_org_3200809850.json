At this stage a large crowd outside gathered, and great anxiety was shown to gain admission to the court. The prisoner was accompanied by the police officer from Holloway. Miss Edward was also present. In answer to the examination of the bloodstains in the kitchen, the witness said she was four or five minutes behind Miss Edwards when she entered the house, and conversed with Miss Edwards about what appeared to be food and the management of the fires, as well as whether there would be any tea desired, and similar matters. She then went back to the outer room where she met Mr. Hogg and his wife, Mrs. Hogg, she said. Miss Edwards had already accompanied Mrs. Hogg into another part of the house, and Mrs. Hogg asked her for something, but did not say anything about the charge. As there must be some compensation for the police officer's personal services, Mr. Peppin could hardly decline the payment for them, although he could not have done so even in ordinary circumstances. Miss Edwards then visited her family at Blackheath, and Mr. Hogg came out of his bed, telling her that it looked as if it had snowed very heavy last night. He then joined her in Blackheath.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3200809850.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 510, "total-output-tokens": 347, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 1462, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
