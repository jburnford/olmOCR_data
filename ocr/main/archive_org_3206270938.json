White, indicted for the murder of John Dawson by fatally stabbing him, was found \"Guilty\" of manslaughter and sentenced to 10 years' penal servitude; James Glen, charged with the murder of his wife, was found to be insane and ordered to be detained during her Majesty's pleasure; and Jessie McCallum, tried for the murder of her infant child, was convicted of manslaughter, and sentenced to penal servitude for six years.\n\nA SHOCKING CONDITION OF THINGS.\n\nMr. Baxter held an inquest at the Poplar town-hall on Friday respecting the death of Edward McCarthy, aged five months, the son of a labourer, residing at 37, Woolmore-street, Poplar. Margaret McCarthy, the mother, made a rambling statement, and kept moaning and groaning, but all that could be gathered from her evidence was that she went to bed about two a.m. on Christmas day, and when she awoke about seven she found the child dead. Catherine Shean, sister of the last witness, stated she visited Mrs. McCarthy on Christmas eve, and stayed till two in the morning. She noticed that the child appeared ill, and in company with the mother they took it to Dr. Harvey's, but could make no one hear. They had nothing to drink, and when she left they were all sober. The Coroner: Is the mother sober now? Witness: Yes. The Coroner (with surprise): Oh. I only wanted to know what your idea of sobriety was. Dr. Thomas Harvey stated that the cause of death was suffocation by overlaying. There had been someone in his surgery the whole day, so that anyone who had gone there would have been attended to. The jury returned a verdict of \"Accidental death,\" the foreman suggesting that the mother should be censured, but the coroner said that it would be useless doing so, as she would forget all about it when she was sober.\n\nMANBY'S PETROLITE SOAP POWDER saves hours of needless rubbing and scrubbing, and is most comforting to the hands.
