From the evidence adduced it appeared, that at about six o'clock on the morning named, a laboring man saw a bundle lying in the middle of the road. After kicking it over he noticed the head of a child, and then called the police, who, on examining it, found it to be the remains of a full-grown infant. Mr. Evans, the parish surgeon, gave it as his opinion that the child had been born several months, and from the examination he had made believed it to have lived. It was in an advanced state of decomposition, and an open verdict of Found Dead was recorded.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3202405178.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 1292, "total-output-tokens": 246, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 937, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
