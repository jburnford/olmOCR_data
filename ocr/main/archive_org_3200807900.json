James Beneys\u2014it being an action for slander\u2014came on for assessment of damages, Before Mr. Under-Sheriff Burchell and a jury. Mr. Harper, barrister, appeared for the plaintiff, who resides at 6, Waterloo-place, Bromell's-buildings, Clapham; and the defendant, who appeared in person, is a painter, residing in the same neighbourhood. Mr. Harper, in opening the case, declared that the language complained of was of the very worst character. What the defendant said to the plaintiff was, \"You are a thief, and you have robbed me of \u00a33.\" That was a specific charge, in specific language, but the defendant had not appeared to support it, and judgment had been given against him by default. But this accusation was not all the defendant said of the plaintiff. He also said, \"You keep nothing but a house of ill-fame,\" and he even accused her of encouraging his daughters at her house. It was true that the defendant's daughters did visit the plaintiff's house, but the explanation of that was that, when the mother of the girls died, she commended them on her death-bed to the care of her friend, the plaintiff. Mary Bennett, the plaintiff, was called, and stated that she had known the defendant as a neighbour for twelve years, and had been a friend of his wife and children. On May 17th last she met the defendant, and asked to speak to him, but before she could open her mouth he made use of the language complained of. Up to that time she never had any quarrel with him. As a result of his charges she had suffered very much in the eyes of her neighbours. She had been hooted at and pointed at as the woman who took the man's daughters away. The defendant went into the box and repeated his assertions, but called no witnesses. He asserted that he had been cruelly treated, and accused plaintiff of making certain assertions with respect to his relations with his late wife. At last the Under-Sheriff interfered in a particularly vehement speech, with the remark, \"Really, gentlemen, the court is being turned into a chamber of horrors.\" The jury eventually found a verdict for \u00a33. Defendant: I have no money. The Under-Sheriff: I can't help that. The law must take its course.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3200807900.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 1108, "total-output-tokens": 560, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 2359, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
