The former river bounds it on the south, separating Ballia from the parganas of Buxar and Arrah in the Shahabad district of Bengal; while the latter flows along the northern and eastern borders, the country beyond it including the Salmipur pargana of Gorakhpur and Sewan and Chapra of the Bengal district of Saran. On the west the boundary is for the most part artificial, the most important exception being the Barju river for several miles of its course. To the north Ballia marches with the Muhammadabad and Sagri tahsils of Azamgarh; and to the south with the Muhammadabad tahsil of the Ghazipur district. The geographical limits are the parallels of $25^\\circ 33'$ and $26^\\circ 11'$ north latitude and $83^\\circ 38'$ and $84^\\circ 39'$ east longitude. The extreme length of the district from east to west is about 63 miles, and the greatest breadth from north to south some 42 miles. The district does not extend to the actual confluence of the two great rivers, but stops at the boundary of Shitah Diara, a mahal of Shahabad in Bengal. The total area is a variable quantity, to a greater extent indeed than in any other district of the United Provinces. This is due to the erratic action of the Ganges and Ghagra, which are apt to vary their channels from year to year in a most remarkable fashion. The net result is, however, fairly constant, if the average of a series of years be taken; for loss in one place is generally compensated by gain in another direction. In 1896 the whole area was 793,623 acres or 1,240 square miles. According to the returns of the last survey the total was 792,151 acres, but by 1901 this had risen to 800,124 acres, since which time there has been a slight decline, the average for the five years prior to 1906 being 797,708 acres. Earlier figures are not\navailable, owing to the frequent interchange of territory with the neighbouring districts. The variations are confined to a few parganas only, and are most noticeable in Daula, Ballia, and Kharid.\n\nIn its general aspect the district is a level plain without any hills or natural eminence, the only variations being caused by the high banks of the great rivers and the gentle slope from the central watershed towards the Ganges, Ghagra, and Sarju. Here and there are to be found depressions of varying depth and extent, in which the surface drainage of the interior collects, prior to its dispatch by small streams and channels into the main systems of the rivers. The only two natural divisions are those of the interior uplands, which consist of comparatively old formations of alluvial deposit, and the riverain alluvium, which is constantly liable to change, the greater part of it being inundated during the rains, when the great rivers are apt to change their course and produce the most remarkable alterations in the boundary and physical conformation of this portion of the district.\n\nIn point of area the two divisions are approximately equal. The uplands have an average height of some 210 feet above the sea level, and comprise the western half of the district, embracing the whole of the Bhadaon, Lakhnoor and Kopuchit parganas, most of Sikandarpur, the interior portion of Garha, and a narrow strip of land extending eastwards into Kharid and Ballia. Here the boundary is marked roughly on the south by the line of railway as far as Sahatwar, from a short distance beyond which the gradually shelving promontory of old alluvium terminates, bending backwards in a direction generally parallel to that of the Ghagra, close to the town of Bansdih, from which place it curves westwards and then north to Maniar. The latter town stands on the bank of the Ghagra, which is here fixed by a large reef of kankar. There is a second ridge of the same nature twelve miles further up at Qutliganj, but between these two spots the bed widens out into an extensive alluvial tract, the edge of the uplands receding several miles to the south. Beyond Qutliganj there is another stretch of low alluvial land, continuing as far as Bithra, where the high bank once again touches the river. On the south-west the uplands terminate in the valley of\nthe Sarju, which has a deep channel of no great width. In the interior the level is only broken by scattered depressions and the ill-defined lines of drainage, of which further mention will be made later. The soil is for the most part a light loam with a considerable admixture of sand, very similar to that prevailing in the north of Azamgarh, where it is known as balaundar. On the higher ridges the proportion of sand increases, and the land becomes very light, though not unfertile. In the depressions the soil stiffens into clay, and in these tracts, which are often very extensive, rice is the prevailing crop. The western portion of the uplands is further characterized by wide stretches of water, which is very common in Kopachit, Lakhnesar, Bhalan and part of Sikandrapur. The water area makes its presence known by the appearance of the saline efflorescence known as roh, which is an almost invariable result of saturation and the absence of any well marked channel for the escape of the surface drainage. It is impossible to show the actual proportions in which the area is divided between the different soils, owing to the absence of any statistics, but on the whole it may be said that loam accounts for some 80 per cent. of the area, the rest being divided between the light sandy soils and the various denominations of clay, distinguished by the people as matkar and karni.\n\nThe lowland tract comprises the rest of the district, but is far from being of a uniform character throughout. The main distinction is between the more recent and the more ancient alluvium, the former being that lying on the immediate banks of the rivers, known generically by the name of daira, which corresponds to the khadir and kachhar of other parts; while the latter includes those lands which have remained untouched for a long period and are marked by inexhaustible fertility, by close and continuous cultivation, by numerous groves, and by densely clustered villages. A further distinction should be made between the recently formed lowlands of the Ganges and those of the Ghagria. The two rivers differ very greatly in the nature of their action, with the result that the new formations exhibit widely different characteristics. In the extreme east of the district the two blend into one another without any line of demarcation. There is similarly in most cases no clear boundary between the ancient and\nrecent deposits, save where the Ganges has cut into the older formations within the last few years, leaving a cliff of sand with a top layer of earth varying in depth from little more than a foot to several yards, or in the few places where the flood bank of the Ghagra is clearly marked. The surface of the lowlands is often very uneven, being scored in every direction by irregular depressions marking the old courses of the rivers, some of these almost resembling tributary streams and others surviving as narrow lagoons, while others again are merely traceable in the long ridges of unfertile sand. As a rule the level is about 15 feet below that of the uplands, though it varies from place to place; the only recorded heights are those of the Great Trigonometrical Survey pillars at Binchhapra to the north-east of Ballia, Khadipur to the north of Bansdil, and Nurpur near Reoti, which are at the base 204, 205, and 190 feet respectively above the Karachi sea level.\n\nThe Ghagra is a great river, navigable throughout its length in this district, and indeed for a long distance above the Ballia borders, by boats of large tonnage and stern-wheel steamers of considerable carrying capacity, even when it has shrunk to its smallest dimensions during the dry season. The river has its origin in the mountains of Kumaun and Nepal, and is formed of the combined waters of the Chauka, Kauriha, Rapti and many smaller streams. It swells during the rains to an immense size, and as the current is then very strong and rapid, the damage done by flooding is frequently severe. The stream is apt to fill the entire space between the flood banks and its subsidence is accompanied by the formation of numerous side channels and backwaters in the low alluvial lands, while the whole surface of the country thus inundated is changed to a surprising extent from year to year. The course of the river is stereotyped by kankar reefs at a few places only, such as Turtipar, Qutbganj, and Ailasgarh near Maniar. Between these points the variations in the channel are continuous and remarkable, but the greatest changes are those which occur east of Maniar. In this part of the district the whole country south of the river is low alluvium, and consequently an exceptionally heavy flood will submerge an enormous area, extending as the line of inlets and creeks which marks the\nflood limit and including all the land north of the town of the Banadah and Rooti. While, however, the changes effected by the Ghagra are more sudden and sweeping than those of the Ganges, the extent of damage done by this river is generally less; for having a shorter course to run from the hills and a stronger current, it is more apt to adopt for itself a straighter line than the southern river. At the same time the Ghagra is much more unstable, both in its action and effects. It is generally possible to predict the course of the Ganges to some extent, but the Ghagra defies prophecy, throwing up islands and destroying them, at one time confining itself to a comparatively narrow bed, at others tearing through the land in several channels, sometimes leaving behind it a deposit of fair fertility, and sometimes, perhaps more often, nothing but barren sandy waste which never improves beyond acquiring a capacity for producing tamarisk or the reedy thatching grass known as dhonr. The fact that a good field of one year may become absolutely sterile the next, if it has not been altered out of recognition, is the most annoying feature of the Ghagra's actions; in the diaries of this river there is no regular progression from sandy waste to fertile plain, and the instability of the river in area increases more and more as its confluence with the Ganges is approached. A Ghagra flood almost inevitably causes temporary deterioration, and the cultivator whose kharif crops are washed away has not even the satisfaction of knowing that his land is being improved; the deposit of sandy silt has none of the advantages of the rich fertilizing mud brought down by the Ganges.\n\nThe Ghagra receives very little drainage in this district, and consequently its tributaries are of an insignificant description. The first is a small stream known as the Haha or Ahar, which joins the river some three miles west of Turtigar after forming for a short distance the boundary between this district and Azamgarh. It takes its rise in the Ratoi Tal in pargana Nattipur of Azamgarh, and its effect on the drainage of Ballia is very slight. The next tributary is a nala known as the Rahera or Bajraha, which falls into the main stream near Manpur and drains part of Sikandarpur East. The Rahera is a small and unimportant stream, which flows into the great lake known as the Munthari.\nDah, and thence into the Ghagra to the east of Maniar. Its outlet changes from time to time, varying with the annual floods when much of the country east of the Dah is submerged. Another tributary is the Tengraha, though this does not in reality deserve the name, being properly a backwater of the Ghagra and presumably marking a former channel. It first leaves the Ghagra a short distance below Maniar, and thus flows through the northern pargana Kharid in a very tortuous course, eventually passing into Doaba and rejoining the main river in the village of Chand Diana. It thus affects a considerable area, and as it contains a perennial flow of water, the stream occupies a somewhat prominent position in the geography of the district.\n\nThe Ganges first touches the boundary of Ballia in the extreme south of pargana Garha. It there flows between Koratadik and Buxar, each of which places stands on a high bank of permanent formation. From that spot onwards its course lies through alluvial lands, which are constantly being cut away, altered and reformed. No other fixed point indeed exists till the river reaches Dinapore, some 64 miles in a straight line from Buxar. The changes effected by the river are extraordinarily great, and a comparison of a modern map with one of fifty years ago shows the most surprising alterations in the southern boundary of the district, the old landmarks having been swept out of existence, and the natural features of the past being wholly unrecognisable. The fall of the river is slight, and the banks, which are composed of unstable sand covered with a deposit of soil varying from a few inches to a few feet in thickness, offer no effective resistance to the current. From Buxar eastwards the course of the Ganges is a succession of loops and bends, each of which remains approximately in the same position, at least for a number of years, although their limits vary to the extent of several miles. The permanent banks, which are not readily capable of erosion, lie at a distance of one another ranging from ten to twenty miles. Between these limits the course of the river is as variable as the folds of a flag fluttering in the breeze. At one place the river is cutting into the older alluvial formation, which it had not visited before within the memory of man, and is ruthlessly carrying off village sites and groves, while on the opposite bank a new diara is being\nthrown up. At one place it is encroaching on the Ballia side, and a little further down it sweeps round, cutting into Shahabad and depositing extensive areas of new alluvium on the north. The changes are especially great in pargana Doaka, almost the whole of which is submerged during the rains. In the cold season this tract presents a continuous expanse of rich cultivation, unbroken by boundaries, groves, or village sites. Save where the tract is too wide and too distant from the unsubmerged land to be cultivated thencefrom, villages do not exist; where settlements upon the ground are necessary, the cultivators live in thatched huts with walls of wattle, which can be removed in the event of an inundation; these settlements having the distinctive names of chhaprisa. This name is sometimes, however, applied to villages with houses of the ordinary type, having mud walls and tiled or thatched roofs. The silt deposited by the Ganges is of marvellous fertility and yearly produces magnificent crops of wheat, barley, peas and mustard. The soil, which is a mere layer of loam upon the underlying sand, is soft and friable, requiring little labour for its tillage, and is annually renewed by the fertilizing action of the river. At the same time the deposit varies in character, for the same spot may receive nothing but sand one year and good silt in the next; the area of which, moreover, is never constant. As a rule, however, the changes are more or less gradual. In the course of the formation of a new daira land is first deposited, either on one side or in the middle of a river; and this sandy patch changes in extent and position under the river's action for several years till at last a definite tendency is exhibited by the current to recede from the sand bank and flow only on one side of it. When the sand reaches a certain level the deposit arrested changes to fertilizing mud; for it is only the lower strata of the river's current that carry the sand, owing to the greater specific gravity which causes the sand to sink more rapidly. For a year or two the mud deposit is, perhaps, only a patch in the middle of a sandy waste, and changes in position and depth every year. But as the river continues to recede and the daira to increase in height the current of the flood flows over it with a slackened pace and with water free from sand. The new daira rapidly becomes culturable, while sometimes, but not always, a dense growth of thatching\ngrass or tamarisk bushes covers it for a year or more before it comes fit for ordinary tillage. The Gauges differs from the Ghagra in that it seldom throws up islands; the channel is nearly always single or else merely divided by sand banks. These d\u00eeras are the most fertile source of dispute, not only by reason of the alteration in the boundaries, but also because of a varying nature of the surface soil. Reference will be made later to the complicated fiscal history of these alluvial lands, but mention may be made here of a peculiar custom with regard to the division into fields. The latter are usually long and narrow strips stretching from the high bank to the edge of the water, their length increasing or decreasing according to the action of the river. Rents in these fields are payable only on the actual area under cultivation and a deduction is made on account of sand and water-logged soil. This custom is known as balpanchit, the word bal denoting sand and panchit land unculturable on account of saturation. Similarly the land known as bijmar, in which the seed has failed to germinate, is not liable to rent. The management of the Dumraon estate recently instituted a large number of suits in which an attempt was made to recover rent for the entire holding, but it has been ruled that these deductions must be allowed. In such villages the patwaris have almost absolute power, of which they rarely fail to take advantage, as the classification of the land is entirely dependent on these officials. Special rules have been drawn up for annual verification in the villages of Dumraon estate, with the object of ensuring a correct record of such areas in the patwaris' papers, as the latter provide the sole evidence in suits for arrears of rent with regard to the liability of the tenant to pay rent or otherwise: local enquiry, save as regards the area of the present year, being useless by reason of the shifting nature of the cultivation.\n\nThe Ganges at the present time flows in a north-easterly direction as far as the town of Ballia, the older portion of which has been entirely cut away. To the east of Ballia the river describes a large loop to the south, the d\u00eeras being on the northern bank, and belonging to the villages of Shaopurdar, Jaahi, Haznagar and Haldi. Beyond this the river is cutting into Ballia as far as the boundary of pargana Doalu, having\nwithin recent years washed away more than twenty villages. Further east comes a second extensive bend, and here the action is being reversed, much land having been added to this side. In all cases the erosive action of the stream is very similar. It persists for a course of years in carving away the bank in one direction, at first slowly, then with great force, and then stopping. The reverse process follows, but is not immediately apparent, for the stream recedes as slowly as it began.\n\nThe junction of the Ghagra with the Ganges is at present in the Shahabad district, but formerly this was not the case. The former river has a much higher velocity than the latter, and brings down far coarser sand; and as the combined stream flows with a slower current than the Ghagra, it is unable to carry off the heavy deposit, which thus accumulates at the junction, forcing the two rivers further apart. The traditional point of union was the Saraha Tal, and the supposition is probably true. In 1840 the confluence was 27 miles to the east of Ballia and nine miles west of Chapra. Ten years later it was six miles to the south-east of that point, and by 1875 it had shifted another five miles eastwards, being just beyond Chapra. By the end of 1895 the junction had moved on twelve miles, and was then about 14 miles to the east of Chapra; so that the easterly progression had taken place at the rate of 23 miles in 55 years.\n\nThe chief tributary of the Ganges in this district is the Sarju or Tons. The former name, which is frequently applied to the Ghagra, and especially at Ajodhya, lends some support to the theory that the larger river at one time took this course. It first touches the boundary in pargana Bhadaon, and then for several miles separates Ballia from Ghazipur. Near Pardhanpur it enters pargana Kopachit West, afterwards flowing in a south-easterly course through Kopachit East and pargana Ballia to join the Ganges near Bansthana, three miles to the west of Ballia town. The point of junction has shifted considerably within recent years, owing to the erosive action of the Ganges, for not long ago the Sarju passed to the south of Ballia and fell into the Ganges some two miles to the south-east. The Sarju is navigable during the rains, and in former days was largely used for commercial purposes, as affording the easiest means of access to\nthe important business centre of Rasra. There is a permanent bridge over the river on the railway between Pephna and Baragun, and during the dry season a pile bridge is maintained on the road from Ballia to Ghazipur at Pipra-ghat, a short distance below the railway bridge, this being replaced during the rains by a ferry.\n\nJust before its junction with the Ganges the Sarju unites with the Mangai, a river which flows through the centre of the Ghazipur district and enters pargana Garha two miles to the south of Karaon. It thence continues in a north-easterly direction past Narhi and several other large villages, carrying off the drainage of the upland portion of pargana Garha. The Budhi or Lakra nala is another tributary of the Sarju, joining that river a mile below Baragun. It takes its origin in a chain of jhils in pargana Sikandarpur west, known as the Basnahi Tal, and is ordinarily a very insignificant stream. Occasionally, however, the swamps at its source overflow in years of heavy rainfall, and then the Budhi attains a considerable size. In most seasons the stream is easily fordable, and the only bridge is that at Saunra on the road from Rasra to Ballia. Mention may also be made of the Katchar nala, which carries off the overflow from the Sumba Tal into the Ganges. It leaves the lake on the eastern side and then curves to the south-west, passing to the west of the town of Ballia, close to the new civil station, and falling into the river a mile below its present junction with the Sarju. The Katchar is dry during the hot weather, and in the winter months has but a sluggish current; during the rains it swells to a large size, either forming an escape for the waters of the lake, or else, when the Ganges is high, reversing its action and pouring the waters of the river into the Tal. The changes in the course of the Ganges are further illustrated by this stream, for at no very distant period the Katchar was a tributary of the Sarju. The Katchar nala is bridged at Dumri, Shanknapur, Zirabasti, near Patkhauli on the road from Ballia to Sikandarpur, and near Wasirapur on the road to Ghazipur; the last being an iron girder structure, while the others are of masonry. There is also a railway bridge over it at Ballia.\n\nThe lakes and jhils of the district are not only very numerous, but in many cases of considerable size. Altogether some 55,400\nacres are under water, and although this also includes the rivers, the latter constitute but a small proportion of the whole. The area is greatest in pargana Kharid, after which come the two Sikandarpurs, Ballia and Doaba. Most of the lakes are due to fluvial action in the past, and this is further illustrated by their shape, which generally resembles that of a horse-shoe, representing a bend in some former channel of the river, the two ends having become silted up subsequently to the adoption of a new course by the stream. Others are of a different nature, being due to the existence of depressions in the surface of the country, and to the absence of any natural outlet for the drainage water.\n\nThe most important lake in the district is the great Suraha Tal, an immense permanent sheet of water, which when full covers an area of about 8,500 acres and has a circuit of nearly 16 miles. The last survey was made during the cold weather, and then the area covered by water was found to be only 2,774 acres, the difference between the maximum and the minimum representing land which is ordinarily dry in the winter months and is capable of producing valuable crops. These consist for the most part in rice of a peculiar character, which grows to a great height and in favourable seasons is very productive. The necessary conditions are that the rise in the water should be gradual, for if the lake fills too rapidly the plants are drowned, and if it fails to rise, they wither. In the deeper parts of the lake large quantities of the weed called sirwar are grown. This is in great demand for clarifying sugar, and the supply is mainly responsible for the location of the numerous sugar factories round the lake, especially at Harumanganj. Suraha Tal is also a very valuable fishery, the rights being vested in the zamindars of Basantpur on the western bank. Local tradition ascribes the formation of the lake to the Chorus, but there are no traces of artificial construction, and the theory seems untenable in view of its enormous size. In all probability it marks a former point of confluence of the Ganges and Ghagra. The lake is drained or filled, as the case may be, by the Katihar, which connects it with the Ganges. It also receives a large amount of drainage from the surrounding country; the chief sources of supply being two\nsmall channels on the west, one of which follows the boundary of the Ballia and Kharid parganas, while the other, known as the Garari, flows somewhat to the north, draining a portion of Kharid and Kopahit east. It was once proposed to utilize the lake as a reservoir for irrigation purposes by constructing a dam on the Katchar, and thereby regulating the flow of water to and from the Ganges. It appeared doubtful, however, as to whether this dam would not result in silting up the mouth of the Katchar, and eventually the scheme was rejected on the ground of expense. The project has once again been revived, and is now forming the subject of a fresh enquiry.\n\nSeveral other lakes are of sufficient importance to deserve separate mention. Among the largest is the Mundiar Dab, between Maniar and Bansdih. This is obviously an old channel of the Ghagra, and is of a narrow semi-circular shape; its overflow passes into the river, and at times the lake is liable to be inundated by the flood water poured into it from the north. The Dab is owned by the Maharaja of Qasim Razar in Bengal, but formerly it belonged to the Mundiar Rajputs. The land on either side is the property of various zamindars, but they have no rights on the lake. The fishery is of some importance, and each of the many boats engaged in fishing pays an annual royalty varying from Rs. 9 to Rs. 12. Other products are rice, and the reeds from which matting is made. Of a similar nature is the Reoti Dab, which lies to the west of the town of that name, and like the Mundiar lake pours its overflow into the Ghagra along the Tengraha and other channels. A third large lake in the Ghagra lowlands is that of Sikandarpur, a short distance east from the town. In the Ballia tahsil there is the Kawal Dab to the north-east of the district headquarters, to which some reference will be made later. Tahsil Raora possesses several large lakes. Such are the Garha Tal near Ratanpura, and that of Itaura in pargana Bharan, three miles to the west. These are shallow stretches of water, connected during the rains, but drying up in the hot weather; their overflow passes into the Sarju to the south. The Basahi Tal is a long irregular depression commencing in the Azamgarh district and eventually merging into the Budhi river; it is of varying depth, and the water is\nheld up in many places by means of artificial embankments for the purposes of irrigation. Others include the Taleji Tal to the south of Rasra, the Goka Tal, a short distance north of Ratanpura, the Sakhel Tal near the Siar or Bilthra Road railway station, and the extensive lake near Haldi in the north of the tahsil, which overflows into the Ghagra and apparently represents an ancient channel of that river.\n\nThe foregoing account explains to some extent the drainage system of the district. The greater portion of Ballia lies in the watershed of the Ganges, and only a comparatively small area in that of the Ghagra. The dividing line admits of no clear definition, and the drainage outfall of the central tracts, and in particular that of the Rasra or western tahsil is often determined solely by the relative height of the two rivers. Generally speaking, the natural drainage is effective, but liable to derangement when either of the capital streams is in flood. On such occasions, which usually take place two or three times in each monsoon, the height of the river water blocks the outlets and pours inland into the various lakes and depressions. The most notable example is afforded by the Katchur nala, which ordinarily carries off the surplus water of the Suraha Tal into the Ganges, whereas in times of flood the river sends a large volume of water into the lake, more indeed, it is said, than is received from the drainage of the interior. But for this, it would be a fairly simple matter to drain the many depressions of the district, whereas the cost of works to keep back the river water renders any such scheme out of the question. As to the areas which are liable to suffer from excess of water, it may be asserted that the whole of the Ganges and Ghagra lowlands come under this category, and especially pargana Doaba, which becomes a veritable lake in times of heavy flood. In addition to these tracts, there are several places along the course of the Sarju and near the many large jhils, which are apt to be injured by inundation and the consequent waterlogging. Among such areas the more important include the lands in the vicinity of the Suraha Tal, the Garha Tal in tahsil Rasra, the Rooti Dab, the lands about Intwari in pargana Garha, and the extreme north-west of the district near Chandair and Tengonian. The town of Rasra and the villages to the north-west of the south\nare poorly drained, and in order to remedy this defect it has been proposed to construct a cutting with the object of carrying off the water from this area into the Talaji jhil and thence into the Sarja, at an estimated cost of about Rs. 6,000. In pargana Ballia there is a defectively drained area between the railway line to the east of the district headquarters and the road from Ballia to Haldi. This depression commences at the swamp known as the Kawal Dab, and thence takes an irregular course eastwards. In 1896 a scheme was prepared with the object of draining this tract, and work was actually begun, but was dropped on account of the opposition raised by the Dumraon estate. In 1893 an irrigation officer, Mr. M. Nethoraole, was deputed to report on the locality, mainly at the instance of the Hon'ble Munshi Madho Lal, the owner of taluq Ser. It was ascertained that this ill-defined drainage line represented an old bed of the Ganges, the outlet having been blocked by the more recent deposits near the river, which are usually higher than the land in the interior. The outfall in this case was originally at Paghannah, but this had long been silted up, and the surplus water escaped southwards by several creeks crossing the road. These creeks act in both directions, and the inundations caused by the Ganges when in flood result in saturation, rendering cultivation for the rabi harvest impossible, the area thus affected ranging from 300 to about 1,000 acres in taluq Ser, and to about 1,250 acres in all. It was proposed to excavate a cutting eastwards ending in a sluice gate, the total cost being estimated at Rs. 3,975; but objections were again raised by the Dumraon authorities on the score of probable waterlogging in their lands near the outlet, and eventually the matter once more fell into abeyance.\n\nThe district is very highly cultivated and development has been carried almost to the farthest limit, so that the barren area is necessarily small. The figures vary slightly from year to year, and consequently a better idea can be obtained by taking the average for a period of five years, while those of 1906, the latest year of record, will be found in the appendix.* For the five preceding years the area returned as barren waste averaged\n\n* Appendix, Table V.\n125,388 acres or 15.8 per cent. of the whole district, and in 1906\nthe corresponding figures were 126,918 acres or 15.9 per cent.,\nthe annual fluctuations varying directly with the total area of the\ndistrict. These returns require, however, some further explanation\nfor the greater part of the land coming under this head cannot\nproperly be described as barren, at any rate in the sense of waste\nland unfit for cultivation. On an average, 55,400 acres are\nunder water, and 20,400 acres are occupied by village sites, roads\nand the like; so that there remains only 44,100 acres which are\nactually uncultivable, or no more than 6% per cent. of the entire\ndistrict. This is an extremely low figure, especially if it be\nremembered that over 13,000 acres are to be found in Khairi and\nmore than 11,000 acres in Doaba, comprising the sandy wastes\nalong the Ghagra and Ganges. The Ballia pargana comes next\nwith some 7,000 acres, the bulk of the remainder being confined\nto Sikandarpur West and Bhardaon. In these parts the barren\narea consists mainly of usar, which only occurs in any quantity\nin the Rasra tahsil. About five-sixths of the total usar area is to\nbe found in the two western parganas, the amount being 2,960\nacres in Bhardaon and 2,427 acres in Sikandarpur West, while\nKopachit West has 737 acres and Lakhnoor 400 acres. This usar\nland is highly impregnated with the saline efflorescence known\nas rai, which are of considerable commercial importance in this\ndistrict, as from them large quantities of salt and saltpetre are\nobtained. Most of the usar is in the shape of small patches, and\nthe only stretch of any size is a tract in Bhardaon, about three\nmiles long and a mile wide, traversing the villages of Bahawar,\nBakuchi, Pilkhi, Darman, and Ardauman. No effort has been\nmade to bring it under cultivation, as the cost would, it is said,\nbe prohibitive.\n\nThere are no forests in the district and, strictly speaking, jungles.\nfew jungles worthy of the name. Along the great rivers there\nare numerous expanses of sandy ground covered with jau or\ntamarisk, which afford cover to wild pig and other animals, the\nchief being those near Jauhi and Sheopurdiar in pargana\nBallia, at Chand Diara in Doaba, and at Lilkar in Sikandarpur\nEast. In the interior of the district a few patches of dhak are\nto be found, varying in area from one to three hundred acres.\nThey are most common in the Rasra tahsil, where the chief are those of Meondi Kalan in pargana Bhadaon, Indaur near Chilkaheh in Kopachit West, Bhadaura Tarohhapar near Bilthra Road station in Sikandarpur West, and at Dahri and Nagpur in Lakhnesar. In the Ballia tahsil the most important area of dhak remaining is at Kopwa in pargana Kopachit East. The trees are sold periodically and cut down for fuel, being then left to grow till they have regained a marketable size. Near Rasra itself, close to the tank and shrine of Nath Baba, is a patch of tree jungle, which has the appearance of a primeval forest, and if this is so, it is the sole relic of a past woodland in existence. Altogether there are about 13,000 acres of bush or tree jungle in the district, some 5,000 acres being recorded both in the Rasra and the Bansdih tahsils, and over 3,000 acres in Ballia. This excludes grass land, of which more than 6,500 acres are shown, by far the greater portion being found in the Doaba and Ballia parganas, where there are extensive grazing-lands of considerable value for both cattle and horses. Besides the dhak, the commonest trees seen in this district are the bargud or banyan, the mango, kathal or jackfruit, mahua, pipal, nim and shisham, while several other varieties common to most parts of the provinces grow well. The tar or toddy palm is abundant, especially in the western parganas, and a large income is annually derived from the lease of the right to collect and sell the tar or fermented sap obtained by tapping.\n\nWhile jungles are rare, Ballia is, save for the rice tracts of the Rasra tahsil, one of the best wooded districts in the plains of these provinces. The number of groves, filled with mango and other trees, is exceptionally large and gives a pleasing variety to the landscape. Moreover, the area occupied by these artificial groves exhibits a constant tendency to expand, and this increase is important as a sure sign of growing prosperity. With high prices and a fixed revenue demand there is no inducement to cut down the old groves and bring the land under cultivation, as is the case in some districts, but rather it is possible for the landowners to plant fresh groves, which are not only a source of pleasure to the owners, but are valuable as affording a supplementary\nprovision of food in years of drought. Many groves too are the property of tenants, and especially of those holding at fixed rates. At the last revision of records the grove area was 23,056 acres, whereas the average of the five years ending in 1906 was 25,250 acres or nearly 3-2 per cent. of the whole. The proportion varies greatly in different parts of the district. In Bhadon, with its large sugar plains and dhak jungles, only 1-6 per cent. is under groves, and in Doaba, where the sandy nature of the soil and the constant changes in the configuration of the country render permanent groves an impossibility, the area is no more than 2-08 per cent. Low figures are also obtained in the other parganas of the Rasra tahsil, notably Sikandarpur West, and also in Garha; while on the other hand the average is slightly exceeded in Ballia and Sikandarpur East, and in Kharil the grove area is no less than 4-8 per cent. of the whole, a ratio which is seldom exceeded in any district, save perhaps the richer portions of southern Oudh.\n\nThe geology of the district exposes nothing beyond the ordinary Gangetic alluvium, and consequently the mineral products are but few. They are confined to the saline earths from which saltpetre and salt are educed, to brick earth, and to the limestone conglomerate known generically as kanker. The first is chiefly confined to the sugar lands in the Rasra tahsil, though patches are to be found elsewhere, and the process of manufacture will be dealt with in the following chapter. Brick earth is to be obtained in most places, except in the extreme east, the best quality being that of Ballia, Hammanganj, Kotwa near Komtadih, Bilthra and Turtipar. Brick making is carried on by private enterprise on Bull's patent system, the standard mould of $9 \\times 4\\frac{1}{2} \\times 2\\frac{1}{2}$ being in general use. They are made in three qualities, the price at the kiln being Rs. 8, Rs. 6, and Rs. 4 per thousand, while the cost of carriage amounts to an additional eight annas per mile. The small lakhauri bricks of the country are produced at Rasra, Bansdih, and other places, the price being Rs. 4 per thousand, or the same as the pila or third-class bricks; while the ordinary sun-dried bricks, which are turned out when required by the brickmakers of almost every village, sell at Re. 1-1-0 for the same quantity. Some\nform of kankar is to be found in all portions of the district except pargana Doaba and the lower tracts of pargana Ballia. In some places it crops out in masses on the surface, while in others it is only reached at considerable depths. In a few localities it exists as a solid and compact mass, and in this form it can resist the action of a violent current for an indefinite period; but more usually it occurs in small nodules, and then the soil is peculiarly friable. Here and there it takes the form of block kankar or chawan, and in this shape it has been used in the past for the foundations of old temples, mosques and bridges; but at the present the only place where serviceable kankar of this description is quarried is at Sibachaur on the road from Phaphna to Rasra, where it lies at an average depth of 2 feet 6 inches below the level of the ground in a seam about fifteen inches thick. The small nodular kankar is known as bichwa, and is found at the same depth in strata, averaging eighteen inches in thickness. The cost at the quarry, including the compensation paid to the landowners, is ordinarily Rs. 1-10-0 per hundred cubic feet, while the cost of carriage is twelve annas for the first, and eight annas for each additional mile. This kankar is used for road metal, for concrete, and for producing lime. Usually the lime required for large buildings is burnt on the spot, but otherwise it can be purchased without difficulty at an average price of Rs. 20 per hundred cubic feet, including carriage. The most important lime kilns are those at Barhmain near Hanumanganj.\n\nExcepting kankar, there is no stone in the district, and that required for building purposes has to be imported from Chunar in Mirzapur. Plain stone work costs from Rs. 1-12-0 to Rs. 2 per cubic foot; dressed stone work about Rs. 2-8-0; and ornamental work, as well as heavy pillars, lintels and the like, Rs. 3-8-0; while stone flagging can be done for Rs. 24 per hundred square feet. Timber for building, if of good quality, has to be imported from Calcutta, Gorakhpur, and elsewhere, teak logs costing Rs. 3, and sal logs Rs. 2 per cubic foot. Of the local woods the best is shisham, which costs as much as sal, while mango, mahua, jamun, neem and other species, which are commonly used for rafters and battens, may be obtained at the rate of twelve annas per cubic foot. A considerable amount of\nash timber and small sal beams are obtained from Bahramgat in Para Bariki, being brought down the Ghagra in boats; the former is extensively employed for rafters and the like, but is twice as expensive as mango. Country bamboos, which figure so largely in native domestic architecture, fetch from Rs. 20 to Rs. 25 per hundred. Tiles for roofing, when of the common small variety, average Rs. 2 per thousand, though the price varies with the season.\n\nThe wild animals of the district are unimportant, both as regards their actual numbers and the variety of species. There are none of the larger carnivora, and even wolves are unknown. As usual, foxes and jackals are common, while the remainder comprise chiefly pig and black-buck, the former being found in the lowlands of the Ganges and Ghagra, while the latter chiefly resort to the jungles along the banks of the Ganges, particularly in pargana Doodha. The same pargana contains large numbers of nilgai, which are also found in most parts of the district. No other species occur in any number and even hares are seldom to be found. Game birds are somewhat rare, neither variety of partridge being found in the district, while snipe do not visit Ballia in great numbers, though in some years they are common on the edges of the Saraha Tal and the other jheels. Wildfowl, on the other hand, are abundant during the cold weather, when the rivers and the larger lakes are covered with geese and ducks of many varieties.\n\nThe fisheries of the district are of considerable value, and there is a large demand for fish as an article of diet on the part of almost every class of the people. The usual varieties of fish common to the plains are found in the rivers and lakes, and a considerable section of the population derive a subsistence from fishing, although in most cases they betake themselves to it as an employment subsidiary to agriculture. At the last census 2,067 persons were returned under the heads of fishermen and fish dealers, and though this is a large figure as compared with other districts, it by no means represents the actual number of persons engaged in this occupation. Practically all the Mallahs resort to fishing during the season, as also do many Kshatriyas, Pasi, and other castes. There are no fishing rights in the Ganges.\nand Ghagra, but elsewhere they are usually the property of the zamindars, the only exception to this rule occurring in the case of the lower reaches of the Sarja, above its junction with the Ganges. Here the right to fish belongs to Government and is annually leased. Generally the landowners exact a royalty on each boat engaged in fishing on the lakes, and in the case of the Suraha Tal a large sum is thus collected annually. The implements adopted for catching fish are of the usual description, but it remains to mention a peculiar method employed on the Suraha Tal. There the commonest mode of fishing is with a net spread over a bamboo framework, made in the shape of a cone, the sides of which are covered with netting, while the bottom is left open. When this net is used, a number of boats form in a wide circle, and slowly and silently converge towards a given spot, when with one accord all the net-covered cones are plunged into the water and stuck in the soft mud of the bottom. The presence of fish within the net is made manifest by their struggles; all those worth keeping are speared and secured, and then the nets are withdrawn, and the operation is repeated in another place.\n\nThe domestic animals in this district are for the most part of the ordinary inferior description, and are mainly the offspring of the so-called Brahmani or dedicated bulls, which wander about the country without a master, and attach themselves to different herds of cattle at pleasure. These bulls are deliberately set at liberty by the Hindus, either because they bear certain marks which are regarded as inauspicious, or more commonly in conformity with the religious ceremony known as birkhotserg, practised at the funerals of the wealthy, whereby a calf is set free in order to bring a blessing on the soul of the dead. Such calves are branded on the right fore-leg and flank, so that they can easily be distinguished from private property. They are left to shift for themselves, and frequently do considerable injury to the crops; but as the damage is spread over a considerable area, and the animals serve a useful purpose, no serious objections are raised. No systematic attempts have been made as yet by Government to improve the breed of cattle in the district, although the private importation of up-country bulls has on several occasions been attended with successful results. There\nare no special breeds of cattle peculiar to the district; with the possible exception of those known as Dasela, from the village of that name in pargana Doaba. These have some local reputation, but are generally considered inferior to the animals imported from Tirhut, Janakpur, Sita Marhi and Bachhwa in Bengal. They are either purchased on the spot or sold by travelling dealers. Some years ago a meeting of the leasing zamindars and tenants was convoked to consider the question of cattle-breeding in the district, and it was then agreed that the existing system, or rather the lack of system, adequately met the local requirements. The largest sales of cattle take place at the Dadri fair near Ballia, when some 60,000 head or more change hands annually. Another cattle fair is held at Baranpur, some five miles from the district headquarters, in March or April, and this replaces the old gathering at Kishanganj, which was abandoned some 16 years ago on account of the diluvion of that village by the Ganges. There is an important cattle market at Sahatwar in the Banasthali tahsil, where bullocks are brought in large quantities and are sold to agriculturists, and of recent years the market at Keora in the same tahsil has attracted a considerable amount of trade. The average price of an ordinary plough bullock ranges from Rs. 30 to Rs. 35, while animals of a superior stamp fetch double that sum.\n\nThe first regular cattle census was taken in August 1899, and we have no previous figures collected in the same way with which to compare its results. In former years annual totals were supplied by the patwaris, but these were never checked, and their value is consequently small. On this occasion it was found that there were 136,226 bulls and bullocks and 1,237 male buffaloes, giving a total of 137,463 plough animals, with an average of 2-3 animals per plough. This figure is somewhat below the general average for the provinces at that time, but is practically the same as those obtained in the adjoining districts of Gorakhpur and Ghazipur, and distinctly higher than that of Azamgarh. A second census was taken in January 1904, when the number of bulls and bullocks was found to have dropped to 132,045, and that of male buffaloes to 905, giving an average of only 2-11 animals to each plough. On the other hand, the number of young\nstock had increased by some 4,000, the total being 140,245. The enumeration also showed 105,041 cows and 41,721 cow buffaloes, a marked increase being noticeable under each head. According to the returns the average plough duty amounted to nearly 5-2 acres, which is well above the general average; the figure is much the same in the other eastern districts, such as Rensares, Ghazipur and Gorakhpur, and betokens either a light soil or a somewhat superior breed of cattle, both factors being probably at work in the case of Ballia.\n\nThe last census returns gave a total of 3,163 ponies and horses. These animals are in most cases of a poor quality, resembling the ordinary small country-breds of the plains. In former days, when a Government stud was maintained at Koratadifh and Buxar, a good deal of horse breeding was carried on by the zamindars, who were given the privilege of using the Government stallions on condition that Government should have the refusal of the colts and fillies. Since the abolition of the stud in 1873 this branch of industry has greatly declined, and the class of animals bred in the district has much deteriorated. An attempt is now being made to raise the standard by posting a stallion at Ballia, but so great has been the degeneration in thirty years that suitable mares are now few in number. The district is, however, the scene of considerable enterprise in horse dealing. Animals purchased at the various fairs in the western districts, notably at Nauhati and Batesar, as well as those brought from Amritsar and other places in the Punjab, are brought down to Ballia and are kept at Damodarpur, Majhawn, and a few other villages in the east of the district during the hot weather and rains, and are sold at the Sonapur fair in Bihar; the residents of these villages engaged in this trade usually bringing the horses down-country in droves during March and April. At the large Dadri fair near Ballia some four or five thousand horses and ponies are annually brought for sale, but nearly all are of an inferior stamp; approximately half the number brought find purchasers among the small zamindars, tenants, and Banias.\n\nThe other domestic animals call for no special comment. In 1904 there were 87,000 goats and 32,000 sheep, the numbers being in no way remarkable. They are kept for food, for their wool\nand hair, and for penning on the land, and are considerable source of profit to the Gadariya herdsmen. There were 4,360 donkeys, but these are of the usual wretched description, and are only employed by Dhobis, Kumhars, and others as beasts of burden. Camels numbered but 15, and their use is very rare. As in Ghazipur, the climate seems to be unsuited to them, and transport is either effected by means of carts, or else by pack bullocks.\n\nCattle disease is at all times more or less prevalent in the district, but it is impossible to obtain accurate statistics. The most common form is foot-and-mouth disease, though occasionally epidemics of rinderpest and anthrax occur, in either case doing considerable damage. Since 1904 a veterinary assistant has been attached to the district, but very little has as yet been effected, either in the matter of inoculation, or in arousing the people from their general apathy towards scientific treatment and their unwillingness to receive medicines unless supplied free of cost.\n\nThe climate of Ballia is on the whole dry, and though it can scarcely be termed bracing, it is not particularly energetizing. The extremes of cold and heat experienced in the western districts of the United Provinces occur but seldom in this part of the world, nor does the humid atmosphere of Lower Bengal penetrate so far inland, except during the monsoon months. Frosts are comparatively rare, though considerable damage was done by the phenomenally low temperature in the spring of 1905. During the hot weather the prevailing wind is from the east, rendering the atmosphere close and muggy; when the west wind blows, it has little force and the use of grass huts is generally unavailing, though occasionally they are of service for a week or more at a time between the middle of April and the beginning of June. In the latter month the highest temperatures are reached, but there are no thermometric observations on record to show the maximum or the mean heat attained during the hot weather. Though the mercury seldom rises much above 100\u00b0 in the shade, it must be borne in mind that such heat is more trying than the higher temperatures reached in the drier climate of the west. December and January are the coldest months, but the cold is never severe. Bad hailstorms are of rare occurrence.\nRecords of the rainfall are available from 1864 onwards. Rain-gauges are maintained at each of the tahsil headquarters, but that at Bansdih has been in existence only since 1891. The average total rainfall of the whole district for 42 years has been 41.82 inches. The local variation is but small, the Ballia tahsil showing 42.52, Rasra 41.05 and Bansdih 42.71 inches. It is not a fact, however, that Bansdih has actually the greatest rainfall as the figures in the case of that tahsil are for the last 15 years only, and the averages for the same period were 43.42 for Ballia and 41.31 inches for Rasra, showing that the period was one of exceptional precipitation. The fluctuations from year to year are somewhat remarkable; though it must be borne in mind that more depends on the distribution of the rainfall than on the actual quantity received. So far as agriculture is concerned, if a moderate fall be obtained at the right times with the necessary intervals of sunshine, a good kharif harvest will be ensured, while late rain results in a large extension of the rabi area. Actually the greatest fall on record was that of 1871, when 73.4 inches were received at Ballia and 68.4 inches at Rasra. This resulted in extensive and serious damage from floods, as was also the case in 1890, when Rasra registered 71.1 and Ballia 64.8 inches. Over 60 inches fell in 1890, while in 1898, 1894, 1886, 1880, 1879, 1867, and the preceding year the district experienced falls exceeding 50 inches. Such excessive rainfall causes the jhils to overflow their banks and damage the adjacent lowlying tracts, but the injury thus effected is much less harmful than that resulting from the flood water of the Ganges and Ghagra. The danger of drought is less to be feared. In the famine year of 1877 no more than 19 inches fell at Ballia and only 17.3 inches in Rasra. Other years of marked deficiency were 1864 with 23.6 inches; 1868 with 26 inches; 1883 and the following year with 27 and 23.6 inches respectively; and 1896 with 26.24 inches. On the last occasion the Ballia tahsil fared the worst, obtaining only 23.67 inches in the year, Bansdih receiving more than six inches in addition. On all other occasions the district has registered over 30 inches, and this amount obviates real distress, unless synchronizing with an early cessation of the monsoon.\nBallia has somewhat undeservedly obtained the reputation of being a very malarious and unhealthy district, though this description only applies to certain seasons of the year. Though fever is undoubtedly prevalent, and though large areas lie low and are apt to be flooded and waterlogged from the annual rise of the great rivers, the country rears a strong and vigorous race of Rajputs, who cannot be the product of a really unhealthy tract. The state of affairs is fairly illustrated by the vital statistics, the records of which, from 1891 onwards, are given in the appendix.* In the case of this district, indeed, the returns are available since its formation. From 1881 to 1890 the average death-rate was 24-68 per mille, the highest figure being 28 in the last year. For the ensuing decade the average was 26-12, the rise being due to the abnormal mortality of 1894, when the rate rose to 40-24 per mille; this is attributable not only to an unprecedentedly large number of deaths from fever, but also to the worst outbreak of cholera that has been experienced since the constitution of the district. From 1901 to 1905 the average rate was slightly over 40 per mille\u2014a result which may wholly be ascribed to the fearful ravages caused by plague, this disease being accountable for more than 51,000 deaths in the space of four years. Such a visitation is, of course, accidental, and the true death-rate of the district should be estimated from the average of the period which elapsed prior to the appearance of this scourge. In this way we obtain a mean death-rate of 25-4 per mille, and this figure by no means betokens an unhealthy climate, as it compares very favourably with the rates observed in most portions of the provinces. The returns of births are not perhaps so reliable as those of deaths, but they provide a fairly accurate index of existing conditions from 1881 to 1900; the average birth-rate was 30-3 per mille, and for the next ten years 31-65, while from 1901 to 1905 the figure rose to 36-2, in spite of the high death-rate of that period. The only occasions on which the number of deaths exceeded that of births were in 1891 and 1894, both years of epidemics, and also in 1903 and the following years when plague wrought havoc among the population. The highest birth-rate in any one year was 42-17 per mille.\n\n* Appendix, Tables III and IV.\nin 1890, and the lowest 24\u00b782 in 1895, following on a year of exceptional unhealthiness.\n\nThe second of the two tables shows the mortality under the main causes of death.* Allowance must be made for a certain amount of error in this connection, as the diagnosis depends mainly on the village watchman who reports the deaths. This is especially the case with regard to fever, as the usual custom prevails of entering under that heading all deaths in which fever is an apparent factor, unless they come under some other well known category. It is undoubtedly true, however, that actual malarial fever is the commonest cause of death. According to the returns it accounted for nearly 33\u00b77 per cent. of the recorded mortality from 1881 to 1890, and for 81 per cent. during the following ten years, the proportion rising in the absence of other epidemics and falling when cholera, small-pox or plague make their appearance in a violent form. The only really remarkable year was 1894, when fever was responsible for nearly 32,000 deaths or one-third more than the average. It then assumed a regularly epidemic character, spreading with great rapidity in September and the following months, and reaching its climax in December. Similar but less acute epidemics were observed in 1897, 1899 and 1901. The only preventive measure taken is the distribution of quinine; but such is the general apathy that though this remedy is available at the cheapest possible rate, being sold in pice packets through vaccinators and at post-offices, the amount disposed of is extremely small, owing to the unwillingness on the part of the people to pay even this sum. The truth probably is that they have no real faith in its efficacy, and while they do not object to using it when supplied gratuitously, they have no desire to purchase the drug.\n\nThe same attitude is very largely responsible for the prevalence of cholera, which is never absent from the district for a whole year. Attempts are made on the outbreak of the disease to check its spread by disinfecting wells, distributing medicines, and improving the sanitary conditions of the villages; but little can be effected by reason of the neglect on the part of the ignorant and bigoted population to observe even the simple precautions prescribed\n\n* Appendix, Table IV.\nfor their benefit. From 1881 to 1890 cholera accounted for 1,562 deaths annually, or 6\u00b77 per cent. of the total mortality, considerable epidemics occurring in most years, and especially 1882, 1885, 1887 and 1890. During the ensuing decennial period there was no improvement, as the average was 1,001 deaths or 6\u00b76 per cent. The worst outbreak was that of 1894, when 5,238 persons were carried off by the disease, while in 1900 another visitation of almost equal intensity was experienced. These, however, were eclipsed in 1903, when the mortality amounted to 6,538, the highest figure on record. A large number of deaths were again attributable to this disease in 1905 and the following year, when cholera raged throughout the eastern districts.\n\nSmall-pox is another disease which is always present in some degree, though the resultant mortality is in many years very small. From 1881 to 1890 there were some 3,800 deaths from this cause, or about 1\u00b76 per cent. of the total number recorded. Nearly half of these occurred in 1884, when 1,833 persons were carried off, and other epidemics were those of the first and last years. In the following decade small-pox decreased by over fifty per cent., the total number of deaths being 1,770, or 7 per cent. of the whole. There was only one bad outbreak, in 1891, when over 1,000 deaths were recorded. In subsequent years there have been one or two epidemics of no great magnitude, the chief being that of 1903, which was generally a most unhealthy year. The lowest figure was four deaths only in 1895. It is probable that the returns do not apply exclusively to small-pox, as the term may embrace all eruptive diseases, such as chicken-pox and measles, although efforts are made by the police and other authorities to test the statements of the charlatan. There can be no doubt that small-pox has diminished to a very great extent during the past fifty years. It is known that the disease was once very prevalent in these parts, though no figures are obtainable, and its disappearance can only be attributed to vaccination. Long before Balla became a district, it was generally recognised that inoculation meant immunity, and many of the old people bear the marks to this day. The practice was displaced by vaccination soon after the mutiny, and by the time that the district came into existence it was already well protected. From 1891\nto 1900 some 18,200 persons were vaccinated annually, the figure rising from 11,500 in the first, to 26,000 in the last year. For the five years ending in 1906 the average was very much higher, amounting to 38,000 persons annually, so that in that period nearly 25 per cent. of the population was protected. In the last year the number declined; but this was due to the increased vigilance that has been maintained of late, so that few persons remained to be vaccinated besides the infants born within the year. The work is under the supervision of the civil surgeon, subordinate to whom is an assistant superintendent and fifteen vaccinators.\n\nSome mention has already been made of the recent ravages of plague in this district. When the disease first made its appearance in 1902, every possible precaution was adopted to prevent its spread; but the people with one accord resisted all such measures in the most determined manner. A member of the medical staff was mercilessly beaten, tied hand and foot, and placed on the railway line; he was rescued just in time, and some of the ringleaders were punished. But the result of this opposition was disastrous, for plague became endemic in the district and in four years the mortality was enormous, cases occurring every day but one in 1904. As a rule, the mortality increases from September onwards, reaching its maximum height in March and then abating till in June it almost ceases. The people have now learnt by bitter experience the advantage of evacuating their houses, but have yet to learn that evacuation to be effective must be complete. In the municipality of Ballia all infected houses have been treated with perchloride of mercury with the most satisfactory results, as no second case has occurred in any house thus protected. There have been no instances of prophylactic inoculation, and little has been done in the way of exterminating rats. Inoculation was commenced in 1907, and seems likely to become popular.\n\nThe other diseases are of little account, save perhaps as regards dysentery and bowel complaints, which are accountable for large numbers of deaths every year. They are frequently the result of malarial fever, as also is enlargement of the spleen, which is very common. In certain parts of the district, and\nnotably the northern portions of the Banadilh and Raara tahsils, goitre is prevalent. This affliction is much in evidence throughout the course of the Ghagra and its tributary the Rapti in these provinces, and it is possible that the common belief that the disease is associated with the waters of that stream has some foundation in fact.\n\nStatistics of infirmities have been collected at each enumeration held since the district was formed. The figures are not particularly instructive, partly owing to the difficulty of securing correct returns. In 1901 there were 90 insane persons, showing an increase of ten over the figure of 1891 and a decrease of 30 as compared with the total of the preceding census. The number is unimportant, as also is that of lepers, of whom there were 157; though this is less than one-third of the 1881 total. There were 752 blind persons, this again being a remarkable decrease: blindness is closely connected in many cases with small-pox, and the reduction in the number of persons afflicted may in some measure be attributed to the spread of vaccination. There remain the deaf-mutes, of whom 312 were enumerated. The figure is comparatively high, as is invariably the case in districts where goitre is a common disease, the connection between goitre and cretinism having long been established.\nCHAPTER II.\n\nAGRICULTURE AND COMMERCE.\n\nNo statistics of cultivation are available for the whole district before 1886, and consequently it is impossible to establish any satisfactory comparison between existing conditions and those which prevailed at an earlier date. The last revision of records was completed in 1885, having occupied a period of some four years; and even then the figures referred to only a portion of the present district, excluding the parganas of Sikandarpur, Bhalon and Garha. The last was not added to Ballia till 1892, but the records are extant separately, although they leave out of account several villages which were transferred from other districts at various times, while on the other hand these transfers were frequently counterbalanced by exchange with either Ghazipur or the adjacent territories of Bengal. The returns are, however, of some value as they are in the main accurate, and serve to show the progress achieved during this space of at least twenty years. From 1880 to 1895, the average area under the plough was 534,056 acres or roughly 67 per cent. of the whole district. For the first half of this decade the figure was remarkably constant, averaging 543,113 acres; but in the last year a decline was observed, and cultivation dropped to a marked extent, the average for the second five years being only 525,000 acres. The decrease was common to all tahsils, but was more noticeable in Rauna than elsewhere. From 1890 to 1900 the proportion remained low, averaging 521,400 acres; the climax was reached in 1897, when only 497,130 acres were under cultivation, but in the last year the recovery was complete, the area being 546,400 acres, or little lower than the previous highest record of 549,940 acres in 1888. The run of bad seasons was followed by a time of great and general prosperity, for from 1901 to 1905 the average cultivated area was 543,504 acres or 68-14 per cent. of the whole district. The highest figure ever attained\nwas 552,948 acres in 1904-05. Considerable fluctuations must of necessity occur from time to time, owing to the nature of the season, and also as the result of the physical conditions prevailing in certain tracts. Such are the lowlands of the Ghagra and Ganges, where the area sown for the spring harvest depends closely on the character of the annual floods; so that an average for a period of years is a safer guide than the figures of any single season, to a greater extent perhaps in this district than any other. The state of development also varies in the different parganas. The average proportion of cultivation is highest in Garha, where it amounts to 82.7 per cent. of the whole, and next come Kopachit East with 75, and Ballia with 74 per cent.; so that the Ballia tahsil is far more highly cultivated than either of the others. Bansdih, with 68.6 in Sikandarpur East and 67 percent. in Kharid, closely approximates to the general average; while Rasra is in every case below it. Pargana Bhadaon, which has a large area of barren land, is only cultivated to the extent of 57.8 per cent.; Lakhnesar has 64.4 per cent. under tillage, Sikandarpur West 65, and Kopachit West 65.8 per cent. There remains Doaba, in which the annual fluctuations are greater than elsewhere, the average cropped area being there 65.3 per cent. of the whole pargana. Still Doaba is the most fertile portion of the district, and the comparatively low percentage of cultivation is due to the extensive areas of sand in the riverain tracts.\n\nThe actual progress achieved has been greater than at first sight appears, for while the net cultivated area has increased almost everywhere, there has been a larger proportionate expansion of tillage owing to the greater extent to which the practice of double cropping is now followed. From 1886 to 1895 the area bearing two harvests in the year averaged 115,865 acres or 21.69 per cent. of the net cropped area; while during the next ten years the average rose to 145,012 acres or 27.3 per cent. There was a constant tendency to increase throughout this period, for during the last five years ending in 1906 the mean amount was 152,572 acres. The proportion is highest in the Ballia tahsil, pargana Doaba coming first with an average of 39 per cent. for the last five years, followed by Garha with 35, Ballia with 33, and\nKopachit East with 23 per cent. In tahsil Baradib we find 28 per cent. of the cultivation of pargana Kharid bearing a double crop, and 22 per cent. of that of Sikandarpur East. In Raora the averages are lower, Bhadaon and Sikandarpur West showing 21 per cent., Kopachit West 23, and Lakhnesar a little more than 22 per cent. Taking this increase into consideration, there has been a total gain of nearly 50,000 acres in the cropped area when the last five years are compared with the period between 1880 and 1890; and this is sufficiently remarkable in a district where cultivation has long been pushed to the furthest limit and the pressure of the population is fully as great as the soil can bear.\n\nIn the preceding chapter it was shown that the barren and unculturable area has averaged for the last five years 15-88 per cent. of the whole district, and if this be added to the cultivated area there remains 15-98 per cent. as culturable waste, the actual extent being 127,413 acres. This figure is, however, subject to extensive deductions. In the first place, it includes grove land, which should properly be described as culturable and amounts to 25,250 acres; and secondly, 6,384 acres of land come under this head as being temporarily out of cultivation, but in course of preparation for receiving a crop of sugarcane in the following harvest. Similarly, the new fallow should be excluded, as such land lies waste temporarily, under the usual system of rotation. This occupies 24,967 acres, and consequently there remains but 63,100 acres of old fallow and 17,712 acres of so-called culturable waste. The distinction between the two is very slight, as also is that between the latter category and barren land. Most of it is of a very poor quality, and it is probably true that almost all fields which are capable of profitable tillage have been already brought under the plough. Much of this area, too, is not readily available for cultivation, as it consists of dhak jungle, grass land and pasturage, or else ground shaded by scattered trees. Taking culturable waste and old fallow together, the highest proportion is 19 per cent. of the total area in pargana Bhadon, followed by 10 per cent. in Kopachit West, 14 per cent. in Sikandarpur West, and 13 per cent. in Lakhnesar; so that the Raora tahsil has far more land available than either of the others. In Bansdih the figures are 9 per cent. for Sikandarpur East and\n47 per cent. for Kharif; while in the Ballia tahsil the only pargana with any extensive area untilled is Kopachit East, where it amounts to 8-6 per cent., the remainder showing proportions of 53, 42 and 13 per cent. in the Doaba, Ballia and Garha parganas, respectively.\n\nThe methods of cultivation followed in this district present no peculiar features, and do not differ in any way from those in vogue in Ghasipur and Azamgarh. Improvements in implements, system and seed are practically unknown: the cultivator remains satisfied with his primitive plough, his simple means of fertilizing the soil, the traditional rotation of crops, and he pays no attention to the selection of seed. There is, however, an exception to the last rule in the case of rice grown in the Suraha Tal; the cultivators never use the rice grown on the spot for seed in the same locality, but import rice for sowing purposes from the Ratoi lake in Azamgarh. There are the usual harvests, known by the usual names. On an average, taking the figures of the five years ending in 1906, the area sown for the rabi or spring harvest has been 348,236 acres, while 344,570 acres have been cultivated each year in the kharif and 3,200 acres in the zaid or intermediate harvest. The relative position of the spring and autumn harvests not only varies with the nature of the season, but is very different in the different parts of the district. The rabi very largely preponderates in the Ballia tahsil, while in the other subdivisions the kharif covers the greater area, and notably in Rasra, the chief rice-producing tract. The soil of the eastern parganas is rich but light, and is best adapted to the production of barley, gram and peas. Much of the land is inundated during the rains, and consequently no autumn crops can be grown; maize, which is the chief kharif staple being raised on the higher lands. In the west, on the other hand, the soil is of a heavier description and a large proportion bears rice, while this crop is seldom to be seen in the eastern half of the district.\n\nTaking the district as a whole, the largest area covered by any crop in the kharif harvest is that occupied by rice, which for the last five years has averaged 98,814 acres or 28-7 per cent. of the land cropped. The highest proportion in any one\npargana is 55 per cent. in Bhadaon, while throughout the Rasra tehsil and in pargana Sikandarpur East the figure is well above the district average. In Kharid it closely approaches the latter amount, but in the Ballia tehsil very little rice is produced, and this is notably the case in Doaba, where the nature of the soil renders the cultivation of this crop almost unknown. The rice grown in this district is of many different varieties: about 72 per cent. consists of the late or transplanted rice, known as jardan, which is of a much superior quality and yields a far larger output than the dhan or early rice. Next in order comes maize, which averages 67,035 acres or 16-6 per cent. of the harvest. The great bulk of this crop is raised in the Ballia tehsil, and especially in the parganas of Doaba and Ballia, in the former comprising two-thirds of the area sown. As in most districts, it has grown in popularity during late years, and is of great value as providing a food supply even in seasons when the rains cease prematurely. This staple is also grown to a large extent in pargana Kharid, but elsewhere its cultivation is very limited, and little more than five hundred acres of maize are to be found in the entire Rasra tehsil. The various millets hold a relatively unimportant position in this district. The chief is the small and inferior kind known as kodon, which covers on an average 44,817 acres or 13 per cent. of the harvest. The largest areas are to be found in Kharid and Doaba, where this crop accounts for 29-3 and 20-3 per cent. of the kharif respectively; elsewhere the figure is below the average, though it is fairly high throughout the Ballia tehsil and in the eastern half of Rasra. The other millets have fallen off during recent years: mandua is grown in all parts to the extent of some 7,000 acres; bajra covers 5,500 acres, chiefly in the western half of the Ballia tehsil; and jute about 1,400 acres, this being mainly confined to Garha and Kopachit East. A fair amount of jwar is also cultivated in combination with arhar; the mixture averaging some 6,000 acres; but arhar is more commonly sown by itself, and in this form averages 21,532 acres or 6-2 per cent. of the harvest. Two-fifths of this amount are to be found in pargana Sikandarpur East, and the bulk of the remainder in Sikandarpur West and Bhadaon, while in other parts of the district\nthe crop is unimportant, especially in the Ballia tahsil. The most notable feature of the kharif cultivation in this district is the large area under sugarcane, which averages 40,614 acres or 11.8 per cent. of the harvest. It is grown uniformly over the greater part of the district except in the Ballia tahsil, and especially the Doalm and Garha parganas, where very little is to be seen; there is, however, a large amount in Kopachit East. Mention will be made later of the manufacture of sugar, which is still the most important industry of Ballia, although it has declined during the past twenty years, as also has the area occupied by this crop. The other products of the kharif are quite insignificant. They include some 2,500 acres under the various pulses known as urd, mung and moth, a fair area under the millet called sarsona, and negligible amounts of garden crops, cotton and indigo. The last was once grown to some extent, but has now practically disappeared, and only survives in pargana Garha.\n\nIn the rabi harvest the lead is taken by barley. This crop, when sown by itself, covers on an average 81,646 acres or 24 per cent. of the entire area cultivated. The proportion varies considerably in different parts of the district, for while in the Bansdih tahsil and in the parganas of Sikandarpur West and Ballia it closely approaches the general figure, no less than 52.4 per cent. of the rabi cultivation in Lakhnassar is devoted to barley, and in Kopachit also the area is much larger than elsewhere. On the other hand the crop occupies a very secondary place in Doalm and Garha. There the place of barley sown alone is generally taken by wheat or by barley in combination with other staples, such as wheat or gram. The area of barley mixed with gram averages 31,170 acres or 8.9 per cent. of the rabi harvest, ranging from 21 per cent. in Doalm to practically nothing in Lakhnassar. A still larger proportion is sown with wheat, which by itself is comparatively seldom to be found in this district. Whether grown alone, or mixed with barley or gram, wheat accounts for 67,315 acres; taking the average of the returns for the past five years; it thus covers 19.3 per cent. of the rabi area, this amount being considerably exceeded in the Bansdih tahsil and closely approached in Ballia, while in Rasra the\nproportion is little more than 12 per cent., pargana Lakhnesar coming last with only 8.5 per cent. The remainder of the rabi harvest is taken up for the most part by gram sown alone and by peas. The former averages 50,880 acres or 14.6 per cent., of which over 38,000 acres are found in the Ballia tahsil and less than 6,000 acres in Rasra. Peas, which constitute an important item in the food supply of the poorer classes, average 83,880 acres or 24.7 per cent. of the rabi area, and are grown in every part of the district, particularly in the western and northern parganas, the highest proportion being 40 per cent. in Sikandarpur West and Bhadaon. Mention may also be made of poppy cultivation, rather on account of its intrinsic value than of its actual extent. The total area averages 3,757 acres and this is distributed over all the parganas, although the figures for Bhadaon and Garha are very small; the largest average is recorded in Kharid and the two parganas of Sikandarpur. Other Ehrif products include linseed, to the extent of some 4,000 acres; masur or lentils, aggregating about 5,400 acres and chiefly grown in the Ballia tahsil and particularly pargana Garha; and small amounts of oilseeds, tobacco, potatoes, vegetables and other garden crops. Market gardening is of no great importance in this district, owing chiefly to the absence of any large towns; as is to be expected, it is most extensively practised in the Ballia tahsil.\n\nThe various crops grown in the said or intermediate harvest call for little comment. They consist mainly of the early millet known as chena, which covers some 1,580 acres; melons, which are grown on the sandy banks of the rivers and average 920 acres in area; vegetables of different descriptions, and the hot weather rice called boro, which is raised on the edges of the Suraha Tal and the other large lakes, and occupies about 360 acres annually.\n\nThe district is well provided with means of irrigation, and to this reason may be assigned its comparative immunity from famine. The security of the tract is more firmly established than at first sight appears from the actual figures, the reason being that so large a proportion of the land lies low and consists of recent alluvium, in which no artificial irrigation is required.\nsufficient moisture being supplied by capillary attraction. The whole of pargana Doaba is of this nature, and the same remark applies to extensive stretches of country in the Ballia and Garha parganas along the Ganges. Irrigation is consequently necessary in the older formations alone, and is most generally practised in the Rasra tahsil. A comparison of recent statistics with those of former years is impracticable, inasmuch as it was then the custom to record all land as irrigated which was within reach of water. The old figures moreover included the rice lands, which are no longer treated as irrigated. There the rainfall is retained in the fields by the low embankments that surround them, so that this form of irrigation depends solely on the monsoon and is in no sense a precaution against drought, but rather the mere retention on the land of the seasonal fall. Actual figures of irrigation are available from 1886 onwards. For the ten years ending in 1895 the average area irrigated was 182,107 acres or 35-08 per cent. of the net cultivation, the maximum being 197,081 acres or 40-5 per cent. in 1890-91, and the minimum 171,621 acres or 34-6 per cent. two years later. For the succeeding decade from 1896 to 1905 the irrigated area averaged 185,298 acres or 34-73 per cent. of the area cultivated, so that while the actual amount shows a distinct increase it has not kept pace with the extension of cultivation. The proportion is still, however, remarkably high, especially when it is remembered that in so large a tract no irrigation whatever is required. The capacity of the district may be estimated in some measure from the fact that in the dry year of 1896-97 as much as 30-8 per cent. of the total cultivation received artificial watering, while the maximum irrigated area was 205,146 acres or 39 per cent. in 1899 to 1900. Among the different parganas Bhalan and Kopachit West come first with an average of nearly 60 per cent. of the cultivated area irrigated, while the general figure for the district is largely exceeded throughout the upland tract. Sikandarpur West and Sikandarpur East average 58 and 53 per cent. respectively, and the latter proportion is closely approached in Kopachit East and Lakhnesar. In the south and east of the district the condition of affairs is very different. Pargana Khard, which contains a large proportion of lowlying alluvium, shows less than 27 per\ncent. of irrigation, and Ballia only 13-8 per cent. The remaining parganas of Garha and Doaba take the lowest position, with no more than 4-4 and 1-8 per cent. respectively. There are no large tracts which suffer from a deficiency of water, though there are some portions in Kharid, Bhadaon, and the two parganas of Sikandarpur in which the rice crop depends solely on the monsoon.\n\nTurning to the sources from which irrigation derived, we find that wells are by far the most important in every part of the district. This is the more satisfactory, as they constitute a more reliable source of supply than the tanks, the natural reservoirs and the streams, all of which are liable to fail in seasons when water is most required. The position, too, has been improved of late years, for whereas from 1886 to 1895 of the irrigation obtained from wells was 67-13 per cent. of the whole, leaving 32-87 per cent. supplied from other sources, in the ensuing decade the returns show that 79-48 per cent. of the area obtaining irrigation was served by wells, 13-06 per cent. from tanks, and 7-46 per cent. from other sources. Actually the highest proportion of well irrigation is to be found in pargana Doaba, but there the total quantity is so small as to be negligible. In the regularly irrigated tracts, with the exception of Sikandarpur West and Bhadaon, wells supplied on an average from 80 to 87 per cent. of the irrigated area. In the two western parganas the figure is lower, owing to the greater use which is there made of tanks and natural sources, and in Bhadaon no more than 56 per cent. of the irrigation is derived from wells, the corresponding figure for Sikandarpur West being 74 per cent.\n\nWells can be made in most parts of the district, and the only obstacle encountered in their construction is the sandy nature of the subsoil in the low lands along the rivers. In the latter tract the wells, unless made of masonry, fall in during the rains, and in almost every case they have to be protected by ropes of straw coiled round the sides in order to keep them in working order for a single season. The depth at which water is found varies with the height of the surface above the level of the sea, or rather of the Ganges and Ghagra. In the alluvial tracts it averages about 15 feet, while in the uplands it ranges from 15 to 40 feet, the average being little more than 20 feet. The\nunprotected wells which fill by lateral percolation are usually shallow, from 15 to 20 feet deep, and are not intended to last for more than a single season; while permanent wells are usually sunk to a much greater depth in order to secure a constant flow of water. The number of these permanent masonry wells is very large and exhibits a constant tendency to increase. During the five years ending in 1906 the average number employed for irrigation was 11,573, while in the last year it had risen to 12,257. These wells vary in size and quality, most of those built about the village site being of a superior description and used for drinking purposes as well as for irrigation. Such a well, with a large cylinder and sunk to a great depth, will sometimes cost as much as Rs. 2,000, while a less pretentious well made for irrigation alone can generally be made for about Rs. 200, the average price of all masonry wells being perhaps double this sum. The number of unprotected or kuchha wells varies with the requirements of the season, and for the last five years has averaged 6,857, including those wells only which are actually employed for watering the fields. It is a common practice to dig such a well for the sole benefit of a particular crop such as sugarcane; they do their duty at any rate till harvest time, and have the advantage of extreme cheapness, the cost rarely exceeding Rs. 5, and commonly being no more than half of this sum. Where the underlying strata are tolerably firm, the shaft is not strengthened in any way, but when beds of sand are struck it is necessary to provide support by means of a stout cable made of arhar stalks, tamarisk, or long thatching grass, which is coiled round the inside of the well where the stratum threatens to give way, and generally retains its position during the short period for which it is required.\n\nWells are worked after several different methods. The most common is that known as the dhembal or lever, which consists of a long pole, with a lump of mud on the thinker end to serve as a weight, while at the other is an earthenware pot suspended by a rope. The pole is set upon a strong support fixed in the ground at a distance of a few feet from the well, the upper end being forked and holding the axle on which the pole oscillates. The labourer who works the lever stands with his back to it, upon\na plank which is so laid across the well as to leave a space between\nthe edge of the latter so as to permit the passage of the pot.\nPulling down the lever by the rope he thus lowers the pot into\nthe well, and when full allows it to rise by the action of the lever,\nemptying the water into the channel at the top of the well. The\npot usually contains somewhat less than two gallons of water,\nand sometimes as many as four levers may be seen at work at\nthe same time. The rapidity of working depends on the depth\nof the well, but on an average the pot is not filled more than three\ntimes in a minute. In this fashion one-seventh or one-eighth of\nan acre may be irrigated with one lever in the course of the day,\nand when using the dhenkal more water is lost by evaporation\nand absorption than in those methods which give a larger and\nfaster stream in the distributing channel. In this process two\nmen are required, one for working the lever and one for guiding\nthe water; but when two or more levers are at work the process\nis naturally cheaper. Thus when one lever is employed and two\nmen are at work, an acre can be irrigated in seven or eight days\nat a cost of Re. 1-2-8, whereas four levers and five men can water\nthe same area in two days, the total charge being Re. 0-11-8.\nThe ordinary rate of pay is 1\u00bd ser of coarse grain, equivalent to\none anna or one anna three paisa, but the work is generally stopped\nat midday. The dhenkal is of course only possible where the\nwater-level is high, and the same remark applies to the charkhi.\nThe latter is seldom to be seen in this district, being more\ncommon in Azamgarh. The charkhi is a wooden pulley fitted\nupon supports over the well, and over it runs a rope, to each end\nof which an earthenware pot is attached. The labourer stands\non the plank over the well, and while forcing down one end of\nthe rope, he brings up the other with the vessel full of water.\nThis form of irrigation is more laborious than in the case of the\ndhenkal, and the results are much the same, about one-seventh of\nan acre being watered daily, at the same cost as a single-lever\nwell. In the case of the larger and deeper wells the most general\nsystem is that known as the purwati. Here a large leather\nbucket is hung on a rope which works over the pulley fixed on\nsupports on the top of the well, and is drawn up by bullocks\ndriven down an incline. Under this system three men are\nrequired, one to drive the bullocks, one to empty the basket, and the third to distribute the water, so that the expense is considerably greater, although at the same time this is compensated by the fact that the pur or bucket holds 14 or 15 gallons. The cost of irrigating an acre depends mainly on the size of the well, for unless the supply is abundant the well is soon exhausted and work must be stopped till it refills. The system has also the advantage of rapidity, for half an acre can be watered in a day. In some cases bullocks are replaced by human labour, and the method is then known as ghara. When this is done, eleven men are usually employed, six being at work on the rope, two in emptying and distributing the water, and three in relief. In this manner rather better results are obtained, the pur being emptied not less than three times in two minutes, while the work continues more steadily than is the case with bullocks. On an average from one-half to three-quarters of an acre is irrigated in a day, but though more economical, the system is far less common than the purwati.\n\nLike all the eastern districts, Ballia contains a large number of artificial tanks for irrigation purposes, many of these being of considerable age. The more recently constructed tanks are rarely used for this purpose, being reserved for bathing and the watering of cattle. These tanks vary in size, and generally cover less than an acre; they are not more than 20 feet in depth, and are of square or oblong shape, with usually a kachcha well reaching to the spring level in the centre. The earth removed in excavation forms a high bank round the sides, so that the tanks are conspicuous features in the landscape, commonly resembling old mud forts, but occasionally with trees or scrub jungle on the embankments. Two or three openings are left at the corners, not only to enable the water to be taken out, but also to allow a certain amount of the surface drainage of the neighbourhood to fill the tank during the rainy season. The water is generally raised from the tank to the field by means of the dauri, a round shallow basket made of wicker or bamboo matting. Attached to the basket are four strings, one of which is held in either hand by two labourers, who stand opposite to each other on either side of the hauling station or bodar. There are usually two of these\nbodars, though frequently this number is exceeded. The basket is swung between the men, being carried above the water in the back stroke and into it with the forward stroke; in finishing the latter the men swing the dhowri up with a jerk, so as to throw the water carried in the basket into the top of the lift. Fully two gallons of water are brought up at each stroke, and from 20 to 25 strokes are made in a minute; the number varying with the height, which ranges from two to five feet. The labour is somewhat arduous, and as a rule two pairs of labourers with two baskets are kept working at each lift, and two pairs are allowed as a relief party. In this manner about half an acre can be irrigated daily, the cost varying according to the number of lifts and other circumstances. Another system employed in tanks is that known as the dhowri or don. This is a hollow boat-shaped piece of wood about 15 feet long, closed at the narrow end and open at the other. It is placed on a ridge with the closed end projecting over the tank or jhil, being supported by a rope which passes over a pole and is held by the worker. The latter sinks the closed end by pressure with his foot until it fills with water, and then raises it by means of the rope so as to cause the water to flow to the open end and into the irrigation channel leading to the field. Water can be raised in this manner to a height of about three feet.\n\nOther sources of irrigation are the natural jhils, swamps, and the smaller watercourses. The larger rivers are not as a rule employed for this purpose; not only is there a difficulty in raising the water, but in most cases no necessity exists for watering the lands in their immediate neighbourhood. The Kachar water is somewhat extensively employed for irrigation in pargana Ballia, and is dammed at certain points in its course, as also are several of the minor streams. Water is raised from the rivers and jhils in exactly the same manner as from the tanks, while in convenient places the dhonku is also to be seen.\n\nBallia has seldom been visited by famines of any great magnitude or intensity, though it has not wholly escaped from the more serious calamities of this nature which have fallen upon the United Provinces and Bengal. Of early famines there are no records extant, and all that is known belongs rather to the\nhistory of the Ghazipur district, of which Ballia formed till quite recently a component part. In every instance, however, the pressure caused by unfavourable seasons, was lighter here than in less fortunately situated tracts; for the heavy rainfall combined with the high water level render the district to a certain extent immune from the effects of a partial failure or a premature cessation of the monsoon.\n\nThe first occasion regarding which any definite information is available was the scarcity of 1863-69, when a deficient rainfall affected nineteen districts, although real distress was experienced only in Jhansi and Bijnor. In the eastern parts of Ghazipur the pinch of high prices began to be felt towards the end of 1868, but no relief measures were deemed necessary. The rabi harvest was very inferior and with the advent of the hot weather distress became more general, and was aggravated by the delay in the arrival of the monsoon. Relief works were started on the 12th of June and were maintained till the 10th of September 1869. The total number of persons thus supported in Ghazipur and Ballia was 63,802 or 624 per diem, the latter figure averaging over 1,000 during the last week in July and the first seven days of August. The total does not include that of parganas Sikandarpur and Bhadon, which then belonged to Azamgarh, but in this part no great scarcity was experienced, and the relief consisted merely in the grant of doles to the aged and infirm.\n\nIn 1873 the rains came late and the fall was very scanty, with the result that the rice crop failed and prices rose to an unusual height, the effect being enhanced by the succession of indifferent harvests in the preceding years. By the cold weather the distress had become general, and the prospect became more gloomy in January 1874, when a severe frost did widespread injury to the peas and other delicate crops. In the following month, however, a moderately heavy fall of rain removed all danger of a real famine, especially in Ghazipur and Ballia, so that the distress abated with the harvest, and though relief measures were continued throughout the hot weather the number of persons fell to a small figure, and the last work closed on the 22nd of July. For combating the scarcity on this occasion,\nrelief works were started in February, the total expenditure under this head being Rs. 13,116, while about Rs. 6,900 were devoted to poorhouses and cash doles. Added to this, the railway rates were reduced, so as to render cheap the importation of grain from the Punjab; nothing could be obtained from Bengal, which suffered far more than the United Provinces.\n\nThe works in the Ballia portion of the Ghazipur district were of two kinds, temporary and permanent. The former comprised the repair of the road from Ballia to Rasra and Ghazipur; widening and embanking roads at Sahatwar and Bairia; and the excavation of a tank at Rasra. The permanent works included the construction of a road from Pardhaanpur on the Sarja to Rasra and thence to Nagra; the improvement of the road from Sikandarpur to Garwar; and the erection of an embankment through a jhil near Bansdih. The average number of persons relieved in the whole of the Ghazipur district was 1,296 daily; but with the reaping of the rabi harvest, which was the best known for years, the attendance declined, with the result that all the works were closed gradually, and by May only those in pargana Lakhnesar remained. There the distress appears to have been greatest, and the reason assigned for this fact was the extreme density of the population, the average at that time being 771 to the square mile, or more than in any other pargana of the United Provinces. As compared with the other eastern districts, Ballia escaped lightly on this occasion, and experienced nothing like the distress that prevailed in Basti and Gorakhpur; the result was mainly due to the opportune rain that fell here in January and February and secured an excellent harvest on a fairly full area.\n\nWhen the next famine occurred in 1877-78, Ballia was still an integral portion of the Ghazipur district. On this occasion the rains broke in the beginning of July, but after three days a break ensued, and till the beginning of August only a few scanty showers were received. August began well, but on the 6th the rain ceased, and for most of the month a scorching wind blew and continued without cessation till the end of the month, when a storm passed over Ghazipur and the adjoining tracts. This was followed by heavy rain on the 10th and 11th of September;\nbut for the rest of the month strong easterly winds did great damage, and it was not till the 5th of October that rain fell in abundance. The result was seen in a great contraction of the kharif area and in an outturn which was estimated at one-fourth of the normal, except in the Ghagra valley and the neighbourhood of the Saraha Tal, where about half an average crop was realized. The rice naturally suffered most; but the other staples fared little better and prices rose to an unprecedented height. The winter was marked by extremes of temperature, which added to the distress of the poorest classes, and the prospect of a fair rabi was marred by hailstorms, high winds and rust. The harvest brought some relief, but the costliness of food grains and apprehensions as to the monsoon of 1878 caused renewed anxiety; the rains, however, though scanty, were well timed, and the kharif was above the average, so that the gains resulting from the state of the market amply recouped the cultivators for the losses they had undergone. As a matter of fact, Ballia was but slightly affected by this famine. In the lowlying tracts the harvests were of course distinctly poor, but there was no acute distress. The Rasra tahsil was less fortunate, but even there the relief works attracted but few labourers: no remissions of revenue were granted, and few formal suspensions were made, though the payment of a certain amount of arrears was allowed to stand over till the following year. The people were not impoverished at the beginning, and consequently were enabled to tide over the loss of one harvest, and the only sufferers were the casual labourers and those in receipt of low fixed salaries.\n\nIn the last famine of 1896-97 Ballia remained practically unaffected, and was even better off than Ghazipur. The tract was thus far more fortunate than either Azamgarh or Gorakhpur, in both of which famine conditions prevailed. In 1895-96 both harvests were well up to the average, and consequently there were ample stocks in hand at the commencement of the new agricultural year, at any rate for four months. The kharif of 1896 only failed so far as the rice was concerned, or to the extent of less than one-third: the early rice gave a five-anna crop, but the late or transplanted variety was almost wholly lost, while\nfor other crops the harvest was about three-fourths of the normal. In the ensuing rabi about 80 per cent. of the usual area was sown, and more than half of this was protected by wells. It was proposed to suspend a proportion of the kharif revenue, but all that was done was to postpone payment for two months, and though ample provision for relief works was made, they were never carried into effect. The rabi of 1897 proved good, and consequently all anxiety was dispelled. The only tract which suffered in any way was pargana Bhadaon, on the Azamgarh border; but even there the distress was not of a severe nature, and test works failed to attract labourers. Since that time the district has remained immune, and on no occasion have any measures of relief been either mooted or sanctioned.\n\nNo separate records are extant to show the prices of food grains in Ballia prior to its formation as an independent district. It may be assumed that the rates were practically identical with those of Azamgarh and Ghazipur, although the remote position of the tract and its inaccessibility at that time, rendering export trade more difficult than in the case of the larger districts, combined to keep prices lower in Ballia than in the adjoining territories. It appears that in this district, as elsewhere, a distinct rise in prices took place shortly after the mutiny, or about 1860, and that this rise continued for a period of about 15 years. Apart from temporary fluctuations caused by the variation in the nature of the seasons, it seems that prices remained practically stationary, or even declined, between 1875 and 1885. About the latter year prices rose to a marked extent throughout northern India, the phenomenon being ascribed to widespread economic causes, among which the fall in the value of silver, the development of communications, and the growth of export trade together, figure prominently. This rise, though sudden at the beginning, was progressive and has continued with several occasional fluctuations to the present day. Its extent may be estimated from the available returns, which show that between 1886 and 1895 the average price of wheat was 15-22 seer to the rupee, of barley 21-52 seer, of common rice 14-62 seer, of gram 21-47 seer, of maize 21-30 seer, and of arhar 20-23 seer, these being the chief food grains produced in the district. The ensuing decade was\nremarkable for the famine of 1897 and for the scarcity which prevailed in many parts of India in 1900. Both of these had a great effect on local prices, and consequently the average is somewhat vitiated; though the upward tendency does not seem to have been checked in any degree by the subsequent years of prosperity. The figures for the ten years ending in 1905 were wheat, 12-62 sars; barley, 18 sars; rice, 11-51 sars; gram, 17-19 sars; maize, 19-16 sars; and arhar, 13-30 sars. The enhanced market value is apparent and calls for no further comment, but for the reason given above it is practically impossible to form an exact estimate on the extent to which prices have risen. From 1860 to 1865 wheat and barley averaged 24 and 30 sars respectively in the Azamgarh district, and from these figures we obtain an increase of a great deal more than 50 per cent. during the following forty years. This is probably an approximation to the actual condition of affairs, as the same results are obtained in the case of other districts of the Benares division.\n\nIt is still less easy to determine the change in the daily wages. These differ in the towns and the villages, being generally higher in the former; while rates further vary according to the nature of the work, even in the case of ordinary field labourers. The latter are very frequently professional ploughmen, who are granted one bigha of land rent-free in addition to their regular wages, which again are more commonly paid in kind. The rent of this land would amount to Rs. 8 per annum if leased to a subtenant, so that the grant actually represents an addition of about four pies to the daily wage. In 1882 agricultural labourers were estimated to receive two annas daily, and at the present day the rate is practically the same, excluding the customary grant of land. For ploughing and sowing remuneration is 2\u00bd sars of coarse grain, equivalent in money to about two annas; for wooding and watering it is 1\u00bd sars, or half the former amount; for digging and thrashing the rate is 1\u00bdth sars or 1\u00bd annas; while for reaping the labourer obtains one bundle in 16, approximately 0\u00bd sars of grain or five annas in the day. Women, who are extensively employed in the lighter forms of field work, such as weeding and watering, customarily obtain two-thirds of a man's wage. Consequently it will be observed that the rate of wages\ndepends but very little on current prices. So far as the latter have risen, wages have increased at the same time, owing to the greater value of the grant given as remuneration; but the increase cannot be appreciated in cash, as the wage merely serves as food for the day for the labourer and his family. Where cash wages are paid the increase becomes more apparent. In 1882 a field labourer obtained as a rule Rs. 3-12-0 monthly, and a common artisan Rs. 7-8-0; while the corresponding figures for 1905 were Rs. 4-6-0 and Rs. 11-4-0 respectively. At the present time a good journeyman carpenter or mason obtains eight annas a day, while a mistri in either trade gets from Rs. 18 to Rs. 20 per month.\n\nThe weights and measures in use in this district present several peculiarities, being in many respects different from those in vogue in Oudh and the western divisions of the United Provinces. The Government standards are, it is true, very frequently employed, and their use is becoming more general with the improvement of communications and earlier means of access to the outer world; but the people are very conservative and cling to the old customs with great tenacity. In measures of length the unit is the jota or barley corn, of which three go to the inch, two inches making an angul, and three anguls making one girah. Of the latter four go to the span and eight to the hath or cubit. This is a common measure everywhere and is equivalent to half a gas or yard. It should be noted that in field measurements the yard is smaller than the English measure, being only 33 inches in length. A different gas is employed for measuring cloth and the like, and this is 37\u00bd inches. Three yards or six cubits make a katha, so called from its usually taking the form of a bamboo rod; in the Rasna taluq it is a common practice for zamindars in dealing with their tenants to treat the katha as only 6\u00bd hathas. The chain or jarib, here universally known as the rassai or rope, is made up of 20 kathas, while 32 rassais make a dhap or mile, two dhapes making the kos. Another somewhat peculiar measure of length is the jorai or fathom of four kathas. This is equivalent to the baha of other districts and is only employed for denoting the depth of water being conventionally supposed to be the height reached by a man.\nwith his hands extended above his head. For measures of area the unit is the square latha, called a dhur; while in the Rasa tahsil this is also equivalent to a square of three gunams or paces. Twenty such dhurs make one bigha or bah, and 20 biswas one bigha, the latter being, as usual, five-eighths of an acre.\n\nA variant of this scale is found in Rasa, where the bigha is sometimes divided into four mandas, each of these being equal to five lathas; this measurement is only employed, however, for denoting shares in the maha or village. In the same connection we find the usual division of land by annas and rupees, but the anna is divided in different ways in different places. In one case there are the usual 12 pies, further subdivided into 20 kanta, each of which is nine jans; in another the anna equals 60 bais, the latter being made up of three sales; and in another one anna is equivalent to 20 gunams, the gunam being four kauris, the kauri 30 dants, and the dant 30 daanlis. Where the bigha-dan system is adopted, the bigha is subdivided into 20 biswas or bahs, the bah into 20 dhurs, as before; the dhur into 20 reas, and the rea into 20 phans.\n\nFor measures of weight the Government standard ser of 80 tolas is very frequently used, but there is a local ser based on the thick square lump of copper known as the Gorakhpuri pani. The latter is found throughout the eastern districts and is still employed as a current coin, though to a much less extent than was formerly the case. Its value has also depreciated, as not long ago 80 went to the rupee or five to the anna, while the usual price is now 6\u00bd per anna or 10\u00bd to the rupee. Four of these pie make a gunam, and 28 gunams make the local palta ser, this being equal in weight to 104 current rupees or three-tenths heavier than the standard measure. There is also a local kachha ser of 14 gunams, or exactly half the larger measure. A very common weight is the panseri of five sera, eight of these going to the anna. This, however, is by no means peculiar to Ballia, being the commonest unit of weight in all parts of the province.\n\nThe prevailing rates of interest found in this district call for no detailed comment, being much the same as in all parts of the Benares and Gorakhpur divisions. The rates vary not\nonly according to the kind of loan, but also according to the circumstances attending the transaction. Generally speaking, it may be laid down that interest on a usufructuary mortgage varies from 6 to 12 per cent.; on a simple mortgage from 12 to 18 per cent.; and on an unsecured loan from 18 to 24 per cent. per annum. No exact rule can be asserted, as so much depends on the personal element in each case; the higher rates are undoubtedly severe, but they are usually commensurate with the risk involved. The most common loans take the form of advances of seed corn. These are repaid at harvest with the addition of interest calculated at one-fourth of the principal, this rate being known as siera. As a matter of fact, it usually amounts to a great deal more, for at the time of lending the corn is entered at its cash value, and the principal to be repaid is again converted into corn after harvest, when prices are much lower than at seed time. There are no large banking firms in the district, the only establishments being those of the local Mahajans, and up to the present time no attempt has been made to start village banks.\n\nThough by no means an industrial district, the manufactures of Ballia are of some importance and in one or two instances afford employment to a large number of persons. The chief are sugar, saltpetre and country cloth, each of which will be mentioned separately. Of the remainder, indigo at one time occupied a prominent position, but is now almost extinct. The business was wholly in the hands of natives, with the exception of branches of the Galmar factory in Ghazipur, at Parmanadapur, Kapuri and Saraya. Of late years, however, nearly all the factories have been closed, as the result of the decline in the price of natural indigo and the competition of the synthetic dye. In 1905 the area under indigo was only 13 acres in the whole district; this rose in 1906 to 156 acres, owing to the establishment of a new factory at Bilari in pargana Garha, though it remains to be seen whether the enterprise will flourish any better than its predecessors. At Sikandarpur there is a distillery for the production of ilt or otto of roses and other scented oils, which are exported to Calcutta and elsewhere, having a reputation equal to that of similar products made at Ghazipur. The pottery of the district has no distinctive features, nor has the metal work,\nexcept in the case of the white metal vessels manufactured at Turtipar; these at one time had a considerable reputation, but the trade has declined, though a fair quantity is still produced. At Ballia iron trays, angelas or stoves, and waterpots are made and exported. Other manufactures comprise the palanquins made at Sahatwur and sold in large numbers at the Dudri fair and elsewhere; the embroidered saddles and palanquin covers made by the Julahas of Bairia; and the shoes turned out at Tikha Deori and Sikaria in the Rasra tahsil. The only steam-power factories in the district are two flour-mills recently started at Ballia.\n\nThough there has been a considerable decline of late years, the sugar industry is still important. In 1882 there were no fewer than 571 refineries in the district with a net profit of over Rs. 500 in each case, as well as a number of smaller concerns. At the present time the total probably does not exceed 250, but the business is still fairly flourishing, and the produce is reckoned among the best sugar manufactured in India by the native process. The decline is due to the competition of foreign sugar, particularly that of Mauritius, and it is to this fact that the wholesale closing of factories must be attributed, as well as the precarious condition of many existing concerns. Though the export trade has fallen off, the local reputation of the sugar still remains, especially of that produced at Hanumanganj. In the Ballia tahsil the principal refineries are at Hanumanganj, Parkhauji and Ballia itself, these places containing 24 considerable factories; in Banadih at Jijauli, Nawangar, Mairitar and Maniar; and in Rasra at Lahaani, Athila and Kotwari. The sugar is for the most part made from gur produced in this district, though considerable quantities are imported from Gorakhpur, Saran and Shahabad. It should be noted that only chini is manufactured here, and not misri or crystallized sugar. The gur is first melted and then stored in wands or large earthen pots. After being clarified with sugar, a weed which grows in great abundance in the Suraha Tal and other lakes, the thin liquor is allowed to percolate through the bottom of the wand, leaving a deposit of dry sugar, which is scraped up by means of a broad-pointed iron instrument called a pachhni. The sugar is then spread on a\ncoarse cloth and rubbed with the feet till it becomes white. The product is styled first-class sugar, that of the second class being obtained from the liquor which has escaped from the hand, the refuse from this process being similarly treated so as to produce third-class sugar. What then remains is called shira, and is used for the distillation of country spirit.\n\nThe returns of the last census showed that in 1901 no fewer than 20,000 persons, including dependents, derived a subsistence from cotton-weaving. They are mainly Julahas and Koria, and the industry is almost wholly confined to the villages in which these castes reside. The cloth produced is of the ordinary coarse variety known as garba, and finer fabrics are seldom to be seen. The best is that produced at Karammar in the Banadil tahsil, whence large quantities are exported to Nepal. The chief centres of the industry are at Guthnuli, Middha, Bairia, Raghunathpur, Bhalsaud and Dubband in the Ballia tahsil; at Booti, Sahatwar, Karammar, Maniar, Sikandarpur, Koora, Birnarhari and Hasinabad in tahsil Banadil; and at Rasra, Nagpura, Athila, Jam and Bilaunjha in tahsil Rasra. As elsewhere, there has been a considerable decline in the trade of late years, owing to the growing preference for European and factory-made goods; but there is still a fair local demand for country cloth among the rural population.\n\nSince the introduction of Act XXXI of 1861 the manufacture of saltpetre has been under the control of the inland customs department and is only permitted under license. For making crude saltpetre a license fee of Rs. 2 is charged, while for refining saltpetre and adzing salt in the process the cost is Rs. 50, the license running for a year from the 1st of August. The industry in this district is in the hands of Lunias, who usually commence operations in December and continue to work till the advent of the monsoon. The process of manufacture is simple in the extreme. Under each license two filter-beds and one iron boiler are permitted, the former being circular, some three or four feet in diameter, and from eight inches to a foot in depth. At the bottom is an earthen vessel, and the sides of the filter are lined with grass. The nitrous earth and red collected from water land are placed in the filter, which is filled\nwith water; the latter percolates through the grass to the vessel beneath, and is then boiled for three or four hours, after which it is left to stand for two or three days in earthen vessels. At the end of that time saltpetre mixed with earth is deposited on the sides of the vessel, and in this form it is sold to the refiners at a rate varying from Rs. 1-8-0 to Rs. 3 per maund. The liquor that remains is strongly impregnated with salt, and according to law should be thrown away; though very frequently the Lunia boils it for an hour and obtains the salt by precipitation.\n\nIn 1905 no fewer than 422 licenses for crude saltpetre were taken out; this shows the extent of the industry in some degree, but it is impossible to say to obtain any figures regarding the quantity produced. In the refineries the crude saltpetre yields about fifty per cent. of the refined article and a varying amount of salt. The latter is not permitted to leave the refinery till the excise duty of Rs. 1-8-0 per maund has been paid. If excised, it is sold locally; but the recent reduction of the duty places superior salt on the market at a very little higher rate than that produced in the refineries, and consequently a large proportion of the salt produced is destroyed. The saltpetre made in the refineries is either obtained from crude saltpetre or else from nitrous earth directly by filtration, the latter being known as kuthia and containing a smaller proportion of salt. The two kinds are mixed and exported to Calcutta by rail or river, and are thence despatched to China, America and elsewhere. The price varies from Rs. 6 to Rs. 9 per maund, the rate depending on its purity as well as on the state of the market. In the year ending on the 31st of July 1905 there were three refineries at Bansdih, two at Turtipar and one at Mundiazi; the total quantity of refined saltpetre produced was 8,814 maunds, of which 3,259 maunds were of the kuthia variety. The salt produced amounted to 697 maunds, of which 576 maunds were excised, the rest being destroyed with the walls of the refineries.\n\nThe trade of the district consists for the most part in agricultural produce. The chief articles of export are sugar, shira, ghi, wheat, barley, linseed, opium, mustard-oil and hides; while the imports, on the other hand, include rice, kerosene oil, iron, brass and metal vessels, salt, piecegoods and timber.\nIn former days the principal, and indeed the only, trade routes of importance were the rivers. None of the old highways passed through the district, and even at the present time the roads that exist owe their origin for the most part to the river-borne traffic, serving as feeders to connect the local markets of the interior with the principal wharves. The chief riverside marks on the Ganges are at Ballia, Kotwa, Ujjar, Jaahi, and on the Ghagra at Bilthra and Maniar, and Parbodhpur, though neither can compare with the large business centre of Revelganj on the Bengal side of the river. The traffic on the waterways has now been supplanted to a large extent by the various lines of railway which traverse the district. The development of the Bengal and North-Western system has further had a marked effect on the road communications, resulting in the decadence of the routes leading to the markets on the river, their place being now taken by those roads which give access to the stations on the railway. A further change in the direction and relative importance of the trade routes is due to the formation of Ballia as a separate district, in consequence of which several roads, and especially those leading west from the pargana of Sikandarpur to Amargarh, have fallen into comparative disuse.\n\nThe change in the course of trade routes has had a distinct effect on the markets of the district. A list of these will be found in the appendix, but many of them are purely local in character and merely serve to supply the scanty needs of the neighbouring population. The most important bazars are at Ballia, Baragon and Raniganj in the Ballia tahsil; at Bansdih, Maniar, Sikandarpur, Sahatwar and Reoti in tahsil Bansdih; while in the Rasra tahsil the chief are those of Rasra in pargana Lakhnawar, Bilthra, Tari Baragon and Muhammadpur in pargana Sikandarpur West, Chakra in pargana Bhadnon, and Hajauli and Aandi in Kopachit. The general tendency is for those markets on the river and off the line of rail to decrease in importance, the most remarkable instance of this being Bilthra bazar on the Ghagra, while Maniar and Sikandarpur are somewhat similar examples. The town of Ballia, which has the advantage of both river and railway, is rising in importance, but its development has been hampered by the encroachment of the Ganges. The opening of the railway has\ngreatly benefited Saharwar and Roisi, while at the same time Raniganj and Baragon have declined. The case of the latter is somewhat peculiar, as it has the advantage of railway communication; but the probable explanation is that it was never the centre of much trade, but merely a convenient collecting place for the grain of the neighbourhood prior to its conveyance to Rasna, Ballia and other marts.\n\nAnother list given in the appendix shows the fairs held in the district. In each case they are religious in origin, and in many instances the celebration of some festival, whether Hindu or Musalman, is the main object of the assemblage. The larger fairs, however, now derive their importance from their commercial aspect, and though religion still forms the main incentive for the majority of the visitors, the secondary object tends to obscure the original reason for the gathering, particularly at the great Dadri fair. The people are thus enabled both to satisfy the rites of religion, and also to purchase their simple requirements, while enjoying the gaiety and excitement afforded by a large assemblage. By far the most important fair held in the district is the Dadri Mela, which takes place at Ballia on the full moon of Kartik, and attracts some 500,000 persons. The attendance has doubled during the past 20 years, and in the same period there has been a proportionate increase in the volume of trade. The place derives its sanctity from the junction of the Sarju with the Ganges. Formerly this took place to the east of Ballia, but owing to the encroachments of the great river the confluence is now some distance to the west. The fair is still held as near as possible to the old site, the position varying with the action of the river. For some years it has been held on land cultivated as soon as the assemblage disperses. The old temple of Bhirug, which marked the sacred spot, has long been washed away, and a new shrine has been erected to the north-east of Ballia, about a mile from the present site of the fair. The increasing size and importance of the gathering has necessitated more elaborate arrangements than those which were once considered adequate. Two large enclosures are provided for cattle and horses, while shops of all sorts and descriptions are put up in regularly laid-out streets. The sanitary arrangements are in the charge of the Deputy Sanitary\nCommissioner, who remains at Ballia throughout the fair, while a special force of police is deputed to the place to preserve order. A considerable income is derived from entrance fees for cattle and horses, registration fees on all sales, and cesses on the shops. The receipts for the three years ending in 1865 averaged Rs. 13,400, and the expenditure Rs. 5,600, the surplus being credited to municipal funds. During the same period the average number of cattle which passed the barriers was 61,000, and of horses and ponies 4,800, while the average number of sales in each case was 32,800 and 1,890 respectively. There were 1,372 shops, in which articles of every description were exposed for sale; a considerable business is carried on in the matter of tents and palanquins, while the people from all the country round lay in their annual provision of clothing, haberdashery, jewellery and the like. The growth of the fair seems mainly due to the railway, which has rendered the transport of both people and goods far more easy than was formerly the case. In 1882 the receipts amounted to but Rs. 5,860 and the expenditure to Rs. 1,514, figures which amply illustrate the remarkable development of its popularity. Few of the other fairs attain considerable proportion. The largest is held at Ranigunj in pargana Deota, and goes by the name of Sudhakar Baba, a well-known Gosain of the place, who instituted the gathering about 1885. It is held in the month of Aghan in a mango grove close to the village and lasts for about ten days, the attendance on the principal day being about 20,000. A small tax is levied on the shopkeepers by the Dumraon estate, which also makes such arrangements for sanitation as are required. The annual fair at Sonadhi in the north-west corner of pargana Sikandarpur West, some four miles from the Bilthra Road station, takes place in the month of Chait at the local shrine of Bhagwati. The assemblage affords an occasion for a considerable amount of trade, and attracts some 20,000 persons from the neighbourhood.\n\nOn the whole, the district is well provided with means of communication, chiefly owing to the facilities afforded by the railway. With the exception of those that have been metalled, few of the roads are of a good description, and considerable difficulty is experienced in conveying merchandise from the\nvillages to the chief trade centres. This is further illustrated by the small extent to which carts are used in Ballia as compared with the western districts; they are commonly employed along the more serviceable routes, but as a rule most of the local trade is carried on by means of pack-bullocks and ponies. In spite of these drawbacks, the district possesses very fair commercial facilities, as at the present time it is supplied with 89 miles of railway, in addition to 120 miles of river frontage.\n\nThere are three distinct lines of railway, all of which belong to the Bengal and North-Western system. The first portion to be opened was that from Mau in Azamgarh to Turtipar on the Ghagra, on the 8th of June 1898. Of this branch 16 miles lie in the district, and there are stations at Siar, or Bilthra Road, and Kihlidapur. At Turtipar the line crosses the Ghagra by a bridge of 18 spans, being altogether 3,911 feet in length. It was completed in 1903 at a cost of Rs. 20,72,500, the passage over the river being formerly effected by a ferry. On the 16th of March 1899 the branch line from Indara in Azamgarh was opened as far as Phaphna, and the portion from Phaphna to Ballia and Chand Diara on the Ghagra, opposite Revelganj, was completed on the 15th May in the same year, the total length being 60 miles. This line traverses the district from west to east and has stations at Rataiapurna, Rasra, Chikkalpur, Phaphna, Ballia, Bansdih Road, Sahatwar, Reoti, Surenapur and Chand Diara. At present the Ghagra is crossed near the last-mentioned place by a steam ferry leading to Manjhi-ghat on the Bengal side; but the construction has been sanctioned of a bridge at the point, to be completed in four or five years. The third line of railway is that running from Benares to Gharipur and Phaphna, passing through Chit Baragoon, where there is a station. This line was completed on the 11th of March 1903, and since 1905 there has been a through service of trains from Benares to Chand Diara. Among the various projects for further extending the ramifications of the Bengal and North-Western Railway system there is one for which a survey has been sanctioned, for connecting Bansdih Road with Maniar, so as to serve the northern portion of the district, which is still remote from the railway and contains several markets of considerable local importance. It is possible that the new line\nwill be extended, so as to link up Maniar with Sikandarpur and Bilthra Road.\n\nThe roads of the district are all under local management, with the exception of a little more than three miles of metalled road in the new civil station of Ballia. These are at present maintained by the Public Works department and the cost is met from provincial funds. The other roads are kept up by the district board, though the actual work of repairs to the metalled roads is carried out through the agency of the Public Works department. The metalled roads have an aggregate length of some 58 miles, the chief being that from Ghazipur to Ballia, with its branches to Baragnou and Rasra. This road is bridged throughout, save in the case of the Sarju river, which is crossed by a ferry at Pipra, replaced by a temporary pile bridge in the dry weather. From Ballia a metalled road runs to Bansdih, while a second, leading to Sikandarpur, is metalled as far as the market of Hanuman-ganj, the Katchar road being crossed by a bridge at the third mile near Zirahasti. The other metalled roads are either in the town of Ballia or consist of short feeders to the railway stations. The unmetalled roads are of three classes, designated as second class roads, bridged and drained throughout, or, in the case of those going from Ballia to Bairia and Sahatwar, partially bridged and drained; fifth class roads, cleared, partially bridged and drained; and sixth class roads cleared only, the last being in most cases little better than mere cart tracks. The total length of unmetalled road is now 361 miles, and of this 48 miles are of the second, 211 miles of the fifth and 102 miles of the sixth class. In 1882 the total mileage was 372, but at that time there was not a single metalled road in the district. The first to be taken in hand was that to Ghazipur, while the most recent, from Ballia to Bansdih, was completed in 1904. A list of all the roads, both metalled and unmetalled, will be found in the appendix, while their position can be seen on the map attached to this volume. The most important of the unmetalled roads include those from Ballia to Bairia and Sahatwar; from Sikandarpur to Bairia and to Hanuman-ganj; from Bansdih to Piarin on the Rasra road; and from Nagra, once the headquarters of a tahsil, to Rasra, to Garwar and to Ubhaon, Tartipar and the Assamgarh border.\nThere are no encamping-grounds or barracks maintained by Government, but the district is fairly well supplied with inspection bungalows for the use of officials. Those at Ballia and Korantulih are of the first class, and are under the management of the district board. The latter is a fine building on the banks of the Ganges, near the Ghazipur road; it was formerly the residence of the officer in charge of the remount depot, and for several years was occupied by the collector, while the district headquarters were at Korantulih. Four other small bungalows are kept up by the district board, at Rasra, Nagra, Sikandarpur and Siar, the last having been purchased from the railway company and standing close to the Bilhira Road station, about a mile from Ubhaon. In addition to these, the Maharani of Dumnon has a good inspection bungalow at Sonbarsa near Bairin, and small houses at Haldi and Janhi; and one at Garwar belongs to Thakurain Ajodhya Kunwar, whose estate is now under the management of the Court of Wards. At Banadih there are quarters for inspecting officers in the upper storey of the tahsil building, while about a mile distant is a bungalow belonging to the Court of Wards.\n\nA list of all the ferries in the district is given in the appendix. There are at present sixteen ferries over the Ganges, of which twelve are managed by the district board, while the others are private, belonging for the most part to the Dumnon estate. Ten ferries are maintained over the Ghagra, and four of these are private. There is also a district board ferry over the Sarju at Pipra, as well as six private ferries on the same river. The income derived under this head by the district board is considerable: the ferries are leased annually by auction to contractors, either singly or in groups.* In 1905 the Ganges ferries yielded Rs. 14,075, those on the Ghagra, Rs. 5,325, and the Pipra ferry Rs. 275; the average total income for the five preceding years being Rs. 23,360.\n\nBesides the Ganges and Ghagra, the river Sarju is navigable during the rains; but though in former days it carried a considerable volume of trade, the railway has caused the abandonment of the boat traffic, which is now almost negligible. The larger rivers are still utilised to a large extent, though mention\n\n* Appendix, Table XV.\nhas already been made of the marked decline in the popularity of the waterways since the introduction of railway communication. Both the Ganges and Ghagra are practicable for boats of considerable size, and steamers belonging to the Indian Steam Navigation Company ply up and down the rivers, calling in the case of the former at Buxur in Shahabad and Kotwa, the wharf on the opposite bank, and also at Ballia, Baldi, Durjanpur, Nauranga and Dukti; and on the latter at Bilthra, Duha Behra, Qutbganj and Naukagoon. The journey up the Ganges is rendered very difficult for these vessels, which have a carrying capacity of some 300 tons, from February till the rains, as the river is then very low and the numerous shifting sandbanks prove constant obstacles to navigation. The diminution in the volume of the stream by reason of the canals taken from it and its tributaries is very marked, and with a draught of little more than a foot the progress of the steamers is frequently obstructed. The native clinker-built boats are of varying size, the largest carrying about 100 tons, and are propelled as usual by sails and long bamboo sweeps. In addition to the calling-places of the steamers, there are wharves of some importance at Hansnagar on the Ganges, and at Madar and Chand Diara on the northern river. The traffic is registered at Nauranga on the Ganges and at Naukagoon on the Ghagra, but the figures are of slight value as illustrating the trade of this district, as they include the traffic from Ghazipur, Benares, Mirzapur, Fyzabad and other places higher up the streams. The chief articles of commerce on the Ganges are rice, coal and timber from the markets of Bengal, and in the case of the journey down stream they include stone from Mirzapur, saltpetre from Jaunpur, Ghazipur and Ballia, and shira, gram, linseed, sugar, potatoes and fire-wood from this district in particular. These goods are carried to Patna, Murshidabad, Dacca, Palna, Malda and Dinajpur. The returns of the Naukagoon post show that the westward traffic on the Ghagra consists mainly in rice and kerosene oil, and is greatest between February and June; while on the return voyage the boats carry food grains, oil-seeds, sugar, gur and shira from the northern districts of Oudh and the Gorakhpur division, to the great markets of Bengal; the busy season lasting from April to August.\nCHAPTER III.\n\nThe People.\n\nOwing not only to its recent formation, but also to the numerous changes in the area and shape of the district, it is almost impossible to determine with accuracy the population of Ballia from the records of the early enumerations of the inhabitants of these provinces. A further difficulty is caused by the fact that the returns of the first attempts at obtaining a census were notoriously inaccurate. This was especially the case with regard to the census of 1853, which gave a total of 833,308 inhabitants, and an average density of 714 to the square mile. The figure is calculated from the totals of the various parganas of Ghazipur and Azamgarh which go to form the present district, but it necessarily leaves out of account the subsequent interchanges of villages made from time to time with the object of securing a more regular boundary. The manifest incorrectness of the total was displayed at the next census of 1865, which was a far more scientific attempt to obtain an accurate enumeration. The district then contained 667,088 inhabitants, the decrease being no less than 166,280. It was obviously more apparent than real, for no reasons can be adduced for so great a decline, though doubtless some disturbance was caused by the mutiny and the unfavourable nature of the seasons that had immediately preceded the census. On the other hand, it is very possible that there was some understatement of the total on this occasion: in several respects the instructions given to enumerators were defective, and it was well known that in many districts the concealment of females had been practised to a considerable extent. The following enumeration of 1872 showed a population of 719,120 for the district, subject to the reservations made above with regard to subsequent alterations of the boundary, or 726,791, if the population of the additions be calculated on the supposition of even distribution. The increase in the seven years\nwas thus 59,703, and the average density was about 583 to the square mile. This was probably a far closer approximation to the reality than had hitherto been achieved, but none the less the figures were afterwards subjected to the imputation of gross inaccuracy.\n\nThis suspicion was confirmed at the census of 1881, the first to be taken after the entrance of Ballia on a separate existence. The district had not even then assumed its present form, as pargana Garha still belonged to Ghazipur and tapa Dhaka remained in the same district, its amalgamation with Sitamarhi West not taking place till two years later. Allowing for these and other subsequent changes, Ballia contained in 1881 a population of 975,673 persons. The increase was remarkable, amounting to 248,882, while the resultant density per square mile averaged 786 souls; the former was greater than in any other district except Azamgarh, and the latter was only exceeded in Benares, where the abnormal density is due to the small area and the large city population. Some explanation of the increase is afforded by the fact that two-thirds of the gain was on the part of females, suggesting that the practice of concealment had but partially been abandoned at the preceding enumeration.\n\nAt the census of 1891 it was for the first time possible to ascertain the actual population of the existing area, for though pargana Garha was not included in Ballia till the next year and a few villages were transferred after its addition, the records enable us to make the necessary adjustment. The present district had then a population of 905,827 persons, the increment being 10,654. In the absence of unfavourable seasons and epidemics of unusual magnitude, the increase was but small, and it would seem that the pressure on the land had almost reached its limit, for the average density was 798 to the square mile, and though this was exceeded in one or two districts, the mean rate in Ballia was actually the highest attained in the United Provinces after eliminating the urban population. According to the vital statistics the addition during the decade should have been more than 73,000, so that the difference between this figure, though to some extent unreliable, and that of the increase shown by the census can only be attributed to migration.\nThe last census took place in March 1901, and it was then ascertained that the inhabitants of Ballia numbered 987,748 souls, showing a decrease of 7,550 in the preceding ten years. This decline was partly due to an abnormal death-rate caused by fever and cholera in certain years, but, as before, the registers of births and deaths warranted the expectation of a substantial increase, the former exceeding the latter by some 55,000. The mean density per square mile had dropped to 792; this figure being like the others calculated on the present area: higher averages were observed in Benares and Lucknow alone, both small districts with large cities, so that it may safely be asserted that Ballia is by far the most densely populated portion of the provinces, and that the rural rate is probably exceeded in no other part of India.\n\nThe extent to which migration has brought about a decrease in the total population is not easy to determine. The census returns show that on the one hand 94-84 per cent. of the inhabitants were born in Ballia and 5-16 per cent. were natives of adjacent districts or of other parts of India. There had also been a decline in the number of immigrants, for in 1891 the proportion of the people born in Ballia was only 93-2 per cent. of the total. On the other hand, of all the persons enumerated in India who gave Ballia as their birth-place, 88-55 per cent. were found in this district, 2-88 per cent. in other parts of the provinces, and 8-57 per cent. elsewhere. The latter figure is exceptionally high, and the explanation is that, as is also the case in Ghasipur, very great numbers of Ballia labourers resort to the industrial centres of Howrah, Calcutta and elsewhere, while many others frequent the waterways of Bengal and Assam. The whole number of emigrants must have amounted to some 6-8 per cent., after deducting the proportion compensated by immigration, or roughly 62,000 persons\u2014a figure which tallies remarkably with the difference between the actual population and that expected according to the vital statistics. The various districts of Bengal account for the chief share, no fewer than 24,721 natives of Ballia being found in Howrah and Mymensingh alone; while the rest went to different parts of India, especially the Central Provinces and Bombay, where the cotton mills attract.\nnumbers of the Julahas. The census returns necessarily leave out of calculation those emigrants who have gone beyond the confines of India. The total in this case also is considerable, for between 1891 and 1901 as many as 4,288 emigrants were registered, their destination being British Guiana, the West Indies, Mauritius, Fiji and elsewhere.\n\nThough there is no town of any size in the district, the urban population is comparatively large, amounting to 11\u00be per cent. of the whole. In 1901 Ballia contained 1,797 towns and villages, and of this number 1,566 had populations less than one thousand, 157 others less than two thousand, while of the remainder fifty-five possessed between two and five thousand inhabitants, and nineteen more than five thousand. The largest place is Ballia, which contained 15,278 souls, and after this come Sahatwar and Bansdih, with 10,784 and 10,024 respectively. These are followed by Rauna, Baragon, Maniar, Bairia and Icoti; all of which have over 8,000 inhabitants, the other towns being Sikandarpur, Narhi, Bhalsanl and Haldi. Besides these, however, there is a number of large agricultural villages, notably in pargana Doaba and elsewhere along the Ganges, where the changes in the course of the river have resulted in the collection of the inhabitants into a few overgrown sites. The size of the villages in Ballia is indeed remarkable, as they average 491 inhabitants apiece, excluding the towns; while the corresponding figure for Ghazipur is only 339, and the difference is far greater still if the latter be compared with the eastern parganas of this district, the average for Ballia itself being 508, and for Doaba no less than 912. These large communities consist as a rule of a central site with numerous small hamlets. In the west of the district, where the subdivision of land is much closer, most of the villages themselves are but insignificant hamlets composed of an irregular cluster of huts with mud walls and thatched or tiled roofs; resembling those found throughout the Benares and Gorakhpur divisions, and affording a strong contrast to the walled and semi-fortified villages of the upper Doab in Meerut and Agra.\n\nAt the last census the population comprised 473,969 males and 518,700 females, the latter standing to the former in the relation of 108\u00b74 to 100. This preponderance of females is common\nto the Benares and Gorakhpur divisions, and also occurs in the south-east of Oudh. It is nowhere greater than in Ballia, and its existence in a district in which Rajputs are the predominant caste is especially remarkable, not only as disproving the survival of infantoids, but also as showing clearly that it is the result of some unknown natural influence. The phenomenon is common to practically every class and caste, the only exceptions being Kayasthas and Bhangias. It has been ascribed by some to emigration, and this may, and doubtless has, a very marked effect; but it is impossible that this can be the sole factor that distinguishes the eastern portion of the United Provinces from the west. The most remarkable feature of the case in Ballia is that during the fifteen years ending in 1908 male births averaged 17,350 and those of females only 15,700. The recorded deaths for the same period were 15,770 and 14,700 respectively, so that even allowing for emigration it would appear that there should normally be a preponderance of males. That this is not the case is proved by the census figures, which have been approximately identical for the last three enumerations. In 1872, indeed, males predominated, as there were but 91-4 females to every hundred of the opposite sex, but this was almost certainly due to concealment, as already mentioned above. The difference exists irrespective of creed or race, being no less prominent among the Hindus than with the Musalmans.\n\nBallia is essentially a Hindu district. In 1901 the population was made up of 920,667 Hindus, 68,599 Musalmans, 431 Sikhs, 33 Christians, 44 Aryas, and four Jains. Thus Hindus stand to Musalmans in the relation of nearly fourteen to one, the former comprising 93-2 per cent. of the whole, and the latter 6-54 per cent. The proportion of Musalmans has moreover decreased of late years, for in 1881 they numbered 7-5 per cent., and in 1891 only 7-04 per cent.; so that in this district the ordinary rule is reversed. The relatively more rapid increase on the part of the Hindus is a rare phenomenon in these districts, but may be observed to some extent in Ghazipur, and also in the case of old Musalman centres such as Jaunpur, Lucknow and Fyzabad, where the loss of power has resulted in impoverishment and degeneration. Of the other religions there is little to be said.\nThe Arya Samaj has been recently started in Ballia, but is making no progress; and the Sikhs are found in all tahsils, and especially in Ballia, where they are for the most part employed in Government service. Christianity has never made any headway in the district, owing to the absence of systematic mission enterprise; all the Christians were Europeans or Eurasians, with the exception of four natives. There is no church in the district, nor any resident or visiting chaplain. The American Mission has now a small branch at Rasra, with a dispensary in the charge of a lady doctor.\n\nThe majority of the Hindus belong to no definite sect or denomination, though at the same time a larger proportion than usual were returned at the census as followers of a particular school. Thus as many as 93.7 per cent. were classified as members of the various Saivite sects, the great majority being Lingaites, a term which denotes rather the form of worship than any definite sectarian division; 3.1 per cent. as Vaishnavites, mainly Ramanandis and Kabirpanthis; and 0.5 per cent. as worshippers of the Panchon Pir, a heterodox cult which is very prevalent throughout the Benares division. The classification by sects, however, is most unreliable. There is not, for instance, a single entry under the heading of Nath Baba, though this personage is the special saint of the Sangar tribe, and is venerated throughout Lakhnau and in other parts of the district. His principal shrine is at Rasra, and is supported by a voluntary contribution on the part of the Lakhnau zamindars at the rate of one pie in every rupee of the Government demand. The history of Nath Baba is unknown; but it is said that his original name was Amar Singh, and that he lived some two hundred and fifty years ago, and that after twenty-four years of wandering, chiefly in the Punjab, he returned to his own people. The temple at Rasra will be described in the article on that town. What Nath Baba is to the Sangars, so is Bhika Shah to the Kausiks of Kopachit. This man was a resident of Baragaon and flourished some four centuries ago. His tomb and those of his spiritual successors are still standing, and the brotherhood is held in great veneration. There are also numerous establishments of Gosains and Atites in the district, the members of which are the gurus or religious advisers of the lower castes.\nand have to a large extent ousted the Brahmins; though on ceremonial occasions the offices of the Brahman purohit or priest are as indispensable as ever.\n\nThe Hindu community includes representatives of no fewer than 73 different castes, excluding subdivisions, while in the case of 1,778 persons no caste was specified at the last census. A large number of these are very sparsely represented, but in 30 instances the total exceeds 2,000 persons. Among the remainder several deserve notice on account of their comparative rarity in other parts of the provinces, and it is probable that, with the exception of Mirzapur, Ballia presents a greater variety in the composition of its population than any other district. Many of the castes occur almost everywhere and are too well known to call for detailed mention; but some, and pre-eminently the Rajputs, require fuller treatment on account of their preponderance either in the whole district or in one or more of its component parganas.\n\nThe Rajputs take the foremost place, both as regards their aggregate number and their social position. At the last census there were 129,031 members of this caste, including 68,275 females. They thus form 14.02 per cent. of the Hindu population, and are relatively and absolutely more numerous in Ballia than in any other part of the United Provinces, excepting the hill tracts of Kumaun, where the majority of them are Rajputs only in name. Their presence appears to be mainly due to geographical reasons. In every case they claim to be descended from immigrants who came to the district within the historical period, and it would seem that their congregation in Ballia resulted from the pressure exerted upon them by the Musalman invaders from the west, and that they found a fairly secure refuge in this remote corner of Hindostan, which lay off the beaten track of the conquering armies of Islam and provided a sure means of defence in the great rivers that almost surround the district. They are found in great numbers in all the three tahsils, but predominate in Bansdih alone; for though they are most numerous in Ballia, the total is there exceeded by that of Brahmins, while in Rauna the first place in numerical order is taken by Chamars. The Rajputs of the district belong to a great variety of clans, including almost all those enumerated.\nin the census report as well as many others; of the latter no recent figures are available, though they comprise some of the most important local septs, no less than 76,821 members of the caste coming under the heading of \"other clans.\" The leading subdivisions will now be dealt with, as their history and territorial distribution form the most important factors in arriving at a correct idea of the proprietary body.\n\nThe Sengars numbered 10,349 souls, of whom 5,709 were found in the Basra tahsil, 4,023 in Banasth and 617 in Ballia. The total is probably short of the mark, for in 1851 there were 17,189 persons of this clan and 21,189 ten years later; so that it seems that many were entered under other heads. Even so, they are more numerous in Ballia than in any other district, not excepting Etawah, which is the home of the race, though there too they are immigrants, apparently from Jahan, where the head of the family is the Raja of Jagamanpur. The Sengars came to these parts from Phaphund in Etawah, one branch settling in Lakhnesar, almost the whole of which is in their possession, and another in Sikandarpur and the Zaburabad pargana of Ghazipur. In addition to Lakhnesar, they hold large areas of land in Sikandarpur, where they have many settlements, of which the chief is at Pur, and in Kopachit. One branch of the Sengars springs from Bir Sah, a brother of Sur Sah, who founded the Lakhnesar house. His descendants are known as Brahmas, and these numbered 6,502 in 1891, and at the last census were probably kept distinct from the Sengars. Their home is in Sikandarpur, but they also own land in Kopachit and Ballia. The history of the Sengars is closely connected with that of Lakhnesar, and reference may be made to the article on that pargana. As mentioned above, they all worship their tribal saint, Nath Baba, whose principal shrine is at Basra.\n\nThe Karcholias numbered 10,985 souls in 1891, though they are omitted from the list of Rajputs in the report of the last census. They claim to be of Sisodia origin, and in that case are akin to the Gahloti, though only 279 of the latter were enumerated. Their tradition states that certain Sisodias of Chitor settled in the Hamirpur district, and that a branch of that stock migrated to Ballia, receiving the title of Karcholia.\nwhich might be loosely translated as the men of the mailed fist, from some Sultan of Delhi in recognition of their prowess. Their leader was Hem Sah, who lived some eighteen generations ago, and occupied the Kopachit pargana north of the Sarju. This is still far the most part in their possession, the chief talukas being Chilkuhar, Hajauli, and Ratsand.\n\nAt the last census there were 8,043 Bais, of whom 3,803 were found in the Rasra tahsil, 2,132 in Ballia, and 2,113 in Banadih. Like their kinsmen in Ghasipur, they claim to be descended from the Bais of Baiswara in Oudh, but the assertion seems to be without any foundation; they take a somewhat low position among Rajputs, as is the case throughout the eastern districts, and it appears probable that they are of indigenous extraction. Their chief family is that of Nagru in Sikandarpur West, and several offshoots of this house are to be found in this and the eastern parganas of that name. They also hold land in Kopachit East and elsewhere.\n\nThe Donwars are a very numerous clan, having 7,085 representatives in 1891, though they are omitted from the list in the last census. They are of doubtful Rajput descent, and are probably Bhainhars. Their own tradition states that they spring from Mayur Bhat, the founder of the Bians, by one of his many wives, and that they once held a principality in Tirhut. Their principal estates are in the Ballia pargana, comprising the talukas of Middha and Basantpur; the zamindars of the latter place own all the fishing rights in the Suraha Tal, an asset of considerable value. There is also a large colony of Donwars in Alapur Saran of pargana Sikandarpur, and these are connected with the families of Deogaon in the Azamgarh district.\n\nThe Naraini Rajputs do not occur in the census lists of 1891 or 1901, but in 1881 they were shown as having 5,707 representatives. The name is given by Oldham as Naraulia, and is derived by him from Narwal. They themselves claim to be a branch of the Pariharas, of whom 1,169 were separately enumerated at the last census, 716 being found in the Banadih tahsil and 391 in Ballia. The Narains were among the first of the Rajputs to settle in Kharil, where they displaced the Cheros, while another branch occupied part of the Saran district. The former acquired\nthe two tappas of Bansdih and Sukhpura, their chief headquarters being Bansdih itself and Kharauni. They still own some 40,000 acres in Kharid and a small area in Ballia, but much of their old possessions have been lost through mismanagement. They were described by Oldham as inordinately proud, passionate, and extravagant, and these remarks apply with equal force at the present day.\n\nThe Barwars, of whom there were 7,003 in 1891, also belong to pargana Kharid, which they colonised simultaneously with the Narauns. They are said to be Tomars and to have come from Delhi at an early date, first settling in Sagri and Muhammadabad of Azamgarh. There are, however, Bhaiuhars of the same name, and it is possible that both are descended from one stock, though this is vigorously repudiated by the Rajput section. Passing eastward into Ballia, the Barwars took possession of the Majhea and Maniar tappas, most of which they still hold, their chief settlements being at Kaithanli, Barsari and Mundhari. The inhabitants of the two tappas are quite distinct, only eating together on the occasion of some great gathering. There is another branch of the clan in pargana Saidpur of Ghazipur.\n\nThe race of Kinwars is similarly divided into Rajputs and Bhuinbars, the former occupying the Sahatwar tappa in Kharid as well as a large portion of the Chhata and Sariya taluqas in Ballia, while the latter are found chiefly in the Dehna and Muhammadabad parganas of Ghazipur. They do not occur in the list of the last census, but in 1891 there were 5,127 Rajputs of this name in the district. They claim for themselves a Dikhit descent, asserting that they came originally from a place called Padampur in the Deccan; their leaders were two brothers, one of whom entered the service of the Gaharwar Raja of Benares some eight centuries ago, while the other joined the Gautam Bhuinbars and married the Raja's daughter. It is probable, however, that the story was invented to conceal the fact of their Bhuinbar ancestry. They say that Sahatwar was obtained in dower from the Ujjain Raja of Bhojpur in Shahabad, and this statement may very possibly rest on a true foundation. On the other hand, there may be some truth in the alleged Dikhit extraction. At the last census 1,256 members of the latter\nclan were found in the district, almost all of them in the Bansdih tahsil, and especially pargana Sikandarpur East. They are of little importance, except one branch who are known as Pachtorias, from the pargana of Pachotar in Ghazipur. These numbered 1,095 persons in 1891, and are an offshoot of the Ghazipur colony. They hold a considerable area of land in and around Bansdhan in pargana Ballia.\n\nThe Kansika are a clan of Rajputs inhabiting that part of Kopachit which lies to the south of the Sarju. Their numbers at the last census were not specified in the report, but in 1891 there were 4,938 in the district. Their chief settlement is at Baragon, where is the shrine of their special saint, Bhiku Shah. The Kansikas of Ballia claim connection with the Gopalganj family in Gorakhpur, and are said to be a branch of the Sombaras. There are numerous members of the clan in the Azamgarh district, and they are probably derived from the same stock.\n\nThe Baisans are found in all parts of this district, and at the last census numbered 4,957 souls, of whom 2,429 resided in the Rauna tahsil, 1,567 in Ballia and 961 in Bansdih. They are strongest in the north of Kopachit West, where they have considerable possessions, and in Sikandarpur West. They are of no great importance, and like their neighbours in Azamgarh assert that they are of the same family as the Raja of Majhauli in Gorakhpur, the acknowledged head of the clan.\n\nRajputs of the Gautam clan numbered 4,430 persons in 1901, including 2,008 in the Ballia tahsil and 1,584 in Bansdih. They own some 4,000 acres of land in pargana Khariil, but elsewhere their holdings are small. They appear to belong to the same stock as the Gautams of Karanda in Ghazipur, who state that they migrated eastwards some five centuries ago from Argal in Fatehpur, the ancient home of this race. The same story is told by the numerous Gautams in Azamgarh, but its accuracy is open to suspicion; there is a well-known Bhunihar clan of the same name, and it may well be that these Rajputs are of similar, if not identical, origin.\n\nLittle need be said of the Chauhans, of whom 3,437 were enumerated at the last census, 1,917 being found in the Rauna tahsil and 833 in Ballia. They take no high rank and hold but\nlittle land, and are probably quite distinct from the famous clan which predominates in Mainpuri and other parts of the Doab. Similarly the Chandels of this district are held in little estimation, and are almost certainly of local origin. They numbered 3,180 persons at the last census, and of these 2,078 were found in the Ballia tahsil, 679 in Bansdih, and the rest in Rasra. Their chief settlement is at Bijaipur, within the limits of the Ballia municipality.\n\nNo mention is made of the Lohatarias in the report of 1891 or the preceding census, but in 1891 there were 3,742 members of this clan, almost all of them belonging to the Doaba pargana. Nothing is known of their origin, but they appear to have held this part of the country for some considerable time prior to its acquisition by the Raja of Dumraon. They have now lost all their possessions, but retain the lease of many villages, and several of them are persons of wealth and substance. Their chief settlement is Bairia. They are a sturdy and independent race, and at one time they bore an evil reputation on account of their association with the gangs of Dusadh robbers who formerly infested that part of the district.\n\nThe Hayobans or Harihobans are almost peculiar to Ballia and in 1891 numbered 2,571 souls. They rank high among Rajputs and belong to the Lunar race, their head being the Raja of Haldi, the history of whose family will be given later. At one time they held all the parganas of Ballia, but their possessions are now comparatively small. They retain parts of the talukas of Raipur, Jamman and Takarsand, but Haldi, Dighar, Bigahi, Janari, Gaighat, Durjanpur and Gopalganj have been sold, and most of the land is now owned by the Dumraon estate. The Raja has lost practically all his ancestral lands, but certain branches of the house still own a number of villages in Ballia. The Hayobans were the rulers of a large part of Gorakhpur in early days, but the family traditions state that the Rajas came to this district from Bihar to the south of the Ganges in Bengal.\n\nThe Nikumbhis at the last census numbered but 978 persons, of whom 534 were in the Bansdih tahsil and 335 in Ballia; but this appears to be below the mark, as in 1891 no fewer than 3,898 persons of this clan were enumerated. The remainder\nprobably gave some other name, as for example Sirnet, by which\nthe Nikamils are well known in Bana and Gorakhpur. Those in\nthis district maintain the connection with the Sirnets beyond the\nGhagra and are said to be sprung from the younger brother of\nan Unaula Raja. They occupy the tappa of Reoti in pargana\nKhairid, and still own most of the land.\n\nThere are many other Rajput clans found in the district,\nof whom a passing mention will suffice. The Ujjains or Panwars\nare represented by the Danraon house, which holds the largest\nestate in the district, including almost all Donba and the greater\npart of Ballia; and also by the zamindars of Shoopurdar,\nwho come of the same stock. The total does not appear in the\nlast census report, but in 1891 it was 755. The Tetihar, who\nnumbered 2,675 in 1891, are chiefly found in the Ballia and\nDonba parganas, and are more probably Bhuihars than Rajputs.\nSo too are the Anthaians, of whom 2,176 were enumerated in 1891,\nchiefly in pargana Khairid. The Kalkas, 2,508 persons in 1891,\nare also found in Ghazipur, where they have a large settlement\nin pargana Shadabad, and in this district are most numerous\nin Kopachhi West: their traditions are very confused, one account\nmaking them of Bisen origin, while another states that they came\nfrom Aldemau in the Sultanpur district. The Gaharwars num-\nbered 1,834 souls at the last census, 1,858 being in the Bansdih\ntahsil; they are probably connected with those of Mahesh\nin Ghazipur, who assert a descent from the Kantit house in\nMirzapur. Other clans with over one thousand representatives\nare Bachgotia, 1,763, mainly in Rasra; Panwars, 1,703, evenly\ndistributed over the three tahsils; Raghbanshis, 1,507, two-thirds\nresiding in Bansdih; Rathors, 1,225, almost all of whom belong\nto the Ballia tahsil; and Surajbanais, 1,100, in Bansdih and\nBallia, where they hold a portion of taluka Bigahi. Among the\nremainder mention may be made of the Rajkumars or Ram,\nthe Sikarwars of different parts, the Chamfraliansis of Bansdih,\nthe Amethias of Rasra, and the Raikwars of Ballia. None of\nthese are of much importance and their landed interests are small.\nIt is interesting to note that in the case of five clans, Jalawars,\nJatubansis, Bandelas, Jatons, and Gairs, all the representatives\nwere females; this may be due either to faulty enumeration, but\nmore probably the reason is to be found in the marriage customs of the various septs, who generally take wives from particular clans, often going far afield for the purpose.\n\nNext to the Rajputs come Brahmans, of whom there were 117,429 or 12.76 per cent. of the Hindu population. They are most numerous in the Ballia tahsil, where 81,703 were enumerated, or more than was the case with any other caste, and are fewest in Rasra, where the total was but 25,713. The Brahmans of this district belong mainly to the Kanaujia subdivision; but there is a considerable number of Sarwarans and a fair proportion of Sakaldipia. In practically every case they claim to be descended from immigrants, who generally came as family priests of the various Rajput and Bhumihar tribes, from whom they received small grants of land. They own a considerable area chiefly in the shape of small plots, but the proprietary bodies are comparatively few. In the three eastern parganas there is an immense number of Brahmans who hold several villages, not as owners, but under the peculiar under-proprietary tenure known as jamaudh, of which some description will be made later. The Brahmans of this district are for the most part agriculturists, but in that capacity are in no way superior to their fellows elsewhere.\n\nThe third place is taken by the Ahirs, of whom there were 111,000 or 12.06 per cent. of the Hindus. They form the backbone of the agricultural community, being cultivators of a high order, but their landed possessions are small. At one time they owned the town of Ballia and its neighbourhood, which were conferred on them at the permanent settlement, but much of the land has passed to others. Many of the Ballia Ahirs became Musalmans, and are now known as Shoikha, denying their Hindu origin. The Ahirs are most numerous in the Ballia tahsil, in which 44,247 were found, while throughout the rest of the district they are very evenly distributed.\n\nAt the last census there were 89,682 Chamars, constituting 9.74 per cent. of the Hindu population. They are the predominant caste in the Rasra tahsil, in which 42,126 were found, while in Banadil the total was only 18,069. They call for no special mention, being similar to their brethren who abound throughout the provinces; they are generally employed as labourers and\ncultivators, and occupy almost the lowest position in the social scale.\n\nIn this district, as in other parts of the Benares division itself, and in Gorakhpur, the Koeris take the place of the Kachhis and Muras of other parts. They are market gardeners by profession, usually cultivating the richest lands, and growing sugarcane, opium and the more valuable staples. Their total number at the last census was 64,025 or 6.95 per cent. of the Hindus, and this figure was only exceeded in the Gorakhpur and Ghazipur districts. They occur in greatest strength in the Ballia tahsil, but are found in all parts of the district; as a rule, they bear a good reputation, and for the most part are in prosperous circumstances in spite of the high rents they pay for their fields. In a few instances they own land as proprietors, notably in the parganas of Kopachit.\n\nThe Bhars are by common consent an aboriginal tribe, and this caste traditionally hold not only the greater part of this district, but also most of Oudh and the Benares and Gorakhpur divisions. They were displaced by the various invading clans of Rajputs, and were either absorbed or driven eastwards. They are still found in large numbers in the eastern districts, and at the last census Ballia contained 49,600 persons of this race, chiefly in the Bansdih and Rasra tahsils.\n\nBaniyas numbered 42,138 souls, occurring in greater strength than in other districts of the division. They are fairly evenly distributed, though the largest proportion is to be found in the Ballia tahsil. They belong to many subdivisions, but by far the most important is the Kandu, of whom there were 23,068 representatives, a number only exceeded in Gorakhpur. The Kandus rank low among Baniyas, and are chiefly engaged in agriculture and grain-parching, while in Mirzapur many of them are stone-cutters. The other chief clans are Agraharis, chiefly in Rasra; Rauniars, in Ballia and Bansdih; Kasarwans, in all tahsils, but especially Ballia; Kasauadhans, in Rasra and Bansdih; Baranwals, in the same two tahsils; Rustogas, in Ballia and Rasra; and Agarwals in Ballia. Between them they own a considerable amount of land, notably the Agarwals of pargana Deoja, and the Baranwals of Kopachit West and Sihndulapur.\nThe census returns show 31,151 Bhumihars or 3-38 per cent. of the Hindu population. This figure is only surpassed in Gorakhpur, Azamgarh and Ballia, but probably it is less than the reality, as it seems certain that many of the Rajputs should properly come under this category. Two-thirds of them reside in the Ballia tahsil, and the bulk of the remainder in Banadilh. They are commonly supposed to be of indigenous origin and to have intermarried with both Brahmans and Rajputs. In popular estimation they share something of the sanctity which attaches to Brahmans, while, on the other hand, their subdivisions are very often the same as those of well known Rajput clans, such as Gautam, Kausik, Kinwar, Sikarwar and Douwar. At the present time some of them describe themselves as Brahmans and some as Rajputs, but by many they are considered to be a separate race. They are mainly agriculturists, and own large areas of land in most parganas, notably Garha, Kharid and Ballia. Their chief estates are those of the Banwar Bhumihars of Narhi in Garha, the descendants of the famous Dockinandan, now residing in Benares, the Bhumihars of Bairia, and the Tetias of Lilkar, Sinotar and elsewhere in Sikandrarpur East.\n\nAmong the remaining Hindu castes there are but few which call for any special comment. Those occurring in numbers exceeding 10,000 are Kahars, 29,040; Telis, 22,979; Lunias, 22,246; Lohars, 19,818; Kayasthas, 17,029; Dusadhs, 17,354; Mallaks, 15,439; Kurmis, 12,700; Kamkars, 12,298; Nais, 12,162; Kumhars, 11,755; Binds, 10,440; Kalwars, 10,362; and Sonars, 10,254. All of these are sufficiently familiar with one or two exceptions. The Dusadhs are only found in greater numbers in Gorakhpur; they reside for the most part in the eastern parganas, notably Dauha, where they have an evil reputation for crime and lawlessness, though many of them are employed as village watchmen, and their depredations are mainly confined to Bengal. They are mostly ploughmen, labourers, and swineherds, ranking little higher than Chamars: in former days they became notorious for the robberies they perpetrated in conjunction with the Lohatania Rajputs, and not long ago a proposal was made to have them brought under the provisions of the Criminal Tribes Acts, though ultimately the matter was dropped.\nKamkaars belong chiefly to the Ballia tahsil; they are very similar to Kahars, and are employed as cultivators and domestic servants. The caste is confined to a few districts and is only more numerous in Gorakhpur. Binds are another caste confined to the eastern districts, their principal settlements being in Ghazipur. They are found in all parts of Ballia, especially the headquarters tahsil, and are a non-Aryan tribe; their occupations are agriculture and general labour. Next to them come Dhobis, Barnias, Gadariyas, Atits, Barhais, Bazors, Baris and Pasis, their numbers exceeding 2,000 in each case. Atits are more common in Gorakhpur alone; they are rather a religious sect than a caste, and the name is frequently synonymous with Sannyasi. Many of them are cultivators, and in several instances they hold patches of rent-free land. The majority of them are to be found in the Ballia tahsil.\n\nBarais are growers of pan, as opposed to Tambolis, who sell the leaves, though the occupations are seldom kept distinct. Barnias are domestic servants and labourers, their special industry being the manufacture of the leaf-platters used at feasts. Bazors are usually regarded as Doms, and are mostly workers in bamboo, very similar to the Banaphors. They are only found in greater numbers in Gorakhpur and the Bundelkhand districts. Among the minor castes Mahabrahmans, Rangrez and Tiyars are more numerous in Ballia than in any other part of the provinces. The first two are, however, well known and are found in small numbers almost everywhere. The Tiyars, on the other hand, occur in no other district, and here only 135 were enumerated. They are a Dravidian race, akin to Mallahs, being boatmen by profession; the same name is given to a division of the Bhars, and it is possible that this may account for the tradition that a now extinct race of Rajputs named Tiyars once held the Sultanpur district. Other somewhat rare castes found in Ballia are Bayars, of whom there were 515, though this number is largely exceeded in Benares and Mirzapur, a Dravidian tribe of labourers and agriculturists; Soiris, 452, the traditional owners of part of the district in early days, and now a gypsy tribe with vague stories of Rajput origin; and Dubgars, who make the raw-hide vessels in which oil and the like are carried.\nThe Muhammadan population is very evenly distributed, though members of this creed are comparatively somewhat more numerous in the Rasra tahsil than elsewhere, and are relatively fewer in Ballia, where they amount to only 5.7 per cent. of the total number of inhabitants, as compared with 6.6 per cent. in Bansdih and 8.3 per cent. in Rasra. The Musalmans of this district are almost all members of the Sunni sect, which comprised 98.8 per cent. of the community, or all but 687 persons. Of the latter 433 were Shias, and the remainder followers of minor sects. The Shias, moreover, have decreased in numbers of late years, for in 1881 there were 601; practically all the Musalman buildings belong to the Sunnis, but there are few of any architectural importance. The chief are the mosque at Rasra, the minarets of which tower conspicuously above the town, and a pretentious structure erected not long ago at Nawanagar by a wealthy merchant of Sikandarpur. There was a fine old mosque at Ballia, but this was carried away by the incursions of the Ganges in 1874. The Muhammadan population, according to the returns of the last census, was made up of members of forty different tribes and castes, while 207 persons were shown as belonging to no specified division. Of these castes, however, few are of any numerical importance. Only ten occur in strength exceeding one thousand, while twenty had less than one hundred members apiece, and half of these less than ten. Most of the castes have their Hindu counterparts, and consequently call for no further mention.\n\nFirst and foremost come the Julahas or weavers, of whom there were 32,850 or 49.5 per cent. of the whole number of Musalmans. Somewhat over 14,000 of them belong to the Ballia tahsil, about 10,000 to Bansdih, and 8,500 to Rasra. The majority follow their uncestral occupation of weaving country cloth, while in many instances they have betaken themselves to agriculture, being careful and laborious cultivators. Like their kinsmen in Azamgarh and Ghazipur, the Julahas are a turbulent and lawless race, and it is to them that the conflicts between Musalmans and Hindus, which have from time to time disturbed the peace of the eastern districts, may generally be attributed. Closely akin to the Julahas are the Behnas or Dhinas, whose\nprofession is that of cotton-carding. They numbered 3,769 souls, and nearly three-fourths of them belong to the Rasra tahsil. This caste is common to all parts of the United Provinces, and its members are very frequently engaged in cultivation in addition to their hereditary occupation.\n\nSheikhs occupy the second place with 8,258 persons or 12-4 per cent. of the Musalmans. Nearly half of them belong to the Rasra tahsil, while the majority of the remainder is to be found in Banadih. Of the many subdivisions, the Siddiqis are the strongest, numbering 2,519 and being evenly scattered throughout the district, and then come Ansaris with 2,021, and Qurechis with 1,148 representatives. The former are relatively numerous, and three-fourths of them reside in the Rasra tahsil. Others include Usmanis, Farqis, and Abbasis, but very many gave no particular clan, and probably the majority are only Sheikhs in name. They hold a fair proportion of the land, but there are no large proprietors among them, with the single exception of the Phareetar family.\n\nLittle need be said of the Pathans, of whom there were 4,554, the majority residing in the Ballia tahsil. Few of them belong to the better known subdivisions, excepting the Yusufzais and Lodis, who together make up about one-fourth of the total; many describe themselves as Ghaznavis, this appellation being common in Azamgarh and the neighbouring districts. There are one or two old Pathan settlements, but none of any importance. At one time they held the large Sonwani jagir, though this estate was of comparatively recent origin; and at the present time they have several small holdings in Sikandarpur, Kopeshit West, Kharid, and elsewhere.\n\nOmitting the Behnas, of whom mention has been made above, we come next to the Iraqis, of whom there were 2,573, a higher figure than that of any other district. They occur in the Benares, Gorakhpur and Fyzabad divisions alone, and according to their own account are immigrants from Iraq, though in colour and physiognomy they resemble the lower orders of Hindus and are generally believed to be of indigenous origin, akin to Kalwars, the name being derived from army or attack. They are generally shopkeepers and money-lenders, and many of them are in\nprosperous circumstances. About half of them reside in the Rasna tahsil, their chief settlements being in Lakhnear and the two parganas of Sikandarpur. A large property was acquired by Haji Hidayat-ullah of Nawangar, a member of their caste, and is still held by his descendants.\n\nThe remaining Musalman castes which occur in numbers exceeding one thousand are Darzis, 2,448; Rajputs, 1,799; Faqirs, 1,775; Hajjams or Nais, 1,762; and Churiars or makers of glass bangles, 1,065. The Rajputs are mainly converts from the Chauhan clan, and are of little social importance: they occur in all the tahsils, being most numerous in Rasna. Among the other castes the chief are Kunjras or greengrocers, Bhats, Saiyids, Rangrez or dyers, Qasaba or butchers, and Dafalis, who are beggars and musicians of low repute. Among the Saiyids there are one or two families of small local importance, notably the Gardezis of Kot in pargana Sikandarpur East. None of the minor castes deserve mention as being in any way peculiar to this district, with the possible exception of the Saj Gandhis or perfumers, whose home is at Sikandarpur, where they still carry on the business of distilling ite from roses and other flowers.\n\nAs Ballia possesses no towns of any great size, no industrial centres and few manufactures apart from those directly connected with the cultivation of the land, it is only natural to find that the majority of the inhabitants are dependent on agriculture for a means of subsistence. According to the returns of the last census, the agricultural population amounted to 67.3 per cent. of the whole. This includes dependents, but not the large section of the community which follows agriculture as a subsidiary occupation. Of the remainder, 17.33 per cent. represented the industrial classes, half of these being engaged in the supply of articles of food and drink, one-sixth in the manufacture of textile fabrics, one-seventh in metal work and the like, while other well represented occupations included pottery and glass, work in leather and hides, and in wood, cane, and other jungle products. Unskilled labour, other than agricultural, contributed 8.21 per cent.; personal service 3.19 per cent.; commerce, transport and storage 1.72 per cent., the actual commercial population being 8 per cent., or much the same as in Ghazipur, Gorakhpur, and\nAzamgarh; and Government or municipal service 72 per cent. The professional community, a very mixed class, made up one per cent., which is a normal proportion; and the remaining 54 per cent. consisted of those without any regular employment, ranging from persons of independent means to mendicants and convicts.\n\nThe common tongue of the people is the Bihari form of eastern Hindi, and the particular dialect found in Ballia is known as the southern variety of Bhojpuri, itself a subdivision of Bihari. This also is the speech of Ghazipur, while in Gorakhpur to the north we find the northern, and in Azamgarh the western type of Bhojpuri. The distinctions are but small, and the three blend into one another without any clear line of demarcation. The Bihari tongue is directly descended from the ancient Prakrit of Magadha, and is very different from the Hindustani of the western divisions of these provinces, so that the newcomer from Meerut, for instance, experiences great difficulty in understanding the language of the country folk. The returns of the last census show that 99.33 per cent. of the inhabitants spoke Bihari and 51 per cent. Hindustani or Urdu, the latter being used among the Muslims of the towns and the more educated classes. Other forms of speech include English, Bengali, and Punjabi, but these of course were found only among immigrants to the district. Ballia has never been celebrated for the literary attainments of its inhabitants, and its history records no writers of distinction. At the present time the best known name is that of Bakhsh Ram Pande of Haldi, who has written a number of books on various subjects in the Bhasha dialect, while other modern authors are Panch Deo Pande of Rooti, Dush Nath Upaddhya of Hari Chhapra, and Ram Charitra Mira of Bansdih, though none of these have more than local celebrity. There are no newspapers, and the printing press, established at Ballia in 1898 under the name of the Bhiraj Press, has disappeared. A literary and social society was founded at the district headquarters under the name of the Ballia Institute in 1891, with the object of enabling educated men of all denominations to meet on equal terms. The institution for a while flourished, meetings being held regularly twice a month, accompanied by lectures and discussions on matters of\npublic interest. Subsequently however, the membership fell off; interest in its welfare declined, and financial difficulties were encountered. In 1884 the Roberts' Library was founded and attached to the Institute, and in 1904 a new building was erected. A few newspapers are taken in for the use of the members, but meetings are seldom held except for purely business purposes, and few additions have been made to the library since its inauguration.\n\nAn exhaustive account of the land tenures in Ballia would by itself fill a considerable volume, but it may be possible to describe in some measure their general nature and most marked peculiarities within the compass of a few pages. Proprietary rights in the soil are here found in every variety and complication known to the law; and as the revenue law is mainly a reduction of that obtaining in or imposed upon the temporarily settled districts, it often proves a procrastination bed for the actual facts of Ballia. There are tenures and customs that are not fully or explicitly set forth in the law, and at times it is far from easy to determine the particular provision which applies to the special circumstances of a case. Sometimes too the law is quite clear, but is ignored by the customs of the country. The actual statistics of proprietary tenures are therefore to some extent misleading, and at all events they require further explanation in order to make clear the real position. At the present time the district contains 2,525 revenue mauzas or villages, and these are subdivided into no fewer than 9,470 mahals or revenue-paying units, of which all but 35 are permanently settled. Of these 35 temporary mahals 19 are in pargana Kharid, five each in Doaba and Sikandarpur East, four in Garha, and two in Ballia, all of them lying on the banks of the great rivers. Excluding these, and taking the permanent mahals by themselves, we find 1,430 recorded as owned by single proprietors, 3,973 as held in joint zamindari tenure, 1,599 as perfect pattidar, 1,744 as imperfect pattidar and 689 as bhaiyachara. While all these well recognised forms are fully represented, their distribution is very uneven. For instance, all the 537 mahals of pargana Lakhmesar are held in the bhaiyachara form of tenure, which is elsewhere rare, save in Radaon and Garha. Nearly the whole of Doaba is zamindari,\nand only seven pattidarai mahals are there to be found. The latter prevails in Kopachit East, Garha, and Sikandarpur East, but in other parts of the district it occupies a secondary position to joint samindari. The nature and distribution of the different forms result from the history of the various parganas, to which some reference must be made in order to explain their origin.\n\nThe present system is evolved from the loose customs of tribal possession which were in vogue at the time when the province of Benares was taken over from the Oudh Government by the operation of a regular demand for land revenue and the regulation of individual rights in the soil under orderly rule. At first the chief object was to establish the authority of the ruling power and to get as much revenue as possible. The means adopted to secure the latter end varied according to circumstances, but on those circumstances the existing state of affairs almost wholly depends. The conditions of the entire district were in the first instance very similar; the land was occupied in small holding by Rajputs and Banjhars, and the Brahmans who accompanied these tribes when they conquered the country from the low caste aboriginals. They reclaimed and cultivated the land; and to this day they retain their hold upon it in the same degree as formerly, whatever be the nature of their tenure. The latter matters little, and the grip of the Rajput on the land is equally strong, whether he pays rent direct to Government, or to one of the brotherhood that stands between him and the Government, or to the interloping auction-purchaser who bought up the samindari right in the days when a default in paying revenue by the tambadar brought whole taluqas to the hammer, or to the wealthy creditor into whose hands the proprietary right has passed on failure to pay debts contracted either by imprudence or by misfortune, or to the jagirdar to whom the Government interest in the revenue has been assigned. Where the actual proprietary right has passed away, he has none the less managed to maintain his ground as a privileged tenant, and his position in that capacity is often, owing to the inequality of the original permanent settlement, in no way less desirable than that of the small samindar himself. Neither the law nor the landholder can avail to raise the rents of the communities of privileged tenants; for enhancement is useless.\nif the higher rent cannot be collected, and so is ejectment if other tenants cannot gain admission. This dominant fact of cohesion and the stubborn hold of the old cultivators on the land must be always borne in mind in considering the origin of tenures in Ballia; the more so as these factors were in early days of even greater potency than at present, when the idea of individual property in the soil has in some measure weakened the bond of tribal union and obviated the necessity of mutual protection. The forces of collectivism, when it was at its strongest, had to be dealt with in a collective spirit. The permanent settlement was made usually with the landholding clans in their corporate capacity, but in carrying out this policy different methods were adopted in different places. The most characteristic example is that of pargana Lakhnesar, the whole of which was held by Sengars. The owners rose as one man to resist the demands of Raja Balwant Singh, who was compelled to have resort to arms and only captured Rauna after hard fighting in 1784. A compromise was then effected by which the Rajputs engaged for the pargana at a lump sum, which to this day represents the revenue. In 1802 a resettlement was made at the same figure, which was distributed among 35 mahals, but these mahals were not simple aggregates of villages, but a confused intermingling of mohras and portions of mohras to an extent unparalleled elsewhere. They were determined on the basis of tribal subdivision, each mahal consisting of all the land belonging to the descendants of certain families, whether residing together or scattered over the pargana. This confusing system was worse confounded by the absence of any register of proprietors, and also by the local custom of interchanging lands, which has obliterated whatever bond of family union distinguished the original mahals. Such a condition of affairs strains the meaning of bhaiguchari mahal to the utmost: for theoretically it would be quite possible for a single mahal of this nature to consist of portions of land in every village of the pargana. On the other hand, the complication merely results from past attempts to regulate the relations between the landholders and the Government; it has been introduced from without, and the underlying uniformity has been concealed, as in actual practice each individual or small family\nnow cultivates and depends upon certain well-known and defined lands, independently of all complications of manz\u00e1s, mahals and pedigrees. The common land is managed by a few of the leading men of the village, and its proceeds go towards the common expenses for charity, festivals and the payment of the revenue. The name given to the Lakhnusar system is dighadam, each man's holding representing his share, in contrast with the ordinary method of calculating shares in fractions of the rupee on the bigha. The democratic spirit was not so strong in the case of the clans in other parganas. Ballia had its own Raja, and here the problem was quite simple; but the Raja was soon dispossessed, and the tract was then administered by an amil or revenue official. This system was adopted from the first in Kopachit and Kharid. In these parganas the tracts held by each clan had been more or less subdivided by separation of families, each clan having its own tappa and each tappa containing so many taluqas, the latter named in many cases after the chief who founded them. In several instances the division into taluqas was a complete partition by villages; but elsewhere the partition was more complex and consisted in the assignment of some villages in their entirety and some in part. The tenures are as a rule pattidar\u00ed, and in many cases the division of land has been carried out by courts in regular partition; but there is considerable complexity arising from the fact that the taluqas are subdivided into pattis on the khelbat system, which gives every patti a greater or less share not only in every manza but in every quality of soil. In this district the khelbat method of division by fields is invariably adopted in partitions; the sharers always insist on retaining their scattered patches of air land and of having their portion in every description of soil, waste or cultivated, to be found in the mahal. Thus throughout the greater part of the district the name given to the form of tenure matters but little, for every variety took its rise in practically the same manner, the actual form depending on the length of time for which the land has been in the possession of a particular family, and also on the growth of the number of members in the family during that period. The principal exception to this rule is to be found in pargana Doaba, and also in those parts of Ballia,\nGasha, and elsewhere which constitute the property of the Maharaja of Durnraon. This is preserved from subdivision by the law of primogeniture, in accordance with family custom. Much of the estate has been held as hereditary domains for a considerable period, while the rest, including most of the land once owned by the Raja of Haldi, has been acquired by purchase. In this estate, however, the Rajput and Bhanjar tenants take a position very little inferior to that held by actual proprietors elsewhere; they continue in possession on easy terms, paying only the old reasonable rates to which their forefathers consented; they have the same complex division of the tribal area as the samindars in other parts; and they mortgage and sell their lands exactly as they would were their full proprietary right recognised by law. They thus occupy a position very similar to that of sub-settlement holders in Oudh, and are practically on a level with the proprietors in other parts of the district. The original difference lay in the fact that the first engagements in the Durnraon estate were taken from the Raja, whose right was maintained in perpetuity, whereas elsewhere the amil, who made sub-settlements with either the leading men in the various taluqas or with the cultivators themselves in places where there were no families of power or prominence, were only temporary officials. At first, therefore, the distinction between rent and revenue, as now understood, was purely accidental. The persons engaging to pay the government demand to the amil formed a mahal, but a mahal did not constitute a proprietary tenure. The permanent settlement changed all this, for it created for the first time proprietary right in the soil on the part of those engaging; the idea was a new one, and was not readily recognised, as many samindars actually refused to engage, and it was not till 1840 that the practice of farming out such mahals entirely disappeared. The nature of the new right was only grasped thoroughly when the land was sold for arrears. Instead of being a mere farmer as before, the auction purchaser was an actual owner in perpetuity, and this unpleasant discovery was frequently the cause of serious and prolonged conflicts. The uncertainty only terminated with the tardy completion of a record of rights, which should no doubt have been undertaken with the permanent settlement, and in that case would\nhave prevented much of the injustice that afterwards arose from confusion. With this record the natural development of tenures ended, and the only changes that have since taken place have been changes in proprietors, due to sales by private transfer or by publication for debt, and the separation of individual rights owing to private and public partition.\n\nThe retention of their position by the old landowning castes is amply illustrated by the statistics of 1900. Rajputs altogether own 443,760 acres or 53-25 per cent. of the entire district, the number of sharers being no fewer than 183,104. The latter figure is misleading, as it is greater than the total Rajput population, and is due to the fact that frequently the same name occurs over and over again in different mahals. The territorial distribution of the various Rajput clans has already been mentioned. It is for the most part clearly defined, particular clans as a rule holding the whole or portions of the several parganas. Thus in Lakhnesar there are Sengars, in Kopachit Karcholias and Kausiks, in Sikandarpur Bais, Bisens, Barahias and others, in Ballia Hayobans, Denwars, Chauhans, Panwars and Chandels, in Kharid Nikumiks, Narannis and Kinwars, and in Doaba Lohatamias, Chamels, Anthians and Totias. In addition to the land recorded as held by Rajputs in proprietary right, there are also large areas in which they retain their hold on the land as privileged tenants, so that by far the greater part of the district is actually in their possession. Next to the Rajputs come the Bhuihars, who own 86,978 acres or 11-41 per cent. of the district, their largest estates being in Kharid, Sikandarpur and Garha, half the last-mentioned pargana belonging to this caste. Brahmins, who have extensive properties in Sikandarpur West, Kharid and Ballia, own altogether 76,286 acres or ten per cent. of the district, and in addition occupy a considerable area in the eastern parganas under the peculiar tenure known as gurnwada, of which mention will be made later. Next come Kayasthas, with 25,203 acres or 3-31 per cent.; their holdings are distributed over all the parganas, and are proportionately largest in Bhelaon and Kharid. Other Hindu castes own 65,563 or 8-8 per cent.; their number is large, and in no case are their possessions extensive. The remaining 64,186 acres or 8-43 per cent.\nare held by Mussalmans, and the greater portion of this is to be found in the two parganas of Sikandrapur, where was the only Muhammadan settlement of any antiquity.\n\nThe largest estate in the district is that belonging to the family of Dumraon in Shahabad. This is now owned by Maharani Beni Prasad Kunwari, the widow of the late Maharaja Sir Radha Prasad Singh Bahadur, K.C.I.E., who died on the 5th of May 1894. The family belongs to the Ponwar or Ujjain clan of Rajputs, who claim descent from Raja Vikramaditya of Ujjain in Malwa. According to their traditions 67 generations have passed since the days of Vikramaditya, 69 of the family ancestors being rulers of Ujjain. The first of this race to settle in the Bhojpur pargana of Shahabad was Raja Santan Sah, from whom the late Raja was 18th in descent. His successors acquired a large property, including Bibia in Shahabad and practically the whole of pargana Doaba, which formerly belonged to Bengal. To this estate large additions were made by conquest and purchase, including most of the domains once held by the Rajas of Haldi in pargana Ballia, as well as extensive lands in Kharid, Kopachit and Garha. These acquisitions were for the most part effected during the days of Jai Prakash Singh, Maheswar Bahadur Singh and Radha Prasad Singh, the last three owners of Dumraon. The rent-roll of the estate in this district amounts to Rs. 3,68,000.\n\nAmong the leading families of the district the chief is that of the Raja of Haldi, although the property is now quite insignificant. He belongs to the Haribohans or Hayobans clan of Rajputs, a Lunar race, which is said to have come originally from Maheshwari in the valley of the Narbada, the family home being subsequently established at Ratanpur in the Central Provinces. The Ratanpur Rajas were considered the head of the clan till the extinction of the senior line about 150 years ago, since which time the leading place has been taken by the Ballia branch. According to tradition the latter was founded in 850 A.D. by one Chandra Jot, who migrated from Ratanpur to Manjhi on the banks of the Ghagra in the Saran district of Bengal. Here the Hayobans established a large principality by conquest of the aboriginal Cherus. Some two centuries later the descendants of Chandra Jot left Manjhi and took up their abode in Bibia to the\nsouth of the Ganges in Shahabad, where they remained for five centuries. Their departure is alleged to be due to a tragic incident, the story going that about 1528 the head of the clan, Raja Bhupat Deo, or one of his sons, violated a Brahman woman named Mahini, who belonged to the household of the family priest. Mahini is said to have burnt herself to death, and in her dying agony to have cursed the Hayolans race; her tomb still stands near the railway station of Bihia, and to this day is an object of pilgrimage. In consequence of this event the clan crossed the Ganges into the Ballia pargana, at first residing at Gaighat, whence they afterwards moved to Haldi. They held the whole of the pargana under the Mughal emperors, and continued in possession till the days of Balwant Singh of Benares, who deprived the Raja of his estates about the middle of the 18th century. After the expulsion of Raja Chat Singh in 1731, the Raja of Haldi, Bhunbal Deo, obtained a three years' lease of the entire pargana from Mr. Francis Fowke, through the influence of the Benares treasurer, Kashi Mal. In 1786, after expiry of this lease, Mr. Fowke gave a grant to the Raja conferring upon him a perpetual grant of Rs. 16,000 as allowance for pargana Ballia, in acknowledgment of his proprietary right and as compensation for the deprivation of possession. At the permanent settlement five estates with an area of some 16,000 acres were settled with the Raja at a revenue of Rs. 24,105. The annual allowance was confirmed both to Bhunbal Deo and to his son, Tewari Bakhsh, who died in 1806. The title was then passed to his brother, Raja Dalganjan Singh, in whose time the pension was reduced, while in the days of his nephew and successor, Raja Haraknath Singh, who obtained the estate in 1825, it was entirely stopped. Several attempts were afterwards made to procure a renewal of the grant, but without success. Haraknath Singh was afterwards compelled through indebtedness to sell the whole of his estate, which was purchased by the Raja of Dumraon, and his sons, Raja Narasingh Narayan Deo and Raja Sarab Narayan Deo, had no landed property. The latter nevertheless rendered conspicuous service to the British Government during the mutiny, being possessed of great influence in the pargana, whereby he was enabled to assist the district authorities\nin preserving and restoring order. For some unknown reason, however, the promise of a substantial reward was never fulfilled, and all that the Raja received was the grant of two small villages, Udhepura and Murara Patti in pargana Doaba, which had formerly belonged to the notorious rebel Kanwar Singh, a relative of the Maharaja of Durnraon. These villages, which are assessed at Rs. 713, are all that remain to the Raja of Haldi, save for an allowance of 500 bighas from the Durnraon estate at a moderate rent. The present owner of the title is Raja Thakur Prasad Narayan Deo, who succeeded his father, Sarab Narayan Deo in 1861; He is the only hereditary title-holder residing in the district, and his position affords a painful contrast to that held by his ancestors, who were at one time the chief titahari Rajas between Allahabad and Sarno. A complete pedigree of the family is to be found in the Manual of Titles.\n\nIn addition to the Maharani of Durnraon, several of the largest proprietors of this district are non-resident. Among these is the Maharaja of Qasim Bazar in the Murshidabad district of Bengal, who owns 10,988 acres revenue free, comprising the taluqas of Hathauj and Mundiai in pargana Kharid and of Duha-Behra in pargana Sikandarpur. This estate is known as the jagir of Kantu Babu, who was the private secretary of Warren Hastings during the whole period of his administration. The grant was made on the 10th of January 1785 as an altamgha jagir, and was nominally conferred as a provision for religious observances, to be enjoyed by the Diwan and his descendants; it had an estimated value of Rs. 10,000 annually. The grant never received formal sanction, but it was entered by Mr. Duncan in the annual statement of jagir holdings, and for some reason or other escaped resumption under Regulation II of 1819. After the death of Kantu Babu, whose proper name was Kishan Ranth Nandi, the estate passed to his son Raja Loknath, who died leaving a minor son, Raja Harinath Rai, in 1818. During his minority the property was taken under the management of the Calcutta Revenue Board, and given in farm to Mr. Dacosta, an indigo planter in the neighbourhood. The Raja died in 1835, and as his son, Kishannah Rai, was a minor, the property was once more taken under the management of the Revenue Board.\nThe jagir was surveyed in 1841 and was found to contain 9,556 acres, the zamindars for the most part being Rajputs of the Barwar clan. In 1844 Raja Kishannah Rai committed suicide. He left no male issue, and by will alienated his property from his widow, Rani Saranmai. The will was contested and property was taken under the Court of Wards, but subsequently the deed was pronounced invalid, and orders were issued for placing the widow in possession. At the same time the Local Government ordered the jagir to be attached with a view to its assessment to land revenue; but this was contested by the owner, who in 1860 obtained a decree establishing her right. The Rani died in 1897, and her property passed to her mother-in-law, Rani Hari Sundari, the widow of Raja Harimath Rai, who bequeathed it by will to her grandson, Maharaja Munendra Chandra Nandi Bahadur of Qasim Bazar. The latter was the son of Raja Kishannah Rai's sister, and therefore the prospective heir of the Rani Hari Sundari. The Maharaja is not only the jagirdar but also the actual zamindar of the Mundari and Hathauj taluks, as the interest of the former proprietors was sold up for arrears of revenue and purchased by Rani Saranmai in 1871 and 1874. The old zamindars of Mundari continued as occupancy tenants, and those of Hathauj as ex-proprietary tenants of their former sir lands.\n\nA second revenue-free estate is that known as the Sonwani jagir, which comprises 14 villages in pargana Ballia, with an area of 0.962 acres. This estate also owed its origin to Warren Hastings, and was conferred by him on his Mir Munshi, Shariatullah Khan, a member of a noble Musalman family of Burdwan in Bengal. On his departure from India, Warren Hastings made this grant, which had an estimated annual value of Rs. 8,000, on Shariatullah \"in recognition of his zeal, meritorious conduct, and long standing in the service.\" He died about 1790, after having greatly improved the estate by careful management, making a settlement with the actual cultivators instead of the village owners, who were allowed to hold the fields in their own cultivation at very low rents. His success may be estimated by the fact that the collections amounted to no less than Rs. 31,500 per annum. Shariatullah left two\nwidows, Talaman and Jugna, the former having a son named Ghulam Khan, and the latter a daughter Hasina. Ghulam Khan entered into possession of the taluq, and so remained till his death in 1811. He left a widow, Manji Bibi, but no issue; and disputes as to succession arose; a compromise was eventually adopted by which Talaman received four and a half annas, Manji three and a half annas, Jugna three and Hasina five annas. The last mentioned in 1812 married Tasadduq Hussain, the sarifshadar of the magistrate's court of Jaunpur and by him she had a daughter, Masuma. Three years after Tasadduq Hussain's death in 1824, Hasina married a relative of her first husband named Jalal Bakhsh, then a clerk in the Jaunpur civil court. In the same year Manji Bibi died, and this was followed by a long course of litigation. The brother of Manji claimed her share of the property, but the suit was finally rejected in 1835. Another quarrel broke out between the three women, and this was settled in 1836 by a deed of compromise, by which Hasina and Masuma were each to have seven annas, and Jugna to have the remaining two annas for life, her share reverting to Hasina in 1851. Several other suits followed, arising from the fact that in 1853 Hasina had executed a deed conveying all her share to her husband, and when on the strength of this deed Jalal Bakhsh obtained a decree for possession, his right was disputed by Masuma. The latter failed in her attempt, but at the same time the court had ruled that as the jagir was originally bestowed on Shariat-ullah and his male heirs alone, Hasina had only a life interest in the grant. During the mutiny the two Begams exerted their influence in the service of Government, and their loyalty was officially recognised; but in 1859 the taluq was attached in the same manner as that of the Kantu Bahu. The owners, however, recovered their property on appeal, but before the decree was granted Hasina died. This event resulted in a suit brought by Masuma Begum against Jalal Bakhsh on account of her mother's dower and her share in the personal property; and this was eventually successful, the result being that Jalal Bakhsh's share was sold up and bought by Masuma Begum, who thus acquired the entire estate. The property, which had hitherto been well managed, now became\nheavily embarrassed, and in 1869 it was taken under the management of the Court of Wards. The debts proved too large, however, and it was then too late to save the situation. The Begum and her grandson, Ahmad Hussain Khan, put every obstacle in the way of the Court of Wards, and eventually in 1884 the entire property was sold for Rs. 5,75,000 to the Maharaja of Vizianagram, who has large estates in other parts of the Benares division.\n\nAnother estate which traces its origin to the early days of British rule was that acquired by the notorious Bhumihar amil, Deokinandan Singh, and his son, Jauki Prasad. These men obtained possession of an immense amount of land in the districts of Ghasipur, Ballia, Gorakhpur and Allahabad during the time that they were in office, by means of force, elicitation, mortgages and fraudulent auction sales at absurdly low prices. These proceedings lasted from 1798 till 1805, during which period Deokinandan practically assumed the entire charge of the province. An enquiry was eventually held, and both the amil and the collector were dismissed. In only a few cases, however, were the villages restored to the owners, and the descendants of Deokinandan remained in possession of their ill-gotten property. In the case of this district the estate comprises land assessed at Rs. 23,060, with a rent roll of about Rs. 42,000, in the parganas of Ballia, Kharid and Kopachit East and West. Deokinandan's son, Janki Prasad, died in 1832, leaving two sons, Ram Ratan Singh and Ram Parsan Singh. The latter died without issue in 1854, but his property continued to be held by his widow till 1880. Ram Ratan Singh, who died in 1848, left two sons, Har Shankar Prasad Singh and Gaari Shankar Prasad Singh. The former became heavily indebted, and his property has been sold up; the share in the Ballia district was purchased by his brother, who was for a time under the guardianship of the widow of Ram Parsan Singh, while since her death it has been managed by the Court of Wards in Ghasipur. The owner is a lunatic and childless; he resides in Benares.\n\nThe Pandes of Bairia belong to a Bhumihar family which owes its advancement to the Rajas of Durnraon. They originally came from the village of Sihori in Ghasipur, and in the days of Raja Chet Singh, of Benares, one Jagdeo Rai came to Bairia,\nwhere his grandson, Puran Pande, succeeded in procuring for Raja Bikramajit of Dumraon the settlement of Doaba. He then became manager of the estate, and subsequently was given a large property by the Raja, which still remains in the possession of his descendants. The latter continued to manage the pargana, and at the same time increased their wealth by taking leases of several villages. During the mutiny Raghunandan Pande did good service by preventing the inhabitants of Doaba from joining in the rebellion, by supplying the British forces with provisions and forage, and by taking active steps to drive the rebels out of his part of the country. The property was subsequently divided, the chief shares falling to Raghunandan and to his cousins, Radha Madho Prasad and Radha Mohan Prasad. The former is still alive, while the latter's share is held by his widow. Raghunandan left a son, Padam Deo Narayan Pande, an honorary magistrate, who still holds a fair estate, though it is very heavily indebted. Altogether the Pandes own some 7,000 acres in Ballia, Kharid, and Doaba, paying about Rs. 10,000 revenue, while they also possess considerable areas in Ghazipur and Shahabad.\n\nA prominent position among the landowners of this district is taken by the Hon'ble Munshi Madho Lal of Benares, whose inherited and acquired estates are assessed at Rs. 20,520. He belongs to an ancient family of Sipahi Nagar Brahmans, and for several generations his ancestors held high posts in government service. The bulk of the property in this district was acquired by Lachhmi Lal, who was Government pleader in Benares and died without issue. His estates passed to his nephew, Munshi Beni Lal, who was a munshi in Ballia and Benares, and who left two sons, Sadho Lal and Madho Lal, of whom the latter succeeded his brother as head of the family. The property consists for the most part of the talugas of Ser in pargana Ballia and Kop in pargana Sikandarpur, to which large additions have been made by purchase.\n\nThe other landowners of the district call for no detailed mention, and it is sufficient to give a brief enumeration of the proprietors of the largest estates. The majority are Rajputs of different clans, and their property is in most cases of old\nstanding. Among the most prominent are Babu Bans Bahadur Singh, the head of the Bais family of Nagra, whose estate, now managed by the Court of Wards, lies in the two parganas of Sikandarpur and is still of considerable extent, though much less than that held by his ancestors; the Narainis of Bandi, represented by Babu Bisheshwar Gajadhar Prasad Narayan Singh and Babu Gobind Prasad Singh, each of whom has extended his possessions of late years; the Karcholis of Kopachit, including Babu Mahaloo Prasad Singh of Chilkaheer, Babu Har Charan Singh of Hajauli, and Babu Raj Kishor Singh of Ratanud; the Sengar zamindar of Pur, Babu Mahabir Singh; the Kinwars of Sahatwar, of whom the chief are Babu Sat Narayan Singh and Babu Bisheshwar Kunwar, an honorary magistrate; Babu Bans Bahadur Singh, the Hayobans owner of Takarsand; and the Barwars of Jagirsand and Muniar, the former being owned by Babu Sarju Prasad Singh, and the latter being represented Babu Mahabir Singh. These persons are in most cases the leading representatives of their clan, and their estates usually constitute but a portion of the ancestral holdings of the family, the tribal area, as already mentioned, being subdivided among a large community. Of the Banias the chief are the Baranwals of Rasra, at the head of whom is Babu Basdeo Prasad, who has lands in Lakhnesar, Kopachit West, Khari and Ballia, in addition to branch banking establishments in Calcutta, Benares and Mirzapur; and the Kasuls of Hanumanganj, whose property has been acquired by purchase from the proceeds of a flourishing business in sugar. Among the Musalmans are Sheikh Abdul Ahad of Pharsatar, the largest landowner of this creed in the district, whose estate was first obtained by an Ansari Sheikh named Baha-ud-din in reward for military services during the reign of Aurangzeb, then lost to the Bais of Nagra, and finally regained by Sheikh Khadim Ali, a successful and popular pleader in Ghazipur; and Maulvi Muhammad Sharif of Kataila in Ghazipur, who is a leading wazir at Ballia. Mention may also be made of Babu Raijnat Saran, a Pandu Brahman, who has acquired much of the Reoti estate, and of the Bhunhars of Nashi in pargana Garha, an old family of the Banwar clan, at the head of which are Babu Parmanand and his brother, Babu Sham.\nNarayan. Mention may also be made of Raja Brij Narayan of Padrauna in Gorakhpur, who in 1905 purchased land assessed at Rs. 3,200 in the Rasna tahsil.\n\nMidway between the zamindars and the tenants comes a small class of under-proprietors. Their holdings, which in this district are not extensive, are for the most part of the description known as ganwaddh. The persons in enjoyment of this right are mainly Brahmans, who obtained grants of whole villages or portions of villages from the Rajput overlords, at a lump rent for the entire area or else at a low fixed rate per bigha, on consideration of a small sum paid down, under the name of nasavada, at the time of the gift. These grants, which are both hereditable and transferable, are peculiar to parganas Ballia and Kharid, and generally date from a period slightly antecedent to the permanent settlement. In the former pargana, where the Rajput dominion had been broken, separate settlements of their villages were usually made with the Brahmans, who thus became the actual zamindars; but elsewhere the ganwaddhdars were recognised as occupying a special position. Sometimes they are jointly responsible for the revenue demand, and sometimes the land has been divided, each ganwaddhdar paying his share separately without reference to the others and having no joint liability. The area thus held amounts to 12,638 acres in Kharid, 7,700 acres in Ballia, 571 acres in Kopachit West, and 456 acres in Kopachit East; the average rate paid is Re. 1-12-10 per acre.\n\nPractically indistinguishable is the tenure known as istimrari or mushakhi, which is a perpetual lease, either granted in the same way, or given to new settlers who undertook to bring waste land under cultivation. Other subordinate rights extend only to small plots, the owners of which are termed arazidars, and derive their title either from grants made by former rulers or individuals of note in rent-free tenure, or else from gifts or by purchase from the zamindars. In some of these the land has been assessed to revenue, which is paid through the lambardar, or else directly to Government, as is the case when rent-free tenure for fifty years has engendered proprietary right.\n\nThe origin of the existing cultivating tenures is in some respects similar to that of zamindari interest in the soil, and\nSome explanation is necessary to show how the various classes of tenants came into existence in this district. Before the introduction of the permanent settlement there was really no distinction between rent and revenue in the modern sense of the terms, save in so far as the latter represented the sum paid by the amils or contractors to the central government, and the former that paid to these officials by those in possession of the land. This amount was calculated from what was in actual practice a ryotwari assessment of all cultivated land; the private holdings of the zamindars were treated more leniently than the rest, and this was the origin of sir. The payments to the amils were obtained either from a general rate per bigha or else by appraisement of the standing crop, though in many instances resort was had to an actual division after harvest. The rates per bigha had a natural tendency to become permanent, owing to the unwillingness of the people to submit to an enhancement and the impossibility of collecting an increased demand. The amount fixed between the amil and the zamindar as the sub-settlement was invariably less than the sum due to Government, and generally less than the amount actually received by the revenue collector. This difference between the assessment at acknowledged rates and the sum paid to the amil constituted the zamindar's profit, to which must be added the benefit derived from the lower revenue rate on sir lands. The cultivator paid what was supposed to represent half the produce, whether the amil got the whole or not. Consequently these revenue rates, which were determined for each pargana, were the original rent rates; by custom they became fixed, and tenants whose rents have or can be assumed to have remained constant since the permanent settlement are the tenants at fixed rates, and for all practical purposes are equivalent to proprietors. Their rights were in no way barred by the fact that higher rates were paid for such crops, such as sugarcane, tobacco, opium, and vegetables. Thus in pargana Kharid the established rate for ordinary cereals was Rs. 1-12-0 per bigha, plus nine annas as cesses, and for special crops Rs. 7 per bigha. This practice still holds in several parts of the district, and at the present day the rate for sugarcane in Kharid and Kopachit is three times\nthe ordinary rental for similar land otherwise cultivated. In spite of the assumed fixity of the rates the amils not unnaturally attempted to obtain enhancements, and for this purpose resorted to fraudulent devices, such as the imposition of additional cesses and the employment of a shorter measure of length. Another common abuse was the insisting on payment in kind in good years and in cash when the outturn was poor; but as a matter of fact rents in kind were favoured by the cultivators, who are more than a match for the officials in the matter of appraisement, and whatever system was adopted it seems certain that the full half value was never paid in reality. These abuses were checked, if not stopped altogether, by Duncan, who introduced a standard bigha, prohibited new cesses, adopted as standard rates those accepted for 1187 Fasli, encouraged the practice of paying rents in cash at the established rates, and forbade an actual division of the crop, substituting for it appraisement before harvest, together with a scale of rates published each year before the crop was ripe, according to which the amount determined by appraisement was to be commuted to cash.\n\nThe first legislation undertaken on behalf of the tenants was the provision in Regulation LI of 1795 for the issue of pattas or leases to cultivators by the zamindars fixing the rent due, the rate to be determined by rules established in the pargana, tappa, or taluqa for similar lands. To the same date may be assigned the origin of occupancy rights; for it was laid down that khudkasht, or as they are now called maurusti, tenants could not be ejected so long as they paid the stipulated rent, and only paikash tenants or tenants-at-will could be removed from their holdings on the expiry of the lease. A result of this enactment was that occupancy rates were fixed for ever, so that this class of holding became for practical purposes identical with that of tenants at fixed rates. In other respects the regulation proved of little effect, for owing to the ignorance of the cultivators very few leases were granted, though in spite of this the enhancements appear to have been very small. At the preparation of records of rights in 1840 all the fixed-rate tenants were definitely recorded, and at the revision of 1882 all holdings were so entered which had been received by descent or transfer from the maurusti.\ntenants of 1840, provided no enhancement had taken place in the meantime. An innovation was introduced with Act X of 1859, which invented the occupancy tenant of twelve years' standing. Their rents were determined at \"fair and equitable\" or \"prevailing\" rates, these being somewhat higher than the old fixed rates, as among other circumstances the increased value of produce was taken into consideration, though this was merely a present to the zamindars. The effect was, however, small owing to the large area under fixed rates, and it gave occupancy rights to a limited class. Not only was it impossible to prove a general enhancement, but an increased rent could not be collected. Enhancements were for the most part confined to the pattidari estates, where they were obtained by pressure and by ejectment for arrears. In such villages the tenants proper were not strong enough to prevent the intrusion of newcomers, while the owners always had the alternative of taking the land into their own cultivation if the old tenant refused to submit. Another reason for the same effect of the legislation of 1859 was that it was not followed by any record-of-rights defining the possession of tenants, and the absence of this record tended to discourage attempts at enhancement; for every tenant claimed to hold at fixed rates, and this contention had to be disproved before any further steps could be taken. Of more importance was the introduction of Act XVIII of 1873, which materially altered the status of simple occupancy tenants by making their rights non-transferable and limiting the succession of inheritance. However well suited these provisions were for temporarily settled districts, they here proved an undoubted hardship. Hitherto the tenants had shared with the zamindars in the benefits of the permanent settlement; they could do what they liked with their land, and the sale of tenant rights frequently fetched as much as Rs. 200 per acre. The abolition of this privilege in the case of a certain class resulted in the practical disappearance of their credit, and placed the simple occupancy tenant in a position widely different from that of the tenant at fixed rates. The same Act created a new class of tenants in the shape of ex-proprietary holders of air land; but the result was insignificant, as the area thus held is very small.\nThe history of the district in this connection is reflected by the condition of affairs prevailing at the present time. Of the total cultivated area 27-77 per cent. is in the hands of the proprietors themselves, either as sir or khudkhasht. The proportion is highest in the pargana of Lakhnesar, Bhadaon and Garha, in each of which it amounts to nearly 50 per cent. In Lakhnesar practically all the land would be sir if the local distribution were compact; but the different holdings are scattered in the most complicated manner, and a zamindar perforce cannot cultivate all his land himself. This does not imply that all the sir land is in the actual cultivation of the owner, although it had its origin in that way and the greater part still retains its old character; the rest is filled by sub-tenants, who are very numerous in this district. The proportion is also high in the two parganas of Kopachit and Kharid, where it amounts to about one-third of the whole. There the territorial distribution of the Rajput clans is fairly clearly defined, although all the members are not zamindars, some being only cultivators who have lost or never possessed proprietary right, while one or two large estates have gone into the hands of auction-purchasers. In the two parganas of Sikandarpur the proprietary area closely approximates to the district average, but in Ballia only 22 per cent. of the land is so held and in Doaba not more than 3 per cent., the latter figure being due to the peculiar circumstances of that pargana, which practically forms a single zamindari holding. The old fixed rate tenants hold 19-31 per cent. of the entire district, the proportion ranging from 38 per cent. in Ballia, 33 in Doaba and 27 in Sikandarpur East, to nothing in Lakhnesar and very little in Kopachit, Garha and Bhadaon. Their position in Kopachit is due to the action of the zamindars, who were particularly fortunate in their attempts to raise the rates in early days; while the high proportion in Ballia results from the extinction of the Rajput dominion before the introduction of the permanent settlement, the same remark applying to Doaba. Occupancy tenants account for 31-34 per cent, the area being very evenly distributed throughout all parganas of the district. In many cases they are also zamindars, especially in pargana Lakhnesar, where their status resulted from the introduction of Act X of 1859.\nAs already mentioned, the ex-proprietary area is small, amounting to 75 per cent., and more than half of this is to be found in the Bansdih tahsil. The rent-free or muajj lands contribute a further 19 per cent., and are most extensive in the parganas of Kharid and Ballia. The remaining 18-85 per cent. is held by tenants-at-will without rights of occupancy. In some parganas, such as Doaba and Sikandarpur West, the proportion is much higher, and in the former at any rate, as in several other parts, the presence of this class of tenants is mainly due to changes caused by alluvion and diluvion, while as far as possible the Dunraon estate prevents the acquisition of new occupancy right by the grant of leases. The general result is a state of affairs which has no parallel in any district of the provinces, for nowhere do privileged tenants comprise so great a proportion of the total area or hold at such lenient rates. This phenomenon is due in the first place to the benefits of the permanent settlement, and secondly, though almost to the same extent, to the tenacious and independent character of the cultivators themselves.\n\nThe figures given above do not take into account the area held by shikmis or sub-tenants. This amounted in 1905 to 26 per cent. of the whole district, the proportion being highest in the Bansdih tahsil, where it amounts to 34 per cent., and lowest in Ballia, where it is no more than 20 per cent., while in Rasra it corresponds exactly to the general average. There are no separate figures to show the area of such holdings in the lands recorded under the various classes of tenancy. The shikmi naturally pays a very high rent, as he does not enjoy privileged rates, like the occupancy tenant, and as he usually cultivates the best land in the village, whether it be air or the holding of a fixed-rate or occupancy tenant. The tenant at will, on the other hand, has generally to be content with the worst lands, in which no rights have accrued.\n\nEver since the permanent settlement the great bulk of the rents in this district had been paid in cash. The conversion of grain rents was one of the special objects aimed at by Duncan at the time the settlement was made, and in fact those who continued to pay grain rents were afterwards penalised by being deprived from the privileges of a fixed rate tenancy. At the\npresent time the area in which rents are paid in kind amounts to 16,478 acres or 2-05 per cent. of the entire cultivation, and with few exceptions it is composed of rice land of a more or less precarious character, in which the produce is always uncertain. More than one-third of this land lies in pargana Sikandarpur West, and the bulk of the remainder in Kharid, Ballia and Kopachit West. Sometimes too the practice of taking rents in kind prevails in the newly formed alluvial areas along the Ganges. The rent is usually estimated at half the produce, and is either calculated by appraisement just before harvest, or else is paid by an actual division of the crop. It is a common practice to add something to the landlord's share on account of cesses, and these extra payments are locally known as serahi and pachua or neg, varying from two to five sars per maund of the whole estimated outturn.\n\nFrom the foregoing accounts of the cultivating tenures it will be evident that the cash rentals afford no index of the fertility of the land, nor indeed of the relative capacities of the various parganas. Nearly all the good land is held either as sir, or by fixed rate or occupancy, so that the rents paid by tenants-at-will are necessarily low. A truer idea is obtained by an examination of the rents of sub-tenants, these being fixed by competition and not by custom. This is also the case in pargana Lakinesar, which has the highest rent rate in the district, although possessing decidedly the least fertile soil. There the occupancy rights were only acquired under Act X of 1859, the whole of the land being formerly considered as sir, the outlying portions of which were leased by one zamindar to another at a comparatively light rate. In Kopachit and Kharid the average rates are nearly identical, but relatively to fertility rents are much higher in the former pargana, where the tenants have had a good deal of enhancement forced upon them and are not so well off as their neighbours. The returns of 1905 show that for the whole district the average rent paid by tenants at fixed rates was Rs. 3-13-2 per acre, ranging from Rs. 4-10-1 in Donba to Rs. 2-15-0 in Kopachit West; the average for the Ballia tahsil was Rs. 4-4-8 and for the rest of the district Rs. 3-4-0 per acre. Occupancy tenants paid Rs. 4-1-10, the Ballia tahsil again coming\nfirst with Rs. 4-7-3, after which comes Rasra with Rs. 4-0-7 and Bansdih with Rs. 3-11-11. The rates for tenants-at-will were practically the same, the only marked excess being found in the Ballia tahsil, where they averaged Rs. 4-10-7, while in Bansdih they were actually lower than the privilege rate, for the reason given above. The rate for sub-tenants, which more closely approximate to a true competition rental, was Rs. 7-2-6 per acre for the whole district, Rs. 10-15-7 in the Ballia tahsil; Rs. 6-1-7 in Rasra and Rs. 5-2-2 in Bansdih. These rates are not entirely accurate, for in the first place many holdings include non-rented areas, while secondly the recorded rents cannot be considered altogether reliable, especially in the case of non-occupancy tenants.\n\nAt the same time it is certain that there has been a considerable rise in the shikari rents during late years, and also in the general rent-rate of certain tracts where, owing to special causes, the pressure on the land has increased, or its value has been enhanced on account of improved communications and other reasons. Occupancy rates are still very moderate and are seldom enhanced; and as they apply to the greater part of the district the rental may be considered as very light indeed, compared with what is paid for similar land in temporarily settled tracts. Theoretically caste privilege is not recognised, but as a matter of practice cultivators of the lower castes almost invariably pay higher rents than the Brahmans and Rajputs. This results rather from their social position than from a recognition of their superior capacity, although Koeris and other tenants of the market-gardening class always pay the highest rents.\n\nMention has been made of the old custom whereby special rates were paid for sugarcane and other valuable crops in old days. At the present time it has died out in the parganas of Lakhnesar, Deaha, Garha, and Ballia, excepting two villages, but elsewhere it survives to a varying extent. In Kopachit the practice is almost universal to this day, but in the other parganas it is confined to a few villages. This custom applies only to sugarcane nowadays, and is known as the beshhi wak. In Kopachit East the rate for sugarcane land ranges from Rs. 5 to Rs. 8 per acre when the field has lain fallow in the previous year, while otherwise the recorded rent is first deducted. In pargana\nSikandarpur the same alternative system is to be found, the rate in the former case ranging up to Rs. 10-10-0, and in the latter from Rs. 4-12-0 to Rs. 8. In pargana Kharid the custom varies in different villages. Ordinarily, as in other parts of the district, the special rates have been fixed irrespective of a consideration for a previous fallow year, and vary from Rs. 3 to Rs. 7; but in Maniar, Balupur, and a few other villages bakhulh consists in an addition to the recognised rent, at a rate varying from Rs. 1 to Rs. 3.\n\nNo detailed records are available to show the actual area cultivated by the different castes. At the last revision of records such a return was prepared, but only for pargana Kharid. It is estimated, however, that Rajputs hold some 30 per cent., Brahmins 23 per cent., Bhumhars, Koors, and Ahirs 10 per cent. each, while the remainder is tilled by other castes. The territorial distribution has been dealt with in the preceding pages of this chapter. The Rajputs, who are spread over the whole district, are strongest in Doaba and Lakhnesar, where more than half the soil is in their hands, and weakest in Ballia and Garha. Brahmins also are found everywhere, the proportion being lowest in Doaba. Bhumhars predominate in Garha, but have little hold in other parts of the district; and the Ahirs and Koors have no especial predominance in any single pargana. The high caste tenants seldom do the actual cultivation themselves, generally sub-leasing their lands; but they get less out of the soil, whether they sub-let it or cultivate it themselves or employ hired labour, than do the Koors and Kurmis.\n\nThe lightness of the revenue demand, and still more the low average of the rental, combined with a comparative immunity from famines and other seasonal calamities, tend to render the condition of both proprietors and tenants in Ballia far more desirable than is the case in less fortunately situated tracts. None the less, a light assessment has never proved a bar to extravagance and mismanagement, and there is no reason for believing that indebtedness is less common than in the temporarily settled tracts. The Rajputs and Brahmins of Ballia follow the universal rule of their castes in spending on marriages, funerals and other ceremonies sums which are far beyond their means;\nand as they benefit from the permanent settlement to a larger extent than others, it follows that the rest of the population are little better off than elsewhere. The agricultural community are, however, in a generally satisfactory condition, and have profited much by the rise in prices. Sales are not frequent, and when they occur, the land is usually purchased by more prosperous and careful members of the same community. The money-lending classes have made some headway of late, but in many instances they are represented by the high caste zamindars. The labouring castes too have materially improved their standard of comfort since the formation of the district, and large sums are annually remitted to Ballin by those who have left their homes temporarily to seek service elsewhere.\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nADMINISTRATION AND REVENUE.\n\nThe district is in the charge of a Magistrate and Collector who is subject to the control of the Commissioner of Benares. The sanctioned magisterial and revenue staff consists of three deputy magistrates and collectors with first-class powers, one with powers of the second class, and the three tahsildars, each of whom exercises criminal and revenue powers of the third and second classes respectively. At the present time there are five honorary magistrates, of whom Babu Bisheshwar Kunwar of Sabatwar has third-class powers within the limits of the Bansdih police circle, Babu Padam Deo Narayan Singh of Bairia has similar powers in Bairia and Reoti, Babu Ram Parkash Singh in thana Nagro, Babu Rajendra Partab Narayan Singh in thana Haldi, and Maulvi Abul Baka in the Sikandarpur circle. For the purposes of civil jurisdiction the district is included in the judgeship of Ghazipur, subordinate to whom are the munsifs of Ballia and Rasra, between whom the area is divided, with the exception of pargana Garha, which is administered by the munsif of Mohammadabad in Ghazipur. The circle of the Ballia munsif comprises the parganas of Ballia, Doaba and Kharid; and that of Rasra the rest of the district, excluding Garha. There are also two honorary munsifs: Babu Gobind Prasad Narayan Singh for Kharid and Sheikh Abdul Ahad of Pharsatar for Sikandarpur West and Bhadoon. The experiment of village munsifs has not yet been attempted. Criminal appeals and sessions work are entrusted to the judge of Ghazipur. The remaining official staff consists of the superintendent of police, the civil surgeon and an assistant surgeon in charge of the Ballia dispensary, the district surveyor, an assistant opium agent, the postmaster and the headmaster of the high school.\n\nAs at present constituted Ballia is divided into three tahsils and ten parganas. The latter are of little use for practical purposes, and as in Gorakhpur and Basti, they have in some\ninstances been divided between different tahsils, in order to secure a more convenient arrangement of administrative subdivisions. The Ballia tahsil comprises the four parganas of Ballia, Doaba, Kopachit East and Garha. The Rasra tahsil also has four parganas, Lakhnesar, Kopachit West, Sikandarpur West and Bhadaon; and the Bansdih tahsil includes Kharid and Sikandarpur East. Some of the parganas are subdivided into tappas or into taluqas or into both. These are usually held jointly by large Rajput communities; and as late as the permanent settlement the entire pargana of Lakhnesar formed a single mahal.\n\nBallia is one of the youngest of the districts of the United Provinces, as it did not enter upon a separate existence till 1879. When the Nawab Wasir of Oudh made a formal cession of the sovereignty of the Province of Benares to the East India Company in 1775, the tract was included in the zamindari of the Benares Raja and remained in his actual possession till 1794, when Raja Mahip Narayan Singh surrendered the control to the Governor-General by the agreement of the 27th of October of that year. In 1813 the present pargana of Doaba, which had hitherto been a part of Bihla in Shahabad, was transferred to the revenue subdivision of Ghazipur, and shortly afterwards the latter was separated from Benares and became an independent district. It comprised not only the existing district of that name, but also the whole of Ballia. In 1832 a redistribution of territory occurred, and pargana Sikandarpur, and probably Bhadaon, was assigned to Azamgarh; and again in 1837 portions of Kopachit and Kharid were assigned to the same district. For some time no further changes took place, and the Ballia tahsil, comprising the Ballia, Doaba and Kharid parganas, formed a subdivision of Ghazipur under a covenanted assistant posted at Ballia. On the 1st of November 1879, however, the district of Ballia was created by adding to the old subdivision the parganas of Lakhnesar and Kopachit from the Rasra tahsil, and those of Bhadaon and Sikandarpur from the Nagra tahsil of Azamgarh. These parganas were constituted a new tahsil with headquarters at Rasra. The Zahurabad pargana was retained in Ghazipur and attached to the Korantahil tahsil; while pargana Nathupur,\nhitherto belonging to the now extinct Nagra tahsil, was added to Sagri in the Azamgarh district. On the 10th of April 1882 a third tahsil, known as Bansdih, was formed out of pargana Kharid and 225 villages of Sikandarpur, to which was given the name of Sikandarpur East. At the same time 212 villages of Kopachit were transferred to Ballia and made into the new pargana of Kopachit East. On the 1st of April 1883 a further addition was made by uniting tappa Dhaka of pargana Zahurabad, comprising some 30 square miles, with Sikandarpur West; and on the 18th of November 1884 thirteen villages of Lakhnau, lying on the right bank of the Sarju, and surrounded by villages of Ghazipur, were given back to that district. The last important change took place on the 8th of March 1892, when the 168 villages of pargana Garha, together with Sarai Kota of Muhammadabad, were made over to Ballia and included in the Ballia tahsil. This transfer was supplemented in July of the same year by extending the boundary of Garha so as to include the large village of Narainpur and two others. Subsequent alterations of the boundary have been effected in another direction as the result of the erratic action of the great rivers. Thus on the 9th of June 1892 the village of Diara Khawaspur was transferred from Shahabad in Bengal to Ballia as the Ganges had left it on the left bank; and on the 9th of January 1896 a still larger area, including the four villages of Bijaura, Sital Patti, Sheopur and Beliapah, was similarly made over to Ballia from Shahabad. Various other exchanges were made in 1906; but they are of little importance, as they seldom affect the population, since the inhabitants of a diluviated site generally retire inland and do not cross the river.\n\nIn the presence of these numerous and extensive changes it is far from easy to give a connected and concise account of the fiscal history of the district; but the task is greatly simplified by the fact that almost the entire area is permanently settled. Properly speaking, the account of the fiscal history begins with the assumption of the control of the province by the British Government in 1775; though the actual administration did not commence till 1794, the date of the agreement with Raja Mahip Narayan Singh of Benares. As a matter of fact, one portion of the\ndistrict had already come into the possession of the British, for in 1765 Bihar was made over to the East India Company together with Bengal and Orissa, and this province included pargana Doaba, which remained in the districts of Shahabad and Saran till 1818. In these early days the old native system was maintained, whereby annual settlements were made by the amils or revenue collectors in each pargana. The amount to be paid by these officials was fixed beforehand by competition, and then the amils proceeded to raise as much as they could collect by agreement with the zamindars, or, in the event of their recusancy, with the cultivators themselves. Sometimes, too, the settlement was made with an outsider, should the zamindar refuse to engage; but this practice was avoided as far as possible, as the old proprietors were the most natural and convenient agents for collecting. The arrangement was no more satisfactory in Benares than in other provinces, the chief reason being that it was impossible to place an adequate check on extortion or to safeguard in any way the interests of the agricultural community.\n\nNo real alteration of policy was, however, adopted till the days of Mr. Jonathan Duncan, who was appointed Resident of Benares in 1787. He at once directed his attention towards securing an improved condition of affairs, as the province was in a most unsatisfactory condition and large areas of hitherto fertile land had become waste on account of famine and the general mismanagement. His first step was to abolish competition between amils and to introduce a regular settlement based on the ascertained collections of previous years. In order to prevent further exactions, all additional cesses were prohibited, and it was laid down that in no case should the rates of 1779 be exceeded. The amils were still retained, but in 1788 their leases were given for a period of five years on the condition that they should make sub-settlements with the zamindars on the same estimates of assessment as those on which their own settlements were calculated.\n\nThe next great step was that of imitating the scheme of a permanent settlement devised for Bihar and the greater part of lower Bengal. The measure was not attempted hastily, as it involved such an important departure from the existing principles, and\nwhile it was admittedly an experiment on the part of the administration, its import was neither understood nor appreciated by the persons more immediately concerned. The demand assessed in 1789 was at first sanctioned for four years, then for ten, then for the life of the persons engaging, and finally under Regulation II of 1795, it was declared permanent for ever. As already mentioned in the preceding chapter, this permanence involved a recognition of proprietary right in perpetuity\u2014an idea which was altogether new to the landowners, who in many cases refused to engage, failing to appreciate the benefits that would thus accrue to them. In such cases the land was given in farm on a temporary settlement to others, and this system of farming was not finally abandoned till 1810. The general rules guiding the procedure laid down that leases, specifying the demand and other conditions, should be given to the zamindars; but this could not be carried out in its entirety owing to the absence of any register of proprietary holdings and of the various papers which are now generally known as a record of rights. In actual practice the leases were given to certain persons who came forward and undertook the engagements, and who were afterwards known as Lambardars; but these did not by any means include all the interested parties, for it was recognised that the proprietary right was vested in the whole body of zamindars and pattidars. This recognition afterwards resulted in the separation of local areas and the subdivision of joint villages, and in the absence of any authoritative record the process usually proved extremely difficult. Numberless disputes took place, not unfrequently attended with violence, for the distribution of the proprietary interest on the basis of actual possession turned out to be a very different matter from a division into shares according to a genealogical tree. The case of pargana Lakhnesar has been already mentioned in dealing with the land tenures of the district. Here the rules of assessment proved impossible to follow, and consequently the revenue fixed in the lump by Raja Balwant Singh was allowed to continue unaltered, and for nearly a century no attempt was made to define the limits of the interests held by the innumerable co-sharers. The settlement of pargana Kopachli was made by Mr. Treves, the junior assistant at Benares, and that of Ballis.\nGarha, Kharid and Sikandarpur by the amil\u00e9, whose work was supervised by Mr. Duncan himself. Pargana Doaba was not settled till 1793, the assessment being at first for ten years and then forever. The Bihar officials engaged in this work conducted their operations under somewhat different rules from those laid down by Mr. Duncan. Apparently the idea was that any attempt at enhancement should be discouraged, and among other conditions it was laid down that where a fixed demand had been in force it should not be altered. The result is to be seen in a most inadequate revenue demand, a notorious example being afforded by taluqa Singahi, where the old customary assessment of one gold mohar per manusa, or Rs. 304 for the whole estate, was allowed to continue, whereas a hundred years later the rent-roll was nearly Rs. 50,000, the incidence of the revenue being less than seven pies per acre of cultivation.\n\nThe revenue as assessed at the permanent settlement is shown in the appendix, where a table gives the details for each pargana.* The total for the present district was Rs. 5,74,212, and this sum has remained unaltered, so far as the actual lands concerned are involved. Considerable additions have been made subsequently, but these are not due in any way to an enhancement of the original demand, but have their origin in the resumption of revenue-free grants, to the settlement of newly-formed alluvial areas, and to the transfer of lands from Bengal owing to the action of the Gagra and Ganges. It should be noted also that where the proprietors refused to engage and their lands were given in farm, a fresh assessment, generally resulting in an increased demand, was made with the zamindars at the time of the revision of records in 1840. Details of the changes will be given later in the accounts of the various parganas.\n\nThe chief objection to the permanent settlement lay in the fact that it was not sufficiently complete. Numerous difficulties occurred in actual practice, for which no provision had been made, and which led in a short time to serious trouble. The first of the omissions was the absence of any survey and the definition of boundaries. Numberless disputes arose between the owners of the various pattis on the question of possession, and\n\n* Appendix, Table IX.\nalso from the want of correspondence between actual possession and the extent of shares as theoretically determined by ancestral right. Many other quarrels, too, sprang up in consequence of taking engagements from the lumberdars; for it was soon acknowledged that the latter did not fully represent the proprietary interest, while their status undoubtedly gave them an unfair advantage. Before the permanent settlement it was generally the case that all members of the clan were in some sense zamindars, the best instance of this being found in pargana Lakhnagar, where the state of affairs still corresponds with that prevailing in the hill districts of Kumaun, and the words Sengar and zamindar are synonymous. In other cases the leading families appropriated the zamindari right, and the weaker members of the clan were reduced to the position of mere tenants of their sir holdings. No attempt to deal with this problem had been made at the permanent settlement, and consequently much of the injustice done was irremediable. Further trouble was caused in many instances by the rigid system of collection. When a proprietor or a community fell into arrears recourse was readily had to sale; and thus on account of temporary balances the land was alienated in perpetuity. The mischief done by adhering to this system was very great, for it was long before Government recognised the inexpediency of ejecting the old owners of the soil. This truth was brought home to the authorities in an unpleasant manner by the results of these sales, for the auction-purchaser was in many cases unable to obtain possession, while almost invariably any attempt to enforce it was accompanied by rioting and violence. An endeavour was made experimentally to remedy these defects in Regulation VIII of 1800, whereby a register was to be prepared showing the name of each estate, the proprietors, the villagers and shares held by each, the gross rental, and the details of measurement where already ascertainable. In practice this proved of little use, for the proprietors meant merely the lumberdars of the permanent settlement, and no records of areas and holdings were in existence. Under Regulation XII of 1817 the duties of patwaris were defined. They were directed to submit returns twice yearly, showing the produce of each harvest, the tenants, and the areas\nheld by them. Very few of these returns are now extant, and indeed the only old records comprise a list of revenue-free tenures of 1219 Faali and the mutation register of 1850. The latter showed all the changes that had occurred since the permanent settlement, embodying all corrections made in previous years, but it was open to the same defect in that the landlords alone were recorded as proprietors. It was not till 1840 that Regulation VII of 1822 and Regulation IX of 1833 were applied to Ghazipur and a complete record of rights prepared. This was preceded by a professional survey, which supplied standard village maps of great excellence and rendered it possible to put an end to the numerous boundary disputes. The work of revision in the Ghazipur parganas was carried on by Mr. C. Raike in 1840 and the following year. Sikandarpur and Bhadaon were then in Amnagarh, and had already been dealt with in 1837 by Mr. (afterwards Sir R.) Montgomery. A further revision was made in those two parganas in 1847 by Mr. J. Wedderburn, together with a readjustment of settlement in some alluvial lands. The record of rights comprised the khasra, which gave for every field a number, the detail of length and breadth, the area calculated by multiplying the average length and breadth, the name of the cultivator and the crop; the khatauni, arranging the various holdings by pattas and tenures; the khewat or record of proprietary shares, and the wajib-ul-arz, giving a brief account of the fiscal history and village customs. The records were fairly accurate, except in the case of pargana Lakhnesar, where they proved practically useless. They were, however, in many respects incomplete, as rent-free holdings were either entered wrongly or not shown at all, sir lands were seldom recorded as such, few shikari holdings were registered, and gurnauth tenures were incorporated in those of occupancy tenants. Another disadvantage was the inaccuracy resulting from so rough a system of obtaining areas, and much of the undoubted advantage derived from the work was rendered of no avail by the failure to maintain the record carefully in after years.\n\nIn 1880 the collector of Ghazipur attempted to bring the village papers up to date through the agency of the patwaris, but little good was effected in this way. A partial revision was\nundertaken between 1866 and 1868 by Rai Baldeo Bakhsh, deputy collector; but this only dealt with 430 villages of the present district, and suffered from the defect of not being authoritative, as it was carried out on behalf of those zamindars who agreed to pay the cost. At the same time the preparation of the village papers for pargana Lakhnesar was undertaken under the order of Government by Munshi Debi Prasad, then tahsildar of Rasna. This proved a very onerous task, but was completed with fair success, although subsequent examination exposed numerous errors.\n\nEventually it was found necessary to resort to a regular revision for the whole of the Ghazipur district, and the parganas now included in Ballia were brought under settlement in July 1880. The whole of the work was carried out by the collector, Mr. D.T. Roberts, assisted by two deputy collectors. The revision was preceded by a cadastral survey, which was completed in 1882-83. As the maps were received the task of compiling the record was commenced, this record including the same papers as that of 1840, while at the same time a distribution of the revenue was effected in each mauza. The undertaking proved both arduous and costly, as the settlement was not closed till 1885. This was rendered unavoidable by reason of the minute subdivision prevailing and the small size of the fields, while in Lakhnesar and Kharid the incorrectness of the former records constituted a great difficulty, and throughout the district there was an immense amount of litigation to be disposed of. For a detailed account of the proceedings reference must be made to Mr. Roberts' exhaustive report on the revision. The parganas of Bhadaou and Sikandarpur had been dealt with while still included in the Azamgarh district. The survey took place between 1874 and 1877, and the revision was entrusted to Mr. J. Vaughan, under the supervision of Mr. J. R. Reid, then settlement officer of Azamgarh. The report on the revision, which was submitted in 1880, was embodied in that of the Azamgarh settlement, though the parganas had in the meantime been transferred to Ballia.\n\nIn revising the records no alteration was, of course, made in the revenue as fixed at the permanent settlement, but at the same time a considerable increase was obtained in the total demand...\nas the result of assessment in the temporarily-settled tracts which had been added to the district by the action of the great rivers, and also by that of leased revenue-free holdings of former days. At the same time it was found possible to estimate in some degree the revenue that might have been obtained had the district remained under a temporary system of assessment. It was found that in the Ghazipur portion of this district the actual demand represented only 31 per cent. of the net assets, a full revenue at 50 per cent. yielding some Rs. 2,62,000 more than that of the permanent settlement, while in the Azamgarh parganas an additional Rs. 1,60,000 would have been obtained. Since that time both rents and the value of produce have risen greatly, so that at the present day it may safely be estimated that the annual benefit to the zamindars, and in a considerable manner to the tenants also, amounts to at least five and a half lakhs. It should be noted, however, that this calculation is for practical purposes useless, as the assets in a permanently-settled district fall very short of the amount that would be realized in so fertile a tract as Ballia were a temporary settlement in force; and Mr. Roberts estimated from the known capacities of the district that if rents were raised here to the average of rents for similar land in other parts of the province and assessment made on that corrected rental, the revenue would be at least double the present demand. On the other hand it must be admitted that the permanent assessment was far from unduly lenient at the time that it was introduced. In fact, for many years the revenue was collected with much difficulty, as the country had long suffered from bad administration and internal feuds. Perhaps the most serious defect in the permanent settlement was its inequality. Some idea of this can be obtained from an examination of the incidence of the revenue in the various parganas, as shown in the appendix.* But the most glaring instances do not there appear, as they are confined as a rule to single villages, and the only pargana in which the general revenue-rate is unduly low, as compared with that of the district as a whole, is Lakhnesar, in which the obstinate and combined resistance of the Bengar community obtained for them a rate which does not now exceed eight annas per bigha of cultivation.\n\n* Appendix, Table X.\nThe same table shows the revenue collected in 1905, and calls for some explanation as to the difference between the various pargana totals in that year and those of the last year of revision as given in the preceding tabular statement.* The decrease is partly due to the acquisition of land by Government, as in the case of the new civil station at Ballia, or for railway purposes, the latter aggregating 3,034 acres on the various sections, for which a price of Rs. 4,65,000 was paid. The chief factor in the fluctuations, however, is the continual change in the alluvial mohals along the Ghagra and Ganges, the fiscal history of which is both lengthy and complicated.\n\nThe position differs considerably in the case of the two rivers, as is evident from the account of the diaras given in Chapter I. In the Ghagra mohals the entire contour of the country is apt to be changed after each annual flood; while in those along the Ganges the alterations are gradual, the river slowly eroding the land or throwing up a fresh deposit season after season. The Ghagra also frequently forms islands, which are treated as Government property, though the only exercise of proprietary right consists in the choice of the persons with whom a settlement is to be made. These islands, however, in the course of time become attached to the mainland, and either go to Bengal or fill up the site of some diluviated village in Ballia\u2014an event which invariably gives rise to a lively dispute. The case may be compared to that of a map drawn at random upon a slate. Wipe the slate clean and redraw a fresh map: the result will be that the same area is occupied but in a totally different manner. Not a feature of the old map remains, and the question is how to identify the boundaries of the old mohals. There could be no more fertile ground for litigation, and indeed there is not a diara in the district which has not been the subject of dispute in the criminal, civil or revenue courts, or in all three. Sometimes, no doubt, the matter is simplified by the fact that where adjoining mohals belong to a taluqdari which has a wide river frontage, or where the same landowner owns estates on both sides of the river; but it is far more usual for a dispute to arise between the squatters on the same or opposite banks,\n\n* Appendix, Table IX.\nand when an opportunity for a quarrel occurs, such practised hands at litigation as the riverside landowners never fail to take advantage of it. These cases are naturally most difficult to decide, for the verdict must of necessity be based mainly on guess work; while it is often doubtful whether the land should be treated as an accretion or as a reformation, and these difficulties, added to those arising from imperfectly or corruptly prepared maps, and from decisions given by courts without special knowledge of surveying, make no end to the complications which a suit concerning darya lands may present. The law is still that laid down in Regulation XI of 1825, which provides for the maintenance of established local usage, and failing this declares that land gained by gradual accretion belongs to the person to whose land it is annexed. Where, however, the change is sudden, it remains the property of the original owner if still recognizable; while islands accrue to Government, or if the channel is fordable at any season, the island constitutes an increment on the fordable side. The law is good enough so long as the island remains an island; but this is never the case, and Mr. Roberts held that the only solution was to treat all accretions as islands under the law. As regards local custom, the deep-stream rule prevails, except in the case of sudden change: in Doaba there is a peculiar rule, but this only affects the lands along the Ganges confronting pargana Rihia in the Shahabad district. The Ghagra alluvial mahals are 171 in number, including five in Sikandarpur East, eleven in Kharid and one in Doaba. In these the ordinary rules are in force, the settlement being revised quinquennially; the present revision being the fifth that has taken place since 1882. They are, of course, settled but temporarily, and no record is maintained of the permanent alluvial mahals. There is, however, a list of the villages bordering on the river, and in these the revenue is suspended in whole or in part when erosion renders such a step necessary. At the present time this measure has been taken in one village of Sikandarpur West and seven of Kharid; these mahals are subject to inspection and revision every year.\n\nIn the case of the alluvial lands along the Ganges, the same procedure is followed ordinarily. There are two temporarily-settled mahals in pargana Ballia, four in Doaba, and four in\nGarha, which are treated like those bordering the Ghagra. At the last revision the total revenue demand for all these mahals was Rs. 32,286 and that of the previous revision Rs. 30,208. Suspension of revenue has been allowed in 38 mahals of Ballia in which erosion has occurred, and these are inspected yearly. Elsewhere a special system is in force, which requires some explanation.\n\nIt has been shown that the Ganges affects a vastly greater area and far more valuable land than the northern river, and that the changes are comparatively gradual. The deep stream rule everywhere prevails, and consequently land diluviated on this side and reformed in Shahabad is settled in the latter district. Where both banks belong to the Dumraon estate, the resultant difficulty is but small and merely concerns tenant right; but in other cases endless disputes and riots have occurred. The course of events is almost always the same, whether tenants or proprietors are directly concerned: the new land is claimed by two parties, an affray ensues, the magistrate intervenes, and fixes a provisional boundary, and then the disputants enter on a protracted course of litigation in the civil courts. This briefly is the history of all the diuans in pargana Ballia for the last century and more. But in Doaba the case is different. That pargana was once merely a part of Biblia in Shahabad, and for that reason the deep stream rule has been ignored. The proprietary right is determined by reference to the village site and not to the river channel. If a village be diluviated and the site emerges after a time on the opposite bank, the village is demarqued afresh on that bank. Thus there can be no unappropriated river bed, for all the land belongs to some village or another, and therefore there can be no alluvial increment to a village bounded on all sides by other villages. As the Ganges was not the boundary of Biblia, so neither was it the boundary of those villages which might emerge on one side or the other. This rule could not apply of course to villages facing pargana Arrah, and there the deep-stream system was adopted: the only difficulty occurred at the trijunction of Biblia, Arrah and Doaba, where the two methods clashed. The problem has been solved effectually, so far as fiscal matters are concerned, by a special agreement made with the Dumraon estate, which embraces practically all\nthe disputable area, by which the permanent revenue demand remains unchanged for ever, and the question of alluvion and dilution thus becomes of no import. This agreement applies in all cases where the land on both sides belongs to Durrani, in pargana Ballia as well as in Doaba; it is of course of no effect where the proprietary right is divided, and for the history of the innumerable disputes in these villages reference can only be made to the exhaustive account given in Mr. Roberts' report.\n\nThe revenue demand as shown in the appendix is the gross amount assessed on the land, and is somewhat greater than the actual sum received by Government. The difference consists in the revenue assigned to the proprietors of the two jagirs, of which some account has been given in the preceding chapter. The Kantu Babu jagir has an area, of 10,988 acres and that of Sonwani 9,962 acres. In addition to these there are two small revenue-free estates, known as Budha Musafi in Sikandarpur East, 242 acres in extent; and Bhatwalia, a village of 62 acres, in Doaba. The former is an old Musalman holding, which was confirmed in 1835; the origin of the latter is unknown, but the grant was first made to Bhata, whose descendants still own the village. It appears to have escaped resumption in 1840 on the ground that it was originally in Bihar, where only those estates which exceeded one hundred bighas in area were resumed. In the rest of the district all the minor lands of more than fifty bighas formed the subject of inquiry at the revision of records, and with the exceptions noted above were regularly assessed to revenue. The large village of Chand Diara, which formerly belonged to Saran and was transferred to this province in 1841, had originally been revenue-free, but was resumed and assessed in 1888 while still in Bihar.\n\nThe cesses paid in addition to the land revenue are the same as those levied throughout the permanently-settled area of the Benares division. The pattauri rate of two per cent, on the annual value of each estate obtained the force of law in 1889, and the assessment was made for 15 years; but in 1906 the cess was abolished throughout the province, the relief thus afforded amounting to Rs. 50,815, the sum due in the previous year. The existing cesses now include the acreage rate, the commuted jagir cess and the road cess, of which only the first is credited.\nto provincial funds. This acreage cess was first levied under Act XVIII of 1871, which was afterwards replaced by Act III of 1878, in order to defray the expenditure incurred or likely to be incurred for the relief and prevention of famine. The Act permitted the reservation of a portion for local purposes tending to promote the welfare of the district. The rate is assessed at two annas per acre of cultivation, the amount being determined for ten years. The last revision was in 1905, and the results of this are to be seen in the appendix, the total demand for the district being Rs. 93,337.* The two per cent. famine rate of the temporarily-settled district here took the form of an addition to the acreage cess to the extent of six pice per acre, but this was abolished in 1905. Of the total income from the acreage rate 20 per cent. has been hitherto credited to the district board and the remainder to provincial funds.\n\nThe other cesses are purely local. The road cess is levied at the rate of one per cent. on the revenue, and amounts to Rs. 6,816 from the whole district. This due is of great antiquity, as the maintenance of the roads has for centuries been considered the duty of those who engaged for the payment of the demand owing to the state. The idea of taking a fixed sum from the zamindars for the purpose appears to have originated with the collector of Jaunpur in 1797, though the introduction of the cess does not appear to have been general. It is possible that it was collected for a few years, but it seems that it dropped out of use and was not regularly introduced in this district till 1841. Another duty of the zamindars was to provide village watchmen, and for the maintenance of these officials it was the universal custom to make grants of rent-free land. The right of Government to resume the revenue of such land in consideration of relieving the proprietors of this duty was declared in Regulation I of 1793; and at the same time it was stipulated that such resumed revenue should be appropriated to no other purpose but that of defraying the expense of the police. Collectors were instructed not to add the produce of such lands to the regular revenue, but to credit the amount thus obtained to a separate fund. No register was, however, drawn up to show what lands were thus resumed, nor was there\n\n* Appendix, Table X.\nany regular rule as to what extent of land a village chaukidar might claim for his support. At the revision of records in 1840 the lands found in their possession were entered as the jagirs of the goraitis or watchmen: there was a general instruction to procure, if possible, five bighas of land for each gorait; but in actual practice the average was much less than this, and the provision of jagirs, as well as their restoration when the goraitis were dispossessed, proved a source of constant trouble. In 1871 the goraitis were converted into village chaukidars in receipt of a monthly cash wage from Government, and the jagirs were consequently resumed and settled with the zamindars, or occasionally with panwadhars or under-proprietors. The amounts assessed on these lands are treated as a local cess and not added to the land revenue, the total for the whole district being Rs. 10,367. This sum is only liable to alteration in the case of the transfer of a village from one district to another; so that it is merely possible for the total to be decreased, the reason being that if a village is transferred from Ballia to Bengal the jagir cess will be abolished as not in force in that province, while if the same village at any time reappears on this side of the river, the cess cannot be imposed afresh. Such cases are no doubt rare and only concern small amounts.\n\nUnder existing arrangements the district is divided for the purposes of police administration into twelve circles, the original number having been increased by one on account of the transfer of pargana Garha from Ghazipur in 1892. These circles have an average area of 104 square miles, with a population of 82,314 persons apiece. Six of the stations are of the first class, being located at Ballia, Bairia, Banadih, Sikandarpur, Rasra and Garwar; three are of the second class at Reoti, Nagra and Korantadih; and the remainder of the third class, at Haldi, Ulhman and Halidharpur. In addition to these, there were formerly six outposts at Phopma, Sahatwar, Maniar, Chandpur, Barnali and Tola Siwan Rai; but all of these have been abolished with the exception of the first and last, while a third has been instituted at Nachi. This distribution will be modified to some extent under the new scheme of reallocation, though the matter is still under discussion.\n\nThe police force is in the charge of the superintendent, who is assisted by one circle inspector. In 1906 it comprised 3.\nsub-inspectors, 44 head constables and 274 men, their distribution in 1906 being shown in the appendix.* These figures include the armed police, numbering one sub-inspector, 13 head constables, and 94 men, and also the civil reserve of five sub-inspectors, 16 head constables and 40 men, located at the police headquarters in Ballia. They are maintained from provincial revenues at an annual cost of Rs. 45,072. Besides this regular force there is the Ballia municipal police, a body of 23 men, who will be replaced as soon as possible by provincial police, with an increase of three constables in reserve. The Act XX towns have their own watch and ward in the shape of 90 men of all grades maintained from town funds at an annual cost of Rs. 6,228. The rural police or village chaukidars number 1,330, and the road police, who patrol the metalled roads from Ballia to R\u00e0ma and Ghazipur, 12 men in all. They are now universally paid in cash from the incorporated local funds; the annual expenditure under this head being Rs. 50,070. Up to 1871 the village chaukidars were known as gomits, and their remuneration consisted in a rent-free grant of land made by the zamindars; the subsequent development of this system has been already mentioned in dealing with the subject of cesses.\n\nStatistics given in the appendix afford some idea of the condition of the district from the point of view of criminal administration.\u2020 The returns show that on the whole crime is light, and for the most part is of the same stamp as is usually to be found in purely agricultural tracts. The most remarkable feature is the prevalence of agrarian riots. This is not only due to the unusually large number of Rajputs among the population, but may chiefly be attributed to the frequent changes resulting from alluvion and diluvion on the banks of the Ganges and Ghagra. As already stated in treating of the topography of those tracts, the alterations in the course of the rivers' channels are a fruitful source of dispute, and in the majority of cases the quarrel is decided by violent measures. Added to this, the turbulent character of the landowning classes in conjunction with their notorious proneness to litigation, not uncommonly leads the party which has been worsted in the law courts to support its supposed rights by\n\n*Appendix, Table XVII. \u2020Appendix, Tables VII and VIII.\nan appeal to the latkhi. Apart from this, the bulk of the reported crime consists in petty thefts and burglaries. Robbery and dacoity are not uncommon, but the offences under these heads are seldom of a serious nature. In some parts of the district cattle-theft is more or less prevalent, and at times outbreaks of cattle-poisoning have occurred. The annual average number of convictions is, however, far from unduly large, especially if it be borne in mind that the criminal castes such as Bhars, Dusadhs and Chains form a considerable proportion of the population. The reason is that these people usually carry on their illegal operations in the province of Bengal, where their chances of detection and arrest are smaller than in their own country. Residents of Ballia are also responsible for a good deal of the crime that takes place on the greater waterways of the lower provinces and Assam.\n\nThere can be no doubt that in former days the practice of infanticide was very prevalent in Ballia. This was a natural result of the composition of the population, including so large a proportion of Rajputs and other castes which were of old addicted to the crime. As a result of a census of 1872 the population of many villages became suspected of the practice, and consequently 38 were proclaimed under Act VIII of 1870. It was afterwards believed that this measure had been taken on insufficient grounds, the chief of these being the inaccuracy of the enumeration. At the following census these doubts were confirmed to a large extent, and in April 1883 all the villages save 12 were withdrawn from the list. The remainder continued under the operation of the Act for some years longer, although no strong cases of guilt was made out against them, save that the birth and death statistics in these villages were unsatisfactory and afforded reason to believe that female infants were at any rate neglected if not deliberately murdered. Eventually eleven were withdrawn, and the last remaining village was exempted in April 1897. No further steps have been taken under the Act, and it is now considered that the practice has altogether disappeared.\n\nWhen the district was first constituted there was no jail, prisoners under trial being kept in the magistrate's lock-up, while convicted offenders were transferred in batches every week to Ghazipur. This procedure continued till April 1897,\nwhen a subsidiary jail was established at Korantadilh, the then headquarters of the district. A year later its designation was changed to that of a fifth-class jail, and this was transferred to Ballia when that place once more became the capital in March 1901. The building only contains accommodation for 38 prisoners, and only short-term convicts are lodged there. No manufactures of any kind are carried on, as is the case with all prisons of this class.\n\nWhen Ballia first became a district it was wholly under the excise distillery system, the liquor being supplied from Raora, where there was a Government distillery with three stills. Difficulties were soon experienced by reason of the geographical position and the fact that the illicit introduction of liquor from Bengal at lower rates could not be prevented. In September 1881 the outstill system was consequently introduced into the Ballia tahsil, which then comprised more than half the district; and in the following year the entire tract was administered on the same principle. The result was an increase in the liquor revenue from Rs. 25,706 to Rs. 1,02,875; but subsequently the Raora distillery was reopened and the distillery system applied again to the Raora tahsil. To this was added pargana Garha on its transfer to Ballia in 1892, and no further change occurred till April 1906, when the outstills were abolished and the whole district brought into the distillery area. In the meantime, however, the distillery at Raora had been closed in 1893, and its place taken by a bonded warehouse, the liquor being imported from Ghazipur, Jaunpur and Benares. Smuggling is now said to be rare, and opportunities for the distillation of illicit liquor are few, owing in great measure to the absence of jungle. Under the former arrangement there were 22 shops for the sale of liquor in the distillery tract and 69 shops in the outstill area; but the total number is now four wholesale and 70 retail shops in the whole district. The statistics of excise from 1890-91 onwards will be found in the appendix.* For the first ten years the receipts from country liquor averaged Rs. 30,200 annually, the seasonal fluctuations being comparatively small; while for the last five years the average was no less than Rs. 70,380 or nearly double the former\n\n*Appendix, Table 31.\namount, while in 1905-06 the total was Rs. 1,01,232. This increase is apparently due to enhanced competition for the outstill shops, which were let singly year by year, rather than to a greater consumption of liquor. The latter is only ascertainable for the distillery area, in which it averaged 1,718 gallons annually for the fifteen years, the largest amount being 2,622 gallons in the first year as compared with 2,092 gallons in the last, when the receipts were nearly three times as great.\n\nThe fermented liquors known as tari and sendhi are very largely consumed in this district, chiefly by the lower castes, and especially Bhars, Chamars, Pasis and Kabars. The trees are found in abundance, the most common being the tar or palmyra palm from which tari is obtained by tapping, though connoisseurs are said to prefer sendhi, which is derived from the khajur or date palm. The right to collect and sell these liquors is leased to contractors, each pargana being put up to auction separately. This system was adopted when the district was first formed, and is in force at the present time, though from 1899 to 1903 recourse was had to a shop-to-shop settlement, but the experiment proved a failure owing to the difficulty of securing small farmers in several parts. The income derived from this source is considerable. From 1891 to 1900 it averaged Rs. 7,884 annually, while during the next five years the figure had risen to Rs. 11,445.\n\nThe consumption of hemp drugs in various forms is also large. They are imported from the Benares warehouse, chiefly in the form of ganja and bhang, though charas also is used and is growing in popularity. Since the increase in the duty on ganja the amount consumed has exhibited a decline, but this has been compensated by larger sales of bhang. On an average the ganja sold in the district during the last five years has amounted to 42 maunds annually, a figure which is exceeded, so far as this particular form of drug is concerned, in few parts of the provinces; and in the preceding decade from 1891 to 1900 the average was somewhat over 43 maunds. The corresponding figures for charas for the same period were 5.67 and 4.15 maunds respectively. There are 67 shops for the sale of these drugs, which are purchased by Hindus of all grades, especially\nthose of the higher castes. The right of vend is farmed to a contractor, who under the present system takes a lease for three years. The average receipts from 1891 to 1900 were Rs. 15,587, while during the ensuing five years they rose to Rs. 30,164, the last triennial contract being for no less than Rs. 1,07,158.\n\nBallia is not an opium-consuming district, at any rate as regards the excisable article, for it is impossible to say to what extent the cultivators retain small quantities of the crude drug for their personal consumption. The amount thus illegally secreted is probably not large, for the growers are not as a rule addicted to its use, and the small Musalman population obviates any extensive demand for illicit opium. Very little, too, is smuggled into Bengal from this district, in spite of the high duty prevailing in that province. In former days a single contract for opium together with chandu and madak was given for the whole district, and there were only two shops, both situated in Ballia. The sale of chandu and madak was abolished in 1890, but the old system was maintained as regards opium, the entire area being farmed to one contractor. There are now 17 shops in the district, but the amount sold annually is very small, though it exhibits a slight tendency to rise. For the ten years ending in 1900 the average was 3-6 maunds annually, the receipts for the same period being Rs. 1,228. During the last five years the amount of opium sold has averaged five maunds, while the income from this source has increased to Rs. 1,878, the total in 1904-05 being Rs. 2,148. The latter figure gave an incidence of only Rs. 22 per ten thousand of the population, a lower proportion than is to be found in almost any other district. The bulk of the receipts are derived from the sale of opium, the license fees fetching less than Rs. 250 per annum.\n\nStamp duties are collected under the Indian Stamp Act (II of 1899), and the Court Fees Act (VII of 1870). A table given in the appendix shows the total receipts from stamps for each year since 1890-91, as well as details for judicial and other stamps.* For the first ten years the average aggregate amount thus realised was Rs. 1,30,560 annually, those from court fee and copy stamps bringing in Rs. 91,320 or nearly 70 per cent. of the whole.\n\n* Appendix, Table XIII.\nDuring the last five years the total average has been Rs. 1,44,543, towards which judicial stamps contributed Rs. 108,150; the proportion remaining almost the same as formerly. On the whole, there has been but a slight increase in the stamp income since the original constitution of the district, for in 1882 the amount obtained from this source was Rs. 1,11,483.\n\nThe registrar of the district is the civil judge of Ghazipur, subordinate to whom are the sub-registrars stationed at the three tahsil headquarters of Ballia, Rasra and Banjilah, no change having occurred in the number or location of the offices since Ballia first became a separate district. For the last ten years the receipts from registration have averaged Rs. 10,001 and the expenditure Rs. 3,272. The heaviest work is done at the Ballia office, which is responsible for more than 58 per cent. of the receipts, while the least is derived from Rasra, the total for that tahsil being little more than 10 per cent. of the whole. The aggregate amount is distinctly small as compared with that of other districts, but at the same time there has been a satisfactory increase during the past 25 years. In 1859-61 the number of documents registered was 3,403, the receipts being Rs. 6,634; while in 1900-01 the figures were 4,734 and Rs. 11,708 respectively. The total value of the property affected in the latter year was Rs. 25,60,000, of which almost the whole represented real estate.\n\nWhen income-tax was first introduced in these provinces Ballia was included in the Ghazipur and Azamgarh districts, and consequently no separate figures are available. After its abolition its place was taken to some extent by the income tax levied under Act II of 1878, which yield some Rs. 27,000 annually. A regular income-tax was reintroduced under Act II of 1880, and the sums realized from this source in each year since 1890-91 will be found in tabular form in the appendix.* The total showed a marked decline in 1903-04, resulting from the introduction of the new rule exempting from assessment incomes under a thousand rupees. The receipts for the preceding ten years had averaged Rs. 32,658, but for the next three years the figure dropped to Rs. 21,529. The great bulk of the payments are made under-\n\n* Appendix, Table XIII.\npart IV of the Act, the principal assessors being manufacturers, merchants, plotters and shopkeepers. Another table shows the details for the different taluks.* There is very little difference between the three subdivisions in this respect, though Baner pays slightly more than the others, and the lowest assessment is to be found, as is only to be expected, in taluq Banadil, which is the most rural part of the district, containing fewer sugar and saltpetre factories than the western and southern portions.\n\nThe postal arrangements of the district are now wholly under the control of the imperial authorities. The district did no longer exist, and even as early as 1880 there was only one district post-office, located at Balharpur. From the list given in the appendix it will be seen that there were in 1906 altogether 25 post-offices, including the head office at Ballia, twelve sub-offices, and fifteen branch offices. The number has been greatly increased since the introduction of the various lines of railway, and there are now post-offices at every station. The mails are carried as far as possible by rail, while in the interior the distribution is effected by means of runners. The work of the post-office has increased immensely of late years, not only in the matter of letters and parcels, but also in money-orders, the introduction of which has driven the old bazaar system out of the field. The returns in 1880 were shown at Rs. 8,101 only, while two years later the sum drawn from the various post-offices to meet payments of money-orders was Rs. 2,73,000. For the financial year 1905-66 the enormous sum of Rs. 18,315,810 was received in the district by money-orders from without, averaging Rs. 1,413,16 per month. The figures for the preceding five years show that on an average the payments to post-masters on letters of credit were Rs. 10,63,400 annually. The post-office is also employed to a large and increasing extent for the payment of revenue by money-order, the average amount thus credited to Government for the last five years being Rs. 1,01,542 per annum or more than one-seventh of the total demand.\n\nUp to 1857 there were no lines of telegraph in the district, and the want of them was a source of great inconvenience both to Government and to the public. In April of that year telegraph\n\n* Appendix, Table XIV\noffices were established at Ballia and Rasra in connection with Ghazipur, and a third was added at Korantadib in 1894, when the headquarters were temporarily located at that place. Subsequently the extension of the railway system has materially increased telegraphic facilities, as offices are now in existence at each of the fourteen railway stations.\n\nThe only municipality in the district is that of Ballia, which was so constituted on the 24th of November 1871. For eleven years prior to that date it was administered under Act XX of 1856. Its affairs are now managed by a board of eleven members, of whom nine are elected and the remainder nominated by Government. The income is derived mainly from a tax according to circumstance and property, supplemented by rents of municipal land, the surplus receipts from the Dadri fair, and several minor items. Details showing the income and expenditure under the main heads for each year since 1890 will be found in the appendix.* A number of towns in the district are administered under the provisions of Act XX of 1856. This measure was applied to Rasra and Sikandarpur on the 29th of February 1890, while on the 27th of February 1873 there were added to the list Banadib, Manir, Sahatwar, Bairia, Reoni and Tartipar. Baragnou-Chit-Firozpur was brought under the provisions of the same enactment in 1899, and on the 28th of July 1902 the operations of the Act were withdrawn from Tartipar, so that the number of towns now stands at eight. It is now proposed to raise Rasra to the status of a notified area under Act I of 1900. Details of the receipts and disbursements in each case will be given in the articles on the several places. The same towns have been brought under the provisions of the Village Sanitation Act, while the Vaccination Act (XIII of 1880) was applied to the municipality of Ballia on the 6th of May 1891.\n\nThe administration of local affairs is largely in the hands of the district board, a body which has been in existence since the introduction of Act XIV of 1883, when it took the place of the old district committee and was entrusted with more extended functions. The board consists of 13 members, of whom nine are elected, one being returned annually for a period of three years.\n\n* Appendix, Table XVI.\nfrom each tahsil, while the remaining four include the magistrates as chairman and the three subdivisional officers. The executive work is performed by the secretary, who is usually one of the subdivisional magistrates, and is controlled by the chairman. The duties of the board are of the usual description, comprising the management of local institutions outside the municipal area, such as roads, schools, dispensaries, ferries, cattle-pounds and the like. A table given in the appendix shows details of the income and the expenditure of the board under the more important heads for each year since 1890-91.*\n\nHitherto the position of the district has been one of deficit to a small extent, and the local sources of income have had to be supplemented by contributions from provincial funds. The largest amounts are expended on civil works, education and medical arrangements, which more than absorb the balance left from incorporated local funds after deducting the charges for police and general establishment. Besides the sums derived from cesses, considerable amounts are obtained from ferries, educational fees and other sources, but as a rule these do not suffice to make up the deficiency, which under the new system to be introduced in 1907 will be met from a larger fixed grant to the district.\n\nAmong the most important duties of the district board are those connected with the management of the educational establishment, the control of which is vested in the board, although the immediate supervision is in the hands of the officers belonging to the educational department. Since the constitution of the district in 1879 education has made great progress. There was then no high school, its place being taken by an anglo-veracular institution at Ballia with only 30 pupils on the rolls. At the same time there were middle vernacular schools at Raara, Bansdih, Rooti, Sahatwar and Sikandarpur; and 74 village schools were in existence, the total number of pupils being under 4,000. Under the administration of Mr. Roberts, education advanced rapidly in Ballia. The anglo-veracular school at headquarters was raised in 1885 to the niled entrance standard, while in 1888 it was constituted a Government district school, and now is in a flourishing condition with over 200 pupils on the\n\n*Appendix, Table XV.\nrolia. The number of middle schools has been increased to eight, that at Rooti having been reduced to the upper primary standard, while others have been added at Ballia, Bhaisaud, Balrin and Garwar. The number of both primary and secondary schools and the scholars attending them in each year since 1898-97 is shown in the appendix.* In 1900 there were 103 primary schools under the district board, in addition to 40 schools receiving a grant-in-aid from that authority and nine assisted by municipal funds. Besides these there were 32 unaided indigenous schools teaching Sanskrit, Arabic, Hindi and Urdu to 647 boys, the total number of scholars in vernacular schools being 9,062. There are two Sanskrit schools at Ballia aided by the district and municipal boards, one being the Jubilee Sanskrit Pathshala attached to the district school, and the other known as the Dobi Ram Pathshala, created in memory of his father by a wealthy local merchant. A third has recently been opened at the village of Mahhabatnagar or Suramnagar in pargana Dona. Female education, on the other hand, is very backward, as is usually the case in purely agricultural districts with no large towns. For some years a few schools for girls maintained a precarious existence, but the last was closed in 1901, and there was not a single girls' school in the district till a fresh start was made in 1907, when ten aided schools were opened.\n\nLiteracy.\n\nThe progress effected in the matter of education is to some extent illustrated by the returns of successive enumerations. In 1881, shortly after the formation of the district, the proportion of the male population able to read and write was 1.1 per cent., which was slightly below the general average for the provinces and compared unfavourably with that of Ghazipur, though it was considerably better than the results obtained in the adjoining districts of Azamgarh and Gorakhpur. At the following census of 1901 the proportion had, however, risen to 6.5 per cent., the improvement being greater than in any other district, and placing Ballia above the rest of the Bijnore division with the exception of the Bijnore district itself. At the last census the literate male population amounted to 6.8 per cent. of the whole, this figure being considerably in advance of the provincial average and\n\n*Appendix, Table XVIII.\nbetter than that of any of the adjoining districts save Azimgarh, where the progress achieved has been very remarkable. Of the total population 3-23 per cent. were able to read and write, and from this it appears that the number of literate females is quite insignificant. It amounted to only 12 per cent., though even this was better than the returns of 1881, which showed no more than 95 per cent. Generally speaking, the proportion is larger in the case of Musalmans than of Hindus, the respective figures being 7-21 and 6-57 per cent. of the males in each case. Female education is relatively more common among the Musalmans, though the actual numbers are too small to afford a just comparison, the actual totals being 140 literate Musalman females and 376 Hindus. As is the case throughout the eastern districts, the use of the Nagri character is far more general than that of the Persian. The latter is seldom employed, even by the Musalmans, and this is only to be expected in a district in which pure Urdu is very seldom to be heard.\n\nWhile the district board is responsible for the maintenance of the medical institutions and the upkeep of the vaccination establishment, the actual control of these departments is vested in the civil surgeon. When Ballia was first separated from Ghazipur in 1879 the only dispensaries were those at headquarters and at Bana. The former was not long afterwards destroyed by the action of the Ganges, and in its place a new district hospital was erected in 1882, between the town and the civil station. It affords accommodation for 20 in-door patients, while female and contagious wards are to be added as soon as funds allow. Other dispensaries have been established at Banaslih and at Hairia, the latter being actually situated in the village of Santarsa, a mile to the east of the town, and called after Mr. D. T. Roberts, who was for many years collector of the district. Both of these belong to the district board, and are in the charge of a hospital assistant aided by one compounder; they only provide accommodation for out-door patients. There is also a police hospital at Ballia, as well as a railway dispensary, the latter having been transferred from Aurihar in Ghazipur on the 1st of February 1888. It is in the charge of a hospital assistant and is under the supervision of the civil surgeon, who is also the railway\nmedical officer for the district. Only out-patients are treated here, but the hospital assistant attends railway servants at their own houses. The average daily attendance at the dispensaries during 1905 amounted to 318 persons, while the total number of patients treated was 44,010, this figure being double that recorded in 1881.\n\nThe administration of the cattle-pounds was at first in the hands of the magistrate, but after the constitution of the district board was made over to that body. These pounds bring in a considerable sum annually, the average net receipts under this head being Rs. 1,600 for the ten years ending in 1906. This excludes the sum realised from the pound at Ballia, the income from which is credited to municipal funds. The district board pounds are located at each of the various police-stations, and also in the towns of Maniar, Baragaon and Sahatwar, and in the villages of Bazidpur in pargana Doala, Ratsand in Kopahit East and Nawansagar in Sikandarpur East. The last was established in April 1900 and Bazidpur in July 1905, the rest having been in existence for several years.\n\nThe total area of nazaf land in the district is 1,355 acres, of which the largest amounts are to be found in pargana Ballia, 493 acres; Sikandarpur West, 379 acres; and Kharid, 238 acres. It consists mainly of land recently acquired by Government, either for roads and buildings or for the new civil station, or for similar purposes; and there are few of those old properties in the shape of forts and the like, which are so common in Oudh and elsewhere. The management is mainly entrusted to the district board and the Ballia municipality. There is a plot of 60 acres at Korantabib, including 12 acres of the old military encamping-ground and 48 acres of land formerly occupied by the stud farm. This property, which contains the inspection bungalow and scattered timber of some value, is leased by the district board to graziers and cultivators, and brings in the sum of about Rs. 300 annually. Other plots include the site of the old tahsil at Nagra, now planted with trees and managed by the district board; and the municipal nazaf at Ballia, consisting of four acres formerly occupied by the district courts and now leased to cultivators, and five acres taken up by the railway authorities for brick fields.\nand now surrounded by the new town. The total area does not include Island 36 in pargana Doaha, which was formed by the Ghagya some years ago, and is managed by the collector under the Board of Revenue. It is now only an island during the rains; the land is unassessed, and the rent-roll fluctuates with the action of the river. In 1900 it amounted to Rs. 3,600, the total area being 3,216 acres, of which 977 acres were cultivated.\nCHAPTER V.\n\nHistory.\n\nPractically nothing is known of the early history of the district. Mounds and fragmentary remains of a structural character are found in many places, and it can hardly be doubted that Ballia was inhabited from an early date. At Khairabad near Turiapar a considerable area is occupied by ruins from which coins of the Kushans have been obtained. It has been suggested that the site of the Buddhist monastery mentioned by Hiuen Tsang under the name of Aviddha-karma or \"unpierced ears,\" and by Fa Hian as Aranya or \"desert\" was close to Ballia town, while Carlyle proposed to identify Narainpur in pargana Garha with the temple of Narayana Deva visited by Hiuen Tsang.*\n\nThis is a brief summary, and even this is merely speculative. No records of the past have been preserved, beyond vague tradition and the heaps of earth and broken brick which are supposed to represent old habitations of former dominant races. It cannot, moreover, be stated with any certainty who these aboriginal tribes were. The local legends assert that they were Thugs and Cherus, the former holding the parganas of Lakhnepur, Ehudan and Sikandarpur, while the latter ruled in the eastern half of the district. These races appear to have held sway in the dark ages which succeeded the more or less enlightened days of Buddhist dominion, when northern India was included in the empire of Asoka and afterwards in that of the Guptas. The mounds at Pakka-kot near Baraganu, at Bansdhi, at Karuni and Zirabari in pargana Ballia, as well as several others, are assigned to the Cherus, and those at Lakhnepur and elsewhere to the Thugs.\n\nThe nature of the next stage in the history of the district is clear; but none the less it is impossible to determine the manner in which the change was brought about, or to fix the date with\n\n* A.S.N.I., Vol. XXII.\nany approximation to certainty. Gradually the aboriginal tribes were displaced by Rajputs, who were in every case accompanied by their Brahman priests, or else, to a less extent, by Bhunihars. The origin of the latter is very obscure, but in practically every instance the clans maintain that this was not their home in early days, and that their ancestors migrated hither. They are not particularly numerous in this district, and their only large settlement is in pargana Garha, most of which remains in their possession. These are Bawar Bhunihara, who have a vague tradition of having journeyed east from Delhi, though this is inherently improbable, or else of having come from the south, sometimes even specifying the distant shores of the Carnatic. Be that as it may, the Bhunihars are relatively unimportant. Historical interest centres mainly in the Rajputs, who secured for themselves a preponderate position, never to be lost throughout the days of Muslim sovereignty. These Rajputs appear to have come from the west, at any rate in most cases. Their migration was spread over a considerable period, the dates of their advent given by the different clans ranging from the thirteenth to the seventeenth century. In the absence of any authoritative record, a chronology based on a varying and indefinite number of generations is of little value, while no more can be said for vague tradition in which similarity of names too often provides the sole ground for asserting an identity of origin. Among the earliest Rajput immigrants were the Sengars, who claim connection with the Etawah stock, though no date can be assigned to their arrival. The Dikhtis and the Kinwars, who are supposed to have a common origin; the Nikumbhas who settled in Beoti, the Naraunis, who state that they were originally Pariharas of Narwal; the Barwars who point to a Tomar descent; the Karcholis, who call themselves Sisodias, and many others, belong to the same period. All these were driven eastwards, apparently owing to Muslim pressure on the west. The Lohatamias of Deaba are of doubtful extraction, and so are the Donwars, who are believed to have come from Tirhut, whence also the Janwars of Oudh in some cases trace their descent. The Hayobans, who were once so powerful in this district, came at a comparatively late date from the south of the Ganges about 1528; and the Baia did not overrun Bharatpur.\nand Sikandarpur till a century later. So run the legends, but they must be accepted with reserve. The connection between the clans of Ballia and the well-known septs of the western districts is at least doubtful, even where the names remain the same; and when an altered nomenclature has to be explained away the suspicion becomes stronger. The fact that these races are now accepted as Rajputs matters little, and certainly cannot be adduced as a proof of Chhatri descent. On the other hand, it is now impossible to say who or what they were originally, and the problem of their extraction becomes on a level with that of the early status of the Bhumiharas.\n\nOne of the most remarkable features in the history of Ballia is the insignificance of the effect produced on the tract by the Musalman conquest of Hindustan. This is illustrated by the comparative absence of Muhammadan remains, and also by the manner in which the Rajputs were left in apparently undisturbed possession. The reason for this phenomenon is somewhat hard to seek. It is doubtless due in some measure to the geographical position of the tract, which forms a wedge between two unfordable rivers; but at the same time it can hardly be explained on the score of remoteness, as Ghazipur held a Musalman garrison from an early date, and at a later period the rise of the Muhammadan kingdom of Jaunpur would lead us to expect that a territory within comparatively easy reach of the capital would have been subjected to an effective domination. None the less, it appears that the forces of Islam seldom appeared beyond the Sarju, and that the country to the east of that river remained almost exclusively Hindu. Musalman place names are rare, and references to Ballia in the pages of the Musalman histories are still less common. The result is clearly shown in the practical absence of Musalman proprietors at the present day, those that remain being in most cases the descendants of the local gazis and qanun-gas who had their residence in the towns. The only Musalman colony of any note was in pargana Sikandarpur, and of this little more than bare tradition is at hand. The story goes that Qutb-ud-din Aibak passed through the district in 1194 after the capture of Benares, on his way to Bihar, and that he erected a fort on the spot now known as Qutbganj on the banks of the Ghagra. That\nthere was a fort at this place seems certain; that Qutb-ud-din built it is possible; but nothing more than this can be said. The tradition must be accepted with thankfulness, for the historian has to admit an utter absence of material for several centuries. Ghazipur was founded, it is said, about 1330; Jaunpur attained no importance till the days of Firoz Tughlaq; while Saran admittedly remained in the undisturbed possession of the Hindu zamindars till the time of the Lodi Sultans. It is therefore not surprising that no mention is made of any place in this district by the Muslim historians: for all practical purposes it was unconquered territory, and so it remained till the seat of Muslim power was brought nearer its borders. It is not suggested that there were any local chieftains powerful enough to resist the armies of Delhi, but rather the reverse: for the tract was politically so unimportant that it attracted no attention while real and formidable foes were threatening the territory of the Sultan on every side.\n\nIt has been suggested that the district at certain periods was either debatable ground, or else actually subject to the Muslim rulers of Bengal. It seems certain, however, that this was not the case, for the earlier Sultans of the east do not ever appear to have controlled Bihar, and it was not till a later date that the latter province came in any way under their subjection. How far such a conquest was effected is a matter not easy to be decided; but before it ever became possible a new power rose to prominence, and a hitherto unimportant town in the near vicinity of Ballia became the capital of a powerful kingdom. In the year 1377 the Sultan Firoz Shah, on his return from Eastern Bengal, appointed certain of his leading nobles to the charge of the provinces on the frontiers of the empire.* Under this arrangement Jaunpur was given to Malik Bahroz Sultanji, and Bihar to Malik Bir Afghan, who are said to have reduced the Hindus to complete subjection. After the death of Firoz, the affairs of the empire fell into confusion and the nobles increased their own power at the expense of the central authority. This tendency culminated in 1394, when the Wazir, Khwaja-i-Jahan, obtained from Mahmud Shah the administration of all the country between Kanauj and Bihar.\u2020 His capital was Jaunpur, and this place thereafter\n\n* E. H. I., IV., 13. \u2020 Ibid., IV., 29.\ncontinued to be the seat of a separate government for nearly a hundred years. The successive rulers of Jaunpur made their authority felt throughout the Ballia District, but no monument of their rule has been preserved and the traditions are silent on the subject, although it seems probable that at this epoch there was an extensive Muslim colonization in Khairid and Sikandarpur. In 1474 Husain Shah, the last king of Jaunpur, was driven out by Bahlul Lodi, his capital was taken, and the district once more passed into the hands of the Delhi Sultan. Bahlul appears to have pursued Husain as far as the confines of Bihar, for we are told that when he arrived in the town of Halali, he there heard the news of the death of Qutb Khan Lodi, his cousin, and that after passing some days in the performance of the customary mourning, he returned to Jaunpur, which he left in the possession of his son Barbak.* In 1493 the district was affected by an extensive Hindu rebellion, in which Barbak was driven out of Jaunpur, order being only restored by the arrival of Sikandar Lodi, who had succeeded Bahlul in 1488. Barbak's incapacity appears to have soon caused a recurrence of the trouble, and the country again rose in favour of Husain, who crossed the Ganges with a large force, but was driven back by Sikandar and pursued into Eastern Bengal. Sikandar Lodi is said to have been the founder of Sikandarpur, and it is at least probable that the place derived its name from the Sultan, though it may have been built by one of his officers. A garrison was presumably maintained there, though nothing is heard of the place during the troubled times which ensued between the death of Sikandar Lodi and the establishment of the Mughal power.\n\nWhen Babar overthrew Ibrahim Lodi at Panipat, the Afghan nobles of the east lost no time in consolidating their own power. During Ibrahim's reign indeed Darya Khan Labani, the governor of Bilaur, had openly rebelled, and his son, Bahadur Khan, assumed the royal state under the name of Muhammad Shah. He commanded a large force and extended his possessions westwards, defeating and then winning over to his side Nasir Khan Lodi, who then held Ghazipur.\u2020 Ibrahim was helpless in the face of this rebellion, for his hands were fully occupied in dealing with Alam Khan\n\n* E.H.L.V. 90. \u2020 Ibid., V. 106.\nLodi in the Punjab, to say nothing of Babar, who was already advancing on Hindustan. Owing to the absence of any settled government, the history of this period is extremely confused. It seems that Muhammad Shah remained the nominal king of Bihar, but his hold on that province and also on Jaunpur was very uncertain. There is an actual historical ground for this contention in the shape of an engraved stone found near the Ghagra and now fixed in the wall of the tomb Rukn-ud-din at Kharid. From this stone it appears that a mosque was built at Kharid in 1527 during the days of Nusrat Shah, king of Bengal. The name of the Bengal sovereign would not have occurred had Muhammad Shah exercised real authority in this tract, and indeed Kharid seems to have been at this time regularly in the possession of the Bengal Sultan. Tradition relates that the town was then known as Ghazipurabad, the city extending for a considerable distance between Sikandarpur and Turtipar.* Muhammad Shah of Bihar was succeeded by his son, Jalal Khan Lohani, who took the name of Jalal-ud-din Shah. The reign of Jalal-ud-din was short, for he was supplanted by his minister, Sher Khan, who was already powerful and who afterwards became known as Sher Shah. Fearing the designs of his minister, Jalal-ud-din fled for refuge to the king of Bengal, who sent an army against Sher Khan under his general, Ibrahim Khan. The latter was defeated, and Sher Khan became the real master of Jaunpur and Bihar.\n\nThis happened in 1528, and in the same year Babar, though nominally at peace with Bengal, marched eastwards on hearing that Nusrat Shah had encroached on Bihar. The Mughals hitherto reckoned Sher Khan among their adherents, but the Suri chieftain soon joined Mahmud Lodi, son of Sikandar Lodi, who styled himself king of Bihar. The Afghans took up a position on the north bank of the Ghagra, close to its confluence with the Ganges, while Babar proceeded by river to Ghazipur and thence to Chaunsa, there landing his army and marching to the confluence of the two streams. With his usual military skill, he sent his artillery over into Doaba to contain the enemy by a bombardment, and at the same time despatched Mirza Askari through this district with instructions to cross the Ghagra at Haldi and to threaten the\n\n* J. A. S. B., XLII, 296.\nAfghans on their right flank, while he himself crossed just below the confluence.* After unsuccessfully inviting Nusrat to separate from Mahmud's forces and withdraw the army of Kharid, as it was called, he proceeded to the attack, defeating the combined army and driving the Afghans across the Ghagra in the direction of Lucknow. Babar pursued them with no great haste, keeping to the north bank of the Ghagra and crossing that river in pargana Sagri of Azamgarh. The province of Bihar was then entrusted to Mirza Muhammad Zaman, and in 1529 a treaty of peace was arranged with the king of Bengal.\n\nOn the death of Babar the Afghans again assumed a position of independence. Sher Khan remained for a time nominally subject to Mahmud Lodi, but was constantly strengthening his own position, which was eventually rendered secure by Mahmud's abdication and retirement to Patna. In 1531 Sher Khan obtained possession of the fortress of Chunar, and in 1532 he came to terms with Humayun, though two years later he took advantage of the latter's absence in Gujarat by bringing all Bihar and Jaunpur under his control. About this time Nusrat Shah of Bengal died and was succeeded by his brother Mahmud Shah. This ruler seems to have been a person of no capacity, and the kingdom soon became disordered, giving Sher Khan the opportunity, of which he readily took advantage, of increasing his power in the east. When Humayun returned from Gujarat, he resolved to settle affairs in Bihar and Bengal, though this course obviously involved a conflict with Sher Khan. The latter had already defeated the forces of Mahmud and had taken possession of Gaur; and from that place he sent a message to Humayun, who had then reached Benares, proposing to give up Bihar to the emperor on condition of his remaining as ruler in Bengal. Humayun readily agreed to this suggestion, but afterwards was persuaded by Mahmud to invade Bengal, and this action led to open war. In 1538 Humayun reached Gaur, and while resting at that place the country in his rear fell entirely into the possession of Sher Khan, whose officers drove out all the Mughal governors. Humayun too late attempted to retreat, but was overthrown at the battle of Chaunna on the Ganges, close to the borders of this district. His defeat\n\n* E.H.I., IV, 289.\nwas completed in 1540 by the battle fought on the Ganges near Kannauj.\n\nSher Shah was now the ruler of all Hindustan, and the district continued under his control and that of his successor, Islam Shah, till 1545. Civil war then once more ensued between the various claimants to the throne, and, as far as can be ascertained from the hopeless confusion of the records, Bihar and Jaunpur remained, at least nominally, in the hands of Mohammad Adil Shah, who continued to reign in the east till his death in 1555 at the hands of Bahadur Shah of Bengal. In that year Humayun had re-established himself at Agra, while in 1556 the youthful Akbar overthrew the Afghans at Panipat and gained possession of Delhi. The east, however, still remained to be conquered once again, and it was not till 1559 that Ali Quli Khan, Khan Zaman, effected the reduction of Jaunpur and brought this district under the imperial control.* For the rest of Akbar's reign there is no mention of Ballia, though the country was doubtless affected by the subsequent rebellion of Khan Zaman, who had seized Ghazipur as well as Jaunpur. The history of this insurrection, which was not finally quelled till 1587, belongs properly to the account of Jaunpur. That place was then given, together with Ghazipur and Benares, to Mumim Khan, Khan-i-Khanan, who administered his jagir with great success for many years.\n\nThe fiscal records of Akbar's reign furnish a certain amount of information regarding the state of Ballia at that time, but throw very little fresh light on the obscure history of the district. In many parts of Hindustan the statements contained in the Ain-i-Akbari are peculiarly valuable as showing the territorial distribution of the various Chhattari clans at that epoch, but in the case of Ballia it is disappointing to find the clan unspecified in every instance but one. The tract lay partly in the sarkar of Ghazipur, the remainder, with the exception of Doaba, belonging to Jaunpur. Both of these sarkars were included in the province of Allahabad, while Doaba was not a separate pargana, but formed merely a portion of Faizpur Bihar in sarkar Rohtas of the Bihar province. As far as can be ascertained, the boundaries of the various parganas agree\n\n* E.B.I., V, 239.\napproximately with the existing lines of demarcation: the changes that have occurred from time to time originated during the last century, as for instance the transfer of tappa Kharid to Sikandarpur and of Shah Salmipur from Kopchit to the same pargana. This fact is of importance in that it enables us to form a relatively close comparison between the existing condition of affairs and those prevailing during the days of Akbar. It is, of course, impossible to determine the revenue then paid in Doaba, but this is to some extent compensated by the fact that four tappas of Sikandarpur are now included in the Amritsar district. Roughly, the result of such a comparison is that the district paid a revenue of Rs. 1,55,000 on a cultivated area of 80,200 acres. The latter figure is surprisingly small, being little more than one-seventh of the amount now under cultivation, and its accuracy is open to doubt, as there is no reason to believe that the district was then otherwise than thickly populated. It is probable that a large extent of jungle still remained, as the pargana boundaries were seldom clearly defined, and in many cases the villages seem to have been mere clearings; but at the same time it is almost impossible to suppose that seven-eighths of the district lay waste. At all events, the revenue demand was extremely high. At a very moderate estimate the purchasing power of the rupee in Akbar's days was at least four times as great as at present, and on this calculation the sum claimed by the state was considerably greater than the total existing demand, quite apart from the consideration that the latter is abnormally light by reason of the permanent settlement. In 1906 the average incidence per acre of cultivation was Re. 1-3-11, while the returns of the Ain-i-Abdari gave an incidence of Re. 1-14-10, equivalent to at least Rs. 8 of the present currency.\n\nTurning to the different parganas, we find that with the exception of Doaba all the names have been preserved unchanged, so that the task of reconstruction presents no difficulties whatever. In the wakar of Jaunpur were the three mahals or parganas of Kharid, Sikandarpur and Rhasmon. The first was then held by Kausik Rajputs, a remark which is somewhat surprising, as the Kausik territory in this district lies to the south of the Sarja, and the pargana of Kharid has apparently for centuries been\ndivided between other well-known clans with clearly marked spheres of influence. It had a cultivated area of 30,915 bighas, and paid a revenue of 14,45,743 dams. The pargana was clearly in a prosperous state, for it was able to provide no fewer than 50 horsemen and 5,000 foot soldiers. In all parts of the Ballia district the numbers of the local levies are remarkable, though the fact perhaps is only natural in view of the warlike disposition for which the Rajputs of the district have at all times been noted.\n\nThere was a brick fort on the banks of the Ghagra at the pargana capital, which appears to have been the principal place in the district. Sikandarpur was then somewhat larger than at present, as four tappas were afterwards transferred to Azamgarh, though the loss was to some extent compensated by the addition of tappa Dhaka from Zahurabad and Shah Salempur from Kopachit.\n\nThe leading zamindars were Brahmins, as the Bais had not yet asserted their supremacy, the traditional date of their advent being 1628. The military contingent was ten mounted men and 3,000 infantry, and the revenue demand was 17,06,417 dams on 32,574 bighas of cultivation. The small mahal of Bhadaon had but 4,800 bighas under tillage, the revenue being 2,29,315 dams; the landowners were Siddiqi Sheikhs, who provided ten horse and a hundred foot. In the sarkar of Ghazipur were the four mahals of Ballia, Kopachit, Lakhnesar and Garha. In each case the zamindars are described merely as Rajputs without any distinction of clan. The territorial arrangement was presumably the same as at present: Garha is the property of Bhuinbars, but these people invariably appear in the Ain-i-Akbari as either Brahmins or Rajputs. Ballia, which furnished 200 cavalry and 2,000 footmen, paid 12,50,000 dams on a cultivated area of 28,345 bighas. In Kopachit there were 19,267 bighas under cultivation, and the revenue was 9,42,190 dams; the local contingent being 20 horse and 2,000 foot. For Lakhnesar no details are given under the latter head; the pargana appears to have been in a backward state, as only 2,883 bighas were cultivated and the revenue was 1,26,636 dams. Garha, which contributed 200 footmen, was assessed at 5,00,000 dams, the land under cultivation amounting to 10,049 bighas.\nThe administrative arrangements of Akbar's day appear to have remained unchanged till 1722, and for the intervening period the history of the district is a complete blank. There are, no doubt, frequent references to both Ghazipur and Jaunpur, though these chiefly relate to the names of the officers in charge of those stations. These appointments necessarily affected Ballia, but the records contain no specific mention of the district, and it is needless here to repeat the chronicles of Ghazipur, Jaunpur and Azamgarh, which have been dealt with in their proper place. As in former times, the Rajputs of this district appear to have been left to themselves, and the only intrusion seems to have been that of Kunwar Dhir Singh, one of their own race. This man came from Bhojpur in Shahabad, and was apparently one of the Ujjains. Taking advantage of the confusion which ensued throughout the empire after the death of Aurangzeb, he set an example which was afterwards imitated by his kinsman, Kunwar Singh, during the mutiny. He set out with a comparatively small force and followed the line of the Ghagra, taking possession of a large tract of country along both banks of the river and extending his conquests as far west as Sagri in Azamgarh. Stories are still told of his cruelties and extortions, which rendered his name familiar to the inhabitants of this and the adjoining districts. His incursion seems, however, to have been but a temporary raid, for in 1715 his action attracted the notice of the authorities, and Sarbuland Khan, the governor of Allahabad, was deputed to suppress the rebellion. The task was accomplished with the aid of the Raja of Azamgarh, as the Rajput leader was driven northwards into Gorakhpur and slain near Padrauna.\n\nAbout this period the district, together with the rest of the Jaunpur and Ghazipur sarkars, as well as Behar and Chunar, were included in the jagir of Murtaza Khan, a nobleman of the imperial household, though he seems to have done little else than attempt to collect the revenue, and that with varying success. In 1722 Saadat Khan became governor of Oadh, and shortly afterwards he obtained from Murtaza Khan the lease of the four sarkars under an agreement to pay him seven lakhs of rupees per annum. From that date Ballia ceased to be subject directly to the imperial administration. The real ruler was the Nawab\nWazir of Oudh, though from the first the actual task of govern-\nment was made over to a subordinate. The earliest of these\nlieutenant-governors was Mir Rustam Ali, who had his head-\nquarters at Benares. He experienced considerable difficulty in\nreducing the turbulent Rajputs of Ballia to order and in compul-\nsion them to pay their revenue. To him is ascribed the large\nuntrounced camp on the banks of the Sarju in pargana Kopachit\nEast, close to the village of Dumri; and a tradition still exists\nthat it was from this place that Rustam Ali set out against the\nsamindars of Sakhpura in pargana Kharid; he met them near\nthe village of Garwar, defeated them in a pitched battle, and\nkilled nearly all their fighting men, from whose skulls he\nconstructed a pyramid, which, as the story goes, was the origin\nof the mound standing in the village of Garwar to the present\nday. Rustam Ali continued in charge till 1738, when he was\nreplaced by one of his dependants, Mansa Ram, the founder of\nthe Benares family. This man died within a year of his appoint-\nment, and was succeeded by his more famous son, Raja Balwant\nSingh, who ruled over Ghazipur on an annual rent of three lakhs\nto Shaikh Abdullah, a native of the district who had served with\ndistinction under Sarbuland Khan. Though he only held the\npost for a few years, Abdullah left his mark on Ghazipur, as to\nhim may be ascribed most of the old buildings at that place. He\ndied in 1744, leaving four sons, of whom the eldest, Fazl Ali,\nwas appointed to his father's position by Safdar Jang. The\nyoungest brother, Karam-ullah, was not satisfied with this\narrangement, and enlisted the support of Nawal Rai, the famous\ndeputy of the Nawab Wazir, with whose aid Fazl Ali was\nremoved; but the latter afterwards regained the favour of Safdar\nJang, and when Karam-ullah died in 1748, was once more placed\nin charge of Ghazipur on condition of paying an enhanced revenue.\nTwo years later Fazl Ali was ejected by the Rohillas and the\nPathans of Farrakhabad under Muhammad Amin Khan, but the\nraiders obtained no hold on the district, and in the following\nyear Fazl Ali re-established his authority. He was once again\nremoved from his post in 1754, shortly after the accession of\nShuja-ad-daula, towards whom he exhibited considerable insolence.\nGhazipur was given to Mohammad Ali Khan, but the latter's\ninability to deal with the Rajput population resulted in the restoration of Fazl Ali, whose charge was extended so as to include the Azamgarh district. This increase of power was accompanied with a deterioration in the government, and complaints of his injustice and oppression became so numerous that at length Beni Bahadur, the Nawab's deputy, and Raja Balwant Singh were deputed to bring Fazl Ali to reason. The governor was defeated and fled to Patna, and in 1761 Ghasipur was made over to Balwant Singh as an annual revenue of eight lacs.\n\nFrom this time forward the district remained a part of the territories held by the Raja of Benares as a feudatory, first of the Nawab Wazir of Oudh, and then of the East India Company. Balwant Singh's administration was probably superior to any that the district had hitherto enjoyed. One of his first steps was to set aside the forced and fraudulent sales by means of which Fazl Ali and his father had acquired large estates; this action was confirmed by Mr. Duncan in 1788, though unfortunately the lesson was not sufficient to prevent a repetition of similar action on the part of the amils in later years. Balwant Singh also imitated the policy of the early Oudh rulers by destroying the power of the local chieftains. His chief victim in this district was Bhunbal Deo of Haldi, who lost the whole of the Ballia pargana, for which he had hitherto engaged. The entire district was placed in the charge of amils, Mir Sharif Ali obtaining Ballia and Kharid, while Lakhnesar and Kopachit were given to Balam Das, Sikandarpur to Muzaffar Khan, and Garha, together with several of the Ghasipur parganas, to a mahajan named Bhaiya Ram. On several occasions the amils offered resistance to Balwant Singh, but in only one instance were their efforts successful. This exception to the general rule was provided by the Sengars of pargana Lakhnesar, who not only treated the demands of the Raja with contempt, but adopted an attitude of open hostility. Not content with the refusal to pay revenue, they attacked and pillaged his treasuries, so that eventually in 1794 Balwant Singh was compelled to proceed against them in person with a large force. For two days a desperate conflict was maintained, in which hundreds of lives\nwere lost: Raara was then most inaccessible by reason of the jungle which surrounded it, and the houses of the zamindars were all constructed with a view to defence. The Raja's troops managed to set the place on fire, so that the Sengars were compelled to withdraw; but so obstinate was their resistance that Balwant Singh was glad to effect a compromise, the zamindars being left in possession of their estates at a low fixed revenue which has remained unchanged unto this day.\n\nThe same year saw the active interference in the province on the part of the East India Company. When Shah Alam was defeated at Buxar, the forces of Balwant Singh had been detached from the imperial army as the attitude of that chief was open to suspicion. His intended treachery was proved by the result, for when by the treaty of the 29th December 1764, Shah Alam made over Ghazipur and all the other possessions of Balwant Singh to the Company, the Raja was allowed to retain the province on an annual lease.* The Court of Directors refused to ratify this agreement, which was replaced by the treaty of Allahabad signed on the 16th of August 1765, whereby the Nawab Wazir undertook to leave Balwant Singh in possession, so long as he paid the same revenues as formerly.\u2020 In spite of the repeated efforts of Shuja-ud-daula to break this engagement, Balwant Singh retained his position till his death in 1770. He was succeeded by his illegitimate son, Chat Singh, who continued to govern the province on the lines laid down by his father. The different parganas, or groups of parganas, were leased to amils, who were the actual administrators and only responsible to the Raja for the revenue. Ballia, Kharid, Sikandarpur, Kopachit and Lakhnesar were then held by Mir Sherif Ali, and Garha by Bakht Singh, a connection of the Raja on his mother's side. In 1774 Shuja-ud-daula died, and a year later his successor, Asaf-ud-daula, made over to the Company the sovereignty of all the districts dependent on Raja Chat Singh, this treaty being signed at Lucknow on the 21st of May 1775.\u2021 Pargana Doaba had already come into the possession of the British ten years earlier, for in 1765 the East India Company had obtained the grant of the district of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa. The change\n\n* Aitchison's Treaties, II, 8.\n\u2020 Ibid., II, 76.\n\u2021 Ibid., II, 86.\nof sovereign did not at first affect the province very closely, for Chet Singh was confirmed in the government on payment of a fixed revenue. On his deposition in 1781, Warren Hastings installed Mahip Narayan Singh as Raja, but with strictly limited powers.\n\nFrom this date the administration for all practical purposes passed into the hands of the Company. The mint, the police, civil and criminal justice had been taken from the Raja, and though the revenue was still nominally under his supervision, it was virtually under the management of the Resident. The old system of amils was, however, maintained in its entirety, and, as has been already mentioned in the preceding chapter, the fiscal history of the district does not properly begin till the appointment of Mr. Jonathan Duncan as Resident in 1787. In spite of the reformation effected with regard to the settlement of the land revenue and in numerous other directions, it soon became abundantly evident that the Raja was wholly unfit for the administration of the province, and in 1794 a new agreement was made, separating the territories immediately under the British Government from the Raja's family domains. This step had become urgent owing to the disorganised state of the country. Continued famines had caused the greatest distress and thrown wide areas out of cultivation, while in every direction lawlessness was manifest. Of this Patna afforded several notable examples. In 1789 a gang of two hundred Dusadhs from the district had attacked and looted the town of Gaya in Bengal, and the same people kept the Ganges and Ghagra in a perpetual state of insecurity. These criminals were of course protected by the zamindars, who received a yearly tribute from the gangs that found refuge in their villages. Occasionally the zamindars themselves imitated the example of their retainers, and during Mr. Duncan's time a party of travelling merchants were murdered at Maniar, and their money divided among the village owners.\n\nA criminal of a somewhat higher stamp was Jagannath Singh, the chief of the Sikandarpur Bais, whose career somewhat resembles that of his namesake in the district of Sultanpur in Oudh. He had been deprived of his estates by the Raja of Benares, and wandered about the country with a band of armed\nfollowers, levying exactions on the villagers. Under Mr. Duncan's administration he was arrested and brought into Benares, but was released at the request of the Sengars of Lakhnesar, who bound themselves to be responsible for his good behaviour. Mr. Duncan endeavoured by every means to induce him to adopt a peaceable mode of living, and the Parsia taluqa was made over to him. This, however, did not satisfy Jagannath, who laid claim to many other lands and eventually demanded the restoration of the whole Sikandarpur pargana. This proved too much for the Sengars, who arrested him and brought him to Benares. There he was again released, this time on the security of the Kansika of Chit; but he forthwith became an open rebel, defying the authority of Government and committing robberies, arson and murder in every direction. Troops were despatched against him on several occasions, but on their approach he invariably retired across the Ghagra, so that from 1795 it became necessary to keep a military force permanently quartered in the Ballia district. A reward of Rs. 10,000 was offered for his arrest, but it was not till 1800 that he was surprised by a party of cavalry when hiding in a wood some distance from his fort. Jagannath was then sentenced to a long period of imprisonment and obtained his release only in 1816. He was given a pension of Rs. 50 a month, and in 1822 Lord Amberst, with surprising generosity, restored him to the taluqa of Parsia.\n\nIn 1818 Ghazipur became a separate collectorate, the first officer placed in an independent charge being Mr. R. Barlow. The subsequent changes in the area and the transfers of territory between Azamgarh and Ghazipur have been mentioned in connection with the fiscal history. The latter comprises all that is of any importance in the annals of Ballia, and no incident worthy of record occurred in this district till the mutiny of 1857.\n\nBallia played but a small and unexciting part in the history of the great rebellion. The district had then no individuality of its own, and the events which are in any way connected with Ballia belong more properly to the annals of Azamgarh and Ghazipur. There was no military station within the limits of the present district, and no resident European officers; so that\nthere was no occasion for the massacre of the helpless or for the heroic defense maintained by a handful of devoted men against appalling odds, which have rendered the names of other districts familiar for all time. Moreover, while Azamgarh was lost and regained more than once, the possession of Ghazipur remained undisturbed throughout, and though for many months there was anarchy, the nominal administration of the district was preserved from first to last.\n\nSymptoms of disaffection soon became visible after the news of the Meerut outbreak had reached Ghazipur, and no reliance was placed on the 65th Native Infantry which garrisoned that place. The sepoys, however, showed no great disposition to rise, and indeed averred that they intended to remain faithful at least so long as the troops at Dinapore continued steadfast. Their behaviour contrasted strongly with that of the 17th Native Infantry at Azamgarh, one of the most notoriously disloyal of the company's regiments. The Ghazipur district, too, was fortunate in its officers, the collector being Mr. A. Ross, and the joint magistrate Mr. J. Bax, who was in charge of the Ballia subdivision. No vigorous measures were necessary during the month of May, but on the 1st of June news came of the ineffective mutiny and the disarmament of the Benares regiments, a proceeding which naturally caused much anxiety to the Ghazipur authorities. Matters were brought to a head by the mutiny of the Azamgarh regiment on the 3rd and the arrival at Ghazipur of the fugitives from their place. The district rapidly fell into a disorganized state and general anarchy for a time prevailed. The landholders and village communities whose rights had passed into the hands of auction-purchasers everywhere attempted to regain their ancestral holdings, while others turned to plunder, praying on their weaker neighbours, and the bolder spirits proceeded westwards to join the rebels in Oudh. The police were helpless, and though martial law was proclaimed it could not be enforced till the arrival of a hundred men of the 78th Highlanders from Benares. Their presence restored some degree of order, but the roads were no longer safe, and there were no means of checking the turbulent Rajputs of the Ballia parganas. On the 18th of July Mr. Venables, the well-known indigo planter,\nnassisted by Mr. Dunne, regained Azamgarh and managed to secure a number of refugees who had been in hiding in that district; but he soon found the position untenable and was compelled to retire, with the result that the whole district was abandoned except the Nagra tahsil. The latter, which is now included in Ballia, was in the charge of Maulvi Ali Hasan as tahsildar, and this man, together with the police officials, remained at his post throughout the disturbances.\n\nThe outlook at Ghazipur was rendered more uncertain by reason of the disturbed state of the country south of the Ganges. There Kunwar Singh, a connection of the Dumraon Raja, was in open rebellion, being at the head of his own clansmen and a large force of mutineers. He had virtually gained possession of the whole district of Shahabad, with the solitary exception of Arrah, where he met with unexpected and determined resistance from a small body of planters and Sikhs. The Government seat at Buxar also had remained untouched, and its retention was a matter of considerable importance. A small force was detailed to guard the place, but before its arrival Major Vincent Eyre came up in a steamer from Calcutta with a battery of artillery, and halted at Buxar on receiving news that the mutinied regiments from Dinapore were advancing to cross the Ganges. With the object of cutting them off he proceeded to Ghazipur on the 29th of July, leaving there an officer and two guns in exchange for 25 Highlanders. He then returned to Buxar, where he was met by Captain L'Estrange with 154 men of the 5th Fusiliers. Sending back the Highlanders to Ghazipur he himself marched to the relief of Arrah, obtaining considerable assistance in the matter of transport from the Raja of Dumraon, whom rumour had hitherto described as a rebel. The rescue of the Arrah garrison and the subsequent defeat of Kunwar Singh at Jagdispur enabled Eyre to proceed on his journey to Allahabad, and on the way to accomplish the very important task of disarming the 65th N. L at Ghazipur. This measure had long been anticipated, but the opportunity had hitherto been lacking; it caused great relief in the district, and enabled the town to be made fairly secure after the completion of an entrenched position at the opium factory.\nFor several months things remained comparatively quiet. In August the city of Azamgarh was occupied by the Gurkhas, and in the following month a severe blow was dealt to the rebels by Colonel Wroughton and the Nepalese. The country north of the Ghagra was kept in order by Colonel Rowcroft with another force of Gurkhas and the Pearl Naval Brigade, while the river was patrolled by a gunboat under the charge of the collector of Saran. The condition of affairs, however, underwent a complete change in March 1858. The bulk of the army was then concentrated at Lucknow and the eastern districts were almost denuded of troops. The opportunity was at once seized by Kunwar Singh, who crossed the Ganges and marched through the Ballia district into Azamgarh, where he was joined by other rebel contingents from the east of Fyzabad and the country beyond the Ghagra. He besieged the small force which held Azamgarh, but was driven off by General Lagard on the 16th of April. Though repulsed, Kunwar Singh was not beaten, and his troops retreated in good order to Nathupur near the western boundary of this district. The pursuit was at once taken up by Brigadier Douglas, who reached Nathupur on the 16th, and the next day came up with the retiring force at Naghai. Here Kunwar Singh had occupied a strong position, from which he was dislodged; but he conducted his retreat with great ability and on the 18th reached Nagra. The British cavalry continued the chase, but the infantry was too far behind to permit an assault. The same night Kunwar Singh retired to Sikandrapur and thence pushed on to Maniar. On receipt of this news Douglas hastened in hot pursuit, and at daylight on the 20th delivered his attack. While the infantry advanced under cover of a heavy artillery fire, the cavalry threatened the enemy on his right, with the result that the rebels fled in disorder, leaving on the field a gun and several wagons, an immense quantity of ammunition, a large amount of treasure, a number of carts and bullocks, and the colours of the 23rd N. I., which were found wrapped round the dead body of a native officer. The pursuit was maintained for six miles, but the rebels broke up into several columns and took different routes, only to reunite at a pre-arranged spot. Kunwar Singh had given out that in the absence of boats he would have to cross the Ganges\non elephants, but his actual intention was to effect the passage by means of a number of boats collected at Sheopurdiar, a short distance below Ballia. At the latter place there were two regiments of Mahras cavalry under Colonel Cumberlege, who had been deputed to cut off the retreat of the flying force; but astonishing to relate Kunwar Singh succeeded in embarking all save two hundred of his men before Douglas appeared with his troops, while the cavalry remained in blissful ignorance of the proceedings. As it was, the rebels left on the bank were cut off, and the last of the boats was sunk. The gunboat Megna took part in this action and, though this was not known till afterwards, by a lucky shot wounded Kunwar Singh, who not long afterwards died from the injury.\n\nThe good work done by Douglas was largely counteracted by the subsequent defeat of Captain Le Grand in the Shahabad district\u2014an event which threw the country on both sides of the Ganges into the utmost disorder. It had long been considered a most remarkable thing that Ballia had not risen before. Many of the mutineers had their homes in the district, while the tract was full of proclaimed offenders, and the eastern parganas had for years been notorious on account of the marauding bands of Dusadhs, whose traditional occupation was robbery and dacoity on the great waterways. Douglas was compelled to cross the Ganges in pursuit of Kunwar Singh, whose place was soon taken by his brothers, and consequently there were no troops available to maintain order, with the exception of the somewhat inactive column under Colonel Cumberlege. Though the sepoys had withdrawn to the jungles of Jagdispur, the whole of Ballia was given up to plundering parties, and throughout the district the wildest state of confusion prevailed. Little was attempted in the way of restoring order, and it was not till the middle of May that Mr. L. Probyn, who was now attached to the district, succeeded in persuading Cumberlege to attack the Kasniks of Baragunn without waiting for a siege train. When at length the force arrived, the place was found empty, and after destroying the houses of the more prominent insurgents the troops returned to Ghazipur. Matters continued in the same state till July, when Mr. Bax marched out to Ballia with a small force. The\nrebels had broken down a bridge on the road, but the party met with no opposition, and Ballia was occupied by Sikh troops under Mr. Probun. The remainder of the party continued their journey to Bairia, where they were besieged for several days by a large force of mutineers from the north-west. The latter, finding their efforts ineffectual, then turned towards Ballia in hopes of surprising the town, but the assault came to nought and soon they were driven northwards by the advance of Brigadier Douglas. From that time the district gradually settled down, though the country continued to be disturbed till the advent of the cold weather, when Douglas finally crushed the followers of Kunwar Singh in the Kaimur hills, and the country to the north was cleared preparatory to Lord Clyde's great combined movement on Oudh.\n\nAs in many districts, so in Ballia, did the rebellion bring to light several conspicuous instances of steadfast loyalty. First and foremost came the Raja of Haldi and the members of his family, who, in spite of strong inducements to join the rebels, exerted all their influence in favour of the British and set an excellent example; the Raja was too poor to take any active part in repressing the rebellion beyond saving the lives of a few policemen, but his attitude had a great effect on the people of Ballia. The reward recommended by the Commissioner of Benares was the restoration of the malikana allowance enjoyed by his ancestors, but this was disallowed, and the Raja was given two small villages in Doaba, the only confiscated property that was available, and a life pension of Rs. 2,500 per annum. The Maharaja of Dumraon, whose loyalty in protecting Government property and in furnishing supplies, exposed him to great private loss and personal danger, was adequately rewarded by the Government of Bengal, the province in which he resided. His dependants, Raghunandan Prasad Pande of Bairia, Gur Prasad of Srinagar and Thakur Singh of Dukti, assisted in maintaining order among the turbulent inhabitants of Doaba and received acknowledgments of their services. So also did the zamindars of Bansthana, Anjorpur, Tajpur, Gangauli and elsewhere in pargana Ballia. Muhammad Abd-ur-Rahman, the munshi of Ballia, made himself useful by collecting the retainers of the loyal\nlandholders and subduing all attempts at revolt till the incursion of Kunwar Singh, and was rewarded by a grant of land. The Begams of Sonwani also remained loyal throughout, guarding the public offices and supplying information to the authorities, their conduct resulting in an attack upon their houses, from which they escaped with difficulty. In the Rasra tahsil the Sengars of Lakhnoor and the Kansiks of Kopachit were rebels almost to a man; but Gopal Singh, the head of the Ratsand family of Karholias, materially assisted in the defence of Rasra under Mr. Probyn, as also did Kishan Kunwar, the agent of the family of Deokinandan Singh. Ratsand was in consequence burnt and plundered, while Gopal Singh was rewarded by a gift of money and a small grant of land; Kishan Kunwar was afterwards killed by the rebels, and the reward in his case was bestowed on his son. In the Azamgarh parganas the loyalists were chiefly Government servants, such as Maulvi Ali Hasan, the tahsildar of Nagra and Abdul Majid, the mansif; these men remained at their posts, though Azamgarh was twice abandoned, and took active measures against the rebels, preventing Muhammad Hasan, the Nazim of Gorakhpur, from crossing the Ghagra and defeating some of his troops at Turtipar. The tahsildar was rewarded with a handsome khilat and confiscated land assessed at Rs. 2,500, while the mansif obtained a grant of land with a revenue demand of Rs. 750. Pangu Singh, head of the Nagra Rai, assisted the officials materially, saving the records and treasure from the Sigauli mutineers, collecting a large body of men to defend the passage of the Ghagra, and taking an active part in the pursuit of Kunwar Singh. His conduct received the approbation of Government, and was further recognised by the pardon of his father and uncle, who had been condemned for murder and implication in the rebellion.\n\nFrom the restoration of order at the end of 1858 to the present day the peace of Ballia has but once been broken. In 1896 the district was troubled by the garvakhshini movement, which arose from a widespread conspiracy on the part of the Hindus to prevent the slaughter of kine by Musalmans. Matters came to a head at Mau in Amangarh, close to the borders of this district, that place containing an unusually large proportion\nof Julahas, the most fanatical and turbulent section of the Musalman community. A serious riot ensued, and the infection rapidly spread into Ballia. Several bands from this district were afterwards proved to have taken part in the disturbance at Mau, and subsequently the same people were responsible for the sporadic outbreaks at Baheri, Qazipur, Eksura and Baragon in the Ubhaon police circle. No actual military operations proved necessary, however, and the needs of the situation were adequately met by quartering a large force of punitive police in the circles of Haldharpur, Rasra, Ubhaon, Sikandarpur, Garwar, Banadih, Ballia and Nagra. The other events worthy of record have been dealt with elsewhere. The chief occurrence is of course the formation of the district of Ballia in 1879, together with the various additions and exchanges of territory that have since taken place. Reference has also been made to the temporary transfer of the district headquarters to Korantadib, to the rebuilding of Ballia, and to the revision of records by Mr. D. T. Roberts, the distinguished officer whose association with the district will long be remembered.\nGAZETTEER\nOF\nBALLIA.\nDIRECTORY.\nGAZETTEER OF BALLIA.\n\nDIRECTORY\n\nCONTENTS\n\n| Location                  | Page |\n|---------------------------|------|\n| Agranli                   | 163  |\n| Balanagar                 | 193  |\n| Bariya                    | 164  |\n| Ballia                    | 105  |\n| Ballia Pargana            | 171  |\n| Ballia Tehsil             | 176  |\n| Banadhi                   | 178  |\n| Banadhi Tehsil            | 180  |\n| Tharpagan                 | 183  |\n| Banapar                   | 184  |\n| Bhadaur Pargana           | 185  |\n| Bhilai                    | 187  |\n| Bhilai Tehsil             | 188  |\n| Chakla                    | 189  |\n| Chand Darya               | 190  |\n| Chandipur                 | 190  |\n| Chhata                    | 190  |\n| Chikkaler                 | 191  |\n| Chittapur                 | 191  |\n| Deoja Pargana             | 191  |\n| Dula Behra                | 191  |\n| Duni                     | 197  |\n| Gaighat                   | 199  |\n| Garhia Pargana            | 198  |\n| Garwar                    | 201  |\n| Hajnali                   | 202  |\n| Halidpur                  | 203  |\n| Haldi                     | 203  |\n| Haldi Tehsil              | 204  |\n| Hazinagar                 | 205  |\n| Hazinabad                 | 206  |\n| Jauhi                     | 206  |\n| Karamgar                  | 207  |\n| Karnal                    | 207  |\n| Karol                     | 208  |\n| Kathura                   | 209  |\n| Khajuri                   | 210  |\n| Khaironi                  | 210  |\n| Khairul                   | 211  |\n| Khairul Pargana           | 213  |\n| Kharsana                  | 217  |\n| Kopachhi East Pargana     | 217  |\n| Kopachhi West Pargana     | 221  |\n| Korwa                     | 224  |\n| Lakhnawar                  | 225  |\n| Lakhnawar Pargana         | 225  |\n| Mairitar                  | 231  |\n| Majhawa                   | 233  |\n| Maniar                    | 234  |\n| Mirji Chhapra             | 236  |\n| Nagpara                   | 236  |\n| Nagro                     | 237  |\n| Nagra                     | 238  |\n| Narainpur                 | 239  |\n| Nathi                     | 239  |\n| Pakri                     | 240  |\n| Pharsar                   | 240  |\n| Phopna                    | 241  |\n| Pat                       | 241  |\n| Bara                      | 242  |\n| Baera Tehsil              | 244  |\n| Batampura                 | 247  |\n| Batund                     | 247  |\n| Boor                      | 247  |\n| Sahaswar                  | 249  |\n| Sariya                    | 250  |\n| Sheopurdiar               | 251  |\n| Sikandarpur               | 252  |\n| Sikandarpur East Pargana  | 254  |\n| Sikandarpur West Pargana  | 255  |\n| Sohbara                   | 255  |\n| Sonwani                   | 255  |\n| Sringar                   | 256  |\n| Sukhpara                  | 256  |\n| Surendranagar             | 256  |\n| Tari Baragon              | 256  |\n| Tika Deori                | 256  |\n| Turtipar                  | 256  |\n| Uthana                    | 257  |\nAGRAULI, Pargana and Tahsil Ballia.\n\nThis is one of the many large villages in the south of the pargana, occupying part of the recently formed alluvial land in the large bend of the Ganges to the south-east of Ballia. It stands in $25^\\circ 42' N.$ and $84^\\circ 15' E.$, at a distance of some seven miles from the district headquarters. The lands of Agrauli, which cover 1,456 acres and are assessed at Rs. 3,042, adjoin those of Jauhi on the south, Bhalsand on the north and Sheopur-diar on the west, all of these places being separately mentioned. The village was settled in 1790 with Dubo Brahmans, and is still in the possession of their descendants, with the exception of a small share purchased many years ago by the Pandes of Bairia. This share, which brings in an annual net profit of about Rs. 220, was granted in 1885 by Babu Raghunandan Prasad Pande as an endowment for a Sanskrit teachership at Ballia, and is now managed as a Benevolent Trust. Save for the number of its inhabitants, Agrauli is of little importance. It possesses an upper primary school and an insignificant bazar; the only manufacture is that of country cloth, for the production of which there are ten looms. The population at the last census numbered 2,547 persons, of whom all but 66 were Hindus, the great majority being Brahmans.\n\nBAHAURA, Pargana Doaba, Tahsil Ballia.\n\nThis village lies in $25^\\circ 43' N.$ and $84^\\circ 28' E.$, at a distance of some 22 miles from the district headquarters, and about three miles south of Bairia, on a road leading from the latter place to Lalganj and the Damodarpur ferry over the Ganges. The lands are of an alluvial nature and are liable to vary in extent from year to year. It has a very large population, which numbered 4,529 in 1881 and 4,755 ten years later, while in 1901 the total was 4,838, of whom 128 were Musalmans. Many of the inhabitants reside in chappars or temporary huts, which they erect near\ntheir fields while the crops are on the ground, retiring to higher ground during the rains. The village, which is included in the Damodarpur taluka, now belongs to the Dumraon estate, but formerly it was held by Lohatamia Rajputs, the remains of whose fort are still to be seen on an old mound to the south of the village. The prevailing castes at present are Lohatamias, Brahmins, Bhuinhar and Ahirs. Apart from its size, Bahauna is of little note: there is a bazar in Sripalpur, a hamlet to the north, where a considerable trade in cattle is carried on, and a large upper primary school in Bhusaula, an adjoining site to the south.\n\nBAIRIA, Pargana DOARA, Tehsil BALLIA.\n\nBairia is the chief town of the pargana, and stands in 25\u00b0 46' N. and 84\u00b0 29' E., at a distance of 20 miles from Ballia and about four miles south of Suremanpur railway station. It is connected with both these places by unmetalled roads, while others lead to Chand Diara and Revalganj on the east, to the Damodarpur ferry over the Ganges on the south, and to Beoti and Bansdih on the north-west. The main site is built on the north side of the Ballia and Revalganj road, and consists of little more than a congeries of mud houses, with a few more substantial structures. The site covers about 104 acres and is traversed by a good street from east to west and by the new road to the railway station running north and south through the town. The population of the place rose from 6,177 in 1853 to 6,766 in 1865, to 7,162 in 1872 and to 9,160 in 1881. It dropped at the following census to 8,479, while in 1901 Bairia contained 8,635 inhabitants, of whom 1,119 were Musalmans. The prevailing castes are Koeris and Rajputs. The latter are mainly of the Lohatami clan, and their ancestors at the permanent settlement were the solo owners of the place. It has since passed out of their possession, together with the rest of their estates. One-sixth is held by the Maharani of Dumraon, one-fourth by the Bhuinhar Pandas, who are the principal residents and were formerly agents to Dumraon, and the rest by a Mahajan of Saran. The total area of the manza of Bairia is 2,346 acres and the revenue demand Rs. 3,480.\n\nThe town does not figure in history, and is said to have grown out of a mere hamlet founded by and named after one\nBairi of the Hind caste. It acquired importance gradually as a market, and also from its comparatively secure position. There is but little import trade, but the exports are considerable, chiefly in the shape of sugar and coarse cloth. The former is now, however, of little importance, only two refineries remaining out of twenty that existed a few years ago. No fewer than 300 looms are at work, belonging to the Julahas of the place, and the cotton fabrics go for the most part to Lower Bengal. Shoes are made by the Chamars and exported to Chapra, Ghazipur, Duxar and other places, while large numbers are sold in the surrounding villages. The town derives its supplies of grain, piece-goods and other necessaries from the large bazar of Raniganj, owned by the Dumraon estate and situated in the village of Kotwa, two miles to the north, this market being the chief trade centre for the whole pargana. In Bairia markets are held in the bazar four days in each week. The public institutions of the town include the police-station, with a good masonry building, the post-office, a cattle-pound, a mud-built saras and a middle vernacular school, housed in a substantial building. The largest edifice in Bairia is the house of the Paudes, standing on a raised foundation, which renders it a conspicuous object from every side, though of no architectural merit. In Sonbaria, a mile to the east, is the dispensary known as the Roberts hospital.\n\nThe town is subject to the provisions of Act XX of 1856, which has been in force since 1873. There were 1,500 houses in the place in 1906, and of these 903 were assessed to taxation. The average income from the house-tax for the preceding three years was Rs. 1,165, which gave an incidence of Re. 1-2-10 per assessed house and Re. 0-2-1 per head of population. The total receipts from all sources, including the opening balance, was Rs. 1,422 for the same period, and the expenditure Rs. 1,166. The principal items were Rs. 648 for the upkeep of the local police force, Rs. 186 for the maintenance of the conservancy staff, and Rs. 148 for local public improvements.\n\nBALLIA, Pargana and Tehsil BALLIA.\n\nThe place which gives its name to the district is a fair-sized town lying on the banks of the Ganges in 25\u00b0 44' N. and 84\u00b0 10' E.,\nat a distance of 42 miles east from Ghazipur, 21 miles from Rasra and ten miles from Bansdih. Metalled roads connect it with Ghazipur and the two other tahsils of this district, and also with Hanumanganj on the road to Sikandarpur; while unmetalled roads run north-east to Sahatwar, and east to Haldi and Batia.\n\nThe branch line of the Bengal and North-Western Railway from Benares and Ghazipur to Chand Diarn passes to the north of the town, with a branch leading to Man on the north-west; prior to its construction the nearest station was at Durnaon on the East Indian Railway, 13 miles to the south, and only accessible by means of a ferry over the Ganges and a very indifferent road, which is generally impassable for wheeled traffic during the rains.\n\nThe population of Ballia as enumerated on different occasions has exhibited great fluctuations during the past fifty years; but the figures are almost useless for the purposes of comparison, as the area has varied so greatly with the changes both of the Ganges and of the municipal boundaries. In 1853 the number of inhabitants was 8,288, and this rose to 10,829 in 1865, but fell in 1872 to 8,521. In 1881 the population residing within municipal limits was 15,320, and ten years later it was 16,372. At the last census of 1901 the place contained 15,278 persons, of whom 7,000 were females. Classified by religions, there were 12,071 Hindus, 2,024 Musalmans, 5 Christians and 268 others, chiefly Sikhs and Aryas. Since the census the area has been further extended, resulting in an increase of the population; but the dominant factor is the Ganges, which has played so important a part in the annals of the town.\n\nThe origin of the name has long been a matter of dispute. The local derivation is from Balmik or Valmiki, the celebrated Hindu poet, whose residence here was commemorated, it is said, by a shrine which has long been washed away. It is, however, equally probable that the word merely means sandy, and in that case the parable of the house built on the sand might be quoted with much aptitude. The place is doubtless of great antiquity, as the many legends bear witness, and some have identified Ballia with the site of the Buddhist temple of the Vast Solitude, mentioned by the Chinese pilgrims. The confluence of the Ganges with the\nSarju gave it peculiar sanctity in the eyes of Hindus, and made it the scene of great assemblages which are maintained to this day in the form of the Dadri fair. At one time the noted ascetic Bhirug, a son of Brahma, dwelt here, and his temple, known as Bhirugasram, marked the holy spot till it was carried away by the river. The existing shrine is the third at least of that name, and stands further inland than its predecessors, near the Dharmavanya tank, an ancient excavation where thousands of Rishis are said to have performed their yoga. It would seem that the earliest temple marked a former confluence to the south-east of the town, whereas now the waters of the two rivers unite near Bansthana some distance to the west of Ballia; but the fair continues to be held as near as possible to the old site, on the sandy stretches by the river. Some account of the gathering has already been given in Chapter II.\n\nIt appears that formerly the Ganges flowed at a considerable distance to the south of its present course. There is a long jhil near Bhojpur, a few miles from Dumraon, and fully ten miles south of Ballia, which evidently marks the course taken by the main stream long ago. Bhojpur too stands on a high cliff that clearly represents the old flood bank, and similar traces of a former but later course exist at Niazipur five miles south of Ballia; while between these two places is a wide expanse of sand indicating more recent ravages on the part of the stream. In 1849 at any rate the town of Ballia was at a safe distance from the river, the main site standing on land which is now on the Shalabad side. The Katihar nala, which flows along the western outskirts of the town, then joined the Sarju, the latter falling into the Ganges some miles to the south-east; whereas now the junction is two miles or more to the west, and the Katihar flows directly into the Ganges. The old town was a little place on the north bank of the Sarju or Tons, and stood on the lands of Tajpur, Turk Balia, Bijapur and Qazipur, which gave their names to the four mohallas. It was first seriously threatened about 1873, and in the ensuing four years all the better portion was swept away, in spite of the efforts made to control the current. By 1877 the stream had advanced within 500 yards of the tahsil buildings and the district courts, but in that year the movement was\nchecked and no further action seemed imminent. The English school, the dispensary and the old mosque had been destroyed, and new sites for the school and hospital were selected to the north of the new town. No vestige of old Ballia now remains, and even the villages on which it stood have disappeared, save for small fragments of Rijaipur and Bankata, a hamlet of Qasipur. The result of this erosion was a general migration of the inhabitants northwards, so that a new town sprang up at a safer distance from the river. It was built in the shape of a quadrangle, with the longer side resting on the Bairia road, which was lined with houses for a length of nearly two miles. In the middle of the town is a handsome masonry bazar of a circular form known as Robertganj. This gave its name to a mohalla of the new town, the others being Satiwara, Bhirugaram and Makhulumhi, the last being called after a Musalman saint named Makhulum Shah who is said to have been the first settler.\n\nBefore long this new town also began to be threatened by the continued tendency towards a more northerly course on the part of the Ganges. Between 1883 and 1889 erosion was gradual, but the bank had receded by 364 feet; and from that time the process became more rapid, 135 feet going in 1890, and in the next three years 1,000 feet were washed away. The tahsil buildings were carried away, and the destruction of the district offices, which stood near the junction of the Bairia and Hammanganj roads, seemed imminent. It was then resolved to move the headquarters from Ballia to a safer situation, and eventually Korantavlih was selected; the courts and offices were dismantled, and the transfer took place on the 8th of April 1894. This move was, however, of a partial nature only. The tahsil and the munshi's court remained at Ballia, being located in the collector's house; the dispensary and high school were undisturbed; and a joint magistrate continued in residence here for the public convenience of the district generally, as the new headquarters lay in the extreme south-western corner of the tract. As early as 1895 it was noticed that new alluvium was forming at Tarapur to the west, and this indicated a tendency on the part of the river to shift to the opposite side, but for a time nothing was done, as the main stream still flowed immediately under the town. In 1896 it was found that the old\ncatcherry was yet untouched, and the question of restoring Ballia to its former position was once more considered. It appeared that the existence of a karakar reef at the present junction of the Kakebar and Ganges was a sufficient safeguard against much further erosion, and was likely to turn the river more towards Shampooor than against Ballia. A new site for the civil station was selected to the north of the railway, and in 1897 an area of some 240 acres was taken up for the purpose. The buildings were for the most part completed by the beginning of 1901, and the headquarters were moved again to Ballia on the 25th of March in that year. For a time the Ganges remained comparatively stable, but in 1904 further erosion became imminent, and a large section of the population was compelled to abandon their homes. In order to provide accommodation a fresh site was chosen immediately to the south of the railway station, comprising 123 acres in the villages of Bishnupur, Jagdispur, Bidua, Medua and Middhi. A rectangular chawk was built in the centre, and a rowel was made to connect it with the station on the north and with Robertganj on the south. Several other roads, intended to serve as main arteries of traffic for the new town, and connected with each other by cross roads, radiate from the central chawk; in the middle of the latter is a well, surrounded by an enclosed space, intersected by pathways. A system of drainage is being carried out, and trees have been planted along all the roads. The area has been divided up into sites, which are regularly leased for building purposes. The place has as yet a somewhat empty appearance; though numerous sites have been taken up, and houses have been built or are being built in fair numbers, the town as a whole is far from densely populated, and there are many spaces still awaiting occupation.\n\nThe civil station extends northwards from the railway, along which are the quarters of the railway staff, on either side of the Hammanganj road. To the south are the opium bungalow and the old cemetery and opposite them are the sessions house and the municipal and district board's offices. North of the latter stand the engineer's office and the courts and treasury; while to the west of the road are the residences of the collector, joint magistrate and superintendent of police, as well as the\nclub. The station, which is surrounded by a good road, also contains the tahsil buildings, the munsif's court, and residences for the chief subordinate officials.\n\nThe other public buildings are for the most part along the Hamumanganj road south of the railway. They comprise the inspection bungalow, the dispensary, the police hospital, the post-office, the police lines; jail and the Kotwali police-station, and the old collector's bungalow, now occupied by the civil surgeon. Land on both sides of this road has been acquired by the municipality, to prevent the growth of undesirable bazars and hostis. In addition to the high school which remains on its old site, there are seven aided schools, and two Sanskrit pathshalas, as well as the tahsil vernacular middle school.\n\nThe trade and manufactures of Ballia are of little importance. The latter consist mainly of coarse cloth, turned out by about forty looms, sugar, saltpetre, iron and brass utensils. Sugar is collected from the neighbouring villages, and exported to Agra, Calcutta and elsewhere, while other exports include ghi and oilseeds. The chief imports are rice, which comes in large quantities from Gorakhpur and Lower Bengal, and cloth from Calcutta and Gharipur. The Dadri fair, already mentioned, is the scene of great commercial activity, and largely contributes towards the prosperity of the town.\n\nBallia was in 1860 brought under the operations of Act XX of 1858, but in November 1871 it was raised to the status of a municipality. Its affairs are managed by a board of ten members, including the magistrate as chairman. The income is derived mainly from a tax according to circumstance and property, this being largely supplemented by the surplus proceeds from the Dadri fair. The details of income and expenditure for each year since 1890 will be found in the appendix.* In addition to the mohallas mentioned above, the municipal area includes the villages of Bijaipur, Tola Guru Narayan, Chandanpur, Wairapur, Muninath, Naupah, Bidna, Harpur and its hamlets known as Qasipura, Tola Lachhmi Prasad and Chhapra Bahar Khan, Ramaipur, Pachhohrn, Kanapur, Midthi, Bishnipur, Jagdishpur, Neori Yarpur, Rampur Udailban, Harpur Chandrabhan,\n\n* Appendix, Table XVI.\nMadhopur, and the hamlet of Chhapra Basant Pande. Many of these villages were added when the new civil-station was built, while on the other hand many, such as Bijaipur and Wasirapur, have been extensively diluviated.\n\n**BALLIA Pargana, Tahsil BALLIA.**\n\nThis is the central pargana of the headquarters tahsil, and the largest of the four that make up that subdivision. It is bounded on the west by Kopsahit East and for a short distance by Garha, on the north by pargana Kharid of the Bansdih tahsil, on the east by Doula, and on the south by the Ganges, beyond which lies the Shahabad district of Bengal. In shape it resembles a rectangle with an extremely irregular southern boundary. The Ganges at present flows along its borders with two great bands northwards, leaving a deep and broad promontory in between, extending some miles south of the village of Jauhi. The periodical variations in the course of the river are extraordinarily great, so that the total area varies from time to time to a considerable extent, though loss in one place is usually compensated by gain in another. In 1906 it amounted to 116,581 acres or 182 square miles, while for the preceding five years the figure was 116,344 acres, and in 1881 the returns showed a total of 178-9 square miles.\n\nThe pargana is the most densely populated and at the same time the most fertile in the district. The greater portion resembles Doula, and is composed of more or less recent alluvium, the surface being nearly level, though in most cases the bank of the Ganges is somewhat higher than the land in the interior. The result of this is illustrated by the periodical flooding which occurs in taluka Ser, and which is due not only to the fact that the jhils when swollen by the rains have no longer a natural outlet, but also to the overflow from the river which inundates the depression. Another instance is afforded by the Katehar, which normally carries off the surplus waters of the Surnha Tal, flowing from north to south and joining the Ganges a little west of Ballia town. When the great river is in flood, however, its waters pour into the channels of the Katehar, submerging the country on its banks, and contributing a greater volume to the Surnha.\nTal than is received by the lake in the form of drainage from the surrounding country. The Sarju on the other hand is not liable to such action; it flows down from the upland tract in a deep bed, traversing the extreme south-western corner of the pargana, and at present uniting with the Ganges near Bansthana, some three miles west of Ballia. While a considerable proportion of the pargana is subject to annual inundation and the consequent changes of boundary and configuration, the northern and western parts are higher and comparatively free from floods. The tract adjoining pargana Kopashit properly belongs to the uplands of the district, while to the east of the Sarhua Tal there is a small block forming a continuation of the upland portion of Kharid. Between these uplands and the river bank the country is comparatively ancient alluvium, although this fact does not necessarily protect it from the Ganges, which washed away the old town of Ballia and obliterated its site which had been inhabited for centuries. The soil of the pargana is for the most part a fertile and consistent loam, while on the higher ground it is lighter, and in the depressions it stiffens into a strong clay. Along the Ganges there are several stretches of sand, sometimes covered with coarse grass and tamarisk, but as a rule the deposit left by the river is of a very rich description.\n\nThe excellence of the pargana is shown by the high general state of development. For the five years ending in 1906 the average area under cultivation was 86,072 acres or 74 per cent. of the whole pargana, a proportion which is only exceeded in Garha and Kopashit East. The cultivable area averages 11,358 acres or 10-3 per cent., but from this there should properly be made a deduction of 8,837 acres of groves and some 2,500 acres of new fallow; this leaves a very small proportion available for fresh cultivation, and much of this even is of little value, except perhaps as grazing land. The barren area comprises 18,913 acres, of which 6,009 acres are under water and 5,120 acres occupied by roads, railways, village sites and buildings. There is but little irrigation, for little is ordinarily required, except in the upland tract and in the case of garden crops, which are watered from both masonry and small temporary wells. The average area irrigated is 13-8 per cent. of the cultivation, and\nalmost the whole of this is supplied from wells, the number of which could be largely increased in time of drought. As in Doaba, the rabi is by far the more important harvest, owing to the annual floods; the average area sown is 66,377 acres in the rabi and 47,291 acres in the kharif. The chief staples grown in the former are wheat, which alone and in combination occupies 23-3 per cent. of the area; barley, 22-0 per cent.; gram, either sown alone or with barley, 20-1 percent.; and peas, 12-1 per cent.\n\nThere is a fair amount of opium cultivation, which covers on an average 400 acres. In the kharif maize predominates, constituting 38-2 per cent. of the harvest, and after this come rice with 14-2 per cent., kodon with 11-7 per cent. and sugarcane with 6-2 per cent., the rest consisting mainly in arhar and bajra. The double-cropped area is unusually large, averaging 53 per cent. of the net cultivation, this figure being only exceeded in Doaba and Garha, in either of which very similar conditions prevail.\n\nAmong the cultivators Brahmans and Rajputs preponderate, and next come Ahirs, Koeris, Kuhars, Bhulnurs and Chamars. The higher castes usually employ hired labour, but on the whole the standard of husbandry is superior to that of any other pargana, and both proprietors and tenants are for the most part in prosperous circumstances. At the present time 22 per cent. of the land is included in proprietary cultivation, either as sir or khudkash; 38 per cent. is held by tenants at fixed rates, 23 per cent. by occupancy tenants, and only nine per cent. by tenants-at-will, the remainder being rent-free. As much as 25 per cent. is sublet, chiefly in the proprietary and fixed rate areas. There are no separate returns for ganvadadars, who are very numerous in this pargana, and though in former days they were classed as occupancy tenants, they more closely resemble samindars; some account of this tenure has already been given in chapter III. A large number of the tenants are also samindars, their proprietary holdings being either in other villages or in other parts of the same village. The average rent-rate for sub-tenants is now Rs. 12-12-3 per acre, this figure being only exceeded in Doaba. Tenants at fixed rates pay Rs. 4-1-10, occupancy tenants Rs. 4-12-9, and tenants-at-will Rs. 5-7-9 per acre.\nThe revenue demand in 1906 is shown in the appendix.* It then amounted to Rs. 1,53,413, to which may be added Rs. 14,516 on account of acreage rate and Rs. 2,448 for other cesses. There are altogether 394 villages divided at present into 1,193 mahals, of which all save two are permanently settled. The prevailing form of tenure is joint zamindari, which occurs in 722 mahals, while of the rest single zamindari is found in 211, perfect pattidari in 95, imperfect pattidari in 123, and bharyachara in ten mahals. Of the various proprietary castes Rajputs own 72 per cent. of the land; Brahmans 11.5 per cent.; Ilminhars seven percent.; Kayasthas 1.7 per cent.; Musalmans one per cent.; and other Hindus the remainder. The chief landowners include the Maharani of Dumraon, the Maharaja of Vizianagram, the Hon'ble Munshi Madho Lal of Benares, and the Bania family of Hanumanganj and Ballia.\n\nIn the same connection some mention may be made of the various subdivisions of the pargana and their owners. These subdivisions are here known as taluqas and are of very varying size and value. In former days almost all the land belonged to the Hayobans, as the head of whom was the Raja of Haldi, but with a few exceptions their possessions have passed into other hands and the Raja himself now has no land in the pargana. The Haldi taluka of 24 villages is now owned by the Dumraon estate, as also are the 28 villages of Karnai, the nine villages of Gaighat, the 16 villages of Dighar, and the greater portion of Bigahi, as well as shares in several others. The Sonwani taluka, comprising 9,901 acres revenue-free, is held by the Maharaja of Vizianagram, who purchased from the Musalman family, of which an account has been given in chapter III. The large alluvial taluka of Shoopurdiar belongs to Ujjain Rajputs who are connected with the Dumraon family. Zirabasti, formerly held by Hayobans, is now the property of the Hammanganj mahajans, who have also acquired most of Gopalpur, another Hayoban estate of five villages. The Hayobans still retain the greater portion of Takaramud, nine villages; Jamuan, 15 villages; and the seven villages of Repura, though Kayastha and Kalwars have purchased an important share in Jamuan. Durjanpur, an estate of\n\n* Appendix, Table X.\n27 villages, was settled with Hayobans, and was afterwards sold, the present proprietors being Brahmans, Rajputs of different clans, Bhoinsurs and Kayastha. The taluqas of Ser and Rohnapur were in old days the property of Kinwara, and are now mainly owned by Manshi Malho Lal. The Kinwars retain Chhata, a rich estate of 62 villages. The Basantpur taluka of five villages, important from the fact of its including the Suraha Tal, is owned by Donwar Rajputs, who also possess the Middha Dumri taluka of 13 villages. Of the remaining taluqas, Thamhanpura, which is composed of four villages, belongs mainly to a large community of Brahmans; Janari, also of four villages, was sold by the Raja of Haldi and is now held by Kalwars and others; and Ambari, seven villages, is the property of Sheikhs, whose ancestors obtained the permanent settlement.\n\nAt the census of 1872 the pargana had a population of 152,045, but this was probably incorrect, as in 1881 the total had risen to 197,791. Ten years later there was a further increase to 201,570, but since that time it has remained stationary, the number of inhabitants in 1901 being 200,124, of whom 186,014 were Hindus, 18,829 Musalmans and 281 of other religions. The only town in the pargana is that of Ballia itself, but there are many villages with large populations. Among the most prominent of these are Hakli, Shapurdar, Bhalsand, Jauhi, Chhata, Basantpur, Nagwa, Karnai and Hanumanganj, each of which forms the subject of a separate article. Means of communication are afforded both by the railway and by numerous roads. The former enters the pargana near Phophna, and after reaching Ballia turns north-east to Gharnuli, near which is the Bansdih Road station, thence continuing towards Sahatwar. Metalled roads run from Ballia to Ghasipur and Bansdih, a branch from the former leading to Rasra, while the road to Sikandarpur is metalled as far as Hanumanganj. Of the unmetalled roads the chief are those leading from Ballia to Haldi and Bairia, to Sahatwar and Roisi, and to Jauhi, while another connects Haldi with Sahatwar.\n\nThe history of the pargana is mainly that of the district as a whole. The aboriginal Cherus are said to have been ousted by the Hayobans and other Rajputs, who held the tract under the Raja of Haldi till the latter was ejected by Balwant Singh of\nBenares in 1760. The management was then entrusted to an amil, and at the permanent settlement about 16,000 acres were given to the Raja of Haldi and the remainder settled with the village headmen or magaddams. Although it was expressly laid down that these magaddam tenures should be considered equally permanent and liable to the same conditions as those of zamindars, a general belief prevailed up to 1840 that they were of a somewhat different nature; but in the revision of that year even the nominal distinction was dropped, and the Raja of Haldi was compelled to abandon any hopes he might have retained of regaining his old position in the pargana.\n\nBALLIA Tahsil.\n\nThis is the southern subdivision of the district, being made up of the four parganas of Ballia, Doaba, Kopsahit East, and Garha, each of which forms the subject of a separate article. It is of very irregular shape, being a long and narrow stretch of country, except in the extreme west, where it broadens out to a width of some 20 miles, while to the east the breadth from north to south is barely three miles; the extreme length from east to west is about 42 miles. The tahsil is bounded on the north by Banadih, on the east by the Ghagra, which separates it from the Saran district, on the west by pargana Kopsahit West and the Muhammadabad tahsil of Ghazipur, and on the south by the Ganges, beyond which lies the district of Shahabad. In consequence of the vagaries of the latter river the area is at all times liable to change, though the net variation is comparatively small, losses in one direction being usually compensated by additions elsewhere. The total area taking the average for the five years ending in 1906 was 285,875 acres or 446.7 square miles, of which 207,644 acres were cultivated, the proportion ranging from 65.3 per cent. in Doaba to no less than 82.7 per cent. in Garha, the latter figure being exceeded in no other portion of the district.\n\nThe whole of pargana Doaba and the greater part of Ballia and Garha are included in the alluvial tract of the Ganges, while Kopsahit East and a narrow stretch of country in the west and north of Ballia belong to the upland formation. The drainage of the latter is effected by the Sarju, and its tributaries\nthe Mangai and the Budhi, while further east it falls into the great lake known as the Saraha Tal. The overflow from this lake passes into the Ganges by the Katchar, though in times of flood the action is frequently reversed. There is a tract with defective drainage in pargana Ballia, of which mention has been made in chapter I. As a whole, the tahsil is the most fertile in the district, and in spite of the inundations of the Ganges it is less liable to deterioration than other parts.\n\nFor administrative purposes it forms a subdivision in the charge of a full-powered officer on the district staff. There is a tahsildar with headquarters at Ballia, while at the present time Babu Padam Deo Narayan Singh of Bairia is an honorary magistrate of the third class for the Bairia and Rooti police circles, and Babu Rajendra Pratap Narayan Singh has similar powers in the Halidi. The civil jurisdiction in the pargana of Ballia and Doaba is included in that of the Ballia munsif, while pargana Garha belongs to the munsif of Muhammadabad in Ghasipur, and Kopaidit East to the munsif of Rauna. Under the present arrangements there are police-stations at Ballia, Halidi, Bairia, Garwar and Korantadih, but under the new scheme several modifications are likely to be introduced, the Halidi station being abolished and the circle divided between those of Ballia, Rooti and Bairia; while that of Korantadih will be moved to Narihi and an outpost left in its place; and the two outposts at Phosphna and at Tola Siwan in pargana Doaba will be retained.\n\nWhen the census of 1881 was taken the tahsil had not yet assumed its present form, for the Garha pargana was still included in the Ghasipur district. The approximate figure for the existing area at that enumeration was 383,528, though this does not take into account a few detached villages subsequently added. In 1891 the tahsil contained 406,151 inhabitants, and this had dropped at the following census to 405,823, of whom 215,528 were females. Classified according to religions, there were 382,204 Hindus, 23,101 Musalmans, 273 Sikhs, 27 Christians, 15 Aryas and three Jains. Among the various Hindu castes Brahmans take the lead with 61,793 representatives, and then come Rajputs, 52,919. The latter belong to a great variety of clans, among the most prominent of which are the Hayobans,\nKarcholia, Kausik, Gautam, Bais, Chandol and Bisau. Next come Ahirs, 44,247; Chamars, 28,845; Koeris, 25,276; Bhulnars, 21,532, chiefly in pargana Garha; and Banias, 18,341, two-thirds of them belonging to the Kandu subdivision. The majority of the Musalmans belong to the Julaia caste, of whom there were 14,225. The tahsil is mainly agricultural, and according to the census returns 67 per cent. of the people were directly dependent on cultivation, while another nine per cent. were employed as general labourers. The chief industries, other than those connected with the supply of food and drink, are cotton weaving, and the manufacture of oil, sugar, saltpetre and metal vessels. The chief towns of the tahsil are Ballia, Bairia and Baragaon. Apart from these there are many large villages, to which reference will be found in the various pargana articles.\n\nMeans of communication have been immensely improved by the introduction of the railway. The tahsil is served not only by the line from Mau in Azamgarh to Chand Diara on the Ghagra, connected by a ferry with Ravelganj in Saran, but also by the branch from Phaphna to Ghazipur. On the former there are stations at Phaphna, Ballia, Bansdih Road, Suremanpur and Chand Diara, and on the latter at Chit Pirospur or Baragaon. The chief metalled road is that leading from Ballia to Korantadih and Ghazipur, with its branches to Raora and Baragaon. The others include the station roads of Ballia and those leading to Bansdih and Hannmanganj, the latter being a portion of the road connecting Ballia with Sikan-darpur. The position of the unmetalled roads, which are very numerous, will be seen by a reference to the map. The river is still used to some extent as a highway; the steamers plying between Buxar and Digua-ghat calling daily at Ballia and at Naunanga near Haldi. There are many ferries over the Ganges giving access to the Shahabad district, and a list of them will be found in the appendix. There, too, lists are given showing the schools, post-offices, markets and fairs of the tahsil.\n\nBANSDIH, Pargana KHARIN, Tahsil BANSDIH.\n\nThe headquarters of the tahsil are located in a small town standing in 25\u00b0 58' north latitude and 84\u00b0 14' east longitude,\nat a distance of eleven miles north from Ballia, with which it is connected by a metalled road. The Bansdih Road station on the railway is some five miles distant, being connected by a short metalled branch with that from Bansdih to Ballia. Other roads run south-east to Sahatwar, Reoti and Bairia, north-west to Sikandarpur and Turtipar, and east to Sukhpura and Garwar. The town is merely a large village clustering round several artificial mounds or garhis, on which stand the more pretentious houses of the leading zamindars. Most of the houses are built on raised sites, owing to the low level of the surrounding country. The effect is to make the place conspicuous from a distance, and the neighbourhood is rendered picturesque by the numerous groves and tanks. Its internal aspect is, however, impaired by the many unsightly pits and excavations, the presence of many ruined mud houses, and the absence of any regular street.\n\nLittle is known of its early history, though tradition states that it lay in the heart of the Chera country. There are no remains attributed to this race in Bansdih itself, but the ruins of the fort held by their last Raja are pointed out in the neighbouring and now almost deserted village of Deorhi. The Cherus were displaced by the Naraulia or Naramni Rajputs, whose descendants still own much of the surrounding country. In 1841 they were described by Mr. Raikes as the most influential tribe of Rajputs in the district, but soon afterwards they began to suffer from the effects of their extravagance and litigation, with the result that a considerable portion of their property has been sold, and though they are still the principal residents of the place, they are in comparatively reduced circumstances. The showy mansions of their forefathers are mostly in ruins, and form an eloquent contrast to the mud-built houses occupied by the families of the present generation. The purchasers were the descendants of Doekinandan Singh, the famous Bhunihar tahsildar; though the members of this family generally reside in Benares, the town of Bansdih has always been their country residence and the headquarters of their large estate. They own part of the lands of Bansdih itself, which cover 1,101 acres and are assessed at Rs. 2,300.\n\nThe population of the town in 1853 was 7,620 souls, but this dropped to 6,247 in 1865, rising again to 7,319 in 1872, and to\n9,617 in 1881. Ten years later a further decline was observed, the total being 9,447, but at the last census in 1901 Bansdih contained 10,024 inhabitants, of whom 9,249 were Hindus, 744 Musalmans and 31 of other religions, chiefly Sikhs and Aryas. The place has little trade, and the markets held twice a week in the bazar are of purely local importance. There is one sugar refinery and three factories for the manufacture of saltpetre, while the weavers turn out small quantities of country cloth. As a trade centre the town is overshadowed both by Mainar and Sahaiwar, which are far more favourably situated. It was not till the 10th of April 1882 that Bansdih became the headquarters of a separate tahsil. The courts and offices were at first located in a temporary building, the present two-storied structure having attained completion in 1887. Other public institutions include a first-class police-station, a post-office, at present accommodated in a hired house, a cattle-pound, a well-attended middle vernacular school and a dispensary. The last is under the management of the district board, and was built by public subscription; it bears the name of the Maharani Saranmai dispensary in honour of the Maharani of Qasim Bazar, who contributed the sum of Rs. 3,000 towards the cost of erection.\n\nBansdih is administered under the provisions of the Sanitation Act and also of Act XX of 1856, the latter having been in force since 1873. There were 1,082 houses in the town in 1906, and of these about 550 were assessed to taxation; formerly the number was very much greater, but in that year a change of policy was introduced, whereby the poorer houses were exempted. The average income from the house-tax for the three preceding years was Rs. 1,205, giving an incidence of Re. 1-4-0 per assessed house and Re. 0-2-2 per head of population. The total receipts for the same period, including the opening balance, averaged Rs. 1,950, and the expenditure Rs. 1,770; the main items being Rs. 750 for the upkeep of the town police, Rs. 253 for the conservancy staff and Rs. 605 for local public improvements.\n\nRANSDIH Tahsil.\n\nThis tahsil lies along the northern boundary of the district, the Ghagra river washing its borders for the entire length on the\nnorth and separating it from the districts of Gorakhpur and Saran. The tract is roughly triangular in shape, tapering away to a point in the extreme east. To the south lies the Ballia tahsil, while that of Rasra marches with it on the west. Banadih is made up of the two parganas of Kharid and Sikandarpur East, each of which will be separately described. It had in 1906 a total area of 237,858 acres or 371.6 square miles; but this figure varies from year to year with the alterations in the course of the Ghagra, which sometimes swallows large stretches of the alluvial soil on its banks and transfers them to the opposite side, while on other occasions the action is reversed, strips of new deposit being thrown up on the southern shore. The cultivated area in the same year was 180,995 acres or 251.5 square miles, the average proportion of cultivation to the total area being about 68 per cent.\n\nTopographically the tahsil is divided into two distinct tracts, the one comprising the alluvial land along the Ghagra, and the other the upland or older formation. The latter extends over the greater part of Sikandarpur East and the western and southern portions of Kharid. It is drained by several small watercourses running from west to east and falling into the Ghagra or its backwaters, or else into the great Surnha Tal to the southwest of Banadih. The low alluvium is cut up by numerous channels, of which the Tengraha alone has a perennial flow. In many instances the abandoned river beds have become silted up, and this has resulted in the formation of several large lakes, of which the most remarkable are those of Mundiar and Reoti.\n\nThe tahsil forms a subdivision of the district and is in the charge of a full-powered officer. There is a tahsildar with headquarters at Banadih, and at the present time Babu Bisheshwar Kunwar of Sahatwar is an honorary magistrate with third class powers within the limits of the Banadih police circle, while Babu Padam Deo Narayan Singh of Bairia has similar power in the Reoti circle, and Maulvi Abul Baka in that of Sikandarpur. The civil jurisdiction is divided between the munsifs of Ballia and Rasra, the former having Kharid in his charge and the latter Sikandarpur East. Police-stations are maintained at Banadih, Sikandarpur and Reoti. Their circles comprise almost the\nentire area, though a few villages of Sikandarpur East are included in the jurisdiction of the Ubhaon and Nagra thanas in the Rasra tahsil.\n\nThe first census of this subdivision to be taken after the constitution of the district was that of 1881, when the population numbered 237,292 souls. The total dropped to 261,531 in 1891, but at the last enumeration in 1901 the tahsil contained 293,919 inhabitants, of whom 153,059 were females. A classification by religious showed 274,388 Hindus, 19,462 Musalmans, 42 Sikhs, 23 Aryas and four Christians. Rajputs are the predominant Hindu caste, numbering 87,375; they belong to many different clans, of which the most important are the Sengars, Narains, Barwars, Nikumbhs, Bais, Gautams and Raghubansis. Next to them come Ahirs, 32,083; Brahmans, 29,916; Koeris, 25,083; Bhars, 21,041; Chamars, 18,069; Banias, 12,007; and Bhuinbars, 9,029. As elsewhere, Julahas form the bulk of the Musalman population, numbering 10,110, and no other caste or tribe occurs in any strength, except perhaps the Sheikhs, who are fairly numerous in the neighbourhood of Sikandarpur. The tahsil resembles the rest of the district in being almost wholly agricultural, and according to the census returns 60 per cent. of the people were directly dependent on agriculture, and an additional six per cent. on general labour. There are no manufactures or industries of any note, but mention may be made of cotton-weaving and sugar and saltpetre refining, though neither of the latter assumes the same prominence as in other tahsils. The trade is, however, considerable, and the five towns of Maniar, Sahatwar, Bansdih, Reoti and Sikandarpur are all commercial centres of some note, especially the first two.\n\nThe northern portions of the tahsil suffer from defective means of communication, but it has been recently proposed to construct a branch line of railway giving access to Maniar and Sikandarpur. At present the railway only touches the southern confines of Kharid, passing to the south of Sahatwar and Reoti, with stations at each place. The Bansdih Road station lies in the Ballia tahsil, but is connected with Bansdih by a metalled road. The other roads are unmetalled and often of an inferior description. The chief are those connecting Sikandarpur\nwith the three tahsil headquarters, that running to Bansdih being a portion of the road from Bairia and Sahatwar to Turtipar and Dohri-ghat in the Aramgarh district. The position of the other roads will be seen in the map. The Ghagra is crossed in several places by ferries, a list of which may be seen in the appendix. There, too, are given lists of the schools, post-offices, markets and fairs of the tahsil.\n\nBARAGAON, Pargana KOPACHIT EAST, Tahsil BALLIA.\n\nThe town of Baragaon, otherwise known as Chit Firozpur from the name of the two component villages, is situated in $25^\\circ 45' N.$ and $84^\\circ 1' E.$, some ten miles west from Ballia, three miles south-west from Phephna, and about two miles from the Ghazipur road, with which it is connected by a metalled branch leading to the station on the line of railway from Ghazipur to Phephna. The same road continues westwards in an unmetalled state to Ghazipur, keeping to the south of and parallel to the railway. Chit lies to the north of the line and to the west of the station, close to the right bank of the Sarju, while Firozpur is to the south, on either side of the road. The former is the more densely populated, and consists of an irregular assemblage of mud houses without regular streets, and traversed only by narrow and tortuous lanes. Being of considerable age the site is raised and consequently the drainage towards the Sarju is effective. The population of the place numbered 12,234 in 1853, but has since declined. In 1881 it was 10,847, and this fell to 10,725 in 1891, while at the last census Baragaon contained 9,406 inhabitants, of whom 848 were Musalmans.\n\nBaragaon is the principal residence of the Kausik Rajputs, who hold almost all the pargana of Kopachit south of the Sarju. The lands of Chit and Firozpur cover 834 acres, assessed at Rs. 838, and owned by a Kausik community. Their patron saint is Bhikha Shah, who holds a position analogous to that of Nath Baba, the holy man of the Sengars. His followers have a monastery here, and from the road can be seen the tombs of the departed leaders of the sect with their seven domes. Adjoining the town, on either side of the road, are two large tanks. One is of stone\nmasonry throughout, the finest in the district, and was built some years ago by a banker named Din Dayal Ram, a Barhai by caste, at a cost of more than a lakh of rupees. Bargaon possesses a post-office, an upper primary school, a cattle-pound and a bazaar in which markets are held twice a week. A considerable fair takes place here on the Dasahra festival in Kuar, and is attended by some 4,000 persons.\n\nThe provisions of the Sanitation Act are in force in addition to those of Act XX of 1856, the latter having been extended in 1890 to an area of 97 acres. In 1900 there were 2,180 houses in the town, of which 813 were assessed to taxation, the number of the latter having recently been reduced by exempting many of the poorer class. The average income from the house-tax for the three preceding years was Rs. 1,605, giving an incidence of Re. 1-0-10 per assessed house and Re. 0-2-0 per head of population. The total receipts for the same period, including the opening balance, averaged Rs. 2,092, and the expenditure Rs. 1,512, the chief items being Rs. 1,080 for the upkeep of the town police force, Rs. 180 for the maintenance of a conservancy staff, and Rs. 205 for local public improvements.\n\nBASANTPUR, Pargana and Tahsil\n\nBALLIA.\n\nThis large and flourishing village is situated on the northern borders of the pargana in 25\u00b0 49' N. and 84\u00b0 8' E., some two miles to the east of the road from Ballia to Sikandarpur, and six miles north of the district headquarters. The main site is built on the western bank of the Baraha Tal, and the whole of the produce of this lake belongs to the proprietors. The population at the last census numbered 4,229 souls, including 333 Mussalmans. The principal Hindu inhabitants are Donwar Rajputs who formerly held all the Basantpur tahsila. This was settled in 1790 with Rishan Chand, the agent of the notorious Deokinandan Singh, but the Donwars took action under Regulation I of 1821 and recovered the greater portion of the estate. They still hold most of the village which has an area of 2,580 acres and is assessed at Rs. 3,008. Basantpur contains a lower primary school and a bazaar in which markets are held twice a week.\nBHADAON Pargana.\n\nThis is the westernmost pargana of the tahsil and district, being bounded on the west by Azamgarh, on the south by Ghazipur and on the north and east by pargana Sikandarpur West, which, like Bhadaon, formed part of Azamgarh till the constitution of the Ballia district in 1879. It is the smallest of all the parganas, having a total area of only 32,275 acres or 50-4 square miles.\n\nThe pargana lies wholly in the upland portion of the district and in its general appearance is a level plain, chiefly characterised by a defective drainage system; the land sloping imperceptibly from the north to the south towards the river Sarju, which for a very short distance touches the southern boundary. Along the northern border runs the irregular chain of swamps known as the Basnahi, which passes into pargana Sikandarpur near Ratanpura. A second ill-defined depression originates in the centre of the pargana, passing southwards in a succession of jhils, of which the largest is that at Itaura, to join the Sarju. In wet years considerable damage is done by flooding, and the effect of saturation is apparent from the presence of large tracts of barren land. Clay is the prevalent soil, but in the more raised portions it changes into a light loam of considerable fertility. The pargana is mainly dependent on rice, and to a larger extent than any other is liable to suffer from an early cessation of the monsoon.\n\nThe average cultivated area for the five years ending in 1906 was 18,000 acres or 57-8 per cent. of the whole pargana. This is the lowest proportion in the district, and is solely due to the prevalence of water. Much of the latter is nominally classified as culturable, the area coming under this head being 7,981 acres, of which 541 were under groves and 1,224 were new or temporary fallow, the remainder being divided between old fallow and unproductive waste. The barren area occupies 5,027 acres or 17-5 per cent. of the whole, including 1,806 acres under water and 860 acres occupied by sites, buildings and roads. The grove area is extremely small, being only 1-6 per cent. of the pargana, a proportion which is largely exceeded in every other part of the district, not even excepting Doaha. Means of irrigation are naturally abundant, and on an average no less\nthan 60 per cent. of the cultivated area receives water, this being the highest proportion in the district. This is obtained mainly from wells, which account for 50 per cent., but tanks, jhils and streams are utilized to a far greater extent than in other parganas of the district, although they have the disadvantage of failing in dry years when the need of water is greatest. The kharif is the more important harvest, averaging 13,134 acres as compared with 10,002 acres cultivated in the rabi. The double-cropped area extends to some 24 per cent. of the net cultivation, this proportion being similar to that of pargana Sikandarpur West. Rice accounts for no less than 55 per cent. of the kharif area, the other principal crops being sugarcane, 14 per cent, and arhar eight per cent. In the rabi, peas take the lead with nearly 40 per cent., this crop being generally grown in succession to early rice; and then come barley with 31 per cent., and wheat either sown alone or in combination, with 15-6 percent. The remainder consists chiefly in gram and a small amount of poppy.\n\nHigh caste tenants slightly preponderate, but much of their land is sublet or also worked by hired labour. No less than 40 per cent. of the cultivation is in the hands of the proprietors, either as sir or khandaatt, this figure being only approached in Garha and Lakhnesar, in either of which practically the entire pargana is or formerly was held by a single caste. Tenants at fixed rates hold eight per cent., occupancy tenants 19 per cent., and tenants-at-will 21 per cent., the remainder being either rent-free or held by ex-proprietary tenants. The sublet area is probably larger than in any other pargana of the district, amounting to more than 34 per cent. of the cultivation. The average rate paid by these shihami tenants is Rs. 6-5-0 per acre, this being a fair index of the relative capacity of the tract. Tenants at fixed rates pay no more than Rs. 3-1-2, occupancy tenants Rs. 4-2-4, and tenants-at-will Rs. 4-12-0. The difference between the last figure and that of the shihami holdings is due to the fact that all the best land is either retained by the proprietors or else cultivated by the privileged classes. The present revenue demand of the pargana is Rs. 25,282, to which may be added Rs. 3,555 on account of cesses. There are 129 villages, divided into 428 mahals, of which 47 are owned by single samindars, 47 by bhaiyachara\ncommunities, 220 are joint zamindari, 35 perfect pattidari, and the remainder 69 are owned in the imperfect variety of the same tenure. Rajputs possess 57 per cent. of the land, Bhumihars 13 per cent., Kayasthas seven per cent., Musalmans six per cent., and Brahmins five per cent., the remainder being held by other Hindus. There are no large proprietors and the chief village communities are composed of Chauhan, Barahia, Bisen and Donwar Rajputs.\n\nThe population of Bhadaon in 1881 numbered 28,386 persons, and this rose to 29,592 at the following census. In 1901 a marked decline was observed, in common with the rest of the tahsil, the total dropping to 24,590, of whom 843 were Musalmans. The tract is purely agricultural, and there is not a single village of any size or importance, the largest being Chakra with 1,410 inhabitants. Haldharpur is an insignificant place, and was selected as a site of a police-station merely by reason of its situation on the road from Nagra to Man in Azamgarh, which is here joined by that from Rasra. Though traversed by two lines of railway, there is no station within the limits of the pargana; but Ludara is within a short distance of the western border, and that of Ratanpura lies close to the eastern boundary. Through the latter place runs a road leading northwards to Bilaunjha and Bhimpura.\n\nThe pargana was originally included in the Ghazipur district, and at the time of the permanent settlement formed part of the lease of Bain Rup Singh, whose prudent administration was warmly commended by Mr. Duncan. It remained in Ghazipur till its transfer to Azamgarh in 1832, and continued to form part of that district till the formation of Ballia in 1879.\n\nBHALSAND, Pargana and Tahsil BALLIA.\n\nBhalsand, otherwise spelled Bharsaud, Bhalusaur, Bhehar and Bhalsand, while other variants occasionally appear, is a large village lying in 25\u00b0 43' N. and 84\u00b0 15' E., about a mile to the south of the road from Ballia to Bairia, at a distance of six miles from the former. It belongs to taluka Karnai, and is undoubtedly a place of great antiquity: the name is said to be derived from a holy man of Prayag, named Bharadwaj, who lived here for a time, and the reputed founder was Raja Ram Deo of Haldi, who\nflourished according to tradition in the twelfth century. The village now belongs to the Dumraon estate, but was formerly included in the domains of the Hayobans Rajas. The population in 1881 was 3,950, and this rose to 6,631 at the following census. A slight decline was observed in 1901, the number of inhabitants being 5,373, including 554 Musalmans and large colonies of Donwar Rajputs and Brahmins. The area of the village lands is 1,007 acres, and the revenue Rs. 1,616. The place possesses a flourishing middle school, a post-office, a weekly market, and 15 looms for the manufacture of country cloth.\n\nBILTHRA, Pargana Sikandarpur West, Tahsil Rasra.\n\nBilthra, or Belthra, is a village in the north of the pargana, standing on the right bank of the Ghagra in 26\u00b0 7' N. and 83\u00b0 54' E., at a distance of about 30 miles from Ballia and 18 miles from the headquarters of the tahsil. Close to the village runs the road from Sikandarpur to Turtipar, from which a branch takes off at Ubhaou and leads south to Nagra and Rasra. From Ubhaou a raised unmetalled road has recently been constructed giving access to the Bilthra Road station, which lies some four miles to the west. The station lies in the village of Siar, which also contains a post-office and an inspection bungalow, the latter having been purchased from the railway authorities by the district board in 1904. Bilthra proper contained at the last census a population of 2,202 persons, but to this should be added that of the hamlets of Sahiya and Karimganj, though the former actually lies within the limits of Haliti; the principal castes are Brahmins and Kaolu Banias. Till 1902 Bilthra was united with Turtipar for the purposes of Act XX of 1856. The place contains a lower primary school and a branch post-office; markets are held twice a week in the bazar, which lies partly in the village of Sahiya, and a considerable trade is carried on in wheat, rice and other grains imported from the Gorakhpur and Basti districts, though the importance of the river-borne traffic has dwindled to some extent with the opening of the railway. There is also a considerable import of sal timber, which is brought from the forests of Gorakhpur and despatched to the districts of Ballia, Ghazipur and Azamgarh. Bilthra has an\narea of 235 acres, paying a revenue of Rs. 223, while that of Sahiya is 299 acres, assessed at Rs. 216. The proprietors are Brahmans, whose ancestors were for a time dispossessed by the Bais of Nagra, though they regained their rights at the permanent settlement; the Bais still retain the right to collect certain bazar dues, but have no interest in the soil.\n\nCHAKIA, Pargana DOABA, Tahsil BALLIA.\n\nA village standing in $25^\\circ 47'$ N. and $84^\\circ 28'$ E., on the banks of the Bhagar nala, one of the branches of the Burhganga or old channel of the Ganges, a short distance east of the road from Bairia to Roori and Banadih, two miles north from Bairia and about 22 miles from the headquarters of the district. Its name denotes its alluvial origin, the land having doubtless been thrown up in the form of a chakki or island at some distant period. In addition to the main site, there are several hamlets, the largest being Jamalpur to the north. Chakia forms part of the Damodarpur taluka and since the permanent settlement has been included in the Durnoon estate. The old Rajput owners were of the Anthaian clan, and their descendants are still the principal residents. Jamalpur was founded by Muhammadans, while other castes include Koeris, Ahirs, Telis, Kalwars and Mallahs. The population in 1881 numbered 3,327, and this dropped to 3,277 in 1891; at the last census there were 3,150 residents, of whom 74 were Musalmans. There is an indigenous unaided school in Jamalpur, but otherwise the place is wholly unimportant and only deserves mention for the number of its inhabitants.\n\nCHAND DIARA, Pargana DOABA, Tahsil BALLIA.\n\nThis village comprises all the north-eastern portion of the pargana, and included in 1906 about 7,825 acres of the alluvial land along the Ghagra. It is a stretch of country cut up in every direction by old channels of this river and the Tengraha, its aspect and area varying with every annual flood. The main inhabited site lies in $25^\\circ 47'$ N. and $84^\\circ 34'$ E., on the road from Bairia to Revelganj, at a distance of six miles east from the former, and some 26 miles from the district headquarters.\nThe railway station of Chand Diara stands about two miles to the north, near the present bank of the river, which is crossed by a steam ferry. A permanent bridge is now being erected at this spot, and this costly enterprise will be completed within a few years. There is also a boat ferry for persons going by road, leading direct to Rovalganj, under the management of the Saran authorities. The village of Chand Diara belongs to the Dumraon estate, and is assessed to a revenue of Rs. 4,641; the tenants are chiefly Rajputs and Kayasthas. The population at the last census numbered 1,491 souls, of whom all but four were Hindus.\n\nCHANDPUR, Pargana Kharid, Tehsil Bansdih.\n\nThis large and important village belongs to tappa Sahatwar and is divided in equal shares between the taluqas of Madho Rai and Lakhmi Rai, both of which were permanently settled with Kinwar Rajputs. The owners of Madho Rai still hold their estate intact, but about one-third of taluka Lakhmi Rai was sold for arrears of revenue and purchased by the Pandes of Bairia, who have thus acquired a fractional share in Chandpur. The village lies in 25\u00b0 54' N. and 84\u00b0 20' E., at a distance of seven miles east-north-east from Bansdih, 17 miles from Ballia, and five miles north from Sahatwar, with which it is connected by a road leading to the Rampur Diara ferry over the Ghagra. The population, which in 1881 numbered 2,859, had risen at the last census to 3,246 persons, including 80 Musalmans and a large community of Rajputs. The place contains a lower primary school, and markets are held twice weekly in the bazar; the only manufacture is that of cotton cloth, four looms being at work at the present time. A small fair takes place here on the occasion of the Dasahra festival.\n\nCHHATA, Pargana and Tehsil Ballia.\n\nThe village of Chhata stands on the northern border of the pargana, in 25\u00b0 49' N. and 84\u00b0 15' E., on the north side of the road from Ballia to Sahatwar, at a distance of eight miles north-east from the district headquarters and four miles south from Bansdih. To the south of the road runs the railway, the nearest\nstation being that of Bansdib Road or Gharamuli, some two miles to the south-west. The village contained at the last census a population of 3,207 souls, of whom 194 were Musalmans. It is a thriving place, with a sugar factory, five looms and a bazar in which markets are held twice a week; there is also a branch post-office, a large and flourishing upper primary school, and two indigenous unaided schools. Chhata gives its name to a taluka and is said to have been founded many centuries ago by a Kinwar Rajput named Chhatarpal Singh, from whom the place probably derived its name. The Kinwars still retain most of their ancestral possessions, including this village, which has an area of 249 acres and pays a revenue of Rs. 274.\n\nCHILKAHAR, Pargana KORACHIT WEST, Tahsil RASNA.\n\nA village lying on the north side on the metalled road from Phosphna to Rasna, in 25\u00b0 40' N. and 83\u00b0 59' E., at a distance of seven miles from the tahsil headquarters and fourteen miles from Ballia. To the north of the village runs the railway, on which there is a station, from which the place derives its chief importance. It is the principal village of the Chilkahar taluka, which was permanently settled with Kacholiya Rajputs, and is still in the possession of the descendants of the original proprietors. The property of the chief shawrs is now under the management of the Court of Wards. The total area of the village is 1,107 acres and the revenue Rs. 901. The population in 1881 numbered 2,138, and has since declined; in 1891 it was 1,905, while at the last census it had fallen to 1,833, of whom 202 were Musalmans. The village contains a lower primary school, two sugar refineries, seven looms and a bazar in which markets are held twice a week.\n\nCHIT FIROZPUR, vide BARAGAON.\n\nDOABA Pargana, Tahsil BALLIA.\n\nThis pargana comprises the easternmost portion of the tahsil and district, and as its name implies forms the tract lying between the Ganges and Ghagra rivers, from the borders of Khairil and Ballia almost to the confluence. The latter is situated in the\nShahabad district of Bengal, which also bounds Doaba on the south. Beyond the Ghagra to the north is Saran, also in Bengal. The whole tract lies in the alluvial basin of the two rivers and is subject to fluvial action; so much so, indeed, that the area varies from time to time with the changes in the main channels, and the fluctuations are greater than in any other part of the district, not even excepting pargana Ballia itself. The total area in 1906 was 56,950 acres or 139 square miles, while the average for five years is 87,194 acres, ranging from 85,709 acres in 1905 to 89,939 acres in 1902. The latter figure contrasts remarkably with that of 1881, when the pargana had an area of only 122 square miles.\n\nAlmost the whole pargana is inundated annually during the rains, and nothing appears above the water but a few slightly elevated spots on which the permanent village sites are built. For this reason the villages are of an unusually large size, both as regards area and in the number of their inhabitants; the cultivators often have to go long distances to their fields, and in many cases they take up their abode in temporary huts, which are dismantled on the approach of the rains, such locations going by the generic name of chhapra. In the interior of the pargana the floods are of short duration, and the soil is not subject to demudation, but is rich and well wooded. Along the rivers, on the other hand, the soil varies from place to place and from year to year, as the deposits of the river are seldom constant, so that a field of fertile silt may the next year be converted into a waste and barren sand. This liability to change has given rise to the custom known as halpunchit, which has been already described in chapter I. Under such circumstances constant changes in the boundaries of the pargana are unavoidable, at any rate along the Ghagra and Ganges. Elsewhere they have been fixed as far as possible, for that on the west closely follows the course of the old channel known as the Burhganga, while that on the east was clearly defined in 1878 as the boundary on stable land between the villages of Karan Chhapra and Ibrahimabad on the one hand, and Shitab Diara on the other; while this line was completed by producing it due north from the Ibrahimabad extremity to the deep stream of the Ghagra, and due south from\nthe Karan Chhapra end to the deep stream of the Ganges. Shitab Diara, though treated as a single village, is in reality an immense taluq, some eight miles or more in length and comprising a number of populous sites. It belongs to the Shahabad district of Bengal, though it is not easy to understand the reason for its retention in that province. As a matter of fact, the attachment of the Doaba pargana itself to this district was originally merely due to the circumstance that a change in the course of the Ganges left the tract on the northern bank; whereas formerly it had been merely a tappa in the Bibia pargana of Shahabad. It is known that at the time of the permanent settlement the confluence of the Ganges with the Ghagra was at or near Bhakar, about 20 miles west of the present junction. Then the Ganges flowed in the channel now known as the Burhganga, and the change appears to have taken place at the commencement of the last century. At the same time the extensive village of Chand Diara belonged to Saran in Bengal, and the resultant difficulty of administration was recognised at an early date.\n\nThe fact that Doaba was formerly included in Bibia has given rise to a peculiar custom in the matter of alluvion and diluvion. Here the ordinary deep-stream rule is modified in the sense that proprietary right is determined by the village site and not by reference to the channel adopted by the river. If a mauza on the south bank is diluviated and the site emerges after a time on the north bank, the mauza is demarcated on the latter side and the land on that site is not an accretion to the other villages adjacent to it. Consequently, as the river has swayed backwards and forwards several times since the survey of 1840, there can now be no unappropriated river bed; for it all belongs to some mauza or another, and it usually follows that as every mauza is bounded by other mauzas there can be no alluvial increment. The only proprietary disputes about boundaries relate to the correctness with which these boundaries are laid down on the spot according to previous maps, and also to those mauzas diluviated at the time of the survey, for which no maps were on that account in existence. At a time when the Ganges ran through the tract and was not the boundary between this\npargana and another, its changes of position did not affect the fact that both banks were in Bihia, and as it was not the boundary of the pargana, so also it was not the boundary of the villages on its banks which might emerge either on one side or the other, and sometimes partly on one and partly on the other side. The proprietor both in Doula and Bihia, and also in the adjoining pargana of Arrah, is the Maharani of Dumraon, and consequently the disputes are limited to those between the estate and its tenants, the former generally claiming new alluvium as a reformation free from subordinate occupancy right, and the old tenants claiming it as their ancient holdings. These different points of view have resulted in innumerable law-suits, in which the tenants have been generally successful.\n\nThe average cultivated area for the last five years has been 51,937 acres or 65-3 per cent. of the whole. Of the remainder, 25-9 per cent. is shown as barren, consisting chiefly of sandy waste, and 8-8 per cent., inclusive of two per cent. grove land, as culturable waste. The actually barren area is not more than 12-6 per cent., the rest being under water or occupied by villages and roads; but even this is much above the district average, as is also the case in Kharid and Ballia. There is very little irrigation in this pargana, for none is required, except for garden crops, which are watered from small temporary wells; the average area irrigated is 880 acres or less than two per cent. of the cultivation. The rabi is by far the more important harvest, as much of the land cannot be sown in the kharif, the latter averaging 32,400 acres as compared with 46,048 acres in the former. The chief rabi crops are peas, gram and barley, the two last being usually found in combination, while wheat is extensively grown, covering 17 per cent. of the area. In the kharif two-thirds of the harvest consists of milo, and the bulk of the remainder of kodo; there is very little rice and practically no sugarcane. A notable feature of the cultivation in this pargana is the extent to which the practice of double-cropping is carried; the area bearing two crops in the year averaging 40 per cent. of the net cultivation, a figure which is far in excess of that recorded in any other part.\n\nAlmost the whole pargana belongs to the Dumraon estate, the remainder amounting to less than ten per cent. of the area.\nThis is held partly by an Agarwal family of Arrah, partly by the Pandes of Bairia, whose ancestors were the agents of the Dumraon Rajas, and partly by the Raja of Haldi, whose father obtained two small villages in return for mutiny services. There are altogether 106 mauzas, divided into 154 mahals, of which five are settled temporarily. Apart from the latter, 95 are held in single and 47 in joint zamindari tenure, the remaining seven being pattidar. There is one small revenue-free village of 61 acres, known as Bhawatia, from the Bhats, who originally settled there and whose descendants are still the owners. The cultivators are principally Lohatamia Rajputs, who formerly held the entire pargana and still retain a large number of villages as lessees; they are a lawless and independent race, and in old days were the patrons of the numerous gangs of Dusadhs, whose depredations rendered the tract notorious. Other castes include Ahirs, Koeris, Kahars, Bhuinbars, Telis, Chamars and Mallahs. Proprietary cultivation is necessarily very limited, and only 3-3 per cent. is held as sir or khedkasht. Tenants at fixed rates are in possession of 33 per cent., occupancy tenants of 28 per cent. and tenants-at-will of 32 per cent., the remainder being rent-free. About 11 per cent. is sublet, and for this area the rental is no less than Rs. 13-11-7 per acre, a figure which clearly indicates the remarkable fertility of the pargana. Tenants at fixed rates pay Rs. 4-10-1, and those with rights of occupancy Rs. 4-12-8 per acre, while tenants-at-will pay only Rs. 4-6-11, this low rate being due to the fact that they only hold the more inferior lands. There is a peculiar custom in Doaba in respect of the imposition of a special cess known as batta at the rate of 1\u00bd annas in the rupee, together with three pies as gaon &harcha or village expenses. This cess dates back to the permanent settlement, and was due to the difference between the value of the gaunharshahi rupees then current in Bihar and the coins of the East India Company. The right of enforcing this cess was recognised in 1840, and it was subsequently ruled by the High Court that the cess could be legally claimed when the zamindar could prove its collection for 12 years. At the last revision it was not disputed and was amalgamated with the rent. The present demand for the pargana is Rs. 76,644, the regular cess contributing an additional Rs. 10,422. The\nformer is exclusive of the rent, amounting in 1906 to Rs. 3,000, paid to Government for Island No. 36, a tract of alluvial land between Chand Diara and Shitah Diara. The existence of this area was first discovered in 1864, and for eleven years it belonged to the Saran district. Possession was claimed by the Maharaja of Dungriou, but the revenue courts held that it belonged to Government. It has no distinctive name, but retains the number given to it when the islands and sandbanks along the Ghagra were labelled for the purpose of identification.\n\nThe population of Doaba in 1881 numbered 88,024 persons, and this rose to 89,545 at the following census. A further increase was observed in 1901, when the pargana contained 96,686 inhabitants, of whom 93,831 were Hindus, 2,825 Musalmans, and 30 of other religions. The only town is Bairia, but there is a number of large villages, several of which are of quite unusual size, though otherwise of no interest or importance whatever, excepting Kotwa, which includes the thriving bazar of Raniganj. The villages of Sonbarsa, Srinagar, Ibrahimabad, Jagdowa, Chakia and Murli Chhapra all contain over 3,000 inhabitants, and the average population of every village is over 900. Means of communication are very fair during the dry weather, but poor in the rains. Through the north runs the railway from Ballia to Revelganj, with stations at Suremanpur and Chand Diara. These two places are connected by inferior roads with that leading from Ballia to Bairia and Revelganj, while others go from Bairia to Reoti and Bansdih on the north-west and to two ferries over the Ganges on the south, one of which gives access to the Bihia station on the East Indian Railway.\n\nDUHA BEHRA, Pargana Silandarpur East, Tahsil Bansdih.\n\nThis large village stands on the right bank of the Ghagra, in 26\u00b0 7' N. and 88\u00b0 59' E., about two miles north of the road from Silandarpur to Turtipar, 32 miles from Ballia and 22 miles from the tahsil headquarters. It is one of the principal places in the tappa of Havali Kharid, which was transferred from the Ghazipur to the Azamgarh district in 1838, and again detached from the latter with the rest of the pargana in 1879. The place is said to have been first colonised by Sengar Rajputs.\nof the Birahia subdivision, soon after their advent to these parts. The Sangars still hold the greater part of the land, though portions have been sold to Brahmins, Mallahs, Musalmans and Atits. The revenue is, however, assigned to the Maharaja of Qasim Bazar, as the village was included in the jagir of his ancestor, Kishan Kanth Nandi, commonly called Kantu Babu, the confidential servant and private secretary of Warren Hastings, who made the grant in 1785.\n\nThe village, which covers an area of 3,533 acres, contains a main site and several detached hamlets. The total population in 1881 was 4,054, and this fell to 3,564 in 1891. The last census saw a further decline, the number of inhabitants being 3,309, of whom 217 were Musalmans. Duha Behra has some commercial importance, being a port of call for the steamers of the India General Steam Navigation Company, and possessing five sugar refineries, thirty looms for the manufacture of country cloth, and a market held twice a week.\n\nDUMRI, Pargana Kopachit West, Tahsil Rasba.\n\nThe village of Dumri lies in the south of the pargana in 25\u00b0 47' N. and 83\u00b0 58' E., at a distance of some 12 miles west from Ballia, seven miles from the tahsil headquarters, and about a mile north of the Sarju. To the east of the village runs the road from Garwar to Tajpur station and Ghazipur, and at the point where the road crosses the river are the extensive remains of an old fort, standing in the village of Mathi. Dumri itself is chiefly of importance as giving its name to a taluka of pargana Kopachit, which was permanently settled with Karcholia Rajputs and is still held by their descendants. The population at the last census numbered 2,199 persons, including 394 Musalmans and a large community of Karcholias; the area is 1,223 acres and the revenue Rs. 1,307. The village contains a lower primary school and a bazaar in which markets are held twice a week; it is the centre of a flourishing sugar trade, eleven factories being at work at the present time, though in former days the number was much greater. There is also a considerable business in country cloth, which is turned out by the Musalman Julahas, who possess nine looms.\nGAIGHAT, Pargana KHANID, Tahsil BANDIH.\n\nA village on the road from Ballia and Sahatwar to Recti, at a distance of a mile and a half south-west from the latter place, nine miles east from Bandih, and 18 miles from Ballia. It lies in 25\u00b0 50' N. and 84\u00b0 22' E., between the road on the south and the Recti Dab on the north. The Dab is a large perennial lake, which was once the bed of the Ghagra, and the name of Gaighat is probably derived from the fact that in former days the village stood on the banks of the river, which was crossed here by a ferry. The place gives its name to one of the taluqas of tappa Recti; it was permanently settled with Nikumbh Rajputs, and is still held by their descendants, though a portion has passed by sale into the hands of Bhunihars. The area is 196 acres, and the revenue Rs. 625. The population has remained practically stationary for some years, and at the last census numbered 2,566 souls, including 151 Musalmans. The latter are chiefly Julahas, and four looms are still working in the village. At one time there was a thriving trade in sugar, but the refineries have lately been closed. Gaighat possesses a lower primary school, and markets are held twice a week in the bazar.\n\nGARHA Pargana, Tahsil BALLIA.\n\nThis pargana represents the latest addition to the district, having been included in Ghazipur till as late as 1892, when it was added to the Ballia tahsil. It is of small extent, and consists of a triangular block of country with its apex to the south. On the west lies the Muhammadabad tahsil of Ghazipur; on the north the boundary marches with those of the two parganas of Kopachit and pargana Ballia, while on the east the Ganges separates it from Shahabad in Bengal. Owing to the motion of the river, the area varies from time to time, but to a far less extent than elsewhere in its course, as the channel is determined for some distance by a series of karar reefs, which reduces erosion to a minimum. The total area in 1906 was 37,642 acres or 58.8 square miles, this including Narainpur and the two other villages of pargana Muhammadabad, which were added shortly after the transfer of Garha to this district. The average area for the five preceding years was 37,737 acres.\nOnly a small portion of the pargana belongs to the upland tract, which includes a narrow strip of land between the borders of Kopachit and the Mangai river. The latter flows from west to east across the northern half of the pargana, and beyond the large village of Nashi it bends northwards to join the Sarju near Anjorpur in pargana Ballia. These uplands possess a loam soil of a somewhat sandy texture, similar to that found in Kopachit. The Mangai generally marks the limit of the high country, and to the south of this stream the land is of an alluvial character, the soil being the rich dark deposits of the Ganges, known locally as kara\u00efl. It is extremely fertile, and as a rule requires little irrigation; wells indeed are difficult to construct, owing to the underlying stratum of sand. There are moreover few jhils or streams in this tract, although they are common in the uplands, especially in the neighbourhood of Karon. Most of the alluvial land is of ancient origin, and the cultivation is as stable as any in the district; but immediately along the Ganges there is a considerable area liable to inundation, particularly in the north-east, where the main channel of the river shifts from side to side in a bed five miles or more in breadth. In the south this fluvial area is extremely narrow, but it widens in the north, its westerly limit being as a rule about a mile east of the Ghazipur road. In those portions of the pargana excellent rabi crops are produced, while the kharif is very scanty by reason of the annual floods.\n\nTaken as a whole, the pargana has attained a higher state of development than any other in the district. For the last five years the cultivated area has averaged 31,206 acres or no less than 82.7 per cent. of the whole. The land classified as barren amounts to 4,443 acres or 11.3 per cent., leaving only 2,282 acres or six per cent. as culturable waste, while of the latter 1,116 acres, or very nearly half, are under groves, and 472 acres are new fallow. Similarly of the barren area 1,941 acres are under water, and 1,743 are occupied by villages, roads and buildings; so that it would appear that there is no possibility of any further extension of tillage, as the area available for pasture and the like has been reduced to the lowest proportions. The irrigated area is very small, averaging only 4.4 per cent. of the cultivation, and almost all of this is derived from wells. The rabi is by far\nthe more important harvest in this pargana, as is also the case in the other parts along the Ganges. It averages 25,753 acres as compared with only 16,105 acres sown in the kharif; the double-cropped area amounting to some 35 per cent. of the cultivation, this proportion being only exceeded in Doaba. The chief rabi products are gram, wheat and peas; the area under wheat is comparatively large, while barley is grown to a far less extent than in any other part of the district. In the kharif maize takes the lead, but only averages 18-6 per cent. of the harvest, the other staples being kodon, sanwan, rice and the larger millets, jowar and bajra, the cultivation of which is more common in this pargana than elsewhere in this district.\n\nHigh caste tenants very largely predominate in this part of the district, and hold fully two-thirds of the cultivated land. They are chiefly Bhumihars, who outnumber both Rajputs and Brahmans, and occur in far greater strength than any other caste. Their chief family is that of Narhi, which is a large settlement of the Bemwar clan. At the present time more than 48 per cent. of the land is cultivated by proprietors, either as sir or khudkhaat, the condition of affairs being in many ways similar to that prevailing in Bhulaon and Lakhnesar. Of the rest, 6-6 per cent. is held by tenants at fixed rates, 33-4 per cent. by occupancy tenants, 11-8 per cent. by tenants-at-will, the small remainder being either rent-free or cultivated by ex-proprietors. The Bhumihars are more energetic cultivators than the Rajputs, and only 17 per cent. of the land included in holdings is sublet. The present rent rate averages Rs. 7-13-1 per acre for shikari tenants and Rs. 5-1-5 for ordinary tenants-at-will. Those holding at fixed rates and occupancy tenants, who at the present time usually cultivate the best lands, pay Rs. 4-4-1 and Rs. 3-15-2 per acre respectively. The fixed rate rental is remarkably high, and in this pargana alone does it exceed the average for occupancy tenants. Among the proprietors the Bhumihars come first with 54 per cent. of the land, in spite of their losses at the hands of the Dumraon estate, as the result of litigation which continued for nearly half a century. An account of the present arrangement will be found in the article on Narhi. Rajputs hold nearly 28 per cent., almost all of which belongs to the Maharani of Dumraon; Brahmans ten-\nper cent. and Musalmans two per cent., the remainder being held by other Hindus. There are 176 villages in the pargana, at present divided into 786 mahals, including four which are under a temporary assessment. The prevailing form of tenure is perfect pattidari, which is found in 608 mahals; single zamindari occurs in 75, joint zamindari in 70, imperfect pattidari in 63, and bhaiyachara in 61 mahals. The present revenue demand is Rs. 40,634, while cesses contribute a further Rs. 5,679.\n\nAt the census of 1881 the population numbered 37,708 souls, which represented a substantial increase during the preceding nine years. In 1891 the total had risen still more rapidly to 46,800, while in 1901 the pargana contained 47,168 inhabitants, of whom 2,171 were Musalmans. There are no towns, unless Narhi may be so described, though it is merely an overgrown agricultural community, as also are the large villages of Karon, Narainpur, Bharauli and Sahaon. Excepting Karon, all these places lie on or near to the metalled road from Ballia and Phaphna to Ghasipur, passing through Koramadih, which was for a few years the headquarters of the district. Karon is situated on a branch road leading from Narhi to join the unmetalled road from Baragaon to Ghasipur. Though the railway does not touch this pargana, the Baragaon station lies within easy reach of the northern border, while Buxar, on the opposite side of the Ganges, is little more than a mile from the southern extremity.\n\nThe pargana has no history of its own, beyond that of the Bhunhars; and of these people little is known beyond the vague tradition of early days. The permanent settlement was based on that of an amil, whose work was subsequently revised by Mr. Duncan himself in 1790. The original demand was Rs. 38,672, and this was raised in 1840 to Rs. 39,940, the increase being due to the resumption of revenue-free land. Subsequent additions to the total have been made on account of the assessment of alluvial areas.\n\n**GARWAR, Pargana KOPAONIT EAST, Taluk BALLIA.**\n\nAn important village situated in 25\u00b0 49' N. and 84\u00b0 2' E., at a distance of ten miles north-west from the district headquarters. It stands at the junction of four unmetalled roads, two of\nwhich lead to Phophna and Piaria on the metalled road from Ballia to Rasra, while a third goes north to Khajuri and Sikandarpur, and the fourth runs north-east to Sukhpura and Bansdih. Garwar gives its name to a taluqa which was formerly held by Karcholia Rajputs. The permanent settlement was made with a Bhojhar farmer, Janki Prasad Singh, but the estate was subsequently sold for arrears and was purchased by the famous Deokinandan Singh. It is still in the possession of his descendants, whose property is under the management of the Court of Wards. The area is 735 acres and the revenue Rs. 981. The population of the village at the last census numbered 2,327 souls, including 241 Musalmans and a large body of Karcholias; the total has risen steadily of late years, as in 1881 it was 1,985 and at the succeeding enumeration 2,136. The place contains a police-station, a post-office, a cattle-pound, and a middle vernacular school; there is also a rest-house maintained by the Court of Wards. Markets are held twice a week in the bazar, and three sugar refineries are at work in the village. Garwar is alleged to have been founded by Cherus, and a small mound near the village is said to represent the remains of their stronghold, as is the case with all similar heaps of debris in the district. Another account, however, states that it was formed from the skulls of the recalcitrant Narnanis of Sukhpura, who were slain in a battle with the Oudh official, Mir Rustam Ali. No attempt seems to have been made to test the truth of the legend by excavation.\n\nHAJAUJI, Pargana Kopachit West, Tahsil Rasra.\n\nA thriving village in the centre of the pargana, standing on the left bank of the Budhi nala, in 25\u00b0 51' N. and 83\u00b0 57' E., some two miles north of the road from Ballia to Rasra, at a distance of 15 miles from the former and five miles from the tahsil headquarters. It gives its name to a taluqa which was permanently settled with Karcholia Rajputs, whose descendants retain the greater portion at the present day. The village itself, which has an area of 1,801 acres and is assessed at Rs. 1,054, is now divided into two halves, one held by the Karcholias, and the other by Sheikhs, this share having been acquired by Haji Muhammad Husain, a trader of Rasra. The population of\nHajauli in 1891 numbered 2,850 souls, and this rose at the following census to 2,905. In 1901 the place contained 2,974 inhabitants including 270 Musalmans and a large community of Kacholins. The total excludes several detached hamlets, which are now separately demarcated. In the village are six sugar refineries, 21 looms for the manufacture of country cloth, an upper primary school, and a bazar in which markets are held twice a week.\n\nHALDHARPUR, Pargana Bhadaon, Tahsil Rasra.\n\nHaldharpur is situated in the centre of the pargana, in 25\u00b0 57' N. and 83\u00b0 42' E., at the junction of two roads leading from Nagra on the east and Rasra on the south-east, the former continuing westwards to Mau in Azamgarh. It stands at a distance of 33 miles from Ballia and twelve miles from the tahsil headquarters. Though the railway passes close to the village on the south-west, the nearest station is at Ratanpura, four miles distant. The place is chiefly of importance as possessing a police-station, in addition to which it contains a post-office and a cattle-pound. The thana and pound actually lie in the uninhabited village of Maira Safipur. There is one sugar factory in the village, and two looms. The population at the last census numbered 815 persons, of whom 40 were Musalmans. The principal inhabitants are Sengar Rajputs of the Birahia subdivision, who are the owners of the village; the area is 615 acres, and the revenue Rs. 405.\n\nHALDI, Pargana and Tahsil Ballia.\n\nThis large village gives its name to a taluka which formerly constituted a portion of the great estate held by the Hayobans Rajas. It was settled in 1790 with Raja Bhupal Deo, but the whole subsequently passed into the hands of the Maharaja of Dumnon, so that at the present time the Haldi Raja, who still resides here, owns but an insignificant property, as already narrated in Chapter III. The village lies in 25\u00b0 43' N. and 84\u00b0 10' E., at a distance of some nine miles east of Ballia, with which it is connected by the unmetalled road leading from the district headquarters to Bairia; while\na second road runs northwards to Sahaiwar. The land is entirely alluvial, and the old town, as well as the celebrated fort of the Hayobans, was washed away by the Ganges many years ago. The new village of Haldi, which at the present time is nearly two miles from the river, is in no way remarkable. It possesses a police-station, which stands at some distance to the north of the main site, on the Bairia road, as well as a post-office, a cattle-pound, and an upper primary school, in the same locality. In Haldi itself there is a sugar factory and some 30 looms, while markets are held twice a week in the bazar. The population, which numbered 4,787 in 1881 and 5,308 in 1891, amounted at the last census to 5,269 persons, including 639 Musalmans and a large community of Ahirs. The area of the village is liable to constant change, but in 1905 was 1,828 acres, and the revenue demand is Rs. 1,842.\n\nHALDI, Pargana Sikandarpur West, Tahsil Rasra.\n\nAnother village of this name occupies the north-east corner of pargana Sikandarpur West, lying on the banks of the Ghagra, in 23\u00b0 6' N. and 83\u00b0 56' E., a short distance north of the road from Sikandarpur to Turtipar, some 28 miles from Ballia and 22 miles from Rasra, the headquarters of the tahsil. It is the principal village of the tappa of the same name, which was originally in the possession of Chauharia Rajputs. The latter were overthrown by Kishan Singh and Bishan Singh, the Bais zamindars of Nagra; but early in the 19th century, the leading members of the Chauharias obtained a decree for possession of one-half of the estate, the other remaining with the Nagra family, who sold it to Khafim Ali of Pharsatpur. The village is now divided into two mahals, one being owned by the Chauharias, and the other by Sheikh Abdul Ahad and Wilayat Husain. Haldi is a large straggling village, extending from the borders of the pargana on the east to Bilthra on the west; it has a total area of 1,180 acres, the revenue being Rs. 2,501. In addition to the main site, there are numerous hamlets dotted over the village lands. The total population in 1881 was 3,206, but since that time has declined, dropping to 3,087 in 1891 and 2,021 at the last census. There were only 20 Musalmans, while the Hindus\nconsist of Chaubarias and many different castes. The village possesses a lower primary school, but nothing else of importance. To the south-west there is a series of large jhils, the chief of which is the Barka Tal; this is semi-circular in shape, and doubtless represents an old channel of the Ghagra.\n\nHANUMANGANJ, Pargana and Tahsil BALLIA.\n\nThe name of an important bazar lying in $25^\\circ 48' N.$ and $84^\\circ 9' E.$, on the east side of the road from Ballia to Sikandarpur, which is metalled as far as this point, at a distance of about three miles north from the district headquarters. Hanumanganj is included in the revenue mauza of Zirabasti, but the two form entirely distinct sites, the latter being a mile distant to the south-east, while Hanumanganj practically constitutes a single site with Barahain. The bazar was founded more than a century ago by Ram Manorath, a Kandu Bania, who made it the centre of a large and lucrative trade in sugar. His son, Dhyan Bhagat, constructed the road to Ballia and built the large bridge over the Katesar stream to the south of the village, as well as the tank and temple at Hanumanganj. He was succeeded by Debi Prasad Bhagat, who was the richest banker in the pargana, and about 1865 purchased the entire village of Zirabasti from Munshi Jalal Bakhsh, who had married Hasina Begum, the owner of the Sonwani jagir. It had originally been held by the Hayobans, who are said to have acquired the land from the Cherus, one of whom, named Zira, was the reputed founder. A large brick-strown mound near Zirabasti is the supposed site of a Chera fort. Debi Prasad Bhagat was followed at his death by the present proprietors, who include his son, Babu Jamna Prasad, and Babus Bishan Prasad and Kishan Prasad, the sons of Dhyan Bhagat. The total area of the village is 1,033 acres, and the revenue Rs. 1,578. The population of Zirabasti and Hanumanganj at the last census was 2,644, including 69 Musalmans and a large community of Kamias who are employed chiefly in refining sugar, while many Bhuihars reside in Zirabasti. The sugar trade is still flourishing, though it has somewhat declined of late. Twenty years ago there were 50 refineries, but the number has now dropped to eleven. The proximity of the Suraha Tal is convenient, as is\nsupplies an unlimited amount of the sugar weed used for refining the sugar. There are also four looms in the village, but the weaving industry is in a depressed state. An upper primary school is maintained in the village, half-way between Hanumanganj and Zirahasti, and markets are held in both hamlets, weekly in the parent village and twice a week in Hanumanganj.\n\n**HUSAINABAD, Pargana Kharid, Tehsil Bassudin.**\n\nThe village of Husainabad lies four miles due east from Bansdih and some twelve miles north-east from Ballia, in 25\u00b0 53' N. and 84\u00b0 18' E., at a short distance to the west of the road from Sahatwar to Chandpur. It belongs to tappa Bansdih and, with the exception of small shares recently purchased by Kayasthas and Musalmans, is in the possession of Naraini Rajputs, whose ancestors were admitted to engage at the permanent settlement. The former owners were Brahmins, who were ejected by the Rajputs. Their descendants still hold much of the land at low fixed rates. The name of Husainabad is said to be derived from Humain Shah, the king of Jaunpur, and the story goes that the original village was called Kalasdih, the inhabitants of which incurred the displeasure of the monarch, who in consequence slew all the adult males, destroyed the village, and built on the ruined site a mosque and tank, now in a dilapidated condition. The population of the place in 1901 was 2,724, of whom 67 were Musalmans. The area is 1,349 acres, and the revenue Rs. 1,450. The place possesses a large upper primary school and a bazar, in which markets are held twice a week.\n\n**JAUHI, Pargana and Tehsil Ballia.**\n\nThis large village lies in 25\u00b0 41' N. and 84\u00b0 16' E., at a distance of some eight miles south-east from Ballia, with which it is connected by a poor unmetalled road leading through Sheopurdinr. It is said that about 150 years ago Jauhi lay on the north or Shahabad side of the river, but that the lands after alluviation reformed in this district. At the present time the Ganges flows some distance to the south, but the soil is purely alluvial and the place may at any time lie once more swept away. The village is a mere collection of mud houses, and at the last\ncensus contained 2,750 inhabitants, of whom 119 were Musalmans. Among the Hindus the Chaube Brahmins constitute the prevailing caste. The total area in 1905 was 5,116 acres, and the revenue as determined at the recent revision of records is Rs. 3,083. The place is included in the Haldi taluka, practically the whole of which now belongs to the Dumraon estate. There is a public ferry here over the Ganges, owned by the district board and leased in conjunction with that at Hansnagar to the east.\n\nKARAMMAR, Pargana KULARO, Tahsil BANEDH.\n\nA very large village in the extreme west of the pargana, lying in 25\u00b0 53' N. and 84\u00b0 7' E., some two miles east of the road from Ballia to Sikandarpur, six miles west from Banedh and ten miles from the district headquarters. It is the principal village of the Charkaindi taluka in the tappa of Majhos, and is still in the possession of the Barwars, whose ancestors were admitted to engage at the permanent settlement. The area is 1,366 acres, and the revenue Rs. 1,332. The population of the village was 4,152 at the census of 1881, while ten years later it had risen to 4,259. In 1901, however, a decline was observed, the total being 3,957, of whom 637 were Musalmans. There are three looms, an upper primary school, and a bazar in which markets are held twice weekly. The garha cloth manufactured in the village is noted for its superior quality.\n\nKARNAL, Pargana and Tahsil BALLIA.\n\nA large and somewhat straggling village in the north-west of the pargana, lying to the west of the road from Ballia to Sikandarpur, in 25\u00b0 49' N. and 84\u00b0 6' E., at a distance of some six miles from the district headquarters. The population, which in 1881 numbered 2,807, had risen at the last census to 2,839, of whom 70 were Musalmans, while Bhuihars constitute the prevailing Hindu caste. There is a lower primary school here and a bazar in which markets are held twice a week. Tradition relates that the village was originally owned by Cheru, who were expelled above two hundred years ago by the Ujjain Rajputs under Kanwar Dhir Singh, and the story is supported by the presence of a large mound, said to be the ruins of the old Cheru fort.\nKarnai gives its name to a taluqa, which was settled in 1790 with the Raja of Halidi. The latter had previously leased it to the zamindars of Kharid, in order that they might defend his frontier against the inhabitants of Kopachit. The result was that the greater part of the estate became an uncultivated jungle; whenever any attempt was made to bring a portion under cultivation, it was immediately set upon from three sides, and the landowners of Kharid found it more profitable to retain the tract as a place of refuge. Subsequently the entire taluqa passed into the hands of the Maharaja of Dumraon, to whose estate it still belongs. The village lands cover 1,821 acres and possess a fertile soil with ample means of irrigation; the revenue is Rs. 1,540.\n\nKARON, Pargana Garha, Tahsil Ballia.\n\nA village lying in 25\u00b0 43' N. and 83\u00b0 58' E., on the road leading from Nachi to Tajpur and Ghazipur, at a distance of twelve miles west from Ballia and three miles south-east from Baragaon. Before the cession of pargana Garha to this district, Karon possessed a police station and a post-office, but since 1892 it has lost much of its importance, though it still boasts of an upper primary school and a weekly market. The population at the last census numbered 2,809 persons, of whom only 19 were Musalmans. The principal inhabitants are Brahmans and Kayasthas, of whom the former cultivate the fields, while the latter go out to seek Government and other service.\n\nThe place is chiefly noteworthy on account of the large fair which takes place on the Shooratri festival in the month of Phagan at the temple of Maharloo. It attracts some six thousand persons, many of whom come from long distances, and the gathering has grown in popularity since the opening of the railway from Ghazipur to Phopna. The shrine stands on the bank of a large and ancient tank to the north-east of the village; it covers some 52 acres and is dedicated to Kauleswar Nath. The legend states that on the banks of this tank Shiva burnt to ashes Kamdeo, the Hindu cupid, being enraged at the latter's attempts to beguile him from his meditations. From this circumstance the village is said to derive its name, Karon being popularly considered a corruption of Kam-anunya, the garden of Kamdeo. At the\nfair the offerings made at the temple consist of sweetmeats, fruit, ganja, bhang and other drugs; these are the perquisites of the Brahman priests.\n\nKATHAURA, Pargana Sikandarpur East,\nTahsil Bansdih.\n\nThe village of Kathaura, or Katbaunda, stands on the banks of the Ghagra in 28\u00b0 6' N. and 84\u00b0 2' E., at a distance of about four miles north-west from Sikandarpur, 28 miles from Ballia and 15 miles from the tahsil headquarters, the road from Bansdih to Turtipar running some two miles to the south. Kathaura belongs to tappa Haveli Kharid, and was permanently settled with Bhuinhars of the Totia subdivision, whose descendants still own the village. The lands are extensive, but much of the western half is under water, owing to the presence of a large jhil which is connected by a channel with the Ghagra. Tradition assigns the place a very early origin, as it is said that it was founded in the days of Qutb-ud-din Aibak, who conquered Bihar and Bengal in 1203. There is a large mound which is supposed to mark the site of an ancient Musalman fort, and the name of the Sultan is preserved in the hamlet of Qutbganj, which stands on the bank of the river, a short distance north of the main site. The population of the village has declined of late years, the total in 1881 being 2,406, while in 1891 it was 2,313, and at the last census 2,040, of whom all save 27 were Hindus. There is a lower primary school in Kathaura, and a small bazar in Qutbganj, which is a fort of call for the Ghagra streamers, and possesses a district board ferry over the river.\n\nKEORA, Pargana Khari, Tahsil Bansdih.\n\nA village on the south side of the road from Bansdih to Sahatwar, standing in latitude 25\u00b0 51' N. and longitude 84\u00b0 10' N., at a distance of three miles south-east from the tahsil headquarters, and about ten miles from Ballia. It forms part of tappa Bansdih, and the permanent settlement was made with Narain Rajputs, whose descendants still hold the greater part of the village. The population, which numbered 2,007 in 1881, has remained almost stationary, for at the last census there were\n2,121 inhabitants, of whom 80 were Muslims, the prevailing Hindu castes being Rajputs and Koeris. There is a bazar in which markets are held twice a week, and of late years an important cattle market has been established here; the place also contains a flourishing sugar refinery, ten looms and a lower primary school.\n\nKHAJURI, Pargana Sikandarpur-East, Tahsil Bansdih.\n\nA considerable village lying in 25\u00b0 57' N. and 84\u00b0 5' E., on the east side of the road from Ballia to Sikandarpur, at a distance of some thirteen miles from the former and twelve miles north-west from the tahsil headquarters. Like Pur and Pakri, which lies to the west, the village belongs to the Shah Salmipur tappa and was transferred from pargana Kopashit to the Azamgarh district in 1838, remaining in Sikandarpur after the amalgamation of the latter with Ballia in 1879. The permanent settlement was made with Sengar Rajputs, and the village continued in their possession till 1812, when it was sold by auction. The purchasers could not obtain possession until troops were sent to install them by force; but the old proprietors soon afterwards recovered the estate by a decree of the Sadri Diwani Adalat of Calcutta cancelling the sale. The Sengars are still in possession, but they are said to be of mixed descent; they pay a revenue of Rs. 1,597 on a total area of 1,974 acres. The population of Khajuri in 1881 numbered 2,782 souls, while at the last census it had risen to 2,960, of whom 192 were Muslims. The village contains a bazar in which markets are held twice a week, eight sugar refineries, and nine looms.\n\nKHARAUNI, Pargana Kharid, Tahsil Bansdih.\n\nKharauni, also known as Rajayon, is a large village lying in 25\u00b0 54' N. and 84\u00b0 15' E., at a distance of about three miles to the north-east of Bansdih, twelve miles from the district headquarters, and some two miles from Husainabad, the lands of which adjoin Kharauni on the east. The population was 3,350 in 1881, and 3,306 ten years later, while in 1901 the village contained 3,496 inhabitants, of whom only 114 were Muslims. It is a flourishing place, with a sugar factory, two looms, and\nan upper primary school. The area of the village is 1,556 acres and the revenue Rs. 1,364. The proprietors are Narauni Rajputs, whose ancestors obtained the engagement for the whole of the Kharauni taluka, a portion of tappa Bansdih, at the permanent settlement. In 1804 the Naraunis obtained possession of an extensive alluvial tract, known as the Kharauni Daira, the right to which had been unsuccessfully contested by certain zamindars of Saran. This land became the subject of disputes between the co-sharers, and the sanguinary contests which ensued led to the attachment of the whole taluka in 1822. It remained under direct management till 1904, when it was restored to the former proprietors. The existence of the alternative name of Rajugaon is ascribed to a local superstition, according to which it is considered unlucky to pronounce the name of Kharauni, the supposition being that if any one utters the word in the morning, he will be unfortunate during the whole day.\n\nKHARID, Pargana Sikandarpur East, Tehsil Bansdih.\n\nThe village which gives its name to the pargana of Kharid now lies beyond its boundaries in Sikandarpur east, to which the old tappa of Haveli Kharid has belonged since 1838. It is a small and unimportant place, lying in $26^\\circ 3' \\text{N.}$ and $84^\\circ 8' \\text{E.}$, at a distance of four miles east from Sikandarpur and 24 miles from Ballia, between the banks of the Ghagra and the road from Bansdih to Sikandarpur and Turtipur. It contained at the last census a population of 963 persons, the majority of whom are of the Ahir caste. The village itself possesses nothing of any importance, but it adjoins Parsotam Patti, a hamlet to the east where there is a district board ferry over the Ghagra; Qasipur, a village to the south with a market twice a week; and Zahidipur, which lies to the west and is the scene of a considerable fair in honour of Makhdum Sahib, a Musalman saint whose shrine stands here, close to the river bank.\n\nKharid is only noteworthy on account of its historical associations, and these are of a very vague description. Tradition relates that there was here an old city named Ghazanfarabad, which was washed away, it is supposed, by the Ghagra, the inhabitants migrating to Patna. In its place Sikandar Lodi\nbuilt the town of Sikandarpur, but the history of this period is far from clear, as an inscribed slab, now fixed in the walls of the mausoleum of Rukn-ud-din Rukn Alam in Kharid, states that in 1527 Khan-i-azam Khan was nukhtar of Kharid in the dominions of Nasrat Shah, one of the Sultans of Bengal, and built a mosque in Kharid. The old town may be represented by mounds which are to be found on either side of the Ghagra and stretch for a considerable distance, but they have never been explored.\n\nThe same Khan-i-azam is connected with a popular legend which accounts for the name of Kharid, which in the Persian signifies \"purchased.\" It was in the days of Ala-ud-din Husain Shah, the predecessor of Nasrat Shah, that a merchant came from Kashmir, bringing with him seventy camels laden with the finest saffron. He had registered a vow that he would only sell the entire quantity to a single purchaser and receive as the price only money coined in a single year. Such terms as these were not to be fulfilled immediately, and so the merchant wandered far on his travels till he came to the court of Khan-i-azam. There his taunts at the poverty of the great king of Bengal and his nobles aroused the Khan, who purchased the whole of the saffron and paid for it in the prescribed coin. He then mixed all the saffron with the mortar which had been prepared for building the mosque, and the Sultan, in recognition of his generous conduct, bestowed on him a robe of honour, bidding the place in future be known as Kharid.\n\nKHARID Pargana, Tahsil Bansdih.\n\nThis pargana comprises the eastern and larger portion of the Bansdih tahsil, extending from Sikandarpur East and Kopachit East on the west to Doaba on the east. To the south lies pargana Ballia, while on the north and north-east the river Ghagra separates it from the Saran district of Bengal. The deep stream throughout forms the boundary, and its vagaries result in considerable variations in the total area from time to time, though to a less extent perhaps than is the case in the parganas along the Ganges. The area in 1906 was 155,097 acres, the average for five years being 158,003 acres or 246.9 square miles.\nDifferent parts of the pargana exhibit very diverse physical characteristics. The western and southern portions are included in the upland tract, and here the soil is generally loam, stiffening into clay in the numerous depressions. These uplands extend eastwards from the boundary of Sikandarpur, in the north reaching to the banks of the Ghagra, which at Allahgarh near Maniar are of a permanent nature owing to the presence of a great konker reef. From a short distance beyond that point the high bank curves inland as far as the large semi-circular jhil known as the Mundari Dah, between Maniar and Bansdih. The uplands thence consist of a comparatively narrow tongue of land reaching to a point beyond Sahatwar, and terminating at the Reoti Dah. Their southern border is approximately marked by the line of railway and by the northern edge of the great Suraha Tal. The rest of the pargana is composed of alluvial deposit of varying age. The older formation is no longer liable to change, and has a stiff clay soil of considerable fertility; the surface of the country is covered in every direction by old channels and watercourses, which presumably mark former beds of the Ghagra. In the neighbourhood of that river we find a more recent alluvium, subject to constant inundations and generally possessing a sandy soil, the deposit of this river being at all times less valuable than that of the Ganges. This fluvial tract contains many sotus and backwaters of the Ghagra, the most important of which is that known as the Tengraha. There are altogether 37 villages immediately affected by the river, but many of these are permanently settled, and only 19 mahals are subject to periodical revision of assessment.\n\nOwing to its physical position the cultivated area of the pargana varies considerably with the nature of the season, as long-continued floods in the low lands necessarily result in a contraction of the rabi area. During the five years ending in 1906 on an average 105,930 acres or 67 per cent. of the whole were under tillage, this proportion being very similar to that of Sikandarpur East. The barren area is large, amounting to 31,112 acres or 19.8 per cent., but of this as much as 13,746 acres is under water, and 4,117 acres are occupied by sites, roads and buildings; the actually uncultivable area thus amounts to 18,056 acres\u2014a\nfigure which is only approached in Doaba, and, as in that pargana, is due to the large extent of unfertile sand along the Ghagra. Much of the cultivable waste is of a very similar description, though deductions should be made on account of 4,364 acres of new fallow and of no less than 7,688 acres of groves; the latter amounts to 4-8 per cent. of the entire pargana, which is an unusually large proportion for this district. Save in the uplands, very little irrigation is required, and on an average only 27 per cent. of the cultivation is artificially watered. Wells constitute the principal source of supply, and can be made without difficulty wherever their construction is needed. A certain amount of irrigation is obtained from tanks, and also from the jhils and minor watercourses, such as the Baheri and several others which traverse the uplands from west to east. The kharif harvest exceeds the rabi in point of area, the former covering on an average 69,429, and the latter 65,138 acres; double-cropping is extensively practised, and the custom of taking two harvests of the land in the same year is growing rapidly, the present average being some 28 per cent. of the net cultivation. The chief kharif crops are rice and kodon, each of which averages some 27 per cent. of the area sown, and after these come maize with 17-5 per cent. and sugarcane with 13 per cent., the latter being mainly confined to the higher lands. Barley is the chief rabi staple, and when sown alone constitutes 25-4 per cent. of the harvest. A considerable amount is also grown in combination with gram and wheat, while the area under wheat by itself is steadily increasing. Peas cover some 14 per cent., but this proportion is low for the district; there is also a fair amount of opium cultivation, which averages some 880 acres.\n\nAmong the cultivators Rajputs predominate, but are somewhat closely followed by Brahmans, and after these come Koiris, Ahirs, Kayasthas and Bhumihars. The prevalence of high caste tenants affects not only the rental, but also the standard of husbandry, which is probably inferior to that attained in other parts of the district. Some 31 per cent. of the land is included in proprietary holdings, either as sir or khuddehsh, 15-5 per cent. is held by tenants at fixed rates, 33 per cent. by occupancy tenants, and 14-4 per cent. by tenants-at-will; the remainder is either\nex-proprietary sir, or else held rent-free, the latter tenure being unusually common and extending to over 5,000 acres or nearly half the rent-free area of the district. No less than 40 per cent. of the land included in holdings is sublet, this being the highest proportion in the district. About 2,400 acres are grain-rented, consisting of rice land on the borders of jhils, in which the outturn is always precarious. The average cash rental at the present time ranges from Rs. 4-10-7 per acre for alieni tenants to Rs. 3-3-4 per acre for tenants at fixed rates and Rs. 3-10-0 for those with rights of occupancy. Tenants-at-will pay only Rs. 3-1-6 per acre, but, as is usually the case, they generally hold the worst land, all that of a superior quality having been long ago appropriated, either for sir or by the old statutory tenants.\n\nThe present revenue demand for the pargana, including that of the temporary mahals, stands at Rs. 1,15,817, and to this an addition of Rs. 19,362 may be made on account of cesses. There are 556 villages in the pargana, and these are subdivided into 943 mahals. Of the latter, excluding the 19 temporarily assessed, 261 are owned by single proprietors, 1,445 are joint samindari, 10 are khaiyachara, 123 are perfect pattidari, and 429 are held in the imperfect variety of the same tenure. Of the various proprietary castes, Rajputs hold nearly 66 per cent. of the land, and next to them come Bhininhars with 15-5 per cent., Brahmins with eight per cent., Kayasthas with five per cent., and Musalmans with nearly two per cent., the small remainder being held by other Hindus. Among the chief proprietors are the Maharaja of Qasim Bazar, who owns 7,579 acres revenue-free, this forming a portion of the Kanta Babu jagir; the Naraini Rajputs of Banadilh, the Pandes of Bairia and Reoti, the Kinwars of Sahatwar, and the Barwars of Jagirsand.\n\nThe population of pargana Kharid in 1881 numbered 180,407, but this dropped to 176,027 in 1891. At the last census there was a complete recovery, the total number of inhabitants being 190,382, of whom 181,814 were Hindus, 8,531 Musalmans, and 37 of other religions. The pargana contains the four towns of Banadilh, Sahatwar, Maniar and Reoti, while in addition to these there are several large villages such as Gaighat, Chandpur,\nSultanpur, Sukhpura, Mairitar, Karammar, Kharauni, Balupur and several others. Few of them are of any importance, being merely overgrown agricultural communities. The southern portion of the pargana is well provided with means of communications, but elsewhere the roads are few and inferior. The railway from Mau and Ballia to Revolganj passes close to Sahatwar and Rooti, while a metalled road connects Bansdih with Bansdih Road station, some five miles south of the town, and with the district headquarters. The chief unmetalled road is that from Bairia to Rooti, Sahatwar, Bansdih, Maniar and Sikandarpur. Others run from Sahatwar to Chandpura, Haldi and Ballia, and from Bansdih to Garwar, the latter crossing the road from Ballia to Sikandarpur at Sukhpura in the extreme south-western corner. At present a project is on foot to open up the pargana by carrying a branch line of railway through the northern portion, so as to reach Maniar and the important markets on the Ghagra.\n\nKharid takes its name from a small village now lying in pargana Sikandarpur East. The tappa of Haveli Kharid was transferred to Sikandarpur as long ago as 1837, with the exception of a single mahal known as Balupur and the three villages of Hathunuj, Mundiali and Barsari, belonging to the Kautu Baba jagir. The rest was originally divided into the tappas of Bansdih, Rooti, Sahatwar, Maniar and Majhos. The last still gives its name to a taluqdar, but the terppa, also called Charkaind, is now absorbed in Maniar and Bansdih. These tappas usually represented the area held by a clan of Rajputs, and they are subdivided into taluqdas and pattas, which generally take their names from the original founder of a particular branch of the clan. The taluqdas do not comprise the whole tappas, for in almost every case there are several independent manzils, while in some instances certain areas are still held in common, the most notable example being the town of Bansdih. The tenures are often extremely complex, some mahals being spread over a large number of manzils, while on the other hand a manzil is frequently divided into an equally large number of mahals. A detailed account of the proprietary right in the pargana is given in Mr. Roberts' settlement report. Briefly it may be said that tappas Maniar and Majhos belong to the Barwars, Bansdih to the Naraunis, Rooti to the Nikumbhas,\nand Sahatwar to the Kirwars, while Balipur is the property of Kayasthas. This was the arrangement at the time of the permanent settlement, but there have been many subsequent alienations, especially in the case of Reoti, where the Nikumbhas have lost most of their property, and in Bansdih, where a whole taluka is owned by the descendants of Deokinandan Singh. The remarkable history of Maniar will be found in the article on that place.\n\n**KHARSANDA, Pargana Sikandarpur East, Tahsil Bansdih.**\n\nA village on the eastern borders of the pargana, lying in 25\u00b0 56' N. and 84\u00b0 5' E., a short distance to the east of the road from Ballia to Sikandarpur, eight miles from Bansdih, and about twelve miles from the district headquarters. It contained at the last census a population of 2,813 persons, of whom 433 were Musalmans. There is a lower primary school, and in the village are four looms and five sugar refineries. Markets are held twice a week in the bazar, and a considerable trade is carried on in leather and other articles. The area of Kharsanda, sometimes written Kharega, is 1,890 acres, and the revenue Rs. 1,837. The principal inhabitants are Barwar Rajputs, whose ancestors held the place at the time of the permanent settlement. They fell into arrears, however, and in 1832 the entire estate was sold, the purchaser being the Maharaja of Dumraon, in the possession of whose heirs it has since remained.\n\n**KOPACHIT EAST Pargana, Tahsil Ballia.**\n\nThis pargana, which was united with Kopachit West till the formation of the Ballia district in 1879, comprises the north-western portion of the headquarters tahsil, and consists of a long and narrow tract bounded on the north by Sikandarpur East, on the west by Lakhnassar, on the east by Kharid and Ballia, and on the south by Garha, the boundary in the south-western corner marching for a short distance with that of the Ghazipur district. The total area in 1906 was 44,600 acres or 69.7 square miles.\n\nThe tract is divided into two portions by the Sarju river, which passes through southern half of the pargana in a south-easterly direction as far as the town of Baragon; there it turns east and then bends south again towards the borders of pargana.\nBallia. The Sarju is fed by the Budhi, which enters the pargana on the western boundary and flows in a very tortuous course, roughly parallel to the railway. Along the northern border, separating it from Sikandarpur East, flows an irregular chain of swamps known as the Bahori Tal; while the central portion drains eastwards towards the Suraha lake. The entire pargana is included in the upland tract, and is a fertile and highly cultivated stretch of country. There is a fair amount of water in the southern half, especially along the Budhi; and this river, as well as the Sarju, is liable to overflow its banks in wet years and to inundate the neighbouring rice fields.\n\nThe average cultivated area for the last five years is 33,429 acres or 75 per cent. of the whole, and the annual variations are very slight. The land classed as barren amounts to 32 per cent., of which 1,548 acres are under water and 1,761 acres occupied by villages, roads, and the like. The remaining 7,136 acres are shown as culturable, but this includes no less than 1,834 acres of groves, which amount to 4-1 per cent. of the whole pargana or almost the highest average in the district, and about a thousand acres of new fallow; the rest is of little value, except perhaps as grazing land. Means of irrigation are abundant, as is the case throughout the upland; the annual average area watered by artificial means amounts to 15,872 acres or nearly 48 per cent. of the cultivation. The greater portion of this is served by wells, to the extent of 87 per cent., and the bulk of the remainder is supplied from tanks, though the natural watercourses are utilized in a number of villages. The kharif area slightly exceeds that sown in the rabi, the figures being 21,221 and 19,750 acres respectively, while some 23 per cent. bears a double crop, this proportion being practically identical with that obtained in Kopachit West and Lakhnassar. The chief kharif staples are rice, averaging 17-1 per cent. of the harvest; sugarcane 16-2 per cent.; and kodon 10-9 per cent., the remainder consisting of arhar, maize, jowar and bajra. The area under sugarcane is remarkably large, as is also the case in western Kopachit, these two parganas producing a relatively larger amount than any other. In the rabi barley takes the lead with 37 per cent. of the area sown, and after this come peas with 25 per cent., gram with 20 per cent., and wheat with 11\nper cent. There is a fair amount of opium cultivation, which averages some 330 acres.\n\nThe chief cultivating castes are Rajputs, Ahirs, Koeris, Chamars, Brahmans and Bhars. The Rajputs belong mainly to the Karcholia, Kansik, Bisen and Barwar clan, the first largely preponderating. Proprietors have some 83 per cent. of the area in their own cultivation, either as sir or khudkhasht. They have increased the amount of late years, mainly at the expense of the old tenants at fixed rates, who have been almost crushed out in this pargana and now hold no more than six per cent. Occupancy tenants cultivate 47 per cent., and tenants-at-will nearly 15 per cent., the remainder being held by ex-proprietary tenants or else rent-free. Some 26 per cent. of the land is sublet, and these shilmi tenants pay on an average Rs. 6-2-0 per acre. The rate for tenants at fixed rates is Rs. 3-5-0, that of occupancy tenants Rs. 3-13-7, and that of tenants-at-will Rs. 3-13-10, the slight difference being due to the fact that the unprivileged classes can only obtain the more inferior lands. These rates are subject to enhancement in the case of sugarcane cultivation, the increase being known as beshi ukh. Some reference has been made to this special rate in chapter III; it varies in different villages, but the general rule is that no rent is paid for the first year when the land is fallow and prepared for cane, while in the second year three times the ordinary rent is collected. If sugarcane is grown without a previous fallow year, the ordinary rental demand is increased by 50 per cent. The revenue demand now stands at Rs. 49,031, exclusive of cesses which contribute an additional Rs. 5,927. There are in all 214 villages in the pargana, and these are divided into 1,508 mahals. Of the latter, 214 are held by single proprietors, 244 are joint zamindars, 404 perfect pattidari, and the remaining 646 imperfect pattidari; as in Kopachit West, the bhayatchara form of tenure is unknown.\n\nThe pargana is said to have been originally held by Cherus, to whom are ascribed the extensive ruins at Pakka Kot and the traces of old sites to be found in several other villages. Subsequently the Cherus were displaced by Rajputs of the Sonbarsi clan, known as Karcholias and Kansiks, the former holding the north and west of the pargana, comprised in the taluks of\nRatsand and Garwar, while the latter occupied the country south of the Sarju, which is divided into the two taluqas of Chit and Firozpur. Several villages in the north are owned by Bisons, while the taluqa of Shah Salempur, now a tehsil of Sikandrarpur East, but formerly a part of this pargana, is held by a branch of the Seugars. This territorial arrangement existed at the time of the permanent settlement, but in subsequent years several large areas were sold for arrears of revenue. The principal purchasers were Deekinandan Singh and his son, Janki Prasad, who bought Garwar and some 13 other villages, most of which still remain in the possession of their descendants, and are managed together with the rest of their property by the Court of Wards. All the Kansik estates, too, were sold and purchased by the Pandes of Bairia. The latter were unable to gain possession, as the Kansiks offered open resistance and in 1840 murdered the agent of the auction purchaser, for which crime 37 of them were sentenced to imprisonment for life and sent to the Allipur jail. A manager was then appointed by Government with a strong force of police to support him, but the old proprietors continued to give much trouble and many endeavours were made, but without success, to induce the Pandes to relinquish their purchase. During the mutiny the Kansiks openly rebelled and long resisted all attempts to restore order. Eventually the Pandes agreed to sell the estate for Rs. 44,000 in 1858, some of the money being raised by the Kansiks themselves and the rest borrowed from local money-lenders. Most of the debt has been paid off, although a share in both taluqas has passed into the possession of the mahajans. The restoration of the land has been attended with the happiest results and the Kansiks are now peaceable as any of the zamindars in the district. At the present time 64 per cent. of the pargana is owned by Rajputs, ten per cent. by Bhumhars, nine per cent. by Brahmans, six per cent. by Musalmans, and the rest by other Hindus.\n\nThe population of the pargana numbered 60,000 at the census of 1891, and ten years later the total had risen to 62,174. The last enumeration in 1901 showed a slight decline, the number of inhabitants being 61,645, of whom 4,276 were Musalmans. The chief places in the pargana include the town of Baragon, and\nthe large villages of Ratsand and Garwar, which have been separately described, as also has Phophna, an important road and railway junction. The pargana derives its name from Kopa or Kopwa, a village near the Sarju, and from Chit, now generally known as Baragaon. The tract is well provided with means of communication, for through the centre runs the railway from Ballia to Mau, with a station at Phophna, from which a branch line leads to Baragaon and Ghazipur. From Phophna metalled roads run to Ballia, Rasra and Ghazipur, the latter having a branch communicating with Baragaon station. Several unmetalled roads radiate from Garwar, two of them connecting with the Rasra road at Phophna and Piaria, while others run north to Khajuri and Sikandarpur, north-east to Bansdih, and north-west to Nagra. The Sarju is crossed on the main road by a temporary pile bridge, which is replaced during the rains by a ferry.\n\nKOPACHIT WEST Pargana, Tahsil Rasra.\n\nOn the formation of the district in 1879, the western half of the old Kopachit pargana was left in the Rasra tahsil, while the rest was assigned to Ballia. Kopachit West occupies the south-eastern corner of the tahsil, and consists of a pear-shaped tract of country, bounded on the north by the two parganas of Sikandarpur, on the west by Lakhnesar, on the east and south-east by the rest of Kopachit, and on the south, for a very short distance, by the Ghazipur district. As at present constituted, it has a total area of 37,602 acres or 58\u00b77 square miles.\n\nLike Kopachit East, the pargana lies wholly in the upland tract. The chief drainage line is the Sarju, which for a short distance forms the southern boundary and then enters the pargana at Nasirpur; after flowing northwards for two miles, it again turns east at the old fort of Gaurai and then passes into Kopachit East. The north and central tract is traversed by the Budhi, a small and tortuous stream which enters the pargana at the extreme north-western corner and thence flows in a south-easterly direction past Hajauli to leave the pargana at the large village of Aunsi, to the south of Chilkubir railway station. The Budhi is usually of insignificant dimensions, but during the\nrains it attains a considerable volume, flooding the rice lands along its banks. In some instances this is led to saturation, and the result is to be seen in patches of barren land. Generally, however, the pargana is fertile, the soil being for the most part a light loam, though this changes to clay in the depressions. The latter are most numerous in the north and west, where there is a string of jhils leading eastwards towards the Suraha Tal; the largest are to be found in the villages of Saun, Indarpar and Asanwar.\n\nIn the matter of general development the pargana is inferior to Kopachit East. During the five years ending in 1906 the average cultivated area was 24,732 acres or 65.8 per cent. of the whole, 8,658 acres being classed as culturable, and 4,212 acres or 11 percent. as barren. The actually uncultivable area is very small, for 3,273 acres are either under water or occupied by villages, sites, roads, railway and the like. Similarly of the culturable area 904 acres are grove land and 1,306 acres are now fallow, while much of the remainder is either covered with dhak jungle or else is of so inferior a nature that it would never repay tillage. As regards irrigation the pargana is as well provided as any other in the district, for no less than 59 per cent. of the cultivation obtains water. Wells constitute the chief source of supply, but there is a large number of tanks, which are extensively utilized. The chief kharif staple is rice, accounting for nearly 44 per cent. of the area sown in that harvest, and next comes sugarcane with 17 per cent., the highest proportion in the district; the other crops comprise jodom, urhar, juar and bajra. In the rabi barley and peas constitute 42 and 34.5 per cent. of the area respectively, while wheat and gram make up most of the balance. On an average, 17,373 acres are cultivated in the kharif, and 13,015 acres in the rabi, the double-cropped area being 5,081 acres or 23 per cent. of the land under the plough.\n\nThe cultivating castes are the same as those found in Kopachit East. At the present time 33 per cent. of the land is included in proprietary holdings, either as sir or khudkhasht, 44 per cent. held by occupancy tenants, 16 per cent. by tenants-at-will, and only five per cent. by tenants at fixed rates. This last class has almost disappeared, as is also the case in Kopachit East, for in these\nparganas the zamindars have been particularly successful in their attempts to extinguish tenancies of this nature. Much of the proprietary cultivation is sublet, while tenants holding nearly 21 per cent. of the total area. They pay on an average Rs. 8-1-7 per acre, as compared with Rs. 2-15-0 paid by tenants-at-fixed rates, Rs. 4-1-5 by occupancy tenants and Rs. 8-15-11 by tenants-at-will.\n\nThe present revenue demand for the pargana is Rs. 29,005, this sum excluding cesses, which aggregate Rs. 3,940. There are 184 villages, now divided into 923 mahals. Of the latter no fewer than 657 are held in joint zamindari tenure, while 183 are single zamindari, 112 perfect and 61 imperfect pattidars. Rajputs own 52 per cent. of the land, Brahmins ten per cent., Bhumihar nine per cent., Musalmans seven per cent., while Kayasths and other Hindus are in possession of the remainder. In former days almost the entire area was owned by the Karcholia Rajputs, who still retain the large talukas of Hajauli and Chilkahar, the former being represented by Baba Har Charan Singh and the latter by Baba Mahadeo Prasad Singh. Between the permanent settlement and that of 1840 several villages were sold on account of arrears, the chief purchaser being Janki Prasad, the son of the notorious amil Deokranandan. These are still held by his descendants and are now under the management of the Court of Wards. A portion of Hajauli, too, was purchased by the Musalman Imqis of Rasna, but in Chilkahar the Karcholias have managed to retain practically the whole of their ancestral possessions.\n\nThe population of the pargana rose from 39,888 in 1881 to 41,725 at the following census. In 1901 it was found that there had been a slight decline, the number of inhabitants being 40,914, of whom 3,017 were Musalmans. There is no town in the pargana, though several villages have large populations, such as Hajauli, Damri, Aundi and Chilkahar. The last-named place is important as possessing a railway station on the line from Ballia to Mau. Parallel to the line on the south runs the metalled road from Ballia to Rasna, crossing the Budhi by a bridge. The unmetalled roads from Garwar to Nagra and Sikandarpur serve the north and west of the pargana, and that from Pinria to Dehna in Ghazipur traverses the south-eastern corner.\nKORANTADIH, Pargana Garha, Tahsil Ballia.\n\nThis place was selected in 1876 as the headquarters of a tahsil in the Ghazipur district, and so remained till the transfer of pargana Garha to Ballia in 1892. Two years later, when the encroachments of the Ganges washed away the district courts and offices at Ballia, the selection of Korantadih for their location again brought the place into an ephemeral prominence. It stands in $25^\\circ 35' N.$ and $83^\\circ 59' E.$, on the banks of the Ganges and close to the metalled road from Ballia to Ghazipur, 23 miles distant from the former. There is practically no village of Korantadih, and the population of 87 souls at the last census was composed solely of officials. Hard by to the east lie the adjacent villages of Sarayan and Ujjar, with a combined total of 3,123 inhabitants. Korantadih still possesses a police-station, post-office, cattle-pound, and a lower primary school. The excellent house on the bank of the river, till 1873 the residence of the officer in charge of the Government stud and subsequently from 1894 to 1902 occupied by the collector of the district, is maintained as an inspection bungalow. Most of the other buildings have been dismantled, but the treasury and record-rooms have been left, in recognition of the possibility of again establishing a tahsil here. Opposite Korantadih is the town of Buxar in Shahabad, access to which is obtained by the Ujjar ferry.\n\nKOTWA, Pargana Doaba, Tahsil Ballia.\n\nThe village of Kotwa lies in $25^\\circ 47' N.$ and $84^\\circ 30' E.$, some two miles north of Bairia and 22 miles from the district headquarters, on the road leading from the former place to Suremanpur railway station. The road crosses the Bhagur nala by a bridge, the cost of which was raised by subscriptions through the agency of a noted Gosain of the place, Sudhakar Babin by name. He used to live in a mango grove adjoining the important bazar of Raniganj, and a fair is held annually in his honour during the month of Aghan, attended by about 20,000 persons from the neighbourhood. Some reference to this gathering has been made in Chapter II. The bazar of Raniganj is the most important market in this part of the district, and from it nearly all the\nvillage of the pargana derive their supplies of grain and cloth. It is surrounded, save at one corner where a dispute has arisen regarding the land, by a high wall, and in the centre is a well with masonry shops on either side. Raniganj is one of many hamlets which make up the village of Kotwa. The place is included in tahsil Damodarpur, and belongs to the Durnaon estate. It was formerly held by Lohatama Rajputs, who are the principal inhabitants. The population, which numbered 3,144 in 1881 and 2,848 in 1891, amounted at the last census to 2,865 persons, of whom 147 were Musalmans. The village was the first place in this district to be attacked by plague, which made its appearance in 1901 and was imported from Revelganj.\n\nLAKHNESAR, Pargana LAKHNESAR, Tahsil Rasra.\n\nThe pargana of Lakhnesar derives its name from a small and practically deserted village standing on the left bank of the Sarju in 25\u00b0 48' N. and 83\u00b0 49' E., at a distance of some five miles south-west from Rasra. The place, which is generally known as Lakhnesar Dih, is called after Lakhman, the brother of Ram Chandra, the tradition being that the former built a temple here in honour of Mahadeo. It is at least evident from this tradition that Lakhnesar is a place of great antiquity. The remains of an ancient town are still to be seen on the high bank of the river, in the shape of immense piles of rubbish, from which numerous pieces of sculpture have from time to time been obtained. According to the local legend the place was a stronghold of the Bihars, and these people were dispossessed by the Sengars, who afterwards made Rasra their home. At the present time Lakhnesar Dih is quite insignificant, and at the last census the sole inhabitants were two Fagirs, who resided at the shrine of an old Muhammadan saint, in whose honour a small fair is held here annually in the beginning of August.\n\nLAKHNESAR Pargana, Tahsil Rasra.\n\nThis pargana occupies the south central portion of the tahsil, being bounded on the south by the Ghazipur district, on the east by Kapachit West, and on the north and west by Sikundarpur. In many respects it is one of the most interesting\nparganas of the district by reason of its fiscal and general history, and is further of importance as possessing the town of Rasra, in which are located the tahsil headquarters. The pargana is, however, of small dimensions, having at the present time a total area of 34,383 acres or 53\u00b77 square miles.\n\nLakhnesar lies wholly in the upland portion of the district, and is a tract of a generally homogeneous character. The soil, however, varies in nature, from a light sandy loam along the high bank of the Sarju in the south, where the crops depend chiefly on the rainfall, to a stiff rice-producing clay in the numerous depressions. While most of the pargana has a loam soil, there is a large proportion of clay, and in several places there are stretches of unculturable land. This is the result of saturation, for the drainage in the interior is often defective, notably in the neighbourhood of Rasra, where a drainage scheme is under consideration. The project involves a cut to relieve the water-logged lands surrounding the town, leading southwards into the string of jhils known as the Taleji Tal, and thence into the Sarju. The latter is the chief drainage line, the others belonging to the very imperfect systems known as the Basnahi and Lakra in the extreme north, which eventually form the stream called the Bodhi. The country is well wooded, and near Rasra is the only patch of tree jungle in the district, surrounding the shrine of Nath Baba.\n\nOwing to the large extent of uncultivable land, the pargana has failed to attain as high a state of development as the other parts of the district. The land under cultivation amounts to 22,128 acres or 64\u00b74 per cent. of the whole area, this figure being the average of the returns for the past five years. Of the remainder, 3,657 acres or 10\u00b70 per cent. are returned as barren, and 8,507 acres or 25 per cent. as culturable waste. The former for the most part comprises land under water or occupied by villages and roads, as only 422 acres are shown as actually uncultivable. This does not, however, properly represent the state of affairs, as a far larger area is really unfit for cultivation. Excluding groves, which cover 991 acres, and new fallow, 1,657 acres, there remain nearly 6,000 acres of old fallow and so-called culturable waste, though the bulk of this consists of unir and dhak jungle which would never repay a tillage. The kharif is the more\nimportant harvest and occupies a much greater area than the rabi, the averages being 15,680 and 11,351 acres respectively. In former days the difference was even more marked, for of late years the double-cropped area has rapidly increased, and now averages 4,496 acres or 22.3 per cent. of the cultivation. The proportion is low for this district, and is indeed exceeded in every pargana save Sikandrapur East. The principal, heavy staples are rice, which accounts for 45 per cent. of the harvest, and sugarcane, 18.5 per cent.; the rest consists chiefly of other, varieties, and other small millets. Barley averages 52.4 per cent. of the rabi area, and after this come peas with 30.8 per cent. Wheat and gram constitute the bulk of the remainder, but in either case the proportion is much lower than in any other part of the district. As a matter of fact, Lakhnesar is probably the poorest of all the Ballia parganas, and this contention is emphasized by the inferiority of the crops grown. Means of irrigation are generally ample, and on an average 70 per cent. of the cultivation obtains water, though even this is a lower figure than those of the neighbouring tracts. Wells form the chief source of supply, and less than 14 per cent. of the irrigation is obtained from other sources; artificial tanks are fairly numerous, but there is a general absence of natural reservoirs for the purpose.\n\nAt the same time the low standard of agriculture may be largely attributed to the composition of the agricultural community. Practically all the land is in the hands of high-caste cultivators, more than 50 per cent. being held as sir and khudkush. Tenants at fixed rates are quite unknown in this pargana, as in former days the entire area was nominally sir; but at the present time the occupancy tenants have 27 per cent. of the land in their possession, though the majority of these are also zamindars. Save for insignificant areas held rent-free or by ex-proprietors, the remainder of the pargana is cultivated by tenants-at-will. A considerable proportion of the sir land is sublet, amounting in all to nearly 21 per cent. of the entire area included in holdings. The rent-rates are high, sirwais on an average paying Rs. 6-9-7 per acre, occupancy tenants Rs. 5-6-5 and others Rs. 5-8-6. The revenue demand for the pargana is Rs. 10,510, while cesses amount to a further Rs. 3,850. The incidence is the lightest in\nthe district, though this is a result rather of the peculiar history of the pargana than of a recognition of its inferior capacities.\n\nThe population in 1831 numbered 52,677 souls, and ten years later the total dropped to 52,136. There was a further decline at the last census of 1901, when the number of inhabitants was 49,662, of whom 42,947 were Hindus, 6,570 Musalmans and 116 of other religions. The prevailing castes are Rajputs, almost exclusively of the Sengar clan, Banias, Bhars, Chamars and Brahmans. The most important place in the pargana is Rasra, a thriving town and the chief business centre of the district. Among the larger villages mention may be made of Nagpura, Tika Door, Jam and Athila. The tract is well provided with means of communication, for through the centre runs the railway from Mau to Ballia with a station at Rasra, which is also connected with the district headquarters by a metalled road. Other roads lead from Rasra to Nagra, Halidharpur, Dehna and Ghazipur.\n\nThe pargana derives its name from a small and now uninhabited village called Lakhnesar Dih, which stands on the banks of the Sarju in its south-eastern corner. It is said that the country was formerly occupied by the Bhars, and these people were expelled by Sengar Rajputs, who came from the Etawah district. The Sengars subsequently took up their headquarters at Rasra and obtained possession of the entire pargana, which has continued in the hands of this clan unto the present day.\n\nTheir history is remarkable, for at all times they were renowned for their strength and courage, but on no occasion do they seem to have had a common Raja, the republican nature of their institutions being illustrated by the fact that the 537 mahals into which the pargana is now divided are all held in khajancha tenure. Nevertheless, their union was so complete that the Sengars were the only clan who preserved their proprietary rights intact. In 1761, when the management of the Benares province was made over by the Nawab Wazir to Balwant Singh, the latter tried to introduce the same system of village management which he had established elsewhere. The experiment was a total failure, for the authority of the amil was set at naught, with the result that about 1764 the Raji came with a strong force, to\nwhich the Rajputs only submitted after a sanguinary fight near Rasra. A compromise was then effected, by which a fixed revenue of Rs. 20,501 was imposed on the pargana, which the Sangars were to manage in their own fashion. They had their own revenue collector, and the distribution of the demand was effected by themselves without any interference on the part of the Government. When Mr. Duncan assumed control of Benares the Sangars were considered the most independent and troublesome of all the subjects of the Company, and in 1793 they actually attacked the Resident's bodyguard when he visited the pargana. The offence was afterwards condoned, and the same arrangement was permitted to continue with regard to the revenue. The Sangars nevertheless fell into arrears in 1796, in which year Dookiwanan Singh assumed office as tahsildar. It was proposed to sell the rights and interests of the four chauhdhis of the clan, but the Sangars resisted, and eventually the judge of Ghazipur decided that the chauhdhis were not liable in the absence of any agreement on their part to be responsible for the payment of the revenue. Accordingly in 1799 it was resolved to make a detailed settlement of the pargana, and the collector was given the assistance of a military force to overcome opposition. There was no intention of increasing the amount of the revenue, but none the less the collector set himself to obtain an enhancement, beginning with a grain settlement at half rates. This was disallowed by Government, and was followed by a village settlement, though the zamindars refused to engage and almost the whole pargana was given in farm. This arrangement was also cancelled, and finally in August 1800 the collector induced the chauhdhis and others to agree to pay an enhanced revenue of Rs. 40,738. Even then no separate village agreements were taken, the tract being merely divided into 28 mahals. The settlement was reluctantly sanctioned by Government in 1801, but the enhanced revenue was never paid, with the result that the sale of the whole pargana was proposed and ultimately permitted. The sale actually took place, the purchaser being the Raja of Benares, who attempted to gain possession by means of a large semi-military force, though without much success. In 1802 the Raja was requested to\nrelinquish the purchase, and the former sale and settlement were cancelled, orders being given that a detailed village settlement should be formed, without increasing the demand assessed by Mr. Duncan. This settlement was carried out by Mr. Barton, collector of Ghazipur, the original demand of Rs. 20,501 being maintained, with the deduction of Rs. 1,643, of which Rs. 1,200 were on account of the tahsildar's salary, Rs. 215 as the allowance of the sarishtadar and Rs. 228 as the number of the samindars; the net revenue payable to Government being Rs. 18,858. By this settlement the pargana was divided into 35 mahals, but no care was taken that each mahal should comprise the whole of one or several villages. Ostensibly this appears to have been done, but in fact the mahals are inextricably mixed, containing fractions of several villages, and each proprietary body being sharers in several mahals.\n\nThere was moreover no record-of-rights, and this was not attempted till 1841, while even then the papers prepared were absolutely useless. The revision of records in that year was accompanied by a slight change in the revenue, as the separate offices of tahsildar and sarishtadar were abolished, the duties being performed by the tahsildar and ganungo of Rasra, so that the old allowances were reduced to Rs. 228, and the net revenue increased by Rs. 1,415, the gross total remaining the same as before. In 1868 an attempt was made to prepare a complete set of records, and the work was finished in 1873. The results were not very satisfactory as numerous errors were found in the papers, owing not only to the unusual intricacy of tenures, the enormous number of shareholders, and the almost indefinite subdivision of shares, but also to the apathy and covert opposition of the samindars themselves. The confusion that had arisen was indeed extraordinary. Up to 1874 the revenue was collected by the lumberdars of the different mahals with the aid of chaprasis from certain recorded persons scattered all over the country without any regard to the extent of their holdings, and irrespective of the fact as to whether they held any land or not. Under this system the transfer of land did not affect the payment of revenue, for the man who sold it still remained liable for the demand, while the purchaser was liable to no enhancement. This confusion\narose from the well-known custom by which a shareholder possessing land in several villages pays his revenue only in one; so that when he purchases land in another village, he does not pay the amount by which the revenue has been increased in the new village, but in his own. When the collection of revenue was made over to the tahsilbar of Rasra in 1841, this custom was not understood, and hence the result that the man who sold land had still to pay its revenue, a result which was solely due to the carelessness and ignorance of the tahsil officials. The record-of-rights enabled the patroori system to be introduced, it reformed the loose customs relating to transactions in land, and it completely roused the zamindars from their old attitude of apathy. The very errors of the record led to its improvement; and at all events prepared the way for the next revision in 1852, which followed on a cadastral survey. An attempt had formerly been made to get the zamindars to agree to a uniform distribution of the revenue on the whole cultivated area, and this endeavour was renewed by Mr. Roberts, though without success, and eventually the demand was distributed by calculating a rate for the culturable area of each mahal and applying it to the several holdings.\n\nThe Sengars still retain their proprietary interest, though a small portion of the land has been alienated. According to the latest returns 83 per cent. of the pargana is held by the Sengars, 11-4 per cent. by Brahmans and 4-5 per cent. by Musalmans, the remainder being held by other Hindus. The Musalmans are confined to a single village, which is said to have been bestowed on their Pathan ancestors in return for military services rendered to some Sengar chieftain; their rights were on several occasions contested by the Sengars, and on at least two of these the Pathans were actually dispossessed. The Brahmans obtained their land originally as muafi grants, but they are included in the pargana revenue-roll, and the three villages which they now hold are recorded as zamindari property.\n\nMAIRITAR, Pargana KHANTO, Tahsil BANSDIR.\n\nA large village on the eastern bank of the Suraha Tal, lying in 25\u00b0 51' N. and 84\u00b0 13' E., on the cross road connecting that from Ballia to Bansdih with that from Bansdih to Maniar, at a\ndistance of two miles south-west from the headquarters of the tahsil and some ten miles from Ballia. To the south of the village is a large mango grove, well known as a camping-ground to those who frequent the Suraha Tal during the cold weather, when the lake abounds with waterfowl. The place is in a thriving condition, and has grown largely of late years. In 1881 it had a population of 2,005, and this rose to 3,006 in 1891, while at the last census Mairitar contained 3,002 inhabitants, of whom all but 14 were Hindus. The principal residents are Narauni Rajputs, who obtained the engagement at the permanent settlement for this village and all the Sukhpura taluqa. They still retain most of their old possessions, though a small portion of this village has been sold to Kayasthas. The total area is 924 acres and the revenue-demand Rs. 862. Mairitar contains nine sugar refineries, an upper primary school, and a bazar in which markets are held twice a week.\n\nMAJHAWA. Pargana and Tahsil BALLIA.\n\nThis village, also known as Machhwa Tal from a swamp to the north of the main site, lies in 25\u00b0 46' N. and 84\u00b0 23' E., on the road from Ballia to Bairia, at a distance of one mile north of the Ganges and thirteen miles east from the district headquarters. A few years ago the place narrowly escaped destruction, for the Ganges made its way northwards to the very edge of the village; but it has since receded and the lands have again reformed. The place, however, lies low, and much of the area is inundated during the rains. This low ground affords abundant pasturage, and considerable numbers of horses are grazed here, being imported from the Meerut division and elsewhere during March or April and sold at the Sonpur fair and other gatherings. The trade has diminished of late years, but is still of some importance. The population of Majhawa in 1881 numbered 2,122 souls, but at the last census it had risen to 2,801, of whom 35 were Musalmans. The principal residents are Rathor and Hayobans Rajputs, who are the owners of the greater portion of the land, and are an extremely litigious community. The place contains a sugar refinery, nine looms, an upper primary school, and a bazar in which markets are held twice a week.\nMANIAR, Pargana KHAJID, Tahsil BANSDH.\n\nA considerable town of some commercial importance, standing on the right bank of the Ghagra, in $25^\\circ 59' N.$ and $84^\\circ 11' E.$, at a distance of seven miles south-east from Sikandarpur, 18 miles from Ballia, and eight miles from the tahsil headquarters, with which it is connected by an unmetalled road, continuing to Sikandarpur and Turtipar. The place has one main road, with masonry drains on either side, but has hardly any of the characteristics of a town, with no public buildings of any note, the houses being clustered round high artificial mounds, which are now waste and bare, but were formerly occupied by the fortified residences of the proprietors. Its importance is derived from its position on the river, which has made Maniar a prominent centre of the grain trade; large quantities of rice and other grains are brought in boats from Gorakhpur, Basti and Saran, while salt, tobacco and other articles are brought from lower Bengal. There are six large godas built of burnt bricks and roofed with tiles, and about ten smaller ones, for the storage of grain and other articles, from which the greater part of the pargana is supplied. The chief exports are sugar and oilseeds, which are carried to Patna, Dacca, Murshidabad, Maldah and Calcutta. The manufactures of the town consist of sugar, for which there are eight refineries, and of country cloth, some 25 looms being at work at the present time. The chief market days are Wednesday and Saturday in each week, while a large fair, known as the Ektijin, takes place in the month of Baishakh, the ostensible object being the worship of Parashram, whose temple stands in the town.\n\nAt the census of 1853 Maniar had a population of 6,222 souls, but this fell to 6,124 in 1865 and to 5,285 in 1872. Since that time the place has grown steadily in size, the total being 8,000 in 1881 and 8,765 ten years later. At the last census in 1901 the town contained 9,433 inhabitants, of whom 652 were Muslims. The principal residents are Barwar Rajputs and Banias. There is a police outpost here, as well as a cattle-pound, a branch post-office, an upper primary school, and three unaided indigenous schools with some 40 pupils.\nManiar has been administered under Act XX of 1856 since 1873. The income is derived from a house-tax, which for the three years ending in 1908 averaged Rs. 1,582, while the total receipts from all sources, including the opening balance, were Rs. 2,420. There are 1,781 houses in the town, of which 480 are assessed, the average incidence of the tax being Rs. 2-12-8 per assessed house and Rs. 0-2-8 per head of population. The number of the houses paying the tax has recently been reduced, many of those with a low rate of assessment having been struck off the list. The average expenditure for the same period was Rs. 1,990 annually, the chief heads being Rs. 750 for the maintenance of the town police force, Rs. 286 for the conservancy staff, and Rs. 323 for small local improvements. The provisions of the Sanitation Act are also in force.\n\nThe village lands of Maniar cover 941 acres and are assessed at Rs. 1,926. The permanent settlement was made with the Barwars, whose descendants hold almost the whole area, about one-ninth having been sold to Kayasthas. Maniar gives its name to a tappa, the history of which is of some interest. The Barwars are said to have come from Azamgarh and under the leadership of one Bhimal Rai to have expelled the Paude zamindars from Mander or Maniar, one of the five tappas of Kharid. The descendants of Bhimal Rai divided the estate into three taluqas, still known as Dola Rai, Pahar Rai, and Sahib Rai from the names of the three chieftains of the clan. The entire tappa was settled in 1790 with the Barwars at a final demand of Rs. 14,151. In 1814 considerable arrears had accumulated owing to quarrels that had arisen between the sharers, and the tappa was sold by auction. On the day of the sale the owners tendered the balance due, Rs. 17,832, but having forgotten or being unaware of the claim for interest, they asked for a day's grace, which was most foolishly and inconsiderately refused. The estate was sold for Rs. 50,000 to Thakur Debi Dayal Singh, who was apparently the agent of Shoo Narayan Singh, the father of the well-known Raja Sir Dee Narayan Singh of Bunares. The folly of this sale is further illustrated by the fact that an offer of Rs. 99,000 by one of the co-sharers was refused. The not unnatural result\nwas that the purchaser could not obtain possession and violence ended in several murders. In 1821 the Barwars, after much litigation, threw themselves on the mercy of Government, and eventually the estate was bought back for Rs. 2,06,987, on the 22nd of July 1822. After deducting the arrears of Rs. 17,951, including the interest, and Rs. 4,695 due to the defaulters on account of miscellaneous charges from the Rs. 50,000 paid by Delhi Dayal, there remained to the credit of the Barwars Rs. 36,744, leaving a debit balance of Rs. 1,70,243 to be paid to Government. It was ordered that the estate should pay interest on this sum at the rate of 5 per cent., pending liquidation of the debt, and that this should be added to the original revenue.\n\nThe property was afterwards split up into 18 pattis, the revenue and debt being apportioned to each according to its area; so that any single pattidar could clear off his share of the debt separately. On these conditions the estate, which had hitherto been under direct management, was restored to the Barwars in 1835. Shortly afterwards three pattis fell into arrears: one, Patti Zalim Singh, was put up to auction in 1838, but finding no purchaser, was bought in by Government for Re. 1 and held directly till 1868, when it was resettled with the zamindars at a slightly reduced demand; another, Patti Sanuman Singh, was sold in 1839 for Rs. 1,200, to Qazi Paighambar Bakhsh of Qasipur in pargana Sikandarpur; and the third, Patti Jaipal Rai, was sold in 1843 to Rai Manik Chand, a former deputy collector. In 1882 the widow of Paighambar Bakhsh petitioned Government for a remission of the additional demand in the way of interest and also of the principal, as the latter had been repaid more than twice by the former. She was supported by several other sharers, with the result that on the 13th of August 1887, the remission was granted as an act of grace to the whole tappa, which was thus restored to the revenue as assessed at the permanent settlement. During this period interest amounting to Rs. 4,12,637 had been paid on a debt of Rs. 1,61,350, the difference between this and the initial principal being due to the fact that one patti, that of Jeonath Singh in taluka Palan Rai, had attained the unique distinction of paying off its share of the debt in 1833.\nMURLI CHHAPRA, Pargana DOABA, Tahsil BALLIA.\n\nThis is one of the numerous large villages in pargana Doaba, and is only remarkable for the number of its inhabitants, as is the case with many others in this part of the district, where it frequently happens that the population of a particular site receives large additions through the migration of those whose lands and homesteads have been swept away by the vagaries of the Ganges. It lies in $25^\\circ 43' N.$ and $84^\\circ 31' E.$, at a distance of twenty miles east from Ballia, and four miles south-east from Bafria, whence a road leads through the village to the ferry over the river, giving access to Rihia in Shahabad. At the present time the Ganges is some four miles distant, but at the survey it flowed within a mile of the main site. The population of Murli Chhapra includes that of Dukti, a hamlet founded by the inhabitants of the village of that name which was submerged many years ago. The total in 1881 was 3,549, rising to 3,670 ten years later, while in 1901 it was 3,587, of whom 127 were Musalmans. The principal residents are Tomar Rajputs, but the lands, which cover 323 acres and are assessed a Rs. 635, are owned by the Dumraon estate, which has been in possession since 1839, when the former revenue-free grant was resumed. Markets are held twice a week in Murli Chhapra, and in the hamlet of Dalan Chhapra; there is a post-office and an upper primary school.\n\nNAGPURA, Pargana LAKHNESAR, Tahsil RAURA.\n\nThis village lies in the south-east corner of the pargana, in $25^\\circ 46' N.$ and $83^\\circ 55' E.$, at a distance of some 15 miles from Ballia and about six miles south-east from the tahsil headquarters. It is built on the left bank of the Sarju, and almost adjoins Tika Deori, another large village which forms the subject of a separate article. Like that place, it is held by Sengar Rajputs, who have been settled here for several centuries. In the village is a temple in honour of Nath Baba, the patron saint of the clan, of whom some mention has been made in Chapter III. The village contains seven sugar factories and eight looms, while markets are held weekly in the bazar on Sundays. The Sarju is crossed during the rains by a ferry, which is the property of the zamindars.\nThe population of Nagpura at the last census numbered 2,577 souls, of whom 331 were Musalmans, chiefly of the Julaha caste. There has been a considerable decline of late years, for in 1891 the total was 2,717, while at the preceding enumeration of 1881 the place contained no fewer than 3,620 inhabitants.\n\nNAGRA, Pargana SIKANDARPUR WEST, Tahsil RASRA.\n\nA large and important village lying in 25\u00b0 57' N. and 83\u00b0 53' E., at the junction of several unmetalled roads leading to Rasra on the south, Garwar on the south-east, Sikandarpur on the north-east, Turtipar on the north, Bhimpura and Ghosi on the north-west, Haldharpur and Mau on the west, and Ghazipur on the south-west. It is eight miles distant from Rasra and 24 miles from the headquarters of the district. The village belongs to tappa Muhammadpur, and on the formation of the Azamgarh district in 1832 it was made the headquarters of a tahsil; it so remained till the constitution of Ballia as a separate district and the transfer of Bhadaon and Sikandarpur in 1879. This change materially affected the prosperity of Nagra, but the place still possesses a police-station, a post-office, a cattle-pound, an upper primary school, and a small unaided school, as well as a sugar factory and six looms. There is but little trade, and the markets held twice a week in the bazar merely serve to supply the needs of the neighbouring villages. The population, which numbered 3,360 in 1881, had risen to 3,668 at the next census, but by 1901 had declined to 3,207, of whom 644 were Musalmans. The principal inhabitants are Bais Rajputs, this being the chief home of the clan in this district. The colony is said to have been founded by Bhim Sen, of Kuba Newada in Azamgarh, who settled at Nagra about the year 1623. He and his son, Gujan Sah, as also his grandson, Aman or Ban Sah, extended the family estates beyond the borders of the tappa; and finally, in the fourth generation, Bishun Singh and Kishan Singh won the favour of the Nawab Wazir and reduced the entire pargana to subjection. At the permanent settlement the Bais were deprived of most of their ill-gotten gains, but they still hold a fine estate. The present proprietors are Bans Bahadur Singh and Jang Bahadur Singh, whose property is now under\nthe Court of Wards. Nagra itself has an area of 1883 acres, and is assessed at Rs. 1,475.\n\nNAGWA, Pargana and Tehsil Ballia.\n\nA large and flourishing village standing in 25\u00b0 44' N. and 84\u00b0 13' E., on the north side of the road leading from Ballia to Bairia, at a distance of three miles east from the district headquarters. It contains an upper primary school, a bazar in which markets are held three times a week, a sugar refinery, and several looms. The population has risen steadily from 3,234 in 1891 to 3,342 in 1891, and to 3,476 at the last census; there were then 139 Musalmans in the place, while the principal inhabitants are Pande Brahmans, who hold most of the land at privileged rates. Their ancestors engaged for the village at the permanent settlement, but the proprietary right subsequently passed into the hands of the Maharaja of Dumraon. From the west of the village a recently-constructed branch road runs north-west to the new civil station of Ballia.\n\nNARAINPUR, Pargana Garha, Tehsil Ballia.\n\nThis is the largest of four villages which were transferred from pargana Muhammadabad in Ghazipur to pargana Garha of this district in 1892. It lies in 25\u00b0 34' N. and 83\u00b0 52' E., a short distance to the north of the main road from Ballia to Ghazipur, some two miles west from Korantadib, and about a mile north of the Ganges. The village was once included in the old stud farm, but at the present time its only claim to mention is the size of its population, which at the last census numbered 4,204 persons, including 187 Musalmans and a large community of Bhumihars, the latter being the owners of the village lands. The area is very small, comprising little more than the main site, and the revenue is but Rs. 80; all the cultivation lies in the adjoining villages of Gobindpur, Bishambarpah, and Sarai Kota. A short distance to the east is a branch road leading northwards to Lathulih in the Ghazipur district. Narainpur is a place of some antiquity, and contains traces of ancient habitations, in the neighbourhood of which old coins are sometimes found. It was identified by Dr. Oldham as the site of the temple of Narayana Deva, mentioned by the Chinese pilgrims as being opposite to Buxar.\nNARHI, Pargana GARRA, Tahsil BALLIA.\n\nA very large village in the north of the pargana, standing in 25\u00b0 42' N. and 84\u00b0 2' E., on the left bank of the Mangai, some three miles from its confluence with the Sarju, and on the east side of the metalled road from Ballia to Ghasipur, at a distance of some eight miles south-west from the former, though by road it amounts to more than eleven miles. A second road runs west from the village to Karon and Tajpur on the railway. Narhi gives its name to a taluqa held by Bhumiharas of the Benwar clan, whose contests in the law courts with the Dumraon estate have been notorious for the past sixty years. The dispute arose between the Benwar Chauhans of Narhi, the chief of the sixteen villages, and the Maharaja with regard to certain alluvial lands on the boundary, and began in 1855. This was not brought to a conclusion, however, till 1876, when the decree obtained by the Maharaja, together with means profits, amounted to more than ten lakhs of rupees, and this rose to about sixteen lakhs with the addition of interest. Finally the whole taluqa was put up to auction and purchased by the Maharani for six lakhs. The Nachi Balus, who with some reason regarded themselves as unjustly treated, successfully resisted all attempts on the part of Dumraon to collect rents. More litigation ensued, with the result that the co-sharers of about five annas were exempted from the earlier decree and recovered their proprietary rights. As the taluqa was undivided, this only increased the difficulties of Dumraon; disputes and fights were of frequently occurrence, and Government had to intervene to stop what was in fact a public scandal. Finally in 1907 an agreement was reached, whereby the Maharani consented to sell her rights in the taluqa on the Ballia side of the river for Rs. 117,000, a sum based on the capitalised value of the difference between the revenue of 1795 and that which would be obtained by a settlement at 50 per cent. of the present assets of the eleven-anna shares. Rents were fixed for the djara lands, and Government undertook to resettle the taluqa with the persons who would have owned the shares if they had never passed to Dumraon.\n\nThe population of Narhi numbered 5,415 souls in 1881, and this rose to 6,929 at the following census. In 1901, however,\na marked decline was observed, the total being 6,462, of whom 201 were Musalmans, while over one-third were Bhumihars. The place contains an upper primary school, a police outpost, and a bazar in which markets are held twice a week. The total area of the village lands is 1,822 acres, and the revenue Rs. 1,385.\n\nPAKRI, Pargana Sikandarpur East, Tahsil Bansdih.\n\nThis village lies in the south-east corner of the pargana, adjoining the boundary of Kopachit, in $25^\\circ 56' N.$ and $84^\\circ 0' E.$, at a distance of fourteen miles from Ballia and some fifteen miles from Bansdih. Like Pur, which lies to the north, Pakri belongs to the Shah Salempur tappa and was included in Kopachit till its transfer to Arangarh in 1833. It was permanently settled with Sengar Rajputs, and remained in their hands till 1850, when about one-sixth was sold to Ram Narayan Singh of Birpura. In 1858 a larger portion was confiscated on account of rebellion, and the proprietary right was bestowed upon Sheikh Inayat Rasul of Chiriakot, as a reward for good services during the mutiny. At the present time the Sengars hold about 10\u00bd annas, and the Sheikhs nearly 4\u00bd annas, while the rest is owned by Brahmans, Kayasthas, Kalwars, and Kandu Banias; the total area is 2,779 acres, and the revenue Rs. 2,157. The population of Pakri in 1881 numbered 2,853 souls, and since that time has considerably increased. The total in 1891 was 3,517, though at the last census it had dropped to 3,224, of whom 203 were Musalmans; the Sengars constitute more than one-third of the whole number. The place contains at the present time seven sugar refineries and some thirty looms, but there is neither school nor market. Adjoining the village is a large jhil, which stretches northwards for the distance of nearly a mile.\n\nPHARSATAR, Pargana Sikandarpur West, Tahsil Rasra.\n\nThis village lies in $26^\\circ 5' N.$ and $83^\\circ 52' E.$, on the west side of the road leading from Nagra to Ubhaon, at a distance of 16 miles from Rasra and some 30 miles from the district headquarters. It gives its name to a tappa, which was granted in the reign of Aurangzeb to one Raha-ul-din, an Ansari Sheikh, who commanded an expedition sent against the Bison Raja of Majhuli.\nin Gorakhpur. He settled at Pharsatar, and his descendants came into contact with the Bais Rajputs of Nagra at the beginning of the 18th century. Tradition relates that all the Sheikhs lost their lives in the struggle, with the solitary exception of a woman named Rahm Bibi. The Sheikhs subsequently recovered the property, mainly through the exertions of Khadim Ali, a great-uncle of the present owner, and obtained the recognition of their rights at the permanent settlement; the tappa is now held by a large community, of whom the leading representative is Sheikh Abdul Aham. Pharsatar has an area of 1,181 acres and is assessed at Rs. 637. The population has somewhat declined of late years, the total in 1881 being 2,302, and at the following census 2,270. In 1901 the place contained 2,091 inhabitants, of whom 598 were Musalmans. The village possesses a branch post-office, a lower primary school, and a bazaar in which markets are held twice a week.\n\n**PHEPHNA, Pargana KORACHIT EAST, Tahsil BALLIA.**\n\nThis village lies in 25\u00b0 46' N. and 84\u00b0 3' E., at a distance of some seven miles west from Ballia and fourteen miles from Raora. It is of considerable importance as a road and railway junction. Close to the village on the south runs the Bengal and North-Western line from Benares to Ballia, and to the west of the station a branch line takes off to Mau. Parallel to the former runs the metalled road from Ballia to Ghasipur and Benares, while a similar branch road leads west to Rasra. An unmetalled road goes north from the junction to Garwar and Sikandarpur. Apart from its position Phephna is of no importance. The village is held by Kanak Rajputs, who pay Rs. 612 on an area of 379 acres. The population at the last census numbered 1,370 souls, chiefly Kanaks, Brahmins, Koeris and Ahirs. There is a police outpost here, as well as a branch post-office and a lower primary school.\n\n**PUR, Pargana SIKANDARPUR EAST, Tahsil BANSDHIT.**\n\nAn immense straggling village in the south-east of the pargana stretching from Khajuri on the east to the boundary of Sikandarpur on the west. It lies in 25\u00b0 57' N. and 84\u00b0 1' E., at a\ndistance of eighteen miles north-west from Ballia and fourteen miles from the tahsil headquarters. In addition to the main site, there is a number of hamlets scattered over the village lands, and a total population at the last census was 6,859 persons, of whom 461 were Musalmans. The principal inhabitants are Sengar Rajputs, who were acknowledged as the proprietors at the permanent settlement and still retain about one-half of the area. Pur forms a portion of tappa Shah Salampur, which was originally included in Kopachit, but was transferred with other villages to the Azamgarh district in 1838. Save for its size the place is of little importance; it possesses a lower primary school and two bazars; one being situated in the main site, and the other in a hamlet called Tola Galarn. There are at present nine sugar refineries in the village and some twenty looms.\n\nRASRA, Pargana LAKHESAR, Tahsil RASRA.\n\nThe headquarters of the western tahsil are located in a thriving and considerable town, which is the most important commercial centre in the district. It stands in $25^\\circ 51' N.$ and $83^\\circ 52' E.$, at a distance of 21 miles west-north-west from Ballia. It is connected with the capital of the district both by the railway and a metalled road; the former passes to the north of the town, the station being about half a mile distant, while the latter runs parallel to and to the south of the railway, and joins the Ghazipur road at Phaphna. An unmetalled continuation of this road leads north-west along the railway to Haldibarpar and Mau in Assamgarh, while another road goes north from the railway station to Nagra, and four more lead southwards to different points on the Ghazipur border. The chief of these is that running to Pardhanpur on the Sarju, a distance of four miles, whence the trade of Rasra used to be carried by river to the Ganges. The water-borne traffic has not disappeared, though it has been largely supplanted by road and railway. The chief articles of commerce are cloth, sugar, hides, iron, spices and crude saltpetre; the business being in the hands of Banias and Musalman Iraqis. The town has greatly benefited by the advent of the railway, for in former days communications were difficult during the rains, owing to the low level of the surrounding country, which consists mainly of rice fields.\nThe town is for the most part substantially built and has a prosperous appearance; the streets are well laid out and more cleanly than is the case with most places in this district, though a proper drainage system is needed. The population of Rasra at the census of 1853 was 7,228, but this fell to 5,625 in 1865, while in 1881 it has risen to 11,224. Since that time there has been a considerable decrease, for in 1891 the total was 9,752, while at the last census the place contained 9,872 inhabitants, of whom 6,366 were Hindus, 3,392 Musalmans, and 114 of other religions, chiefly Sikhs. The number of Musalmans is particularly large for this district, and their position is illustrated by the presence of nine masonry mosques in the town and nine smaller buildings of a similar nature. The principal Hindu inhabitants are Sengar Rajputs and Kamlu and other Banias. The place has been the headquarters of the Sengars for a long period; they own almost all the Lakhnesar pargana, and the lands of Rasra, which cover 1,100 acres and are assessed at Rs. 794, are mainly in their possession, though a portion has been acquired by Barnawal Banias. The Sengars realize large sums from ground-rents in the town, and in old days used to exact considerable market and other dues. The latter were abolished by Government in 1788, and the Sengars were prepared to resist the order by force, till a compromise was suggested by the merchants, who had everything to lose by a conflict, whereby the ground-rents were raised by one-half. Adjoining the town on the west is an extensive grove, the remains, it is said, of a primeval forest, containing a large tank and the shrine of Nath Baba, the patron saint of the Sengars. Round the tank are several temples, and hundreds of small sati monuments, of cylindrical shape and ovoid tops, whitewashed and dotted with red patches: some are merely of earth, while others are substantially built of brick or stone. The practice appears to have been unusually prevalent in this neighbourhood, and actually as late as May 1871 a woman became sati at Rasra. She was not a Sengar widow, however, but of the Bania caste, and contrived with the aid of her step-sons and the family priest, who were afterwards brought to justice, to be burnt to death on an extemporised pyre of cane and straw in front of her own house.\nThe public buildings of Rasra include the tahsil, the munsif's court and the police-station, which are located in a single block, resembling a fort in appearance, with towers at the angles, standing on the north side of the town, close to the Ballia road. To the right and left of this block are the middle school and the dispensary respectively; while other institutions comprise the post-office, cattle-pound, an aided primary school, and an unaided indigenous school. The market days are Wednesday and Saturday in each week; a considerable fair takes place here in the month of Kuar on the occasion of the Ramlila festival.\n\nRasra is administered under the provisions of the Sanitation Act and also of Act XX of 1856, the latter having been in force since 1860. In 1906 there were 2,572 houses in the town, and of these 420 were assessed to taxation, the number being formerly much greater, owing to the inclusion of many houses with a very small assessment, which were exempted in this year in conformity with a general change of policy adopted throughout the district. The average income for the three preceding years from the house-tax alone was Rs. 2,254, giving an incidence of Rs. 3-11-10 per assessed house, and Re. 0-3-9 per head of population; while the total receipts from all sources, including the initial balance, was Rs. 3,827. The average expenditure for the same period was Rs. 3,405, the chief items being Rs. 1,224 for the upkeep of the town police force, Rs. 402 for the maintenance of the conservancy staff, and Rs. 1,184 for minor public improvements. It is now proposed to raise the town to the status of a notified area under Act I of 1900.\n\nRASRA Tahsil.\n\nThis tahsil forms the western subdivision of the district, and consists of a compact block of country, bounded on the south by Ghazipur, on the west by Azamgarh, on the north by the Ghagra, which separates it from the Gorakhpur district, and on the east by the Banadih and Ballia tahsils. It is made up of four parganas, Lakhnesar, Kopachit West, Sikandarpur West and Bhadon, each of which forms the subject of a separate article. An account of the constitution of the tahsil has been given in Chapter IV, in dealing with the history of the formation\nof the Ballia district. The total area, as calculated from the average for the five years ending in 1908, was 270,167 acres or 422 square miles. The variation is but small, and is confined to the banks of the Ghagra in the north; and even here it is less than was formerly the case as the course of the river has been to some extent fixed by the Turtipar bridge and the training works on either side. The cultivated area in the same years averaged 173,745 acres or 64-2 per cent. of the whole.\n\nIn its physical aspects the tahsil is fairly homogeneous, for it belongs almost in its entirety to the upland tract, the only exception to this rule being afforded by a small area in the north of pargana Sikandarpur West. Here there is a narrow strip of low alluvium along the Ghagra, both to the west of Turtipar, and also to the east, between that place and Qutbganj, where the next kanker reef occurs. The drainage of the upland is carried off to a very limited extent by the Ghagra and its tributary the Ahar, which for a few miles forms the western boundary; and the bulk of the surface drainage finds its way to the Sarju on the south and its various affluents, of which the most important is the Budhi. The latter is a sluggish stream originating in the Ramahi chain of hills, and in many other places the natural fall of the water is ill-defined, resulting in the formation of several large lakes. The soil is either loam or clay, while in pargana Bhadaon and elsewhere in the southern half of the tahsil there are large expanses of unfertile land. Rice is the principal kharif crop, and then come sugarcane and cotton, while in the rabi peas and barley together occupy over two-thirds of the area tilled.\n\nThe tahsil is administered as a subdivision in the charge of a full-powered officer on the district staff. There is also a tahsildar with headquarters at Rasra, and at the present time Baha Ram Parkash Singh is an honorary magistrate for the Nagra police circle; while the civil jurisdiction is included in that of the Rasra munsif, who is subordinate to the judge of Ghazipur. For the purposes of police administration there are stations at Rasra, Nagra, Habllharpur and Uthson, but these circles do not comprise the whole tahsil, as the greater part of Kopachit West is included in that of the Garwar station in tahsil Ballia.\nPrior to the constitution of the Ballia district the parganas of Sikandarpur West and Bhadaon were included in Azamgarh, while the remainder belonged to Ghazipur. At the census of 1881 the total population was 292,038, and this rose to 307,045 at the following census. The last enumeration of 1901 showed a marked decline, the number of inhabitants dropping to 288,296, of whom 145,212 were females. Classified according to religion, there were 264,005 Hindus, 24,036 Musalmans, 116 Sikhs, six Aryas, two Christians and one Jain. The predominant Hindu castes are Chamaras, of whom there were 42,126; Rajputs, 38,737; Ahirs, 34,730; Brahmans, 25,713; Bihars, 19,003; Koeris, 15,066; and Banias, 12,000. The Rajputs belong to many different clans, but the chief are the Sengars, who own all Lakhnoor, the Bais, with their headquarters at Nagra, Bisna, Chauhans, and Bachgotis. Among the Musalmans, Julahas take the lead with 8,515 representatives, the bulk of the remainder being Shihhas, Bohras, and Pathans. The tahsil is mainly agricultural, although Raurn is the chief business centre in the district. According to the census statistics nearly 72 per cent. of the people were directly dependent on cultivation, while the chief industries are cotton-weaving and the manufacture of sugar and saltpetre. Itaara is the only town, but there are many large villages, such as Nagpura, Jam and Tika Door in pargana Lakhnoor; Hajiali and Duni in Kopschit; and Turtipar, Nagra, Turi Baragaon and Phareswar in Sikandarpur West. The markets, fairs, schools, post-offices and ferries of the tahsil will be found in the appendix.\n\nThe tahsil is fairly well supplied with means of communication. Through the south runs the branch line of the Bengal and North-Western Railway from Mau to Ballia, with stations at Ratanpura, Rasru, and Chilkahar; while along the western borders passes that from Mau to Turtipar and Gorakhpur, the stations being at Kidhlapur, Bithra Road (Siar) and Turtipar, where the railway crosses the river Ghagra by a magnificent bridge. The only installed road is that connecting Rasru with the district headquarters, but the tahsil is covered with a network of unmetalled roads, most of which are kept in good order. Several of these radiate from Nagra, which in old days was the capital of a tahsil in the Azamgarh district; they lead to Rasru, Garwar,\nSikandarpur, Ubhaon, Ghosi and Mau in Amangarh, and to Ghazipur. The position of the remaining roads will be seen in the map.\n\nRATANPURA, Pargana Sikandarpur West, Tahsil Rasra.\nThis small village merely deserves mention as possessing a railway station, between Rasra and Haldibarpar on the line from Mau to Rovelganj. It stands close to the western border of the pargana, in $25^\\circ 55'$ N. and $83^\\circ 45'$ E., at a distance of eight miles north-west from Rasra, with which it is also connected by an unmetalled road running through the village to Haldibarpar. The station is to the east of the main site, close to the main road from Rasra. Ratanpura had at the last census a population of 861 persons, chiefly Brahmans and Rajputs, the former being the proprietors of the village, which has an area of 396 acres. The place contains a upper primary school, and a small bazar in which markets are held twice a week.\n\nRATSAND, Pargana Koraonit East, Tahsil Ballia.\nA large village in the north of the pargana lying on the east side of the road from Garwar to Khajuri, In $25^\\circ 54'$ N. and $84^\\circ 3'$ E., at a distance of some twelve miles north-west from the district headquarters. It is the principal village of the Ratsand taluka, which was permanently settled with Kacholi Rajputs, and is still held by members of the same clan, who pay a revenue of Rs. 875 on an area of 1,318 acres. The population in 1881 numbered 4,011 souls, and this rose to 5,813 at the following census. In 1901, however, a slight decline was observed, the total being 5,555, of whom 1,918 were Musalmans. The village possesses a large upper primary school, two small indigenous schools, a branch post-office, a cattle-pound, and a somewhat important market. There are six looms in the place at the present time, and three sugar refineries.\n\nREOTTI, Pargana Khabid, Tahsil Bansdih.\nA town in the extreme east of the pargana, in $25^\\circ 51'$ N. and $84^\\circ 24'$ E., at a distance of some ten miles from Bansdih and 16 miles from Ballia. The main site stands on the eastern\nbank of a large lake known as the Rooti Dah, and is approached by two unmetalled roads, one leading south-east to Bairia, and the other west to Sahatwur. A third road goes south to the Rooti station on the railway, about half a mile distant, and thence continues to Majhawa. The place has a dirty and overcrowded appearance, and suffers from its low situation, all the country round being swampy and liable to inundation. The population has fluctuated considerably during the past fifty years. In 1853 it was returned as 3,955, but by 1866 it had dropped to 6,079. In 1872 the total rose to 7,700, and again in 1881 it was 9,933. From this it fell to 8,526 in 1891, while at the last census the town contained 8,631 inhabitants, of whom 925 were Musalmans. The latter are mainly Julahas, who turn out large quantities of coarse cloth, much of which is exported to Bengal; at present about 76 looms are at work. Other manufactures are shoes, which are made by Chamaras, and palanquins, numbers of which are sent for sale to the Daulri fair at Ballia. Apart from this, the trade is purely local and of little importance. Markets are held twice a week in the bazaar, and a small fair takes place on the occasion of the Dashahra festival.\n\nRooti possesses a second-class police-station, a postal sub-office, a cattle-pound, an upper primary school, and three unaided indigenous schools. The village lands cover 1,013 acres and pay a revenue of Rs. 1,265. The town is the headquarters of a tappa and is the principal seat of the Nikumbh Rajputs of this pargana. They have, however, lost much of their property and influence, and the greater part of Rooti is now in the hands of Brahmins and others: some of the proprietors are non-resident, but others have acquired a considerable position in the place.\n\nRooti has been administered since 1873 under Act XX of 1856. There were 1,043 houses in 1906, of which 421 were assessed. The income from the house-tax for the three preceding years averaged Rs. 1,010, giving an incidence of Rs. 2-4-1 per assessed house and Rs. 0-1-11 per head of population; while the total receipts, including the opening balance, were Rs. 1,326. The expenditure for the same period averaged Rs. 1,259 the chief items being Rs. 643 for the upkeep of the town police force, Rs. 180 for the maintenance of the conservancy staff, and Rs. 174\nfor local public improvements. Since 1905 an alteration has been made in the system of assessment, the poorer houses which were formerly taxed having been exempted. As in the other Act XX towns of the district, the Sanitation Act is in force.\n\nSAHATWAR, Pargana Kharid, Tehsil Bansdih.\n\nSahatwar, also called Mahawar and Mahatpal, is the largest town in the pargana. It lies in $25^\\circ 50' N.$ and $84^\\circ 10' E.$, at a distance of six miles south-east from Bansdih and twelve miles from the district headquarters. Through it runs the road from Pallia to Rooti, joined on the east of the town by that from Bansdih, while a third leads south to the railway station, about half a mile distant, and thence to Haldi in pargana Ballia. The first road passes through the centre of the town, which is roughly quadrangular in shape, and on either side is the bazar. The houses are for the most part substantially built, giving the place a prosperous appearance; but the neighbouring country is swampy, so that the roads are almost impassable in the rains, and the unhealthiness of the climate has of late years caused extensive emigration, which has been accentuated by several epidemics of cholera. The population in 1853 numbered 9,353 souls, and though this dropped to 8,301 in 1865, the total had risen by 1872 to 8,975, while in 1881 it was 11,024, and ten years later 11,519. In 1901 the number of inhabitants had declined to 10,784, of whom 758 were Musalmans. The latter are mainly Jala'as, who carry on their ancestral occupation of weaving, some fifty looms being in existence. There are two indigo factories belonging to natives of the place, and large numbers of palanquins are made here for sale at the Dadri fair and elsewhere. The trade is considerable, as the town is favourably situated on road and railway, and serves as a collecting and distributing centre for the surrounding country. The chief exports are sugar, cloth, shoes and indigo; while the imports are cotton and salt from the west, and tobacco and piecegoods from Bengal. Markets are held twice a week in the bazar, and during the autumn months there is a large trade in cattle. A fair of little commercial importance takes place at the Dasahra in Kuar.\nThe town contains a police out-post, a post-office, a cattle-pound, and a middle vernacular school. The principal inhabitants are Kinwar Rajputs, Banias and Brahmans. The first owns most of the tappa of Sahatwar, and still retain most of the village lands, which cover 1,273 acres, assessed at Rs. 2,518, though small portions have been sold to Kayasthas and Bhumars. The place is said to have been founded by one Mahant Rileswar Nath, though the connection of this personage with the name in any of its variant forms is not self-evident.\n\nSahatwar is administered under the provisions of the Sanitation Act and Act XX of 1856, the latter having been put in force in 1873. The income is derived, as usual, from the house-tax, which in 1890 was levied on 441 out of a total of 1,837 houses. The average income from this source for the three preceding years was Rs. 1,680, which gave an incidence of Rs. 0.2-3 per head of population and Rs. 2-10-4 per assessed house. During the same period the total income from all sources averaged Rs. 2,017, including the opening balance, and the expenditure Rs. 2,216; the chief heads being Rs. 942 for the maintenance of the police force, Rs. 287 for conservancy, and Rs. 817 annually for local public improvements.\n\nSERIYA, Paegana and Tehsil Ballia.\n\nA village lying in 25\u00b0 47' N. and 84\u00b0 15' E., some three miles east of the road from Ballia to Baradilh, and seven miles north-east from the district headquarters. It is the principal village of the Seriaya, and is frequently known as Seriaya to distinguish it from another Seriaya near the Suraha Tal and to the west of the Baradilh road. The entire estate, which was settled in 1790 with Kinwar Rajputs, was purchased by Sheikh Farzand Ali of Ghasipur, and subsequently passed into the hands of Sadho Lal and Madho Lal, Nagar Brahmans and bankers of Benares. The former died, and the whole is now held by the Hon'ble Munshi Madho Lal, who has a residence here. The area of the village is 1,624 acres and the revenue Rs. 2,206. It is a flourishing place with two sugar factories, a bazaar in which markets are held on Sundays and Wednesdays, a lower primary school, and a small unaided indigenous school. The population\nat the last census numbered 2,448 souls, including 156 Musalmans, the prevailing Hindu castes being Kinwars and Brahmans.\n\nSHEOPURDIAR, Pargana and Tahsil\n\nBALLIA.\n\nAs its name implies, this village lies in the alluvial belt on the banks of the Ganges, being situated in $25^\\circ 42' N.$ and $84^\\circ 13' E.$, at a distance of some four miles south-east from Ballia, with which it is connected by an indifferent road leading on to Jashbi. The place consists of twenty-seven scattered hamlets which are dotted about the village lands. The area, which is liable to constant change, amounted in 1905 to 3,176 acres. For some years a large portion of the village lay on the south side of the river, being at first an island or chakki, and this was included in Shahabad in respect of criminal and civil jurisdiction, though the revenue of the whole village continued to be paid in Ballia till the constitution of the chakki as a separate mahal. Sheopurdiar forms a taluq of pargana Ballia, and is held by Ponwar or Ujjain Rajputs, the different hamlets being named after their various Rajput founders. The tradition is that about two hundred years ago one of the Durnraon family named Dhari Sah, of Bharia in pargana Bhojpur of the Shahabad district, migrated to the north of the Ganges and obtained a grant of land from the Raja of Haldi. His descendants retained the property intact till the mutiny, when one share, belonging to Siddha Singh and amounting to one-sixteenth of the whole, was confiscated for the rebellion of its owner and purchased by the Durnraon estate. The rest is in the hands of Dhari Sah's family, who are for the most part in reduced circumstances owing to erosion by the Ganges and to protracted litigation with Durnraon on account of the chakki in Shahabad. Under an agreement made in 1825 the permanent revenue of the lambari mahal of 3,901 acres amounts to Rs. 10,001, and the remaining lands, after a deduction of 554 acres, are assessed quinquennially at a fixed rate of Rs. 2-10-1 per acre of cultivated and culturable land. In 1885 the revenue was Rs. 28,750, and at the last quinquennial revision in 1902 it was Rs. 20,347 of which Rs. 1,101 were payable at the Shahabad treasury.\nThe population of the village fluctuates with its area. In 1881 it was 9,923, but this fell to 9,332 in 1891, while at the following census it was 9,409, including 9,130 Hindus, chiefly Rajputs, Bhumars and Brahmins, and 279 Musalmans. The last are Julahas, who do a large trade in country cloth, some 50 looms being at work. There is one factory for refining sugar, an upper primary school in the hamlet of Bhao Singh, and a bazar in which markets are held twice a week.\n\nSIKANDARPUR, Pargana Sikandarpur East, Tahsil Bansdih.\n\nThe old town of Sikandarpur stands in the north-east corner of the pargana, in 26\u00b0 3' N. and 84\u00b0 4' E., at a distance of three miles south from the right bank of the Ghagra, fourteen miles from Bansdih, and 21 miles from the district headquarters. Through the north portion passes the road from Bansdih to Turtipar, and this is joined by two other roads; that on the east leading from Ballia and Garwar, and that on the west from Nagra. There is no revenue mauza of Sikandarpur, the site occupying the whole or part of several distinct mahals. There are seven different mohallas or quarters, known as Qasba Khan, Domanpura, Chak Mubarak, Bhikhpura, Bodha Musfi, Rohilnapali Kharwans, and Rohilnapali Kharkasi.\n\nThe place is of undoubted antiquity and was once of great importance, as is attested by the existence of ruins which extend as far as Khavid, four miles to the east. These perhaps represent the remains of the old Musalman town of Ghazanfarabad, of which nothing is known beyond local tradition of the vaguest nature. To the east of the Ballia road may be traced the remains of a large fort, still known as the Qila Kohna: all that is left consists of scattered bricks and fragments of the walls and gates. The name of Sikandarpur is said to be derived from Sikandar Lodi, who re-established the rule of the Delhi Sultans in these parts, after the overthrow of the Jaunpur kingdom. He was a fierce persecutor of the Hindus, and this fact may account for the tradition that when the fort was being built by the Sultan's officer, the walls fell down; thereupon a local saint gave the amusing advice that two Hindu girls should be immured, and this was carried out, a\nBrahman virgin being shut up near the western, and a Daudhain near the eastern gate. The spot where the former met her fate is marked by a temple still standing; but the place where her humble sister suffered is known merely by a stone, daubed from time to time with sandar or red lead.\n\nWhatever importance Sikandarpur attained during the days of the Lodis appears to have waned under the Mughals, when Musalman garrisons were no longer necessary in these parts. The town sank to the position of a small local market, noted only as the capital of a pargana. It is now in a stationary condition, lying off the regular trade routes and possessing but little commerce. The only manufactures are those of country cloth, for the production of which some twenty looms are at work, and of its or otto of roses, jasmine, and other flowers, which are grown by Koeris in the neighbourhood. At one time there was a considerable export of these essences to Bengal, but the industry has waned, though the fields of roses and jasmine are still a striking feature in the landscape.\n\nThe population of Sikandarpur in 1853 numbered 5,996 souls, and this had risen by 1881 to 7,027, while in 1891 the total was 7,422. Since that time the number of inhabitants has not increased, but rather the reverse, the census of 1901 showing a total of 7,414, of whom 2,605 were Musalmans\u2014a high proportion for this district. Most of them are Julahns, but there are a few old families of Sheikhs of good standing. The town possesses a police-station, a post-office, a cattle-pound, and a good inspection bungalow, one of the best in the district. The educational institutions comprise a middle vernacular school, an aided primary school, and two private unaided establishments. The bazaar is in the centre of the town, the market days being Sunday and Wednesday in each week. The only fair is that on the occasion of the Muharram festival, which is attended by some 9,000 persons.\n\nSikandarpur is administered under the provisions of the Act XX of 1850, and of the Sanitation Act, the former having been in force since 1860. In 1906 there were 1,479 houses in the town, and of these 380 were assessed to taxation, or less than half the number formerly subject to house-tax. The average collections\nunder this head for the three preceding years were Rs. 1,327, giving an incidence of Rs. 2-4-4 per assessed house and Rs. 0-2-10 per head of population. The total income for the same period, including the initial balance, averaged Rs. 1,689, and the expenditure Rs. 1,326; the principal items being Rs. 750 for the upkeep of the town police force, Rs. 252 for the maintenance of the conservancy staff, and Rs. 122 for local public improvements.\n\nSIKANDARPUR EAST Pargana, Tahsil Bansdih.\n\nWhen the district of Ballia was formed in 1879, the old pargana of Sikandarpur, for many years a part of the Azamgarh district, was divided into two portions, of which the eastern and smaller was included in the new tahsil of Bansdih. The present pargana is of fairly regular shape, being bounded on the west by Sikandarpur West of the Rasra tahsil, on the south by the two parganas of Kopachit, on the east by Kharid, and on the north by the Ghagra, which separates it from Gorakhpur and the Saran district of Bengal. Owing to the erratic action of the river, the area is liable to change from time to time, as considerable stretches of alluvial land are swallowed or thrown up by the stream as it takes a southerly or northerly direction. In 1906 the pargana covered in all 82,781 acres, the average for the preceding five years being 82,361 acres or 128-7 square miles.\n\nThe greater portion of the pargana belongs to the upland tract, the remainder consisting in a narrow strip of alluvial soil along the Ghagra in the north. The high bank of the river approaches close to the stream at Qutbganj in the village of Kathaura, but on either side of this point it recedes, and the land is more or less subject to inundation from the annual floods. In the portion east of Qutbganj the changes in the channel of the Ghagra are both frequent and extensive, resulting in numerous lawsuits and boundary disputes. Five dairies with an area of nearly 6,000 acres, which in former days lay on the Bengal side, became attached to this district, to which they were transferred by order of Government in March 1873. These lands are in consequence subject to a temporary settlement and come up for periodical revision. The upland tract is generally flat, though the surface is interrupted by several drainage depressions.\nGenerally speaking, the level is highest in the north, the land sloping gently southwards from the flood bank. It comprises a stretch of fertile country, well wooded and thickly populated, the soil being for the most part a sandy loam, stiffening into clay in the depressions. The village sites are usually to be found on the more elevated spots, while the lower levels are devoted almost exclusively to rice cultivation. The chief drainage line is that known as the Baheri, which passes through the south of the pargana from west to east, and ultimately joins the Ghagra near Maniar. It is joined by another small stream which rises to the south of Sikandarpur, the combined waters being frequently known as the Bajnaha. The surface of the country is dotted with numerous swamps and jhils, of which the largest are those at Siwan to the east of Sikandarpur and at Kathauna in the extreme north; both of these are fed by the Ghagra when the latter is in flood, and are of considerable value as fisheries.\n\nTaking the average of the returns for the five years ending in 1906, we find that the cultivated area of the pargana is 50,532 acres or 63-8 per cent. of the whole, the proportion closely approximating to that of the tahsil generally. Of the remainder, 11,351 acres or 13-9 per cent. are returned as barren, but this includes no less than 7,742 acres under water and 2,052 acres occupied by sites, buildings and roads; so that the actually uncultivable waste is of small extent and comprises chiefly barren sand along the Ghagra. The area shown as cultivable amounts to 14,447 acres or 17-5 per cent., though under this head come the 2,810 acres of grove land and 2,544 acres of new fallow, which is left waste but temporarily; old fallow and culturable waste proper accounting for less than 8,000 acres, while much of this is of such a character that it would hardly repay tillage.\n\nOf the two harvests the kharif is the more important, covering on an average 38,537 acres, as against 30,140 acres sown in the rabi; the double-cropped area averages 22 per cent. of the cultivation, and though this figure is the lowest in the district, the proportion has exhibited a marked tendency to increase of late years. Rice is the most important crop, occupying 38-5 per cent. of the kharif cultivation, while next comes arhar with 20 per cent., and sugarcane with 15 per cent., kodon and maize\nmaking up the bulk of the remainder. In the rabi peas and barley each constitute about 23 per cent. of the total harvest, and are closely followed by wheat, sown alone and in combination. There is also a fair amount of gram, and a comparatively large proportion of poppy cultivation, the latter amounting to 2-2 per cent., the highest average in the district. The pargana is admirably supplied with means of irrigation, which extends to 53 per cent. of the area under the plough. This figure is only exceeded in Sikandarpur West, Bhadaon, and Kopachit West, of which the two last lie wholly in the uplands, while the first contains a much smaller proportion of alluvial land, in which no irrigation is required. Fully 80 per cent. of the supply is derived from wells, and the remainder from tanks, jhils, and the smaller watercourses, the areas under these different heads varying greatly according to the nature of the season.\n\nThe standard of cultivation is generally high, although a large proportion of the land is in the hands of high caste tenants. Recent returns show that nearly 30 per cent. is tilled by proprietors, 25-7 per cent. by tenants at fixed rates, 23-5 per cent. by occupancy tenants, and 16-4 per cent. by tenants-at-will, the remainder being either rent-free or held by ex-proprietors. A large proportion of the land, amounting to nearly 22 per cent., is sublet, both by the owners and by statutory tenants. The average chilmi rental is Rs. 6-14-10 per acre, as compared with Rs. 3-5-0 paid by tenants at fixed rates and Rs. 4-1-4 by those with rights of occupancy. As is often the case in this district, the latter exceeds the rate for tenants-at-will, which averages Rs. 3-10-3, the reason being that the unprivileged classes generally hold only the inferior lands. The present revenue demand for the pargana is Rs. 60,293, while cesses amount to a farther Rs. 12,607.\n\nThe population at the census of 1881 numbered 100,825 persons, and this rose to 104,904 at the following census. The last enumeration of 1901 showed a slight decline, the total being 103,537, of whom 92,574 were Hindu, 10,931 Musalmans, and 92 of other religions. The prevailing Hindu castes are Ahirs, Rajputs, Chamars, Koeris and Brahmins. The proportion of Musalmans is unusually high, owing to the presence of the only\nlarge Muhammadan settlement in the district. This is Sikandarpur, which is the sole place in the pargana that can be described as a town. There are, however, several large villages, such as Daha Behra, Khajuri, Siwan, Pakri, Pur, Lilkar, Kathaura and Sisotar. The communications of the pargana are confined to the Ghagra and a few unmetalled roads. The latter comprise that from Ramsdih to Sikandarpur and Turtipar, following the course of the river, and those from Sikandarpur to Nagra and the district headquarters, with a branch leaving the Ballia road at Khajari and thence going to Garwar and to Phephna on the railway.\n\nThe permanent settlement of Sikandarpur took place when the pargana belonged to the Ghazipur district. It then contained 16 tappas, and these were transferred to Azamgarh in 1832. Five years later the tappa of Haveli Kharid, consisting of 48 villages, together with 29 of Kopachit were transferred to Sikandarpur, which remained in Azamgarh till the constitution of the Ballia district in 1879. The present pargana comprises the tappas of Haveli Kharid, Haveli Sikandarpur, Shah Salempur, Masumpur, and Kharsanda. The northern portion was colonised at an early date by Musalmans, and the south by Sengar and other Rajputs. The chief proprietors include the Maharaja of Qasim Bazar, who owns the Kantu Babu jagir with an area of 4,592 acres in this pargana, the Sengars of tappa Shah Salempur, the Saiyids of Kot, the Qazis of Masumpur and Qasipur, the Iraquis of Nawannagar, and the Bhuihars of Lilkar and Sisotar. Altogether, Rajputs own nearly 37 per cent. of the land, Bhuihars about 23 per cent., Musalmans 20 per cent., Brahmins seven per cent. and Kayasthas three per cent., the remainder being in the possession of other Hindus. There are in all 222 villages, at present divided into 502 mahals, of which five are temporary and the rest permanent. Of the latter only 13 are held in single remainder tenure, while 115 are joint samindari, 244 perfect, and 125 imperfect pattidar, and two are bhaiyachara. The revenue-free area is 4,838 acres, almost the whole of this being included in the Kantu Babu jagir. There is also the small village of Badha Muafi with an area of 242 acres, holding revenue-free in perpetuity by Musalmans; it forms a portion of the township of Sikandarpur.\nSIKANDARPUR WEST Pargana, Tahsil Rasra.\n\nThis is the largest pargana of the district, but it represents but a portion of the original fiscal subdivision. The latter, on its transfer from Azamgarh to the new district of Ballia in 1879, was divided between the Bansdih and Rasra tahsils, the part assigned to the latter receiving the name of Sikandarpur West. The tract extends from the Ghagra on the north, beyond which lies the district of Gorakhpur, to the Sarju, which forms the Ghazipur boundary on the south. To the west lie Azamgarh and pargana Bhadaun, and to the east are Lakhnesar, Kopeshit West and Sikandarpur East. The area, which is liable to vary from time to time by reason of the vagaries of the Ghagra, amounted in 1906 to 165,500 acres, while the average for the last five years is 165,967 acres or 259 square miles.\n\nIn its physical characteristics the pargana generally resembles Sikandarpur East, as the greater part of it belongs to the upland portion of the district and is a tract of homogeneous character. The alluvial area along the Ghagra in the north is small, and the changes in the configuration of the riparian lands are now reduced to comparatively insignificant proportions, the course of the river having been fixed for some distance by the Turtipar bridge and the training works protecting the structure. At the same time the low country on either side of Turtipar is constantly liable to inundation, the tract so affected extending westwards from Ubban to the Azamgarh boundary, while on the east there is a similar stretch of country in the neighbourhood of Bilthra and Haldi. Between these two places lies a large irregular jhil, which probably represents an old channel of the Ghagra and is connected with that river during the rains. The uplands are somewhat higher in the north than in the south, but the slope of the country is very slight. Consequently the drainage lines are generally undeveloped, and rather resemble disconnected chains of jhils than regular watercourses; most of them are quite dry during the hot weather, but in the rains they attain a considerable size and have large expanses of rice cultivation on their banks. In the extreme north-west, along the Azamgarh boundary, flows the Ahar or Haha, which has its sources in pargana Nathupur of Azamgarh. It is fed by an ill-defined\nstream known as the Pharai, which for several miles follows the boundary. With this exception the drainage passes into the Sarju, the chief lines being the Basnahi on the northern borders of pargana Bhadaon; the Lakra, which flows to the west and south of Nagra; and the Aonra Tal, which passes through the centre of the pargana to the north and east of Nagra. These three lines ultimately combine to form the Budhi, which falls into the Sarju in pargana Kopachit East. The Sarju itself washes the southern boundary for a short distance, dividing this pargana from Ghazipur. The defective drainage is further illustrated by the existence of numerous lakes and jhils dotted over the face of the country, and also by the presence of several expanses of barren land in the southern half of the tract. Save for this land, the soil is generally fertile, consisting of a light, but rich loam in the uplands and a strong clay in the depressions, admirably suited for the growth of rice.\n\nThe returns of the last five years show that on an average 107,919 acres, or 65 per cent. of the whole, are cultivated, while of this some 24 per cent. bears a double crop, the latter proportion having rapidly increased during late years. Of the remaining area 12-3 per cent. is returned as barren and 22-7 per cent. as culturable waste; but both these figures need qualification, as the former consists mainly of land under water or occupied by sites and roads, the actually uncultivable area being only 2,438 acres; while of the latter 3,749 acres or 2-28 per cent. of the whole pargana are under groves, and 7,804 acres are recent fallow, leaving 20,808 acres of old fallow and 3,136 acres of unbroken land. This so-called culturable waste is often of little value, being in many cases occupied by dhak or scrub jungle or else covered with grass, but it is probable that the pargana, more than any in the district, admits of some extension of tillage, since of late years the area under cultivation has exhibited a distinct decline. With the exception of Kopachit West and Bhadaon, this pargana shows a higher proportion of irrigated land than any other in the district; the average area watered being no less than 58 per cent. of the cultivation, while in years of drought this figure could be largely exceeded, as the construction of wells is nowhere difficult. As a rule, wells supply 74 per\ncont. of the irrigation, the remainder being equally divided between tanks and other sources, such as the jhils and watercourses, though the extent to which they are utilized depends largely on the nature of the season. The kharif area averages 73,340 acres as compared with 60,756 acres sown for the rabi harvest. The principal autumn crop is rice, averaging 44.5 per cent. of the harvest, and this is followed by sugarcane with 16.8 per cent., arhar with ten per cent., and kodon with 7.2 per cent. In the rabi peas comes first with 40 per cent., this crop being commonly sown in succession to early rice, and after this barley with 28 per cent.; wheat, both sown alone and in combination, with 18 per cent.; and gram, either sown by itself or mixed with barley, nine per cent. There is a fair amount of opium cultivation, the average being 850 acres.\n\nThe cultivating community generally resembles that of Sikandarpur East, though perhaps there is a larger proportion of the higher castes. At the present time about 25 per cent. of the area is cultivated by proprietors, 12 per cent. by tenants at fixed rates, 33 per cent. by occupancy tenants, and 28 per cent. by tenants-at-will, the remainder being rent-free or held by ex-proprietors. The area sublet is very large, amounting to nearly 27 per cent. These shikari tenants pay on an average Rs. 6-0-7 per acre, while tenants at fixed rates pay only Rs. 3-1-5, those with rights of occupancy Rs. 3-11-11, and tenants-at-will Rs. 3-14-0, the last being, as usual, in possession of the most inferior lands. The grain-rented area is much larger than in any other pargana, and includes much of the land in the neighbourhood of the jhils, where the produce is always precarious, depending entirely on the nature of the monsoon. The revenue demand in 1906 was Rs. 1,22,281, while cesses contributed a further Rs. 20,470. The pargana contains 472 villages, divided at present into 1,167 mahals. The prevailing form of proprietary right is the joint zamindari, which is found in 555 mahals, while of the rest 291 are held by single zamindars, 16 are bhaiyachara, 74 are perfect pattadar, and 229 come under the imperfect variety of the same tenure. Among the landowning castes Rajputs predominate, holding 41.6 per cent. of the land, while next come Muslims with 21 per cent., Brahmans\nwith 18 per cent., Bhuinhars with five per cent., the rest being held by other Hindus.\n\nThe population of the pargana in 1881 numbered 184,543 souls. Ten years later it was 184,192, while at the last census the total had fallen to 172,875, of whom 159,380 were Hindus, 13,400 Musalmans, and five of other religions. The only town is Turtipar, which for many years was administered under Act XX of 1850. Besides this, Nagra, Tari Baragnon and Pharsatar are villages with a large number of inhabitants, and have been separately described. The pargana is well provided with means of communication, though it has no metalled road. Through the western portion runs the line from Mau to Turtipar and Gorakhpur, with stations at Kididdapur, Bilhira Road (Siar) and Turtipar, while through the southern extremity passes that from Mau to Ballia and Rewalganj, with a station at Ratanpur on the borders of Thadaon. Most of the unmetalled roads radiate from Nagra, which has thus direct communication with Ubhaon on the north, Sikandarpur on the north-east, Garwar on the south-east, Ravra on the south, Ghazipur on the south-west, Mau on the west, and Ghosi in Azamgarh on the north-west. Parallel to the Ghagra in the north runs the road from Bansdih and Sikandarpur to Dobri-ghat, passing through Ubhaon, and other roads include that connecting Balhm with the Bilhira road station in the village of Siar; that leading from Pharsatar to the Azamgarh border; and one running north and south through the western portion, passing through Bhimpura, Bilaunjha, and Ratanpura.\n\nThe pargana originally consisted of 18 tappas, but on its transfer from the Ghazipur district to Azamgarh in 1832 four of these were added to pargana Nathmpur. In 1837 Haveli Kharid and Shah Salompur were assigned to Sikandarpur from Kharid and Kopachit respectively, these and four others being formed into Sikandarpur East subsequently to the constitution of the Ballia district in 1879. The present pargana therefore contains the eight tappas of Alapar, Sarayan, Halti, Khaira, Muhammadpur, Pharsatar, Ismailpur and Shahpur, to which was added Dhaka from pargana Zahurabad of the Ghazipur district in 1882. Several of these names show their Musalman origin, especially those in the north; but little is known of the early Muhammadan\nsettlements, and the chief event in the history of the pargana was\nthe arrival of the Ba\u00efs Rajputs in 1623. They settled at Nagra,\nand in a short time possessed themselves of the greater portion\nof the tract, conquering both the Musalmans and the other Rajput\nlandholders. The dispossessed proprietors afterwards recovered\nmuch of their estates and were admitted to engage at the permanent\nsettlement, but the Ba\u00efs still remain the leading family of the\npargana. Khaira in the north, an old Musalman colony, was\nregained by Hasan Ali after the introduction of British rule, and\nthe adjoining tappa of Pharsatar, in old days held by Sheikhs,\nwas bought up by Khadim Ali of Ghazipur, whose descendant,\nSheikh Abdul Ahad, is the largest Musalman proprietor in the\ndistrict. Tamulpur in the west is held by Sengars of the\nBarahia subdivision, having been wrested from the Ba\u00efs by\nChandan Singh of Bishunpura, while another representative of\nthe family obtained the Charauan taluka. Haldi in the north,\nadjoining Khaira, in former days belonged to Chaubari Rajputs,\nsome of whom recovered it from the Ba\u00efs, their descendants\nnow holding the tappa in conjunction with the Sheikhs of\nPharsatar. Shahpur is owned by Totiba Bhunihars, and Alapur\nand Sarayan by Donwar Rajputs, while Muhammadpur still\nbelongs to the Ba\u00efs. Dhaka is mainly held by Rajputs of the\nSengar clan. Besides those already mentioned, there are few\nlarge proprietors in the pargana, the most notable being Munshi\nMadho Lal of Bounres, who owns the Kop taluka, and the\ndescendants of the notorious amil Deokinandan Singh, who still\nretain a considerable estate.\n\nSONBARSA, Pargana DOABA, Tuhasil BALLIA.\n\nThis large village adjoins Bairia on the east, the two sites\nbeing a mile apart. That of Sonbarsa stands on the south-side\nof the road from Ballia to Revelganj, some 21 miles east from\nthe former, in 25\u00b0 48' N. and 84\u00b0 30' E. It belongs to the\nDamodarpur taluka, once held by Lohatama Rajputs, but now in\nthe possession of the Maharani of Dumraon. The old proprietors\nwere in past days noted for their sturdy independence and con-\ntinued resistance to the Dumraon authorities, and many conflicts\nthe village, which includes a large number of hamlets, is 4,000 acres, and the revenue demand Rs. 9,405. In 1881 Sonbarsa contained 8,714 inhabitants, but the total fell to 7,466 in 1891, while at the last census there was a further decline to 7,331, of whom 150 were Musalmans. The latter are Jalahas by caste, and are engaged in weaving, 15 looms being at work at the present time. Markets are held weekly in the bazar, which is known as Lalganj. Sonbarsa contains an aided school, a dispensary called the Roberta' hospital, and an inspection bungalow belonging to the Durrarao estate. Besides the main road, there are two others, one running north-east to Chand Diara station, and the other south through Murli Chhapra to the ferry over the Ganges leading to Bihia in Shahabad.\n\nSONWANI, Pargana and Tahsil Ballia.\n\nA large and straggling village on the northern borders of the pargana, situated in 25\u00b0 47' N. and 84\u00b0 19' E., some four miles south of Sahatwar and eleven miles east from Ballia, on the road connecting Sahatwar with Halidi. The southern portion forms practically a single site with Katahi and Kirpalpur, the joint population at the last census being 4,304, while that of Sonwani alone was 2,058, including 300 Musalmans. The latter are chiefly Jalahas, and a large amount of weaving is carried on, there being no fewer than 41 looms in the village. Another industry is the manufacture of sendur or red lead. Markets are held twice a week in the bazar, and an upper primary school is maintained here. The area of the village is 1,025 acres, and the proprietor is the Maharaja of Vizianagram. The land is revenue-free, having formed part of the jagir given in 1782 by Warren Hastings to Shariat-ullah Khan, whose descendants subsequently sold the property, as already narrated in Chapter III.\n\nSRINAGAR, Pargana Doana, Tahsil Ballia.\n\nA very large village in the north-west corner of the pargana, adjoining the Kharid boundary, and situated in 25\u00b0 50' N. and 84\u00b0 28' E., a short distance north of the road from Bairia to Rooti, and 24 miles from the district headquarters. Between the road and the village runs the railway, the Rooti station being\nthree miles to the west. Srinagar, like the rest of the pargana lies low, and its lands are annually inundated by the Reoti Doh and the Tongraha river on the north. Besides the main site there are several hamlets, of which four are almost contiguous, while the rest are scattered over an extensive area. The total population at the last census was 4,189, of whom all but 14 were Hindus, chiefly Rajputs of the Kakan and Anthaian clans, while Brahmins, Chamars and Ahirs are also well represented. The village forms part of the Damodarpur taluq and is owned by the Dumraon estate. For many years it was farmed by an Anthaian named Harakh Nath Singh, who became almost ruined by litigation with the Maharnja.\n\nSUKHPURA, Pargana Khairid, Tahsil Bansdih.\n\nThis large village gives its name to a taluq which was settled with Naramni Rajputs in 1790 and is still held by their descendants. It lies in 25\u00b0 51' N. and 84\u00b0 6' E., to the south of the junction of the roads from Ballia to Sikandarpur and from Garwar to Bansdih, at a distance of seven miles from both Ballia and the headquarters of the tahsil. Sukhpura is a flourishing place, containing two bazars, in which markets are held on three days of the week, four sugar factories, twenty looms and a large upper primary school. The population, which in 1881 was 4,213, dropped to 4,130 at the next census, but in 1901 had risen again to 4,227, of whom 359 were Musalmans. Rajputs are the principal inhabitants. The area of the village is 1,104 acres, and the revenue demand is Rs. 993.\n\nSUREMANPUR, Pargana Doaba, Tahsil Ballia.\n\nA village in the north of the pargana, standing in 25\u00b0 49' N. and 84\u00b0 29' E., at a distance of 24 miles from the district headquarters, and four miles north of Bairia, with which it is connected by an unmetalled road leading through Kotwa. It is chiefly noteworthy as possessing a station on the railway, which passes through the centre of the village; this station is the nearest to Bairia and the important bazar of Raniganj in Kotwa, and there is a considerable traffic between these markets and the\nSaran district. The place also possesses a post-office. Suremanpur is owned by the Maharani of Dumraon, who pays a revenue of Rs. 1,359 on a total area of 941 acres. The tenants are chiefly Brahmans, Rajputs, and Kayastha. The population at the last census numbered 1,549 persons, of whom only 14 were Musalmans.\n\nTARI BARAGAON, Pargana Sikandarpur West,\nTahsil Rasra.\n\nA considerable village lying in 25\u00b0 50' N. and 83\u00b0 50' E., on the south side of the road from Nagra to Bhimpura and Azamgarh, at a distance of three miles north-west from Nagra, eleven miles from Rasra, and 27 miles from the district headquarters. Like Nagra, it forms part of tappa Muhammadpur, and the permanent settlement was made with the Bais Rajputs of that place. In 1828 the village was sold on account of arrears of revenue, and purchased by Saiyid Ali Akbar Khan of Patna, whose descendants still retain the greater portion, though a small share has been recovered by the Bais. The total area is 1,435 acres, and the revenue Rs. 1,452. Tari Baragaon had a population of 3,180 in 1881, but the total has since declined, falling to 3,159 in 1891, while at the last census it was 2,919, including 174 Musalmans and a large number of Bais. The place is of little importance, though it contains six sugar factories, four looms, and an upper primary school. Markets are held here twice a week, but the trade is inconsiderable.\n\nTIKA DEORI, Pargana Lakhnesar, Tahsil Rasra.\n\nA village in the south-east of the pargana, standing on the left bank of the Sarju, in 25\u00b0 47' N. and 83\u00b0 54' E., at a distance of five miles from Rasra and some 16 miles from the district headquarters. About a mile to the west runs the road from Rasra to Lathudih in the Ghazipur district; the river is crossed by a ferry belonging to the zamindars. The population in 1891 numbered 2,725, and ten years later it had risen to 2,804; but at the last census a marked decline was observed, the total being 2,150, of whom 495 were Musalmans. The principal residents are Songar Rajputs, who have held the village since\nthe permanent settlement: the total area is 874 acres and the revenue Rs. 510. Tika Deori possesses a lower primary school, a weekly market, a sugar factory and a number of looms for weaving country cloth. The embroidery done in the village was once of importance. The industry has declined, but there is still some output of masnads, gaddis, jhuds or elephant-trappings, saddles, and patki cloths.\n\nTURTIPAR, Pargana SIKANDARPUR WEST, Tahsil RASRA.\n\nA small town in the north of the pargana, standing on the right bank of the Ghagra in 26\u00b0 9' N. and 83\u00b0 5' E., at a distance of 36 miles from Ballia and 20 miles from the tahsil headquarters. To the east of the town runs the branch line of the Bengal and North-Western Railway, crossing the river by a large girder bridge, of which some mention has been made in Chapter II. A short distance to the south is the railway station, in the village of Sirar, close to the road from Sikandarpur to Dohri-ghat; this latter is joined at Ulshaun by a second road running south to Nagra and Rasra. Turtipar was for several years linked with Bilthra, so as to form a single town for the purposes of Act XX of 1856, but owing to the decline of the place the measure was withdrawn in June 1902. The population in 1881 numbered 6,307 persons, and this had dropped to 4,719 ten years later. At the last census the place contained 4,500 inhabitants, including 433 Musulmans and a large community of Kandu Banias. This excludes the population of Atwa, a small hamlet to the west, in which 517 persons were enumerated. There was formerly a large trade in cloth, timber, tobacco, and salt, these commodities being imported by the Ghagra and carried southwards by a road to Rasra. The railway has since supplanted the road, but the trade has undergone a great decline, especially in the matter of cloth. The only manufacture of the place is that of brass vessels, which have some local reputation; the quantity produced has diminished of late years, as owing to the quarrels between the zamindars many of the workers have crossed the river. There is also a saltpetre refinery. Markets are held twice a week in the bazar, and at Sonadil, some three miles to the west, a large fair is held.\nannually in Chait and lasts for seven days; it is in honour of Bhagwati, and attracts some 20,000 persons from the neighbourhood, while the gathering affords an occasion for a considerable amount of commerce. There is an upper primary school in Turtipar, but nothing else of any importance. The place is included in the old Musalman tappa of Khaira, so called from a village of that name about a mile higher up the river. The village lands are 1,221 acres in extent, and are assessed at Rs. 927: the greater portion is still held by Musalmans, but a part has passed by purchase into the hands of Brahmans.\n\nUBHAON, Pargana Sikandarpur West, Tahsil Rasra.\n\nThis small village lies in the north of the pargana, in 26\u00b0 8' N. and 83\u00b0 53' E., on the road leading from Sikandarpur to Turtipar and Dohri-ghat at a distance of 34 miles from Ballia and 18 miles from the tahsil headquarters. It is connected with the latter by a branch road which here takes off and leads southwards to Nagra, while a third runs to Siar or Bilthra Road station. The place is only of importance as possessing a police station, located at the junction of the roads equidistant from Turtipar on the north, Bilthra on the east, and Siar on the south-west. There is also a cattle-pound, while there are post-offices at Bilthra and Siar. The population at the last census numbered only 536 souls, of whom 336 were Musalmans, chiefly Sheikhs. The village is included in the old tappa of Khaira, and the Sheikhs are still the proprietors, though a portion of land has been sold to Brahmans. The total area is 207 acres and the revenue Rs. 144. At the beginning of the 18th century the owners were dispossessed by the Bais Rajputs of Nagra, but they eventually recovered their rights by the decree of a British court.\nGazetteer of
