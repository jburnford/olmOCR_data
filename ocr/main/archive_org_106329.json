The error of the time-keeper, between the longitude corrected by sight observations of the Moon, is supposed to have arisen by the time-keeper having a rate of going uniformly between these observations; and the intermediate longitudes determined by the time-keeper on this supposition. Where no observations were made, it is deduced by the account from the last observation of the longitude is then included within [ ].\n\n10th, The magnetical observations of the variation and dip, in seven columns:\n\n1st, The variation by azimuth, * before, denoting the observation to have been in the morning; * after, denoting the observation to have been in the evening. The variation was observed by the official compass belonging to the ship.\n\n3d, The dip with the face of the instrument to the East.\n\n4th, Ditto, ditto, ditto, West.\n\n5th, The mean dip of the foregoing observations.\n\n6th, The mean corrected, or what is supposed to be the true dip.\n\n7th, The circumstances under which the observations of the dip were made.\n\n12th, The miles run by log.\n\nThe dip was observed with a dipping-needle belonging to the hon. Mr. Sisson.\n\nThe following remarks on the dipping-needle and observations are by Mr. C. A. The ends of the axis of the dipping-needle are made conical, and turn in a ring of bell-metal, in the manner of Mr. Lorimer's needle, described in Phil. Trans. vol. LXVI. p. 79. The dip was constantly observed both with the face of the instrument to the East and to the West, and the poles were changed twice during the voyage, in order whether the needle continued well balanced. The use of this method of observation is explained in Phil. Trans. vol. LXVI. p. 396.\nThe mean dip corrected is what is supposed; the correction is as follows.\n\nBy the observations on July 12th, when the marked end of the needle was too heavy, and too low at that place; and therefore, if we suppose the dip to be strong in all parts of the earth, the error will be 1/6ths of a degree as the cosine of the dip. The observations made within a short period of each other, by the longitude corrected by sight of land or moon made within a short period of each other, by the time-keeper having altered its position; and the intermediate longitudes are observed by the observation of the time-keeper. Where no observations of the time-keeper are made within the last observation of the time, and\n\nof a degree from the mean dip,\n\nwhen the mean dip is between\n\nBut as before the needle left London, there was a difference in the dip, the correction in the dip is great, videlicet;\n\nof a degree is subtracted from the dip, when that\n\nThe dip was observed on board the Grenville, in the part of the ship in which the observation was made more than 5' from that observed with the needle about five miles distant; so that the observation was much influenced by the iron-work of the ship.\nThe mean dip corrected is what is supposed to be the true dip. The foundation of this supposition is as follows.\n\nObservations on July 12th, when the poles were changed, it appears, that the end of the needle was too heavy, so as to make that end point \\(\\frac{1}{16}\\)ths of a degree from that place; and therefore, if we suppose that the force of magnetism is equally distributed over all parts of the earth, the error produced thereby in other places should be to the degree as the cosine of the dip to the radius. The observations also made when the poles were changed at Suez, agree well enough with this supposition: therefore, as in those observations the marked end of the needle pointed to the North, the mean dip in the part of the voyage subsequent to July 12th is corrected by subtracting\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{degree from the mean dip,} & \\quad \\begin{cases} \n63^\\circ \\text{ and } 52^\\circ \\\\\n52^\\circ \\quad 43^\\circ \\\\\n43^\\circ \\quad 30^\\circ \\\\\n30^\\circ \\quad 0^\\circ \n\\end{cases} \\\\\n\\text{when the mean dip is between} & \\quad \\begin{cases} \n70^\\circ \\text{ and } 62^\\circ \\\\\n62^\\circ \\quad 52^\\circ \\\\\n52^\\circ \\quad 43^\\circ \\\\\n43^\\circ \\quad 35^\\circ \\\\\n35^\\circ \\quad 30^\\circ \\\\\n30^\\circ \\quad 25^\\circ \\\\\n25^\\circ \\quad 0^\\circ \n\\end{cases}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nNorth, and adding as much when the dip is as much South.\n\nBefore the needle left London, changing the poles was found to make very little difference in the dip, the correction in the preceding part of the voyage is made not so great;\n\nIt was observed on board the Grenville at Deptford, after her return, in the same ship in which the observations were usually made, and was found not to differ much from that observed with the same needle in a pretty large garden in London, three miles distant; so that the observations on board the Grenville seem to be not much influenced by the iron-work of the ship.\n| Th. | Marine Barometer | Weather and Winds | D.L. | D.L. | Longitude |\n|-----|------------------|-------------------|------|------|-----------|\n|     | R.

Several small land birds; two of them, supposed nightingales came on board, very tired; also saw a hawk.\n\nLight airs of wind Easterly, with calms. Some swallows and other land birds, who seem very tired. In the afternoon, during the calm, when the ship's head was to the Southward, there was, for a little time, a counter current visible; it made like a wake on the ship's larboard beam, as if she was going broadside foremost.\n\nLight airs of wind throughout. P.M. saw two three-mast vessels with lateen sails; they were supposed to be Barbary cruisers, but did not come near enough to let us know what they were. Some swallows about the ship.\n\nAn increasing breeze from the Northward. In the morning there were many petrels in the ship's wake: they continued throughout the day.\n\nFresh breezes, with some squalls. At noon saw Porto Santo from the mast-head, W by S. per compass.\n\nIn Funchal road. Major Sears informed us, that Mr. Sears, in consequence of our request, tried the therm. for 30' in a cool cellar, and found it 68\u00b0. N.B. Captain Alcock informed me, he observed the therm. on May 14, 1776, at 6 A.M. at Funchal 68\u00b0, and in the cellar 61\u00b0; and Mr. Sears wrote to Mr. Cavendish, that on the 16th of May the therm. which stood at 69\u00b0, was carried down at 1 P.M. to a cellar, where it remained till 4 o'clock, and then was found to be at 62\u00b0, so that Major Sears's account was probably erroneous.\n\nFirst part, light airs. Middle and latter, pleasant breezes and smooth weather; several boats came off from Funchal.\n\nThese 24 hours pleasant breeze from Eastward.\n| Th. | Marine Barometer | Weather and Winds |\n|-----|------------------|-------------------|\n|     | R.

At noon, Peak of Tenerif (variation allowed) bore N 24\u00b0 36' E., which bearing, and the difference of latitude places it 27\u00b0 to the Eastward of our situation at noon, when in 16\u00b0 55' long. by time-keeper, and consequently by time k. 16 28 is the longitude of Peak of Tenerif, only 4' less than Perc\u00e9 Feuille makes it; but, by the observations of the Moon, on the 21st and following days, it appears, the ship was 1\u00b0 farther West than the time-keeper represented, which difference arose since the 9th of May, if the Lunar observations were to be relied on.\n\n70 Light breezes and smooth water throughout. Several petrills in the wake.\n\nPleasant trade. In Captain Exetero's chart there being foundings laid down not far to the Eastward of our situation, founded at 8 P.M. but had no ground 40 fath.

T.S. 69\u00b0.\n\n153 These 24 hours a fresh trade, and mostly fair weather, the water remaining the same as before. T.S. 68\u00bd.\n\nFresh trade and hazy weather. In the afternoon the sea remarkably confused, breaking different ways. Sounded in the morning, but had no ground 40 fath. In the morning the water appeared blue again. T.S. 71\u00b0.\n\nLight breezes chiefly. In the night, no ground 70 fath. There were many blubbers in the ship's wake, which made a very luminous appearance; they seemed in shape like a sausage about 8 or 9 inches long. In the day, tea was covered with Portuguese men of war, of which took up several; also some pilot-fish and skip-jacks.
