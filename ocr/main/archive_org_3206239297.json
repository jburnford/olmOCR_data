Applicant expressed his extraordinary surprise, but one of the officers persisted in taking him through the streets to Pimlico station, where he was detained, as he was informed, upon some charge of burglary or something in the country; until the arrival of some detective from somewhere, who said he was not the man who was wanted, and he was then told he was at liberty. He wanted redress for the insult and wrong he had endured, and applied to the Commissioner of Police, who, after some time occupied in investigating the matter, told him that his remedy was before a police magistrate, and he had accordingly waited upon his worship.\u2014Mr. Woolrych said as represented it was a case of great hardship and grievance, but it seemed to him to be the subject of an action for another court\u2014it was a mistake.\u2014Applicant repeated that he had been told his remedy was before a police magistrate. He had suffered a gross injustice and exposure before a lady of his acquaintance and the public in the daytime, and he looked for the redress to which he was entitled.\u2014Mr. Woolrych said he would make some inquiries into the matter if the applicant would come again on Monday.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3206239297.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 1384, "total-output-tokens": 406, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 1809, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
