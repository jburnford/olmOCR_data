It was, in his opinion, the bounden duty of every Englishman to thank Mr. Gladstone for his past conduct as a politician (cheers).\u2014Putting an interpretation different from that of previous speakers on the Premier's statement that he would think thrice before going to work to abolish the House of Lords, Mr. Odger regarded this as a hint that he would wait until he had the more pronounced support of the people. It was true, as Mr. Gladstone had said, that they thought too much of the Lords; they had a sneaking regard for them\u2014the regard of a sneak, not that of a man (cheers). Let them discard this feeling altogether, and at a future meeting express their opinions on the question in unmistakeable terms (cheers). Mr. Gladstone's earnestness in the cause of progress had never been equalled by any prime minister; but with the present House of Commons no statesman, were he an angel from Heaven come down to legislate, could carry any good measure. He would therefore add to the resolution a hope that in the future Mr. Gladstone would take into his Government men of more earnestness and sympathy with the wants and claims of the working people.\u2014With this rider the resolution approving of Mr. Gladstone's policy was adopted.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3206238108.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 1062, "total-output-tokens": 561, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 2457, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
