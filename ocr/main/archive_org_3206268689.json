I did not tell him that if he answered certain questions I would repay him or that he would lose nothing by it. I did not tell him I would recoup him for any loss for giving evidence for the Times. I did not offer him anything for loss of time. I never offered him money to give evidence. He never said he would require money before he went into the witness-box. On the occasion of the interview at Mr. Beauchamp\u2019s house, Mr. Beauchamp came in and said, \u201cThis is Mr. Walker, who is acting on behalf of the Times.\u201d I told him Molloy wanted a guarantee. He told Molloy it was all right. Molloy paused for a moment. He said he would make the statement to me. Mr. Beauchamp is not agent for the Times, and if Mr. Soames had sworn that he was it is not within my knowledge. I communicated with Mr. Houston, secretary of the Irish Loyal and Patriotic league, with reference to the guarantee. I have been in Mr. Beauchamp\u2019s employ three years. Before that I was engaged in the election at South Tyrone by Mr. Russell in the first instance, and afterwards by the Loyal and Patriotic league.\n\nWhat is your pay from the Times?\u2014I never heard anything about pay at all. I have been paid nothing. I have seen several witnesses on behalf of the Times, and have taken the statements of some. I have taken the statements of two witnesses who have given evidence before the commission. The prisoner\u2019s statement was one, and Thomas O\u2019Connor\u2019s was another.\n\nAre you aware that he has made a sworn retraction of the evidence given by him before the Commission, and that the statement was false?\u2014I can only say that the Freeman\u2019s Journal has published a statement to that effect, which I don\u2019t believe. I have an action against the Freeman\u2019s Journal for libel. I do not believe that Thomas O\u2019Connor made the statement.\n\nAfter being formally cautioned the prisoner said: I plead \u201cNot guilty.\u201d I reserve my defence; I have nothing to say.\n\nHe was committed for trial.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3206268689.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 1108, "total-output-tokens": 580, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 2354, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
