The occurrence took place about half-past ten o'clock, after the mother of the children had gone out marketing, leaving them undressed and in bed in her room, which is on the second floor. Shortly afterwards the landlady, a Mrs. Woolley, noticed a smell of fire, and proceeding to Mrs. Rofe's apartment, which was unlocked, she found the place full of smoke and the bed in flames. The fire was not extinguished till after the firemen had arrived, and they found the charred remains of the elder girl on the floor, while the baby, also dead, was lying in the bed. At the time Mrs. Rofe went out leaving her children there was a fire in the grate, with a guard in front. It is conjectured that the child Florence must have got out of bed to play with the light, and that, accidentally setting her night-gown on fire, she rushed to the bed and ignited the bed-clothes. The father of the deceased children, a barge breaker, was away at work at the time of the occurrence.\n\nA BRAVE MAN KILLED.\u2014On Friday afternoon a sad accident happened to Henry Ambert, a labourer in the employ of the Kensal-green Gas Works. He was engaged on some repairs of the Gas Company just below the Brondesbury Bridge, crossing the London and North-Western Railway in Willesden-lane, when a horse attached to a heavily-laden cart belonging to Messrs. Bowyer, the contractors, took fright at the whistling of a locomotive and dashed down the incline at a great speed. Ambert rushed forward and endeavoured to check the horse by grasping the reins, but, missing his hold, fell under the wheels, which passed over his chest, crushing him dreadfully. The poor fellow was as speedily as possible removed to St. Mary's Hospital, but life was extinct ere he arrived there.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3200810216.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 1476, "total-output-tokens": 500, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 1973, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
