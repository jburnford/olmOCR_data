and an account of the circumstances under which the settlement of the district was finally ordered is contained in pages 100-114 inclusive. It will, therefore, be sufficient to state here that, prior to this settlement, the revenue demand was not based on any survey or measurement of the occupied land. Even at its origin the shist was incorrect, and based on no measurements. In the numerous changes of government which had taken place since the Vijayanagar settlement all traces of the shist had been lost. The demand as it existed at the commencement of the Company's rule was in part composed of different imposts having no relation to the extent or produce of the land. Its distribution among the ryots had been, up to that time, left to the discretion of the karniks and shanbhogues and was therefore very unequal.\n\nThe history of the district for the first 40 years of the nineteenth century consists of a series of attempts to equalize this demand on the different holdings. In the absence of any survey these were doomed to failure. From the first, Munro had expressed an opinion that such modifications were unnecessary, as assessments unequal in their origin tended to become equal by the course of time. There is evidence to show that these attempts to equalize the assessment, so far from achieving their object, increased the existing inequalities of the assessment and enabled the rich and influential to still further divest themselves of their share of the assessment at the expense of the poor.\n\nThe revenue survey began work in 1889 and completed the last taluk in 1896. A mistake which led to much delay was made in the attempt to take the \"warg\" as the unit for the survey field. The warg had long ceased in most cases to be the unit of ownership, and only remained the revenue unit in theory. The demarcation of wargs, therefore, did not separate the lands owned by different persons. It incidentally had the effect of including wet, dry and bagayat as well as different descriptions of wet in the same survey field. Many of the fields became of an unmanageable size, and the number of sub-divisions, limited by the survey rules to ten in each field, sometimes exceeded a hundred.\n\nSettlement operations began in October 1894, and at once brought to light the fact that the existing survey could not be made the basis\n\n---\n\n1 Manual of the South Canara district compiled by J. Sturrock, I.C.S., (Madras Government Press, 1894).\n2 Munro's letter, dated 31st May 1800.\nof any scheme of settlement as it stood. Accordingly supplementary surveys were undertaken to sub-divide the different descriptions of land. The classification of the soils, and counting of trees in bagayats, together with these revision surveys went on up to 1903. The Commissioners of Revenue Settlement visited the district on several occasions during these operations; the scheme report for K\u00e1sarag\u00f3d and Mangalore was submitted in 1898; that for the Udipi and Coondapoor taluks in the following year. Final orders were passed on these proposals in G.O. No. 757, Revenue, dated 25th August 1902.\n\nThe general principles finally adopted for the settlement of the district were as follows:\n\nWet lands.\n\nWet land was defined as land levelled and bunded and adapted to the cultivation of paddy, i.e., of wet paddy; dry paddy is seldom grown in this district except in the kumaris. All wet land was divided into three classes: first, second and third. First-class wet lands are lands giving two wet crops, the irrigation of which is ordinarily by direct flow. Second-class wet lands are lands giving two wet crops, the second mainly by baling, also lands giving one wet and one dry crop, patla and mogaru lands, and other low-lying wet lands, which, owing to their favourable position, have an unfailing supply of water for the first crop. Third-class wet lands are all less favourably situated wet lands.\n\nGardens.\n\nAfter some discussion it was decided to class all bagayats under seven sorts, the rates of assessment varying from Rs. 2 to Rs. 8 an acre. A garden containing less than ten bearing coconut trees to the acre was treated as dry. The marginally-noted trees have been considered as 'garden' trees for the purpose of this definition.\n\n| Number equivalent to one coconut tree |\n|--------------------------------------|\n| Cocoanut                             | ... 12 |\n| Arecanut                             | ... \u00bd  |\n| Jack                                 | ... 4  |\n| Mango                                |       |\n| Tamarind                             |       |\n| Pepper                               |       |\n| Palmyra                              |       |\n\nDuring the original classification the jack, cocoanut and areca were the only trees counted, except in the area classed as \"garden-bettu\" which was all reinspected before settlement on receipt of the Government orders defining \"bagayats\". No reclassification of gardens was made, and, therefore, except in the cases where a garden was reinspected in the course of settlement, the mango, palmyra, tamarind, and pepper-vine have not been taken into account. Had they been counted, a considerable addition would have resulted both to the bagayat area and to the rates on lands already classed as bagayat. The cashew-nut, which yields a large income, has not been taken into account owing to the practical difficulty of working out any scheme of assessment to deal with it. All these facts should be considered at the next revision of the settlement. The bagayats have been\ngenerally assessed at disproportionately low rates in comparison with wet and dry lands, and the area gardens in particular at much lower rates than in the adjoining districts of North Canara and Mysore.\n\nThe second crop charge on lands registered at settlement as regularly growing two crops has been consolidated at one-fourth of the single crop charge. No charge is made for occasional second crop, and when a second wet crop is raised on land classed as single crop no extra charge will be made during the currency of the present settlement.\n\nAs there are no Government irrigation works in this district, the grouping of wet lands was based on their proximity to the sea-coast. Villages near the sea-coast have the advantage of a healthy climate, abundant labour, proximity to markets, and higher prices for all their produce. In the four coast taluks three groups were at first formed on this basis. A special coast group, practically confined to the villages actually on the sea-coast, was afterwards formed to remedy a defect of the Deputy Commissioner's first proposals viz., the disproportionately low rates, resulting in many cases in a considerable decrease on the old revenue, in the coast villages. The lands in these villages are the most valuable in the district. The decrease was largely due to the lower money values assigned to the VIII, XII and XIII series of soils, which predominate in these villages. To some extent this defect has been remedied by the formation of the coast group. These villages, however, still remain the most lightly assessed under the new rates.\n\nThe Uppinangadi taluk has no sea-board. The interior is densely covered with forest, and the climate is in consequence malarious in parts. A fourth group was therefore constituted to meet the special circumstances of this taluk.\n\nThe settlement was introduced into the taluks in the following order:\n\n| Taluk       | Area (acres) |\n|-------------|--------------|\n| Mangalore   | 1312         |\n| K\u00e1sarag\u00f3d   |              |\n| Udipi       | 1313         |\n| Coondapoor  |              |\n| Uppinangadi | 1314         |\n\nThe area of the district is 2,571,923 acres of which only 737,142 acres are occupied. Deducting the kumari area, which is occupied only for fugitive cultivation, the actual occupied area is 596,265 acres, only 23 per cent. of the total area of the district. Reserved forests account for an area of 562,895 acres out of the remainder. Where this has been shown as reserved forests in the classification register, it has been entered as poramboke. The balance of reserved forests is included in the unoccupied dry area. Dry cultivation is seldom\nattempted on dry lands in this district. The dry crops that are grown are usually sown in the wet lands after the rice crops have been cut. Excluding 'dry' land, the really 'unoccupied' arable land is therefore extremely small, 1,102 acres of wet and 438 of garden. Part of this is waste lying in or near the reserved forests. Some of it is land occupied without authority, and is under enquiry. It is probable that after settlement some more waste wet lands in the middle of or adjacent to the forests will be resigned. Up to this time it was not possible to resign such lands without also resigning the whole warg to which they were attached. The large unoccupied dry area of 1,155,217 acres is mostly uncultivable. Here and there paddy fields could be made by expensive levelling and terracing. This process is always going on, and will receive some impetus from the fact that the average settlement dry rates are lower than the old minimum darkhast rate, As. 9-7 as against Re. 1 an acre. Most of the area will always remain waste, available for grazing, for cutting thatching grass, green leaves for manure, and other purposes subsidiary to agriculture.\n\n| Taluk       | Incidence of assessment per occupied acre. | Percentage of increase by settlement. |\n|-------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n|             | Before settlement.                        | After settlement.                    |\n| Coondapoor  | Rs.

The settlement assessment is Rs. 23,41,260. The marginal table shows the incidence of the old and new assessment on the whole occupied area, and the rate of increase in each taluk.\n\nThis table brings out the fact that the rate of increase rises in proportion to the distance of the taluks from Nagar, the capital of the Bednore dynasty. Munro states that the poligars of the Mangalore Hobli, which appears to have included the greater portion of the three southern taluks, were enabled by the distance which lay between them and Nagar to resist the imposition of some of the extra assessments which were exacted from the northern taluks. In fifteen villages in the south of the K\u00e1sarag\u00f3d taluk the revenue assessment was less than one rupee an acre. The old revenue was the assessment paid to the sovereign, not that which was collected from the people by their local chiefs, the amount of which is not known.\n\nThe figures show that the settlement assessment is evenly distributed and the differences in the percentage of increase are due to the inequalities in the incidence of the old assessment.\nOf the settlement demand, 80 per cent. is paid by the wet lands, and 51 per cent. of the wet assessment is paid by first-class wet lands (lands growing two or more wet crops by direct flow, without resort to artificial irrigation).\n\n| Wet\u2014 | Rs.

The course adopted has been to issue separate pattas to the pattadar for that portion of his land which is let on m\u00falg\u00e9ni. A separate patta has been issued for each tenant. In the event of the pattadar refusing to pay, the land itself is proceeded against in the first instance. The tenant then pays the assessment to avoid the loss of his tenure which would be entailed if the land were brought to sale for arrears of revenue. The area under m\u00falg\u00e9ni has turned out to be less than 10 per cent. of the whole occupied area. It is not known in how many cases the settlement assessment is more than the m\u00falg\u00e9ni rent. In recent years, and certainly during the 20 years which have elapsed since the intention of Government to revise the assessment was communicated to the public, the tenant has been bound by a special clause to pay any enhancement made at settlement. In many cases the rent was raised when it was given on m\u00falg\u00e9ni (instead of a lump sum being exacted) and is now higher than the ch\u00e1lg\u00e9ni (temporary) leases on similar lands. The cases in which the assessment is really less than the rent are usually leases of old date. The increase in assessment is most probably due, in such cases, to the extension of cultivation on the part of the tenant, who is, therefore, the proper person to pay the enhanced assessment.\u00b9\n\n(2) House-sites.\u2014Formerly land applied for for building purposes was assessed at the special rate of Rs. 6 even outside towns. In future, the special rates for house-sites will be confined to the towns shown in the margin. At settlement the special rates were imposed only on lands previously assessed at special rates (the lands known as ncl-terige, ghar-terige, sirdhar ghar-terige, etc.).\n\n\u00b9 Para. 19 of G.O. No. 757, Revenue, dated 25th August 1902\nIn addition to the area assessed as house-site at settlement, there are 78 acres of freehold and 83 acres of grant land in the town of Mangalore for which permanent pattas have been issued by the Collector. Outside towns, house-sites have been assessed at dry rates, when the number of garden trees in the sub-division was not sufficient to constitute the area a bagayat. House-sites in bagayat have not been sub-divided. Not only would it often be a difficult matter to sub-divide them, but allowance has been made in fixing the bagayat rates for the inclusion of such small unprofitable areas. When situated in wet land, which is not often the case, house-sites have been sub-divided when the area was more than 10 per cent. of the area of the sub-division.\n\n(3) Kumari.\u2014The warg kumaris of the K\u00e1sarag\u00f3d taluk have been treated as occupied warg lands, and assessed at wet rates, after allowing 50 per cent. for unprofitable areas, of one, two and, three annas an acre, according to the group in which the village lies. Three groups were formed, with reference to proximity of the kumaris to markets, and the state of their kumaris.\n\nWhen the land is brought under permanent cultivation of any kind, the settlement assessment fixed for the soil and group will be imposed. The total area of warg kumari is 140,877 acres, and the average rate per acre is As. 2\u20131. The old assessment on this area was only seven pies an acre.\n\n(4) M\u00falpattas.\u2014In G.O., No. 369 Revenue, dated 16th April 1904, it was ordered that the survey of m\u00falpatta lands left out of demarcation at the time of survey should be carried out under Act IV of 1897 by the Settlement department. M\u00falpatta wastes, in the sense of lands never brought under cultivation, were ordered to be assessed at the rate of four annas an acre, in view of the large areas of some of the old m\u00falpatta lands. In a few cases it was found that wet lands belonging to m\u00falpatta had been omitted at survey. These, and other improved lands, were assessed at the settlement rates. The number of m\u00falpattas admitted and the area surveyed as m\u00falpatta in the various taluks is shown in the following table:\u2014\nStatement showing the result of the Mulpatta survey.\n\n| Taluk       | Number of mulpatta claims received | Number of petitions rejected as having no mulpatta or having no unclaimed waste or forest land in them | Number of mulpatta claims admitted | Area admitted |\n|-------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------|\n|             |                                   |                                                                                                 |                                   | Wet.         |\n|             |                                   |                                                                                                 |                                   | Assessment.  |\n| (1)         | (2)                               | (3)                                                                                             | (4)                               | (5)          |\n| Mangalore   | 597                               | 1,004                                                                                           | 444                               | 364          |\n| K\u00e1sarag\u00f3d   | 167                               | 337                                                                                             | 147                               | 119          |\n| Udupi       | 155                               | 506                                                                                             | 173                               | 181          |\n| Coondapoor  | 188                               | 549                                                                                             | 175                               | 138          |\n| Uppinangadi | 152                               | 210                                                                                             | 89                                | 72           |\n| Total       | 1,257                             | 2,608                                                                                            | 1,028                             | 824          |\n\nArea admitted\u2014cont.\n\n| Taluk       | Garden.

The total number according to the taluk lists is 1,257. The increase is due to the fact that the taluk lists contained many darkhan patias, and these have been rejected.\n\nS. CAN. 5\n(5) (Kumakis, kans, b\u00e1nes.\u2014In G.O. No. 1190, Revenue, dated 30th December 1902, it was decided that the question of assessing kumaki lands should not form part of the settlement.\n\nThe question of kans and b\u00e1nes was dealt with in G.O. No. 413, Revenue, dated 19th April 1904. It has been decided to acquire the pepper right in kans when required for forest reservation under the Forest Act. B\u00e1n\u00e9s, when required for reservation, will be reallocated by the Revenue Department in suitable localities in the proportion of two acres\\(^1\\) to each acre of cultivated land. A special form of patta for kans which are admitted, and which are not required for forest reservation, has been prescribed in G.O. No. 213, Revenue, dated 8th March 1905.\n\nThe manner in which increment remissions were granted is described as follows in paragraph 18 of the settlement notification:\n\n\"Where the settlement assessment in any individual patta is higher than the present revenue demand, the excess will be collected by annual increments as follows:\u2014If the increase exceeds 25 per cent., an amount equal to the old assessment plus 25 per cent. thereof will be levied at once, and the remainder by instalments equal to \\(12\\frac{1}{2}\\) per cent. of the old assessment. Where, however, such instalments will not admit of the full revised assessment being reached by the twelfth year, the remainder (i.e., the increase over 25 per cent.) will be levied in eleven equal instalments. It is, however, to be clearly understood that, if the whole or a portion of the lands held by a pattadar at settlement is transferred or relinquished subsequent to settlement, the full settlement assessment will be charged for the lands remaining in his patta and for those which have passed to other hands. This rule, however, will not apply to cases in which the change in the holding may be due to causes beyond the ryot\u2019s control; for example, where a portion of his land is washed away by a river or where a piece of land is taken up for public purposes. In such cases the excess assessment upon what remains of the holding will be levied in the same number of instalments as fixed for the entire holding. Similarly when one of the joint holders of a patta transfers his interest therein, either to the co-pattadar or to a stranger, increment remission will not be forfeited by such transfer. Increases of Rs. 3 and under will be charged at once whatever the percentage may be.\"\n\nThe total amount of increment remission granted for the whole district amounts to Rs. 33,84,537. It is noticeable that though the rate of increase for the whole district is only 65 per cent., the increment remissions extend to the full twelve years in all the taluks. This is due to the extreme inequality of the old assessment. Even in the Coondapoor taluk where the settlement increase is only 22 per cent. which would be collected in one year had the old assessment\n\nG.O. No. 48, Revenue, dated 9th January 1902.\nbeen equitably distributed, the increment remissions extend to the twelfth year.\n\nAccording to the return made by the Collector to the Board in Rent roll. fasli 1310, there were only 48,533 pattadars in the district, of which ten only were joint pattas. The settlement pattas are 89,654. Under the old system the kudutales into which the old wargs had been in almost all cases split up, were not recognized as pattas. Although the warg had in most cases long ceased to be the unit of ownership, the warg was still the only unit recognized by the Revenue Department. The kudutale was merely a division of the warg to facilitate collection. In the last resort, arrears due on the land of one kudutaledar which could not be collected otherwise were realized by the sale of the whole warg. In practice this very seldom occurred. The old system was, however, in fact a joint patta system, disguised by the creation of separate kudutales. In many cases of joint family property there had never been any division of the property. All that had been divided was the income, and the separate registration into kudutales only showed the proportionate amount of the assessment which each member of the family had agreed to pay out of his share of the income. Even when the land itself had been divided, it was often not separately surveyed. In all these cases joint pattas had to be issued at settlement to all the registered kudutaledars. As a rule, they applied for sub-division of the property and separate registration. When there was no dispute as to the share of each this request was always complied with. In many cases, too, families whose property had remained registered in the name of one member up till then, availed themselves of the opportunity afforded by the settlement to divide their land into separate shares.\n\nThus although, had kudutales been shown as pattas in the revenue rent roll, the increase in the number of pattas by settlement would not appear so large, the preparation of the new pattas, and the measurement of the different shares involved a great deal of work. Registration was amended in the case of 127,018 sub-divisions at settlement. A large number of new sub-divisions were also measured to sub-divide different holdings.\n\nIn the settlement report it is shown that the price of first and second sort rice, the main staple of the district, has risen 171 per cent. and 194 per cent. respectively since Munro's settlement, or a rise of 182 per cent. taking both together.\n\nIt is also shown in the same report that a comparison of the old areas with the survey areas of 21 m\u00falpatta wargs reveals the fact that there has been an average increase of 90 per cent. by survey. The conclusion is, that after allowing half the increase in price for the increased cost of cultivation and living, the old assessment should have been enhanced by 181 per cent. if it had been desired to restore\nthe Government demand to the same proportion that it was fixed at by Munro.\n\nThe chief objection which was always urged by those who were opposed to any revision of the assessment in this district was that any enhancement of the assessment would result in a 'boulevard' of land values.\n\nAn examination of the sale-deeds of 45 properties in the Mangalore taluk, which have changed hands recently before and after settlement, shows that this anticipation has been falsified by the result. In eight cases the price after settlement is lower, in 13 cases it is unchanged, and in 24 cases the price is higher than before.\n\nThe following extract from the administration report of the District Registrar for 1904 points to the same conclusion:\n\nHigher sales advanced 14 per cent. in 1904 as compared with the preceding year. Higher mortgages rose 7 per cent. \"The fact that the higher sales and mortgages have advanced in 1904 goes to show that land is still considered a safe investment, and that the period of suspense that accompanied the survey and settlement operations in the district has been followed by a period of security.\"\n\nIn paragraph 4 (4) of the letter of the Government of India, No. 3371 of 1st November 1902, it is stated that besides the brief account of the settlement operations, an account of the chief changes disclosed in the state of affairs described in the first volume of this Gazetteer should be included.\n\nThe remarks under this head will be confined to a discussion of the rent and sale-unit of land current among the people (the bijwari mura), and the rates of rents paid by tenants to landlords up to the time of settlement. Under both these heads the information given in the District Manual no longer represents the existing state of affairs. Before there had been any survey it was, in fact, hardly possible to get correct information on these points. In paragraph 28 of the scheme report for Mangalore and K\u00e1sarag\u00f3d the Deputy Commissioner has followed the District Manual in taking one mudi as equal to one acre. This is incorrect as will be seen below.\n\nThe 'bijwari mudi' (measure of land by seed capacity) generally means the Mangalore mudi of 42 seers. Where another mudi is meant, the fact is usually stated. The argile mudi of 50 seers prevails in a small tract within a radius of about 15 to 20 miles of Mangalore town. In the south of the K\u00e1sarag\u00f3d taluk the unit is the 'pothipad,' the equivalent of a Mangalore mudi. In the north of K\u00e1sarag\u00f3d it is the 'Manj\u00e9shwar holike' of 39 (nominal) seers. In the north of the Udupi taluk the koilu, i.e., the extent one man can reap in a day, one-twelfths of an acre, is the rent unit. In the Coondapoor\n\n---\n\n1 District Manual, Volume I, page 215.\n2 Ibid, page 194.\ntaluk the 'stalu mudi' is about 20 seers, one-third of an acre. In all other parts the bijwari mudi means the Mangalore mudi of 42 seers.\n\nBefore the survey of the district it was thought (District Manual, Vol. I, page 215) that the bijwari 'mudi' was equivalent to one acre. It is not possible to ascertain the area by experiment, as each cultivator has his own ideas on sowing. The 'Mangalore' mudi is nominally a piece of land requiring 42 seers of seed. Assuming that an acre requires 60 seers (though some land-owners put it at 70 seers), a Mangalore mudi is seven-tenths of an acre.\n\nAn 'argile' mudi is nominally land requiring 56 seers of seed or fourteen-fifteenths of an acre.\n\nA comparison of leases and sale-deeds with survey areas, and personal field enquiries made from tenants, landlords and Government officials in all parts of the district brings out the fact that the amount of seed required to sow a field is invariably exaggerated by the land-owner, with a view to obtain a higher rent or price. The same custom prevails in the adjoining province of Coorg. There the produce of the land, and not the seed it requires, is the standard of measurement. A piece of land described by its owner as producing 100 batties in fact never produces more than 70 batties, often less. It is not to be supposed that the tenant or the purchaser is deceived by this, as it is a universal custom. It must, however, be allowed for in estimating the area in acres, of the 'bijwari mudi' of the leases and sale-deeds current among the people. In bail lands an average deduction of not less than 25 per cent. must be made from the nominal seed capacity of a field on this account. This figure has been arrived at by careful enquiries from all classes of people interested in land, and may be accepted as correct.\n\nThe Mangalore bijwari mudi in bail land is then $\\frac{3}{4}$ of an acre, and the argile mudi seven-tenths of an acre. It would be easy to cite cases in which the area was more and in which it was less than these figures. They represent a fair average. In bettus, more space is taken up by unprofitable areas, such as larger bunds and the terraces of cultivated land are smaller in proportion. It is, therefore, usually considered that a bettu field takes 48 seers for a Mangalore mudi of land, and 60 seers for an argile mudi. The Mangalore bettu bijwari mudi is therefore four-fifths of an acre, and the argile bettu mudi is one acre. The majal Mangalore bijwari mudi is about 40 seers capacity, or two-thirds of an acre; and the argile majal mudi is about 50 seers, or five-sixths of an acre.\n\nExcept in the case of permanent leases (m\u00falg\u00e9ni), competition rents are in force throughout the whole district. In the Coondapoor taluk, and the northern part of the Udipi taluk, rents are usually calculated in terms of the kanchina mudi of 63 seers. Elsewhere, unless some other standard (such as the K\u00e1rkala holike or\nManjeshwar holike) are specified, the rent mura is the Mangalore mura of 42 imperial seers.\n\nBail rents are nearly always in rice. Majal rents are generally in rice, sometimes partly in rice and partly in money. Bettu rents are paid in rice near the coast, and money or rice in the interior.\n\nThough there are in each taluk exceptional villages where rents are abnormally high or low, on the whole there is not much difference in rents throughout the district, when the actual money value is worked out according to the local measures. On the whole, rents for rice lands are lower and bagayat rents are higher in the south of Kasaragod taluk than elsewhere. It will, therefore, be sufficient to give the rents in the different parts of the Mangalore taluk.\n\nNear Mangalore town exceptionally good bail lands are rented for as much as fifteen muras of rice per argile mudi. Rent is usually paid partly in first-sort and partly in second-sort, but to avoid any over-estimation of rents it will be assumed here that all rents are paid in second-sort rice, and the low price of Rs. 3 per mudi will be taken when converting rents into money. Fifteen muras per argile mura are therefore equivalent to Rs. 64 per acre. The best majals, suited for growing sugarcane, in the same locality are rented at seven pagodas per argile mudi or Rs. 42 per acre. The best bettus are rented for five muras per argile mura or Rs. 15 per acre.\n\nThese rents are for exceptional lands. Ordinarily good bails in the special and first group are rented for twelve muras an'argile mudi or Rs. 51 per acre. Majals of the same quality are rented at from Rs. 25 to Rs. 30 per acre, i.e., six muras per argile mura; and bettus of the same quality in the same tract, four muras or Rs. 12 per acre.\n\nIn the eastern part of the first group and the second group good bails are rented at from 8 to 6 muras per Mangalore mudi or Rs. 45 to Rs. 34 per acre. Majals are rented at four or five muras per Mangalore mudi or Rs. 18 to Rs. 22 per acre; bettus from two to three muras or Rs. 7 to Rs. 11 per acre.\n\nIn the worst villages of the third group, situated in the malarious vicinity of the ghats, bail rents are as low as three to five muras per Mangalore mura, i.e., Rs. 17 to Rs. 27 an acre; majals at two to three muras or Rs. 9 to Rs. 13 per acre; and bettus one to two muras or Rs. 3 to Rs. 5 per acre.\n\nThe rents of bagayats are more difficult to ascertain. Ordinarily good coconut bagayats are rented at from Rs. 40 to Rs. 50 per acre. Exceptional coconut bagayats fetch as much as Rs. 90 per acre. Coconut trees planted on the bunds of paddy fields, when not planted by the tenant, fetch As. 4 to As. 8 per tree. There must be many cases where the rent of the trees standing on the bunds more than covers the wet assessment on the field.\nAreca gardens are seldom given on lease. When they are so given, the rents are as high as Rs. 200 an acre (paragraph 70 of Board's Proceedings No. 41, R.S., L.R. and Agri., dated 15th March 1902).\n\nThe eastern villages of the fourth group of the Uppinangadi taluk are the worst in the district. Bails here do not fetch more than Rs. 12 per acre, majals Rs. 6 to Rs. 8 and bettus Rs. 3 or Rs. 4. In these villages most of the land is cultivated by the land-owners themselves.\n\nThe above rents are given as a record of the state of things prevailing prior to the introduction of settlement. The highest rents absorb almost the whole of the first crop. The tenant must make his living and pay the expenses of cultivation from the second crop and the third wet or the grain crop, if any. Tenants in such tracts are, in fact, mere coolies, and eke out their living by other occupations. In such cases enhancement of rent is impossible. In general, however, the land-owning classes have everywhere raised their rents in proportion to the assessment. In some cases they have actually made a profit out of the settlement by raising their rents by the full amount of the settlement assessment, themselves gaining the benefit of the increment remission.\n\nIn paragraph 21 of G.O. No. 757, Revenue, dated 25th August 1902, it is stated that the settlement assessment on first and second class wet lands may be reckoned at one-quarter of the average rental. The figures given above show that, even before the rents were enhanced, this estimate was low, for first and second class lands alone. For the best bail and majals the maximum settlement assessment comes to about one-sixth of the rent, as fixed prior to settlement. Almost every patta, however, contains some dry land, or house-site for which no rent is paid. The proportion of the assessment to the rent is higher in the interior. Taking all these points into consideration, the settlement assessment may be said to range from one-fifth to one-quarter of the old rent in the special and first group villages, and from one-quarter to one-third in the interior. In a few villages at the foot of the gh\u00e2ts it is more than one-third. Rents have, however, been enhanced wherever it was possible to do so, subsequent to settlement; and before the full settlement assessment has been reached the landlords will be in receipt of much the same net income as before.\nXI.\u2014Classification of area and money rates according to the last settlement.\n\n(Part I.
