She lost the train, and started to walk home, carrying the aprons in a bundle and an umbrella. The night was very dark, snow was falling heavily, and the road was inches deep in slush. In a part of the road which was unfrequented, the prisoner seized her, threw her down in the roadway, saying that he was \"Jack the Ripper,\" and that he would let the wind into her throat with his knife. He also attempted to get the rings off her fingers, and otherwise grossly assaulted her. A lad coming up the prisoner desisted, when prosecutrix managed to get away, and found a policeman, K.R. 61. The officer went in the direction taken by the prisoner, and found him concealed up a court carrying the aprons under his left arm. His clothes were muddy and in disorder, and he had lost his cap. A cap such as that used by firemen was found near the scene of the assault. Mrs. Tilley, who was in a deplorable condition from fright, injuries, and cold, all her clothes being soaked through with mud and water, was taken home, and Dr. O'Brien certified that she was unable to leave her bed for several days. It transpired that the prisoner had only landed that day from one of the Cape steamers, on board of which he was employed. He told a long and rambling story in his defence, and totally denied the commission of the crime.\u2014The jury found him \"Guilty,\" and commended the promptitude shown by K.R. 61 in arresting him.\u2014The learned chairman said that, after having seen the demeanour of the prisoner in the dock, he should postpone sentence, in order that the medical officer of the gaol might have an opportunity of inquiring into the state of his mind.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3206275740.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 878, "total-output-tokens": 531, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 2138, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
