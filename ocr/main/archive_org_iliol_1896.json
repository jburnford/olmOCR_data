THE PRINCE OF WALES.\n\n1896.\n\nPrice Ten Shillings and Sixpence.\nPREFACE.\n\nWith the present edition of the India Office List there has been incorporated the Civil portion of the India List, and the publication will henceforth be styled The India List and India Office List. The publication of the India List as a separate work will be discontinued from the present date, and the information which it contained with regard to the Military Services in India will be found in the Indian Army List published quarterly by the Government of India, copies of which can be procured through the Official Agents in this country. As, however, the latter publication does not give the regulations regarding the Indian Staff Corps, Military Furlough, Family Pensions, &c., which found a place in the India List, these have been added to the present volume. For similar reasons the Lists of Officers of the Royal Indian Marine have also been included.\n\nIn making an extension of this work, the nominal lists of Civil Servants in the several Departments in India have been limited to those drawing not less than Rs. 500 a month substantive pay.\n\nThe Record of Services contains a brief statement of the services of each member of the India Office Establishment, of the covenanted Civil Service of India, and of the higher grades of other Government servants in civil employment in that country. This has been compiled mainly from the separate histories of services published under the direction of the supreme and local governments in India, supplemented by information received specially from the local governments in India, and, where possible, from private sources.\nOwing to considerations of space, it has been found necessary in the case of some classes of public servants to include only those who have reached a certain rank in the service, as indicated by their substantive rate of pay (see note, p. 351).\n\nA revised edition will be published about the beginning of each year, and the Registrar and Superintendent of Records will be glad to receive from those concerned early intimation of errors or omissions. Any communication which will entail alteration in the subsequent edition should reach the India Office before the 1st December.\n\nIndia Office,\n\nFebruary, 1896.\nCONTENTS.\n\nAbstract of Civil Service Regulations .................................................. 180\nAccounts Departments.

The Island was handed over to the Company on the 23rd Sept., 1668. For the next nineteen years (1668-1687), except for occasional visits, and during three years (1672-1675) of Governor Aungier\u2019s rule, the Governors of Bombay spent almost the whole of their time in Surat, or which factory they were presidents. During this time, Bombay was administered by an officer styled Deputy-Governor. The transfer, in 1687, of the headquarters of the Company\u2019s power to Bombay to a great extent did away with the need of a Deputy-Governor. But in spite of the change the title continued for many years to be borne by the second member of the Council. It would seem to have fallen into disuse some time between 1720 and 1738.\n\n(b) Child was Governor and General with his headquarters in Bombay, whither he moved from Surat on the 2nd May, 1687, and where he died on the 4th Feb., 1691. In the year 1684, Bombay was the scene of a revolt against the Company\u2019s authority. The head of the rebellion was Captain Richard Keigwin, the third member of the Council. Placing the Deputy-Governor under arrest, Keigwin ruled Bombay in the King\u2019s name from the 29th Dec., 1683, to the 19th Nov., 1684, when on promise of pardon he handed over the Island to Admiral Sir Thomas Grantham.\n### CHRONOLOGICAL LISTS OF GOVERNORS OF BOMBAY\u2014continued.\n\n| Names                  | Assumed charge of office | Remarks |\n|------------------------|--------------------------|---------|\n| Sir John Gayer (a)     | 17 May, 1694             |         |\n| Sir Nicholas Waite     | \u2014 Nov., 1704             |         |\n| William Aislabie       | \u2014 Sept., 1708            |         |\n| Stephen Strutt         | 11 Oct., 1715            | Officiating. |\n\n### PRESIDENTS AND GOVERNORS OF BOMBAY.\n\n| Names                  | Assumed charge of office | Remarks |\n|------------------------|--------------------------|---------|\n| Charles Boone          | 26 Dec., 1715            | On 11 March, 1715, the Court of Directors resolved to appoint a President for Bombay, and on the 16th idem Mr. Boone was nominated to that post. |\n| William Phipps         | 9 Jan., 1722             | Dismissed the service of government. |\n| Robert Cowan           | 10 Jan., 1729            |         |\n| John Horne             | 22 Sept., 1734           |         |\n| Stephen Law            | 7 April, 1739            |         |\n| John Geekie            | 15 Nov., 1742            | Officiating. |\n| William Wake           | 26 Nov., 1742            |         |\n| Richard Bourchier      | 17 Nov., 1750            |         |\n| Charles Crommelin      | 28 Feb., 1760            | Died, 23 February, 1771. |\n| Thomas Hodges          | 27 Jan., 1767            |         |\n| William Hornby         | 26 Feb., 1771            |         |\n| Rawson Hart Bodham     | 1 Jan., 1784             |         |\n\n### GOVERNORS OF BOMBAY\u2014continued.\n\n| Names                  | Assumed charge of office | Remarks |\n|------------------------|--------------------------|---------|\n| Rawson Hart Bodham     | 6 Jan., 1785             | Appointed 3 Sept., 1784, under the Act 24 Geo.

will be held in London, under the subjoined Regulations, commencing on the 3rd August, 1896.\n\nThe number of persons to be selected at this Examination will be announced hereafter.\n\nNo person will be admitted to compete from whom the Secretary, Civil Service Commission, has not received, on or before the 1st June, 1896, an application on the prescribed form, accompanied by a list of the subjects in which the Candidate desires to be examined.\n\nThe Order for admission to the Examination will be posted on the 21st July, 1896, to the address given on the Form of Application. It will contain instructions as to the time and place at which candidates will be required to attend, and as to the manner in which the fee (\u00a35) is to be paid.\n\nCivil Service Commission,\n\nOctober, 1895.\n\nREGULATIONS.\n\n** The following Regulations, made by the Secretary of State for India in Council, are liable to alteration from year to year.\n\n1. An Examination for admission to the Civil Service of India, open to all qualified persons, will be held in London in August of each year. The date of the Examination and the number of appointments to be made for each Province will be announced beforehand by the Civil Service Commissioners.\n\n2. No person will be deemed qualified who shall not satisfy the Civil Service Commissioners:\n\n(i.) That he is a natural-born subject of Her Majesty.\n\n(ii.) That his age will be above twenty-one years and under twenty-three years, on the first day of the year in which the Examination is to be held. [N.B.\u2014In the case of Na\u00efves of India, it will be necessary for a Candidate to obtain a certificate of age and nationality signed, should he be a resident in British India, by the Secretary to Government of the Province, or the Commissioner of the Division within which his family resides, or, should he reside in a native state, by the highest Political Officer accredited to the state in which his family resides.]\n\n(iii.) That he has no disease, constitutional affection, or bodily infirmity unfitting him, or likely to unfit him, for the Civil Service of India.\n\n(iv.) That he is of good moral character.\n\n3. Should the evidence upon the above points be prima facie satisfactory to the Civil Service Commissioners, the Candidate, on payment of the prescribed fee, will be admitted to the Examination. The Commissioners may, however, in their discretion, at any time prior to the grant of the Certificate of Qualification hereinafter referred to, institute such further inquiries as they may deem necessary; and if the result of such inquiries, in the case of any Candidate, should be unsatisfactory to them in any of the above respects, he will be ineligible for admission to the Civil Service of India, and, if already selected, will be removed from the position of a Probationer.\n\n4. The Open Competitive Examination will take place only in the following branches of knowledge:\n\n| Marks | Subject |\n|-------|---------|\n| 500   | English Composition |\n| 500   | Sanskrit Language and Literature |\n| 500   | Arabic ditto, ditto |\n| 750   | Greek ditto, ditto |\n| 750   | Latin ditto, ditto |\n| 500   | English Language and Literature (including special period named by the Commissioners) (a) |\n| 500   | French ditto, ditto |\n| 500   | German ditto, ditto |\n| 900   | Mathematics (pure and applied) |\n| 900   | Advanced Mathematical subjects (pure and applied) |\n| 900   | Natural Science, i.e., any number not exceeding three of the following subjects: |\n|       | Elementary Chemistry and Elementary Physics |\n|       | Higher Chemistry |\n|       | Higher Physics |\n|       | Geology |\n|       | Botany |\n|       | Zoology |\n|       | Animal Physiology |\n\n(a) In the syllabus referred to in Note (c), p. 166.\nREGULATIONS FOR ADMISSION\n\nGreek History (Ancient, including Constitution) ... ... ... 400\nRoman History (ditto, ditto) ... ... ... 400\nEnglish History ... ... ... 500\nGeneral Modern History (period to be selected by Candidates from list in the syllabus issued by the Commissioners, one period at least to include Indian History) (b) ... ... ... 500\nLogic and Mental Philosophy (Ancient and Modern) ... ... ... 400\nMoral Philosophy (Ancient and Modern) 400\nPolitical Economy and Economic History ... ... ... 500\nPolitical Science (including Analytical Jurisprudence, the Early History of Institutions, and Theory of Legislation) ... ... ... 500\nRoman Law ... ... ... 500\nEnglish Law.

No subjects are obligatory.\n\n5. The merit of the persons examined will be estimated by marks; and the number set opposite to each branch in the preceding regulation denotes the greatest number of marks that can be obtained in respect of it.\n\n6. The marks assigned to Candidates in each branch will be subject to such deduction as the Civil Service Commissioners may deem necessary in order to secure that \"a Candidate be allowed no credit at all for taking up a subject in which he is a mere smatterer.\"\n\n7. The Examination will be conducted on paper and viv\u0101 voce, as may be deemed necessary.\n\n8. The marks obtained by each Candidate, in respect of each of the subjects in which he shall have been examined, will be added up, and the names of the several Candidates who shall have obtained, after the deduction above-mentioned, a greater aggregate number of marks than any of the remaining Candidates, will be set forth in order of merit, and such Candidates shall be deemed to be selected Candidates for the Civil Service of India, provided they appear to be in other respects duly qualified. Should any of the selected Candidates become disqualified, the Secretary of State for India will determine whether the vacancy thus created shall be filled up or not. In the former case the Candidate next in order of merit, and in other respects duly qualified, shall be deemed to be a selected Candidate. A Candidate entitled to be deemed a selected Candidate, but declining to accept the nomination as such, which may be offered to him, will be disqualified for any subsequent competition.\n\n9. Selected Candidates before proceeding to India will be on probation for one year, at the end of which time they will be examined, with a view of testing their progress in the following subjects (d):\n\nCompulsory\u2014\n\n1.

Chinese (for Candidates assigned to the province of Burma only) 400\n\nIn this Examination, as in the open competition, the merit of the Candidates examined will be estimated by marks (which will be subject to deductions in the same way as the marks assigned at the open competition), and the number set opposite to each subject denotes the greatest number of marks that can be obtained in respect of it. The Examination will be conducted on paper and viv\u0101 voce, as may be deemed necessary. This Examination will be held at the close of the year of probation, and will be called the \"Final Examination.\"\n\n10. The selected Candidates will also be tested during their probation as to their proficiency in riding.\n\nThe Examinations in riding will be held as follows:\u2014\n\n(1.) Shortly after the result of the Open Competitive Examination has been declared, or at such time or times as the Commissioners may appoint during the course of the probationary year.\n\n(2.) Again, at the time of the Final Examination, Candidates who may fully satisfy the Commissioners of their ability to ride well, and to perform journeys on horseback, shall receive a certificate which shall entitle them to be credited with 200 or 100 marks according to the degree of proficiency displayed to be added to their marks in the Final Examination.\n\n(b) See Note (c).\n\n(c) A syllabus, defining in general terms the character of the Examination in the various subjects, may be obtained on application to the Secretary, Civil Service Commission (reprinted on page 166.)\n\n(d) Instructions, showing the extent of the examination, will be issued to the successful Candidates as soon as possible after the result of the open competition is declared.\n\n* These subjects may not be offered by any Candidate who has offered them at the open competition.\n(3.) Candidates who fail to obtain this certificate, but who gain a certificate of minimum proficiency in riding, will be allowed to proceed to India, but will be subjected, on their arrival, to such further tests in riding as may be prescribed by their Government, and shall receive no increase to their initial salary until they have passed such tests to the satisfaction of that Government. A Candidate who fails, at the end of the year of probation, to gain at least the certificate of minimum proficiency in riding, will be liable to have his name removed from the list of selected Candidates.\n\n11. The selected Candidates who, at the Final Examination, shall be found to have a competent knowledge of the subjects specified in Regulation 9, and who shall have satisfied the Civil Service Commissioners of their eligibility in respect of nationality, age, health, character and ability to ride, shall be certified by the said Commissioners to be entitled to be appointed to the Civil Service of India, provided they shall comply with the regulations in force, at the time, for that Service.\n\n12. Persons desirous to be admitted as Candidates, must apply on Forms, which may be obtained from \"The Secretary, Civil Service Commission, London, S.W.,\" at any time after the 1st December in the year previous to that in which the Examination is to be held. The Forms must be returned so as to be received at the office of the Civil Service Commissioners on or before 31st May (or, if that date should fall upon a Sunday or public holiday, then, on or before the first day thereafter on which their office is open), in the year in which the Examination is to be held.\n\nThe Civil Service Commissioners are authorized by the Secretary of State for India in Council to make the following announcements:\n\n(1.) Selected Candidates will be allotted to the various provinces upon a consideration of all the circumstances, including their own wishes; but the requirements of the Public Service will rank before every other consideration.\n\n(2.) An allowance amounting to \u00a3100 will be given to all Candidates who pass their probation at one of the Universities or Colleges which have been approved by the Secretary of State, viz., the Universities of Oxford, Cambridge, Dublin, Glasgow, Edinburgh, St. Andrew's, and Aberdeen; Victoria College, Manchester; University College, London; and King's College, London; provided such Candidates shall have passed the Final Examination to the satisfaction of the Civil Service Commissioners, and shall have conducted themselves well and complied with such rules as may be laid down for the guidance of Selected Candidates. The whole probation must ordinarily be passed at the same Institution. Migration will not be permitted, except for special reasons, approved by the Secretary of State.\n\n(3.) The allowance of \u00a3100 will not be paid to any Selected Candidate until he has been certified by the Civil Service Commissioners to be entitled to be appointed to the Civil Service of India; and every Certificated Candidate must, before receiving his allowance, give a written undertaking to refund the amount in the event of his failing to proceed to India.\n\n(4.) All Candidates obtaining Certificates will be also required to enter into covenants, by which, amongst other things, they will bind themselves to make such payments as, under the Rules and Regulations for the time being in force, they may be required to make towards their own pensions, or for the pensions of their families.

Candidates will also be expected to show that they have studied in these authors the history of the English language in respect of its vocabulary, syntax, and prosody.\n\nThe other part of the Examination will relate to one of the periods named below, which will follow each other year by year in the order indicated.\n\n| Period | Year |\n|--------|------|\n| 1      | 1360-1600 |\n|        | [Chaucer to Spenser] |\n| 2      | 1600-1700 |\n|        | [Shakespeare to Dryden] |\n| 3      | 1700-1800 |\n|        | [Pope to Cowper] |\n| 4      | 1800-1832 |\n|        | [Nineteenth Century writers to the death of Scott] |\n\nThe Examination in this part will require from Candidates a more minute acquaintance with the history of the English language and literature, as illustrated in the chief works produced in each period, and will be based to a considerable extent, but by no means exclusively, on certain books specified each year by the Commissioners.* The names placed under the dates are intended to suggest the general character of the literary development of the period, and consequently the natural limits of the examination. All the works of Shakespeare, for example, will be regarded as falling within the period 1600 to 1700; all the works of Swift within the period 1700 to 1800; all the works of Scott and Wordsworth, and all the works of Macaulay, within the period 1800 to 1832.\n\nFrench Language and Literature.\u2014Translation from French into English, and from English into French; Critical questions on the French Language and Literature.\n\nGerman Language and Literature.\u2014As in French.\n\nLatin Language and Literature.\u2014Translation from Latin into English.

The Examination, which will be conducted by the Civil Service Commissioners, will be simultaneous with, and in the same subjects and papers as, the Examination for the Indian Forest Department,* which is usually held in June. [But see Clause VI, Class I. Obligatory Subjects 3.]\n\nCandidates may undergo the written part of their Examination in London, Edinburgh, or Dublin, or at any of the provincial centres at which the simultaneous Examination of candidates for admission to the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, is to be held. A list of the probable centres may be obtained from the Civil Service Commissioners at any time after March 1896. The oral and practical parts of the Examination will be held in London only.\n\nA fee of \u00a32 is required from candidates examined in London, but when the written Examination is conducted elsewhere than in London the fee is \u00a33. Candidates examined at a college or school will probably be required to pay a local fee (in order to defray the expenses of superintendence), as to which they should obtain early information from the college or school authorities. The fee payable to the Civil Service Commissioners must be paid by means of stamps of the specified amount. Instructions on this point will be issued to candidates about ten days before the Examination.\n\nII. The number of candidates to be selected\nwill be 7, viz., for Madras 3, Bengal 2, North-West Provinces and Oudh 1, and Bombay 1.\n\nIII. Candidates must be British-born or naturalized British subjects. They must be above nineteen and under twenty-one years of age, on the 1st June, 1896.

A weak constitution.\n2. Defective vision.\n3. Impaired hearing.\n4. The existence of any congenital defect.\n\nIt is to be understood that this private examination is merely suggested to lessen the chances of disappointment, and that it is by no means intended to take the place of, or to influence in any way, the official examination.\n\nOn the subject of the eyesight required for the Indian Services, a pamphlet has been published, under the authority of the Secretary of State in Council by Messrs.

Selected candidates who have successfully passed the above-mentioned tests will be allotted, as probationers, to the various provinces upon a consideration of all the circumstances, including their own wishes; but the requirements of the public service will rank before every other consideration. The allotment will also be subject to the right of the Government of India to make transfers, if necessary.\n\nX. The probationers will be required to start for India not later than October, 1896, so as to arrive in the course of November. Failure to embark in time will, in the absence of satisfactory explanation, lead to forfeiture of appointment. Free passages to India will be provided by the India Office.\n\nXI.

Passages from English authors will be given for translation into Latin prose and verse, but candidates will be allowed, in the place of verse composition, to answer questions of a simple character, which will test whether they possess a fundamental knowledge of the grammar of the language, and such an elementary acquaintance with Roman History, as is required for the intelligent study of the books they have read.\n\nGreek.\u2014Passages will be set for translation into English from the authors usually read in schools, and in other respects the Examination will proceed on the same lines as in Latin.\n\nEnglish History.\u2014The General Paper in this subject will test whether the candidates are accurately acquainted with the facts of English History, and also possess an intelligent knowledge of the meaning of the facts. The paper on the fixed period will, of course, require from the candidates more minute knowledge than the General Paper.\n\nBotany, Chemistry, Physics, Physical Geography, and Geology.\u2014The standard of Examination in these subjects will be such as may be reasonably expected from the education given at Schools possessing appliances for practical instruction, such as a Laboratory, &c. A considerable portion of the marks will be allotted for the proficiency shown in the practical part of the Examination.\n\nChemistry will be limited to elements of Inorganic Chemistry.\n\nPhysics will include elementary properties of Electricity, Magnetism, Heat, Light, and Sound.\n\nGeology, chiefly economic, including the recognition of the more familiar Minerals and Rocks, and their

State.\n\n1. The Royal Indian Engineering College is primarily maintained under the orders of the Secretary of State for India in Council, in view to the education of candidates for the service of Government in the India Public Works, Telegraph, and Forest Departments; but it is open, to the extent of the accommodation available, to all persons desirous of following the course of study pursued in it.\n\n2. Candidates for the India Forest Department are selected under special arrangements (paras. 37 and 38).\n\n3. Nominations to the India Telegraph Department are made from among the Engineer students at the College, at the end of their first year of study (paras. 34, 35, 36).\n\n4. About fifty Engineer students are admitted yearly to the College. Candidates for admission must be between the ages of seventeen and twenty-one years on the 1st day of July of the year of admission, and of good moral character; they must have received a good general education, and have attained to a sufficient degree of proficiency in elementary mathematics to enable them to follow the College course with advantage.* These limits of age do not apply to students who are not candidates for Government appointments.\n\n5. In the event of there being more qualified candidates for admission than the College can receive, the preference will be given according to dates of application for admission.\n\n6. The collegiate year usually begins in the latter part of September. Applications for admission as Engineer students may be made at any time, but not later than the 15th day of June of the year named for admission, except with the special permission of the President.\n\n7. In every case applications for admission must be made on the prescribed forms, which can be obtained from the Secretary to the College.\n\n8. Candidates whose applications are found satisfactory as to age and character will be required to undergo an examination, to be held at the College, about the last week in June of the year for admission.\n\n9. A fee of \u00a32 will be payable in advance by each candidate accepted for examination. It will be called for early in May.\n\n10. The examination will be in the undermentioned subjects:\n\n(a.) English Composition, to the extent of being able to write grammatically, and with correct spelling, in a neat and legible hand.\n\n(b.) Mathematics as under, viz.:\n\nArithmetic.\n\nElementary Algebra, including Quadratic Equations, Arithmetical and Geometrical series, Ratio, Proportion and Variation, Surds and Indices, and the Binomial Theorem.\n\nGeometry. The first four and sixth books of Euclid, with easy riders.\n\nMensuration.\u2020\n\nElementary Plane Trigonometry\u2021, including Identities; formulae relating to the sum and difference, and the multiplication and division of Angles; Equations; properties and solution of Triangles, and use of Logarithms.\u00a7\n\nSee also footnote.*\n\n11. Candidates will also be required to give evidence of having received a fair general education, by undergoing an examination in some classical or modern language, as well as in history or geography.\n\n12. The President may dispense with the whole or any portion of this examination in the case of a candidate who produces an University Diploma, or other similar certificate granted by a recognised examining body. In all such cases, however, the entrance fee of \u00a32 will be payable.\n\n13. The College course in both Engineering and Forestry extends over three years, that in Telegraphy (para. 35) over two years. The appointments to the Indian services offered by the Secretary of State for India are awarded on the completion of each course to duly qualified successful candidates, subject to the conditions as to physical fitness described in para. 25.\n\n14. Each annual session begins in September, and is divided into three terms, with vacations of about four weeks at Christmas, two weeks at Easter, and eight weeks in the Summer.\n\n15. An annual charge of \u00a3183|| is made for each student, which must be paid in advance to the Bank of England, in three sums of \u00a361 per term. Receivable orders with full directions as to the mode of payment will be forwarded from the India Office to the parents or guardians shortly thereafter.\n\n---\n\n* Specimens of the Entrance Examination Papers, the pay and the leave and pension rules up to the latest date received, full details regarding the course of study and distribution of marks, the class and prize lists, &c., &c., will be found in the official College Calendar, published by Messrs. W. H. Allen & Co., 13, Waterloo Place, S.W., Price Six Shillings.\n\n\u2020 Lodge's Mensuration (Longmans) is recommended, Chapters I, III, VI (Arts. 112, 120, 124, 125), VIII & IX.\n\n\u2021 To the extent, for example, of Todhunter's Trigonometry for Beginners. Importance will be attached to arithmetical accuracy both in Mensuration and in Trigonometry.\n\n\u00a7 Bremiker's Logarithms (with Appendix) are used at the College (D. Nutt & Co., 270, Strand).\n\n|| Except in the case of Forest students, whose fees are given on p. 176.\nbefore the fees fall due. A student will not be admitted into residence until his fee has been paid.\n\n16. A deposit of \u00a35 is required from each student on admission to the College, as caution money, to cover charges incurred by him for damage to books, instruments, &c., or any College bills outstanding on leaving the College. When these have been defrayed, the balance standing at his credit will be repaid. This deposit is to be paid with the fee for the first term, making the total payment on that occasion \u00a366.\n\n17. The College fees include all charges for tuition, board, according to the College tariff, and lodging, with washing, to the extent of 2s. weekly, and for ordinary medical attendance. Students are required to provide their own class books and drawing instruments. Drawing paper, drawing boards, and surveying instruments are provided by the College.\n\n18. The subjects of study at the College are:\n\n- Descriptive Engineering.\n- Surveying.\n- Architecture.\n- Geometrical Drawing.\n- Estimating and Accounts.\n- Exercises in Design.\n- Workshop Practice.\n- Mechanical Laboratory.\n- Applied Mechanics.\n- Pure and Applied Mathematics.\n- *Chemistry (Theoretical and Practical).\n- *Physics (Mathematical and Practical).\n- Geology and Mineralogy.\n- *French.\n- *German.\n- *Freehand Drawing.\n- Chemistry of Soils and Vegetation\n- Botany\n- Entomology\n- Forestry\n\nFor Forest Students only.\n\n- Telegraph Construction\n- Telegraph Signalling\n\nFor Telegraph Students only.\n\n19. The proficiency of the students in the studies pursued is tested by periodical examinations, and by assigning values to the drawings, surveys, notes, reports, &c., executed by them while at the College.\n\n20. The subjects enumerated in para. 18 are grouped in certain main branches of study, and a fixed minimum of qualification is required in each branch, as well as a certain minimum of average proficiency in all the branches taken together, as tested by the aggregate marks gained, in order to obtain the ordinary College diploma (see para. 22). But Engineer students are encouraged to pursue more particularly those branches of study beyond the limits of the obligatory course for which they may show special aptitude. Superior attainments will be recognised by special diplomas (see para. 22.)\n\n21. A final examination will be held during the last year of the course, with the assistance of special examiners not connected with the College. This final examination, in addition to paper work will embrace exercises in surveying, drawing, designing, and estimating, which will occupy some weeks in execution.\n\n22. Engineer students, not exceeding three in number, and Forest students, not exceeding two in number, in any year, who pass out of the College with special distinction, may be appointed 'Honorary Fellows of Cooper's Hill.' The Diploma of 'Associate' will be granted to all others who pass out in the first class in one at least of the branches mentioned in para. 20. All others who come up to the prescribed standard of qualification will receive the ordinary diploma of the College.\n\n23. Every student will be required to conform to the College rules, to exhibit due diligence in his studies throughout the course, and to give evidence of satisfactory progress at the different examinations; failing which, or in the event of serious personal misconduct, he will not be allowed to remain at the College.\n\nIndian Public Works Appointments.\n\n24. The Secretary of State for India offers annually a number of appointments in the Indian Public Works Department for competition among the students of the College. If possible, the precise number will be notified four years beforehand, that is about a year before the students concerned enter the College.\n\n25. Those students who have reached the prescribed standard of qualification, being British subjects, of sound constitution, and free from any serious physical defects\u2020 which would render them unfit for employment in the Public Works Department of India (the final decision on which point will rest with the Secretary of State for India), will be eligible for these appointments in their order of standing after the final examination.\n\n26. The passed students thus selected will be appointed Assistant Engineers, Third Grade, at Rs. 350 per mensem, from the 1st October in the year of their passing out of the College, from which date also their service for pension will count. They will be provided with free passages to India, either on leaving the College or after the completion of a course of practical engineering in England, as may be arranged. (See para. 29.)\n\n27. They will be allowed before leaving for India to choose the province and branch of the profession in which they desire to be first employed, according to their position on the list and within the limit of the available vacancies in the different branches, on the understanding, however, that they will be at all times liable to\n\n* These subjects are, some wholly, some partially, alternative.\n\n\u2020 The number of appointments in the Indian Public Works Department offered by the Secretary of State for India to the students who enter the College in 1896 is 12.\n\n\u2021 On the subject of the standard of eyesight required for the Indian Public Works and Telegraph Departments, a pamphlet has been published under the authority of the Secretary of State in Council by Messrs. Churchill and Sons, 11, New Burlington Street, to which attention is specially drawn, since it is important that candidates shall place themselves in full possession of information regarding the tests that will be applied.\ntransfer from one province or branch to another at the pleasure of the Government of India, and according to the exigencies of the public service.\n\n28. Certain prescribed departmental and language examinations have to be passed in India, according to the regulations of the service, as a necessary condition for obtaining promotion to a higher grade.\n\n29. Every Assistant Engineer may be required to go through a course of practical engineering, under a civil or mechanical engineer, before proceeding to India. While so employed he will receive pay at the rate of \u00a3150 a year, to commence from the date of entering on the practical course, and in addition will be eligible to receive a premium of from \u00a310 to \u00a325 in each half-year during the course, according to the degree of proficiency and diligence shown. The practical course will commonly last for a year, at the expiration of which the Assistant Engineer, if reported qualified, will be provided with a free passage to India, and will be entitled to receive his salary at the Indian rate, which is at present Rs. 4,200 per annum, from the date of embarkation.\n\n30. The fees to the Engineers under whom the practical course is passed will be paid by the Secretary of State for India. But if the Assistant Engineer voluntarily relinquishes his appointment they will have to be refunded.\n\n31. An Assistant Engineer not making a sufficiently good use of the time passed on the practical course may be required to go through a further course, without pay, before proceeding to India, or in extreme cases his appointment may be cancelled.\n\n32. The time spent on the practical course will count as service towards pension.\n\n33. If the practical course in England should be dispensed with, the young Engineers will proceed direct to India, and their salaries, at Indian rates, will commence from the date of embarkation.\n\nIndian Telegraph Appointments.\n\n34. Nominations to the Indian Telegraph Department will also be made from the College, previous notice of the number available being given by advertisement as early as practicable.* Students, being British subjects, who hold a good place in Branch III (Mathematics), and are considered fit for employment in the Indian Telegraph Department under the general conditions stated in para. 25, will be eligible for these appointments to the extent of the available vacancies, in their order of standing on the order of merit list at the end of the first year's course.\n\n35. The students thus selected will go through a second year's course of special training at the College, on the satisfactory completion of which they will be appointed to the public service as Assistant Superintendents, Telegraph Department, the commencing salary of which grade is at present Rs. 3,600 a year, with effect from the 1st October in the year of their passing out of the College, from which date also their services for pension will count. They will be provided with free passages to India, and their salaries will commence from the date of embarkation.\n\n36. A student selected for the Indian Telegraph Department under para. 34, who during his year's course of special training does not attain to the prescribed standard of qualification, will be liable to have his appointment cancelled.\n\nIndian Forest Appointments.\n\n37. The candidates selected by the Secretary of State for India for the Indian Forest Department are received into the College for about three years' instruction, and are required to conform to its rules.\n\n38. The method of selection, which is different from that adopted in the case of the Public Works and Telegraph Department candidates, is explained in the Indian Forest Service Prospectus, given below.\n\nGeneral Rules.\n\n39. The College authorities, on application from students, will endeavour to arrange for placing those who pass out of the College with a diploma, but do not enter the Indian service, as pupils for one or two years with Civil or Mechanical Engineers of standing, at moderate rates of premium, payable by the students.\n\n40. Chemical, physical, botanical, and mechanical laboratories, a library, gymnasium, and workshops provided with steam and gas power machinery and electric light are attached to the College. Means are also provided for the practice of photography. Students making use of the laboratories are supplied with the needful apparatus. They are required to provide their own hand tools in the workshop.\n\n41. The responsibility for the discipline and management of the College and for the superintendence of the studies is vested in the President, under the general control of the Secretary of State for India.\n\n42. The students are distributed in divisions, under personal charge of one of the Professors or Instructors selected as tutor by the President, to whom the tutor is responsible for exercising the proper degree of personal supervision over each student in his division, and for conducting necessary correspondence with the student's parents or guardians.\n\n43. Each student is provided with a separate room, and with fuel and light, also with the necessary attendance. Furniture and bedding are supplied by the College, but each student is required to provide his own towels and bed linen. Meals are taken in hall. Wine and beer are not included in the ordinary fare, but can be obtained from the College cellar at fixed prices,\n\n* The number of appointments in the Indian Telegraph Department offered by the Secretary of State for India to the Students who enter the College in 1856 is 3.\n44. A chapel is attached to the College, which the students are expected to attend, unless specially exempted.\n\n45. Every student will be required to go through a course of gymnastics and also of military exercises, including the use of the rifle.\n\n46. Students are required to wear academical dress under such regulations as may be prescribed from time to time.\n\n47. Every student selected for any of the Indian Services is required, before proceeding to India, to furnish to the President satisfactory evidence of his competency in riding.\n\n---\n\n**INDIA FOREST DEPARTMENT APPOINTMENTS.**\n\n*(Prospectus referred to in para. 38 above.)*\n\n2. The Examination which is conducted by the Civil Service Commissioners usually takes place towards the end of June; and candidates may undergo the written part of their Examination in London, Edinburgh, or Dublin, or at any of the provincial centres at which the simultaneous Examination of candidates for admission to the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, is to be held. A list of the probable centres may be obtained from the Civil Service Commissioners at any time after March, 1896. The oral and practical parts of the Examination will be held in London only.\n\nA fee of \u00a32 is required from candidates examined in London, but when the written examination is conducted elsewhere than in London the fee is \u00a33. Candidates examined at a college or school will probably be required to pay a local fee in addition to the fee of \u00a33 (in order to defray the expenses of superintendence), as to which they should obtain early information from the college or school authorities. The fee payable to the Civil Service Commissioners must be paid by means of stamps of the specified amount. Instructions on this point will be issued to candidates about ten days before the Examination.\n\n3. The number of candidates to be selected annually varies according to the requirements of the Forest Service in India: the figures as regards each particular year will be advertised from time to time. In 1896 there will be 6 appointments offered for competition. It is possible that after 1896 recruits for the Indian Forest Service will be selected from Cooper's Hill College Students at the end of their first year's course of study.\n\n4. Candidates for the Indian Forest Department are selected under the following arrangements:\n\n(a.) An applicant must be a natural-born British subject, and must be above 17 and under 20 years of age on the 1st of June of the year in which he competes for an appointment. He must be unmarried, and if he marries before reaching India, he will forfeit his appointment.\n\n(b.) An applicant must send* to the Revenue Department of the India Office, on or before the 15th day of May of the year in which he proposes to compete:\n\n(1.) His name and parentage, a certificate, or other satisfactory evidence, of the date of his birth, and the written consent of parent or guardian, that his name should be recorded as a candidate.\n\n(2.) A statement of the places of education at which he may have been, accompanied by testimonials of good conduct, during the last four years.\n\n(c.) Applicants will have to appear before a Medical Board\u2020 at the India Office, particular stress being laid upon good vision and hearing. A physical test will also be imposed, so as to ensure the selection of persons of active habits and powers of endurance.\n\n(d.) The applicants who have successfully passed the medical examination and the physical test will be required to undergo an examination before the Civil Service Commissioners in the following subjects\u2021 (Classes I to III), marks being assigned as follows:\n\nenclosed in a covering letter, addressed to the Secretary, Revenue Department, India Office, London.\n\n\u2020 With a view to prevent parents and guardians from incurring the inconvenience and expense of preparing candidates who may be physically unfit for the Forest Service, it is suggested that, before any such preparation is begun, candidates be submitted to examination by the medical adviser of the family, or any other qualified medical practitioner, with regard to the following points:\n\n1. A weak constitution.\n2. Defective vision.\n3. Impaired hearing.\n4. The existence of any congenital defect.\n\nIt is to be understood that this private examination is merely suggested to lessen the chances of disappointment, and that it is by no means intended to take the place of, or to influence in any way, the official examination. On the subject of the standard of eyesight required for the Indian Services, a pamphlet has been published, under the authority of the Secretary of State in Council, by Messrs. Churchill & Sons, 11, New Burlington Street.\n\n\u2021 Reprints of the papers set at previous examinations, together with tables of the marks assigned to the candidates, are published by the Civil Service Commissioners, and can be obtained through any bookseller. The price of each reprint is One Shilling.\nClass I.\u2014Obligatory Subjects.*\n\n1. Mathematics (lower), viz., Algebra up to and including the Binomial Theorem; the theory and the use of Logarithms; Euclid, Books I to IV and VI; Plane Trigonometry up to and including the solution of Triangles and Mensuration ... 2,500\n\n2. English Composition ... 1,000\n\n3. German (400 for colloquial) ... 2,000\n\nClass II.\u2014Optional Subjects.*\n\n4.

Freehand Drawing ... 500\n\n14. Geometrical Drawing ... 300\n\nEither or both of these subjects may be taken in addition to the obligatory and the two optional subjects.\n\n(e.) The Secretary of State will nominate as probationers such competitors as attain the highest aggregate of marks (provided they obtain the minimum in the obligatory subjects and satisfy the requisite conditions in other respects). These probationers will then enter the College, where they will be further trained for the Forest Service of India.\n\n(f.) If the full number of competent probationers required in any year cannot be obtained from the persons so examined the Secretary of State reserves a discretion to fill up the deficiency by selecting any other person or persons who may satisfy the authorities of the College that he or they are properly qualified to become probationers for the Forest Service.\n\n5. The course of study for candidates for the India Forest Service extends over about three years, divided into seven terms, and a period of study in foreign forests. During seven terms, the Candidates will prosecute their studies mainly at the College, and, during the period of foreign study, which may last for five or six months, they will visit, under suitable supervision, such Continental forests as may be selected for the purpose. Excursions may also be made for purposes of instruction, both during term time and during part of the vacations.\n\n6. Each annual session begins in September, and is divided into three terms, with vacations of about four weeks at Christmas, two weeks at Easter, and eight weeks in the summer, except at the end of the visit to the Continent, when the vacation will be shorter.\n\n7. A charge of \u00a361 is made for each of the seven terms spent at the College; for the period of foreign study the charge is \u00a3150 for each student; the amounts must be paid terminally in advance to the Bank of England for the first seven terms, and the amount due for the period of foreign study must be paid before the period begins. Receivable orders, with full directions as to the mode of payment, will be forwarded from the India Office to the parents or guardians shortly before the fees fall due. A student will not be allowed to come into residence or to start for his foreign study of forests until his fee has been paid.\n\n8. A deposit of \u00a35 is required to be paid by each student on admission to the College, as caution money, to cover charges incurred by him for damage to books, instruments, &c., or any College bills outstanding on leaving the College. Any balance over and above such charges will be repaid. This deposit is to be paid with the fee for the first term, making the total payment on that occasion \u00a366.\n\n9. The foregoing payments cover all charges for tuition, board according to the College tariff, lodging, with washing, up to a cost of 2s. a week, and ordinary medical attendance.\nwhile in residence at the College. When students are on tour, and during the course of practical instruction, whether in Great Britain or on the Continent, the Secretary of State will defray the expenses of (1) board, lodging, and washing (the aggregate maximum expenditure on such account being 10s. per diem), (2) travelling expenses, and (3) fees to local Forest officers, &c.\n\nStudents are required to provide their own class books and drawing instruments. Drawing paper, drawing boards, and surveying instruments are provided by the College.\n\n10. The prescribed course of study comprises the following subjects:\u2014\n\nI.\u2014Auxiliary Subjects.\n1. Geometrical Drawing.\n2. Freehand Drawing.\n3. Surveying.\n4. Forest Engineering.\n5. Accounts.\n6. German.\n7. Mechanics.\n8. Physics.\n9. Chemistry.\n10. Geology and Mineralogy.\n11. Entomology.\n12. Botany.\n13. Drill and Gymnastics.\n\nII.\u2014Forestry, Theoretical and Practical, in all its branches.\n\n11. Every student is required to conform to the College rules, to exhibit due diligence in his studies throughout the course, and to give evidence of satisfactory progress in such manner as may be required, failing which, or in the event of serious misconduct, he will be liable to be removed from the College, or to be sent back from the foreign study, which may entail the loss of his appointment.\n\n12. During the course of study, the proficiency of the students will be tested by periodical examinations, and on the termination of their studies there will be a final examination. Each student may also, at the discretion of the Secretary of State for India, be required to appear before the Medical Board at the expiration of the first year of residence at the College, and should the result be unsatisfactory he cannot claim to be allowed to complete the course.\n\n13. The subjects enumerated in paragraph 10 are grouped in certain main branches of study,* and a fixed minimum of qualification is required in each branch, and in the subjects taught during the forest tours, as well as a certain minimum for all branches taken together. Students who obtain these minima will receive the College diploma in forestry.\n\n14. Candidates who have obtained this diploma, and are found to be of sound constitution and free from physical defects which would render them unsuitable for employment in the Forest Department (the final decision on which points will rest with the Secretary of State for India), will be appointed Assistant Conservators in the Forest Department of India in the order of their standing at the end of the final examination. They will be allowed before leaving the College to state their preference in respect to the provinces to which they desire to be allotted; but the distribution will be made to the several provinces, according to the needs of the public service at the discretion of the Secretary of State for India, after consulting the President of the College, and the Principal Professor of Forestry. The distribution will be made on the understanding that officers are at all times liable to be transferred from one province to another at the pleasure of the Government of India.\n\n15. Within a month of his nomination as Assistant Conservator, each nominee must sign articles of agreement describing the terms and conditions of his appointment; he must embark for India when required to do so by the Secretary of State, and will be provided with a free passage. Failure to embark at the stated time will, in the absence of satisfactory explanation, lead to forfeiture of appointment.\n\n16. The pay of an Assistant Conservator of Forests will begin from the date of reporting arrival in India. Probationers who acquit themselves creditably during their course at Cooper's Hill College will begin on a salary of Rs. 350 a month. It will, however, rest with the President of the College, in consultation with the Principal Professor of Forestry, to decide whether any of the probationers, though they have obtained the College diploma in Forestry, have failed to deserve that rate of initial salary. Such probationers, if any, will begin on a salary of Rs. 250 a month; and this difference of salary will continue until the first Departmental Examination is passed in India.\n\n17. Promotion, leave, and pension will be regulated by the rules of the Service for the time being. The more favourable pension rules have recently been extended to Forest Officers appointed from England, who are thus placed on an equality with Public Works Officers appointed from Cooper's Hill College. Any Forest Officer who has rendered not less than three years' approved service as head of his department, has also been made eligible for an extra pension of Rs. 1,000 per annum. A copy of the Regulations relative to these matters can be seen on application either at the Library, or the Record Department of the India Office; the principal rules, however, are contained in the Abstract of the Civil Service Regulations given in the following pages.\n\n18. Every candidate before proceeding to India, will be required to furnish to the President of the College satisfactory evidence of his competency in riding.\n\n* For details see Royal Indian Engineering College Calendar (p. 172, note).\n\nParagraphs 19 to 25 contain the \"General Rules\" already given on page 174.\nStudents not nominated for the Indian Forest Service, but desirous of obtaining a Diploma in Forestry from Cooper's Hill College.\n\n26. Students not nominated for the Indian Forest Service may be received into the College, as far as the available accommodation permits. Such students may pass through the course of instruction prescribed for the nominees of the Indian Forest Service, as detailed above, or they may be permitted to participate in the instruction given in certain subjects only. On attaining the prescribed minima of marks in the several branches of study and in totals as laid down above, they will receive, as the case may require, either the College Diploma in Forestry or special certificates showing in what subjects they have followed the instruction, and with what result.\n\n27. Candidates who desire to be admitted under para. 26 may submit the necessary application at any time, but not later than the 15th day of June of the year named for admission, except with the special permission of the President. The application must be made on the prescribed forms, which can be obtained from the Secretary to the College.\n\n28. Candidates whose applications are found satisfactory as to character and in other respects will be required to undergo an Examination, to be held at the College, about the last week in June of the year for admission. The object of the Examination will be to ascertain whether the candidate is qualified to follow the course of instruction with advantage (or certain parts of it, as the case may be). Candidates who do not come up to the required standard will not be admitted to the College.\n\nThe President may dispense with the whole or any portion of this Examination in the case of a candidate who produces an University diploma, or other similar certificate granted by a recognized examining body.\n\n29. Candidates admitted to the College under para. 26, who propose to pass through the full prescribed course of study, will be required to pay the same fees in every respect as those paid by the nominees for the India Forest Service. Candidates who do not become resident, and are admitted only to certain subjects of study, will be required to pay the fees which may be fixed in each special case in consideration of the extent of their studies. The candidates of both classes will be required to abide by the general rules of the College.\n\nSYLLABUS\n\nSHOWING THE EXTENT AND CHARACTER OF THE FOREST EXAMINATION.\n\nIn a letter addressed to the Civil Service Commissioners on the subject of the Examinations for admission into the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, the Director-General of military education, observes:\u2014\"The main object to be borne in mind with reference to the Entrance Examination is to secure a youth who has had a thoroughly well-grounded liberal education as an English gentleman. Any curriculum which renders those who are unsuccessful unfit for other professions is greatly to be deprecated.\" The Regulations for the Forest Examination, which follow the lines of the Sandhurst Examination, are intended to provide a test that the candidates have received such an education as is indicated in these words. By these Regulations certain of the subjects specified are prescribed as obligatory for all competitors, while, in the choice of the subjects described as optional, allowance is made for varieties of taste and inclination in each candidate. In view of the influence which the Regulations must necessarily exercise on the education of candidates for admission to the public service, the Civil Service Commissioners deem it expedient to specify, with more fulness than in the Regulations themselves, the character of the Examination which the candidates will be called upon to undergo.\n\nClass I.\n\nMathematics.\u2014The extent of the Examination will be as follows:\u2014\n\n(a.) Algebra, up to and including the Binomial Theorem, the theory and use of Logarithms;\n\n(b.) Euclid, Books I to IV and VI;\n\n(c.) Plane Trigonometry up to and including solution of Triangles and Mensuration.\n\nEnglish Composition.\u2014The standard of positive merit will be looked for in logical arrangement of thought, and in accuracy and propriety of expression, but large deductions of marks will be made for faults of writing and spelling.\n\nCandidates are also warned that, for similar faults in the use of the English language, similar deductions will be made from the marks obtained in the German papers in Class I.\n\nGerman.\u2014There will be translations of unseen passages from German into English, and from English into German; the passages for translation will be taken, mainly, from standard authors, and a few simple questions may be asked on the passages set, as to the structure and character of the language, and allusions of obvious and general interest. The viv\u0101 voce examination will include Dictation.\n\nClass II.\n\nAny two subjects may be taken up.\n\nHigher Mathematics.\n\n* * In all the following subjects great importance will be attached to accuracy in numerical results.\n\nFurther questions and problems on the subjects of the Examination in Mathematics, Class I.\n\nAnd in addition:\u2014\n\nStatics: The equilibrium of forces acting in one plane and of parallel forces, the centre of gravity, the mechanical powers, and friction. (The graphical or geometrical\nmethod of treating such problems should be studied as well as the analytical. No application of the differential calculus to Statics will be required.)\n\nDynamics: Uniform, uniformly accelerated, and uniform circular motion, falling bodies and projectiles in vacuo, collisions and work. (Analytical methods of solution, but not the use of the differential calculus, will be involved.)\n\nAnalytical Geometry: Problems on straight line and circle.\n\nConic Sections: Elementary properties, with easy problems both on the analytical and geometrical methods.\n\nFrench.\u2014The passages for translation will be taken mainly from standard authors, and in other respects the Examination will proceed on the same lines as in German.\n\nLatin.\u2014Passages selected from the authors usually read in schools will be set for translation into English. Passages from English authors will be given for translation into Latin prose and verse, but Candidates will be allowed, in the place of verse composition, to answer questions of a simple character, which will test whether they possess a fundamental knowledge of the grammar of the language, and such an elementary acquaintance with Roman history as is required for the intelligent study of the books they have read.\n\nGreek.\u2014Passages will be set for translation into English from the authors usually read in schools, and in other respects the examination will proceed on the same lines as in Latin.\n\nEnglish History.\u2014The general paper in this subject will test whether the candidates are accurately acquainted with the facts of English history, and also possess an intelligent knowledge of the meaning of the facts. The paper on the fixed period will, of course, require from the candidates more minute knowledge than the general paper.\n\nBotany, Chemistry, Physics, Physical Geography and Geology.\u2014The standard of examination in these subjects will be such as may be reasonably expected from the education given at schools possessing appliances for practical instruction, such as a laboratory, &c. A considerable portion of the marks will be allotted for the proficiency shown in the practical part of the examination.\n\nChemistry will be limited to elements of Inorganic Chemistry.\n\nPhysics will include elementary properties of Electricity, Magnetism, Heat, Light, and Sound.\n\nGeology, chiefly economic, including the recognition of the more familiar minerals and rocks, and their properties and uses.\n\nClass III.\n\nBoth subjects may be taken up.\n\nDrawing.\u2014Freehand.\n\nDrawing.\u2014Geometrical.\n\nGeneral.\n\nHandwriting.\u2014In estimating the papers of candidates, a limited number of marks, namely, 100 out of the maximum allotted to each subject is assigned for handwriting.\n\nINDIA OFFICE APPOINTMENTS.\n\nVacancies in the clerical establishment of the Secretary of State for India are filled from among the successful candidates at the General Examinations (Class I. and Second Division), which are held from time to time by the Civil Service Commissioners for appointments in the home Civil Service. Particulars may be obtained upon application to the Secretary, Civil Service Commission., Cannon Row, S.W.\nABSTRACT OF THE SECOND EDITION OF THE CIVIL SERVICE REGULATIONS.\n\n(With subsequent additions and corrections.)\n\n[Want of space has rendered it necessary to omit many rules which, it should be understood, are of equal force with those here printed. A complete copy of the Civil Service Regulations can be seen on personal application at the Record Department of the India Office.]\n\nPART I.\u2014PRELIMINARY.\n\nCHAPTER I.\u2014General Scope.\n\n1. No standing order not contained in these regulations should be quoted or trusted in deciding, or submitting for orders, any question affecting the Pay and Allowances, Leave, Pension, or Travelling Allowances of Officers the conditions of whose service are not defined by the Army and Marine Regulations. If any Officer thinks that any order not embodied in these regulations ought to be revived, he should refer the question, through the proper channel, to the Government of India. Without the special authority of the Government of India no such order is valid.\n\n6. (a) The Government of India reserves to itself the right of modifying the Leave Rules in these regulations as may from time to time seem to it expedient, and of interpreting them in case of dispute.\n\n(b) In all contracts for service in India to which the Secretary of State is a party, provision is made for the exercise by the Government of these rights.\n\n(c) An officer's claim to leave is regulated by the rules in force at the time that the leave is applied for and granted.\n\n7. (a) The Government also reserves to itself the right of changing the Pension Rules from time to time at its discretion, and of interpreting their meaning. An officer's claim to pension is governed by the rules in force at the time when he resigns or is discharged from the service of Government; he is not entitled to concessions withdrawn before, or made after his resignation or discharge.\n\nNote.\u2014The following extract from a Resolution of the Government of India, No. 4,863, dated 4th December, 1891, relates to the exercise of the right reserved in Articles 5 to 7 to alter the leave and pension rules from time to time:\n\n'Her Majesty's Secretary of State for India, having examined the particular instances which were mentioned in support of the complaints referred to in clause (c) of paragraph 1 of this resolution, regarding the manner in which the right to alter the leave and pension rules had been exercised by the Government of India, expressed the opinion that in none of them had there been any interference with the rights of the servants of the Government. The Government of India have always been careful to exercise the right of altering rules with due consideration for the rights of their servants. The ordinary course adopted to prevent hardship arising from any change of rule found necessary has been either to defer the introduction of the change for some time after its publication, or to give the officers affected the right of choosing whether they shall come under the operation of the old or of the new rules. It has been decided that the right of altering rules must be maintained, that care should be taken, as in the past, to prevent the introduction of any new rules from operating harshly, but that the Local Governments and the Government of India should not consider themselves precluded from recommending an exception in any case of individual hardship which may arise in spite of the precautions taken. If any case of apparent hardship arises, the local authorities should understand that, when the officer applies to retire, they are not precluded from examining into its merits and ascertaining whether, in their opinion, he has substantially suffered from the introduction of a rule not in force at the time he entered the service. If, after comparing the advantages secured to the officer by the altered rules with any disadvantages incidentally involved, they find that he has on the whole substantially suffered, the point may be taken into consideration in determining whether some compensation ought not to be granted in the particular instance.'\n\n(b) The general purport of this rule is inserted by the Secretary of State in all Covenants for Service in India, to which conditions relating to Pension are attached.\n\n(c) In accordance with the principle laid down in clause (a) the claims of persons who have already left the service of Government must be determined by the rules which were in force at the time they left it. These regulations do not necessarily apply to them.\nCHAPTER II.\u2014DEFINITIONS.\n\n8. Unless there be something repugnant in the subject or context, the terms defined in this chapter are used in the Regulations in the sense here explained. When these terms are, in the Regulations, printed in italics, it is meant that the rule cannot be fully applied without reference to the definition.\n\n9. Absentee means an Officer absent from an appointment on which he has a lien, either on leave or on deputation to another appointment, whether permanent or temporary or on special duty unconnected with his own appointment, or on joining time during transfer to another appointment, or under suspension.\n\n10. Accountant General includes 'Comptroller General' and 'Comptroller.'\n\n11. Active Service includes, besides time spent on duty in India\u2014\n\n(i) Privilege Leave of Absence; including the corresponding leave (called 'Short Leave on Private Affairs' and 'Leave on Private Affairs') under the Covenanted Service Leave Rules in force before the 1st July, 1868.\n\n(ii) Subsidiary Leave of Absence; including the corresponding leave (called 'Special Leave') under the Covenanted Service Leave Rules in force before the 1st of July, 1868, and also the corresponding leave (called 'Preparatory Leave') under the previous Indian Service Leave Rules.\n\n(iii) Time spent on the voyage to India by an Officer who is recalled to duty before the expiry of any recognized leave out of India, and (if within a year from the date on which he can be spared, the officer takes the unexpired portion of the leave from which he was recalled) the time spent on the return voyage to Europe.\n\n(iv) And, for purposes of Pension, period of absence from India on duty of an Officer deputed or detained out of India on duty.\n\n(v) Examination leave of absence under Article 314 is also active service, provided that not more than twelve months of such leave can be so reckoned to any officer; and that leave granted under clauses (c) and (d) of Article 314 is not reckoned as active service, unless the Officer passes the Examination for which the leave is granted. Leave admissible under Article 315-A., for the purpose of studying the Chinese language, also counts as active service, provided that the Officer successfully passes the Examination for which the leave is granted.\n\n12. (a) In the case of a Member of the Indian Civil Service, Active Service includes, also\u2014\n\n(i) The interval between the date of an Officer's first arrival in India, and the date on which he joins his first appointment.\n\n(ii) Time passed in India, out of employ, on Subsistence Allowance, but not on Furlough.\n\n(iii) Leave of Absence on urgent private affairs granted before the 3rd January, 1863.\n\n1. One year of Leave of Absence on Medical Certificate was reckoned as 'Residence' under the Covenanted Service Leave Rules in force before the 1st July, 1868. This is not reckoned as Active Service.\n\n(b) The 'Active Service' of a Statutory Native Civil Servant is defined in Section 1 (a) of the Rules under Article 626.\n\n13. In the case of a Military Officer subject to the Civil Leave Rules 'Active Service,' for the purpose of calculating the amount of leave admissible under these regulations, commences from the date of first substantive appointment in the Civil Department, or from the date of completion of three years' continuous officiating service in the Civil Department, whichever may be the earlier. But an officer of the Royal Engineers who was in civil employ on the 1st November, 1886, and elected for Continuous Service in India, counts Active Service from the date of his election.\n\n1. For the purpose of determining whether leave may be granted to such an officer, and the amount of the leave allowances, Continuous Service and Active Service include any previous service which would be treated as such under these Regulations.\n\n2. Article 12 (a), clauses (ii) and (iii) above, apply to Military Officers subject to the Civil Leave Rules.\n\n14. The 'Active Service' of a Chaplain is defined in Article 637.\n\n14A. In the case of Engineers appointed from the Royal Indian Engineering College at Cooper's Hill, who passed out of the College from the years 1878 to 1889, both inclusive, Active Service includes also the whole period from date of appointment to the service to date of joining their appointments in India, provided they fulfil the conditions in regard to date of landing in India specified in Article 691. The exception in favour of officers of these years is made in consequence of an error in the letters of appointment and in the College prospectus, which affected students of the years 1878 to 1886, as ruled in Secretary of State's Despatches Nos. 24 and 37, dated respectively the 26th April, 1883, and 28th July, 1892.\n\n14B. In the case of officers of the Telegraph Department appointed from the Royal Indian Engineering College at Cooper's Hill from the years 1883 to 1891, both inclusive, Active Service includes also the whole period from date of appointment to the service to date of joining their appointments in India, provided they reach India within the period named in their letter of appointment: otherwise from date of arrival in India. The exception in favour of these officers is made in consequence of an error in the letters of appointment, as ruled in Secretary of State's Despatches Nos. 25 and 37, dated...\nrespectively the 12th June, 1884, and 28th July, 1892.\n\n16. Appointments are said to be in the same 'Class' when they are in the same Department, and bear the same designation, or have been declared by the Government of India to be in the same Class. Appointments in the same Class are sometimes divided into 'Grades,' according to pay.\n\n17. Audit Officer means the account and audit officer, whatever his official designation, in whose circle of audit a public servant is serving or (in respect to verification of service) has served, i.e.\u2014\n\nFor service in an ordinary civil establishment\u2014the Accountant-General.\nFor service in the Public Works Department\u2014the Examiner of P.

(a) Average Salary for the purposes of the European Service Leave Rules in Part III. means the salary which an Officer has earned during so much of his Continuous Active Service as is within the three years preceding the day on which he gives up office; Provided that neither Subsidiary Leave, nor any period during which an Officer has been out of employ in India otherwise than as a penalty for misconduct, shall be included in Active Service for the purposes of such calculation.\n\n(b) For the purposes of the Indian Service Leave Rules in Part III. means the Average Salary calculated for so much of the three years immediately preceding the day on which the officer gives up office as he has passed on duty, or on Privilege Leave.\n\n19. Barrister means a practising Barrister of England or Ireland, and a practising Member of the Faculty of Advocates of the Court of Session of Scotland. It does not include a person who, though a Barrister, has never practised the profession of Barrister.\n\n20. Calendar Month.\u2014Whenever it is necessary to calculate a period in 'Calendar Months,' the period ends either on the day of the month corresponding with the day before the day on which it begins, or, if there is no such corresponding day in that month, then on the last day of the month.\n\nExamples.\n\nA period of six Calendar Months beginning on the\u2014ends on the\u2014\n28th February ... 27th August.\n31st March or 1st April ... 30th September.\n29th August ... 28th February.\n30th August to 1st Sept. last day of February.\n\nA period of three Calendar Months beginning on the\u2014ends on the\u2014\n29th November ... 28th February.\n30th Nov. or 1st Dec. ... last day of February.\n\n23.

Continuous Service and Continuous Active Service mean the Service, and Active Service, of an Officer since his last return from Furlough or Extraordinary Leave lasting more than three months; or, if he have not had such Leave, since the beginning of his Active Service. No leave may be included in Continuous Service, except Privilege Leave and Special Leave; and in the case of a Royal Engineer who has elected for Continuous Service in India, furlough on urgent private affairs under Rule XI. of the Rules of 1868.\n\n1. Examination Leave, under Article 314, may also be included, unless the Officer have already had twelve months such Leave, or in the case of Leave granted under Clauses (c) and (d) of Article 314, unless the Officer have failed to pass the Examination for which the Leave was granted.\n\nLeave admissible under Article 315-A., for the purpose of studying the Chinese language may also be included, unless the Officer fails to pass the Examination for which the leave is granted.\n\n27.

Indian Civil Service.\u2014The expression 'Indian Civil Service' shall mean the service heretofore known as the Covenanted Civil Service.\n\n37. Lien on Appointment.\u2014When an Officer is said to have a lien on an appointment, it is meant that the right of such an Officer to resume on return to duty a substantive or an acting appointment on which he has a lien is subject to the same condition of conformity with the interest of the public service as the tenure of the appointment is. An officer may have a lien on an appointment without having actually joined it.\n\n38. (a) Local Allowance.\u2014A 'Local Allowance' is an Allowance not specially declared to be 'Pay' or 'Salary,' given to an Officer of Government in addition to pay or salary, either for duties which do not properly belong to his office, or in consideration of exceptional local circumstances, such as the unhealthiness or expensiveness of the locality or duty, or the especially arduous nature of the work.\n\n(b) Subject to the provisions of Articles 78 and 300 to 305 a Local Allowance is paid in full to the Officer actually present on duty, and is not taken into account in calculating Leave Allowances or Pension.\n\n39.

Pay and Salary.\u2014\n(a) \u2018Pay\u2019 means \u2018Monthly Substantive Pay.\u2019\n(b) For the purposes of the European Service Leave Rules in Part III., \u2018Pay\u2019 includes also the Subsistence Allowance of a Member of the Indian Civil Service or a Military Officer subject to the Civil Leave Rules who has an officiating but not a substantive appointment. (But see Rule 2 under Article 42.)\n(c) \u2018Salary\u2019 means the sum of Pay and Acting Allowance or Charge Allowance under Article 115 or Chapter VIII.\n\n1. Personal Allowance is treated, for the purposes of calculating Leave Allowances and Pensions, as part of an Officer\u2019s Substantive Pay.\n\n2. If an Officer whose whole time is retained for the public service is appointed to hold, jointly with any other Government office, a Minor Professorship under the Medical Warrant of April, 1867, or a Professorship or Lectureship in any Government Institution, the allowances received by him in such appointment are part of his salary.\n\n3. \u2018Salary\u2019 does not include House-rent, Tentage, or Travelling Allowances\u2014whether daily, monthly, or yearly; nor does it include a Local Allowance.\n\n4. The charge allowance admissible to Permanent Telegraph Masters under Public Works Department Resolution No. 125 T. E., dated the 7th August, 1889, is included in salary for the purpose of calculating the leave allowances of such officers.\n\nNote.\u2014[These definitions do not necessarily apply to the Statutory Rules under Articles 600, 632, &c.]\n\n48. The \u2018Pay of an Appointment\u2019 means the pay which any particular Officer would receive monthly if he held the appointment substantively.\n\n49. (a) The \u2018Pay of an Officer\u2019 is, in the case of an Officer with a substantive appointment, the amount which he would receive monthly, under any of the following designations, in his substantive appointment:\u2014\n\nSubstantive Pay.\nConsolidated Pay.\nMilitary Pay and Allowances and Staff Salary.\nStaff Corps Pay and Staff Salary.\n\n(b) In the case of an Officer without a substantive appointment\u2014his monthly Subsistence Allowance (if a Member of the Indian Civil Service, a Statutory Civil Servant, or a Military Officer subject to the Civil Leave Rules); and his Military Pay and Allowances or Staff Corps Pay (if a Military Officer subject to the Military Leave Rules).\n\n50. Pension.\u2014Except when the term \u2018Pension\u2019 is used in contradistinction to \u2018Gratuity,\u2019 \u2018Pension\u2019 includes \u2018Gratuity.\u2019\n\n51. Pensionable Office or Pensionable Service.\u2014Service is said to be \u2018Pensionable\u2019 when it qualifies; and an Office is said to be \u2018Pensionable\u2019 when service therein counts.\n\n53. Progressive Appointment means an appointment the pay of which is progressive, and Progressive Pay is pay which, subject to the good behaviour of an Officer, rises, by periodical increments, from a minimum to a maximum.\n\nNote.\u2014[For brevity\u2019s sake, a Progressive Pay is described by three groups of figures, namely: the minimum, the increment, and the maximum.\n\nExample.\u2014A pay of Rs. 100-20-200 means a pay rising from Rs. 100 by a yearly increment of Rs. 20 to Rs. 200.]\n\n55. Qualify.\u2014\u2018Qualify\u2019 and \u2018Count\u2019 mean qualify and count for Pension from the General Revenues or for Leave of Absence, as the case may be.\n\n57. Salary.\u2014See \u2018Pay and Salary,\u2019 Article 47.\n\n58. Staff Salary is an allowance to a Military Officer in addition to the Military Pay and Allowances or the Staff Corps Pay of his rank.\n\n58a. Statutory Civil Servant.\u2014A Statutory Civil Servant is a Native of India who was appointed under Notification No. 1,534 of the Government of India, Home Department, dated the 22nd of August, 1879, to an office, place or employment referred to in Section 6 of 33 Vict., cap. 3.\n\n59. Warrant Officer.\u2014\n(a) \u2018A Warrant Officer\u2019 includes every Warrant Officer, to whichever Military Furlough Rules he may be subject, and whether he hold an Honorary or Veteran Commission or not.\n(b) The grades of Warrant Officers are\u2014\n\n1st Class\nDeputy Commissary.\nAssistant Commissary.\nDeputy Assistant Commissary.\n\n2nd Class\nConductor.\nSub-Conductor.\n\nOf the Subordinate Medical Department, Senior Apothecaries rank as 1st Class Warrant Officers (Army Regulations, Vol. I., Articles 852 and 853).\nPART II.\u2014RULES REGARDING PAY AND ALLOWANCES,\n\nChapter III.\u2014General Rules.\n\n63. A person whose age exceeds twenty-five years may not ordinarily be admitted into the service of the State. The ordinary limit is extended to thirty years in the case of a person appointed to a Judicial Office.\n\n64. Unless it be otherwise provided by special rule or contract, the salary of an Officer begins when he takes charge of the appointment in respect of which it is earned.\n\n65. Subject to the provisions of the Subsidiary Leave Rules in Chapter XIII., Articles 352 to 365, the first day of an Officer's leave is the first day on which he has not charge of his office after noon, and the last day of his leave is the last day on which he has not charge before noon.\n\n66. An Officer may leave India, or return to India, by any port; but his Furlough or Special Leave begins on, and includes, the day of the vessel's departure from the port where he first meets it, and ends on the day before its arrival at the port where he last quits it.\n\nExample.\u2014The Furlough or Special Leave of an Officer sailing from Calcutta in a vessel which touches at Madras begins on the departure of the vessel from Calcutta, and not from Madras.\n\n76. Promotion during Leave.\u2014If an Officer while absent on 'short leave' during which the amount of his leave allowances depends upon the substantive or officiating rank or appointment which he would hold if present on duty, obtains promotion, substantive or officiating, or an increase of pay, or acting allowance, which involves no change in, or addition to, his duties or responsibilities, the promotion or increase has effect at once. Otherwise, the promotion of an absent Officer has effect only from the date of his return to duty.\n\n81. Advances and their Recovery.\u2014The following rules regulate the grant of advances to Officers on arrival in India on first appointment to the service of the Government of India and to Officers returning from leave or special duty out of India:\n\n(a) An advance of an amount not exceeding two months' pay, and also not exceeding 1,000 rupees, may be made to any public officer in the Civil Department on arrival in India on first appointment or on return from long leave or special duty out of India. This advance is independent of any advance on account of allowances, made by the Secretary of State in England.\n\n(b) The advance may be drawn under the orders of the Audit Officer from any treasury in India to be specified in such orders.\n\n(c) Such advances, as well as similar advances issued by the Home Government, are to be recovered by monthly instalments of one-third of salary.\n\nNote.\u2014[Clause (c) does not apply \"in the case of a military officer in civil employ subject to the Military Leave Rules granted an advance under those Rules; nor does it apply to\" Covenanted Engine-drivers, Mechanics, Boiler-makers, &c., recoveries from whom are regulated by Article 735 in Chapter XXXI. (State Railway Revenue Establishments).]\n\n81A. A Civil Officer returning from furlough out of India is not granted an advance of allowance for more than thirty-five days beyond the date of embarkation for India.\n\n82. If an Officer receives an advance of pay in England to enable him to return to duty in India, the advance will be recovered at the rate or rates of exchange fixed for the adjustment of financial transactions between the Imperial and Indian Governments for the year in which the advance was made. This rule will also apply when an advance is made in England to a person appointed there, proceeding to India to join his appointment.\n\n83. Transfer on Duty.\u2014(a) No Officer (unless he has been newly appointed to the service of Government) can begin to draw any pay or allowances at any treasury in India, or at the Home Treasury of the Government of India without producing a last-pay certificate from the treasury where his pay or allowances were last disbursed, or from the Accountant-General within whose jurisdiction this treasury is.\n\nChapter IV.\u2014Deputation to Europe.\n\n102. A Military Officer in military employ, who is permitted to proceed to Europe for the purpose of acquiring professional information, or is deputed on special duty to Europe, receives during the period of his absence from India the full Indian pay and allowances of his rank and half Staff Salary.\n\n103. A Civil Officer, or a Military Officer in civil employ, who, with the sanction of the Secretary of State, is deputed to Europe on special civil duty, is entitled, from the date on which he makes over charge of his office in India to the date on which he resumes it, to an allowance not exceeding two-thirds of the salary which he would draw were he on duty in India.\n\n104. A Civil Officer, or a Military Officer in civil employ, who, under the orders of the Secretary of State, is detained in Europe on civil duty, or permitted to remain on special civil duty, beyond the period of his leave, is entitled\u2014\n\n(i) If on any leave other than privilege leave\u2014to an allowance not exceeding two-thirds of his pay and allowances in India;\n\n(ii) If on privilege leave\u2014to an allowance not exceeding half his pay and allowances in India, for the period during which he is so detained or permitted to remain on special civil duty.\n127. An Officer without a substantive appointment is entitled to subsistence allowance with an acting allowance of half the pay of any appointment in which he officiates.\n\n1. The monthly subsistence allowance for a Member of the Indian Civil Service, is as follows:\n\n| Rs. |\n|-----|\n| To an Officer of not more than eight years' actual residence in India... | 250 |\n| To an Officer of more than eight, but less than twelve years' actual residence in India... | 320 |\n| To an Officer of twelve or more years' actual residence in India... | 400 |\n\nChapter IX.\u2014Joining Time.\n\n193. Joining Time is the time allowed to an Officer to proceed from one Station to another when his appointment is changed, or when, being unemployed, he is appointed to any office. An Officer is held to be on duty during Joining Time, if he is entitled to allowances.\n\n194. Only one day is allowed for joining an appointment which does not, necessarily, involve a change of residence.\n\n195. In cases involving a change of Station, Joining Time is calculated as follows, subject to a maximum of thirty days. Sundays not actually spent in travelling are not included in the calculation:\n\n(i) Six days for preparation; and, in addition thereto,\n\nfor the portion of the journey which the Officer travels, or\n\nby Railway ... ... 200 miles,\nby Ocean Steamer 150 \",\nby River Steamer 80 \",\nby Mail Cart or other public stage conveyance drawn by horses 80 \",\n\nin any other way ... 15 \"\n\nAn extra day is allowed for any fraction of distance over that prescribed.\n\n(ii) When part of the journey is by steamer, the days intervening between the Officer being set free from his office, or, if he has no office, receiving his orders, and the departure of the steamer, or his start duly regulated to catch the steamer, shall be added.\n\n196. By whatever route the Officer travels, his Joining Time shall, unless the Local Government specially permit otherwise, be calculated by the route which travellers habitually use.\n\n205. Allowances.\u2014Except in the case mentioned in Article 203, an Officer will draw, during Joining Time, the pay or salary which he drew in his old appointment, or that which he will draw on joining his new appointment, whichever may be less; provided that an Officer transferred from one officiating appointment to another shall not draw any acting allowance during Joining Time if he had not a superior lien on either of the officiating appointments to that of the Officer relieved by or relieving him. If the Officer is entitled to tentage in his old appointment and tentage is also attached to his new appointment, he may draw tentage during Joining Time at the lower of the two rates. If the Officer in his old appointment drew a local allowance granted on account of special expensiveness of living in any district, province, or locality, and the transfer is to another appointment within the same district, province, or locality, he may draw the local allowance during joining time. Provided that, if the rates differ in the two appointments or parts of the local area, he may draw the lower rate only.\n\n209. An Officer who does not join his new appointment within his Joining Time, is entitled to no allowances after the end of his Joining Time, and, after a week, ceases to have a lien on any appointment. But if the Local Government considers that his default was due to circumstances beyond his control, it may exempt him from the loss of his appointment.\n\nNote.\u2014[The expression 'allowances' in this Article does not include travelling allowances.]\n\nPART III.\u2014LEAVE RULES.\n\nChapter XI.\u2014General Conditions of Leave.\n\n219. Extent of Application.\u2014The rules in this Chapter apply to all Officers in civil employ, except in so far as they are inconsistent with, or over-ridden by, the special conditions of leave which obtain in the case of the following classes of Officers:\n\n(a) Lieutenant-Governors and Members of Council (see Chapter XXII).\n\n(b) Judges of the High Court (see Chapter XXIII).\n\n(c) Barristers holding the appointments of Judge of the Chief Court of the Punjab, First Judge of the Small Cause Courts of Presidency Towns, Recorder of Rangoon, or Secretary to the Government of India in the Legislative Department (see Chapter XXIV).\n\n(d) Statutory Civil Servants (see Chapter XXVI).\n\n(e) Ecclesiastical Officers (see Chap. XXVII).\n\n(f) Military Officers subject to the Military Leave Rules (see Chapter XXVIII and Appendices Nos. 11 and 12).\n\n(g) Law Officers (see Chapter XXX).\n\n(h) State Railway Establishments (see Chapter XXXI).\n\n(i) Bengal Covenanted Pilot Service (see Chapter XXXII).\n\n(j) Port Blair Police (see Chapter XXXIII).\n\n(k) Officers serving under Special Contracts. (Their Contract.)\n\n1. An Officer under contract is not entitled to leave, except in accordance with the terms of his contract. But if a Civil Engineer or other Officer belonging to one of the classes enumerated in Article 330, and appointed thereto by Her Majesty's Secretary of State, or with his\nparticular sanction, or whose name is entered in Appendix No. 3, is, by the terms of his contract of service, entitled to leave under the 'Unconvenanted Service Leave Rules,' the Rules referred to shall be held to be European Service Leave Rules prescribed in this part of the regulations.\n\nNote.\u2014[If the health of an Officer, who is serving under an agreement which does not give a title to leave until the expiry of a fixed period, fails during that period, his engagement should be terminated unless\u2014\n\n(i) he has exhibited such special ability that it is desirable on public grounds to retain him, even at the cost of the difference between a leave allowance and any passage money, &c., due under his agreement; and\n\n(ii) it is certified that he will in all probability be able to return to duty at or before the end of six months.\n\nIn cases in which the engagement is not terminated, leave may be granted for a period not exceeding six months, and on allowances not exceeding half pay.]\n\n220. Discretion of Government.\u2014(a) Leave of absence can never be claimed absolutely as of right. Nothing in these regulations must be understood to limit the free discretion of the Government to refuse or revoke leave of absence of any description, at any time, according to the exigencies of the Public Service.\n\n(b) The Local Government may refuse to grant the full amount of leave applied for in any case, and should, by the exercise of this power, so regulate the date of an officer's return from leave as to cause as little change as possible in administrative arrangements.\n\n222. Maximum Leave Admissible.\u2014After five years' continuous absence, whether with or without leave, an Officer is considered to be out of Government employ.\n\nNote.\u2014[This article does not apply to Officers transferred to Foreign Service in India.]\n\n223. Recalled from Leave.\u2014An Officer recalled to duty before the expiry of leave of any kind is entitled to take the balance of his leave, together with any leave of the same kind subsequently earned, as soon as he can be spared from duty. Time occupied in the voyage to India on recall from recognised leave out of India counts as active service under Article 11(iii).\n\n224. An Officer recalled to duty before the expiry of any recognised leave out of India is entitled to free passage to India, besides travelling allowance from the port of embarkation in India to the Station to which he is posted. During the voyage to India leave allowances only are granted.\n\nNote.\u2014[\"It is desirable that whenever it is found necessary to order an officer to return to India before the expiration of his leave, the instructions should be communicated to him officially through the Secretary of State.\"\u2014Despatch from the Secretary of State, No. 168 (Financial), dated 31st July, 1889.]\n\n225. An Officer recalled to duty before the expiry of leave in India, other than Privilege Leave, is treated as on duty (i.e., on joining time between appointments) from the date on which he starts for the Station to which he is ordered, and is entitled to his travelling allowances on his journey to the Station to which he is posted.\n\n226. An officer recalled to duty from Privilege Leave is entitled to no concession except that mentioned in Article 223.\n\nService Qualifying for Leave.\n\n231. (a) Service in the Army, which, under Article 388, counts towards civil pension, qualifies also for leave. Any leave taken by an Officer during such service will, in the calculation of future leave, be treated as if it had been taken under these regulations.\n\n(b) Otherwise save as provided in Articles 230, 272, and 275 these regulations do not apply to Military Officers or Soldiers, or to the Military Branch of the Subordinate Medical Service.\n\n232. Service before Resignation.\u2014Save as provided for in Articles 233 and 234, an officer who is discharged from, or resigns, the Public Service, and is re-employed after an interval, cannot, without the sanction of the Government of India, count his service before discharge or resignation towards leave after re-employment.\n\n233. An Officer discharged from the Indian Navy on its abolition, and subsequently re-employed, may count his naval service towards leave after re-employment, notwithstanding the occurrence of a moderate interval between his discharge from the Indian Navy and his first re-employment. Any leave taken by such Officer while in the Indian Navy will be treated, in calculating the leave due to him under these regulations, as if such leave had been taken under the rules to which he became subject on re-employment.\n\n235. Service as Private Secretary to the Governor-General, a Governor, or a Lieutenant-Governor, qualifies for leave, provided that the Officer (before his appointment as Private Secretary) belonged to the Civil Service (whether the Indian Civil Service or not) or to the Staff Corps, or to any of the Indian Establishments of the British Army.\n\n235A. After a continuous service of three years, a Private Secretary, whose case is not provided for by the preceding article, may be granted leave on medical certificate to the extent of one year with a leave allowance equal to half his salary, and subject to a maximum of \u00a31,000 a year.\n\n238. Foreign Service and Service under Local Funds.\u2014The rules regarding the Furlough Allowance of Officers lent to Foreign Service, including service under Her Majesty's Government in England or under any Colonial or Foreign Government outside of India, and regarding Privilege Leave Allowance of Officers taking employment under the Egyptian Government, are contained in Part VII.\n\n240. Lien on Appointment.\u2014(a) Subject to his good conduct and efficiency, an Officer under the European Service Leave Rules, on Ordinary Furlough, or on Special Leave, has a lien on his substantive appointment or on a substantive appointment of a like character and not less pay. He has no lien on an acting appointment.\n\n(b) On other Furlough, a Member of the Indian Civil Service, or a Military Officer subject to the Civil Leave Rules, has no lien; but a Civil Engineer or other Officer subject to the European Service Rules has a lien. (See also Article 345.)\n\n241. An Officer on 'Long Leave' has no\nclaim to substantive promotion; but there is no objection to such promotion. (See Article 76.)\n\n242. An Officer on leave may not surrender his lien on his substantive appointment and, except on the ground of the Officer's misbehaviour or inefficiency, a Local Government may not fill up substantively, even for a time only, an appointment on which an Officer has a lien, without transferring the Officer to another substantive appointment of not less pay. The saving which accrues to the State by paying acting, instead of substantive allowance, must be carefully secured as a set-off against the cost of leave allowances.\n\n243. An Officer cannot obtain Ordinary Furlough or retain allowances under Article 346, unless he has a substantive appointment. A Military Officer who has no substantive civil appointment and has not been in continuous Civil employ for at least three years, continues subject to Military Rules, and can only get Military Furlough Allowances.\n\nCompulsory Retirement.\n\n244. If a Local Government considers it inexpedient that an Officer should return from leave out of India, it should furnish a complete statement of the circumstances to the Secretary of State (in the case of the Government of Madras or Bombay, direct, or otherwise, through the Government of India), if possible, when the Furlough or Special Leave is granted, but, in any case, in time to enable the Secretary of State to take any measures that may seem to him necessary before the Officer would, in ordinary course, be permitted to return to duty. The report to the Secretary of State should reach the India Office, at latest, three months before the end of the Officer's leave.\n\n249. Vacating Appointment.\u2014No Officer's appointment becomes vacant simply by reason of his taking leave under the Indian Service Leave Rules. But absence without leave, or after the end of leave, except in the case of the week's grace allowed by Clause (ii) of Article 261 (a), involves loss of appointment.\n\n250. The Secretary of State in granting to Officers extension of leave sometimes declines to guarantee retention of appointment, if there is no time to communicate with the Local Government in India.\n\nCommencement of Leave.\n\n251. Ordinarily if an Officer makes over charge of his office before noon, his leave in India begins on and includes the day on which he makes over charge; otherwise it begins on and includes the following day, but if the absence of the Officer does not involve the immediate deputation of any Officer from another station, or any formal transfer of charge in the way of taking over money, or the like, then the absentee may leave his station at the close of the last day on which the office is open for business before his leave begins. In such case the several transfers of charge dependent upon the departure of the absentee shall take effect from the close of the last working day as aforesaid. But, subject to the provisions of Article 359, the leave of the absentee and the re-arrangement of allowances, if any, depending upon his departure, shall begin from and include, the first day thereafter on which the office is open for business. The actual date of the Officer's departure from his station must, however, always be reported.\n\nNote.\u2014[For the purposes of this Article the office is regarded as closed for business only on Sundays and gazetted holidays.]\n\n252. The rules regarding commencement of leave out of India will be found in Article 359.\n\n253. An Officer taking Furlough or Special Leave out of India must report his embarkation through the Audit Officer to the Local Government (or other Authority) which granted his leave, and his arrival in England to the Secretary of State.\n\nReturn to Duty.\n\nNote.\u2014[Articles 256 to 262 apply to Military officers subject to the Military Leave Rules only in respect to leave of absence granted in the Civil Department.]\n\n256. An Officer may not, without the permission of the Authority which granted him leave, return to duty more than fourteen days before the end of Long Leave. This Rule applies to a Military Officer subject to the Military Leave Rules; but he must obtain permission to return to duty from the Local Government.\n\n257. An Officer on Long Leave in Europe may not return to India without obtaining the permission of the Secretary of State. He must apply for this permission at least three months before the end of his leave. An Officer whose Long Leave was granted or has been extended on medical certificate is required to produce a certificate of fitness before he can be permitted to return to duty. Ordinarily, he must obtain this certificate from the Medical Board of the India Office, but, in special cases, particularly if the officer be residing at a distance of more than sixty miles from London, the Secretary of State will, at his discretion, accept a certificate from two medical practitioners in lieu thereof.\n\n257A. An officer on leave on medical certificate in India, or in any place out of Europe, may be required by the authority who granted the leave to produce, before he is permitted to return to duty, a medical certificate of fitness signed by such medical officer as the authority may direct.\n\n258. An officer is not entitled, at the end of Long Leave out of India or Subsidiary Leave affixed thereto, to resume, as a matter of course, without further orders the particular appointment which he vacated before his Long Leave. He should report his return to duty in the manner prescribed in Article 260 and await orders.\n\n259. If the appointment of an officer is changed during Long Leave in India, he must join his new appointment within his leave. But the Local Government may allow him joining time if he have not had sufficient notice of the change. During such joining time his allowances will be the same as for subsidiary leave on return from furlough.\n\n260. A gazetted Officer must report his return to duty to the Local Government under which he is employed. A Member of the Indian Civil Service on the Bengal Establishment employed directly under the Government of India, returning from Long Leave, must also report his return to the Government of India in the Home Department.\n\n261. (a) An Officer who remains absent after the end of his Leave is entitled to no allowance\nfor the period of such absence, and ceases to have a lien on any appointment.\n\n(i) If his Leave was Furlough under the European Service Leave Rules, or Furlough or Leave on Medical Certificate under the Indian Service Leave Rules,\u2014immediately; and\n\n(ii) If it was Special Leave under the European Service Leave Rules, Leave on private affairs under the Indian Service Rules, or Privilege Leave,\u2014after a week, unless, in the case of officers stationed in the Andamans and Nicobars, the overstay is authorised by Clause (ii) of Article 283 (a).\n\n(b) The provisions of this article have no effect on the liability of an Officer overstaying leave in regard to the forfeiture of past service, the rule as to which is contained in Article 463 (b) in Part IV.\n\nEXTENSION AND COMMUTATION OF LEAVE.\n\n254. No kind of leave, except Extraordinary Leave without allowances under Articles 366 and 372, leave under Article 321, and in certain cases Examination Leave can be granted in continuation of any other kind of leave; but any leave granted under these regulations may be retrospectively changed for any other kind or period of leave for which the Officer was qualified when the leave was originally granted; and the Local Government may commute retrospectively periods of absence without leave into leave without allowances (see Article 464 in Part IV.). Subsidiary leave is not, for the purposes of this rule, regarded as a continuation of leave.\n\n265. The grant or Extension of Furlough, under Article 264 (otherwise than on medical certificate), is subject to Proviso (iv) under Article 340 (b).\n\n266. If an Officer subject to the Indian Service Leave Rules who is absent on Privilege Leave, or on leave on private affairs, or on Furlough, takes an extension of leave on medical certificate, the whole of the absence will be treated as leave on medical certificate.\n\n267. Extraordinary leave without allowances cannot be converted retrospectively into leave on medical certificate; but leave on medical certificate may be given in continuation of Extraordinary Leave without allowances.\n\n268. (a) An Officer absent on Long Leave in Europe or in any of the colonies in America or the West Indies, who wishes to have his leave extended or commuted, must apply to the Secretary of State about three months before the expiration of his leave, and produce with his application evidence that the Local Government had been referred to by him, and that the Local Government had no objection to the extension or commutation desired.\n\n(b) This rule will be strictly enforced, and Officers returning to India, at times other than those fixed for them by their own Government, must understand that they are liable to be kept on subsistence allowance until a suitable vacancy occurs to which to post them.\n\n(c) The Secretary of State, however, reserves to himself the power of granting extension or commutation of leave to an Officer, in any case in which it appears to him that sufficient ground has been shown for the application being made, without the previous approval of the Local Government; but in the event of it being found necessary by the Secretary of State to communicate with the Government of India or the Government of Madras or Bombay by telegraph in regard to any such application, the cost of the telegrams to and from India will be charged to the applicant.\n\n(d) Furlough out of India on medical certificate may be commuted into leave without medical certificate if such leave was due at the time when the original furlough was granted, and if the Officer seeking commutation is certified, in the manner prescribed in Article 257, to have recovered his health. When extension of the commuted furlough is applied for, the Officer applying for such extension must produce the necessary evidence that the Local Government to which he is subordinate consents to the extension of his leave.\n\nApplications for extensions of Commuted Furlough on medical certificate should be dealt with by Local Governments in such a way that officers who have preferential claims to furlough under Article 342 are not thereby debarred for a considerable time from availing themselves of the furlough at their credit.\n\nNote.\u2014[This Article applies to the placing of Officers who are on leave out of India on special duty in extension of the leave.]\n\n269. An Officer on Long Leave in any of the colonies or dependencies named in Appendix No. 17, except the colonies in America or the West Indies, who wishes to have his leave extended or commuted, must apply to the Local Government or other authority in India which granted the original leave, three months before the expiration of the leave.\n\n270. When Privilege Leave is, on medical certificate, retrospectively changed for Furlough out of India, so much of the leave passed before the departure of the vessel in which the Officer sails may be treated as Subsidiary Leave under Clause (i) of Article 352 (a) as might have been granted as Subsidiary Leave if the Officer had originally obtained Furlough and not Privilege Leave, notwithstanding that a portion of such retrospective Furlough has been passed in India.\n\n271. In the case of a Military Officer subject to the Military Leave Rules, leave may be retrospectively commuted by the Authority which granted it to any other kind of leave which the said Authority would have been competent to allow when the original leave was sanctioned.\n\nNote.\u2014[Articles 268 to 270 apply to Military Officers subject to the Military Leave Rules.]\nChapter XII.\u2014Short Leave.\n\n272. General Limitation.\u2014The rules in this chapter regulate the Short Leave of all Officers in civil employ (whatever may be the rules to which they are subject in regard to other leave) except\n\n(a) The Governor-General, Governors, Lieutenant-Governors, and Members of Council (see Chapter XXII.).\n\n(b) Judges of the High Court (see Chapter XXIII.).\n\n(c) Barristers holding the appointments referred to in Chapter XXIV, except as stated in that chapter.\n\n(d) Ecclesiastical Officers, except Articles 312 and 314 (see Chapter XXVII.).\n\n(e) Law Officers, except as stated in Chapter XXX.\n\n(f) State Railway Establishments, except as stated in Chapter XXXI.\n\n(g) Bengal Covenanted Pilots, except as stated in Chapter XXXII.\n\n(h) Port Blair Police (see Chapter XXXIII.).\n\n1. Military Officers and Subordinates of the Army employed in the Military Works Department are subject to these regulations as regards Privilege Leave, but as regards leave generally are treated as in Military employ.\n\nPrivilege Leave.\n\n277. The amount of Privilege Leave earned by an Officer is one-eleventh part of the time during which he has been on duty without interruption: Provided that no Privilege Leave can be earned by an Officer by duty performed, while three months' such leave is due to him, and that, whenever duty is interrupted, all claim to Privilege Leave earned theretofore is forfeited. Absence on Privilege Leave, though not counting as duty, is not an interruption of duty within the meaning of this Article.\n\n278. The calculation must be made as follows:\n\n\u2014One calendar month for every eleven complete calendar months of duty, and one day for every eleven days of the balance.\n\n282. Limit.\u2014The amount of Privilege Leave admissible at one time is by the above rules limited to three calendar months; but in the following cases an exception to this general rule is allowed:\u2014\n\n(a) Officers stationed in the Andamans and Nicobars are allowed, on each occasion when they may wish to take Privilege Leave, the option between the following two courses, namely:\u2014\n\n(i) To accumulate Privilege Leave up to three months and fifteen days.\n\n(ii) To overstay any Privilege Leave due by fifteen days without forfeiting pay or appointment provided that, in the case of such overstay, the Officer shall not begin to count service towards future Privilege Leave until he shall have served a period of time proportionate to the amount of overstay\u2014that is, eleven times the period of overstay.\n\nNote.\u2014[The concession in this clause has been extended for a period of five years from 1st July, 1891, to all European officers serving in the Civil Department in Burma.]\n\n283. The Privilege Leave due to an officer is the Privilege Leave which he has earned since the last interruption of duty, less the period during which he has been absent on Privilege Leave.\n\n291. Condition of Grant.\u2014To an Officer who has been on duty, without interruption, for eleven calendar months, and who has not, for six calendar months, been absent on Privilege Leave, the whole or any part of the Privilege Leave due to him may be granted.\n\n292. Lien on Appointment.\u2014An Officer on Privilege Leave has a lien on his substantive appointment; he has also a lien on his officiating appointment, so long as it is not resumed by an Officer having a superior lien on it.\n\n293. Leave Allowances.\u2014Except as provided in Articles 204, 306 (b), and 310, an Officer on Privilege Leave is entitled to a Leave Allowance equal to the salary which he would receive if he were on duty in the appointment on which he has a lien, and he is entitled to this allowance even though another Officer be appointed to act for him.\n\n294. No extra expense may be imposed on the State in respect to the Privilege Leave of an Officer whose pay is less than 100 rupees, and who is allowed Privilege Leave for more than one month at a time.\n\n295. An Officer who has no lien on an appointment is entitled, during Privilege Leave\u2014\n\n(i) In the case of a Member of the Indian Civil Service or a Military Officer subject to the Civil Leave Rules\u2014to Subsistence Allowance.\n\n(ii) In the case of any other Civil Officer\u2014to no allowance.\n\nNote.\u2014[The subsistence allowance of a Military Officer subject to the Civil Leave Rules is the same as that of an Indian Civil Servant (see Article 127, rule 1).]\n\n296. The right to receive Privilege Leave Allowances is contingent (except in the case of death) on the return of an Officer to duty upon the expiry of such leave, whatever be the branch of the service to which he belongs.\n\n297. A non-gazetted Officer whose salary is less than 200 rupees a month is not entitled to receive his allowances for the period of his leave till he returns to duty; he may, however, with the special sanction of the head of his office, receive in advance the allowances which would, but for this rule, become payable to him on the first and second pay days included within the period of his leave. Such advances will be drawn from the Treasury as final establishment charges.\n\nPrivilege Leave in Cases of Regular Vacations.\n\n306. (a) Privilege Leave is not admissible to District and Sessions Judges who are permitted to avail themselves of the periodical court vacations, or to Officers serving in Departments in which regular vacations are allowed, during which the Officers are permitted to be absent from duty, as Judicial Officers, Educational Officers, Officers in a High Court.\n(b) But in case of urgent necessity, Privilege Leave may be granted to any such Officer under the ordinary Rules, subject to the conditions\u2014\n\n(i) That the officer shall, during his absence, receive only half the salary and allowances ordinarily admissible during Privilege Leave, and\n\n(ii) That the leave cannot in any case be combined with vacation.\n\n307. The preceding Article does not apply to the case of an officer who is, by general or special orders issued by competent authority, prevented in any year from availing himself of the vacation or vacations by reason of his having to remain at his post on duty. In such a case Privilege Leave may be granted under the Ordinary rules; provided always that the leave shall not in any case be combined with vacation.\n\nNote.\u2014In the case of every Officer to whom Articles 306 and 307 apply, the presumption is that he will avail himself of the vacation. No certificate of title to Privilege Leave, except the leave in 'case of urgent necessity,' under Article 306 (b), can be given for the period of service rendered between two vacations, until the second vacation expires. If, however, the conditions required by this Article or by Article 308 to render an Officer eligible for Privilege Leave under the ordinary rules are subsequently fulfilled in respect of the second vacation, any Privilege Leave which may have been granted on half salary under Article 306 (b), in consequence of the presumption that the officer would avail himself of the vacation, may be commuted into Privilege Leave on full salary. Privilege Leave on full salary may be combined with Privilege Leave on half salary to the extent due, granted under Article 306 (b)].\n\n309. An officer who is, by general or special orders issued by competent authority, prevented from availing himself of a part only of a periodical vacation may, during Privilege Leave subsequently taken, draw his full salary for a period bearing the same proportion, if the vacation be annual, to a month, or if it be half-yearly, to half a month, as the time spent on duty during the vacation bears to the whole vacation.\n\n310. An Officer transferred from a department to which the ordinary Privilege Leave Rules apply, to one in which Articles 306 to 309 apply, loses all claim to take the Privilege Leave at his credit, provided that\u2014\n\n(i) Any Privilege Leave granted to him during the first three years after his transfer, under Articles 306 and 309, may, to the extent of the Privilege Leave at his credit as aforesaid, be leave on full salary not exceeding the salary which would have been admissible if he had taken the leave immediately before being transferred.\n\n(ii) If he returns to a department in which Privilege Leave is regulated by the ordinary rules, he shall be reckoned on such return to have at his credit the amount of Leave which was at his credit at the time of the first transfer, less any amount enjoyed under proviso (i).\n\n311. The reckoning under the preceding article shall not, in any case, extend backwards over an interruption of duty.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter XIII.\u2014Long Leave\u2014European Services.**\n\n**General.**\n\n330. The rules in this Chapter apply to\u2014\n\n(a) Members of the Indian Civil Service.\n\n(b) Military Officers subject to the Civil Leave Rules.\n\n(c) Officers belonging to one of the classes enumerated below and appointed thereto by Her Majesty's Secretary of State or with his particular sanction.\n\n**General.**\u2014Officers holding substantive appointments, such as are usually held by Members of the Indian Civil Service or Military Officers.\n\n**Land Revenue.**\u2014Officers of the Settlement Department above the rank of deputy Collector or extra Assistant Commissioner.\n\n**Opium.**\u2014Sub-Deputy Opium Agents and Officers of higher rank.\n\n**Customs.**\u2014Commissioner, Deputy Commissioner, and Collector of the Northern India Salt Revenue Department; Deputy and Assistant Commissioners of Sea Customs; Superintendent of Customs Preventive Service at Calcutta, and of the Salt Golahs at Sulkea, Assistant Collectors of Sea Customs in Bengal.\n\n**Forest.**\u2014Assistant Conservators and Officers of higher rank.\n\n**Registration.**\u2014Inspectors-General of Registration.\n\n**Post-Office.**\u2014Presidency Postmasters, Deputy Postmasters-General, and Officers of higher rank.\n\n**Telegraph.**\u2014Assistant Superintendents and Officers of higher rank.\n\n**General Administration.**\u2014Assistant and Under Secretaries to Government, and Officers of the Sixth and higher classes of the Financial Department.\n\n**Judicial.**\u2014Judges of the Chief Court of the Punjab (not being Barristers), Judges, and Registrars of Presidency Small Cause Courts, Civil Judges in Oudh, Magistrates of Police in Presidency Towns, Registrars of High Courts.\n\n**Police.**\u2014District Superintendents and Officers of higher rank.\n\n**Marine.**\u2014Port Officers, Deputy and Assistant Port Officers, and Officers of higher rank.\n\n**Educational.**\u2014Officers on the Graded List.\n\n**Medical.**\u2014Civil Medical Officers graded by the Notification in the Finance Department, No. 2,295, dated 25th April, 1867.\n\n**Political.**\u2014Assistant Political Agents.\n\n**Survey.**\n\n(i) Trigonometrical, Topographical, and Revenue. \u2014 Assistant Superintendents of Survey, and Officers of higher rank.\n\n(ii) Geological.\u2014Officers on the Graded List.\n\n**Indian Museum.**\u2014Superintendent and Deputy Superintendent.\nMeteorological.\u2014The Meteorological Reporter, and Assistant Meteorological Reporter, to the Government of India.\n\nStationery and Printing.\u2014Superintendent of Government Printing, Government Central Press, Calcutta.\n\nPublic Works.\u2014Assistant Engineers of the Third Grade and Officers of higher rank, Assistant Examiners of Accounts and Officers of higher rank.

(a) The Officers whose names are entered in Appendix No. 3 have also been admitted to the benefits of the Rules in this Chapter from the 3rd January, 1872, being the day on which the despatch from the Secretary of State, No. 451, dated 6th December, 1871, was received.\n\n332. It may be explained that the conditions precedent to the entry of the name of an Officer in Appendix No. 3 were that\u2014\n\n(i) He was not of purely Asiatic descent;\n(ii) He held substantively, on the 3rd January, 1872, one of the offices described in Article 330; and\n(iii) His salary, on the 10th February, 1876, was not less than six thousand rupees a year.\n\nFurlough.\n\n334. General Limitation.\u2014The amount of Furlough admissible to a Member of the Indian Civil Service, or a Military Officer subject to the Civil Leave Rules, and the aggregate amount of Furlough and of Special Leave with Allowances, admissible to any other Officer to whom these rules apply (see Article 330) is six years. All the rules in this part of the regulations are subject to this limitation.\n\n335. The following leave under other Rules is counted as Furlough under the preceding Article:\n\n(a) In the case of a Member of the Indian Civil Service:\u2014Furlough and Leave with Allowances on Medical Certificate under former Rules.\n\n(b) In the case of a Military Officer subject to the Civil Leave Rules:\u2014Furlough under Rules 1 and 6 of the Military Furlough and Leave Rules of 1875.\n\n(c) In the case of any other Officer to whom these Rules apply:\u2014Furlough and Leave with Allowances on Medical Certificate and Leave on private affairs under former Rules, or under the Indian Service Leave Rules.\n\n336. Leave after completion of Term of Service.\n\n(a) The limitations affecting Members of the Indian Civil Service, whose term of service is complete, are prescribed in Article 614, and those affecting Military Officers, in Article 689.\n\n(b) Any other Officer subject to the Rules of this Chapter, who is retained in the service after the age of fifty-five years, may, after attaining that age, be granted Privilege Leave, or any Special Leave (Article 348) to which he may be otherwise entitled, or Extraordinary Leave without Allowances under Article 366. The total leave granted, under the heads of Special or Extraordinary, must not exceed six months in all. To such an Officer no other kind of leave may be granted, and any leave, other than Privilege Leave or Special Leave, granted to such an Officer before the date on which he attains the age of fifty-five years, ceases to have effect on that date.\n\n337. The Amount of Furlough 'earned' by an Officer is one-fourth of his Active Service.\n\n338. (a) Provided that in making this calculation for an Officer promoted from the 'Indian Services,' only half of the Active Service rendered by him in offices other than those included in Article 330 shall be taken into account.\n\n1. The whole of the Active Service rendered by the Officer while officiating in any of the offices included in Article 330 is to be taken into account.\n\n(b) Provided also that a Military Officer subject to civil rules may, if he desire it, add to Furlough earned under civil rules an amount of Furlough in respect of his military service calculated as shown below. Such an Officer may be granted at any time any Leave which he has earned under civil rules, and may defer or forego the Leave he has earned under Military Regulations.\n\n(i) An Officer who, at the time of coming under Civil Leave Rules, was subject to the Military Furlough Regulations of 1868 or 1875, may be credited with the Furlough that may have accrued to him, less any Furlough already taken which, under those rules, would reduce the amount of Furlough due. The amount of Furlough accrued shall, in that case, be calculated proportionably on the whole service qualifying for Furlough, without reference to the minimum periods of service which those rules require to be rendered before Furlough can be granted.\n\n(ii) The service for Furlough of an officer whose case does not come under Clause (iii) of this Article, and who, at the time of coming under the Civil Leave Rules, was subject to the Leave Rules for the Staff Corps (1886), shall be calculated in accordance with Article 337 retrospectively from the date of his arrival in India; i.e., he shall be credited with an amount of Furlough equivalent to one fourth of his active service, less any leave out of India actually taken.\n\nNote.\u2014[When a Military Officer becomes subject to the Civil Leave Rules, the Military Department will, on application, and on being furnished with the date of commencement of Active Service, furnish to the Audit Officer, to whose audit such officer becomes subject, a memorandum showing the furlough earned, the different kinds of leave taken (distinguishing those which should be deducted from the maximum Furlough permissible), and the balance of Furlough due to him under Military Rules.]\n\n(iii) In the case of an officer who, before electing the Leave Rules for the Staff Corps (1886), was subject to the Military Furlough Regulations of 1868 or 1875, the amount of Furlough to be prefixed to Furlough earned under the Civil Leave Rules shall be calculated in the following manner:\u2014\n\n(a) For the period the officer was subject to the Military Furlough Regulations of 1868 or 1875, he shall be credited with Furlough calculated in accordance with Clause (i) of this Article;\n\n(b) for the period the officer was under the Leave Rules for the Staff Corps (1886), he shall be credited with Furlough\ncalculated in the manner described in Clause (ii) of this Article, except that the calculation shall be made from the date of coming under the Staff Corps Rules, instead of from the date of arrival in India.\n\n339. The Amount of Furlough 'due' to an Officer is the amount which he has 'earned,' diminished:\n\n(a) In the case of a Member of the Indian Civil Service:\n\n(i) By the Furlough which he has enjoyed under these or any former Rules, except Junior Furlough under the Rules in force before the 8th June, 1855;\n\n(ii) By the excess over one year in the amount of leave with allowances on medical certificate which he has enjoyed under former Rules.\n\n(b) In the case of a Military Officer subject to the Civil Leave Rules, by the Furlough which he has enjoyed under these Regulations. (See also Note to Article 338 (b).)\n\n(c) In the case of an Officer other than an Officer of the Indian Civil Service or the Army\u2014\n\n(i) By the Furlough, or Special Leave with allowances, which he has enjoyed under these or any other Rules;\n\n(ii) By the Leave on private affairs or on medical certificate with allowances, which he has enjoyed under the Rules formerly applicable to him.\n\nProvided that if more than two years' Furlough be due to an Officer when he first becomes subject to the Rules in this Chapter, the excess shall be cancelled.\n\n340. Furlough Admissible.\u2014To an Officer who has rendered three years' Continuous Service, Furlough for not more than two years may be granted, as follows:\n\n(a) On medical certificate,\u2014unconditionally; (see Articles 893 to 902.)\n\n(b) Without medical certificate,\u2014subject to these provisos:\n\n(i) That the Furlough be due to him;\n\n(ii) That he has rendered eight years' Active Service in Civil employ;\n\n(iii) If a Military Officer subject to the Civil Leave Rules, who has not rendered eight years' Active Service in Civil employ; and\n\n(1) If the Furlough which he applies for is his first Furlough\u2014that he has two years' Furlough due to him under the calculation in Article 338 (b); or\n\n(2) If the Furlough applied for be other than his first Furlough\u2014that he has rendered three years' Continuous Service since his return from Furlough;\n\n(iv) That the whole number of Officers absent on Furlough and Special Leave do not exceed the limit (if any) appointed by the Government of India (see Articles 341 and 342).\n\n341. Except, on medical certificate, or on very urgent private affairs, Furlough or Special Leave may not be granted to any Member of the Indian Civil Service, or to any Military Officer whether subject to the Civil or the Military Leave Rules, or to any other Officer who is, if employed in Oudh, the Central Provinces, Burma, Assam, Ajmir, Coorg, or Berar, a Member of the Commission, or who is, if employed elsewhere, the holder of an office corresponding to that of a Member of a Commission, if one-fifth of all the Officers of a Commission, or of all Officers holding appointments similar to those of Members of a Commission, as the case may be, are already absent on Furlough or Special Leave.\n\n342. (a) If under the operation of proviso (iv), Article 340, the applications for Furlough (including those under Article 264) cannot all be complied with, Furlough will be granted in the following order:\n\nFirst.\u2014To the applicant to whom most Furlough is due;\n\nSecondly.\u2014Of two or more applicants to whom the same amount is due; to him who has rendered longest Continuous Active Service;\n\nThirdly.\u2014Of two or more such applicants who have rendered the same Continuous Active Service\u2014to the Senior.\n\n(b) This Article refers to applications registered for a Furlough not yet vacant. The order of date in which such applications are made has no significance. The Article cannot affect applications made for a Furlough already vacant unless they happen to arrive by the same post.\n\n343. To an Officer who has not rendered three years' Continuous Service, Furlough for not more than one year may be granted on medical certificate.\n\n344. Extension of Furlough.\u2014(a) Furlough granted under Article 340 may, on medical certificate, be extended to not more than three years.\n\n(b) Furlough granted under Article 343 for less than one year may, on medical certificate, be extended to not more than one year.\n\n345. Ordinary Furlough can, under no circumstances, extend beyond two years at one time; it includes\u2014\n\n(i) The first two years of each separate period of Furlough under Article 340, including any extension under Article 344 (a);\n\n(ii) So much of Furlough under Article 343, including any extension under Article 344 (b) as may be due: Provided that the Officer has rendered six months' Continuous Active Service.\n\n346. Leave Allowances.\u2014An Officer on ordinary Furlough is entitled to a Leave allowance equal to half his average salary subject to the following limits:\n\n(a) In the case of a Member of the Indian Civil Service\u2014\n\n(i) If paid at the Home Treasury of the Government of India, maximum \u00a3250 a quarter, and minimum \u00a3125 a quarter, or his last salary, whichever is less;\n\n(ii) If paid in India, maximum Rs. 833\u00bd a month, and minimum Rs. 416\u00bd a month, or his last salary, whichever is less;\n\n(b) In the case of a Military Officer subject to the Civil Leave Rules, the same maxima and minima as in the case of a Member of the Indian Civil Service. Provided that, during Furlough added under Article 338 (b) to the Furlough earned under Civil Rules, the minimum shall (in the case of an Officer who became subject to the Civil Leave Rules, on or\nafter the 1st April, 1888) be that prescribed by the Military Rules to which the Officer was previously subject;\n\n(c) In the case of any other Officer subject to these Rules\u2014\n\n(i) If paid at the Home Treasury of the Government of India, maximum \u00a3200 a quarter; no minimum.\n\n(ii) If paid in India, maximum Rs. 666\u00bd a month; no minimum.\n\nProvided always that the allowances of an Officer during Leave shall in no case exceed his actual salary when he takes Leave.\n\n1. In the case of a Military Officer subject to the Military Leave Rules who takes subsidiary or preparatory leave before Furlough, the words \"prior to his proceeding on Furlough\" in Rule V of the Military Furlough Regulations of the 10th November, 1868 shall be understood to mean before he is relieved of his duties.\n\n2. An Officer on Furlough does not forfeit his past Leave allowances by resigning the service without returning to India.\n\nNote.\u2014[Absentee allowances in respect of Leave spent out of India, if paid in India, are subject to the Rupee limits prescribed in this Article.]\n\n347. An Officer on Furlough other than ordinary is entitled\u2014\n\n(i) If a member of the Indian Civil Service, or a Military Officer subject to the Civil Leave Rules, to subsistence allowance of the amount stated in Article 127, Rule 1.\n\n(ii) If an Officer not in the Indian Civil Service or in the Army, to \u00a3120 a quarter paid at the Home Treasury, or Rs. 400 a month paid in India, or to one-quarter of his average salary, whichever is less.\n\nNote.\u2014[Absentee allowances in respect of Leave spent out of India, if paid in India, are subject to the Rupee limits prescribed in this Article.]\n\nSPECIAL LEAVE.\n\n348. Special Leave on urgent private affairs may be granted at any time for not more than six months.\n\nProvided that an Officer who has had Special Leave must render six years' Active Service before he can again have such Leave.\n\n(1) The corresponding Leave under the Covenanted Civil Service Leave Rules in force before the 1st July, 1868, and Furlough under Rule XI of the Military Furlough Rules of 1868, are 'Special Leave' within the meaning of this proviso.\n\nNote.\u2014[A question having been raised in 1887 as to whether a Military Officer in Civil employ who is under Military Leave Rules of 1868, can take ordinary Furlough three years after return from his last Furlough, notwithstanding that he has during the three years' interval taken six months' Special Leave under the Civil Leave Rules, as allowed by Article 671 of these Regulations, the following rulings were made:\u2014\n\n(i) The period of three years required for Furlough is not broken by Special Leave intervening; but\n\n(ii) The Special Leave does not count as part of the three years;\n\n(iii) Special Leave is not included when counting the maximum eight years allowed for Furlough;\n\n(iv) Special Leave does not count as service for Furlough.]\n\n3. An Officer promoted from an office subject to the Indian Service Rules, is not debarred from obtaining Special Leave with allowances under the preceding Article, by reason of his having had Leave on Private Affairs under the Indian Service Leave Rules, which is Furlough in another form.\n\n350. Leave Allowances.\u2014(a) For the first six months for which an Officer is on Special Leave, whether the six months be included in the same leave or not, he is entitled to the leave allowance admissible under Article 346.\n\n(b) Thereafter he is entitled to no leave allowance.\n\n(i) The corresponding leave under the covenanted Civil Service Rules in force before the 1st July, 1868, is 'Special Leave' within the meaning of this Article.\n\n(c) An Officer on Special Leave does not forfeit his past leave allowances by resigning the Service without returning to India.\n\n351. A Military Officer in Civil employ, subject to the Military Furlough Rules of 1868, is entitled, during the first six months of his Special Leave under Article 348, to an allowance of half his average salary, subject to a maximum of \u00a31,000, and to a minimum of \u00a3250 a year. The title to this allowance is not affected by any leave previously taken under Rule XI of the Furlough Rules of 1868.\n\n351a. When an officer other than a member of the Indian Civil Service or the Army subject to the Rules in this Chapter is obliged to take long leave out of India owing to ill-health, absentee allowances are subject to the following minima:\u2014\n\nOn Ordinary Furlough or Special Leave\u2014\n\nWhen paid in England ... \u00a3200 a year, or 4ths of last salary, whichever is less.\n\nWhen paid in India ... Rs. 166\u00bd a month, or 4ths of last salary, whichever is less.\n\nOn Furlough other than Ordinary\u2014\n\nWhen paid in England ... \u00a3100 a year, or 37\u00bd per cent. of last salary, whichever is less.\n\nWhen paid in India ... Rs. 83\u00bd a month, or 37\u00bd per cent. of last salary, whichever is less.\n\nNote 1.\u2014[The minimum rate of Leave allowance prescribed in this Article is also admissible in the case of any Leave out of India commuted into Leave on medical certificate. An officer claiming the minimum rate must furnish a medical certificate in support of the claim. The certificate should be in the same form as that required by the Civil Service Regulations.]\nto entitle an Officer to Leave on medical certificate and should recommend Leave out of India.]\n\nNote 2. [For the purposes of this Article, Ceylon is not held to be \"out of India.\"]\n\nSubsidiary Leave.\n\n352. (a) Subsidiary Leave is the time allowed\u2014\n\n(i) To an Officer leaving India on retiring from the Service, or on Furlough or Special Leave to break up his domestic establishment and travel to the port of embarkation: and\n\n(ii) To an Officer returning to India from Furlough, or Special Leave, to travel from the port of debarkation and reorganise his domestic establishment.\n\n(b) The use of the words 'port of embarkation,' and 'port of debarkation' in Clause (a), limits the grant of Subsidiary Leave to an Officer leaving India by sea\u2014that is, at an Indian seaport. No Subsidiary Leave is admissible to an Officer who does not leave India by sea.\n\n353. (a) The grant to an Officer leaving India\u2014\n\n(i) Of permission to retire from the Service; or\n\n(ii) Of Furlough or Special Leave out of India, carries with it the grant of Subsidiary Leave, including, in the case referred to in Article 352 (a), Clause (ii), Subsidiary Leave on his return to duty.\n\n(b) An Officer returning to India, without the permission of the authority which granted him leave, more than fourteen days before the end of his Furlough or Special Leave, is not entitled to Subsidiary Leave, save under the special orders of the Local Government.\n\n354. Leave in and out of India.\u2014(a) An Officer (including a Military Officer subject to the Military Leave Rules) may take Furlough or Special Leave partly in and partly out of India. But Subsidiary Leave is not admissible unless the Furlough or Special Leave begins or, as the case may be, ends, as Furlough or Special Leave, out of India.\n\n(b) If an Officer going on Furlough or Special Leave out of India is prevented by sickness or other urgent and adequate reason not within his own control,\u2014such, for example, as the postponement of the departure of the vessel in which his passage is engaged,\u2014from embarking within his Subsidiary Leave, the Local Government may order that his Furlough or Special Leave shall begin in India at the end of the Subsidiary Leave otherwise admissible, without forfeiture of his Subsidiary Leave.\n\n355. Period admissible.\u2014The minimum Subsidiary Leave is ten days; otherwise Subsidiary Leave is calculated according to the rules and restrictions laid down in Chapter XI for 'Joining Time.'\n\n359. Beginning and End of Leave.\u2014Saving as provided in Article 354 (b), Furlough and Special Leave out of India begin on, and include, the day of the departure of the vessel in which the Officer sails, and if an Officer remains in India after the end of Subsidiary Leave, his Furlough or Special Leave dates from the beginning of his Subsidiary Leave, his Subsidiary Leave being thereby cancelled. Similarly Furlough and Special Leave out of India, end on, and include, the day before the arrival of the vessel in which the Officer returns, and Subsidiary Leave begins the day after.\n\nDefinition.\u2014The day on which the vessel in which the Officer sails quits her moorings or anchorage, whether she leaves the limits of the port or not on that day is the day of the departure of the vessel. The day of arrival of the vessel in which the Officer returns, is the day on which the vessel reaches her moorings or anchorage in port.\n\n360. Any Officer, serving in Persia or Turkish Arabia, may leave the country in which he is serving, or return to it by any port or frontier town. The date of his departure or return must be certified by the British Consul, or, if there be no British Consul, by the Officer himself.\n\n362. Leave Allowances.\u2014An Officer on Subsidiary Leave is entitled to allowance as follows:\u2014\n\n(a) If the leave be subsidiary to Special Leave and the Officer have had leave subsidiary to a former Special Leave:\u2014no allowance.\n\n1. The corresponding leave under the Covenanted Civil Service Rules in force before the 1st July, 1868, is Special Leave within the meaning of this Clause.\n\n(b) If the leave be subsidiary to Ordinary Furlough or Special Leave (otherwise than is provided in Clause (a)):\u2014the allowance admissible under Article 346, but calculated, in the case of a Member of the Indian Civil Service or a Military Officer subject to the Civil Leave Rules, without the limitations of maximum or minimum prescribed by Clauses (a) and (b) of Article 346. The limitations prescribed by Clause (c) of Article 346 apply to the allowances of any other Officer subject to this Article on Subsidiary Leave.\n\n(c) If the leave be subsidiary to Furlough other than Ordinary:\u2014the allowance admissible under Article 347.\n\n(d) If the Officer, under Article 261, have ceased to have a lien on a substantive appointment\u2014as, for example, if an Officer has been absent on Extraordinary Leave in extension of Furlough\u2014\n\n(i) In the case of a Member of the Indian Civil Service or a Military Officer subject to the Civil Leave Rules:\u2014Subsistence Allowance; and\n\n(ii) In the case of any other Officer subject to this Article:\u2014no allowance.\n\n(e) If the leave be preparatory to retirement:\u2014the allowances which would be admissible if the Officer were proceeding on Leave of such description as may be admissible to him; and if no leave is admissible:\u2014Subsistence Allowance only.\n\nNote.\u2014[See Note under Article 295.]\n\n363. An Officer may draw allowances as if he were on Privilege Leave, for any part of his Subsidiary Leave under Clause (i) of Article 352 (a) for which, if he were not retiring from the Service, or going on Furlough or Special Leave, Privilege Leave would be admissible to him. It is to be observed that an Officer who has no lien on an appointment cannot benefit by this Rule. (See Article 295.)\n\n364. Lien.\u2014An Officer on Subsidiary Leave under Clause (i) of Article 352 (a) has or has not a lien on an appointment according as he has or has not such lien on the first day of the Leave to which it is subsidiary.\nNote.\u2014[A Military Officer subject to the Military Leave Rules does not lose his lien during Subsidiary Leave preparatory to Furlough.]\n\n365. An Officer on Subsidiary Leave under Clause (ii) of Article 352 (a) has or has not a lien on an appointment, according as he has or has not such lien on the day last preceding the Subsidiary Leave.\n\nExtraordinary Leave.\n\n366. Subject always to the provisions of any Statute applicable to the case, the Local Government (or, if the Officer be on Furlough or Special Leave in Europe, the Secretary of State) may in case of necessity, and when no other kind of leave is by rule admissible, grant Leave of absence from duty otherwise than under these Regulations: Provided that\u2014\n\n(i) such Leave may not be granted in combination with the grant of other Leave. But it may be granted in continuation of other Leave if circumstances arise which prevent the return by the Officer to duty, and which, in the opinion of the Local Government, are such as to justify the concession. No Officer is entitled to Extraordinary Leave.\n\n(ii) an Officer absent from duty on Leave so granted shall receive no absentee allowance; and\n\n(iii) if he is a Member of the Indian Civil Service or a Military Officer subject to the Civil Leave Rules, he shall retain no lien upon any office.\n\nNote 1.\u2014[This Article does not refer to Casual Leave for short periods. Such Leave is not recognised and is not subject to any rule. Technically, therefore, an Officer on Casual Leave is not treated as absent from duty, and his salary is not intermitted. Casual Leave, however, must not be given so as to cause evasion of the rules regarding\u2014\n\n(i) Date of reckoning allowances\n\n(ii) Charge of office\n\n(iii) Commencement & end of Leave\n\n(iv) Return to duty\n\n(see Articles 64 to 70),\n\n(see Articles 251 to 263),\n\nor so as to extend the term of Privilege or other Leave beyond the time admissible by rule.]\n\nNote 2.\u2014[The following is an extract from the Secretary of State's Despatch No. 279 (Financial), dated 4th December, 1890, regarding the grant of Extraordinary Leave:\u2014\n\n4. \"The Local Government is the proper judge, at the time when an Officer on duty applies for Extraordinary Leave without pay, whether the circumstances are such as to justify the concession. If, however, the Officer applies, in the first instance, for Leave under the Rules, Extraordinary Leave should not at the time be conceded in combination therewith; if subsequent circumstances render it necessary for him to ask for an extension which is not authorised by the Rules, it is for the Local Government or the Secretary of State, as the case may be, to decide whether sufficient reason is shown.\n\n5. \"With regard to your remark that cases not unfrequently arise in which it is very desirable to have the power of granting Extraordinary Leave without restrictions of any kind, I desire to express my opinion that with the liberal provision of Leave which is granted by the Rules, such cases ought to be very rare. Extensions by the grant of Extraordinary Leave are seldom allowed in this country, except in such cases as those of * * * * to which you refer, where family circumstances of an unforeseen character or illness may have occurred, rendering a short prolongation of the Officer's absence almost indispensable.\"]\n\n366a. A Military Officer subject to the Civil Leave Rules, who has exhausted the full period of Furlough admissible to him under these Regulations, and who is granted Extraordinary Leave on medical certificate, will continue to be treated as wholly in civil employ for all purposes, with the exception that, if the Medical Board at the India Office report that there is no prospect of the Officer returning to duty within a reasonable period, he will be placed on military half-pay. If an Officer thus placed on half-pay is afterwards permitted to revert to the effective list, and returns to duty in India, he will not be entitled to be reinstated in civil employment, but will be posted to civil or military duty as may be decided in India.\n\nChapter XIV.\u2014Long Leave\u2014Indian Services.\n\n367. The rules in this chapter apply to all Officers who are not entitled to Leave under the other chapters of these Regulations. They apply fully only to those Officers whose pay is not less than 100 rupees a month, and who have substantive appointments on permanent establishments under the Government.\n\n368. (a) Leave may, however, be granted under this chapter to an Officer whose pay is less than 100 rupees, so far as it can be done without imposing any cost upon the State. The Absentee Allowance of the substantive incumbent must not exceed what remains from the pay of the appointment after provision is made for the efficient discharge of his duties during his absence. No leave in excess of the Leave admissible under these rules may be granted to such an Officer, with allowances, or counting as service for pension.\n\n(b) This article authorises the grant of Leave upon the condition therein stated, not only to an Officer in Superior service whose pay is less than a hundred rupees a month, but to an Officer whose service is treated as Inferior under the Pension Rules, upon the condition that the grant of the Leave shall not impose any cost upon the State.\n\n369. Leave on medical certificate may be granted for three years in all, but not for more than two years at one time; and no Officer can have Leave on medical certificate out of India more than twice.\n\n370. Leave on Private Affairs for six months may be granted to an Officer who has not had Furlough, after six years' service, and repeated after intervals of six years.\n\n1. Leave on Private Affairs does not accumulate, and cannot be taken in instalments.\n2. Leave on Medical Certificate counts as service for Leave on Private Affairs.\n\n371. Furlough may be granted as follows:\n\n(a) After ten years' service, one year or any less period, and thereafter at intervals of not less than eight years, one year, or such other period as together with all periods already spent in Furlough may not exceed two years; or\n\n(b) After eighteen years' service, two years or any less period, and thereafter at intervals of not less than eight years, one year, or any less period.\n\nProvided that the service for Furlough of an Officer who has had Leave on Private Affairs counts only from the date of his last return from such leave;\n\nProvided also that the aggregate amount of Furlough or of Furlough and Leave on Private Affairs taken together shall not exceed two years.\n\n1. Leave on Medical Certificate counts as service for Furlough.\n\n2. Leave on Private Affairs under the Rules in force before the 8th June, 1863, does not prevent the grant of Furlough under this Article.\n\n372. Extraordinary Leave without allowances may, in case of necessity, and when no other leave is by rule admissible, be granted for such time as may be necessary. Time spent on Leave under this Article does not count as service for other Leave. Subject to the provisions of Article 222, there is no limit to the length or frequency of Leave under this Article. It may not be granted in combination with the grant of other Leave; but it may be granted in continuation of other Leave if circumstances arise which prevent the return by the Officer to duty, and which in the opinion of the Local Government, or the authority empowered to grant the Leave, are such as to justify the concession. No Officer is entitled to Extraordinary Leave.\n\n373. Leave Allowances.\u2014(a) An Officer on Leave on medical certificate under Article 369 is entitled to half his average salary for the first fifteen months of each period of absence, but not for more than thirty months in all. For the rest of his Leave under Article 369 he is entitled to a quarter of his average salary.\n\n(b) An Officer on Furlough or on Leave on Private Affairs is entitled to half his average salary.\n\n374. (a) Half 'average salary' is always subject to a maximum of Rs. 500 a month if paid in India, and \u00a3150 a quarter if paid at the Home Treasury of the Government of India.\n\n(b) One quarter 'average salary' is always subject to a maximum of Rs. 400 a month if paid in India, and \u00a3120 a quarter if paid at the Home Treasury of the Government of India.\n\n(c) For non-gazetted Officers whose salary is not less than Rs. 300, the minimum of 'half average salary' is Rs. 150, and, of one quarter average salary, is Rs. 75 a month.\n\nNote 1.\u2014[Absentee allowances in respect of Leave spent out of India will, if paid in India, be subject to the Rupee limits prescribed in this Article.]\n\n374A. When an Officer subject to the Rules in this Chapter is obliged to take leave out of India under Articles 369, 370, or 371, owing to ill-health, half average salary and quarter average salary are subject to the following minima:\n\nHalf average salary\u2014\n\nIf paid in England ... \u00a3200 a year or 4ths of last salary, whichever is less.\n\nIf paid in India ... Rs. 166\u00bd a month, or 4ths of last salary, whichever is less.\n\nQuarter average salary\u2014\n\nIf paid in England ... \u00a3100 a year, or 37\u00bd per cent. of last salary, whichever is less.\n\nIf paid in India ... Rs. 83\u00bd a month, or 37\u00bd per cent. of last salary whichever is less.\n\nNote 1.\u2014[The minimum rate of Leave allowance prescribed in this Article is also admissible in the case of any Leave out of India commuted into Leave on medical certificate. An Officer claiming the minimum rate must furnish a medical certificate in support of the claim. The certificate should be in the same form as that required by the Civil Service Regulations to entitle an Officer to Leave on medical certificate and should recommend Leave out of India.]\n\nNote 2.\u2014[For the purposes of this Article, Ceylon is not held to be \"out of India.\"]\n\n375. All the rules in Article 373 are subject to the proviso that the allowances of an Officer during Leave shall in no case exceed his actual salary when he takes Leave.\n\n376. An Officer does not forfeit the allowances to which he is entitled under Articles 373 to 375 by resigning the service at the end of the Leave.\n\n377. Leave after Fifty-five years of age.\u2014An Officer in superior service who is subject to the Rules of this chapter is eligible, after he attains the age of fifty-five years, for Privilege Leave, for any Leave on Private Affairs (Article 370) to which he may be otherwise entitled, and also for Leave without allowances under Article 372, provided that the total Leave granted, whether on private affairs or without allowances, does not exceed six months in all, and for no other kind of Leave. Any Leave, other than Privilege Leave or Leave on Private Affairs, granted to such an Officer before the date on which he attains the age of fifty-five, ceases to have effect on this date.\n\nSubsidiary Leave.\n\n378. An Officer going on or returning from Leave out of India on Medical Certificate, Leave on Private Affairs, or Furlough, or going on or returning from Leave on Medical Certificate to a Sanitarium, is entitled to Subsidiary Leave under the Rules in Chapter XIII., Articles 352 and 354 to 359, and the grant of such Leave carries with it the grant of Subsidiary Leave including, as in the cases referred to in Article 352 (a) Clause (ii), Subsidiary Leave on his return to duty.\n\n379. Subsidiary Leave on half-pay for a period not exceeding fourteen days may be given to an Officer preparatory to leaving India by sea, on retirement from the Service, provided that the grant causes no additional expense to the State.\n380. (a) An Officer on Subsidiary Leave prefixed to other Leave is entitled to half his average salary. But he may draw allowances as if he were on Privilege Leave, for any part of this Leave for which, if he were not going on leave out of India, Privilege Leave would be admissible to him.\n\n(b) An Officer on Subsidiary Leave following other Leave is entitled to half his average salary, or one quarter of his average salary, according to the rate of allowance to which he may be entitled at the end of the Leave to which it is subsidiary.\n\nPART IV.\u2014ORDINARY PENSIONS.\n\nCHAPTER XV.\u2014GENERAL RULES.\n\n381. The conditions of service of Officers of the following classes include special rules for Pension which are laid down in the chapters noted against each, viz.:\u2014\n\n(a) Judges of the High Courts (see Chapter XXIII.).\n\n(b) Barristers holding the appointments of Judge of the Chief Court of the Punjab, First Judge of the Small Cause Courts in Presidency towns, Recorder of Rangoon, and Secretary to the Government of India in the Legislative Department (see Chapter XXIV.).\n\n(c) Members of the Indian Civil Service (see Chapter XXV.).\n\n(d) Statutory Civil Servants (see Chapter XXVI.).\n\n(e) Ecclesiastical Officers (see Chapter XXVII.).\n\n(f) Civil Engineers and Telegraph Officers (see Chapter XXIX.).\n\n(g) State Railway Establishments (see Chapter XXXI.).\n\n(h) Bengal Covenanted Pilots and their families (see Chapter XXXII.).\n\n(i) Police Officers drawing less than Rs. 20 a month (see Chapter XX.).\n\n(j) Port Blair Police (see Chapter XXXIII.).\n\n382. The Pensions of all other Officers are regulated by the rules in this Part. Provided that it is open to a Local Government to rule that the service of any class of officers serving under it does not qualify for pension.\n\n383. Future good conduct is an implied condition of every grant of a pension. The Government reserves to itself the right of withholding or withdrawing a pension, if the pensioner be convicted of serious crime or be guilty of grave misconduct.\n\nCASES IN WHICH CLAIMS ARE INADMISSIBLE.\n\n384. In the following cases, no claim to pension is admitted:\u2014\n\n(a) When an Officer is appointed for a limited time only, or for a specified duty, on the completion of which he is to be discharged.\n\n(b) When a person is employed temporarily on monthly wages without specified limit of time or duty; but a month's notice of discharge should be given to such a person, and his wages must be paid for any period by which such notice falls short of a month.\n\n(c) When a person's whole time is not retained for the public service, but he is merely paid for work done for the State.\n\n1. This clause applies, among others, to the following officers:\u2014Advocate General, Solicitor to Government, Government Pleaders and Law Officers not debarred from private practice, Sheriffs in Presidency Towns, Coroners, Roman Catholic Priests.\n\n(d) When a public servant holds some other pensionable office he earns no pension in respect of an office of the kind mentioned in clause (c) or in respect of duties paid for by a Local Allowance.\n\n(e) When an Officer serves under a covenant which contains no stipulation regarding pension, unless the Government of India specially authorises an Officer to count such service towards pension.\n\n385. Pension may not be granted to an Officer whom it is desired to remove for misconduct, insolvency, or inefficiency.\n\n386. Claims of Widow.\u2014(a) It being the duty of every Government Officer himself to provide for his family, the Government recognises no claim by a widow on account of the services of her husband, and is almost invariably under the painful necessity of rejecting recommendations made in contravention of this rule.\n\n(b) The submission of such recommendations, save under very extraordinary circumstances, is disapproved, as calculated only to give rise to hopes which cannot be fulfilled.\n\n387. Limitations.\u2014(a) An Officer cannot earn two pensions in the same office at the same time, or by the same continuous service:\u2014\n\nExample.\u2014A soldier who obtains his discharge from the Army under Exception (4) in Article 388 is not entitled to any pension in the Military Department for the portion of his military service which he will thereupon count as civil service.\n\n(b) Two Officers may not simultaneously count service in respect of the same office.\n\n388. Military Service.\u2014Service which is pensionable under Military Rules does not count; and an Officer who is counting service for Military Pension cannot simultaneously count service for Civil Pension,\u2014for example, an Officer of the old Indian Navy in civil employ cannot count his naval service.\nCHAPTER XVI.\u2014CONDITIONS OF QUALIFYING SERVICE.\n\nBEGINNING OF SERVICE.\n\n390. (a) Except for compensation gratuity, an Officer's service does not in the case of superior service qualify till he has completed twenty years of age.\n\n(b) In other cases, unless it be otherwise provided by special Rule or Contract, the service of every Officer begins when he takes charge of the office to which he is first appointed.\n\nNote.\u2014[In every covenant with an Officer appointed in England by the Secretary of State, not being a Member of the Indian Civil Service or a Civil Engineer or Telegraph Officer educated at the Royal Engineering College, Cooper's Hill, or a Forest Officer, a clause is inserted to the effect that service for leave and pension begins only from the date on which the Officer joins his first appointment in India.]\n\n391. The following exceptions are admitted to the Twenty Years' Rule:\u2014\n\n(i) The officers described in Articles 446 and 703. All Officers appointed in England by the Secretary of State for service in India; and 'Indian College Engineers' (see Article 690 (f)), and Police probationers appointed in India under the orders contained in the despatch of the Secretary of State No. 14 (Judicial), dated 15th March, 1894, are exempt from this disability.\n\nCONDITIONS OF QUALIFICATION.\n\n393. The service of an Officer does not qualify for pension unless it conforms to the following three conditions:\u2014\n\nFirst. The service must be under Government.\n\nSecond. The employment must be substantive and permanent.\n\nThird. The service must be paid by Government.\n\nThese three conditions are explained in the following sections:\u2014\n\n394. First Condition.\u2014The service of an Officer does not qualify unless he is appointed and his duties and pay are regulated by the Government, or under conditions determined by the Government.\n\n395. Second Condition.\u2014Service does not qualify unless the Officer holds a substantive office on a permanent establishment: but, upon such conditions as it may think fit in each case to impose, the Government of India may allow temporary service to count for pension, if the pension does not exceed ten rupees a month.\n\n396. An establishment, the duties of which are not continuous, but are limited to certain fixed periods in each year, is not a temporary establishment. Service in such an establishment, including the period during which the establishment is not employed, qualifies; but the concession of counting as service the period during which the establishment is not employed, does not apply to an Officer who was not on actual duty when the establishment was discharged, after completion of its work, or to an Officer who was not on actual duty on the first day on which the establishment was again re-employed.\n\n397. An Officer transferred from a temporary to a permanent appointment can count his service in the temporary office, if, though at first created experimentally, or temporarily, it eventually becomes permanent.\n\n398. An Officer without a substantive appointment officiating in an office which is vacant, or the permanent incumbent of which does not draw any part of the pay or count service, may, if he is confirmed without interruption in his service, count his officiating service.\n\n399. The service of a probationer who holds a substantive office, and draws substantive pay, qualifies. So does that of an Officer who is on probation for a substantive office, if he is employed in a vacancy reserved for him, pending probation, and in which no other Officer simultaneously counts service.\n\n400. Police probationers and temporary and officiating Assistant Superintendents of Police in all provinces count their service towards pension, provided they have passed their examinations, have served two years in the Department, and have attained the age of 20 years. The restrictions in this Article do not apply to Police probationers recruited in England after competitive examination, or in India under the orders contained in the despatch of the Secretary of State No. 14 (Judicial), dated 15th March, 1894. Probationers recruited in England after competitive examination count their service from the date of reporting their arrival in India; those recruited in India under the orders above quoted count their service from the date of taking charge of the office to which they are first appointed.\n\n401. Third Condition.\u2014Service which satisfies the conditions prescribed in Sections II and III qualifies, or does not qualify, according to the source from which it is paid; with reference to this article service is classified as follows:\u2014\n\n(a) Paid from General Revenues.\n\n(b) Paid from Local Funds.\n\n(c) Paid from funds in respect of which the Government holds the position of trustee.\n\n(d) Paid by fees levied by law, or under the authority of the Government, or by Commission.\n\n(e) Paid by the grant, in accordance with law or custom, of a tenure in land, or of any source of income, or right to collect money.\n\n402. Service paid from the General Revenues qualifies. The fact that arrangements are made for the recovery on the part of the Government of the whole or part of the cost of an establishment or Officer, does not affect the operation of this principle: Provided that the establishment or Officer is appointed, controlled, and paid by the Government.\n\n403. Service paid from a Local Fund qualifies, or does not qualify, according to the rules laid down in Chapter XXXVIII. (Service under Local Funds).\n\n404. Trust Funds.\u2014Service paid from funds which Government holds only as a trustee, such as under a Court of Wards or in an Attached Estate, does not qualify.\n\n405. Fees and Commission.\u2014(a) Service in an office paid only by fees, whether levied by law or under the authority of Government, or by a commission, does not qualify.\n\n(b) Service in an office paid by fees or by commission, in addition to pay from the General Revenues, qualifies.\nCHAPTER XVII.\u2014RULES FOR RECKONING SERVICE.\n\nSPECIAL ADDITIONS.\n\n441. For the purpose of calculating the amount of pension ordinarily admissible to an Officer, not being a Native of Asia, whose qualifying service began after 25 years of age, and whose service for which pension is claimed amounts to not less than ten years and has been passed wholly in one or other of the following offices, three years shall be added to the qualifying service:\u2014\n\n(i) Directors of Public Instruction.\n(ii) Inspectors of Schools.\n(iii) Principals and Professors of Colleges.\n(iv) Headmasters of Colleges and High Schools.\n\n441A. Subject to the restriction specified against the first three sets of offices, an incumbent of one of the offices enumerated below, appointed on account of professional or other special qualifications, whose whole pensionable service has been passed in one or other of such offices, shall, if appointed at an age exceeding 25, be entitled to reckon as service qualifying for superannuation pension (but not for any other class of pension) the number of completed years by which his age may, at the time of appointment, have exceeded 25 years, subject to the proviso that five years shall be the maximum period which can be so added.\n\n1. Deputy Legal Remembrancership, Bengal.\n2. Presidency Magistracy.\n3. Judgeship of the Small Cause Court at a presidency Town (other than the Chief Judgeship) and at Rangoon.\n\nNote.\u2014[Mr. G. C. Kilby, the present incumbent of the appointment of Deputy Legal Remembrancer, Bengal, is entitled to the concession in Article 441, if he retires on a pension other than a superannuation pension.]\n\n4. The office of Astronomer at Madras.\n5. The office of Director of the Colaba Observatory.\n\n443. A period not exceeding one year of pensionable service is added to the service of any specially deserving Officer who, during employment on Famine Duty in Madras in 1877-78, received no extra allowance for such duty and whose total salary during such duty did not exceed Rs. 600 a month.\n\nPERIODS OF LEAVE.\n\n445. Superior Service.\u2014(a) Time passed on leave in India other than Privilege or Subsidiary Leave does not count as Superior Service. Time passed on leave subsidiary to leave on medical certificate by an Officer subject to the Indian Service Leave Rules, who has twice before had leave on medical certificate out of India, does not count.\n\n(b) This article applies to leave on medical certificate taken even before 1856, notwithstanding that such leave was reckoned as service under the Rules in Appendix No. 5.\n\n445A. Time passed on leave with allowances out of India counts as service as follows:\n\nIf the service of the Officer He counts as service is not less than a period not exceeding\n\n| Years | Service |\n|-------|---------|\n| 15    | 1 year  |\n| 25    | 2 years |\n\nNote 1.\u2014[Total service in this Article means total service reckoning from the date of commencement of service qualifying for pension and includes periods of leave.]\n\nNote 2.\u2014[For the purposes of this Article, Ceylon is not held to be 'out of India.']\n\n446. But the Officers noted below count leave with allowances out of India as service as follows:\n\nIf the total service of the Officer He counts as service is not less than a period not exceeding\n\n| Years | Service |\n|-------|---------|\n| 20    | 2 years |\n| 25    | 3      |\n| 30    | 4      |\n| 35    | 5      |\n\nIf the Officer's service is not less than 15 years, he counts as service a period not exceeding one year spent on leave with allowances out of India.\n\n(a) Graded Officers of the Geological Survey Department.\n\n(b) Officers of the Forest Department specially trained in Europe under regulations made by the Secretary of State, or who have been specially admitted to the benefit of this Article.\n\nNote 1.\u2014[Total service in this Article means total service reckoning from the date of commencement of service qualifying for pension and includes periods of leave.]\n\nNote 2.\u2014[The addition of the words \"out of India,\" after the word \"allowances,\" in the first line of this Article, has effect from the 16th October, 1894, and leave taken in India after that date, or in the case of Officers admitted after that date, to the benefit of this Article at any time, does not count.\n\n452. Deputation out of India.\u2014When an Officer is deputed out of India on duty, the whole period of his absence from India counts. When an Officer on leave out of India is detained on duty, the period of such detention counts.\n\n453. When, on the recommendation of the Government of India, an Officer of the Public Works Department on furlough in Europe is employed in England, by the Secretary of State, on the inspection of stores for India, the period of such employment counts.\n\n454. Recall to duty.\u2014Time spent on the voyage to India by an Officer who is recalled to duty before the expiry of any recognised leave, and (if, within a year from the date on which he can be spared, the Officer takes the unexpired portion of the leave from which he was recalled), the time spent on the return voyage to Europe counts.\n\nSUSPENSIONS, RESIGNATIONS, BREAKS, AND DEFICIENCIES IN SERVICE.\n\n458. (a) Time passed under Suspension pending inquiry into conduct counts, if the suspension is immediately followed by reinstatement.\n\n(b) Time passed under suspension adjudged as a specific penalty does not count.\n460. Resignations and Dismissals.\u2014(a) Resignation of the Public Service, or removal from it for misconduct, insolvency, inefficiency, or failure to pass a prescribed examination, entails forfeiture of past service.\n\n(b) Resignation of an appointment to take up another appointment, service in which counts, is not held to be a resignation of the public service.\n\n461. Any authority who, on revision or appeal, reverses an order dismissing an Officer, may declare that the past service of the reinstated Officer counts.\n\n463. An interruption in the service of an Officer entails forfeiture of his past service, except in the following cases:\n\n(a) Authorised Leave of Absence,\n\n(b) Unauthorised absence in continuation of authorised leave of absence, so long as the office of the absentee is not substantively filled; if his office is substantively filled the past service of the absentee is forfeited:\n\nProvided that, if the absentee is subsequently reinstated, the authority whose duty it is to make the appointment, within three months, or, the Local Government, within one year, from the end of the authorised leave of absence, may declare, in an order to be communicated to the Audit Officer, that his previous service, or any part of it, shall not be forfeited.\n\n(c) Suspension immediately followed by reinstatement, which need not be to the same office.\n\n(d) Abolition of office or loss of appointment owing to reduction of establishment.\n\n(e) Transfer to non-qualifying service in an establishment under Government control. The transfer must be made by competent authority; an officer who voluntarily resigns qualifying service, cannot claim the benefit of this exception. Transfer to a grant-in-aid school entails forfeiture.\n\n(f) Transfer to service on the household establishment of the Viceroy.\n\n(g) Loss of appointment owing to the Mutiny, provided that the Officer affected cleared his character, and was re-appointed as soon as a suitable vacancy was found for him.\n\n(h) Time occupied in transit from one appointment to another, provided that the Officer is transferred under the orders of competent authority, or, if he is a non-gazetted Officer, with the consent of the head of his old office.\n\n464. The Local Government may commute retrospectively periods of absence without leave into leave without allowances.\n\n465. Condonation of Interruptions and Deficiencies.\u2014Upon such conditions as may think fit, in each case, to impose\u2014\n\n(i) The Government of India may condone all interruptions in service not exceeding twelve months in all; and the Local Government may condone all interruptions not exceeding three months in all.\n\n(ii) If the proposed pension does not exceed fifty rupees a month, the Government of India may condone interruptions in service, whatever their duration; and the Local Government may exercise the same power if the pension is a provincial charge; otherwise it may condone interruptions not exceeding twelve months in all.\n\n465A. (1) Upon any conditions which it may think fit to impose, the Government of India, or if the pension be a Provincial charge, the Local Government, may, in all cases, condone a deficiency of three months in qualifying service. If the pension is an Imperial charge, the Local Government may not condone a deficiency of more than one month.\n\n(2) (a) If, besides his qualifying service, an officer has rendered service (actual) paid from the General Revenues, but not counting for pension, or, if an officer claiming a pension for Superior service has also rendered Inferior service, the Government of India, or, if the pension be a Provincial charge, the Local Government, may condone a deficiency in the officer\u2019s qualifying service not exceeding half his non-qualifying or, as the case may be, Inferior service, and, also, not exceeding twelve months in all.\n\n(b) If the pension is an Imperial charge, the Local Government may, in these cases, condone a deficiency not exceeding one-fourth the officer\u2019s non-qualifying, or, as the case may be, Inferior service, and, also, not exceeding three months.\n\nNote.\u2014[The two clauses of this section are alternative and not cumulative.]\n\nChapter XVIII.\u2014Conditions of Grant of Pension.\n\nClassification of Pensions.\n\n466. Pensions for Superior Service are divided into four classes, the rules for which are prescribed in the following sections of this chapter:\n\n(a) Compensation Pensions\u2014see Section II.\n\n(b) Invalid Pensions\u2014see Section III.\n\n(c) Superannuation Pensions\u2014see Section IV.\n\n(d) Retiring Pensions\u2014see Section V.\n\nCompensation Pension.\n\n468. A Compensation Pension is awarded to an Officer discharged from the public service because, on a reduction of establishment, his appointment is abolished, and other suitable employment cannot be found for him. An appointment, the pay of which is reduced as part of a general scheme of revision, is abolished within the meaning of this article.\n\n469. To pension an Officer still capable of useful service is a waste of public money; before a pension is granted to such an Officer discharged on abolition of appointment, it must be carefully considered whether he cannot be otherwise provided for.\n\nInvalid Pension.\n\n485. An Invalid pension is awarded, on his\nretirement from the public service, to an Officer who by bodily or mental infirmity is permanently incapacitated\u2014\n\n(i) For the public service, or\n\n(ii) For the particular branch of it to which he belongs.\n\n486. Rules regarding Medical Certificates.\u2014If an Officer applying for an Invalid pension is sixty years old or upwards, no certificate by a Medical Officer is necessary; it suffices for the head of the office to certify to the incapacity of the applicant. Otherwise incapacity for service must be established by a Medical Certificate.\n\n488. Medical Officers must not give a certificate that inefficiency is due to old age or natural decay from advancing years, to any Officer whose age is less than 55 years. In the case of any Officer whose age is less than 55 years, the cause of inefficiency must be exactly stated.\n\n489. Form of Medical Certificate in England.\u2014The form of the medical certificate given by the Medical Board attached to the India Office, respecting an Officer applying for pension in England, is as follows:\n\nCertified that we have carefully examined A. B. of the Indian * * *. His age is, by his own statement ( ) years; and by appearance about ( ) years. Looking at all the facts of his case and his present condition, we consider that he is so far incapacitated for further service in India that we recommend that he be permitted to retire from the service of Government on pension. So far as we are in a position to judge, his incapacity has not been occasioned by irregular or intemperate habits.\n\nNote.\u2014[If the incapacity is obviously the result of intemperance substitute for the words in italics: 'In our opinion his incapacity is the result of irregular or intemperate habits.]\n\n496. Restrictions.\u2014An Officer discharged on other grounds has no claim under Article 485, even although he can produce medical evidence of incapacity for service.\n\n498. If the incapacity is the result of irregular or intemperate habits, no pension can be granted. Otherwise it is for the Local Government to decide whether the Officer's incapacity is such as to render it necessary to admit him to Invalid pension.\n\n499. Applicant to be Discharged.\u2014An Officer who has submitted under Article 486 a Medical Certificate of incapacity for further service, must not (except for special reasons to be reported to the Local Government) be retained in active service pending a decision on his application for pension, nor can he obtain leave of absence, except subsidiary leave preparatory to retirement. Without the further special sanction of the Local Government, service after the date of a Medical Certificate does not count for pension.\n\n500. The object of the preceding article is to discourage tentative applications.\n\n501. Article 499 refers only to the retention in active service of an Officer who has furnished a medical certificate in support of an application for invalid pension or gratuity while in India. The retirement of an Officer who is absent on leave other than Privilege Leave, when such certificate is submitted, may have effect from the termination of his leave, and the Officer may continue to draw leave allowance to the end of his leave.\n\nSuperannuation Pension.\n\n502. A Superannuation Pension is granted to an Officer entitled or compelled, by Rule, to retire at a particular age.\n\n503. (a) An Officer in Superior service who has attained the age of fifty-five years may be required to retire, unless the Local Government considers him efficient, and permits him to remain in the Service. But, as the premature retirement of an efficient Officer imposes a needless charge on the State, this Rule should be worked with discretion. And in cases in which the rule is enforced, a statement of the reasons for enforcing it shall be placed on Record by the Local Government or other competent authority.\n\n505. Officers in the Survey of India, of rank not lower than that of Assistant Surveyor, shall cease to be in employment on attaining the age of fifty-five years, unless specially permitted by the Secretary of State, in the interests of the public service, to remain in the Department for a further definite period.\n\n508. Optional Retirement at Fifty-five.\u2014An Officer in Superior Service, who has attained the age of fifty-five years, may, at his option, retire from the Service on a Superannuation pension.\n\nRetiring Pension.\n\n509. A Retiring Pension is granted to an Officer who voluntarily retires after completing qualifying superior service for thirty years or such less time as may for any special class of officers be prescribed.\n\n510. No Officer may retire with the view of being re-employed, whether in the General Service or in service paid from an Incorporated Local Fund and drawing pension in addition to pay.\n\n511. An Officer holding two or more separate appointments may not, save with the express sanction of the Government of India in the Finance Department or, if pensions are a provincial charge, of the Local Government, resign one or more of such appointments on a pension, without retiring from the Public Service altogether. There is no objection to his being relieved from one or more of such appointments at any time, without being compelled to leave the service altogether, but in such case any pension admissible to him for service in the office or offices from which he is relieved will be deferred until he finally retires.\nGeneral Rules.\n\n512. The amount of pension that may be granted is determined by length of service, as set forth in Articles 518 to 529. Fractions of a year are not taken into account in the calculation of any pension admissible to an Officer under this part of these regulations.\n\n513. Currency.\u2014A pension is fixed in rupees, and not in sterling money, even though it is to be paid in England.\n\n514. (a) The full pension admissible under the Rules is not to be given as a matter of course, or unless the service rendered has been really approved.\n\n(b) If the service has not been thoroughly satisfactory, the Local Government should make such reduction in the amount of pension as it thinks proper.\n\n515. Limitations.\u2014An Officer entitled to pension may not take a gratuity instead of pension.\n\n517. An Officer, not being a Military Officer or a Member of the Indian Civil Service, transferred to service under a Colonial Government, on final retirement from the Colonial service on pension or compensation allowance receives, at the charge of the Indian Revenues, for each completed year of qualifying and uninterrupted service in India, a pension of one-sixtieth of his average emoluments at the time of his transfer, such average emoluments to be calculated for the last five years, or, if the whole service in India is less than five years, for the whole period of service. The pension is subject to a maximum limit of Rs. 2,000 a year for an Indian service not exceeding ten years, and Rs. 4,000 a year in any other case. (The sanction of the Government of India is required to the transfer of an Officer to any service of the description mentioned in this article.)\n\nAmount of Superior Pension.\n\n518. The amount of a pension is regulated by the length of service, as follows:\n\n(a) After a service of less than ten years a gratuity not exceeding (except in special cases and under the orders of the Government of India) one month's emoluments for each completed year of service. If the emoluments of the Officer have been reduced during the last five years of his service otherwise than as a penalty, average emoluments may, at the discretion of the Local Government, be substituted for emoluments.\n\n(b) After a service of not less than ten years a pension not exceeding the following amounts:\n\n| Years of completed service | Scale of Pension | Maximum limit of Pension |\n|---------------------------|-----------------|-------------------------|\n|                           |                 |                         |\n| 10                        | 10-sixtieths of average emoluments | 2,000                     |\n| 11                        |                 | 2,000                   |\n| 12                        |                 | 2,400                   |\n| 13                        |                 | 2,600                   |\n| 14                        |                 | 2,800                   |\n| 15                        |                 | 3,000                   |\n| 16                        |                 | 3,200                   |\n| 17                        |                 | 3,400                   |\n| 18                        |                 | 3,600                   |\n| 19                        |                 | 3,800                   |\n| 20                        |                 | 4,000                   |\n| 21                        |                 | 4,200                   |\n| 22                        |                 | 4,400                   |\n| 23                        |                 | 4,600                   |\n| 24                        |                 | 4,800                   |\n| 25 & above                |                 | 5,000                   |\n\nNote.\u2014[For the precise meaning of average emoluments, see Articles 530 and 531 of this chapter.]\n\n519. In the following cases the several prescribed maxima limits of Rs. 2,000 to Rs. 5,000 prescribed in the preceding Article may be relaxed:\n\n(a) For an Officer whose average emoluments exceed Rs. 10,000 a year, and who entered the Service before the 19th May, 1855, or whose salary before the 6th August, 1862, exceeded Rs. 10,000 a year, the maximum pension is ordinarily Rs. 5,000 a year. But if the service of such an Officer has been of extraordinary merit, a pension exceeding Rs. 5,000 a year may be recommended for the sanction of the Secretary of State.\n\n(b) To an Officer who entered the Service before the 19th May, 1855, but whose average emoluments do not exceed Rs. 10,000 a year, the Secretary of State, on the recommendation of the Government of India, sometimes grants a special pension in excess of the prescribed maximum, for unusually meritorious services.\n\n(c) For a Native Judge (see Part I. of Appendix No. 5) who was in the Service on the 29th October, 1866, the limit is ordinarily Rs. 5,000 a year.\n\nNote.\u2014[The limits which may be relaxed under the foregoing Rules are the maxima money limits, and not the limits of from ten to thirty-sixtieths of 'average emoluments' referred to in the preceding Article.]\n\n520. An Invalid Pension on the following Scale, but not being less than Rs. 1,000 or more than Rs. 2,000 a year, may, if it is more favourable than the above, be granted\u2014\n\n(i) To a graded Officer of the Geological Survey Department.\n\n(ii) To an Officer of the Forest Department specially trained in Europe under regulations made by the Secretary of State, or who has been specially admitted to the benefit of this Article:\n\nIf the qualifying service of the Officer be not less than\u2014 Forty-fifth part of the Officer's average emoluments.\n\n| 10 years | ... | ... | 10 |\n| 11 \"    | ... | ... | 11 |\n| 12 \"    | ... | ... | 12 |\n| 13 \"    | ... | ... | 13 |\n| 14 \"    | ... | ... | 14 |\n\n521. Reduction in Certain Cases.\u2014(a) A superannuation pension, or an invalid pension granted on account of incapacity for further service due to old age or natural decay from advancing years, shall, if the Officer's qualifying service began after the 20th January, 1871, and after he attained the age of thirty years, be reduced by one-fortieth for every year or part of a year by which his age at the commencement of his qualifying service exceeded thirty years.\n\nNote 1.\u2014[Article 521 (a) is not applied in calculating the second pension of an officer who is re-employed after discharge on compensation pension, or gratuity.]\nNote 2.\u2014[The amount of pension under this Article is now $P \\left( \\frac{70-X}{40} \\right)$ where $P$ is the full pension and $X$ is the age at entry into service (and therefore greater than 30).]\n\nNote 3.\u2014[In the case of Jail Officers of the Bombay Presidency who, previously to joining the Jail Department, had served in the army, the limit of age for the purpose of this Article has been fixed at 38 years.]\n\nNote 4.\u2014[Port officers in Madras are exempt from the operation of this Article.]\n\nNote 5.\u2014[This article does not apply to the officers subject to the rule in Article 441A.]\n\n(b) Gratuities are not subject to any reduction; and in the case of pensions the fixed limits are to be applied before, and not after, making the reduction.\n\n523. In the case of an Officer whose qualifying service began after he attained the age of thirty years, the attention of the Examining Medical Officer should always be called to Article 521 (a) in order that he may adapt his certificate accordingly.\n\nALLOWANCES RECKONED FOR PENSION.\n\n530. The term emoluments when used in this part of the regulations means the emoluments which the Officer was receiving immediately before his retirement, and include\u2014\n\n(a) Pay;\n(b) Personal allowance;\n(c) Fees or commission, if they are the authorised emoluments of an appointment, and are in addition to pay. In this case \u2018emoluments\u2019 means the average earnings for the last six months of service;\n(d) Charge Allowance to Signallers in the Indian and Indo-European Telegraph Departments;\n(e) Commission in the case of a Thugyi in Lower Burma, \u2018emoluments\u2019 in this case being held to mean the average of his monthly receipts in commission during the five years' actual service previous to retirement: but see example (3) under Article 533.\n\n(f) Bullock Train and Punjab Military Horse Van Dak allowance in the Post Office Department;\n(g) Allowances attached to a Minor Professorship in a Medical College under the Medical Warrant of 1867;\n(h) Allowance attached to a Professorship or Lectureship in a Government Institution;\n(i) Acting allowances of an Officer without a substantive appointment if the acting service counts under Article 406, and allowances drawn by an Officer appointed provisionally or substantively pro tempore to an office which is substantively vacant and on which no Officer has a lien, or to an office temporarily vacant in consequence of the absence of the permanent incumbent on leave without allowances, or on transfer to foreign service.\n\n531. The term average emoluments means the average calculated upon the last five years of service.\n\n1. If, during the last five years of his service, an officer has been absent from duty on leave with allowances, or, having been suspended, has been reinstated without forfeiture of service, his emoluments, for the purpose of ascertaining the average, should be taken at what they would have been had he not been absent from duty or suspended: Provided always that his pension must not be increased on account of increase in pay not actually drawn. But if his absence on half-pay during recess is reckoned as service under Article 447, only the allowances actually received during the recess should be taken into account.\n\n533. Any part of an Officer\u2019s pay or emoluments, which is specially intended to provide for expenses incidental to his duty, must be excluded.\n\nChapter XX contains Special Rules for the Police, and Chapter XXI relates to the Re-employment of Pensioners.\n\nPART V.\u2014RULES APPLICABLE TO SPECIAL DEPARTMENTS OR SPECIAL OFFICERS.\n\nChapter XXII.\u2014The Governor-General, Governors, Lieutenant-Governors, and Members of Council.\n\n589. The following is the Statute Law applicable to the Governor-General, Governors, and Members of Council who hold or enjoy pensions:\u2014\n\n\u2018Provided always and be it enacted, that if any Governor-General, Governor, or Ordinary Member of the Council of India, or any Member of the Council of any Presidency, shall hold or enjoy any pension, salary, or any place, office, or employment of profit under the Crown, or any public office, or the said Company (East India Company), or any annuity payable out of the Civil or Military Fund of the said Company, the salary of his office of Governor-General of India, Governor, or Member of Council, shall be reduced by the amount of the pension, salary, annuity, or profits of office so respectively held or enjoyed by him.\u2019\u2014(3 & 4 Will. 4, cap. 85, s. 77.)\n\n590. If an Ordinary Member of Council hold or enjoy any pension or any annuity payable out of the Civil or Military Fund, the salary of his office of Member of Council is to be reduced under Acts 3 & 4 Will. 4, cap. 85, s. 77, by the amount of the pension or annuity held by him. A good service pension enjoyed by Military Officers comes within the meaning of pension under the Act cited above.\n\n591. Lieutenant-Governors.\u2014(a) Leave on medical certificate for not more than six months\nmay be granted to a Lieutenant-Governor. On resuming his duties after such leave, a Lieutenant-Governor is entitled to half his salary for the period of his absence. If he is prevented from resuming his duties, he is entitled to no Absentee Allowances.\n\n(b) A Lieutenant-Governor is not entitled to any other leave.\n\nNote.\u2014[A member of the Indian Civil Service, on resignation of the office of Lieutenant-Governor, is entitled to subsidiary leave preparatory to retirement under the ordinary rules.]\n\n593. Members of Council.\u2014The tenure by a Member of Council of his office begins when he takes upon himself the execution of his office, and the resignation of his office by a Member of Council whose successor has not entered upon his office, takes effect from the day following that of his embarkation at any port in India, excluding Aden, or from the expiry of his five years' tenure of office, whichever date is earlier.\n\n594. The leave admissible to an ordinary Member of the Executive Council of the Governor-General, or of the Governor of Madras or Bombay, is regulated by Statute 24 & 25 Vic., cap. 67, s. 26, as follows:\n\nSection 26.\u2014It shall be lawful for the Governor-General in Council, or Governor in Council of either of the Presidencies, as the case may be, to grant to an ordinary Member of Council Leave of Absence, under medical certificate, for a period not exceeding six months, and such Member, during his absence, shall retain his office, and shall, on his return and resumption of his duties, receive half his salary for the period of such absence; but, if his absence shall exceed six months, his office shall be vacated.\n\nNote.\u2014[A member of the Indian Civil Service, on resignation of the office of Member of Council, is entitled to subsidiary leave preparatory to retirement under the ordinary rules.]\n\n595. Subject to any special orders by the Government of India to the contrary, Leave of Absence granted to an ordinary Member of the Council of the Governor-General (if taken out of India) commences on the day after such Member embarks at any port in India, excluding Aden, and ends on the day before he disembarks at any port in India, excluding Aden: Provided always that such Member has not been relieved of the charge of his office until he embarks, and that he resumes charge immediately upon his disembarkation.\n\nChapter XXIII.\u2014Judges of the High Courts.\n\nStatutory Rules.\n\n600. The following Rules made under Statute 24 & 25 Vic., cap. 104, sec. 6, by the Secretary of State in Council of India, regulate the salaries, allowances, furloughs, retiring pensions, and (when necessary) expenses for equipment and voyage of the Chief Justices and Judges of the several High Courts established under the said Statute. They have effect from the 11th May, 1891.\n\nNote.\u2014[The headings (other than those of Sections), which are introduced to facilitate reference, are not included in the statutory rules.]\n\nDefinitions.\n\n1. In these Rules, unless there is something repugnant in the subject or context,\n\nAppointments.\n\n\u2018Acting Chief Justice\u2019 means a Judge appointed under sec. 7 of Statute 24 & 25 Vic., cap. 104, to perform the duties of Chief Justice of a High Court.\n\n\u2018Acting Judge\u2019 means a person appointed under the said sec. 7 to perform the duties of Judge of a High Court.\n\n\u2018Judge\u2019 includes a Chief Justice and Acting Chief Justice, and an Acting Judge, except where the contrary is expressed.\n\nActual Service.\n\n\u2018Actual Service\u2019 includes,\u2014\n(a) Time spent by a Judge on duty as Judge, or in the performance of such other functions as he may be directed to discharge by the Governor-General of India in Council;\n(b) Time spent by a Judge on privilege or subsidiary leave;\n\n(c) Duly authorized vacations (provided that the Judge is not absent on furlough or on extraordinary leave under Rule 26).\n\nSection I.\u2014Salaries.\n\n2. The Chief Justice, or Acting Chief Justice, of the High Court at Calcutta, shall be paid a salary at the rate of Rs. 72,000 per annum.\n\n3. The Chief Justice, or Acting Chief Justice, of the High Courts of Madras and of Bombay, and for the North-Western Provinces respectively, shall be paid a salary at the rate of Rs. 60,000 per annum.\n\n4. A Judge, or Acting Judge, of the High Courts at Calcutta, Madras, and Bombay, and for the North-Western Provinces respectively, shall be paid a salary at the rate of Rs. 45,000 per annum: provided always that every Judge of the High Court at Calcutta appointed before the 18th day of January, 1881, shall be paid a salary at the rate of Rs. 50,000 per annum.\n\nSection II.\u2014Leave.\n\nFurlough earned.\n\n5. One year's furlough shall be placed to the credit of each Judge after the completion of the fourth, eighth, and twelfth years of actual service.\n\nMaximum Furlough.\n\nProvided that the aggregate amount of all furlough which can during the whole period of his service be granted to a Judge shall not exceed three years; provided further, that the maximum amount of furlough which may be taken at any one time is fifteen months.\n\nFurlough Admissible.\n\n6. Except under Rules 8 and 9, no Furlough shall be granted until at credit under Rule 5.\nBut any Judge already in the service of the Government at the time of being appointed to the High Court, who, when so appointed, was entitled, under the rules applicable to the branch of the service to which he belonged, to Furlough without Medical Certificate, may be granted Furlough for a term not exceeding that to which he was so entitled: Provided that such Furlough shall not be taken until the completion of two years' actual service in the High Court, and shall not exceed one year.\n\nCondition of Grant.\n\n7. Except under Rules 8 and 9, Furlough shall not be granted until after the completion of three years' actual service from the date of the last return from Furlough or from Extraordinary Leave.\n\n8. Under Medical Certificate Furlough may be granted before it is at credit under Rule 5, and although three years' actual service may not have been completed since the last return from Furlough or from Extraordinary Leave.\n\n9. On urgent private affairs, Furlough may be granted to a Judge before it is at credit under Rule 5, and although three years of actual service have not been completed since the last return from Furlough or Extraordinary Leave: Provided that Furlough under this Rule shall not exceed six months, and shall be granted only once during the whole period of a Judge's service.\n\nCommencement and End of Furlough.\n\n10. Furlough taken in India shall be reckoned from the date on which the Judge quits his office to the date of his resuming duty.

For the interval between the date of quitting his office and the commencement of Furlough out of India, and between the termination of Furlough out of India and resuming his office, a Judge may be allowed Subsidiary Leave not ordinarily exceeding thirty days, which in special cases may be extended.\n\nLeave Allowances.\n\n13. A Judge, when on Furlough, shall receive allowances at the rate of Rs. 833-5-4 a month, if the Furlough be taken in India, and at the rate of \u00a31,000 a year, if the Furlough be taken out of India and payment be made in England. A Judge, when on Subsidiary Leave, shall receive allowances at the rate of Rs. 833-5-4 a month.\n\nNumber of Furloughs Admissible.\n\n14. Except under Medical Certificate, the number of Furloughs to be granted at any one time, and the grant of Furlough to individual Judges, shall be subject to and limited by the exigencies of the service, which exigencies shall be determined exclusively by the authority with whom rests the question of granting the Furlough.\n\n15. Applications for Furlough not supported by Medical Certificate shall be granted usually in the following order:\n\nThe Judge who has the greatest amount of Furlough to his credit under Rule 5 shall have the preference. If two or more applicants are on an equality in this respect, preference shall be given to the applicant whose actual service in a High Court is longest, reckoning, in the case of a Judge who has not taken Furlough or Extraordinary Leave, from the date of his commencement of service in the High Court and in the case of a Judge who has taken Furlough, Subsidiary, or Extraordinary Leave, from the date of his last return from such Furlough or Extraordinary Leave. If two or more applicants are equal in both the above-mentioned respects, the preference shall be given to the senior in the Court.\n\nPrivilege Leave\u2014Present Rules.\n\n16. Subject to the exigencies of the public service, a Judge who has completed eleven months' continuous duty, including the Vacation, may take Privilege Leave for one month in each year, but, except as provided in Clause (a), his salary will cease during such Leave. A Judge may not take Privilege Leave in instalments, or more than a month at a time; and except as provided in Clause (b), Privilege Leave may not be combined with Vacation.\n\n(a) A Judge who has been detained on duty as Vacation Judge may, provided that he has not in the meantime had any furlough or leave of any kind, during his next subsequent privilege leave draw his Salary for any period not exceeding one month in the whole by which his Vacation may, by reason of his being detained on duty, have fallen short of one month.\n\n(b) Once in three years, and not oftener, Privilege Leave may be prefixed or affixed to the Vacation.\n\nPrivilege Leave\u2014Special Rules.\n\n17. Rule 16 does not apply to the following Judges:\n\nSir T. Muthuswami Aiyar,\nK.C.I.E. ...................... Madras.\nBayley, L. H. .................. Bombay.\nPrinsep, H. T. ................. Calcutta.\nSargent, Sir C., Knt. ......... Bombay.\n\n18. Privilege Leave may be granted to any of the Judges named in Rule 17, under the following Rules:\n\n(1) Subject to the exigencies of the public service Privilege Leave for one month may be granted to a Judge who has been on duty without interruption for eleven months, including the Vacation.\n\n(2) An additional Month of Privilege Leave accrues to a Judge after each further period of eleven months' continuous duty, including the Vacation.\n\n(3) Privilege Leave may not be taken in instalments, but any balance of Privilege Leave not taken when due may be added to the next Privilege Leave which accrues: Provided that the Privilege Leave taken at one time shall not exceed three months, and that any accumulation of Privilege Leave beyond that period shall be forfeited.\n(4) Save as provided in the next succeeding Clause (5), a Judge when on Privilege Leave shall receive half his salary.\n\n(5) A Judge who discharges the duties of Vacation Judge during the whole or any part of a Vacation, shall be entitled, for each day of such duty, to draw his full salary for one day of any Privilege Leave which he may subsequently obtain.\n\nPrivilege Leave\u2014Declaration.\n\n19. Every Judge applying for Privilege Leave must sign a Declaration that he intends to return to duty on the expiration of the Leave applied for, and that he has no intention of resigning his office or retiring from the Service, or taking leave of any kind, within three months after his return to duty. Such declaration shall not be held absolutely to debar the person making it from applying for permission to resign his office or to retire from the Service, or to take leave, within three months after his return to duty; but every such application must be accompanied by an explanation of the special circumstances under which it is made, and it shall be in the absolute discretion of the Government to grant or withhold the permission sought.\n\nCommutation of Leave.\n\n20. Furlough and Privilege Leave shall not be taken as such, in continuation of each other; but if a Judge absent on leave of one of these kinds is allowed to change it for Leave of the other kind, the whole period of his absence shall be held to be under Leave of the latter kind.\n\nApplications for Leave.\n\n21. Applications for Leave shall in all cases be submitted in such manner as the Government shall, from time to time, prescribe.\n\nPayment of Leave Allowances.\n\n22. Leave allowances shall be payable monthly if payment is made in India, and quarterly if in England.\n\nNote.\u2014[Leave allowance is now paid monthly in arrear, if payment is made in England.]\n\nEffect of Leave on Substantive Appointment, &c.\n\n23. No substantive appointment shall be vacated, merely by reason of Leave being granted under these Rules.\n\n24. If a Judge overstays any Leave he shall forfeit all salary during the time of his remaining so absent; and if he overstays his leave for more than one week, his office shall be liable to be declared vacant. But a Judge on Leave (other than Leave under Rules 16 or 18) is not obliged to return to duty on an authorised holiday, unless another Officer is officiating as Judge in consequence of his absence. Vacation is not an authorized holiday within the meaning of this Rule; and a Judge whose furlough terminates at the commencement of or during a vacation shall not be entitled to full pay for any part of the period of such vacation (except a part subsequent to his return to duty). If, after the termination of his furlough, he remains absent during the whole or any part of a vacation, he will, for such period of absence, draw the leave allowances admissible under Rule 13, but the time will count as actual service, not as furlough, provided that he returns to duty immediately at the end of the vacation.\n\nEffect on Pensionary Service.\n\n25. No Leave except Privilege Leave and Leave Subsidiary to Furlough shall count as service for Pension.\n\nExtraordinary Leave.\n\n26. If the Government shall in its discretion deem it necessary, in any special instance, to grant to any Judge Leave of Absence which is not expressly provided for in the foregoing Rules, such Leave shall be without pay: Provided always that in no case shall such Leave exceed six months, or be granted more than once in the whole course of the Judge's service.\n\nLeave under this Rule is termed 'Extraordinary' Leave.\n\nSection III.\u2014Pensions.\n\nChief Justices.\n\n27.

A Chief Justice of the High Courts at Madras and Bombay, and for the North-Western Provinces, respectively, after an actual service of fourteen and a half years as Judge of a High Court, of which period at least seven years shall have been as Chief Justice, shall receive a pension not exceeding \u00a31,500 per annum.\n\nJudges.\n\n29. A Judge of a High Court, not being a Native Judge, and not being eligible for pension at a higher rate under Rule 27 or 28, shall, after an actual service of fourteen and a half years as Judge, receive a pension not exceeding \u00a31,200 per annum.\n\n30. A Chief Justice or Judge shall, after an actual service of ten years, receive a pension according to the following graduated table:\n\n| Years of Actual Service | 1. Chief Justice, Calcutta | 2. Chief Justice Madras and elsewhere | 3.

A Chief Justice or Judge who retires on medical certificate after six years and nine months' actual service, shall receive a pension not exceeding, in the case of a Chief Justice of the High Court at Calcutta, \u00a3700 per annum; in the case of the Chief Justice of any other High Court, \u00a3600 per annum; and in the case of a Judge of a High Court, \u00a3500 per annum.\n\nPrevious Service.\n\n32. In the event of a Judge receiving a pension under these Rules, he will not be entitled to any other pension or retiring allowance.\n\n33. When a Judge, who at the time of his appointment to a High Court was a member\nof one of the Government Services in India, is permitted to retire without a pension under the preceding rules he shall receive such a pension as he might receive under the rules applicable to the branch of the Service to which he belonged when so appointed, reckoning the period of his service as a Judge of a High Court towards service for that pension.\n\n34. If a Judge who, at the time of his appointment to a High Court, was a member of one of the Government Services in India, shall be permitted to retire on medical certificate after six years and nine months of actual service as Judge, he shall have the option of taking his pension or retiring allowance either under these Rules or under the Rules applicable to the branch of the Service to which he belonged when appointed.\n\nCivil Servants.\n\n35. No Judge, selected from the Indian Civil Service, shall receive any pension under these Rules unless he shall have fully complied with all the rules and regulations in force for the time being as to payments to be made by him as a member of the Indian Civil Service on account of the provision for his own pension or retiring allowance, and for pensions to his wife and children.\n\nTransfer to another High Court.\n\n36. If a Judge be transferred from one High Court to another, the period he shall have served in each Court shall count towards his qualification for pension.\n\nPromotion to be Chief Justice.\n\n37. If a Judge be appointed to be a Chief Justice in the Court in which he has theretofore served, or in another Court, the period of his service as Judge will count for pension according to the rate of a Judge's pension, and the period of his service as Chief Justice will count for pension according to the rate of pension of a Chief Justice of the Court to which he may have been appointed.\n\n38. If a Chief Justice of the High Court at Madras, at Bombay, or for the North-Western Provinces be appointed Chief Justice of the High Court at Calcutta, his period of service in the Court from which he is transferred will count for pension according to the rate of pension of a Chief Justice of that Court, and his period of service as Chief Justice of the High Court at Calcutta will count for pension according to the rate of pension of a Chief Justice of the High Court at Calcutta.\n\n39. A Judge appointed under Statute 24 & 25 Vic., cap. 104, sec. 7, to perform the duties of Chief Justice, is not a Chief Justice within the meaning of these Rules as to pension: Provided that, if such Judge be afterwards appointed to be a Chief Justice, the period during which he performed the duties of Chief Justice as afore-said shall count as service for pension, at the rate of \u00a31,500 or of \u00a31,800 per annum, as the case may be: Provided also, that the period during which a Judge performs (under section 7 of the Statute 24 & 25 Vic., cap. 104) the duties of Chief Justice of the High Court at Calcutta shall not count towards pension at a rate exceeding \u00a31,500 a year, unless such Judge is subsequently appointed to the office of Chief Justice of the said High Court at Calcutta.\n\n40. These Rules numbered respectively 1 to 26 inclusive and 34 to 39 inclusive shall apply to every Chief Justice and Judge now holding office, as well as to those who may be hereafter appointed. Rules 27 to 33 inclusive shall not apply to any Chief Justice or Judge now holding office, who shall not before the 1st day of January, 1892, give notice to the Government of India that he elects to come under the operation of the said last-mentioned Rules in lieu of the Rules under which he may be now serving.\n\nN.B.\u2014The Rules referred to in the last line of this rule will be found in Appendix No. 29A of these Regulations.\n\nSection IV.\u2014Expenses for Equipment and Voyage.\n\n41.

But no such allowance shall be made to any person who, being in India, is appointed to the office of the Chief Justice or Judge, or who, having been in India, is in Europe at the time of his appointment with the intention of returning to India.\n\n601. Reversion to the General Service.\u2014(a) An Officer subject to the Rules of any of the other Chapters of these Regulations who has for a time been removed from the operation of such Rules by reason of officiating as Judge of the High Court, shall, on return to general service, have to his credit the same amount of service towards Privilege Leave as was at his credit when he began to officiate as High Court Judge.\n\n(b) In addition to this, he is entitled to count towards Privilege Leave, under the Rules to which he is subject, any period that has elapsed since he last obtained Privilege Leave or enjoyed vacation as High Court Judge, which he could have counted for Privilege Leave as a High Court Judge, if his officiating service had been prolonged until leave became admissible under the Rules applicable to Judges of the High Court.\n\n602. If a Judge, who is a Member of the Indian Civil Service, or a Statutory Civil Servant, shall be permitted to resign his office and remain in the service, all leave which he may have taken as a Judge of the High Court shall be reckoned as if it had been taken under the Rules for the leave of absence of Members of the Indian Civil Service or Statutory Civil Servants, as the case may be.\nCHAPTER XXIV.\u2014BARRISTER APPOINTMENTS.\n\n603. No Civil Officer, whether a Member of the Indian Civil Service or otherwise, is entitled to any special privileges by reason of his being a Barrister, unless, on his first admission to the service, he is appointed to some office in which the Local Government, with the sanction of the Government of India, has declared it to be necessary on public grounds to employ a Barrister.\n\nNote.\u2014[See Clause (5) of Article 441 in Chapter XVII.]\n\n1.

The amount of furlough earned by a Bishop is one-eleventh of the time during which he has been on duty: Provided that no additional furlough can be earned by duty done while six months' furlough is due. The furlough due to a Bishop is the furlough which he has earned less the period during which he has been absent on furlough.\n\n6. To a Bishop who has been on duty without interruption for thirty-three calendar months, and who has not for twelve calendar months been absent on furlough, the whole or any part of the furlough due to him may be granted.\n\nNote.\u2014[For the purposes of this rule, leave on medical certificate is, and furlough is not, an interruption of duty.]\n\n7. Furlough and leave on medical certificate cannot be taken in continuation of each other; but furlough granted under these rules may be retrospectively changed into leave on medical certificate.\n\nActing allowance of locum tenens.\n\n8. An Archdeacon or a Chaplain appointed to hold charge of a diocese during the absence of the Bishop is entitled to an allowance of Rs. 500 a month in addition to the pay of his substantive office.\n\nAbsentee Allowance.\n\n9.

The allowances of the Bishop of Madras or Bombay, when performing the functions of the Bishop of Calcutta during his absence on leave, are regulated by 5 & 6 Vic., cap. 119. In such case the Bishop of Madras or Bombay is entitled to an allowance at the rate of Rs. 833-5-4 per mensem in addition to his salary as Bishop of Madras or Bombay, and the Bishop of Calcutta will receive, during such absence, the salary of his office less Rs. 833-5-4 per mensem.\n\nGrant of Leave.\n\n12. Leave under these Rules may be granted to the Metropolitan by the Governor-General in Council, and to the Bishops of Madras and Bombay by the Governments of those Presidencies, on the recommendation of the Metropolitan.\n\n633. A Bishop of Madras or Bombay exercising the episcopal jurisdiction and functions appertaining to the See of Calcutta during a vacancy of the See by the demise of the Bishop thereof for the time being, or otherwise, is entitled to the full pay fixed for the office, viz., Rs. 3,831-6-8.\n\n634. The Statutory Rules in Article 632 do not apply to the Bishops of Rangoon or Lahore, whose official status is that of a Senior-Chaplain, and who, as such, are subject to the Rules prescribed for Chaplains, Articles 637 to 664 of this Chapter.\n\nChaplains.\n\n637. (a) Residence and Service.\u2014Residence (or Active Service) is reckoned, in the case of a Chaplain appointed in England, from the date of his arrival in India; and, in the case of a Chaplain who is appointed while resident in India, from the date on which he takes charge of his office. It includes\u2014\n\n(i) Time spent on duty.\n(ii) Privilege and Subsidiary Leave.\n(iii) Time passed out of employ in India, otherwise than on leave.\n(b) A Chaplain who is appointed while resident in India must not take charge of his office before the despatch appointing him is received in India. His service cannot count before the date of such receipt.\n\n(c) 'Service' includes 'Residence,' and, also, all Time spent on Leave of any description; but no time before the beginning of 'Residence.'\n\n638. Date of arrival in India.\u2014A Chaplain is held to have arrived in India on the date on which he reports his arrival either at the headquarters of the Diocese to which he is attached, or at any other Station to which he may be appointed, and to which he may proceed direct.\n\n639. (a) A Chaplain on the Bengal Establishment, who is posted in England to the Lahore Diocese or to any Station in the Central Provinces, or north of Allahabad, who comes to India via Bombay, or by direct steamer to Karachi, and who is instructed by the Secretary of State to inquire from the Secretary to the Government of Bombay, or at Karachi, from the Commissioner in Sindh, for orders as to his ultimate destination, is held to have arrived in India on the date on which he reports his arrival at the Station to which he is directed to proceed in the orders he receives at Bombay, or at Karachi, if he travels by direct steamer to that port.\n\n(b) A Chaplain, who is not on the Bombay Establishment, and who is not posted to any Station in the Lahore Diocese or to any Station in the Central Provinces or north of Allahabad, but who comes out to India via Bombay, is held to have arrived in India from the date on which he reports his arrival at the Presidency town of the Presidency to which he is attached, or, if he receives orders at Bombay to proceed to any particular Station, from the date of his arrival at that Station.\n\n(c) The report of arrival in each instance is to be made to the Bishop of the Diocese to which the Chaplain is attached.\n\n640. Chaplains are divided into two grades:\n\n1. Senior Chaplains, on Rs. 800 a month.\n2. Junior Chaplains, on Rs. 500 a month.\n\nThe pay of each grade is personal, hence a Junior Chaplain succeeding a Senior Chaplain in a particular charge is not entitled to any acting allowance.\n\nA Chaplain appointed after the 25th June, 1891, is required to serve on probation for a term of three years on a pay of Rs. 400 a month. At the end of that period he will be confirmed in the service as a Junior Chaplain, if reported fit by a Medical Board in India, and if his conduct and character are approved by the Bishop of the Diocese in which he is serving. Time spent in India on service under the Additional Clergy Society, or on other approved service, may be included in the period of probation. With the exception of such service probationary service counts towards leave and gratuity. Chaplains, however, appointed after 7th March, 1892, can count all probationary service towards pension also.\n\nNote.\u2014[A Clergyman must have been three years in priest's orders before his nomination as a probationer.]\n\nLeave.\u2014A Chaplain on probation is not entitled to any leave during his probation, except privilege leave under Article 656.\n\n644. The amount of Furlough 'admissible' to a Chaplain is limited to six years. All the Rules in this Section are subject to this limitation.\n\nFurlough and Leave with Allowances on medical certificate under former Rules are counted as furlough under this Rule.\n\n645. The amount of Furlough 'earned' by a Chaplain is one-fourth of his Active Service, and three months in addition thereto.\n\n646. The amount of Furlough 'due' to a Chaplain is the amount which he has earned, diminished by\u2014\n\n(i) The amount of Furlough which he has enjoyed under these or any former Rules;\n(ii) The excess over one year in the amount of leave with allowances on medical certificate which he has enjoyed under former Rules.\n\n647. (a) To a Chaplain who has rendered three years' Continuous Service, Furlough for not more than two years may be granted as follows:\u2014\n\nFirst. On medical certificate, unconditionally (see Chapter XL., Articles 893 to 902, for the Procedure Rules).\n\nSecondly. Without medical certificate, subject to the following provisos:\u2014\n\n(i) That the Furlough be due to him;\n(ii) That he have rendered seven years' Active service;\n(iii) That the whole number of Chaplains absent on Furlough and Special Leave do not exceed the limit appointed by the Government of India. Except on medical certificate or on very urgent private affairs, Furlough or Special Leave may not be granted to a Church of England Chaplain if twenty per cent. of the whole number of Chaplains belonging to his Diocese are already absent on Furlough or Special Leave. The Bishop of Calcutta will report to the Government of India when the limit is reached, and the Bishops of Lucknow, Lahore, or Rangoon, as the case may be, to their respective Local Governments.\n\n(b) Furlough taken under this Article may, on medical certificate, be extended to not more than three years.\n\n(c) The Furlough of a Chaplain is strictly limited to a period of three years at one time, and cannot be extended even without allowances. But the Secretary of State for India reserves to himself the power of allowing a Chaplain to remain in Europe beyond three years, should special and exceptional circumstances require it.\n\n648. (a) To a Chaplain who has not rendered three years' Continuous Service, Furlough for not more than one year may be granted on medical certificate.\n\n(b) Furlough granted under this Article for less than one year, may, on medical certificate, be extended to not more than one year.\n\n649. Furlough Allowances.\u2014(a) A Chaplain on Furlough is entitled to allowances as follows:\u2014\n\n| On ordinary Furlough | On other Furlough |\n|----------------------|------------------|\n| Archdeacon of Calcutta, Madras, or Bombay, and the Senior Chaplain of the Church of Scotland at the same places | \u00a3600 a year \u00a3480 a year |\n| Senior Chaplains     | \u00a3500             |\n| Junior Chaplains     | \u00a3350             |\n\n\"...\" indicates continuation of the list.\n(b) To a Chaplain proceeding on Furlough to England an advance of the first quarter's allowances may be made, which advance is not recoverable in the event of his death.\n\n(c) Ordinary Furlough includes\u2014\n\n(i) The first two years of each separate period of Furlough under Article 647.\n\n(ii) So much of Furlough under the preceding Article (648) as may be due, provided that the Chaplain have rendered six months' Continuous Active Service.\n\nA Chaplain on Furlough or Special Leave does not forfeit his past Leave Allowance by resigning the Service without returning to India.\n\n650. An Archdeacon of Rangoon or Lahore draws no extra 'Furlough Allowance' by reason of his office as Archdeacon.\n\n651. Special Leave on urgent private affairs may be granted at any time for not more than six months:\n\nProvided that a Chaplain, who has had Special Leave, must render six years' Active Service before he can again have such leave.\n\n652. For the first period of a Chaplain's Special Leave, he is entitled to the Leave Allowance admissible during ordinary Furlough. In subsequent periods he is entitled to no Leave Allowance.\n\n653. The Subsidiary Leave of a Chaplain and the beginning and ending of his Furlough and Special Leave are regulated by the Rules in Chapter XIII.\n\n654. A Chaplain on Subsidiary Leave is entitled to the same Allowances as during the Leave to which it is Subsidiary.\n\n655. A Chaplain may draw Allowances as if he were on Privilege Leave for any part of his Subsidiary Leave preparatory to retiring from the Service or going on Furlough or Special Leave, for which if he were not retiring from the Service or going on furlough or on Special Leave, Privilege Leave would be admissible to him.\n\n656. Privilege Leave may be granted as follows:\u2014\n\n(i) After five months' uninterrupted duty,\u2014for not more than one month.\n\n(ii) After ten months' uninterrupted duty,\u2014for not more than two months.\n\n(iii) After fifteen months' uninterrupted duty,\u2014for not more than three months.\n\nNote.\u2014[Time spent by a Chaplain in Kashmir under Foreign Department Order No. 84, dated 13th March, 1863, counts as time spent on duty, except for the purposes of this Article.]\n\n657. In applying for Privilege Leave, a Chaplain must record a declaration that he has no intention of retiring or of taking Furlough Special Leave, Subsidiary Leave, or Leave on Medical Certificate for three months after his return to duty. Though not absolutely debarred by this declaration from applying to retire or to take such leave within three months, he should, if he does so, explain his change of mind.\n\n658. A Chaplain may not take Privilege Leave in instalments.\n\n659. A Chaplain on Privilege Leave is entitled to the same pay and house-rent as if he were on duty.\n\n660. Benefices in the United Kingdom.\u2014The orders in the following Resolution by the Secretary of State for India in Council, dated 11th December, 1888, regarding the acceptance by Chaplains of Benefices in the United Kingdom, should be strictly adhered to:\u2014\n\nA Chaplain accepting a Benefice in the United Kingdom must forthwith report his having done so to the Government under which he is serving, if he is in India, or to the Secretary of State if he is out of India on Furlough; and on the expiry of any leave which may (whether before or after such acceptance) have been granted to him, his Indian appointment will be deemed vacant. If he desires to retain his Indian appointment he must, before the expiry of his leave, resign the Benefice, having first obtained the consent of the Secretary of State and of the Bishop of the Diocese in which the Benefice is situated to his doing so.\n\nNo extension of leave will under any circumstances be granted to a Chaplain on furlough who has accepted a Benefice in the United Kingdom, unless he has resigned the same before the expiry of such furlough with the consent before mentioned.\u2014(Secretary of State's Despatch, No. 132 Public (Ecclesiastical), dated 27th December, 1888.)\n\n661. Pensions.\u2014Chaplains are entitled to pension according to the following scale:\u2014\n\n| Chaplains appointed before 25th June, 1891. | Chaplains appointed after 17th March, 1892. |\n|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| Per annum.                                | Per annum.                                  |\n| After 17 years' residence and 20 years' service ... \u00a3365 | After 20 years' residence and 23 years' service ... \u00a3365 |\n\nRetiring Pension.\n\nThe same as Chaplains appointed before 25th June, 1891\nGratuity and Pension on Medical Certificate.\n\n| Per annum | Gratuity. | Gratuity. |\n|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| \u00a3 s. d.   | \u00a3 s. d.   | \u00a3 s. d.   |\n| Under seven years' residence ... | 63 17 6 | Over three years' residence, for each completed year ... | 80 0 0 |\n| Seven years and over | 127 15 0 | Seven years and over, the same as Chaplains appointed before 25th June, 1891. | |\n| Ten ... | 173 7 6 | Per annum. | |\n| Fifteen ... | 292 0 0 | Ten years and over | 127 15 0 |\n|           |           | Thirteen ... | 173 7 6 |\n|           |           | Eighteen ... | 292 0 0 |\n\nNotes.\u2014(a) Gratuities are subject to a maximum of \u00a3800 and a minimum of \u00a3200.\n\n(b) The Invalid pensions of \u00a363 17s. 6d., \u00a3127 15s., and \u00a3173 7s. 6d. a year, are admissible only after a trial of a temperate climate and upon a certificate from the Medical Board attached to the Office of the Secretary of State for India that the officer is permanently unfit to serve in India.

If a Cooper\u2019s Hill Engineer is, after completing his three years\u2019 residence at College, required to go through a course of practical engineering in England under a Civil or Mechanical Engineer, his service, unless another date should be specified in his letter of appointment, will reckon from the commencement of the practical course, or from such later date as will be consistent with the regulation that he may count as service towards pension the time spent on such practical course to the extent of one year only.\n\n693. The service of a Cooper\u2019s Hill Engineer, whose case is not provided for in Articles 691 or 692, and who does not land in India by the 1st December, and that of any other Civil Engineer appointed by the Secretary of State, counts from the date on which he landed in India.\n\n694.

Except in the case of Officers appointed from the years 1883 to 1885, both inclusive, whose service will reckon from date of appointment, i.e., date of passing out of College, provided they arrive in India by the vessel in which they were ordered to embark or within two months of the date on which such vessel was advertised to sail, or other approximate date named in their letter of appointment; otherwise from date of arrival in India.\n695. The service of an Officer appointed in India begins ordinarily from the date on which he takes charge of the office to which he is first appointed (see Article 64 in Part II.).\n\n697. The leave of the Officers described in Article 690, if they were appointed to their offices by the Secretary of State or with his particular sanction, is governed by the regulations in Part III. for European services. The leave of certain Officers otherwise appointed, whose names are included in Appendix No. 3, is also governed by the European Service Leave Rules. The leave of all other Officers is regulated by the Indian Service Leave Rules.\n\n**Provident Fund.**\n\n**Character of Fund.**\n\n698. A Provident Fund, on the following basis, is sanctioned for the following Officers of the Public Works and Telegraph Departments:\n\n(a) Civil Engineers on the effective list of the Public Works Department.\n\n(b) Civil Engineers transferred to the Accounts Branch, or Superior Railway Revenue Establishments, or to Foreign Service under Part VII.\n\n(c) All Civil Members of the Superior Accounts Establishment who are not Civil Engineers.\n\n(d) All Superior Civil Officers of the Indian Telegraph Department.\n\n(e) All Civil Officers of the Superior Revenue Establishments of State Railways who are pensionable.\n\n(f) Civil Under-Secretaries and Assistant Secretaries in the Public Works Branch of the Secretariat of the Government of India or a Local Government or Administration.\n\n699. In the case of Officers who were in the Public Works or Telegraph Departments before the constitution of the Fund, the deposits are voluntary, and may be discontinued and renewed at the option of the contributor. But Officers who joined the departments after the constitution of the Fund must contribute to it. Apprentices may contribute to the Fund, but are not compelled to do so.\n\nNote.\u2014[The Fund was constituted as a compulsory Fund for \u2018Civil Engineers,\u2019 and Civil Members of the Superior Account Establishment, who are not Civil Engineers who entered the Department on and after 4th February, 1885, and was extended to \u2018Telegraph Officers,\u2019 with effect from 13th October, 1886.

The sum which will accumulate under Articles 699 and 700 to the credit of an Officer will be his absolute property, to be handed over to him, or to his heirs, unconditionally, on his leaving the service, or in the event of his death, as the case may be.\n\n702. The administration of the Fund rests with the Government of India in the Public Works Department.\n\n**Pension Rules.**\n\n703. The rules in this section apply to all Officers of the classes described in Article 690 as \u2018appointed in England,\u2019 and also to those Engineers \u2018appointed in India,\u2019 who have been specially admitted to the benefits of this section, on account of previous European training; the names of Officers so admitted are given in Appendix No. 13.\n\nNote.\u2014[The death, resignation, removal or retirement of any of these Officers should be promptly reported by the Government Department or head of office, under whom he is serving, directly to the Government of India in the Finance Department.]\n\n704. The pensionary claims of \u2018Indian College Engineers,\u2019 and of \u2018other Civil Engineers\u2019 (whether of purely Asiatic descent or not) \u2018appointed in India,\u2019 whose names are not included in Appendix No. 13, and of Telegraph Officers not included under Clauses (d) and (e) of Article 690, are governed by the ordinary rules prescribed for Officers in \u2018superior\u2019 service in Part IV. But in the case of Officers of this class who may rise to the rank of Superintending Engineer, or in the Telegraph Department, of Superintendent 1st grade, or in the Indo-European Telegraph Department, of Director, the Government of India will be prepared to consider favourably their admission to the pension rules, including those contained in Article 714, applicable to the Officers specified in Article 703, subject to any general restriction that may be prescribed as to the amount of pension payable to public servants who are Natives of India.\n\n1. The concessions made under this Article will not, in any case, include permission to count as qualifying service rendered under the age of twenty.\n\n705. The Government of India may, on special grounds, recommend for sanction of the Secretary of State the grant of an invalid pension, on the scale referred to in Article 713 (a), to an Officer belonging to the classes referred to as \u2018appointed in India,\u2019 in Article 690, provided that he be not of purely Asiatic descent.\n\n706. Unless there is something repugnant in the subject or context, the rules of Part IV. apply to Officers defined in Article 703, but they are modified in the points noted in the following Articles.\n\n707. Service under age.\u2014The rule which excludes service under the age of twenty years does not apply to the officers defined in Article 703. \u2018Indian College Engineers\u2019 are also exempted from this disability.\n\n708. Period added on account of previous experience.\u2014The Government of India may, in special cases, add a period, not exceeding three years, to the service of any Civil Engineer appointed to the Public Works Department before the 1st November, 1873, with initial rank higher than that of a 1st grade Assistant Engineer.\n\n709. The Civil Engineers whose names are included in lists (a) and (b) of Appendix No. 14, who were appointed to the Department as Assistant Engineers, 1st grade, are, subject to the proviso in Article 710, allowed, on account\nof previous experience, to add to their pensionable service a period not exceeding three years, provided such previous experience was not acquired before the age of twenty-five.\n\n1. The service of an officer who receives any benefit from this concession cannot commence from a date anterior to that on which he attained the age of twenty-five.\n\n710. The concessions referred to in Articles 708 and 709 will not, however, be granted to any Officer taken over, directly or indirectly, from one of the Guaranteed Railway Companies who received a bonus on leaving the service of the Company.\n\n711. Periods of Leave and Suspension.\u2014(a) An Officer belonging to any of the classes defined in Article 703 counts leave with allowances out of India as service as follows:\n\nIf the service of the Officer is not less than period not exceeding\n\n| Years | Scale of Pension | Maximum limit of Pension |\n|-------|-----------------|-------------------------|\n| 20    | 20 sixtieths of Average Emoluments | 1,000 83\u00bd |\n| 25    | 25 & above | 4,000 333\u00bd |\n|       |                | 5,000 416\u00bd |\n\n(b) Otherwise time passed on leave, other than Privilege or Subsidiary Leave, does not count.\n\n(c) The service referred to in this Article includes any period that may be added under Article 708 or 709.\n\nNote.\u2014[The addition of the words \"out of India\" in the second line of this Article has effect from the 16th October, 1894, and leave taken in India after that date, or in the case of officers admitted after that date, to the benefit of this Article at any time, does not count.]\n\n712.

Sanction to Transfer.\u2014An Officer may not be transferred to Foreign service of the first kind unless the following conditions are complied with:\n\n(i) The service required of the Officer transferred is one which it is advantageous for public reasons (and not merely in the interest of the Officer concerned) should be provided for by a servant of the British Indian Government.\n\n(ii) The transfer is made by, or with the consent of, the Local Government under which the Officer is serving, and also if he is transferred for service under a Native State and the pay offered exceeds Rs. 250 a month, with the consent of the Government of India in the Foreign Department.\n\nThe consent of the Government of India is not required in the case of an Officer appointed to officiate during the absence of the permanent incumbent of a sanctioned appointment in a Native State, provided that the officiating allowance is regulated in accordance with Part II.\n\nThe sanction of the Government of India is also required to the transfer of any Officer to the service of Her Majesty's Government in England or of any Colonial or Foreign Government.\n\n(iii) The Officer transferred has either ten years' qualifying service (for pension) under Government or belongs to one of the following services:\u2014The Indian Civil Service; the Army; the 'Commission' of any Non-Regulation Province; the graded Political Departments; the Superior Service of the Public Works (including Railway Revenue and Account Branches), Telegraph, Survey, or Forest Department; the graded Educational Service; the Indian Marine.\n\n(iv) The Officer transferred shall receive only the remuneration agreed upon or sanctioned by the Local Government or the Government of India, as the case may be, in his behalf.\n\n(v) The Officer transferred shall remain, while on Foreign Service, subject to the general and disciplinary rules which apply to Officers on active Government service.\n\nNote.\u2014[Service under a landholder who retains the management of his own estate is not 'Foreign Service' for the purposes of these regulations, unless, in an altogether exceptional case, the importance of the estate or its owner is such as to justify the transfer of the services of a Government Officer to occupy an important position, such as manager, &c.]\n\n807. Salary from Foreign Employer.\u2014The consent of the Government of India in the Foreign Department is required to any increase to the salary of an Officer already transferred to the service of a Native State, which has the effect of raising the Officer's net salary above Rs. 250 a month. And also to any increase to a net salary which, before the increase, exceeds Rs. 250 a month.\n\n808. Contribution required.\u2014Whatever may be the actual pay and allowance drawn by an Officer in Foreign Service from his employers, his salary, for the purpose of calculating his leave allowances and pension, and of requiring a contribution towards the cost of such leave allowances and pension, shall be assumed to be as follows:\n\n(a) If he is a member of any of the special services mentioned in Article 806 (iii)\u2014\n(i) During the first two years of his service reckoning from the first day of April next following his arrival in India or date of appointment if he was appointed in India Rs. Rs.\n(ii) For each subsequent year of service Rs. Rs.\nUp to a maximum of Twice the maximum Furlough allowance admissible to the officer concerned.*\n\n* Example.\u2014If an Officer's furlough allowance is subject to a maximum of \u00a3250 per quarter, and the official rate of exchange for the year is 1 shilling 4 pence per rupee, the maximum on which a contribution is required would be Rs. 2,500 per mensem. If the furlough allowance is subject to a maximum of \u00a3120 per quarter, the maximum on which a contribution is required would be Rs. 1,200 per mensem.\n\nNote.\u2014[Percentage deductions (e.g., for Civil Fund in the case of a Member of the Indian Civil Service) will be calculated upon the 'assumed salary.']\n\n(b) If the Officer is not a member of any of the above services, then\u2014\n\n(i) If he belongs to a graded service, his name will be retained on it (as seconded), promotion from grade to grade being given to him in due course, and his assumed pay will be that of the grade in which from time to time he is.\n\nNote.\u2014[If the officer belongs to a graded service in which the pay of appointments is progressive, his assumed pay will be the pay he last drew in Government employ. If he is promoted to a higher grade while in foreign service, his assumed pay will be the minimum pay of the grade to which he is promoted.]\n\n(ii) If he does not belong to a graded service, the assumed pay will be, and will remain, that which he last drew when in Government employ.\n\n809. (a) From every Officer transferred in the manner specified in Article 806, who does not wholly resign the service of the British Government, or who is not, for recorded special and public reasons, exempted from the operation of the rules in this chapter, a contribution is levied as follows:\u2014\n(i) In the case of Officers of the special services mentioned in Rule 806 (iii), on account of leave allowances (excepting privilege leave) and pension\u2014one-fourth of the assumed-pay: Provided that in the case of an Officer whose pension is subject to the maximum of Rs. 5,000 a year the contribution shall not be calculated on a higher salary than (a) of Rs. 1,250 a month in the case of Officers subject to European Service leave rules, and (b) of Rs. 1,000 a month in the case of Officers subject to Indian Service leave rules.\n\nNote 1.\u2014[In the case of Officers subject to European Service leave rules a higher limit has been fixed because of the higher maximum furlough allowance drawn by them.]\n\nNote 2.\u2014[The pensions of officers, who, though not yet eligible, may in the future become eligible for the special additional pensions admissible under Article 714, are not considered to be subject to the maximum of Rs. 5,000 a year.]\n\n(ii) In the case of others, on account of pension only\u2014one-eighth of the assumed pay: Provided that, in the case of an Officer whose pension is subject to the maximum of Rs. 5,000 a year the contribution will not be calculated on a higher salary than Rs. 833\u00bd a month.\n\n(b) An Officer is not permitted to withhold the contribution upon condition that the time of his Foreign service shall not count for pension or leave: he must either wholly resign the British service or, unless he is specially exempted, make the contribution required by this Article 810. (a) The rates of Contribution prescribed in the preceding Article apply to all Officers transferred to Foreign service after 7th January, 1889, the date of Finance Department Resolution No. 109. The rates which were previously in force will continue to operate, in the case of all officers transferred to Foreign Service before that date, subject to the following conditions:\n\n(1) That in cases of officers of the Public Works Department transferred to the service of a Railway Company upon terms agreed upon between Government and the Company, their appointments under the Company remain unchanged. If their appointments under the Company are changed, or if they enter on fresh engagements even without returning to the service of the Government, they become subject to the new rates of contribution. It will rest with the Government of India in the Public Works Department to decide whether the appointments have been changed or not;\n\n(2) That in the case of all officers transferred to Foreign Service, the former rates of contribution will operate only until the new rates are applied, in each case, under the orders of the Local Government by whom the officer was transferred. In all cases in which the new rates have not been so applied, and in which the officer\u2019s salary may not under existing rules be increased without the sanction of the British Government, such sanction will, in future, be subject to the condition that the increase shall not be liable to contribution and shall not be reckoned for any purpose of leave allowance or pension.\n\n(b) Previous to the issue of the Resolution of 7th January, 1889, above referred to, the rates of contribution were determined by the following Rules:\n\nFrom every Officer transferred to Foreign service who does not wholly resign the service of the British Government, or who is not, for recorded special and public reasons, exempted from the operation of this rule, a contribution is levied as follows:\n\n(A) In the case of a Member of the Indian Civil Service:\u2014at the rate of 16\u00bd per cent. (one-sixth) on the gross salary which he receives from his Foreign employers.\n\n(B) In the case of any other Officer:\u2014at the rate of 14\u00bd per cent. (one-seventh) on the gross salary which he receives from his Foreign employers; provided always that the contribution from a Civil Officer, other than a Member of the Indian Civil Service, or a Civil Engineer, shall in no case exceed Rs. 166\u00bd a month, and from a Civil Engineer, Rs. 233\u00bd a month.\n\nThat is to say, the Officer receives from his foreign employers salary fixed in accordance with the rules of the public service for the appointment which he holds or in which he officiates, and retaining five-sixths or six-sevenths accordingly as he is an Officer of Class (A) or (B), pays one-sixth or one-seventh, as the case may be, to the Government of India.\n\nIn return for this contribution, the Government accepts the charge for the officer\u2019s pension, and also that for his absentee allowances (except on privilege leave, when the Government will pay only its share according to the rule of proportions, and during which the contribution must be paid in the same manner as if the officer were on duty) in the same manner and to the same extent as if he were in the regular service of the British Government, saving only that the calculation of pension or absentee allowance is based upon the five-sixths or six-sevenths (as the case may be) pay which he retains, and not upon the full amount which he receives.\n\n811. Service in Egypt.\u2014Officers transferred for service under the Egyptian Government shall contribute for pension only. Such contributions shall, in the case of all officers transferred on or after the 1st of April, 1890, be regulated by the provisions of Articles 808 and 809. The rate leviable in the case of officers of the special services mentioned in rule 806 (iii) will be one-sixth of their assumed pay, which represents the proportionate share on account of pension only, of the one-fourth prescribed in Article 809 (a) (i) on account of both leave and pension. Service in Egypt will in no case count as service towards Indian furlough. To officers transferred before 1st April, 1890, Article 811 as published in the first edition of the Civil Service Regulations will continue to apply.\n\nNote 1.\u2014[In the case of a Military Officer, the contribution prescribed covers the liability of Indian revenues for temporary half-pay, or half-pay pension in any case of an Officer losing his health during Egyptian service before becoming entitled to ordinary so-called full-pay pension.]\n\nNote 2.\u2014[See note under Article 828 (c).]\n812. Foreign Service during Leave.\u2014(a) When an Officer's services are lent for other than Imperial purposes, either to Her Majesty's Government in England, or to a British Colony, or to a foreign State or Municipality, the Officer shall make a contribution to the Indian Exchequer in accordance with the rules in this chapter.\n\nNote.\u2014[An Officer holding any appointment out of India, Civil or Military, under Her Majesty's Government, and paid from the Imperial, that is, the Home Revenues, as distinguished from local, municipal or Colonial funds, is to be considered as having been lent for Imperial purposes, and is therefore exempt from payment of contribution under this Chapter.]\n\n(b) But if an Officer while absent on furlough is permitted to take employment of the above kind, or if an officer is allowed to take furlough for the purpose of taking such employment, he may draw his furlough allowance from Indian revenues in addition to any allowance which may be assigned to him for the employment; in this case the contribution is not required for the period of the officer's employment as above, but will be payable from the date of the expiry of the furlough should the Officer continue in it. Service under Her Majesty's Government in England, or under any Colonial or Foreign Government outside of India, will, in this case, be held to begin from the date of the expiry of the furlough.\n\nNote.\u2014[The sanction of the Government of India is required to the transfer of an Officer to any service of the description mentioned in this Article.]\n\n813. No Officer employed as above on any duty unconnected with India shall, except as provided in Articles 812 and 814, receive any allowances from Indian revenues while so employed.\n\n814. If an Officer is, at the time of his transfer, entitled to Privilege Leave, and obtains it with the avowed intention of taking employment under the Egyptian Government, he may draw his Privilege Leave Allowances from Indian revenues, in addition to any allowances which may be assigned to him by the Egyptian Government without being required during the period of leave to make the contribution for pension in respect of employment in Egypt. The right to receive Privilege Leave Allowance is, however, contingent on his return to duty under the Indian Government on the expiry of the leave; if, therefore, an Officer continues in the service of the Egyptian Government after the end of seven days from the date of the expiry of his Privilege Leave, the leave will be considered as cancelled, and the Officer's foreign service will be held to have begun on the date from which he availed himself of his Privilege Leave.\n\nTemporary Transfers.\n\n815. (a) No contribution is levied from an Officer who is transferred to foreign service for a special temporary duty not lasting more than six months: Provided that exemption can only be claimed under this Article if it is specially provided for from the beginning as part of the terms of the arrangement under which the Officer's services are transferred.\n\n(b) In determining whether contributions are payable or not, the point to be considered is the duration of the appointment or duty to which the Officer is transferred and not the duration of the particular Officer's employment in the appointment or on the special duty.\n\n816. The Local Government may remit the contribution for any period during which an Officer on foreign service is temporarily employed under the British Government on duties additional to, or distinct from, his duties on foreign service.\n\nRules for Payment of Contribution.\n\n826. If the salary of an Officer is paid under the orders of the Accountant-General at a British Government Treasury, the required contribution is deducted at time of payment. In all other cases the Officer himself must pay the amount directly to the British Government in the manner prescribed in the following rules*; the Government will not ordinarily enter into any direct arrangements with the foreign employers of its Officers or make any direct demands upon them.\n\nGeneral Conditions of Service.\n\n835. (a) In return for the contributions prescribed in Article 809 (a) (i) (Foreign Service of the first kind), the Government accepts the charge for the Officer's pension, and also that for his absentee allowances (except on Privilege Leave, when the Government will pay only its share, according to the Rule of Proportions calculated on the assumed pay referred to in Article 808 (a), and during which contribution calculated on the share of the leave allowances payable by the foreign body, must be paid in the same manner as if the Officer were on duty), in the same manner and to the same extent as if he were in the regular service of the British Government, saving only that the calculation of pension or absentee allowance is based upon the pay upon which he contributes (see Article 808) and not upon the amount which he receives from his foreign employer.\n\nNote.\u2014[In calculating the leave allowances of a Member of the Indian Civil Service one twenty-fourth must be added to the assumed or actual salary, in order to provide for the four per cent. annuity deduction. For example: if the average salary is Rs. 960 (net) the half average fixed for Leave Allowance will be Rs. 500, and not Rs. 480; because the Leave Allowance of Rs. 500, being subject to four per cent. deduction, the net amount payable will be only Rs. 480.]\n\n(b) In return for the contribution prescribed in Article 809 (a) (ii), the Government accepts the charge for the Officer's pension only, but not for his Absentee Allowances, of which the British Government will thenceforth only pay its share according to the Rule of Proportions, calculated on the assumed pay referred to in Article 808 (b).\n\n836. In return for the contribution prescribed in Clauses (a) and (b) of Article 823 (Foreign Service of the second kind), the Government accepts the charge for the Officer's pension and absentee allowances (except during privilege leave when the Government will pay only its share according to the Rule of Proportions, and during which the contribution must be paid in\n\n* Omitted from this Abstract.\nthe same manner as if the officer were on duty), in the same way as if he were in its own service.\n\n837. An Officer who contributes for pension only must, during Privilege Leave, pay his contribution in the same manner as if he were on duty, and if, after return to his British appointment, he takes Privilege Leave, a portion of which is earned by foreign service, he will receive from the General Revenues the Government share of his Leave Allowance, according to the Rule of Proportions, and must pay to the General Revenues the contribution required by Article 809 (a) (ii) for that portion of his Privilege Leave which was earned by his foreign service.\n\n838. The pension and leave of an Officer on foreign service, whether acting or permanent, are regulated by the rules which apply to Officers of the Government of India. And an Officer may not get leave, unless he actually quits duty and proceeds on leave.\n\n839. Subject to the regular rules any saving arising from the absence of a permanent Officer accrues to his employer, except when an Officer is exempted from the payment of the contribution prescribed in Article 809 [see Article 817, Exception (f)], when the saving should be paid to the British Government.\n\nPensions from Native States.\n\n840. Except with the sanction of the Government of India, no Officer belonging to the service of, or in receipt of a pension from, the British Government, who is employed under a Native State, may accept a pension or gratuity from such State.\n\nLien on Government Appointment.\n\n843. An Officer so transferred (i.e., transferred, under the rules in this chapter, from qualifying service to foreign service), when he returns to British service is entitled to resume the same position as that in which he left it; if he holds a progressive appointment his foreign service does not count towards increments; and he cannot return to acting service under the British Government without reverting also to his substantive British office, the locum tenens of this office thereupon falling back upon acting allowances. (See also Rule 1 under Article 79.)\n\nNote.\u2014[The object of this Article is to secure to an Officer the right to resume, on his return to British Service, the position he held when he left it. A Local Government is not debarred from giving an Officer any promotion to which his standing in the British Service would have entitled him had he not been transferred to foreign service, but the Officer has no claim to such promotion.]\n\nChapter XXXVII. deals with Foreign Service of the third kind: the general rule in the case of such service being that the relations between Government and the Officers employed in respect of their pensions and leave allowances are the same as if they were in ordinary Government service.\n\nChapter XXXVIII.\u2014Service under Local Funds.\n\n857. Apart from any special provisions, service paid for from a Local Fund does not qualify for pension.\n\nPART VIII. (Chapter XXXIX.) is concerned with Record of Service.\n\nPART IX.\u2014PROCEDURE RELATING TO LEAVE.\n\nChapter XL.\u2014Applications for and Grant of Leave.\n\n889. Except as provided in Articles 910 to 916A and 920 of this chapter, every application for leave should be submitted to the Local Government, or other authority whose duty it would be to fill up the appointment of the applicant if it was vacant.\n\n1. When a gazetted Officer applies for leave, he should quote the article or section of these Regulations under which he considers himself entitled to the leave.\n\n891. An Officer applying for Privilege Leave must record a declaration that he has no intention of retiring or of taking Furlough, Special Leave, Subsidiary Leave, Leave on Private Affairs, or Leave on Medical Certificate, for three months after his return to duty. Though not absolutely debarred by this declaration from applying for permission to retire or to take such leave within the three months, he should, if he does so, explain his change of mind.\n\nMedical Certificate.\n\n900. If the Officer is going on leave out of India, he should take with him one copy of the medical report upon his case.\n901. A duplicate of the medical report upon the case of an Officer going to Europe on leave on medical certificate should be forwarded direct to the India Office, addressed to the Under-Secretary of State for India, by the Local Government under which the Officer is employed, for the information of the Medical Board attached to the India Office, so as to arrive as soon as the Officer reaches England. No delay should be allowed to occur in the transmission of the duplicate report to the India Office.\n\n902. If an applicant for an extension or commutation of leave on medical certificate be residing out of India, and within sixty miles from London, he must produce a certificate from the Medical Board attached to the India Office, showing the necessity for the extension or commutation. If he be residing more than sixty miles from London, certificates must be produced from two medical practitioners; and he may be called upon to produce other evidence.\n\nGRANT OF LEAVE.\n\n908. Leave may be granted with retrospective effect from the date on which it is admissible.\n\n909. Unless specially otherwise ordered, leave must begin within thirty-one days of the date on which it is granted.\n\nRULES REGARDING CHAPLAINS.\n\n917. Applications for leave from Chaplains on the Bengal Ecclesiastical Establishment, and from Chaplains on other establishments serving in the Bengal Presidency, are dealt with under the Rules in this section, the priority of claim being determined in accordance with Chapter XIII., Article 342.\n\n918. Subject to the exigencies of the Public Service, Local Governments in the Bengal Presidency are empowered, with the concurrence of the Bishop of the Diocese, to grant any Furlough or Special Leave authorised by these Regulations to Chaplains serving within their respective jurisdictions.\n\n919. If a Chaplain applying for Furlough or Special Leave belong to the Madras or Bombay Ecclesiastical Establishment, the Local Government under which he is serving will, if the Furlough or leave be granted, inform the Government of Madras or Bombay, as the case may be.\n\n920. The Bishop of the Diocese is empowered to grant Privilege Leave to Chaplains under Article 656, subject to the public exigencies, of which the Bishop shall be judge. But the grant, cancelment, or extension of such leave should be reported to the Local Government concerned.\n\n922. Except under orders of the Secretary of State, the term of Furlough or Special Leave cannot be altered, without the permission of the Government by which it may have been granted.\n\n923. Every Chaplain who obtains leave shall supply himself with a last-pay certificate, and with a statement showing the allowances which he is entitled to draw while absent. It shall be the duty of the Accountant-General to furnish these documents (see Chapter XLII.), and no Leave Allowances will be payable without their production.\n\nNote.\u2014[If a Chaplain's term of twenty-five years' service expires (see Article 664) during his Leave, or during the period to which it is stated that it may be extended, the fact should be noted on the last-pay certificate.]\n\n924. A Chaplain shall report his return to duty to the Bishop, and to the Local Government by which his Leave or Furlough may have been granted.\n\n925. If any Local Government shall see fit to refuse a Furlough to any Chaplain on the ground of the exigencies of the Public Service, it shall report such refusal for the confirmation of the Government of India.\n\n926. Applications for Leave from Chaplains on the Madras and Bombay Establishments are made in accordance with the foregoing Rules, but Article 925 applies only to Chaplains on the Bengal Establishment.\n\nCHAPTER XLI.\u2014PAYMENT OF LEAVE ALLOWANCES.\n\n936. Place of Payment.\u2014Leave allowances are payable in India after the end of each calendar month; but an Officer on Furlough or Special Leave out of India may, at his option, take payment at the Home Treasury of the Government of India, and if he proceeds to any Colony named in the list in Appendix No. 17, in such Colony.\n\nAn Officer having selected the country in which he desires to draw his leave allowances is permitted to change only once during any one period of leave.\n\n942. Payment out of India.\u2014An Officer proceeding on Furlough or Special Leave out of India cannot draw his leave allowances at the Home or any Colonial Treasury unless he is provided with a Last-pay Certificate or Warrant in accordance with the Rules laid down in Chapter XLII.\n\n943. (a) Privilege Leave Allowances are not payable out of India, but in case an Officer leaving India should afterwards want his Leave to be commuted, he should take with him a Privilege Leave Certificate.\n\n945.\u2014Except as provided in Articles 946 and 947, when payment is made at the Home Treasury of the Government of India, or in a Colony where the standard of currency is gold, rupees are converted into sterling at the rate of exchange fixed, for the time being, for the adjustment of financial transactions between the Imperial and the Indian treasuries, subject to the condition that, with effect from the 1st April, 1892, 1s. 6d. to the rupee is fixed as the minimum rate at which the conversion into sterling shall be effected. If any payments are made at a different rate, or otherwise erroneously, they should be adjusted in subsequent payments.\n\nException.\u2014The Officers whose names are mentioned in Appendix No. 30 of the C.S. Regulations have been specially authorised by\nthe Secretary of State to receive leave allowances, while on leave out of India, at the rate of exchange of 2 shillings to the rupee.\n\n946. If, in any covenant or contract, dated before the 23rd day of November, 1871, with any Officer for service in India, it is provided that, in payments to be made under, or in pursuance of, the contract, a pound sterling shall be considered an equivalent or equal to, and calculated after the rate of, ten rupees, any leave allowance which the Officer is, under his covenant or contract, entitled to receive in England, shall be converted into sterling at that rate. But if, in such contract, no provision is made for the payment of any allowances during leave, the aforesaid rate of exchange will not apply to any leave allowances.\n\n947. The absentee allowance of a Military Officer on Furlough out of India and drawn in England, who elected the Military Furlough Rules of 1868 before the 1st July, 1871, is paid at the rate of two shillings the Government rupee, but this exception does not apply to a Military Officer in Civil employ subject to the Military Furlough Regulations of 1868 on Special Leave under Article 348. The absentee allowance of such an Officer, if drawn in England, is paid at the rate of exchange laid down in Article 945.\n\n948. Method of Payment in England.\u2014The Furlough allowances of all officers are issued at the Home Treasury monthly in arrear.\n\n\"The quarterly dates to which the allowances of Military (including Military Officers in Civil employ), Medical, Ecclesiastical, and Marine Officers are made up, are 15th February, 15th May, 15th August, and 15th November; whilst the quarterly dates to which the allowances of other officers are made up are 15th January, 15th April, 15th July, and 15th October, respectively. Payment in each case is made on or after the day following.\"\n\nAdvances (omitting shillings and pence) of one third, approximately, of the net quarterly amount are payable on the 16th of the first and second month of each quarter, and the balance of the three months, less Income Tax, and other deductions (if any) on the quarterly dates on which the allowances are payable as specified above.\n\nPayment is made\u2014\n\n(i) To the Officer on his personal application;\nor\n(ii) To his banker or other agent, duly authorised under power-of-attorney, on production of a life certificate filled up and executed in the manner directed thereon, except in cases where proof of existence is not required owing to the banker having guaranteed the Secretary of State against loss consequent on his dispensing with the production of such proof; or\n(iii) On presentation of a draft, duly filled up and signed by the Officer, in a form which, with the requisite form of life certificate attached, may be obtained from the India Office, London, on the Officer's written application.\n\n949. If not drawn in England.\u2014(a) If an Officer proceeding on Long Leave to Europe does not intend to draw allowances from the Home Treasury during his absence, he must nevertheless take with him a Certificate of Leave in the following form, from the Audit Officer in whose circle of audit his appointment is held. If the Officer visits England, this certificate is to be presented at the India Office:\n\nCertificate of Leave Granted to (name of, and designation of office held by, the Officer) Proceeding out of India.\n\nNote.\u2014[The allowances admissible to the Officer during leave will be paid in India.]\n\n1.\u2014Government under which employed.\n2.\u2014Date of beginning and ending of any leave already taken; the nature of such leave, and the rule under which it was taken.\n3.\u2014Article of the Civil Service Regulations under which the leave is granted.\n\nNote.\u2014[Distinguish Furlough granted on medical certificate from Furlough granted without medical certificate.]\n\n4.\u2014Period of leave.\n5.\u2014Date of commencement of leave.\n6.\u2014Monthly rate of absentee allowance.\n7.\u2014Source from which absentee allowance is payable.\n*8.\u2014Period for, and terms on, which leave may be extended or commuted otherwise than to Extraordinary Leave.\n\n(Place) (Signature)\nAudit Office.\n\n1. A Military Officer subject to the Military Leave Rules proceeding on Furlough cannot obtain the certificate in this Article until he submits to the Audit Officer a certificate in form No. 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, as the case may be\u2014\n\n(i) In the case of an Officer of the Bengal Army, by the Secretary to the Government of India in the Military Department; and\n\n(ii) In the case of an Officer of the Madras or Bombay Army, by the Adjutant-General of the Army to which he belongs.\n\n(b) If the Officer afterwards desire to draw his leave allowances at the Home Treasury of the Government of India or at some Colonial treasury, he must obtain a last-pay certificate from the Audit Officer in whose circle of audit he was employed when he proceeded on leave.\n\n*In filling up entry 8 the Audit Officer should always mention that no extension or commutation of the leave, otherwise than on medical certificate, will be allowed by the Secretary of State for India, unless the previous consent of the Local Government has been obtained. It should also be noted that an extension of leave on medical certificate is not granted by Her Majesty's Secretary of State for India, for a longer period than six months, subject to renewal, if necessary.\u2014(Despatches from Secretary of State, Nos. 25 and 212 (Financial), dated, respectively, 29th January, 1891, and 15th November, 1894.)\n950. An Officer proceeding on Long Leave to a Colony in America or the West Indies must take with him a 'certificate of leave granted' in the form referred to in Article 949 (a). If the Officer visit England or has occasion to apply for an extension of leave, the certificate should be presented at the India Office. If not previously presented, it must be forwarded to the India Office when permission to return to duty is applied for.\n\nCHAPTER XLII.\u2014LAST-PAY CERTIFICATES.\n\n951. Except as provided in Article 956, no Officer can begin to draw his leave allowances at any treasury in India, or at the Home Treasury of the Government of India, without producing a Last-pay Certificate from the treasury where his pay or allowances were last disbursed, or from the Accountant-General within whose jurisdiction this treasury is.\n\n964. An Officer proceeding to Europe should present his Last-pay Certificate at the India Office in London. When he returns to India, he should obtain a Last-pay Certificate from the India Office.\n\nPART X.\u2014PROCEDURE RELATING TO PENSIONS.\n\nCHAPTER XLIII.\u2014APPLICATIONS FOR AND GRANTS OF PENSIONS.\n\n986. The Rules in this Chapter apply to all Officers applying for pension under these Regulations, except\u2014\n\n(a) Members of the Indian Civil Service\u2014vide Chapter XLV.\n\n(b) Chaplains\u2014vide Chapter XLVI.\n\n(c) Judges of the High Courts, for whom no special procedure is laid down.\n\n937. There is no limitation on the period after retirement within which an application for pension or gratuity must be submitted; but, apart from special orders, a pension applied for after the Officer has retired begins from the date of application. (See also Article 1013.) An Officer may be admitted to pension while absent on leave, whether in or out of India.\n\n992. If an Officer in superior service, whose age is less than sixty years, is required to retire under Article 503 (a), the Head of his Office must certify in the column for 'Any other remarks,' on the third page of the application for his pension, the cause of the applicant's inefficiency, and quote the order of the Local Government sanctioning the applicant's retirement as superannuated. If the Officer wishes to retire of his own accord under Article 508, the fact should be stated.\n\n995. (a) The Government of India is ordinarily unwilling to pass orders on questions affecting the pension of an Officer until he actually retires, because their premature discussion occupies valuable time almost always to no purpose and uselessly.\n\n998. Powers of Sanction.\u2014In a case falling clearly and strictly within the letter of the Regulations, the Local Government may grant the pension admissible; but the grant is subject to revision by the Government of India in the Finance Department.\n\n1003. Should the amount granted to an Officer be found to be in excess of that to which the Government of India in the Finance Department considers him entitled under the regulations, he will be called upon to refund such excess.\n\nCHAPTER XLIV.\u2014PAYMENTS.\n\nPlace of Payment.\n\n1015. When a pension is stated in rupees, it is payable at any treasury of the Government of India in India; or, at the pensioner's option, at the Home Treasury of the Government of India.\n\n1015A. All pensions granted in rupees, which are payable at the Home Treasury to residents in the United Kingdom, or which are payable to residents in any country other than India in which the standard of currency is gold, are paid, with effect from the 1st April, 1890, at the rate of exchange annually fixed for the adjustment of transactions between the British and Indian Governments, subject to the condition that the rate of 1s. 9d. the rupee is fixed as the minimum rate at which the conversion into sterling shall be effected.\n\nThis condition does not apply to pensioners residing in Asia who are permitted to draw their pensions in the United Kingdom through an agent. In their case pensions are paid at the official rate of exchange for the year.\n\nNote 1.\u2014[The same rate of exchange is adopted in issuing gratuities to persons residing in any country other than India in which gold is the standard of currency. But when the service of an officer to whom a gratuity is granted terminates in India, the gratuity should be paid in India.]\n\nNote 2.\u2014[A pensioner who has been resident in any country other than India in which the standard of currency is gold, ceases to be entitled to draw his pension at the minimum rate of 1s. 9d. the rupee after a continuous absence of six months. After such absence he shall be held to be no longer resident therein, unless\nhe shall adduce satisfactory evidence of continued residence to the Secretary of State. Failing such evidence all pension accruing after the first six months of absence will be converted at the rate of exchange annually fixed for transactions with the British Government.\n\n1016. Covenanted Rate of Exchange.\u2014The rule for the payment at the Home Treasury of a pension at the rate of exchange fixed yearly for the adjustment of financial transactions between the Imperial and Indian Governments applies to an Officer under covenant who is entitled by his covenant to pension; the covenanted rate of exchange for his pay and allowances does not, unless it is expressly so stated, apply to his pension.\n\n1017. Transfers between England and India.\u2014(a) Transfer of a pension from the Home Treasury to an Indian Treasury is permitted whenever desired.\n\n(b) Transfer of a pension from an Indian to the Home Treasury is permitted only once.\n\nProcedure in Paying.\n\n1021. A gratuity is paid in a single sum, and not by instalments.\n\n1025. A pension is payable in India monthly on and after the first day of the following month.\n\nPayment in England.\n\n1049. At the Home Treasury pensions are payable monthly in arrear. The quarterly dates to which Military (including those of Military Officers in Civil employ), Medical (including annuities), Ecclesiastical, and Marine annuities and pensions are made up, are 15th February, 15th May, 15th August, and 15th November; whilst the quarterly dates to which other annuities and pensions are made up are 15th January, 15th April, 15th July, and 15th October, respectively. Payment in each case is made on or after the day following.\n\nAdvances (omitting shillings and pence) of one-third, approximately, of the net quarterly amount are payable on the 16th of the first and second month of each quarter, and the balance of the three months, less Income Tax, and other deductions (if any) on the quarterly dates on which the annuity or pension is payable as specified above.\n\nPayment in a Colony.\n\n1051. The Rules in this Section apply to pensions granted under the Rules in any Chapter of these Regulations.\n\n1052. The pension of a pensioner residing in any Colony named in Appendix No. 17 may be paid there.\n\n1057. Pensions stated in Indian money shall, where the standard of currency of the Colony is gold, except when it is otherwise arranged, be paid in sterling money at the rate of exchange annually fixed for the adjustment of transactions between the British and Indian Governments, subject to the condition that the rate of 1s. gd. the rupee is fixed, with effect from the 1st of April, 1890, as the minimum rate at which the conversion into sterling shall be effected. If any payments are made at a different rate or otherwise erroneously, they should be adjusted in subsequent payments.\n\nNote.\u2014[See notes to Article 1015A above.]\n\n1058. Transfer of Payment.\u2014In case a Pensioner desires transfer of payment of his pension from one Colony to another, the Government of India will recognise the proceedings of the Colonial Authorities sanctioning such transfer, which should, however, be reported separately by the pensioner to the Government of India and to the Under-Secretary of State for India.\n\n1059. Upon his return to India, an Officer should deliver up his duplicate Warrant, which will serve the purpose of a last-pay certificate.\n\nApplications.\n\n1062. The rules in this Section apply to all members of the Indian Civil Service.\n\n1066. During leave to Europe.\u2014(a) A Member of the Indian Civil Service, who wishes to retire from the service while on leave in Europe, must submit his application to the Secretary of State.\n\n(b) When an Officer makes his application under this Article, whether after completing his full period of service, or after having been declared by the Medical Board to be unfit for further service in India, his resignation is accepted, subject to the adjustment of any demands that may be standing against him in India; and he is directed to apply to the Government of India, the Government of Madras, or the Government of Bombay, as the case may be, for the annuity or gratuity to which his length of service may entitle him.\n\nCommencement of Annuities.\n\n1068. The annuity of an Officer who leaves India by sea, when retiring from the service at the end of subsidiary leave, begins, and his subsidiary leave ends, on the day of the departure of the vessel in which he sails.\n\n1069. The annuity of a Member of Council who has not previously resigned his seat in Council, or whose successor has not entered upon his office, commences from the day following that on which the vessel in which he leaves India sails, or from the expiry of his five years' tenure of office, whichever date is earlier.\n\nManner of Payment.\n\n1071. Annuities are payable in arrear, monthly, and to date of decease.\n\n1072. (a) Payment of annuities and gratuities may be taken at the Home Treasury in sterling\nmoney, or in India in Government rupees, at the following rate:\n\n(i) If the annuitant was a member of the Indian Civil Service on the Bengal establishment\u201410 Government rupees for each pound sterling.\n\n(ii) If the annuitant was a member of the Indian Civil Service on the Madras or Bombay establishment\u201410.65 Government rupees for each pound sterling.\n\nNote.\u2014[The reasons for the difference in the rates of exchange are to be found in the history of the Annuity Funds. The rates of exchange differ considerably in the various Service Funds.]\n\n(b) Provided that any annuitant, who is a permanent resident in India, may, if he wishes to draw his annuity in that country, exercise the option of receiving it at the rate of exchange annually fixed for the adjustment of transactions between the British and Indian Exchequers.\n\nNote.\u2014[This rule applies to all Officers whose pensions are stated in sterling, and who, being resident in Asia, take payment in India.]\n\nTransfer of Payment.\n\n1073. Transfer from the Home Treasury to an Indian treasury, and vice versa, is permitted twice only.\n\nPayment in a Colony.\n\n1076. Payment of annuities may be made in any of the Colonies named in Appendix No. 17, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Chapter XLIV., Articles 1051 to 1061.\n\nChapter XLVI.\u2014Chaplains.\n\n1077. Applications may be made to, and pensions are granted either by the Government of India, the Government of Bombay, or the Government of Madras (as the case may be), or by the Secretary of State.\n\n1. At least six months before a Chaplain, whether of the Church of England or the Church of Scotland, completes his full period of service, a statement should be furnished by the Local Government concerned to the Government of India in the Home Department, for transmission to the Secretary of State, showing the date on which the Chaplain completes such service, whether he is in England or in India. It should also be stated whether he is on duty or on leave, and if the latter, for what period.\n\n1078. Applications in England.\u2014(a) A Chaplain proceeding to England on retirement without applying for pension to the Government of India, the Government of Bombay, or the Government of Madras (as the case may be), should procure a certificate:\n\n(i) If he is a Chaplain on the Bengal Establishment, or a Chaplain of the Church of Scotland serving in the Bengal Presidency\u2014from the Comptroller, Indian Treasuries;\n\n(ii) If he is a Chaplain on the Bombay or the Madras Establishment, or a Chaplain of the Church of Scotland serving in Madras or Bombay\u2014from the Accountant-General at Bombay or Madras (as the case may be);\n\nshowing his service, residence, the amount of pension to which he is entitled, and the date from which his pension may be paid.\n\n1079. Applications in India.\u2014A Chaplain belonging to the Bengal Ecclesiastical Establishment, who wishes to obtain pension from the authorities in India, must submit his application to the Government of India in the Home Department, through the Archdeacon or Bishop of his Diocese.\n\n1080. A Chaplain belonging to the Madras or Bombay Ecclesiastical Establishment must submit his application to the Government of Madras or the Government of Bombay, as the case may be, through the Archdeacon or the Bishop of his diocese.\n\n1081. A Chaplain of the Church of Scotland serving in the Bengal Presidency, who wishes to obtain pension from the authorities in India, must submit his application to the Government of India in the Home Department, if he is not Senior Chaplain, through the Senior Chaplain of the Church of Scotland.\n\n1082. A Chaplain of the Church of Scotland serving in Madras or Bombay, must submit his application to the Government of Madras or Bombay, as the case may be, if he is not Senior Chaplain, through the Senior Chaplain of his Presidency.\n\n1083. The Home Department, before accepting the resignation of a Chaplain on the Bengal Establishment, or a Chaplain of the Church of Scotland serving in the Bengal Presidency, should obtain a certificate from the Comptroller, Indian Treasuries, showing the Chaplain's service, residence, and the amount of pension to which he is entitled. The Government of Madras or Bombay, as the case may be, should obtain a like certificate from the Accountant-General of the Presidency concerned.\n\n1084. Grant of Pension in India.\u2014(a) In the case of the Bengal Presidency, if the Chaplain's resignation is accepted, the case should be forwarded to the Finance Department of the Government of India, in which department a resolution will be recorded granting the pension to which the Chaplain may be entitled.\n\n(b) In the case of the Madras or Bombay Presidency, the procedure is the same, but the resolution is issued by Madras or Bombay, as the case may be.\n\n1085. Last-pay Certificate.\u2014A Chaplain to whom pension has been granted in India, should be careful before proceeding to England to obtain the usual certificate of the last issue or pay or pension to him in India.\nPART XI.\u2014Chapters XLVII. to LIII. contain Regulations relating to Travelling Allowances.\n\nExtract from Chapter L.\n\n1195. The rules regarding\u2014\n(a) Passage to India, and outfit allowances (in case of appointment in Europe).\n(b) Return to Europe (on termination of appointment).\n\nof certain high officers, which have been framed by Her Majesty's Secretary of State for India, are given in Appendix 29.\n\n1196. Officers appointed in Europe to the Telegraph, Public Works, Forest, and Educational Departments, to the Geological Survey of India, and to the Bengal Pilot Service, are ordinarily allowed by the Secretary of State a free passage to India.\n\n1197. Chaplains also are ordinarily allowed a free passage to India, and in the contracts now entered into by them they engage to refund the cost of their passage to India, in the event of their resigning their appointments within three years after the date of their arrival in India on grounds other than ill-health, under a medical certificate.\n\n1197A. If the health of a Chaplain appointed on probation compels him to leave India during the probationary period, he must resign the service entirely, in which case he will not be entitled to anything beyond a free return passage to his country.\n\nA probationer removed from the service for misconduct of any kind, or who resigns his position for any cause other than certified ill-health, will not be entitled to a return passage to his country, and will be bound to refund the cost of his passage to India.\n\n1198. An Officer appointed to the Bengal Pilot Service is granted an Outfit Allowance of \u00a320.\n\n1200. An Officer, who is appointed by the Secretary of State, while resident in Europe, and who is not one of the High Officers mentioned in Article 1195, is entitled to Travelling Allowance at the rates laid down in Chapter XLVIII. from the capital town of the Presidency to which he is attached, to the first station to which he is posted.\n\n1201. (a) If such an Officer disembarks in India at any port other than the capital town of the Presidency to which he is attached, he is entitled to Travelling Allowance from such port to the first station to which he is posted, limited to the amount to which he would have been entitled under the preceding Article if he had disembarked at such capital town.\n\n(b) But if an Officer is directed by the Secretary of State to proceed to a particular port, he is entitled to Travelling Allowance from that port.\n\n1202. For the purposes of the preceding Articles, an Officer attached to any Province or Presidency, other than Bombay or Madras, is held to be attached to the Bengal Presidency.\n\nPART XII.\u2014APPENDICES.\n\nAPPENDIX No. 17.\n\nReferred to in Articles 936 and 1052.\n\nList of Colonial Treasurers, District Paymasters, and other Imperial Agents in the Colonies.\n\n| Station                          | Designation of Agent                                      |\n|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| Bahamas                         | The Registrar of Deeds, Nassau, Bahamas.                 |\n| Barbados (including British Guiana, Trinidad, &c.) | The District Paymaster, Barbados.                        |\n| Bermuda                         | The District Paymaster, Bermuda.                         |\n| British Columbia                | Included in the Dominion of Canada (see below).          |\n| British Honduras               | The Colonial Treasurer, Belize, British Honduras.        |\n| Dominion of Canada and Newfoundland | The District Paymaster, Halifax, Nova Scotia.            |\n| Cape of Good Hope              | The District Paymaster, Cape Town.                       |\n| Ceylon                          | The District Paymaster, Ceylon.                          |\n| Cyprus                          | The District Paymaster, Cyprus.                          |\n| Falkland Islands               | The Colonial Treasurer, Falkland Islands.                |\n| Fiji Islands                   | The Governor, Fiji Islands.                              |\n| Gambia                         | The District Paymaster, Sierra Leone.                    |\n| Gibraltar                      | The District Paymaster, Gibraltar.                      |\nLIST OF COLONIAL TREASURERS, DISTRICT PAYMASTERS, AND OTHER IMPERIAL AGENTS IN THE COLONIES\u2014continued.\n\n| Station                  | Designation of Agent                                      |\n|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|\n| Gold Coast               | The Colonial Treasurer, Accra, West Africa.               |\n| Hong Kong                | The District Paymaster, Hong-Kong.                        |\n| Jamaica                  | The District Paymaster, Jamaica.                          |\n| Lagos                    | The District Paymaster, Sierra Leone.                     |\n| Malta                    | The District Paymaster, Malta.                            |\n| Mauritius                | The District Paymaster, Mauritius.                        |\n| Natal                    | The District Paymaster, Pietermaritzburg, Natal.          |\n| New South Wales          | The Colonial Treasurer, Sydney, New South Wales.           |\n| New Zealand              | The Colonial Treasurer, Wellington, New Zealand.           |\n| Nova Scotia              | Included in the Dominion of Canada (see previous page).   |\n| Queensland               | The Colonial Treasurer, Brisbane, Queensland.              |\n| Sierra Leone             | The District Paymaster, Sierra Leone, West Africa.        |\n| South Australia          | The Colonial Treasurer, Adelaide, South Australia.         |\n| St. Helena               | The Acting District Paymaster, St. Helena.                |\n| Straits Settlements      | The District Paymaster, Straits Settlements.              |\n| Tasmania                 | The Colonial Treasurer, Hobart, Tasmania.                  |\n| Transvaal                | The District Paymaster, Pietermaritzburg, Natal.          |\n| Vancouver's Island        | Included in the Dominion of Canada (see previous page).   |\n| Victoria                 | The Colonial Treasurer, Melbourne, Victoria.               |\n| Western Australia        | The Colonial Treasurer, Perth, Western Australia.         |\n\nAPPENDIX No. 29.\n\nReferred to in Article 1195.\n\nRULES REGARDING THE ALLOWANCES FOR EQUIPMENT AND VOYAGE OF CERTAIN OFFICERS.\n\nRules made under the Statute 43 Vic., cap. 3, by the Secretary of State for India in Council, fixing the Allowances for Equipment and Voyage of the Governor-General of India, Members of Council of the Governor-General of India, Governors of Madras and Bombay, Commanders-in-Chief of the Forces in India, Bishops of Calcutta, Madras, and Bombay. Dated 3rd of January, 1888.\n\nI.\n\n1. The allowance for equipment and voyage of a Governor-General of India, resident in Europe at the time of his appointment, is fixed at \u00a33,500.\n\n2. Except as declared in these Rules, Government will make no arrangements for, and will defray none of the expenses connected with, the conveyance or passage of a Governor-General, his family, or suite, to or from India.\n\n3. A newly appointed Governor-General proceeding to India from Europe to enter upon his office may be accompanied by three combatant military officers for his personal staff, the expenses of whose passage will be defrayed by Government according to the rules in force in the Military Department as to military officers proceeding to India on duty.\n\n4. For an ex-Governor-General returning to Europe on resignation, a steamer belonging to the Indian Marine Service will (if consistent with the requirements of the public service) be gratuitously provided, to convey him and his family and suite to Suez; but the homeward voyage of the ship thus provided shall not be continued beyond Suez. The ex-Governor-General will bear the cost of entertainment and messing incurred while on board, in respect of himself and his party, according to the rules in force relating to the conveyance of passengers in Indian Marine troopships.\n\n5. No grant from Indian revenues will be made to any ex-Governor-General for his homeward journey from Suez.\n\n6. An ex-Governor-General returning to Europe may be accompanied by two officers of his personal staff, for whom free passages to England will be allowed according to the rules in the Military Department, and also free return passages to India, if they start on their return voyage within two months from the date of quitting India.\n\n7. In the event of a Governor-General dying, and leaving a widow in India, a steamer belonging to the Indian Marine Service will (if consistent with the requirements of the public service) be provided to convey her to Suez in like manner as in the case of an ex-Governor-General. The widow of a deceased Governor-General so returning to Europe may be accompanied by one officer of the personal staff on the\nconditions mentioned in the preceding rule, and shall bear all such expenses as would, in ordinary course, be borne by an ex-Governor-General returning to Europe.\n\nII.\n\n8.

An ex-Governor of Madras or Bombay, or an ex-Commander-in-Chief of the Forces in India, or the widow of a Governor or of a Commander-in-Chief who may die in India leaving a widow there, returning to Europe, may be accompanied by one officer of his personal staff, for whom a free passage will be allowed by Government according to the rules in force in the Military Department, and also a free return passage if he starts on the return voyage within two months from the date of quitting India.\n\nIII.\n\nII.

All Queen's cadets (British and Indian) and Honorary Queen's cadets nominated by the Secretary of State for India in Council will have the option of electing whether they will join the Royal Military College for appointment to the Staff Corps, or for commissions in British Cavalry or Infantry. The appointments in the Staff Corps remaining after the claims of the Queen's Cadets and Honorary Queen's Cadets (Indian) have been satisfied will be allotted in order of merit to successful candidates who have elected for the Indian Staff Corps at the Sandhurst Examination.\n\n3. Election shall be final, and no candidate for the Staff Corps will thereafter be eligible for transfer to the Cavalry or Infantry of the Line except by exchange.\n\n4. After the final examination at the Royal Military College a successful candidate will be gazetted as Second Lieutenant on the Unattached List of the British Army, and will be provided with passage to India. He will be required to embark within two months of being gazetted. From the date of first commission to the date of arrival in India he will receive the British pay of his rank.\n\n5. On arrival in India he will be attached to a British Regiment, and will receive Indian pay and allowances as an officer of the British Army. While so attached, leave (excepting privilege leave) may only be granted to him on medical certificate, and during any leave out of India he will be restricted to the British pay of his rank.\n\n6. At the expiration of one year's actual duty with a British Regiment (exclusive of all leave excepting privilege leave) he will be admitted to the Staff Corps in the rank of Second Lieutenant and appointed to a Native Regiment.\n\n7. At the expiration of two years and three months' service from the date of first commission (exclusive of all leave excepting privilege leave) he will be promoted to the rank of Lieutenant, provided he has passed the Examination in the native language by the Lower Standard. Should he not then have passed the Examination he will only be promoted from date of passing. An exception to this rule may be made, with the sanction of the Secretary of State for India, in the case of delay or illness resulting from field service.\n\n8. He will not be permitted to remain in the Service unless during the first three years from date of first commission his retention therein is shown to be in every respect desirable.\n\n9. Within three years of the date of his admission to the Staff Corps he will be required to pass the Higher Standard Examination in the Native Languages and the Professional Examination required under Indian Regulations.\n\n10. Until he shall have passed the above Examinations he will not be eligible to hold any permanent or officiating appointment (regimental or other) except of Squadron or Wing Officer.\n\n11. Should he not pass the Examinations within the period of three years, he will be removed from the Service and be provided with passage to Europe; he may also be allowed, at the discretion of the Government of India, a gratuity not exceeding one year's British pay of his rank.\n\n12. No extension of the period within which the Examinations must be passed will be allowed except on account of delay or illness resulting from employment on field service, and only then with the special sanction of the Secretary of State for India in Council.\n\n13. Any Officers who may from time to time be required to supplement the direct supply from Sandhurst will be drawn from the Cavalry and Infantry of the Line, and the Royal Artillery. Also, any Officer of the British Army who may show exceptional qualifications for service in India, may with the concurrence of the Secretary of State for War, be specially selected for the Indian Staff Corps. Officers appointed under this paragraph will be transferred permanently to the Staff Corps, and will not be permitted to revert to their British Regiments, except by exchange under paragraph 14, and they will come under the conditions of paragraphs 7 to 12 to such extent as those conditions may be applicable in each case. Second Lieutenants of over two years and three months' service from date of first commission will be promoted to the rank of Lieutenant on appointment, provided they have passed in the Native Languages by the Lower Standard. Officers above the rank of Second Lieutenant will carry with them the rank they hold on appointment to the Staff Corps.\n\n14.

His application must be accompanied by certificates in the Forms A1 or A2 and B, and by a declaration, in duplicate, in the Form C.\n\n3. The period of probation must be passed with Native troops, and the date of joining a Native corps shall be the date of appointment on probation.\n\n4. Should the officer not have passed the Examination in the Native languages by the lower standard before joining a Native Corps, he will be required to do so within 18 months of so joining; otherwise he will cease to be a Probationer.\n\n5. After the expiration of one year from the date of appointment on probation, the Probationer, provided he has passed the Higher Standard Examination in the Native Languages and the Professional Examination required under Regulation, may be admitted to the Staff Corps.\n\n6.

Should he not pass within this period he will be removed from the Service.\n\n9. The names of Probationers will be retained on the lists of their British Regiments until they are admitted to the Staff Corps.\n\n10. During the period of probation it will be open to the Commanding Officer of a Native Corps to report that he thinks the officer, either from temper or other cause, is unsuited for employment with Native troops; in which case the Commander-in-Chief in India, should he be satisfied that such is the case, will post the officer to his own regiment or to a battalion of it, if one be serving in India, or, if not, to any regiment or battalion in India pending orders from the Commander-in-Chief.\n\n11. The same course will be followed in the case of an officer who may not, at the expiration of 18 months' duty, be able to obtain the necessary certificates for admission to the Staff Corps.\n\n12. No officer will be allowed to resign his probationary appointment except on sufficient grounds to be approved by the Commander-in-Chief in India, the Government of India, the Secretary of State for India in Council, and the Commander-in-Chief. An officer applying for permission to resign will be required to produce a declaration and a certificate in the Forms E and F, and the Commander-in-Chief in India, if satisfied with the reason given, will at once post the officer to his own regiment or to a battalion of it, if one be serving in India, or, if not, to any regiment or battalion of the line in that country, his resignation being sent forward at once for the final orders of the Secretary of State for India and the Commander-in-Chief.\n\n13. A Probationer obtaining leave out of India, either on private affairs or for more than six months on medical certificate, will be held to have resigned his probationary appointment.\n\n14. Until the completion of three years' service a Probationer shall remain subject to the provisions of the Royal Warrant of the 5th December, 1888.*\n\n15. When an officer is ultimately admitted to the Staff Corps the date assigned to his admission shall be that of his first appointment on probation.\n\n16.

No extension of the prescribed period within which these Examinations must be passed will be allowed, except on account of illness or delay resulting from employment on field service, and only then with the special sanction of the Secretary of State for India in Council.\n\n18. An officer removed from the Service under paragraph 8 will receive a free passage to Europe and a gratuity of one year's English pay of his rank.\n\n19.

Officers of Our Corps of Royal Engineers may, with the sanction of Our Secretary of State for India in Council, elect to render continuous service to the Government of India, and the election shall be open to (1) Officers who at the date of this Our Warrant are performing their first tour of service in India, or who may hereafter proceed to India for that purpose, and who continue to serve for a second or third tour, without interruption except by leave, the election being made at any time during such service, not later than six months prior to the expiry of their third tour;* (2) Officers who are now serving on the Indian Establishment, but who have served part of their time elsewhere than in India; (3) Officers who having previously served in India are now serving on the British Establishment; (the election in each of the latter classes to be made on or before the 1st October, 1886\u2020).\n\n2. Officers electing for such continuous service shall enjoy the conditions of Indian pay and allowances at present existing, subject to such modifications of the same as may at any time appear expedient.\n\n3. They shall be eligible for leave under the conditions applicable to Officers admitted to Our Indian Staff Corps on or after the date of this Our Warrant.\n\n4. They shall be subject to the same regulations as to military promotion, and liability to removal from the effective list, as apply to the other Officers of Our Royal Engineers.\n\n5. They shall be required, should occasion arise, to serve elsewhere than on the Indian Establishment.\n\n6. They shall be allowed, under conditions to be laid down by Our Secretary of State for India in Council, and with his sanction and that of Our Secretary of State for War, to exchange with Officers of the Corps serving on the British Establishment.\n\n7. They shall be liable, in view to their becoming acquainted with the progress made in military science and engineering, and to their qualifying themselves for promotion in their Corps, to return to England to do duty at the School of Military Engineering, for such periods and under such conditions as may, from time to time, be prescribed by Our Secretary of State for India in Council in concurrence with Our Secretary of State for War, and such duty shall count as service for Indian pension.\n\n8. The Regulations under which, with the view of securing the flow of promotion in Our Corps of Royal Engineers, Officers of the Corps may be placed on half pay or retired, shall not be held to disqualify the Officers on the Indian Establishment so affected from continuing to hold any appointments in the Civil Departments of the Government of India which they may have been holding previously, and, subject to the discretion of the Government of India, their tenure of such appointments shall be regulated by the Rules which apply to other persons holding similar appointments in the same Departments.\n\n9. Officers permitted to elect for continuous Indian service shall be eligible, except as is hereinafter laid down, for pensions under the conditions and at the rates applicable to Officers admitted to our Staff Corps after the 1st July, 1881.\n\n10. Service for pension shall be reckoned from date of first commission, and it shall include all service on the effective list and on the half pay or retired list provided for in Article 8 of this Our Warrant.\n\n11. An Officer serving on the Indian Establishment at the date of this Our Warrant, who has served part of his time elsewhere than in India, or an Officer serving on the British Establishment at the same date, who may hereafter proceed to India, shall on retirement receive a pension consisting of the retired pay to which he would be entitled under Our Warrant regulating the retired pay of Our Royal Engineers generally, and, in addition, such a portion of the difference between the said retired pay and the Staff Corps pension belonging to his total length of service as is represented by the proportion his Indian service bears to the minimum total service that would have qualified him for the before-mentioned Staff Corps pension. In calculating the period of Indian service for pension, three years of British service shall be reckoned as Indian service.\n\n12. Should an Officer retire before he has served a sufficient time to entitle him to a pension under the rules applicable to the Staff Corps as aforesaid, he shall be granted only such retired pay or gratuity as he would have been entitled to receive under Our Warrant regulating the retired pay of Officers of Our Royal Engineers generally had he not elected for continuous Indian Service.\n\n13. Officers who have already had periods of leave under conditions which allowed them to count such periods as service for pension shall, in the event of their volunteering for permanent service in India, be allowed the benefit of counting such periods towards pension under the conditions of this Our Warrant.\n\n14. Officers of the permanent Indian Establishment transferred to the half pay list on account of ill health shall come under the same conditions as Officers of the Indian Staff Corps.\n\n15. Our Secretary of State for India in Council shall be the sole administrator and interpreter of this Our Warrant, and shall be empowered to issue such instructions in reference thereto as he may from time to time deem necessary.\n\nGiven at Our Court at Windsor, this twentieth day of February, 1886, and in the forty-ninth year of Our Reign.\n\nBy Her Majesty's Command,\n\nKIMBERLEY.\n\n* As modified by Royal Warrant of 19th April, 1890.\n\u2020 Altered to 1st November, 1886, by a subsequent Warrant.\nROYAL ENGINEERS.\n\nRegulations under which Officers of Royal Engineers, who elect for continuous service in India, are appointed to the Indian Class at the School of Military Engineering, Chatham, under Article 7 of the Royal Warrant of 20th February, 1886.\n\n(Reprint of India Army Circulars, February, 1891, Clause 29.)\n\nWith the sanction of the Right Honourable the Secretary of State for India, His Excellency the Governor-General in Council is pleased to direct the publication of the following Regulations for the appointment of Officers of Royal Engineers, who elect for continuous service in India, to the School of Military Engineering at Chatham, in supersession of the Regulations published in India Army Circulars, clauses 176 of 1887, 33 of 1888, and 176 of 1890:\n\n1. Every officer of Royal Engineers who has elected to render continuous service to the Government of India under the terms of the Royal Warrant of the 20th February, 1886, will be required, after he has been one year a captain and before he has been eight years in that rank, to join the School of Military Engineering at Chatham, with a view to becoming acquainted with the progress made in military science and engineering, and to qualify himself for promotion in his corps.\n\n2. The course of instruction will last about eight months, commencing on the 1st April.\n\n3. The number of such officers who will be appointed to the School of Military Engineering in any one year will not exceed 15. They will be selected by the Government of India.\n\n4. If in India when appointed, the officer will travel at the public expense, and be provided with passage to England by troopship, and if he return to India on the completion of the course he will be provided with a return passage. He will also receive travelling expenses as from port of embarkation to Chatham, and again as from Chatham to port of embarkation.\n\n5. From date of embarking from India to date of return as above he will receive English pay and Engineer pay of rank. Servant's allowance will also be granted from date of arrival in England to date of embarkation on return, and also for the period of the voyage, except in a troopship, provided that the officer is accompanied by his civilian servant. He will, in addition, while at the School, be entitled to quarters or the usual allowance in lieu and to fuel and light allowance.\n\n6. In the case of an officer appointed to the School while on leave, the period of duty will commence from the date on which he joins at Chatham, and he will receive the above allowances, &c., from that date. He will have no claim to travelling allowances prior to joining, but if he returns to India at the earliest opportunity after completing the course, he will be granted travelling expenses to port of embarkation and a free passage, and be considered on duty up to the date of his arrival in that country.\n\n7. An officer may, on obtaining the assent of his Government, be granted leave on the termination of the course of instruction, or, if on leave when appointed, be allowed to avail himself of any unexpired portion of that leave, but in either case his duty will terminate at the date of quitting the School, and he will forfeit his claim to a free passage back to India.\n\n8. The whole period passed on duty will reckon as service for pension, and also, in the case of an officer under the Civil Service Regulations, for furlough.\n\n9. Every officer is expected, while at Chatham, to pass the examination qualifying him for promotion to the rank of Major, as under no circumstances will an officer be ordered there for a second time.\n\n10. It is to be distinctly understood that an officer who chooses to pass in India the prescribed examination for promotion to the rank of Major will still be required to do duty at Chatham for eight months, in order to make himself acquainted with the progress made in military science and engineering.\n\n11. If, under special circumstances, it is found inexpedient to order home a continuous Indian service Captain of Royal Engineers previous to his promotion to the rank of regimental Major, the officer will be directed to join the School of Military Engineering for the purpose of going through the prescribed course of instruction as soon after his promotion as his services can be spared.\n\n12. Royal Engineer Officers, who have elected for continuous service in India, if appointed while on furlough to the School of Military Engineering at Chatham under Article 7 of the Royal Warrant of 20th February, 1886, may, if they desire it, draw furlough pay and allowances in lieu of English pay and allowances while going through the Chatham course.\n\nThe only allowance that can be drawn with furlough pay is lodging allowance at the Indian rate when the officer is not provided with quarters.\nQUEEN'S INDIA CADETSHIPS.\n\n1. The claims of all Candidates who are eligible for nomination as Queen's India Cadets are brought forward half-yearly (in the spring and in the autumn) for consideration by the Secretary of State for India in Council, and the nominations are then conferred on the Candidates whose claims are found to be highest, under certain prescribed and established conditions.\n\n2. A Candidate is not eligible for nomination as a Queen's India Cadet if he be under 17 or over 19 years of age on the first of July for nomination in the previous spring, and on the first of December for nomination in the previous autumn.\n\n3. A Candidate is not eligible for nomination as a Queen's India Cadet until he is prepared to attend the entrance examination next following the date of nomination. If, however, he has already been certified by the Civil Service Commissioners as qualified for admission to the Royal Military College, he is eligible for nomination, so long as he is within the prescribed limits of age.\n\n4. If a Candidate who has been nominated in view of his attending the next entrance examination, does not succeed at that examination in qualifying for admission to the Royal Military College, his nomination lapses; but if at any subsequent allotment of Cadetships he is still within the prescribed limits of age, his claims are invariably brought forward for consideration in the same manner as those of all other eligible Candidates. No further application need be submitted by him.\n\n5. The expenses of Queen's India Cadets at the Royal Military College are not payable by the State, except in cases where, after due inquiry, their pecuniary circumstances are ascertained to be such as to justify the payment.\n\nHONORARY QUEEN'S INDIA CADETSHIPS.\n\n6. Honorary Queen's India Cadets will be appointed from\u2014\n\n(a.) The sons of officers of the Indian Army, who were killed in action, or who have died of wounds received in action within six months of such wounds having been received, or from illness brought on by fatigue, privation, or exposure incident to active operations in the field before an enemy, within six months after their having been first certified to be ill.\n\n(b.) The sons of officers of the Indian Army, who have attained the brevet or substantive rank of Major or Lieutenant-Colonel, and have performed long or distinguished service.\n\n7. A Candidate for nomination as an Honorary Queen's India Cadet is not eligible for nomination, and his claims are in no circumstances considered, until he has already attended an examination and obtained qualifying marks in the manner prescribed in the \"Regulations respecting admission to the Royal Military College, Sandhurst\" (published by the War Office).\n\n8. Only three Honorary Queen's India Cadetships are at the disposal of the Secretary of State for India in each year, the allotment being made in the month of January, when the claims are considered of all Candidates who have already qualified and were within the limits of 17 and 19 years of age on the first day of the previous December.\n\n9. An Honorary Queen's India Cadetship carries with it no pecuniary advantage.\n\nGENERAL RULES REGARDING BOTH CLASSES OF INDIA CADETSHIPS.\n\n10. The prescribed form of application can be procured from the India Office. It should be filled up and submitted by the Candidate himself, and not by anyone acting on his behalf. Unless the Candidate has reached 17 years of age, and is prepared to attend the next entrance examination, his application will be returned to him for submission at the proper time.\n\n11. After a Candidate for nomination as a Queen's India Cadet or as an Honorary Queen's India Cadet has been recorded on the list at the India Office, no further application should be made by him or on his behalf. All the necessary communications will be addressed to him direct.\n\n12. A Candidate for nomination as a Queen's India Cadet or as an Honorary Queen's India Cadet should immediately report to the India Office any change of his address, and he should also report any material changes in his family, such as the death of his father or mother.\n\n13. All Candidates have to make their own arrangements with the War Office for attending the examinations.\n\nThere are no India Cadetships at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich.\n\nNOTE REGARDING QUEEN'S CADETSHIPS.\n\nQueen's Cadets are appointed by the Secretary of State for War. The sons of officers of the Indian Army are not eligible for appointment.\nLEAVE RULES FOR THE INDIAN STAFF CORPS.\n\n(India Army Circulars, April, 1886, Clause 51, published 16th April, with subsequent decisions.)\n\nI. An officer may be granted,\u2014\nPrivilege leave under such regulations as may from time to time be in force.\nLeave out of India, for no longer period than one year, capable of extension to two years' absence from duty, on the following pay:\u2014\n\n| After appointment to the Staff Corps | ... ... 200 a year. |\n|--------------------------------------|-------------------|\n| After the commencement of the 5th year's service for pension | ... ... 250 \" |\n| Do., do., 15th, do., do., do. 300 \" |\n| Do., do., 20th, do., do., do., do. 450 \" |\n| Do., do., 25th, do., do., do., do., do. 600 \" |\n| Do., do., 30th, do., do., do., do., do., do. 700 \" |\n\nLeave in India, but for the period of one year only, on full military pay, and half the Staff salary of appointment.\n\nII. No extension of leave involving absence from duty for more than two years, whether taken in or out of India, can be granted except on specially urgent grounds and without pay.\n\nIII. An officer unable on account of the state of his health to return to duty within the maximum period of two years' absence, will, unless he is under rule 2 specially granted an extension of leave without pay, be placed on temporary half pay or the retired list, as the circumstances of the case may seem to require. An officer will also be liable to be placed on half pay or the retired list should his health require an undue amount of leave, whether in or out of India. This power will be exercised at the instance of the Government of India should the officer be in India, or, should he be at home, by the Secretary of State in Council.\n\nIV. All leave, in or out of India, will count as service for pension.\n\nV. Leave, whether it is leave in India or leave out of India, will not involve forfeiture of appointment, and may be granted at any time, but solely at the discretion of the Commanders-in-Chief of the several armies for officers serving directly under their orders, and by the Governor-General in Council or the Governors in Council for officers of civil departments of the army or of Corps not under the direct orders of a Commander-in-chief.\n\nVI. An officer on leave, whether in India or out of India, will be required to rejoin at once on being recalled to duty, unless certified by a Medical Board as unfit to do so.\n\nVII. The above rules shall apply to\u2014\nOfficers whose admission to the Staff Corps shall bear date subsequent to the 30th June, 1886.\nOfficers of the Staff Corps, including probationers, or of the Cavalry and Infantry lists of the Indian Army, in military employment, who may elect them within twelve months of that date.\nOfficers in civil employ on that date, subsequently reverting to military duty, may elect them within six months from the date of being replaced at the disposal of the Military Department. If such officers who may be on leave when so replaced must make their election at once. Those taking leave within the six months must make their election before going on leave.\n\nThey shall not apply to\u2014\nOfficers in permanent civil employ.\nOfficers commanding districts or holding other appointments under special regulations as to leave of absence, who continue subject to such regulations.\n\nVIII. Officers who, under Rule VII, have elected to come under these rules count all previous leave as service for pension. The position of those who have not elected them remains unchanged.\n\nIX. The Secretary of State in Council reserves the right of making any change in the foregoing regulations which circumstances may require.\n\nOfficers who have not elected for the above rules in the manner and within the period laid down in Rule VII have no further opportunity of election, but remain under previous rules. It must also be clearly understood that no modifications of the existing codes will be sanctioned, and that there is no middle course between abiding by them and acceptance of these new rules.\n\nMilitary officers in civil employ on 30th June, 1886, who may desire to retire direct from such employment, have, on such retirement, the option of electing the new rules.\n\nWhen it may be necessary to convert sterling rates of pay under these rules into rupee currency, or vice versa, the conversion will be made at the rate of exchange in force for the period when the pay became due, as fixed annually for the adjustment of financial transactions between the Indian and Imperial Governments.\n\nThe rules which govern the allowances of officers acting for absentees remain unchanged.\n\nINDIAN MEDICAL SERVICE.\n\nThe rules laid down for the grant of leave to officers of the Indian Staff Corps apply equally to officers of the Indian Medical Service in military employ, with the following modification in regard to the rates of pay whilst on leave out of India:\u2014\n\n| After arrival in India | ... ... 200 a year. |\n|------------------------|-------------------|\n| After the commencement of the 5th year's service for pension | ... ... 250 \" |\n| Ditto, ditto, 10th ditto | ... ... 300 \" |\n| Ditto, ditto, 15th ditto | ... ... 400 \" |\n| Ditto, ditto, 20th ditto | ... ... 450 \" |\n| Ditto, ditto, 25th ditto | ... ... 500 \" |\n\nThe rules apply to all Medical Officers admitted to the service after the 30th June, 1886, and to officers who may elect them under the provisions of Rule VII.\n\nSUBSIDIARY RULES.\n\n1. Officers in permanent civil employment, while they continue in such employment, are not affected by these rules; but if desirous of retiring on pension direct from such employment, they will, whether on duty or on furlough, be given the benefit of the rule which allows all previous leave to count as service for pension.\n\nIt is, however, to be clearly understood that\nno officer in civil employment will be allowed to place himself out of employment for the purpose of taking leave under these rules, or for any purpose but immediate retirement.\n\n2. Leave in or out of India commences on the date an officer is \"struck off duty,\" which means the date following the day of relief, and terminates on, and includes, the day preceding the date on which he rejoins his regiment or appointment on return from leave; the only exception being in the case of leave out of India on medical certificate, when the precise amount recommended by a Medical Board to be necessary in any case reckons from the date on which the vessel in which he embarks quits her moorings or anchorage, and terminates on the date preceding that on which he rejoins his regiment or appointment on return.\n\nIt is the duty of the immediate superior of an officer to see that there is no undue delay between the date of his being \"struck off duty\" and that of his appearing before a Medical Board, and also that he proceeds to the port of embarkation thereafter without any avoidable delay. The invalided officer should likewise be distinctly informed that he must quit India as early as possible after he has received permission to do so.\n\n3. In the case of an officer obliged to leave his station to appear before a Medical Board at another station, the date of being \"struck off duty\" will mean the date he is permitted to quit the station where he is examined and invalided. An officer so circumstanced is entitled to full pay and Staff salary up to and for the date preceding that on which he is permitted to quit the station where he is examined and invalided.\n\n4. Under these rules, absence from duty with pay, which is restricted to two years, is reckoned from the date of being \"struck off duty\" to date of rejoining appointment or regiment.\n\n5. Up to date of leaving India, and from date of return to India to date of rejoining regiment or appointment, an officer granted leave out of India under these rules will receive Indian pay and half staff salary, provided, in any case, the two years' absence from duty is not exceeded.\n\n6. An officer subject to these rules who holds a permanent departmental or regimental staff appointment, promoted while on leave out of India, is only entitled, from date of debarkation in India to that of joining his appointment, to the Indian pay and allowances of his rank, and the half staff salary of the appointment he held at the time he proceeded on leave.\n\n7. An officer holding a permanent departmental or regimental staff appointment, promoted while on leave in India, will draw the Indian pay and allowances of his rank, and the half staff salary of the appointment he held at the time he proceeded on leave, until he assumes charge of the duties of the appointment to which he has been promoted.\n\n8. The Indian Pension Regulations are unaffected by these leave rules, except that all leave from date of commencement of service for pension will, under them, be allowed to count as service for pension.\n\n9. Time passed at Addiscombe after the attainment of the age of 16 years will reckon as service for pension in calculating the rates of pay under Rule I.\n\n10. The periods of service for pension in Rule I of the leave rules will entitle an officer taking leave to the pay fixed for such periods of service, without any limitation based on the rule* which prevents an officer from retiring on the pension fixed for a particular period of service, unless he has served half of that service in the Staff Corps.\n\n11. The provisions of the rules with regard to duration of leave do not apply to probationers of the Staff Corps.\n\n12. The limit of two years laid down for leave will not apply to time spent at the Staff College, which counts as duty.\n\n13. Officers recalled from leave granted under these rules will be given free passage to India, or not, according to the Transport Regulations in force at the time.\n\n14. Advances of pay to officers proceeding on and returning from leave out of India will be granted as heretofore.\n\n15. Extensions of leave, except on medical certificate or in special or urgent cases in which the Secretary of State decides according to circumstances, cannot be granted without the assent of the proper authority in India as defined in Clause V of the rules.\n\n16. Extensions of leave beyond one year under these rules are not claimable in any way as a right, but are admissible only at the discretion of the proper authority, and then on special and urgent grounds.\n\n17. An officer subject to these rules on promotion to Major-General, or on attainment of Colonel's allowance, cannot be granted leave under them, and, if permitted to reside in England or elsewhere out of India, is restricted to the English pay of his rank.\n\n18. Officers subject to these rules, who are in the following categories, and who entered the Indian Army or Staff Corps before the 1st July, 1881, may elect to reside out of India on the allowances admissible under them until succession to the Colonel's allowance or promotion to Major-General, whichever may happen first; or to remain in India on the unemployed Indian pay and allowances of their rank if unemployed:\n\n(a) Officers vacating regimental commands, remaining in the service for the attainment of the highest retirement pension, or the Colonel's allowance.\n\n(b) Officers over 55 years of age, who may be required under the rules to vacate staff, departmental, or civil appointments, and for whom other suitable employment cannot be found.\n\n(c) Officers of the Commissariat, Military Accounts, and Judge Advocate General's Department, who vacate their appointments on attaining to 52 years of age.\n\n---\n\n*Army Regulations, India, Vol. I, Part I, Article 1333, Clause (e).\n(d) Officers who on the 8th August, 1884, were holding appointments of unlimited tenure to which they were appointed before the 1st January, 1884, and who vacate their appointments on completing seven years' tenure from date of appointment or such further extension as may be granted to enable them to complete 32 years' service for pension not exceeding nine years in all.\n\nG. G. O. 432 of 1884, Clause VII.\n\n(e) Squadron or wing commanders who vacate their appointments on attaining 52 years of age.\n\n(f) Colonels who entered the Staff Corps after the 12th September, 1866, and before the 1st July, 1881, and Colonels of the General List, after transfer to Secretary of State's Despatch No. 6, dated 6th January, 1887.\n\nThe limit of absence from duty imposed by the leave rules will not be held applicable to these officers.\n\n19. Officers who may have entered civil employment after the 30th June, 1886, and before the 1st July, 1887, without having elected the leave rules for the Staff Corps, will be entitled, on reverting to military duty, to elect them under the conditions laid down in the third clause of Rule VII. (See note to next paragraph.)\n\n20. Officers who may have entered permanent civil employment after the 30th June, 1886, having previously elected the leave rules for the Staff Corps, and officers who may have entered the Staff Corps under those rules and subsequently taken civil employment, are absolutely under the leave rules contained in the Civil Service Regulations so long as they remain in civil employment, but on reverting to military duty within ten years of their entry into civil employment, as allowed under G. G. O. No. 135 of 1884, they again come under these rules.\n\nNote.\u2014An officer does not come under civil rules by reason of being transferred to a civil appointment, the tenure of which is limited to a definite period, nor by officiating for less than three years in the civil department.\n\n21. Officers struck off the effective list of the army under the provisions of G. G. O. No. 135 of 1884, after ten years' absence from military duty, cannot elect or revert to the leave rules for the Staff Corps, except for the purpose of immediate retirement, with the advantage of counting all leave as service for pension, as provided for in paragraph 1.\n\n22. The service for furlough of an officer, who at the time of coming under the civil leave rules, was subject to the leave rules for the Staff Corps, is calculated in accordance with the civil leave rules retrospectively from the date of his arrival in India, i.e., he is credited with an amount of furlough equivalent to one-fourth of his active service, less any leave out of India actually taken.\n\nIt is notified that all officers in military employ, irrespective of rank or the furlough or leave regulations to which they may be subject, who require an extension on private affairs of their furlough or leave out of India, must obtain the previous assent of the authorities in India under whom they may be serving, to apply for such extension.\n\nThis permission, when obtained, must be attached to their application to the India Office for the required extension.\n\nNote.\u2014This memorandum has been compiled for easy reference, but it is not intended for quotation as of official authority.\n\nIndia Office,\nAugust, 1893.\nMILITARY FURLOUGH RULES OF 1868,\n\nWith subsequent amendments.\n\nGENERAL ORDER BY THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA, DATED 25TH FEBRUARY, 1874,\nNo. 171.\n\nThe Rules previously in force will be designated, as heretofore, the Furlough Rules of 1796\nand 1854.\n\nThe following G. G. O. are cancelled prospectively from the 1st January, 1875:\u2014\n\nG. G. O. No. 630 of 1869 (1st Clause).\nG. G. O. No. 627 of 1870.\nG. G. O. No. 613 of 1871.\n\n2. These rules are applicable to all officers who, on the 1st July, 1868, belonged to the several\nIndian Staff Corps, or to the Indian Army, and who have elected, or may elect, to adopt them: officers of the British\nArmy who entered the Staff Corps after that date are of\ncourse subject to them.\n\nRules apply to Officers of Staff Corps and Indian Army.\n\n(2.) In regard to the periods of leave of absence during which appointments may be held, and\nin regard to the increased allowances, they are also applicable\nto officers of the Royal Artillery and Royal Engineers, late of\nthe Indian Army, holding permanent staff appointments not\nof a regimental nature, and to such officers of the Engineers\nof the Imperial Establishment as may be permanently em-\nployed on the staff in India.\n\nAlso to Officers of R.A. and R.E., late of Indian Army, when\nholding permanent non-regimental appointments.\n\n(3.) But should an officer of the British Service, holding such permanent staff appointment, be\nallowed to proceed on leave under circumstances which, by these rules, would involve loss of\nappointment, he cannot take leave under them, but simply as a British Officer holding no appoint-\nment.\n\n3. These rules are not applicable to officers on the Invalid or Invalid Pension Establishment,\nDo not apply to Invalid Officers.\n\n4. They are not applicable to regimental officers generally of the British Service, whether\nNor to Regimental Officers of the British Service, even though formerly\nof Indian Army.\n\nNOTE (1.)\u2014British Medical Staff Officers holding administrative appointments in India tenable\nfor five years, who are compelled by ill health to return to England, will be allowed by the Govern-\nment of India in the Military Department to proceed there to appear before a Medical Board, and\nif reported unfit for further service in India, will be removed from the Indian Establishment; if\notherwise, they may be allowed by the Secretary of State for India six months' leave on medical\ncertificate on their Indian allowances and half staff.\n\nSuch officers are also eligible for four months' leave on private affairs without pay, but only one\ngrant of leave will be allowed out of India during their tenure of office.\n\nNOTE (2.)\u2014All British Officers holding Staff appointments in India, except the command of\nDivisions and Brigades, will be allowed, during their five years' tenure of office, only one grant of\nleave out of India either on medical certificate for six months with absentee allowances regulated\nunder the furlough rules of 1868, or on private affairs for four months, with British pay, from\nIndian revenues. Any leave obtained in excess of either of these periods will involve loss of\nappointment.\n\n5. They are applicable to officers of the Royal Engineers on the Imperial Establishment, who\nApply to R.E. Officers on the Imperial list holding permanent non-\nregimental staff appointments.\n\n(2.) These officers, therefore, and other Royal Engineer Officers of the Imperial List on\npermanent staff employ under the Government, will be entitled to a furlough of two years after\neight years' service in India, or at the expiration of one year from the date of their return (for a\nsecond tour of service in India) on the completion of the prescribed home service after the first\nperiod of seven years' service in India.\n\n(3.) Such officers will be allowed an advance of passage money, or free passage in a troopship\nif proceeding in the trooping season; the advance to be refunded on receipt of the balance of\nfurlough pay. The English rate of pay of their rank only will be passed to them during their leave;\nbut at its conclusion, on their presenting an order for them to return to India, the difference between\nthat rate and furlough pay, less the passage money they have received, will be paid to them in\nEngland, conditionally on its refund, if the order to return to India is not carried out.\n\n(4.) Those Royal Engineer Officers who arrived in India before the 1st July, 1872, are, however,\nnot subject to the provisions of the preceding clause as long as they do not exchange Indian for\nHome Service, but draw furlough pay during furlough, as others.\n\nNOTE.\u2014Royal Engineers of the Imperial List may receive their pay while on furlough, either\nunder the regulations in force before February, 1873, or under the terms of General Order No. 123 of\n1873, that is to say, an officer of Engineers of the Imperial List may, at his option, on taking\nfurlough to England, either receive furlough pay on the understanding that, should he not return to\nIndia, he will have to refund the difference between it* and English pay, less the regulated amount of passage money, or a free passage and English pay only during the period of his furlough, the difference between English pay and furlough pay, less the cost of his passage, being issued to him upon his return to duty in India.\n\n2. The officer's choice should be made at the time of applying for furlough, and should be noted on his last pay certificate.\n\n(5.) An officer of the British Service, holding permanent staff employ under the Government, who may proceed on furlough under circumstances which involve the forfeiture of his appointment, must obtain the furlough as a British Regimental Officer, and it will reckon as a portion of the aggregate eight years of furlough on pay to which an officer is restricted during his service by Rule XVI. But, on again becoming permanently employed, he resumes the right of obtaining furlough under these rules.\n\n6. Officers of British Regiments who may join the Staff Corps can count as service towards furlough all their military service in India, provided that half of it (in no case less than four years) shall have been passed in the Staff Corps. But any leave to England they may have taken during service so counted will be reckoned as furlough already taken. Officers of the British Service who formerly belonged to the Indian Armies are exempted from the above proviso.\n\n7. These rules apply also to all Warrant Officers holding Veteran or Honorary Commissions, who may elect them; the period of service qualifying for furlough being calculated from the date of the attainment of a Commission. They will receive during furlough half their total receipts, calculated as laid down in Rule V, but without any reference to a minimum or maximum rate. Warrant Officers not holding Commissions can obtain furlough under these rules only on medical certificate.\n\n(2.) Such furlough may be for two years with retention of appointment and half of the aggregate allowances; but any extension of such leave (which will not be granted for more than one year in excess of the two years) or any leave taken within less than three years from the date of last return to duty, will be on \"English furlough pay.\" [See Note (i) to para. 9.]\n\n8. Every Warrant Officer who attained warrant rank before the 19th February, 1869, and who has not made his election, will be required, on the first occasion of his applying for leave out of India, to state whether he desires to take the leave under these rules, or under those previously in force applicable to Warrant Officers, viz., G. G. O. Nos. 518 and 531 of 1854, G. G. O. No. 1559 of 1857, and subsequent orders. That election will be considered final.\n\n(2.) Those who became Warrant Officers after 19th February, 1869, are subject to these rules, and cannot elect any of the previous rules.\n\n(3.) Leave on medical certificate on Indian pay and allowances to places eastward of the Cape, as allowed to Commissioned Officers under the Furlough Rules of 1796, is not in any case admissible to a Warrant Officer.\n\n(4.) These rules respecting Warrant Officers apply to Honorary Assistant Surgeons and Warrant Officers in the Medical Department.\n\n9. The term \"Furlough Pay\" having now a changed and two-fold signification, in all future orders and references \"Furlough Pay\" will be understood as the half Indian salary within the prescribed limits, specified in paragraph V of these rules, converted at the rate of exchange fixed by the Secretary of State for the official year, whilst \"English Furlough Pay\" will represent the rates heretofore allowed to the several grades as English Pay under the rules of 1796 and 1854.\n\nNote (i).\u2014Where in these rules English Furlough Pay is mentioned as that to which an officer is to be restricted, the rates laid down in paragraph 11 of G. G. O. No. 69, dated 22nd January, 1868, and (for Medical Warrant Officers) paragraph 22 of G. G. O. No. 550 of 1868, are to be understood as intended in the cases of Warrant Officers.\n\nNote (2).\u2014Officers who elected these rules prior to 1st July, 1871, or before G. G. O. No. 588 of 1871 reached their stations, will receive furlough pay at the exchange of 2s. the rupee.\n\nRULES.\n\nI.\u2014The distinction with respect to allowances which has been hitherto drawn between furlough on private affairs and sick leave, is abolished, both kinds of leave being included under the general term furlough, provision, however, being made for the obtainment of furlough under medical certificate, without all the restrictions applicable to furlough when taken without medical certificate.\n\n* Under the terms of India Army Circul'ars, 1886, Clause 196, Indian furlough pay for the following periods is not subject to refund on reversion to the Imperial Establishment:\n\n| After 8 years' Indian Service, 1 year. | After 12 years' Indian Service, 1 year 8 months. |\n|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| \" 9 \"                                | \" 13 \"                                         |\n| \" 10 \"                               | \" 14 \"                                         |\n| \" 11 \"                               | \" 2 years.                                     |\n\nAfter 8 years' Indian Service, 1 year. After 12 years' Indian Service, 1 year 8 months.\nII.\u2014Leave taken under the rules now prescribed will not involve forfeiture of appointment, except in the cases herein specially provided for.\n\n2. Officers of the Staff Corps and Local Indian Service, and Officers on the General List, can retain their appointments during all leave of absence granted by competent authority. But their pay during such absence will be the same as they would obtain under these rules had this exemption from forfeiture of appointment not been granted.\n\nNote.\u2014The above rule is applicable to all Military and Medical Officers taking furlough or leave under these Regulations.\n\nIII.\u2014The rules now prescribed do not affect the provisions of Act XXXIII of George III, Chapter 52, Section 70,* but an absentee cannot retain his appointment and draw absentee allowances, except under the rules now prescribed. Nor do they affect the regulations by which General Officers Commanding Divisions and Brigades can only obtain limited periods of leave without forfeiting their Commands.\n\nIV.\u2014Leave of absence will in future be of three kinds, viz.:\n\nI.\u2014Furlough in or out of India.\nII.\u2014General leave on private affairs or sick certificate in India, or short leave to sea.\nIII.\u2014Privilege leave.\n\nChapter I.\n\nFurlough.\n\nV.\u2014An officer drawing staff pay in addition to pay of rank, proceeding on Furlough, will be allowed pay at the rate of 50 per cent. of the salary of his substantive office.\n\n2. But an officer in Civil employ and drawing consolidated salary, will be allowed 50 per cent. of the average salary drawn by him during the three years prior to his proceeding on Furlough, or during his actual service in India should that be less than three years; and the time spent and the allowances drawn during any leave other than \"Privilege Leave,\" will be omitted in the calculation of average salary.\n\n3. No absentee shall in either case draw more than \u00a31,000, or less than \u00a3250 per annum.\n\nNote.\u2014Should the Furlough pay of an officer in Civil employ be less than the Furlough pay of his substantive military rank, the difference will be paid to him as a charge against the department from which he draws his pay.\n\nWhen the Indian Furlough pay of a military officer (combatant or medical) is less than his English Furlough pay, he is entitled to the latter.\n\n4. The term \"salary\" will signify the total amount drawn by an officer, whether as consolidated pay, or staff allowances in addition to pay, but will not include any extra or special allowances. But in the case of a military officer in Civil employ, his acting allowances shall be taken into account as a part of his salary in calculating his Furlough pay.\n\n5. An officer absent on Furlough, who may be transferred to another office during his absence, shall be entitled, for the entire period of his Furlough, to Furlough Pay at the rate sanctioned to him when leaving India, whatever the salary of the office to which he may be transferred may be. This Furlough pay will be continued to an officer in military employ after his return to India and until he joins his appointment, provided it is not less than the military pay, or pay and allowances of his rank.\n\n6. But an officer whose term of office shall lapse, who shall vacate his appointment, or whose appointment shall be abolished during his Furlough, will revert at once to the Furlough pay which he would draw in virtue of his rank, as laid down below, in Section 8. Any case of sudden abolition of appointment may, however, be specially considered in the department of the Government under which the officer may have been employed. An officer will also be entitled to the benefit of his promotion to a higher Staff Corps or regimental rank, whilst on Furlough, subject to the maximum limit.\n\n* The Section referred to is quoted below:\n\nSection 70.\u2014\"And be it further enacted that no person who shall have held any civil or military station whatever in India, in the service of the said United Company, being under the rank or degree of a Member of Council or Commander-in-Chief of the forces, and who, having departed from India by leave of the Governor-General in Council, shall not return to India within the space of five years next after such departure, shall be entitled to any rank or restoration of office, or be capable of again serving in India, either in the European or Native Corps of Troops or in the civil line of the Company's Service, unless in the case of any Civil Servant of the Company, it shall be proved to the satisfaction of the Court of Directors that such absence was occasioned by sickness or infirmity or, unless such person be permitted to return with his rank to India, by a vote or resolution passed by way of ballot by three parts in four of the proprietors assembled in General Court, specially convened for that purpose, whereof eight days' previous notice of the time and purpose of such meeting shall be given in The London Gazette, or unless, in the case of any Military Officer, it shall be proved to the satisfaction of the said Court of Directors and the Board of Commissioners for the affairs of India that such absence was occasioned by sickness or infirmity, or some inevitable accident.\"\nOfficers holding regimental medical charges retained during Furlough.\n\n* G.G.O. No. 1060 of 23rd Dec., 1864, para. 9.\nG.G.O. No. 370 of 4th April, 1867, para. 9.\n\nOfficers not in staff employ will receive half the Indian pay of their rank, provided that an officer entitled to Furlough shall in no case receive less than the above minimum of \u00a3250 per annum.\n\nMinimum Furlough pay.\n\nNote.\u2014Officers who may be entitled to income allowance from the military fund during absence in Europe, will draw their half salary or minimum absentee allowance under the foregoing clause, subject to a deduction equivalent to the amount of such income allowance.\n\nVI.\u2014All grants of Furlough on private affairs subject to the exigencies of the service.\n\nNote.\u2014It is therefore within the competency of Local Governments and of the Commander-in-Chief to decline to forward the application of any officer whose absence would, in their opinion, be detrimental to the interests of the public service, until such time as arrangements can be made for removing the difficulty; and department to decline to forward any application for Furlough cannot be spared without risking the efficiency of the department, any doubtful case being referred for the orders of Government.\n\nVII.\u2014The maximum amount of Furlough on private affairs to be taken at any one time carrying pay and retention of appointment, will be two years; any extension of such Furlough will be without pay unless it is on medical certificate, see Rule XIII. (But see Notes (3) and (4) Rule IX.) And no extension on private affairs beyond two years will be granted, though without pay, except upon satisfactory evidence of very urgent necessity.\n\nVIII.\u2014A period of at least three years' service after return from last Furlough, except Furlough for a period not exceeding six months under Rule XI (and excepting also, in the case of an officer in Civil employ, ordinary furlough not exceeding three months) must be completed before Furlough can again be taken, unless obtained under medical certificate (see Rules XIII and XIV and Note 3 of Rule IX).\n\nNote (1).\u2014An officer in Civil employ cannot reckon in this interval of three years any period of absence from actual duty, except Privilege Leave.\n\nNote (2).\u2014Although Furlough not exceeding three months taken by officers in civil employ is not considered as Furlough requiring an interval of three years' duty, such Furlough will be excluded from the period of three years' service required between two Furloughs.\n\n2. But an officer who may be ordered to return to duty before the completion of his Furlough for the purpose of proceeding on field service may be allowed to take the balance of such Furlough at any time.\n\nIX.\u2014An officer will be eligible for two years' Furlough on the completion of eight years' active service in India (see para. 6 of this order); for a third year after a further period of six years' actual service, and for a fourth and fifth year after similar intervals of six years, and so on, up to the maximum prescribed in Rule XVI. The grant of Furlough to an officer eligible for it will be subject only to the conditions specified in Rules VI and VII. But see notes to this Rule.\n\n1.\u2020 Leave granted under these Rules, without Furlough pay, will not reckon as Furlough already taken in calculating the balance at an officer's credit, or as part of the total of eight years allowed, as shown in Rule XVI, but all Furlough with Furlough pay, whether on private affairs or on medical certificate, taken under these Rules, will so reckon.\n\n2.\u2020 Furlough and leave previously taken under the Rules of 1796 or 1854, will count, as respects officers who have elected these Rules, as follows:\n\nFurlough on private affairs, with pay, taken under the Rules of 1796 or 1854, counts in all respects as Furlough.\n\nLeave on sick certificate, under the Rules of 1796, does not count in any respect as Furlough.\n\nLeave on sick certificate, with pay, under the Rules of 1854, counts as part of the maximum of eight years allowed under these Rules, but until the maximum thus made up be reached, this leave will not count as Furlough already taken in determining the amount of Furlough to which an officer is entitled.\n\nLeave without pay under the Rules either of 1796 or 1854 does not count in any respects as Furlough.\n\nN.B.\u2014Furlough on medical certificate with \"Furlough pay\" obtained by officers, under Rule\n\n* As modified by Army Circulars, India, July, 1886, Clause 93.\n\u2020 As modified in G. G. O. No. 197 of 1st March, 1877.\nIX, Note (1) of these regulations, between the publication of G. G. Orders No. 171 of the 25th February, 1874, and No. 197 of the 1st March, 1877, will not be reckoned as \"Furlough already taken\" in computing the amount of Furlough at the credit of such officers; but it will form part of the aggregate of eight years allowed to officers.\n\nNote (1).\u2014An officer of less than eight years' service in India may obtain Furlough not exceeding two years, on medical certificate, with Furlough pay and retention of appointment, provided he has been three years in the Staff Corps, or\u2014in the case of a Royal Engineer Officer holding a permanent staff appointment, or an officer not in the Staff Corps\u2014has served for three years in India.\n\nNote (2).\u2014If the officer has not been three years in the Staff Corps, or served three years in India, as the case may be, he will receive \"English Furlough pay\" only, and must vacate his appointment, unless entitled to retain it under Rule II.\n\nNote (3).\u2014This Rule in Note (2) and the proviso in Note (1), however, are not applicable to officers of the Indian Army who entered the new Line Regiments, or Royal Artillery, and subsequently the Staff Corps.\n\nNote (4).\u2014Unemployed General Officers of the Staff Corps or local service can be granted Furlough without serving the intervals of three and six years, respectively, prescribed in Rules VIII and IX, and they can remain in Europe after they have exhausted the full period of Furlough allowed during an officer's service by certain Rules.\n\nRule XVI (eight years on the whole) on the English Furlough pay of their rank.\n\nNote (5).\u2014And a Major-General of the Staff Corps\u2014if he has so much Furlough at his credit, and proceeds to England within a year of his being promoted to that rank, or of ceasing to be employed\u2014can continue, after the expiration of the two years' Furlough, to receive half his Indian pay until he completes the period of three years, during which he would be entitled to draw his Staff Corps pay if he were in India.\n\n3. If an officer appointed to any duty in England draws his Indian Allowances, with or without any portion of his staff salary, he can count the period of such employment as service towards Furlough; but if he is appointed to an office in England to which a fixed consolidated salary is attached, he cannot reckon the time of such employment as service towards Furlough.\n\nX.\u2014An officer eligible for Furlough need not take the whole amount to which his service entitles him, but may apply for any portion thereof as an instalment; and in that case the balance will remain at his credit in any future computation of the amount of Furlough.\n\nIllustrations.\n\n1. An officer who has served nine years in India is entitled to two years' Furlough; he takes only one year, and after his return remains in India for five years.\n\n| Total service in India | ... | ... | ... | 14 years. |\n|-----------------------|-----|-----|-----|---------|\n| Furlough due on that service | ... | ... | ... | 3 \" |\n| Furlough already taken | ... | ... | ... | 1 year. |\n| Balance for which he is eligible | ... | ... | ... | 2 years. |\n\n2. An officer who has served twenty years in India without taking furlough is entitled to four years' furlough. He can only take, however, two years at one time carrying pay, the balance remaining at his credit in any future computation of furlough to which he may be entitled. He can take that balance after completing three years' service from the date of his return from the first instalment.\n\nNote.\u2014An officer is said to have furlough at his credit\u2014even though he may not be able to obtain it owing to the number of absentees or other causes,\u2014when the calculation of his service, as in illustration 1 above, shows a \"balance for which he is eligible.\"\n\n* XI.\u2014Furlough on Urgent Private Affairs for six months on pay equivalent to the British regimental pay of his rank, may be granted when the officer has less than six months' Furlough at his credit, or when from other causes, e.g., the number of absentees, or his not having served three years since his last return to duty, he is not able to take it. The said period may form part of the periods of either eight or six years referred to in Rule IX, and also\u2014except in the case of an officer in Civil employ, see Rule VIII (Note 1)\u2014of the three years which are required to intervene between two periods of Furlough by Rule VIII.\n\n\u2020 Furlough under this Article is not admissible to an officer in Civil employ who is eligible for the grant of Special Leave on Urgent Private Affairs under the Civil Leave Code.\n\n2. This leave cannot be given in extension of any Furlough, neither can it be extended beyond the six months unless on medical certificate; in which case the whole of the leave will be considered as if taken under Rule XIV, Clause 1.\n\nNote.\u2014Ill health is not considered as warranting Furlough under this Rule to any officer who\n\n* As modified in G. G. O. No. 197 of 1st March, 1877.\n\u2020 Army Circulars, India, 1882, Clause 93.\nunder the provisions of these Rules can obtain furlough on medical certificate without forfeiting his appointment.\n\nXII.\u2014Subject to State considerations, there will be no restriction as to the places to which an officer may resort during Furlough. But if he desires to spend in England the rest of a \"Furlough in India,\" or vice versa, he must obtain permission to do so from the Government of his Presidency, or from the Secretary of State for India, as the case may be; and on landing in either country, he must report his arrival accordingly to the Military Department of his own Presidency, or to the India Office, forwarding a copy of the permission granted him to change his destination. He must also communicate his address. An officer who on his return to India reports his debarkation without forwarding at once a copy of the permission granted him to change his destination, or submitting an application for such permission, will be considered to have returned to his duty.\n\nXIII.\u2014Furlough on medical certificate is obtainable as indicated in Notes (1 and 2) of Rule IX and in Rule XIV. Absence on such Furlough for a longer period than two years at one time will involve forfeiture of appointment. [But see exceptions in Rule II.] Furlough may, however, be extended on medical certificate up to a third year on \"English Furlough pay;\" and an officer on Furlough on private affairs who may be obliged to obtain an extension on medical certificate will be thenceforward entitled to the same advantages, and subjected to the same disadvantages as to retention of appointment, pay, &c., as if he had originally obtained Furlough on medical certificate.\n\n2. In the event of an officer not being able to return to his duty after an absence of three years, it will rest with the Secretary of State for India in Council to order him to appear before a Medical Board, with a view to placing him on the retired list, if entitled to pension, or on the half-pay list.\n\nIf he exceeds three years' absence on medical certificate the officer may have to retire or go on half pay.\n\nExtension on medical certificate over three years to be without pay.\n\nNote.\u2014All officers, however employed, and whatever the amount of leave granted them may be, who leave India on sick certificate, are required to produce a certificate of fitness for duty before they can be allowed to return.\n\n3. Should the circumstances of the case warrant a further extension of Furlough, it can only be granted without pay.\n\nOfficers on medical certificate must be pronounced fit for duty before returning to India.\n\nXIV.\u2014An officer whose health may necessitate his taking Furlough within three years from the date of last return from any Furlough except that taken for a period not exceeding six months under Rule XI (and excepting also in the case of an officer in Civil employ, ordinary Furlough not exceeding three months), may obtain under the usual medical certificate, such amount as may be duly certified to be necessary for the restoration of his health; but he will receive only \"English Furlough pay,\" and must vacate any appointment he may be holding, unless entitled to retain it under Rule II.\n\n2. If, however, he shall have served three years since the date of his last return to duty, although there may be no balance of Furlough at his credit, he will be entitled on obtaining Furlough on medical certificate to retain his appointment and to receive \"Furlough pay,\" as laid down in Rule V, for the entire period not exceeding two years. Should the latter period be exceeded, he will come under the provisions of Rule XIII.\n\nXV.\u2014An officer entitled to Furlough, or having a balance of Furlough at his credit, whose health may necessitate his absence from India, must take the leave as Furlough under Rule IX, but without forfeiting any passage money to which he may be entitled under Military Fund Rules,\u2014or if a subaltern by Regulation when proceeding on medical certificate.\n\n2. Should the officer be declared fit for duty before the expiration of two years, he may be granted extension on private affairs up to that limit, provided that he has so much at his credit, and that if he remains he will not be in excess of the established proportion of absentees. Any extension on private affairs of such Furlough beyond the said period of two years must be without pay.\n\n3. Any extension on Medical Certificate of Furlough under this Rule beyond two years must be on \"English Furlough pay\" under Rule XIII.\n\nXVI.\u2014The aggregate amount of Furlough with pay and retention of appointment on private affairs and on medical certificate that may be granted to an officer during his service will be limited to eight years.\n\nFurlough not reckoned in this period.\n\nNote 1.\u2014This aggregate is calculated agreeably to Clauses 1 and 2 of Rule IX.\n\nNote 2.\u2014Furlough allowed by proper authority to reckon as service for pension under the provisions of G. G. O.'s No. 1113 of 1857, and 95 of 1866, or in consequence of an officer's employment on any duty during his Furlough, will not reckon as part of the aggregate period of eight years.\n* XVII.\u2014If taken in India, Furlough is reckoned from the date of the absentee\u2019s quitting his station to that of his return thereto. If taken out of India, Furlough commences from the date on which the vessel on which the officer embarks quits her moorings or anchorage, whether she leaves the limits of the port or not, and terminates on the day immediately preceding that on which the vessel on which he returns to India drops her anchor or is moored at any Indian port. An officer\u2019s Furlough begins on the vessel\u2019s departure from any Indian port at which he first joins her, and ends on the day before her arrival at the port where he last quits her.\n\nNote 1.\u2014Furlough out of India taken before the 17th November, 1883, reckoned from the date of the sailing of the vessel on which any officer embarked, or (if from Calcutta) the date on which she left the Sandheads to the date of disembarkation, the latter being considered as a day of duty. (But see exception in Note 2.)\n\nNote 2.\u2014From the 14th April, 1879, to the 4th September, 1874, inclusive, the date of disembarkation was reckoned as a day of Furlough and not of duty.\n\nNote 3.\u2014The Furlough of an officer ordered to India before its expiration for special duty or on account of the exigencies of the service, terminates on the day previous to that of his embarkation for India from any port in England or the Continent of Europe. When the officer avails himself of the balance of his Furlough, it commences on the day of his first landing either in England or on the Continent of Europe.\n\nXVIII.\u2014Subsidiary Leave to embark for Europe or elsewhere on furlough will be granted for any period deemed necessary, not ordinarily exceeding thirty days. Leave up to the same limit, to enable him to rejoin on his return from furlough, will be granted from the date of his disembarkation in India. This applies equally to furloughs taken under Rule XI. The authority which has power to grant Subsidiary Leave can, on due cause being shown, grant any necessary extension of it., but this can be done only on very sufficient reasons.\n\nNote (1).\u2014The words \u201cwith the necessary Subsidiary Leave\u201d will be added to the G. G. O. granting an officer furlough, and will be understood to mean both the leave granted before embarkation for Europe, and on return.\n\nNote (2).\u2014An officer obtaining a furlough on private affairs or medical certificate must embark within three months of the date of the General Order which notifies it, or take up the first portion of his furlough in India until he embarks; if not, the General Order will cease to have effect. The only exception to this rule that can be allowed is when the officer is prevented from embarking within the three months owing to his detention in India by proper authority on bona fide public grounds. If, however, the officer does not, within a reasonable time, avail himself of the furlough given him, his subsequently being placed on duty rendering his detention necessary will not exempt him from the rule; and in every case of such detention the officer must at once report it, and he is not to embark after the expiration of three months until he has applied for and obtained from the Government of his Presidency an extension of the period.\n\nNote (3.)\u2014Officers who may be serving in other Presidencies than their own, if they desire to embark bona fide for Europe from the latter, may obtain Subsidiary Leave accordingly, and their furlough will reckon from the date of their embarkation at their own Presidencies.\n\nN.B.\u2014For full information as to the submission of applications for furlough, see Bengal Army Regulations, Sec. 13.\n\nNote (4.)\u2014The allowances of Military Officers in civil employ during Subsidiary Leave, and after return to India until they rejoin their appointments, will be adjusted according to Civil Rules.\n\nLeave preparatory to retirement.\n\nNote (6.)\u2014An officer unavoidably detained at the Presidency for passage in a troopship, beyond the usual Subsidiary Leave, shall count the period of such detention as Subsidiary Leave.\n\nPay issued monthly in India, quarterly in England.\n\nXX.\u2020\u2014Advances of furlough pay will continue to be made in India to those officers who desire it for three months from date of embarkation. Payments in continuation will be made in England on the expiration of six months from that date.\n\nXXI.\u2014The last pay certificate issued to each officer who may be granted furlough, whether on private affairs or on medical certificate, will specify the rate of the pay and staff salary of his last substantive appointment, and the rate to which he will be entitled in Europe in virtue of Rule V.\n\n---\n\n* Army Circulars, India, 1882, Clause 58.\n\u2020 For advances on return to duty see p. lxxii.\nXXII.*\u2014An officer acting in India for an absentee on furlough will be restricted, for the entire period that he may so act, to the half staff salary of the appointment in which he may be acting, in addition to the full pay of his rank, and the half staff salary of his own appointment, if he possess one. The aggregate staff salary granted to an acting officer in such cases will not be less than Rs. 100 per mensem, unless the full staff salary of the post in which he is officiating is less than that sum.\n\nPay of Warrant Officers acting for others on furlough.\n\n\u2020 Note.\u2014The indulgence granted by the above rule is only allowed to one directly officiating in the place of the officer absent on furlough, not to one acting in the room of an officer who is himself acting for an absentee on furlough.\n\nXXIII.\u2014The privilege heretofore granted to Military and Medical Officers who had elected the rules of 1854, of counting certain periods of leave as service for pension, is retained, and is applicable to those who elect these rules subject (in the case of officers under the rules of 1796) to the condition laid down in Sec. 4 of Rule XXXIV.\n\nPeriods of furlough, &c., counting as service towards pension.\u2021\n\nPeriods of furlough reckoned by Warrant Officers towards pension.\n\n| Periods | Service |\n|---------|---------|\n| 15 months in 12 years' Departmental Service. |\n| 20 \"    | 14 \"    |\n| 24 \"    | 16 \"    |\n\n3.

The balance within the limit of eight years' total furlough on private affairs and Medical Certificate laid down in Rule XVI, will represent the leave to which he will be entitled on the expiration of not less than three years from his last return to duty. (See Sections 1 and 2 of Rule IX.)\n\nIllustration.\n\n(1.)\u2014An officer, who had obtained under the existing rules two years' furlough after ten years' service, returns to India on the date on which this order is promulgated.

No. 585 of 1874.\n\u2021 As modified by Regulations of 1881. See p. lxxxiv.\nCHAPTER II.\n\nGeneral Leave on Private Affairs and Sick Certificate in India.\n\nXXV.\u2014An officer will be eligible, as at present, to take leave on private affairs or sick certificate anywhere in India for any period not exceeding six months, at the discretion of His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief or of the Government under which he may be serving. During the entire period of his absence on this account the officer will be entitled, as at present, to his full pay and a moiety of his staff salary. Leave taken under this rule will form no part of the eight years' aggregate furlough. If this indulgence should be taken advantage of for a third year consecutively, the officer will lose his staff appointment unless entitled to retain it under Rule II.\n\nXXVI.\u2014Leave on sick certificate for a period exceeding six months, capable of extension, under renewed medical certificate, to a limit of one year, may be granted to any officer who, in the opinion of a Medical Board, may require it. Leave of this nature, taken after the promulgation of these rules, will be held to constitute a part of the maximum period of eight years' leave of absence to which an officer is entitled in his entire period of service, but will not be regarded as furlough, nor will it affect the intervals entitling to furlough laid down in Rule IX. During this leave the absentee will draw a moiety of his staff salary in addition to the pay of his rank. But if the twelve months be exceeded, the whole leave must be reckoned as furlough, and allowances be adjusted accordingly.\n\nXXVII.\u2014Short leave, not exceeding three months, on private affairs or sick certificate, may also be taken to sea, on the above condition, but absence from India for any longer period will be treated as furlough.\n\nXXVIII.\u2014All general leave taken in India counts as part of the leave reckoning against service for pension.\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nPrivilege Leave.\n\nXXIX.\u2014Privilege Leave may be granted, as at present, for sixty days in each year to all officers in military employ, without deduction from the salaries and emoluments drawn by them. General Leave, in extension of Privilege Leave, can only be granted on the ground of sickness, or some other serious emergency which could not have been foreseen when the officer proceeded on sanction of the Commander-in-Chief or the Government.\n\nNOTE (1).\u2014Privilege Leave for ninety days, after thirty-three months' duty, which may be spent anywhere, in or out of India, is admissible to Commissioned and Warrant Officers under these rules; but to claim the privilege, it shall be necessary for an officer to show that he has had no Privilege Leave for thirty-three months previous to the date of his application, and that he has made satisfactory arrangements for the performance of his duties during his absence at no additional cost to the State. If leave for a shorter period than ninety days is taken, the balance is forfeited.\n\nNOTE (2).\u2014Officers are not required to report themselves to the India Office should they go to England, but it will be incumbent on them to keep their departmental superiors in India acquainted with their address.\n\nXXX.\u2014In the case of the stations noted in the margin, Privilege Leave may, as at present, be granted for ninety days to officers of local Corps, or of Corps which are usually employed in one or other of the districts named.\n\nAssam. Khairwara. Dera Ghazee Khan.\nShillong. Khotra. Rajampore.\nErinpoora. Bunnoo. Jacobabad.\nDeolee. Deva Ismael Khan.\n\nNOTE.\u2014The above rule is not applicable to officers of regiments moved in course of relief to any of the stations, or who are only temporarily employed there.\n\nXXXI.\u2014An officer is at liberty to proceed wherever he may desire on Privilege Leave, provided he can ensure his return before the expiration of his leave.\n\nXXXII.\u2014Privilege Leave cannot be taken in continuation of furlough, nor can furlough be obtained in continuation of Privilege Leave. If furlough be obtained by an officer while absent on Privilege Leave, the Privilege Leave will be converted into General Leave, the officer for that period sacrificing a moiety of his staff salary.\n\nMilitary Officers in Civil Employ.\n\nXXXIII.\u2014Those Military Officers (including Warrant Officers who hold Honorary, Veteran, or Unattached Commissions) in Civil or Political employ who may elect these Rules when they take leave in India, come, as respects periods of leave obtainable and amount of pay to be granted,\nunder the Civil Leave Rules. When they take leave out of India, they come under the Military Leave Rules. (See, however, Rule XI.)\n\nNote.\u2014Furlough in India is allowed under Chapter I of these rules to a Military officer in civil employ, under the same chapter, by the Government to which he is subordinate; as also Subsidiary, Privilege, and Examination Leave under the Rules in the Civil Leave Code; but under no circumstances will he be allowed any Leave out of India under the Civil Leave Code, but under Military Rules and by the Military Department.\n\nWhen furlough in India is required by a Military officer in civil employ, he must obtain from the Military Department, and submit to the Accountant General a \"furlough certificate\"; and when furlough is granted by the Government to which the officer is subordinate, a copy of the order granting the furlough should be sent to the Military Department.\n\n(2.) For Subsidiary Leave, see Note (5) of Rule XVIII.\n\nSubsidiary Rule.\n\nXXXIV.\u2014Officers of the Indian Military and Medical Services will be required generally to notify their intention to accept these rules or to adhere to those now existing, on the first occasion of their taking furlough or general leave after the publication of this order. Such election must be considered final, and under no plea whatever will an officer be subsequently relieved from the choice thus made.\n\nOfficers going home under these rules will pay English rates of subscription only to the Military Fund.\n\n3. Officers who may determine to abide by existing rules will be allowed to proceed on furlough on the conditions laid down in Rules VII, VIII, and XIII to the extent to which they may be entitled under the furlough regulations of 1841, or of 1796, whichever of the two they may have elected, and on the rates of pay contemplated in those Regulations, but retaining their appointments. The principle laid down in Rule XV must, however, be applied in those cases.\n\n4. If an officer under the furlough rules of 1796 elects the present rules, his service for pension will be reckoned under the former rules up to 1st July, 1868, and thenceforward under the rules of 1868; and the fact of the officer having been on furlough on 1st July, 1868, and not then having elected the rules of 1868, will not affect the case. All periods of leave out of Indian limits taken previous to 1st July, 1868, will be wholly excluded from his service for pension; but he may reckon towards pension periods of leave taken subsequent to that date, according to the length of his service counting for pension, as shown in Rule XXIII.\n\nRetirement under 1796 rules not affected.\n\n5. His election of these furlough rules in no way affects his right to retire under the pension rules of 1796.\n\nFURLOUGH AND LEAVE RULES OF 1875.\n\n(WITH SUBSEQUENT ALTERATIONS.)\n\nG.G.O. No. 1316, dated 30th December, 1875.\n\nI. Officers included in Schedule A may receive, after five years' service in India or under the Government of India, one year's furlough, and an additional year for each subsequent five years' service. Furlough not taken at the time it becomes due is not lost, and can, subject to these rules, be taken later.\n\nNote.\u2014Service for furlough under these rules, in the case of an officer electing them, is reckoned from the date of his election. (See also Notes 2 and 3 to Schedule A.)\n\nII. An officer may receive at any time any portion of the furlough to which he is entitled; but, except under Rule VIII, he may not be absent from duty on any ground for more than three years consecutively; nor, on return from furlough, may he receive, except under Rule VI, any further portion of the furlough to which he is entitled until after the interval of two years.\n\nIII. It must be distinctly understood that furlough is subject to the exigencies of the public service. Officers commanding regiments, and Heads of Departments, will forward no application for furlough unless able to satisfy the superior authorities that the officer's services can be spared without any inconvenience to the public service.\n\nIV. Furlough does not involve forfeiture of appointment, may be spent anywhere, and counts as service for pension. (See Rule VIII.)\n\nV. *A commissioned officer on furlough receives (up to, but not beyond, the sum of \u00a31,000 a year) half the emoluments of his office, computed according to a rate of exchange to be fixed in each year by the Secretary of State; but in any case he does not receive less than \u00a3250 a year. The emoluments of his office include all pay, staff corps pay, staff salary, and Indian allowances he would receive in respect to it if he were on duty, and for the purpose of each payment his office is the office he fills on the day when that payment becomes due.\n\n2. A Warrant Officer receives half the emoluments of his office, calculated in the same manner as those of Commissioned Officers, no Warrant Officer, however, receiving as furlough\n\n* As modified by G.G.O. No. 410 of 11th May, 1877.\npay less than the English furlough pay of his rank.\n\nVI. Upon certificate of a Medical Board, an officer not entitled to furlough, if he has served not less than two years in India, may receive it for any period not exceeding two years; but such furlough will be deducted from his next accruing furlough until it is paid off. An officer will not be allowed to anticipate furlough under this rule to an aggregate amount of more than two years.\n\n* Note.\u2014An officer of less than two years' service from date of coming under the new rules, falling sick, will be sent to England on medical certificate, on English furlough pay, without the period of his furlough being fixed, subject to the decision of her Majesty's Government as to his ultimate disposal; a special report on each case being submitted to her Majesty's Government by the Government of India, or in the case of officers of the Madras or Bombay Army by the Government of those Presidencies. (See Notes 2 and 3 to Schedule A.)\n\n\u2020 Furlough on medical certificate under this rule (except in the case of officers invalided home for sickness due to wounds, or other cause, solely attributable to active service in the field) does not count as service for pension until it has been paid off as provided for in the rule; when due solely to active service in the field it is allowed to reckon as service for pension without being paid off as provided for under ordinary circumstances in the rule; but it does not count as service for furlough: i.e., an officer obtaining it shall still be required to put in the full Indian service qualifying for furlough under the rules of 1875, with the condition also that he shall complete two years' further service in India before availing himself of it.\n\n\u2021 An officer serving under the Regulations of 1875, who has been allowed to count as service for pension any furlough taken under Rule VI, due to active service in the field, under the provisions of India Army Circulars, Clause 170 of 1888, and Clause 41 of 1882, may, should the circumstances of the case warrant the indulgence, be again permitted to anticipate furlough to an amount of not more than two years in all, under Rule VI. In all cases of the grant of furlough under the foregoing ruling a special report is to be made to the Secretary of State.\n\n\u00a7 All furlough due to wounds or illness solely attributable to active service in the field shall be treated as \"extraordinary furlough,\" reckoning as service for pension and not subject to repayment. The rules published in Clause 154, India Army Circulars of 1881, and Clause 112 of 1883, will govern the grant of the above concession, and the maximum amount of furlough to be treated as extraordinary furlough will be two years.\n\nVII. An officer who has exhausted the furlough obtainable under these rules, and who may be certified by a Medical Board to be still unfit for duty, will be placed temporarily or permanently on half pay, according to the circumstances of the case.\n\nVIII. Under very urgent circumstances, special furlough may be granted for private affairs, which need not be paid back; but it will be in all cases without any kind of pay, and will not count for pension.\n\nNote.\u2014The amount of leave which may be granted under this rule will be restricted to such period as the Government granting it is satisfied is actually necessary with reference to the urgency of the case.\n\nIX. Officers and Warrant Officers proceeding on furlough to Europe may, if they desire it, receive an advance equivalent to three months' furlough pay.\n\nX. Leave may be granted for any period not exceeding six months at a time, and may not, except for very urgent reasons, to be specially reported to the Government of India, be renewed till after six months have elapsed from its expiration. It must be spent at some place east of the 40th degree of east longitude. Subject to these conditions, it may be granted or refused entirely at the discretion of the local authorities, who in granting it shall fix its duration, and may fix the limits within which it shall be spent, and whether during its continuance half pay and allowances are to be deducted for the payment of a substitute; and they may grant it as preparatory to furlough, or for the purpose of a medical examination. Leave counts as service for pension and furlough. The local authorities shall be defined for the purpose of this rule by the Government of India.\n\nXI. Leave and furlough are reckoned from and to the close of the days named in the order granting them.\n\nNote.\u2014From and after the 17th November, 1883, the day on which the vessel on which an officer proceeds on furlough quits her moorings or anchorage, whether she leaves the limits of the port or not on that day, will be reckoned as the date of the commencement of his furlough, and as a day of the furlough; and the date on which the vessel on which he returns to India drops her anchor or is moored at any Indian port, will be reckoned as a day of duty. An officer's furlough begins on the vessel's departure from any Indian port at which he first joins her, and ends on the day before her arrival at the port at which he last quits her.\n\nXII. The position of the officers not included in Schedule A will be unchanged as respects leave or furlough.\n\nXIII. Officers now in the service placing themselves, from a given date, under these rules, shall count service for pension up to that date under the rules to which they were then subject.\n\nNote.\u2014An officer takes with him so much service for pension as he had become entitled to under former rules.\n\nWhen, however, officers joining the Staff Corps have joined with less than 20 years'\nservice under the rules of 1854 or 1868, before coming under these rules, they shall, after completing 20 years' service in all, be permitted to count as service for pension a proportion of any furlough or leave they may have taken under earlier rules, at the rate of two years' leave for 20 years' service, or one-tenth.\n\nThus, an officer who, before coming under the rules of 1875, had a service of 14 years and 99 days, of which two years 142 days were on leave under the rules of 1868, would count one year and 156 days' leave, and would have 13 years 113 days' total service for pension.\n\n**Schedule A.**\n\nOfficers entering the Staff Corps or Indian Medical Service, and Warrant Officers attaining that rank, after the 31st December, 1875; and\n\nAny other officers, Commissioned or Warrant, belonging to the Indian Army or Medical Service, or officers of the Staff Corps, who, after the 31st December, 1875, shall, before asking for leave or furlough, apply in writing to their local Governments to be placed definitely upon this Schedule; but their service for furlough under Rule I shall commence from the date of such entry or such application respectively.\n\n**Note 1.**\u2014The date of entry into the Staff Corps is that for choice of furlough rules, viz., the date on which the officer was originally appointed on probation. An officer, therefore, whose date of admission to the Staff Corps is not after the 31st December, 1875, will have the choice of rules, but an officer whose date of admission is after that date will have no option.\n\n**Note 2.**\u2014Officers compulsorily placed under these regulations on entering the Staff Corps, will be allowed to count their previous military service in India towards furlough, provided they shall have served five years in India, of which not less than half shall have been in the Staff Corps; but any leave out of India on private affairs taken by them during service so counted will be reckoned as furlough taken under Rule I, and any leave taken on Medical certificate will be reckoned as taken under Rule VI.\n\nShould, therefore, an officer, who took sick leave out of India whilst in the British service, again require leave on Medical certificate on his admission to the Staff Corps, and proceed under Rule VI, he will be granted, in the first instance, only so much furlough as will complete the period admissible under that rule. This furlough may be extended to two years on \"English Furlough Pay,\" but it will rest with Her Majesty's Government to determine whether any, and if so, what, extension shall be granted.\n\n**Note 3.**\u2014Warrant Officers promoted to that grade after the 31st December, 1875, and thus compulsorily brought under these rules, will be allowed to count their previous service for furlough under Rule VI; but furlough is not to be granted under this rule until a Warrant Officer has completed two years' service since his last return to duty from furlough as a Non-Commissioned Officer, otherwise he can only be granted leave under the note to Rule VI.\n\n**Note 4.**\u2014An officer electing these regulations and having furlough to his credit under previous rules, forfeits such furlough absolutely, he being required to serve five years from date of such election to entitle him to one years' furlough, unless it be sick furlough. An officer similarly circumstanced, but having furlough to his debit, is equally with the others entitled to take one year's furlough five years after electing the new rules.\n\nAny officers in civil employment declared by the Government of India to be under Civil Leave rules shall not be under these rules.\n\n**Note 5.** The last pay certificate issued to an officer to whom furlough or leave has been granted shall state the pay to which, under Rule V, he is at that date entitled in respect to the office he is holding, noticing the date, if any fixed, at which he will vacate it.\n\n**Subsidiary Rules.**\n\nWith advertence to the foregoing rules, the Right Honourable the Governor-General in Council is pleased to notify\u2014\n\nI. That no \"extra or special allowances\" drawn by an officer, which are now excluded from the account in calculating furlough pay under the rules of 1868, can be reckoned in calculating furlough pay under these rules (Rule V).\n\nII. That the Governments of the three Presidencies, or their Excellencies the Commanders-in-Chief, in regard to officers serving directly under them, shall be held to be the \"local authorities\" named in Rule X.\n\nIII. That, pending further orders, a Staff Officer granted leave under Rule X shall receive, as heretofore, the pay or Staff Corps pay of his rank, and half the staff salary of his appointment during such leave; but full staff salary may be allowed him for the first two months (as now during Privilege Leave) when he makes approved arrangements for the performance of his duties during that period. In such cases the G. O. granting the leave must state that the first two months are to be on full staff pay.\n\n\u2020(a). The leave up to sixty days in each year on full staff pay under the foregoing rule may be taken either for the full time or by instalments, in the same way as Privilege Leave under other furlough rules is taken, the condition that six months must elapse between the return of an officer to duty and the grant of a fresh period of leave not being enforced in respect of such leave of absence.\n\n**Note 1.**\u2014Privilege Leave for 90 days, after 33 months' duty, which may be spent anywhere in or out of India, is admissible to Commissioned and Warrant Officers under these rules; but to claim the privilege it shall be necessary for an\n\n* Rulings contained in G.G.O. No. 23 of 10th January, 1879.\n\u2020 Army Circulars, India, January, 1883.\nofficer to show that he has had no leave on full Indian pay and allowances for 33 months previous to the date of his application, and that he has made satisfactory arrangements for the performance of his duties during his absence, at no additional cost to the State. If leave for a shorter period than 90 days is taken, the balance is forfeited.\n\nNote 2.\u2014Officers are not required to report themselves to the India Office should they go to England; but it will be incumbent on them to keep their departmental superiors in India acquainted with their address.\n\nNote 3.\u2014No furlough or leave out of India, if exceeding six months, can be counted as part of the required 33 months' duty; but an officer who may have 33 months' service at credit before proceeding on such furlough or leave (in excess of six months) may be allowed to take accumulated Privilege Leave on his return, if he can be spared.\n\nNote 4.\u2014Warrant Officers proceeding out of India on Privilege Leave under Note 1 must deposit the amount of their return passage money, or give security for the payment of the same.\n\nNote 5.\u2014General Officers Commanding Divisions, Districts, and Brigades, are not eligible for the 90 days' Privilege Leave referred to in the above Note 1.\n\nNote 6.\u2014The \"Staff Officers\" referred to in the above Rule III apply to regimental as well as Departmental Staff.\n\nN.B.\u2014It is distinctly to be understood that the rule regarding the pay to be drawn on leave under Rule X is liable to be modified at any time in any way that the Government of India may deem expedient.\n\nIV. Pending further orders these rules are not applicable to any officer in civil employ.\n\n7th December, 1877.\n\nG.O. No. 1,102 of 1877.\u2014His Excellency the Governor-General in Council is pleased to notify the following supplementary regulations, which have received the approval of the Right Honourable the Secretary of State for India, providing for the case of Military Officers in civil employ, referred to in paragraph IV of the Subsidiary Rules appended to G.G.O. No. 1,316 of the 30th December, 1875:\n\nI. Any officer now in civil employ, who is subject to the Military Furlough Regulations of 1854 or 1868, shall remain so subject.\n\nII. Any Military Officer who may hereafter enter civil employ, who is not already subject to the Military Furlough and Leave Rules of 1875, shall remain subject to the Rules applicable to him when he enters civil employ.\n\nNote.\u2014An officer referred to in Rules I and II cannot elect the Military Furlough and Leave Rules of 1875, so long as he continues in civil employ.\n\nIII. Any officer who may enter civil employ, who is already subject to the Military Furlough and Leave Rules of 1875, shall be subject to the rules in the Civil Leave Code applicable to covenanted civil servants, both as regards furlough and leave taken out of India and in India.\n\nIV. If any officer, who is employed in the civil administration, has taken furlough in the Military Department under the said rules of 1875, this furlough shall be treated, in calculating the furlough or special leave admissible to him under the preceding rule, as if it had been furlough taken under the Civil Leave Code. Leave so taken under the 10th Military Rule shall be treated as if it had been Privilege Leave taken under the Civil Leave Code, and the claims of the officer under the Civil Leave Code adjusted accordingly.\n\nV. If an officer, who has been subject to the rules in the Civil Leave Code under the third of these rules, is again employed in the Military Department, and so again becomes subject to the Military Furlough and Leave Rules of 1875, any furlough or special leave taken by him under the Civil Leave Code will be treated in calculating the furlough admissible to him under the said Military Rules as if it had been furlough taken under the said Military Rules. Privilege Leave taken under the Civil Leave Code Rules will be treated as if it had been leave taken under the 10th Military Rule. Subsidiary or Examination Leave taken under the Civil Leave Code will not affect the claims of such an officer under the Military Furlough and Leave Rules.\n\nENGLISH FURLOUGH PAY.\n\n| Cavalry | Infantry |\n|---------|----------|\n| \u00a3 s. d. | \u00a3 s. d. |\n| 1 18 0 | 1 18 0 |\n| 1 12 6 | 1 12 6 |\n| 1 5 0 | 1 3 0 |\n| 1 12 8 | 1 5 0 |\n\nColonel's allowance when issued with Staff Corps pay out of India or English Furlough pay\u2014All branches...

The sum payable each month is approximately one-third of the quarterly sum, but in the intervening months only complete pounds are issued.\nADVANCES OF PAY.\n\nRules regarding advances of pay to Officers under the Furlough Rules of 1868 and 1875, and the Leave Rules for the Indian Staff Corps:\n\nOfficers proceeding on furlough to Europe may, if they desire it, receive an advance equivalent to three months' furlough pay. Officers returning from furlough or from temporary half-pay will similarly be granted advances of pay at the following rates, on obtaining permission to return:\n- For a Subaltern ... \u00a365\n- For all higher ranks ... 100\n\nNo advance, however, will be issued to an officer who obtains from the fund to which he is a subscriber a loan equal to or greater than the advance authorized for his rank, and an officer who obtains from his fund a loan less in amount than such advance will be granted only the difference between the two.\n\nRecovery of the advances made in England to be effected in India by five equal monthly instalments at the rate of exchange fixed for the year in which the advance was made.\n\nThe following advances on return to duty will be issued to Honorary Commissioned Officers, Senior Assistant Surgeons, and Warrant Officers, on the same conditions:\n- Hon. Comd. Officers and Senior Assistant Surgeons \u00a350\n- Conductors and 1st Class Asst. Surgeons ... ... 20\n- Sub-Conductors and 2nd Class Asst. Surgeons ... 15\n- 3rd Class Asst.

Such passages cannot be allotted until within a week of the date of the sailing of the vessel, nor can any application be registered unless the officer has already received official permission to proceed on, or return from furlough.\n\nINSTRUCTION OF OFFICERS.\n\nMemorandum relating to Classes of Instruction which Officers of the Indian Staff Corps are permitted to attend while on leave in England.\n\n1. An officer of the Indian Staff Corps who is desirous of joining a class of instruction while on leave in England must apply in writing to the Under Secretary of State for India, India Office, London, S.W. Applicants will be informed of their appointment to a class shortly before the date fixed for its assembling.

In posting an officer to a class, the War Office will, as far as possible, comply with his wishes as to station, subject to the available accommodation and numbers attending the class.\n3. The subjects of the courses of practical instruction are specified in the Queen's Regulations, Section IX, Sub-section V. These courses are intended to assist officers in preparing for examination in subjects (c) and (d) prescribed for Captains before promotion to Major (Queen's Regulations, Section IX, Sub-section III), which is the equivalent of Part II of the examination prescribed for Lieutenants and Captains of the Staff Corps in Article 331 of Indian Army Regulations, Vol. II. An officer on leave, who has not passed Part I, can only be admitted to a garrison course and to the examination in Part II on the understanding that he will pass Part I within six months of his return to his appointment in India; failing which he will be required to pass Part II again. An officer who passes in Military Law while in England is required to pass a supplementary examination in the Indian Articles of War and Indian Military Law on his return to India.\n\nThe examinations at Home Stations begin on the first Monday in May and November.\n\n4. The daily rates of lodging allowance, when quarters are not provided, are as follows:\n\n- For a field officer ... ... ... 8s.\n- \" captain ... ... ... 6s.\n- \" subaltern ... ... ... 4s.\n\nTo enable an officer to receive this allowance, he must send to the India Office, on completing the course, his certificate of qualification (which will be returned), and also a certificate signed by competent authority, showing that he was not provided with quarters, and stating the dates from and to which he was under instruction.\n\nAs there is no examination at the conclusion of the practical courses, the lodging allowance for attending these will only be admissible on passing the next examination in subjects (c) and (d) in the following May or November, as the case may be.\n\nNo travelling or other allowances are granted.\n\n5. Any application for permission to go through a course of instruction in gymnastics or fencing and single-stick practice at a military gymnasium, or to attend a riding-class or any class of instruction not specified in this memorandum, will be specially considered, but no lodging allowance will be granted in respect of any such course.\n\n6. On joining a class of instruction an officer must take his uniform with him.\n\n7. Officers of the Indian Staff Corps are not admitted to classes of musketry instruction at Hythe, nor to signalling courses at Aldershot.\n\n8. Special attention is directed to the following G.O.C.C., dated 15th January, 1887:\n\n\"As great inconvenience and unnecessary trouble has been caused by officers of the Indian Army on furlough in England withdrawing from classes of instruction which they have applied for permission to join, and to which, after correspondence between the India Office and the War Office, they have been duly appointed, it is notified that those who have received permission to join schools or classes of instruction in England will not, except under very special circumstances, be allowed to withdraw their names.\"\n\n(Signed) O. R. Newmarch, Major-General,\nMilitary Secretary,\nMilitary Department,\nIndia Office,\nFebruary, 1896.\n\nMODERN LANGUAGES.\n\n(Extract from Clause 82, Indian Army Circular, 1888.)\n\nStudy of Languages.\n\n1. The War Office regulations with regard to the examination of officers in foreign languages have been made applicable to the cases of Indian officers who are on leave in this country. Subject to any amendments that may be made from time to time, these regulations are as quoted hereunder:\n\n(Extract from Horse Guards General Order, No. 12, as amended by No. 131 of 1887.)\n\n\"I. In order to obtain an efficient record of the names of the officers who possess a knowledge of foreign languages, and encourage officers to study them, the following arrangements have been made:\n\nII. The Civil Service Commissioners will hold examinations in London twice a year, commencing on the first Tuesday in April, and the third Tuesday in October, for the purpose of examining officers in any language, European or Oriental, they may elect to take up. No officer, however, will be examined in more than three languages at the same examination.\n\nIII. Officers who obtain '5 of the total marks will be noted in their record of service as 'passed' in their language, and\n\n\"those who obtain '8 will be noted as qualified to be Interpreters.\n\nIV. The maximum marks allotted at this examination will be 800, divided as follows:\n\n- Dictation ... ... ... 50\n- Translation from the foreign language into English ... 100\n- Translation from English into the foreign language ... 200\n- Writing an essay or letter and copying manuscript ... 150\n- Oral examination\u2014Conversation, including reading manuscript at sight, and translation in writing from the foreign language into English, and from English into the foreign language, from extempore reading ... 300\n\n2. Applications of Indian officers for permission to attend the examinations mentioned in paragraph 1 should be made in writing to the Under Secretary of State, India Office, as early as possible beforehand.\n\n3. No pecuniary or other reward is granted by the India Office to an officer who qualifies at any\nof these examinations to be Interpreter in any language but Russian.\n\n4. For the encouragement of the study of Russian the following regulations have been made (in supersession of those promulgated in Clause 26, of Army Circulars, India, 1886), with effect from 1st April, 1888.\n\nParas. 5 to 17. Regulations for the study of Russian by Indian Officers (including Continuous Service Royal Engineer Officers) on Leave or Furlough from India.\n\n5. Any Indian officer who proves his possession of a sufficient elementary knowledge of Russian by scoring not less than 200 marks (25 of the total) at one of the half-yearly Russian examinations held by the Civil Service Commissioners, and who has in addition been the subject of a special recommendation (mentioned in paragraph 6) by the Government (of India, Madras, or Bombay) under which he is serving, may be permitted to proceed to Russia for a further course of study of the Russian language.\n\n6. In order to procure the necessary special recommendation to be permitted to proceed to Russia, he should take his own steps as early as possible beforehand, through the proper regimental or other channel. The receipt from India of such a recommendation is immediately notified by the India Office to the officer concerned.\n\n7. After passing the elementary test mentioned in paragraph 5, if he receives permission to proceed to Russia, he shall start from England within a fortnight from the date of the India Office letter conveying such permission.\n\n8. On starting for Russia he shall be granted an advance of pay of the same amount as his rank would entitle him to receive if he were returning to India from leave or furlough, and such advance shall be recovered by eight equal monthly instalments after his arrival in Russia.\n\n9. Shortly after his arrival in Russia he shall report to the India Office his address and the date of his entering Russia. Any subsequent change of his address shall likewise be reported.\n\n10. The period to be spent in Russia shall not be less than eight months. As special value is attached to a lengthened stay in Russia, he shall present himself for final examination one year after passing the elementary test, and shall not be permitted to attend any intermediate examination held by the Civil Service Commissioners.\n\n11. Two months before his final examination he shall notify to the India Office the address in England to which his order for examination should be sent by the Civil Service Commissioners.\n\n12. He shall return to England a full week before his final examination, and shall report to the India Office, in writing, his arrival and the date of his quitting Russia. If he quitted India on medical certificate, he shall apply for permission to appear before the Medical Board at the India Office.\n\n13. On the date mentioned in paragraph 1 he shall attend the Russian examination held by the Civil Service Commissioners.\n\n14. If he succeeds at the final examination in qualifying to be an Interpreter in the Russian language, he shall be paid by the India Office a gratuity of \u00a3200, and a further consolidated sum of \u00a332 or \u00a342 in repayment of his travelling expenses to and from St. Petersburg or Moscow, as the case may be. No grant on account of travelling expenses shall be made to an officer who fails to qualify to be an Interpreter; but he shall not become ineligible to earn the gratuity and the consolidated sum if he succeeds at any subsequent examination in qualifying to be an Interpreter.\n\n15. Whether successful or not at the final examination, he shall rejoin in India within two months from the date on which it began, unless granted leave or furlough beyond that period. No reversion to furlough involving absence from India for more than two months after the date of the examination, or for more than two years in all, shall (except on medical certificate) be allowed without the previously obtained assent of the Government under which he may be serving.\n\n16. If he is subject to the Leave Rules for the Staff Corps, he shall be entitled to count as Indian duty for promotion and pension the period spent in Russia, and to draw for such period the equivalent, at the official rate of exchange, of the Indian pay and allowances of his rank, and the half staff salary of his substantive appointment; provided that if the sterling amount be less than his leave pay under the Leave Rules for the Staff Corps, then leave pay shall be allowed. He shall be considered as on leave before arrival in Russia, and from the date of quitting Russia until he rejoins his appointment in India. The period spent in Russia shall not be considered as part of the two years' maximum absence from duty allowable under the Leave Rules for the Staff Corps.\n\n17. If he is subject to the Military Furlough Regulations of 1868 or 1875, or the Civil Service Regulations, he shall be entitled to count as Indian duty for promotion and pension, but not as service for furlough, the period from the date of the letter permitting him to go to Russia until his arrival in India within two months after his final examination. For any part of such period of duty not spent in Russia he shall draw the English pay of his rank, and for the part of it spent in Russia he shall draw, (a) if in military employment, the equivalent, at the official rate of exchange, of the Indian pay and allowances of his rank and the half staff salary of his substantive appointment, (b) if in civil employment, the equivalent, at the official rate of exchange, of \"two-thirds of his pay and allowances in India.\" (See Civil Service Regulations, Article 104.) He shall, however, have the option of counting the whole or a portion of such period as furlough, and of drawing furlough pay accordingly, so far as he is eligible for such furlough under the Furlough Regulations to which he is subject.\n\nParas. 18 to 32. Regulations for the study of Russian by Indian Officers who have completed the Staff College course.\n\n18. Any officer of the Indian Army leaving the Staff College on completion of the prescribed course, provided he has been reported as possessing a sufficient elementary knowledge of the Russian language, may (on application, in writing, to the Under Secretary of State, India Office), be permitted to proceed to Russia for a further course of study of that language.\n\n19. If he receives permission to proceed to\nRussia, he shall start from England not later than the second Tuesday in January.\n\n20. On starting for Russia he shall be granted an advance of pay of the same amount as his rank would entitle him to receive if he were returning to India from leave or furlough, and such advance shall be recovered by eight equal monthly instalments after his arrival in Russia.\n\n21. Shortly after his arrival in Russia he shall report to the India Office his address and the date of his entering Russia. Any subsequent change of his address shall likewise be reported.\n\n22. The period to be spent in Russia shall not be less than eight months.\n\n23. Two months before the final examination he shall notify to the India Office the address in England to which his order for examination should be sent by the Civil Service Commissioners.\n\n24. He shall return to England not later than the second Tuesday in October, and shall report to the India Office, in writing, his arrival and the date of his quitting Russia.\n\n25. On the third Tuesday in October he shall attend the half-yearly Russian examination held by the Civil Service Commissioners.\n\n26. If he succeeds at the final examination in qualifying to be an Interpreter in the Russian language, he shall be paid by the India Office a gratuity of \u00a3200, and a further consolidated sum of \u00a332 or \u00a342 in repayment of his travelling expenses to and from St. Petersburg or Moscow, as the case may be. No grant on account of travelling expenses shall be made to an officer who fails to qualify to be an Interpreter; but he shall not become ineligible to earn the gratuity and the consolidated sum if he succeeds at any subsequent examination in qualifying to be an Interpreter.\n\n27. Whether successful or not at the final examination, he shall rejoin in India within two months from the date on which it began.\n\n28. He shall not have the option of undergoing in England the \"course with other arms\" required by the Staff College regulations, but shall defer it till after his return to India.\n\n29. The whole period from the date of his quitting the Staff College to the date of his rejoining in India shall count as Indian duty for promotion and pension (but not as service for furlough, in the case of an officer under the Military Furlough Regulations of 1868 and 1875).\n\n30. For the period spent in Russia he shall be allowed the equivalent, at the official rate of exchange, of the Indian pay and allowances of his rank, and the half staff salary of his substantive appointment.\n\n31. For all other periods, from leaving the Staff College until arrival in India, he shall draw the English pay of his rank.\n\n32. Passage to India shall be provided after the examination, as if he had returned to India at the conclusion of the Staff College course.\n\n**Supplementary Rules.**\n\nNo officer on leave on medical certificate will be allowed to proceed to Russia on duty unless reported fit by the Medical Board of the India Office.\n\nNot more than 15 officers altogether of the Indian Army and Indian Medical Service will be allowed to proceed on duty to Russia in any official year, whether they have satisfied the test at the Staff College final examination, at the examinations held half-yearly in London by the Civil Service Commissioners, or at the half-yearly examinations in India.\n\nWith the exception of those officers who pass out of the Staff College, no officer will be regarded as having a claim to proceed to Russia on duty by reason of his having satisfied the test.\n\nIf more than 18 months have elapsed since an officer satisfied the test, he will be required to undergo a fresh examination before receiving permission to proceed to Russia.\n\nThe half-yearly examinations in India are held in January and July, and the names of the officers who are recommended by the Government of India for permission to proceed direct from India to Russia are furnished to the India Office as soon as the results of the examination are known. The names of the officers who are finally selected are communicated by the India Office to the Government of India, who give authority to each selected officer to take up his residence in Russia, to which country he should proceed about May or November, so as to be on the same footing as the officers of his batch who proceed from England.\n\nThe passport of an officer proceeding direct from India to Russia will be issued either by the Governor General of India or by the Governor of Madras or of Bombay. The necessary *wise* should be procured by the officer at Teheran, or any other place on the route where there is an accredited Russian agent.\n\nMilitary Department, India Office.\n\n1 November, 1890.\n\n---\n\n**CONDITIONS OF TRANSFER TO THE TEMPORARY HALF-PAY LIST.**\n\n*(Despatch to Government of India, No. 432, dated 22nd December, 1881, paras. 4\u20146.)*\n\nOfficers, placed on temporary half pay at the recommendation of the Medical Board of the India Office, shall be examined by the same Board as to their fitness to return to duty every two years, and if still reported unfit at the third examination, that is, after being six years on the temporary half-pay list, they shall be transferred to the retired list on permanent half pay. An officer reported to be unfit at the commencement of the second period, i.e., after two years on half pay, may, however, be permitted voluntarily to retire on permanent half pay.\n\nOfficers unable to appear before the Medical Board at the stated times will be required to furnish a certificate, signed by two medical men, as to their inability. An officer who is continuously unable to appear will be retired permanently after six years without further report.\n\nOfficers who, in view to being restored to the active list, may wish to appear before the Board at other times than those specified, may be permitted to do so. Officers ordered periodically to appear before the Board will receive their travelling expenses and lodging allowance on the Home scale, but those appearing at other times, at their own wish, must do so at their own expense.\nROYAL WARRANT FOR THE PROMOTION AND TRANSFER TO THE UNEMPLOYED SUPERNUMERARY LIST OF OFFICERS OF THE INDIAN ARMY.\n\nVICTORIA, R.I.,\n\nWhereas it has been represented to Us that it is expedient to amend the Regulations for governing the Promotion in the Army of the officers of Our Indian Forces, and their transfer to the Unemployed Supernumerary List, Our will and pleasure is, that, with effect from the 1st January, 1891, the following Regulations be established, and be the sole Regulations for these purposes, viz.:\u2014\n\n1. A Lieutenant-Colonel may attain the rank of Colonel\u2014\n   (a) By twelve years' service in the substantive grade of Lieutenant-Colonel in the \"local service.\"\n   (b) On being selected for the rank of Colonel under such regulations as Our Secretary of State for India in Council may lay down; provided he shall have completed three years' satisfactory service as a Lieutenant-Colonel.\n   (c) By brevet, on appointment to be one of Our Aides-de-Camp.\n   (d) By brevet, as a reward for distinguished service in the field.\n   (e) By brevet, for distinguished service of an exceptional nature other than in the field.\n\n2. If it shall be necessary to appoint an officer to a situation which may be declared by Our Secretary of State for India in Council to be one which shall carry the rank of Colonel, although the officer may not have the rank or service to qualify for promotion, the local and temporary rank of Colonel only shall, until he shall have completed the necessary qualifying service, be conferred on him while holding such appointment.\n\n3. The rank of Brigadier-General shall be local or temporary only.\n\n4. The names of General Officers shall be borne upon four separate lists. The first shall contain the names of those on the active list, and of those who, having been promoted out of their regular turn, shall be supernumerary; the second, the names of officers retired under Our Royal Warrant of the 31st December, 1877; the third, the names of officers placed on the unemployed supernumerary list under Our Royal Warrant of the 24th October, 1881; and the fourth the names of those who shall have retired from the service.\n\n5. There shall be no establishment of General Officers, and after the number of General Officers has been reduced, and the names of the Staff Corps Officers removed from the list of the Indian Army, as provided in Articles 6 and 7, there shall be no more than one General. Subject to this limitation, a Lieutenant-General of the Indian Army shall be promoted to the rank of General when the Lieutenant-General of the Staff Corps next below him in seniority as a Lieutenant-General is promoted to the rank of General in ordinary course, or, if there be already a General of the Indian Army, so soon thereafter as a casualty may occur. The maximum number (not to be exceeded except during a period of war) of Lieutenant-Generals shall be three, and that of Major-Generals shall be thirteen, and promotion to those grades shall be made under such regulations as Our Secretary of State for India in Council may lay down.\n\n6. The names of the Colonels and General Officers of the Staff Corps now borne on the Indian List to regulate promotion shall remain on that list (to be thereon retained in italics, until their death, retirement, or transfer to the unemployed supernumerary list, for the purpose of regulating the promotion of the officers below them), until the number of General Officers has been reduced as provided in Article 7. The names of the Generals and Lieutenant-Generals shall be removed when the number of Lieutenant-Generals has been reduced, and the names of the Major-Generals and Colonels when the number of Major-Generals has been reduced.\n\n7. After the 31st December, 1890, the number of General Officers on the active list shall be gradually reduced as follows:\u2014\n   (a) Officers who were on the establishment of General Officers on the 31st December, 1886, shall be promoted to vacancies in the rank of Lieutenant-General as casualties occur.\n   (b) As vacancies occur in the rank of Major-General, the second vacancy in every two shall be absorbed; and when there are no more officers qualified under (a) for promotion to the rank of Lieutenant-General, the third vacancy of every three in that rank shall also be absorbed. The remaining vacancies shall be filled until the number of Lieutenant-Generals of the Indian Army is reduced to three, and that of Major-Generals to thirteen.\n\n8. Subject to the above reduction, every vacancy in the rank of Major-General shall be filled by the promotion of the senior Colonel of the Indian Army; or by the moving up of the name of the senior officer of the Staff Corps borne on the list to regulate promotion; or by the absorption of a General Officer promoted for distinguished service. Every vacancy in the rank of Lieutenant-General, or in that of General, shall be filled up in like manner by the promotion of the Senior Officer of the Indian Army to the grade next below, or by the moving up of the name of the Senior Officer of the Staff Corps borne on the list of that grade.\n\n9. Temporary or local rank and command as Major-General, Lieutenant-General or General may, for the convenience of Our Service, be conferred on an officer of the next lower rank (whether he hold such rank permanently or temporarily), without regard to seniority.\n\n10. A Colonel who shall vacate an appointment as temporary Major-General, may upon the recommendation of Our Governor General in Council, be made an honorary Major-General.\n\n11. Promotion may be conferred upon a Colonel, Major-General, or Lieutenant-General, without regard to vacancies, for distinguished service in the field, or of an exceptional nature other than in the field, and in such case the recommendation of Our Governor General in Council, detailing the services for which the officer is promoted, shall be published in the General Orders of Our Indian Military Forces, and in the London Gazette.\n\n12. Field Marshals shall be appointed at the\nwill of the Sovereign, and the rank shall be conferred without reference to seniority. A General Officer, retired under Our Warrant of the 31st December, 1877, or placed on the unemployed supernumerary list under Our Warrant of the 24th October, 1881, shall remain eligible for promotion to the rank of Field Marshal.\n\n13. A Major-General or Lieutenant-General, on the unemployed supernumerary list, who was promoted to the former rank not later than the 31st December, 1886, shall be promoted to higher rank when the officer next junior to him on the effective list is so promoted.\n\n14. Until the number of General Officers has been reduced, as provided in Article 7, a Colonel, a Major-General, or a Lieutenant-General placed on the unemployed supernumerary list shall be promoted to higher rank when the officer on the establishment who was next junior to him as a Colonel shall obtain such promotion.\n\n15. A Major-General shall be placed on the unemployed supernumerary list on attaining the age of 62 years, and a Lieutenant-General or General on attaining the age of 67 years.\n\n16. Until the number of General Officers in each grade has been reduced, as provided in Article 7, a General Officer shall be placed on the unemployed supernumerary list after being unemployed for five years continuously since his promotion to Major-General, or after being unemployed for seven years continuously from the time of his last employment as Colonel.\n\n17. A Colonel of the \"local service,\" that is, an officer whose appointment was not made subject to the conditions prescribed in the General Order of Our Governor General of India in Council, dated the 9th December, 1859, No. 1637, shall be placed on the unemployed supernumerary list, provided he is in receipt of Colonel's allowance and not in military employ\u2014\n\nIf he attained the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel before the 1st October, 1877,\u2014at the age of 58 years.\n\nIf he attained the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel on or after the 1st October, 1877,\u2014at the age of 57 years.\n\nIf he attained the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel on or after the 1st October, 1877,\u2014at the age of 57 years.\n\nREGULATIONS FOR THE TRANSFER OF OFFICERS OF THE INDIAN STAFF CORPS TO THE UNEMPLOYED SUPERNUMERARY LIST.\n\n1. General Officers shall be placed on the Unemployed Supernumerary List on completing the ages and periods of non-employment fixed under Article 89 of the warrant of the 22nd February, 1890, for the compulsory retirement of the General Officers of the British Service.\n\n2. Colonels who entered the Staff Corps on or before the 12th September, 1866, shall be placed on the Unemployed Supernumerary List, provided they are in receipt of Colonel's allowance and not in military employ, and Colonels who entered the Staff Corps after that date, whether in receipt of the allowance and employed or not:\u2014\n\nIf they attained the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel before the 1st October, 1877\u2014at the age of 58 years.\n\nIf they attained the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel on or after the 1st October, 1877\u2014at the age of 57 years.\n\n3. Lieutenant-Colonels not selected for promotion to the rank of Colonel will be transferred to the Unemployed Supernumerary List after attaining the age of 55 years, under the same conditions as apply to Colonels.\n\n4. In special cases where it may appear desirable, the Secretary of State in Council may delay the transfer of an officer to, or in case of those under the Parliamentary guarantee, bring an officer back from the Unemployed Supernumerary List.\n\n5.

The commutation having been sanctioned, the applicant will be informed, and will have the option of withdrawing his application within 30 days after receiving notice.\n\n9. If the applicant shall not withdraw his application within that period, the decision will be considered final, and the commutation of pension will take place absolutely.\n\n10. In every case the capitalized sum will be payable in India, the sterling amount being converted at the official rate of exchange for the year in which the payment is made.\n\n11. In the case of an officer in Europe, the capitalized sum will be payable at the expiration of two months, and in the case of an officer in India, at the expiration of one month, from the date of the commutation being sanctioned. In each case the officer's pension will be issued in full up to the date of payment unless any delay has been caused by the officer's own fault or that of his agents.\n\n12. In any case in which a pensioner shall accept public employment, involving the withholding of pension, a deduction will be made from the salary payable to him equal to the amount which would have been abated from the pension if it had not been commuted, and in the event of his becoming entitled to a pension in respect of such employment, the amount of such pension granted to him shall not exceed the amount which he might have received had his pension not been so commuted.\n\n5th January, 1834.\nTHE INDIAN MILITARY SERVICE FAMILY PENSION REGULATIONS.\n\nThe following regulations are designed to secure suitable provision for the widows and orphans of officers of the Indian Staff Corps, officers of the Indian Medical Department, and Chaplains on the Indian Establishment not being subscribers to the late Military and Medical Funds; also officers and engineers of the Royal Indian Marine, and continuous service Royal Artillery and Royal Engineer officers who elect to subscribe.\n\nSuch pensions and compassionate allowances as are, by Royal Warrant, granted to the widows and families of British military officers, are already granted, from Indian revenues, to the widows and families of military officers in the service of the Government of India, who are excluded from the advantages of the late Military and Medical Funds; and it is to be clearly understood that the Government of India does not intend by these present supplementary regulations to sanction any further expenditure for this object from the Indian revenues. On the other hand, the Government of India does not, of course, wish that the Indian revenues should in any way profit by these regulations.\n\nThe Secretary of State for India in Council has reserved to himself the absolute right to regulate from time to time the contributions to be required from officers, in accordance with these principles, under these regulations, and to make any alterations in the regulations themselves that may appear to him equitable: provided always, that the scale of pensions fixed thereby shall not be reduced in the case of actual incumbents. The Secretary of State in Council will endeavour to adjust the contributions to be levied from officers exactly, so that they shall neither be too large nor too small to supply the pensions provided for by these regulations. But if it should appear on experience that they have been fixed too low, the Government will not require any supplementary retrospective payments; and if they are found to have been fixed too high, no claim to refund will be admitted.\n\nNo insurance fund is established by these regulations. The contributions will be credited and the pensions charged directly to the Indian revenues as military receipts and charges. But in order to adjust the rates of contribution from time to time to what is necessary to supply the pensions provided for by these regulations and no more, a separate pro forma account will be kept of all contributions levied and all payments made under these regulations, and of the interest which would have been allowed upon such contributions if a mutual insurance fund had actually been established.\n\nIn accordance with the principle announced in this notification, that the Government does not intend that the pensions provided by these regulations shall be any charge to the Indian revenues, the rates of interest and of exchange with England, to be allowed in this pro forma account, will be the rates which may be fixed from time to time by the Secretary of State in Council upon a consideration of the market rates of the day.\n\nAll needful statistics of ages, births, deaths, and marriages will be carefully registered, and these statistics, with the pro forma accounts, will be submitted at such periods as may be determined by the Secretary of State in Council to such actuary or actuaries as he may select, with instructions to investigate and ascertain whether the rates of contribution are such as will, at the rate of interest and exchange then to be reconsidered and refixed, supply the pensions payable under these regulations and no more. The expense of such actuarial inquiries and reports shall be debited in the pro forma accounts reported upon.\n\nUpon the report of the actuary or actuaries, the Secretary of State in Council will order any necessary alterations in the rates of contribution.\n\nThe report of the actuary or actuaries, with the orders of the Secretary of State in Council thereupon, shall be published in the Gazette of India, and any alteration ordered in the rates of contribution will take effect from the beginning of the month following the date of such publication. No retrospective adjustments will be made.\n\nREGULATIONS FOR THE PROVISION OF PENSIONS FOR THE WIDOWS AND ORPHANS OF MILITARY, MEDICAL, MARINE, AND ECCLESIASTICAL OFFICERS IN THE SERVICE OF THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA.\n\n1. Pensions will be provided under these regulations for the widows and orphans of the following officers on the Indian Establishment not being entitled to the benefits of any of the late Military and Medical Funds:\n\n- Officers of the Staff Corps.\n- Officers of the Indian Medical Department, including natives who avail themselves of the option given to them of becoming subscribers.\n- Chaplains, including probationary Chaplains.*\n\n2. Any officer who has entered the service before the 1st January, 1873, may provide pensions for his family under these regulations or not at his option. (See Appendix, Form A.)\u2020\n\n3. Every officer who enters the service on and after the 1st January, 1873, must, as a condition of his appointment, provide pensions for his family under these regulations.\n\n4. Any officer with whom by Regulation 2 it is optional to provide pensions for his family under these regulations, but who does not before the 1st of July, 1873, intimate his intention to make such provision, will thereafter be allowed to do so only on production of a medical certificate of sound bodily health. An officer who does not before the 1st of July, 1874, announce his intention to provide pensions for his family under these regulations will not be allowed to\n\n* A probationary Chaplain is required to subscribe, but in the event of his not being appointed a junior Chaplain on completion of probation he will be granted a refund, if married, under the provisions of Art. XXVI, and if unmarried of the amount of his contributions without interest.\n\n\u2020 Officers who elect to become subscribers must pay their subscriptions and donations from the date of the establishment of the fund with interest.\ndo so save under the special order of the Governor-General in Council.\n\n5. For the purposes of these regulations officers are classed as follows (for Marine officers see 5b):\n\nClass I.\u2014Lieutenant-Colonels in receipt of Colonels' allowances, and Surgeon-Major-Generals.\n\nClass II.\u2014Lieutenant-Colonels, Archdeacons, Surgeon-Colonels, Brigade-Surgeon-Lieutenant-Colonels, and Surgeon-Lieutenant-Colonels.\n\nClass III.\u2014Majors, Senior Chaplains, and Surgeon-Majors.\n\nClass IV.\u2014Captains, Junior Chaplains, and Surgeon-Captains who have served the Government of India for more than six years.\n\nClass V.\u2014Lieutenants, Surgeon-Captains who have served the Government of India for less than six years, and Surgeon-Lieutenants.\n\n5a. Royal Artillery and Royal Engineer officers who have been selected or who have elected for continuous service in India have the option of subscribing under these regulations, in accordance with the conditions laid down in Arts. 1483 to 1495, Army Regulations, India, Vol. I, Part I.\n\n5b. Officers and engineers who entered the Royal Indian Marine prior to the 1st January, 1893, were allowed the option of subscribing under these regulations from that date. Those who elected to do so will not be permitted to discontinue their subscription so long as they remain in the service, neither will those who declined to subscribe be allowed at any future time to become subscribers.\n\nFor the present the reduced rates of subscription laid down in Tables VI and VII are payable. Donations must, however, be paid at the full rates, and unmarried subscribers who have been in the service for a number of years may on marriage be required to pay a small additional donation.\n\nOfficers and engineers admitted to the Royal Indian Marine subsequently to the 1st January, 1893, must subscribe under these regulations as a condition of their appointment to the service.\n\nClassification.\n\nClass III.\u2014First Grade Commanders.\n\nClass IV.\u2014Second and Third Grade Commanders and Chief Engineers.\n\nClass V.\u2014Lieutenants, Engineers, Sub-Lieutenants, and Assistant Engineers.\n\nAny officer holding a first class port appointment, or the appointment of Deputy Director of the Royal Indian Marine, may at his option subscribe in the next higher class to that in which he is placed according to his grade as Commander.\n\nAn officer who has elected to subscribe in a superior class will not subsequently be allowed to revert to a lower class.\n\n6. The pensions provided under these Regulations are payable monthly in India, and quarterly in England, and to date of death.\n\n7. The amounts of the pensions provided are as follows, in addition to any pensions or compassionate allowances granted under Royal Warrant.\n\n### Table I.\u2014Pension to a Widow during Widowhood according to the Class of Her Husband at the time of his death.\n\n| Class of Husband at Death | I. | II. | III. | IV. | V. |\n|---------------------------|----|-----|------|-----|----|\n| Amount of pension to widow per annum | \u00a3160 | \u00a3130 | \u00a3100 | \u00a370 | \u00a340 |\n\n### Table II.\u2014Pensions to the Orphan Children of all Classes alike.\n\n| From birth till age of 6 years. | From age of 6 till age of 12 years. | From age of 12 till age of 21 years. | To females only from age of 21 years for life, or till marriage. |\n|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Amount of pension to each orphan per ann. | \u00a310 | \u00a320 | \u00a330 | \u00a345 |\n\nNote.\u2014Annuitants residing in India may either receive their pensions in Indian currency at the official rate of exchange, or in England in sterling, but having once exercised the option any subsequent change can only be permitted at the commencement of the official year.\n\n8. The pension of a minor orphan will be paid to his or her mother or other duly appointed or recognized guardian.\n\nContributions.\n\n9. The contributions for pensions under these Regulations, and the pensions of widows, will be regulated by the class of the contributing officer. An officer cannot secure a higher pension for his widow by contributing as if he belonged to a higher class.\n\nAs an exception to this rule, an officer at the time of completing five years' service as a substantive Lieutenant-Colonel or Surgeon-Lieutenant-Colonel has the option of subscribing in Class I; also at any subsequent period during active service, on the production of a certificate of health signed by two qualified medical practitioners.\n\n10. Contributions will be deducted by paymasters or other disbursing officers from the pay abstracts of officers contributing.\n10a. The circumstance that an officer is not in receipt of pay does not relieve him from the necessity of paying his contributions.\n\n11. Donations may be paid in one sum, or in 12 equal monthly instalments. If a donation be paid in instalments, interest on the unpaid portion will be levied at the rate of 4\u00bd per cent. per annum. The balance of any contribution due at an officer's death will be recovered rateably, without interest, from the pensions of his widow and orphans, in twelve monthly instalments in India, or four quarterly instalments in England.\n\n11a. Contributions which become due from subscribers when in Europe must be paid in England in sterling. If a subscriber, previous to quitting India, has commenced the payment of any donation by instalments, he may either complete the payment of the donation in India before leaving or pay the remaining instalments in England at English rates; but an officer on half-pay who continues to subscribe at Indian rates has the option of paying in India.\n\n12.

But an officer on furlough in India and not in receipt of full Indian pay will be required to pay only half the Indian rate of contribution.\n\nOfficers deputed to Europe under Article 102 and 103 of the Civil Service Regulations are required to pay the Indian rate of contribution.\n\nTABLE VII.\u2014Additional Monthly Contribution, payable by all Classes alike for each Child living on the first day of the month.\n\n| Fixed Sterling Rates | Reduced temporarily 16\u00bd per cent. |\n|----------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| s. d.                | s. d.                             |\n| For a son, until age of 21 | 1 11 | 1 7 |\n| For a daughter, until marriage | 4 10 | 4 0 |\n\nNote.\u2014The contributions and donations to be paid by Native Members of the Covenanted Medical Service are fixed for the present at an increase of 5 per cent. on the rates paid by Europeans.\n\nArrears.\n\n13. Interest at the rate of 4\u00bd per cent. per annum will be charged on arrears. Donations will become due from the date on which the liability is incurred, viz., on marriage, on promotion,\u2020 or on the birth of a child; but interest will not be charged on sums paid within one month from the date on which they become due.\n\nReports of Marriages, Births, and Deaths.\n\n14. An officer who is married at the date of his admission into the service must report the fact of his marriage at the time, and the names and dates of birth of his children, if any have been born to him. A member in the service must report his marriage, or the birth of a child born in wedlock, or the death of a wife or child, within one month of the occurrence to the Comptroller of Military Accounts in the Presidency.\u2021 Forms for this purpose are given in the Appendix.\n\n15. The birth of every child born alive must be reported; but if a child die before it is 30 days old, no payment in respect to it will be required.\n\n15A. If the report of a marriage, or of the birth of a child, be not made within one month of the occurrence, the donation payable in each case will be increased 2\u00bd per cent., and interest thereon charged from the date of marriage, or birth of the child. After six months' delay, donations will be increased 5 per cent., and interest charged as above.\n\n15B. In the event of the report of a marriage, or the birth of a child, not being made by a subscriber during his lifetime, in accordance with the rules, the widow or child will not be entitled to any benefits.\n\nPosthumous Child.\n\n16. A pension will be granted to a posthumous child on payment of the donation prescribed in Table V, which may be recovered by twelve monthly instalments in India or four quarterly instalments in England. The report of the birth of a posthumous child must be made in Form D, the last sentence being omitted.\n\nCommutation of Contributions.\n\n17. Officers may at the date of retirement, or\n\n\u2020 Except when promotion is uncertain. In such cases the date on which the liability is incurred will be the date of the \"Gazette of India\" in which the promotion is notified, or, when a continuous service Royal Artillery or Royal Engineer officer is in England, the date of the \"London Gazette.\"\n\n\u2021 Or the Director of Funds, India Office, when an officer is in Europe.\nat any subsequent period, commute their monthly contribution by a single payment representing the value thereof during the joint lives of husband and wife, and father and child.\n\nIn the event of the wife dying after the date of commutation, contribution at the unmarried rate must be resumed, or, as an alternative, it may be commuted.\n\nA subscriber who has commuted will on re-marrying become liable for marriage donation and the difference between the married and unmarried rates of contribution, or the commuted value on the joint lives.\n\n18. Widowers and bachelors may in like manner commute their monthly contribution for life. On each subsequent marriage they will become liable for the donation and difference of contribution laid down in the previous article.\n\nDonation and contribution or its commuted value must be paid for all children born to a subscriber after his retirement from the service.\n\nDuration of Pensions.\n\n19. If a widow re-marry her pension will cease during coverture, but if she again become a widow she will be entitled to revert to her pension as widow of her first husband, or, if her last husband have been a contributor, to receive a pension at her option as the widow of her last husband. A widow can only receive one pension.\n\n20. The pension of a male orphan is payable until he attains the age of 21 years.\n\n20a. Subscribers can make special provision for pension to sons who may become permanently incapacitated from earning a livelihood.\n\nThe pensions so provided for will commence at the age of 21, if the son be then fatherless, or, after that age, on his becoming fatherless, and as regards the amounts of such pensions, and the subscriptions to be paid to secure them, each case will be considered and determined on its merits.\n\n21. The mother or guardian of a male orphan who has completed the age of 16 may, at any time thereafter (on application in Forms F to H annexed to these regulations), have the residue of his pension commuted into a single payment, for the due application of which the mother or guardian will be held responsible. The following table gives the commuted value of such pensions:\n\n| Years | 16 | 17 | 18 | 19 | 20 |\n|-------|----|----|----|----|----|\n| Months | \u00a3   | \u00a3   | \u00a3   | \u00a3   | \u00a3   |\n| 0     | 129 | 106 | 81  | 56  | 28  |\n| 3     | 123 | 100 | 75  | 49  | 21  |\n| 6     | 117 | 94  | 68  | 42  | 14  |\n| 9     | 111 | 87  | 62  | 35  | 7   |\n\n22. The pension of a female orphan continues until her marriage, and then ceases absolutely. It does not revive on widowhood.\n\nGood Conduct.\n\n23. The pensions provided under these regulations shall, in all cases, be held during good behaviour only, and will be withheld if any pensioner is found to be leading an immoral life, or on proof of any gross misconduct. The order of the Secretary of State for India in Council in any such case shall be final and conclusive.\n\nAlienation of Pension.\n\n24. A pension paid under these regulations may not be transferred or assigned, or in any way alienated, from the pensioner to whom or for whose benefit it is payable.\n\nPassage Money.\n\n25. An officer may, by a special contribution, provide passage money from India for his widow and orphans. The amount so secured will belong to the officer's estate, but will be primarily applicable to the provision of passage money and outfit for any member or members of his family (wife and children) who may be in India at the time of his death. If the whole amount is not required for the above purpose, the balance will be paid over to the officer's estate. The amount secured must not exceed 1,500 rupees, and a health certificate must in every case be furnished by the subscriber. The value will be determined by the tables in Major-General Hannington's report.\n\n25a. The special contribution can be paid by monthly instalments not exceeding 24, the instalments in arrears bearing interest at 4\u00bd per cent. per annum, and in the event of a subscriber dying before completion of the payment, the balance due at the date of his death will be deducted from the sum insured.\n\n25b. Native commissioned medical officers are required to pay, as in the case of their ordinary contributions, 5 per cent. over and above the ordinary rates of special contribution.\n\n25c. In the event of a subscriber's family not having occasion to make use of the passage money for which special contribution has been made, it will be paid to his estate on his death, irrespective of whether this occurs before or after his retirement, or whether he continued to subscribe to the pension branch up to the date of his death.\n\nIf an officer on retirement desires to sever his connection with the insurance branch, he will be allowed the option of receiving the value of the sum assured at the date of withdrawal from the pension branch.\n\nIf, however, the option be then declined, the sum originally assured will be paid in accordance with the rules at the decease of the subscriber.\n\nTransfer to Her Majesty's Corps and Officers who resign.\n\n26. Officers who may be transferred from the Indian Staff Corps to Her Majesty's Line regiments, and officers who resign the service, will be entitled to receive back such portion of their contributions as may be in excess of the risk borne during their membership, but they cannot continue subscribers.\nHalf-pay.\n\n27. A married officer on half-pay must continue to subscribe at Indian rates* for full benefits, or at half the rates appertaining to his class for half benefits in respect to his wife's contingent pension, but full rates for children must be continued for full benefits. In the event of his return to full pay he will revert to full rates and benefits. Unmarried officers must continue to subscribe at the Europe rate of subscription.\n\nRetired Officers.\n\n28. Married officers who retire from the service on a pension may continue to subscribe at the Europe rate of subscription, or they may withdraw, receiving back such portion of their contributions as is in excess of the risk borne during the term of their membership; but the usual subscription will be deducted from the pension of all such officers until they shall have intimated in writing their intention of withdrawing. Unmarried officers may continue their subscription on the same terms as married officers, but will not be entitled on retirement to any refund in the event of their withdrawal.\n\nDismissed Officers.\n\n29. An officer who is dismissed the service by sentence of a court-martial, or by other competent authority, will cease, ipso facto, to be a contributor under these regulations, and will have no claim to any refund. His family will not be entitled to any pensions under these regulations.\n\nCertificates.\n\n30. Declarations as to continued widowhood and the survival of children must be furnished to the Accountant-General, India Office, by whom pensions in Europe are paid under the authority of the Director of Funds.\n\nAPPENDIX.\n\nNote.\u2014In England all reports and applications for pensions must be made to the Director of Funds, India Office, Whitehall, London, S.W.\n\nForm (A) of a Letter from an Officer with whom it is optional under Regulation 2 to contribute under these regulations, announcing his intention to do so.\n\nTo the Controller of Military Accounts for the Presidency of\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honour to announce my intention of contributing for pensions for my family under the regulations published with the Notification by the Government of India, in the Military Department, No. 1315, dated 28th December, 1872.\n\nI agree to be bound in every respect by the said regulations, and by any orders in modification thereof that may be hereafter passed by the Secretary of State for India in Council.\n\nI was born on the\n\nMy wife was born on the\n\nWe were married on the\n\nA certified copy of the register of our marriage is herewith transmitted.\n\nThe names and birthdays of my children are as follows:\u2014\n\nForm (B) of a Letter from an Officer, reporting his having joined the service of the Government of India, married.

D.\n\n---\n\n**MILITARY (LATE LORD CLIVE'S) FUND.**\n\n**Widows' Pensions.**\n\n1. The widows of officers who were originally in the old Indian service are alone eligible for this pension.\n\n2. They will be required to make a statutory declaration as to the amount of real and personal property possessed by their late husbands and by themselves; and no widow will be eligible for the full pension if the total of such property amounts to the following sums:\n\n3. The rates of pensions are as follows:\n\n| Ranks | Per diem. | Per annum. |\n|-------|-----------|------------|\n| Colonel, Surgeon-Major-General, and Surgeon-Colonel | s. d. | \u00a3 s. d. |\n| Lieut.-Colonel, Brigade-Surgeon-Lieut.-Colonel, and Surgeon-Lieut.-Colonel | 6 3 | 114 1 3 |\n| Major, Surgeon-Major, and Chaplain of 15 years' service | 5 0 | 91 5 0 |\n| Captain, Surgeon, Chaplain of 7 years' service, and Veterinary Surgeon of 20 years' service | 3 9 | 68 8 9 |\n| Chaplain under 7 years' service | 2 6 | 45 12 6 |\n| Lieut. and Veterinary Surgeon | 1 9 | 31 18 9 |\n\nPensions at diminished rates (the amount of which will be decided by the Secretary of State in Council) will, however, be granted in certain cases in which the property possessed exceeds the above limits. A diminished pension cannot be granted of a lower amount than \u00a310. This modification of the old rule has effect from 18th February, 1890.\n\n4. The pension of a widow may be withheld or discontinued should her conduct be such as to render her, in the opinion of the Secretary of State, unworthy of it.\n\n5. The pension is liable to be discontinued or reduced if at any time after the officer's death his widow receives any accession of property or income.\n\n6. Pensions lapse on re-marriage and are not restored on a second widowhood.\n\n7. Pensioners neglecting to claim the pension for three half-years will be considered as dead;\nand no arrears for a longer period than two years back from the date of application for admission or re-admission, as the case may be, will be allowed either to claimants or to pensioners after admission.\n\n8. The widows of officers formerly of the Indian service, who have joined the British army, are permitted to make their choice between these pensions and Royal Warrant pensions.\n\n9. The widows of officers who have retired from the service are not eligible for the benefit of these pensions.*\n\n10. The widows of officers who at the time of their death were pensioners on the Military (late Lord Clive's) Fund, are entitled to the benefits of the Fund provided they were married to their husbands prior to the latter becoming pensioners on the Fund.\n\nII. The pensions are payable quarterly, on the 1st January, 1st April, 1st July, and 1st October.\n\n12. In the event of any question arising concerning the qualifications of widows claiming these pensions, the decision rests with the Secretary of State in Council.\n\n13.

The physical fitness of each candidate will be determined previous to examination, by a Board of Medical Officers, who are required to certify that his vision is sufficiently good to enable him to perform any surgical operation without the aid of glasses. A moderate degree of myopia\u2020 will not be considered a disqualification, provided it does not necessitate the use of glasses during the performance of operations, and that no organic disease of the eyes exists.\n\nEvery candidate must also be free from all other organic disease, and from constitutional weakness, or other disability likely to unfit him for military service in India.\n\n6.

During the period of residence at the Army Medical School each candidate will receive an allowance of 8s. per diem, with quarters, or when quarters are not provided, with the usual fuel and light allowances of a subaltern, to cover all costs of maintenance; and he will be required to provide himself with uniform (viz., the regulation undress uniform of a Surgeon-Lieutenant of the British Service, but without the sword).\n\n11. All candidates will be required to conform to such rules of discipline as the Senate may from time to time enact.\n\n12. At the conclusion of the course, candidates will be required to pass an Examination on the subjects taught in the School. The Examination will be conducted by the Professors of the School.\n\nThe Director-General, or any Medical Officer deputed by him, may be present and take part in the Examination. If the candidate gives satisfactory evidence of being qualified for the practical duties of an Army Medical Officer he will be eligible for a commission as Surgeon-Lieutenant.\n\n13. The position of the candidates on the list of Surgeon-Lieutenants will be determined by the combined results of the preliminary and of the final Examinations, and, so far as the requirements of the Service will permit, they will have the choice of Presidency in India, according to their position in that list.\n\n14.

On first appointment they only come into receipt of \"Indian pay and allowances\" Despatch to Government of India, No. 265, of 26th Sept., 1878.\n\n19. Officers holding the principal administrative appointments and substantive military charges of the Indian Medical Service receive at present the following consolidated salaries:\n\n| Rank                                      | Rs. per mensem |\n|-------------------------------------------|----------------|\n| Surgeon-Major-General                     | 2,700          |\n| Surgeon-Colonel                           | 2,500          |\n| Surgeon-Colonel                           | 2,200          |\n| Surgeon-Colonel                           | 1,800          |\n| Brigade-Surgeon-Lieutenant-Colonel or Surgeon-Lieutenant-Colonel of 20 years' service and upwards in substantive charge* of a Native regiment | 2,250          |\n|                                           | 1,000 with Rs. 90, horse allowance in Cavalry regiments. |\n\n---\n\n* Medical charges are of two kinds\u2014substantive and officiating. The first is held by an officer as his fixed and permanent appointment. For this he is entitled to the monthly consolidated pay laid down in the above scale (para. 19), subject to the condition specified in para. 23.\n\nAn officiating charge is held by an officer who is acting temporarily in an appointment during the absence of the Officer whose substantive charge it is. The officer thus officiating receives not the consolidated pay of the appointment laid down in the scale (para. 19), but the Indian pay and allowances (para. 17) of his own grade plus half the staff pay of the appointment in which he is officiating (plus half the staff pay of his own appointment, if he have one).\n\nThe staff pay of an appointment is the difference between the Indian pay and allowances and the consolidated pay of the permanent incumbent. It has been ruled, however, that the extra allowance for an officiating charge shall never be less than Rs. 100 per mensem.\n\nExample 1. A Surgeon-Captain or Surgeon-Lieutenant of less than 5 years' service officiates for one of the same period of service in charge of a regiment. He receives Rs. 286. 10 + Rs. 100 = Rs. 386. 10.\n\nExample 2. A Surgeon-Captain or Surgeon-Lieutenant of less than 5 years' service, officiating for a Surgeon-Captain of 6 years' service, in charge of a regiment, receives Rs. 286. 10 + Rs. 600 = Rs. 390. 7. 5.\n\nExample 3. A Surgeon-Captain of 5 years' service holding permanent medical charge of a regiment, and officiating for a Surgeon-Major under 20 years' service absent from his regiment, receives Rs. 304. 14. 2 + Rs. 677. 6. 11 + Rs. 304. 14. 2 = Rs. 513. 11. 7.\nSurgeon-Major under 20 years' service in substantive charge of ditto ... Rs. per mensem.\n\nSurgeon-Captain above 5 years' full-pay service in substantive charge of a Native regiment ... 600 with Rs. 90, horse allowance in Cavalry regiments.\n\nSurgeon-Captain or Surgeon-Lieutenant under 5 years' ditto in substantive charge of a Native regiment ... 450 with Rs. 60 ditto.\n\n20. The salaries of other substantive medical appointments in the Civil and Military Departments are consolidated, and vary from Rs. 1,800 to Rs. 400 per mensem.\n\n21. Qualified Officers of the Medical Service are also eligible for appointments in the Assay Department. The salaries of these appointments are from Government of India, No. 29, dated 27th January, 1876.\n\nRs. 600 to Rs. 2,250 per mensem.\n\n22. Officers are required to perform two years' regimental duty in India before they can be considered eligible for civil employment.\n\nDespatch to the Government of India, No. 235, dated 16th November, 1866, para. 7.\n\n23. No officer, however employed, can receive any staff allowance in addition to the pay laid down in para. 17 unless he has passed the examination in Hindustani known as the \"Lower Standard.\" The passing of this examination does not of itself bring any increase of pay to an officer, unless appointed to a substantive or officiating charge; but failure to pass disqualifies an officer, even when holding such substantive or officiating charge, from receiving any portion of the staff allowances of the appointment.\n\n24. Surgeon-Major-Generals and Surgeon-Colonels, on vacating office at the expiration of the five years' tour of duty, are permitted to draw in India respectively an unemployed salary of Rs. 1,200 per mensem in the former, and Rs. 900 in the latter case, for a period of six months from the date of their vacating office, after which they are placed while unemployed on the following scale of pay:\n\n| Surgeon-Major-General | Surgeon-Colonel |\n|-----------------------|----------------|\n| Per diem              | Per diem       |\n| \u00a3 s. d.               | \u00a3 s. d.        |\n| After 30 years' service on full pay ... | 2 5 0 | 1 14 0 |\n| \" 25 \"                | 2 5 0 | 1 10 0 |\n| \" 20 \"                | or on promotion, should this period of service not be completed | 2 0 0 | 1 8 0 |\n\nLEAVE RULES.\n\n(Paras. 25 (2) to 29 apply only to officers in Military employ.)\n\n25. Officers of the Indian Medical Service, below the rank of Surgeon-Colonel may be granted:\n\n(1.) Privilege leave under such regulations as may from time to time be in force.\n\n(2.) Leave out of India, for no longer period than one year, capable of extension to two years' absence from duty, on the following pay:\n\n| After arrival in India, on first appointment | 200 a year. |\n| After the commencement of the 5th year's service for pension | 250 \" |\n| Ditto, ditto, 10th ditto | 500 \" |\n| Ditto, ditto, 15th ditto | 400 \" |\n| Ditto, ditto, 20th ditto | 450 \" |\n| Ditto, ditto, 25th ditto | 500 \" |\n\n(3.) Leave in India, but for the period of one year only, on full military pay and half the Staff salary appointment.\n\n26. No extension of leave involving absence from duty for more than two years, whether taken in or out of India, can be granted except on specially urgent grounds and without pay.\n\n27. An officer unable on account of the state of his health to return to duty within the maximum period of two years' absence, unless he is under para. 26 specially granted an extension of leave without pay, is placed on temporary half-pay or the retired list, as the circumstances of the case may require. An officer is also liable to be placed on half-pay or the retired list should his health require an undue amount of leave, whether in or out of India.\n\n28. Leave may be granted at any time, but solely at the discretion of the Commanders-in-Chief, or of the Local Governments in India in the case of officers not under the direct orders of a Commander-in-Chief.\n29. An officer on leave, whether in India or out of India, is required to rejoin at once on being recalled to duty, unless certified by a Medical Board as unfit to do so.\n\n30. Officers of the Administrative Grades may be granted one period of leave not exceeding eight months during their tenure of appointment.\n\nHONOURS AND REWARDS.\n\n31. Officers of the Indian Medical Service are eligible for the military distinction of the Order of the Bath and Despatch to the Government of India, No. 24, of 25th Jan., 1866.\n\nSix of the most meritorious officers are named Honorary Physicians, and six are named Royal Warrant, 30th April, Honorary Surgeons to Her Majesty.\n\n1887, Art. 12.\n\nRETIRING PENSIONS AND HALF-PAY.\n\n32. Officers of the Indian Medical Service are allowed to retire on the following scale of pension, on completion of the required periods of service:\n\nDespatch to Government of India, No. 112, dated 14th April, 1881.\n\n| After 30 years' service for pension | ... | ... | \u00a3700 |\n| \" 25 \" \" \" \" \" \" \" \" \" \" \" \" | ... | ... | \u00a3500 |\n| \" 20 \" \" \" \" \" \" \" \" \" \" \" \" | ... | ... | \u00a3365 |\n| \" 17 \" \" \" \" \" \" \" \" \" \" \" \" | ... | ... | \u00a3292 |\n\n33. Time of service for pension reckons from date of first commission, and includes all leave taken under the rules quoted in paras. 25 to 30. (See also para 40.)\n\n34. A Surgeon-Major-General, after five years' active employment in India in that appointment, is entitled to retire upon a pension of \u00a3350 per annum, in addition to that to which he may be entitled under the above scale.\n\nDespatch to Government of India, No. 349, dated 7th November, 1864, paras. 36 to 38.\n\n35. A Surgeon-Colonel is entitled, after five years' active employment in India in that appointment, to retire upon a pension of \u00a3250 per annum, in addition to the pension to which he may be entitled under the above scale.\n\n36. In each of the above cases stated in paras. 34 and 35 eight months' absence on leave is allowed to count towards actual service in those grades. (See para. 30.)\n\n37. A Surgeon-Major-General or Surgeon-Colonel who has completed his term of service and has reverted to British pay may reside in Europe, at the same time qualifying for higher pension.\n\nDespatch to the Government of India, No. 166, dated 24th June, 1869, para. 17.\n\n38. With a view to maintain the efficiency of the service, all officers of the rank of Brigade-Surgeon-Lieutenant-Colonel, Surgeon-Lieutenant-Colonel, and Surgeon-Major are placed on the Retired List when they have attained the age of 55 years, and all Surgeon-Major-Generals and Surgeon-Colonels when they have attained the age of 60 years. In any special case, where it would appear to be for the good of the service that the officer should continue in employment, he may be so continued, subject in each case to the sanction of the Secretary of State for India in Council.\n\n39.

These rules shall apply to\u2014\n\n(a) All combatants and medical warrant officers of the Indian Army promoted to warrant rank on or after the date of their publication.\n\n(b) Honorary commissioned officers, senior assistant-surgeons, and warrant officers who may elect them within one year of the date of their publication.\n\n2. Those who apply for leave of any kind within one year of the date of publication of these rules must make their election when submitting their applications for leave; all others, whether on duty or on furlough or leave on the date of publication of these rules, may elect at convenience within the specified time.\n\n3. All honorary commissioned officers, senior assistant-surgeons, and warrant officers who elect these rules will come under their provisions from the date of the receipt of their applications at Army Headquarters, or by the Governments of India, Madras, or Bombay, or at the India Office if at home; and they will be entitled to count all past furlough and leave as service for pension under Rule V.\n\n4. Those who elect these rules while on furlough or leave under older regulations will be allowed the option of continuing to draw any furlough or leave allowances they may be in receipt of under those regulations, if more advantageous, until the expiry of such furlough or leave or any extension thereof, subject to the limit of two years' absence from duty.\n\n5. It must be clearly understood that honorary commissioned officers, senior assistant-surgeons, or warrant officers who do not elect these rules within the period stated will be held to have declined them, and will be allowed no further opportunity of electing them.\n\nRules.\n\nI. An honorary commissioned officer, senior assistant-surgeon, or warrant officer subject to these rules may be granted\u2014\n\n(a) Privilege leave under such regulations as may from time to time be in force.\n\n(b) Leave in or out of India for one year, capable of extension to two years' absence from duty under conditions stated below.\n\nII. During any time within one year spent on leave in India other than privilege leave an honorary commissioned officer or combatant warrant officer will draw the warrant pay and allowances of his rank and the half staff salary of his appointment, or, if the pay of his appointment be a consolidated salary, then the warrant pay and allowances of his rank and half the difference between such pay and allowances and his consolidated salary; and within the same period a member of the Subordinate Medical Department will draw three-fourths of his grade pay and of his house rent. After one year, and up to the limit of two years, an honorary commissioned officer or combatant warrant officer will draw half of the warrant pay and allowances of his rank and of the staff salary of his appointment, or half of his consolidated salary, as the case may be; and a member of the Subordinate Medical Department will draw half of his grade pay and of his house rent.\nDuring leave out of India the following rates of pay will be drawn:\n\n| Position                        | Per annum |\n|---------------------------------|-----------|\n| Deputy Commissary               | \u00a3210      |\n| Assistant                       | \u00a3150      |\n| Deputy Assistant Commissary     | \u00a3110      |\n| Conductor                       | \u00a378       |\n| Sub-Conductor                   | \u00a372       |\n| Senior Assistant-Surgeon, 1st Grade | \u00a3170   |\n| \"                               | \u00a3120      |\n| Assistant-Surgeon, 1st Grade    | \u00a385       |\n| \"                               | \u00a365       |\n| Assistant Apothecary, 1st Grade | \u00a350       |\n| \"                               | \u00a340       |\n| Sub-Assistant Apothecary        | \u00a339       |\n\nIII. Leave may be granted at any time at the discretion of the Commanders-in-Chief of the several Armies, the Governor-General in Council, or the Governors in Council, as the case may be.\n\nIV. Leave in or out of India in excess of one year cannot be claimed as a right, but extensions for any period up to two years' absence from duty in all may be granted on medical certificate or on special or urgent grounds, at the discretion of the sanctioning authority. The previous assent of the authority under whom the individual may be serving will be required for such extensions, except on medical certificate, and must be obtained by the applicant. Extensions beyond two years' absence from duty will only be admissible in very special cases, and without any pay whatever.\n\nV. Leave in or out of India will reckon as service for pension, and will not involve forfeiture of appointment.\n\nVI. Leave will commence on the date of being struck off duty, except that in the case of an officer having to leave his own station to appear before a Medical Board at another station, the date of being struck off duty will mean the date on which he quits the station where he is examined and invalided. In cases of leave out of India on medical certificate the period of leave recommended by a Medical Board as necessary will be held to commence on the date of quitting India; the interval between being struck off duty and quitting India will be leave in India. In all cases, however, an officer will be due to rejoin his appointment at the expiry of the period granted to him, the day on which he rejoins it being reckoned as a day of duty.\n\nVII. An honorary commissioned officer, senior assistant-surgeon, or warrant officer unable on account of ill health to return to his duty within the maximum period of two years' absence will, unless specially granted leave without pay, be placed on temporary half-pay, or on the retired list, according to the circumstances of his case. An undue amount of leave on account of ill health will likewise render an officer liable to be transferred to half-pay or to the retired list, and the power of such transfer will be exercised by the Government of the Presidency or the Secretary of State for India, as the case may be.\n\nVIII. An honorary commissioned officer, senior assistant-surgeon, or warrant officer on leave in or out of India will be required to rejoin his appointment at once on being recalled to duty on account of the exigencies of the service, unless pronounced by a Medical Board to be unfit to do so. He will be granted a free passage or not, according to the transport regulations in force at the time.\n\nIX. When it may be necessary to convert sterling rates of pay under these rules into rupee currency, or vice versa, the conversion will be made at the rate of exchange in force for the period when the pay becomes due, as fixed annually for the adjustment of financial transactions between the Indian and Imperial Governments.\n\nX. The rules which govern the allowances of honorary commissioned officers, senior assistant-surgeons, and warrant officers acting for absentees remain unchanged.\n\nXI. Advances of pay on proceeding on, or returning from, leave will be granted in accordance with the rules laid down in Army Regulations, India, Vol. I., Part I.\n\nXII. The Secretary of State for India in Council reserves the right of making any change in the foregoing rules which circumstances may require.\n\nCONDITIONS OF TRANSFER OF HONORARY COMMISSIONED AND WARRANT OFFICERS TO TEMPORARY HALF-PAY.\n\n(Sanctioned by Despatch to Government of India, No. 25, dated 24th January, 1884.)\n\nAn honorary commissioned or warrant officer transferred to temporary half-pay may be permitted to remain on half-pay till his total continuous absence from duty, on furlough and half-pay together, amounts to four years. If then still unfit to return to duty, he must be pensioned on the rate of pension for which he had qualified at the time of being placed on half-pay.\n\nNo period spent on half-pay will count as service for Indian pension, nor will an honorary commissioned or warrant officer be eligible for promotion while he is on half-pay. An honorary commissioned or warrant officer replaced on the effective list, on return from half-pay, will be re-employed at once, being borne as a supernumerary in his grade until absorbed by the next vacancy.\n\nHonorary commissioned and warrant officers will be required to appear before a Medical Board at the expiration of one year on half-pay, and again, if retained on the half-pay list, at the end of the second year; and those who, in view to being restored to the effective list, may wish to appear before the Board at other times than those specified, may be permitted to do so. Honorary commissioned or warrant officers ordered periodically to appear before the Board will be allowed, in this country, their bona fide travelling expenses, and lodging allowance at\nthe rates stated below, but those appearing at other times, and at their own wish, must do so at their own expense.\n\nRates of Lodging Allowance.\n\n| Deputy Commissary | Senior Assistant Surgeon |\n|-------------------|-------------------------|\n| 2s. 3d. per diem. | 2s. 3d. per diem.       |\n\nPENSION REGULATIONS FOR HONORARY COMMISSIONED AND WARRANT OFFICERS.\n\n(These Rules took effect from the 1st September, 1881.)\n\n1.

Furlough not taken at the time it becomes due is not lost, and can, subject to these Regulations, be taken later.\n\nII.\u2014An officer may not be absent from duty on any grounds for more than three years consecutively, nor on return from furlough may he receive, except under Rule VII., any further furlough until after an interval of three years.\n\nIII.\u2014*Furlough may be spent anywhere, and when it has been earned by length of service, counts as service for pension. Furlough taken before it is earned by length of service reckons against service for pension till paid off.\n\nIV.\u2014An officer on furlough receives half the pay of his rank, or if holding a shore appointment, half the pay of his appointment, excluding command, charge, acting, personal, or house allowance, computed according to a rate of exchange to be fixed in each year by the Secretary of State. An officer promoted while on furlough will be entitled to a moiety of the increased pay due to that promotion.\n\nV.\u2014\u2020An officer proceeding on or returning from furlough may be granted an advance of three months' furlough pay; and he may further\u2021 be granted the advance in aid of passage money specified in clause IX. if he does not obtain passage by troopship. Advances made in England will be recovered in India by monthly instalments of one-fourth of the pay drawn by the officers. Advances made in India will be noted on the last pay certificates of officers, and no issue of furlough pay will be made till after the sum advanced has accrued as furlough pay.\n\nVI.\u2014Furlough pay may not be drawn for more than two years consecutively.\n\nVII.\u2014Upon certificate of a Medical Board, an officer not entitled to furlough, who has served not less than one year in India, may be granted furlough. Such furlough will not count of service for pension until it has been paid off by subsequent service under the terms of Rule I. Furlough cannot be anticipated beyond two years in the aggregate, nor for a second term, unless that previously anticipated has been subsequently paid off under the terms of Rule I.\n\nVIII.\u2014An officer who has exhausted the furlough obtainable under these Rules, and who may be certified by a Medical Board to be still unfit for duty, will be retired on the pension or gratuity to which he may be entitled; if not entitled to either pension or gratuity, his case will be specially considered (but see under heading \"Temporary Retirement,\" on p. lxxxvi.).\n\nIX.\u2014\u00a7Marine officers not holding shore appointments of Rs. 1,000 per mensem will be eligible for the grant of non-regulation passages in troopships when such passages are available. Officers who do not obtain passages in troopships will be allowed advances\u2020 in aid of passage-money, in addition to the advances admissible under Clause V., provided that no officer shall in any case draw advances exceeding three months' pay in all.\n\nX.\u2014Furlough, whether on private affairs or on medical certificate, is restricted to a maximum period of one year in the first instance, and to subsequent extensions not exceeding six months at a time.\n\nGeneral Leave.\n\nXI.\u2014General leave may be granted for any period not exceeding six months at a time, but cannot be renewed, except for very urgent reasons, till after two years have elapsed from its expiration. It may be spent anywhere, does not involve forfeiture of appointment, and counts as service for pension. It will be granted or refused entirely at the discretion of the Director of the Indian Marine. It may be granted up to a maximum limit of 30 days as subsidiary to furlough, whether on proceeding on furlough or on return from furlough. Leave granted as subsidiary to furlough can only be spent in India.\n\nXII.\u2014During general leave an officer will be restricted to the pay of his grade,|| and will forfeit all allowances, which will be paid to his locum tenens. If an officer exceeds the six months' leave admissible at one time under this Rule, the entire period will be converted into furlough, and his allowances adjusted accordingly.\n\n* As modified by Marine Circular, No. 6 of 1885.\n\u2020 As modified by Marine Circular, No. 7 of 1886.\n\u2021 Unless holding shore appointments of Rs. 1,000 per mensem. Such officers are ineligible for passage by troopship (cl. ix.) and are also ineligible for any advance exceeding three months' Furlough pay (Marine Circular, No. 1 of 1883).\n\u00a7 As modified by Marine Circular, No. 31 of 1885.\n|| This Rule will also hold good in the case of an officer holding a shore appointment, in which case the balance will be considered a staff allowance payable to the locum tenens provided the latter does not thereby draw more than the pay of the appointment.\nPrivilege Leave.\n\nXIII.\u2014Subject to the exigencies of the service, Marine officers may be allowed 60 days' privilege leave during each year, and each leave may be taken in instalments.\n\nXIV.\u2014An officer who has privilege leave to his credit when proceeding on leave or furlough does not forfeit it, but privilege leave cannot be taken in continuation of furlough, nor can furlough be obtained in continuation of privilege leave. Privilege leave may, however, be converted into general leave with the sanction of the Director of the Indian Marine, or into furlough with the sanction of the Government of India.\n\nXV.\u2014Privilege leave will be granted by the Director of the Indian Marine, but it will be granted only on the understanding that no additional expense is thereby caused to the State, either directly or indirectly, that the applicant's services can be spared, and that satisfactory arrangements for the performance of his duties during his absence can be made.\n\nXVI.\u2014Officers are at liberty to proceed wherever they may desire when on privilege leave, provided they can ensure their return before the expiration of the leave. If an officer exceeds his privilege leave, the whole period of his absence will be converted into general leave or furlough, and his allowances and statement of service for furlough adjusted accordingly.\n\nTemporary Leave.\n\nXVII.\u2014Temporary leave not exceeding 10 days, and not in anticipation or extension of any kind of leave or furlough, may be granted by the Director and Deputy Director of the Indian Marine.\n\nXVIII.\u2014Temporary leave not exceeding 72 hours may be granted by commanders of vessels and heads of departments to officers under their command.\n\nGeneral Regulations.\n\nXIX.\u2014It must be distinctly understood that furlough or leave cannot be claimed as a right. Both are subject to the exigencies of the public service, and will be granted only when an officer's services can be spared. Commanders of vessels and heads of departments will not forward an application for furlough or leave unless they are able to satisfy the Director of the Indian Marine that the officer's services can be spared without any inconvenience to the public service.\n\nXX.\u2014No grant of leave given under the conditions of these Rules will count against an officer's service for pension, and leave may be spent anywhere, i.e., within possible limits of return before it expires.\n\nXXI.\u2014Leave is reckoned from the day on which an officer avails himself of it, and it expires on the day he rejoins.\n\nFurlough reckons from date of leaving India, or from date of leaving his ship if at an out-station, unless specially stated by authority to commence on an earlier date; and in the event of an officer returning to India before the expiration of his furlough, it ceases on the date of his return.\n\nThe day of return, whether from leave or from furlough, is a day of duty.\n\nXXII.\u2014Officers on furlough will draw their pay from the India Office, but officers on general or privilege leave must arrange to draw their pay in India.\n\nXXIII.\u2014As a rule leave will be granted only during the period of the south-west monsoon.\n\nXXIV.\u2014Officers proceeding on furlough will report their departure personally at the office of the Director or Deputy Director of the Indian Marine, except when they avail themselves of it at an out-station. An officer returning from furlough or leave will rejoin the ship to which he belongs; but if this is impracticable, and he has not received instructions (which he should apply for beforehand), he will rejoin at Bombay or Calcutta, reporting himself in person to the Director or Deputy Director. On the departure of an officer on furlough or leave, or on the return of an officer therefrom, the commander of the vessel will cause an entry to be made of the date in the ship's log-book, and will forward an extract thereof by the next post to the Director.\n\nXXV.\u2014Officers arriving in Europe on furlough or on general leave* must report their arrival in writing to the Military Secretary at the India Office, and state their address; and for extension of furlough or for permission to return to duty, they must also apply to the Military Secretary. \u2020Before applying for extension of furlough on private affairs they must obtain permission to do so from the Government of India, through the Director of Marine. The permission thus obtained must be attached to the application for extension, and submitted to the Military Secretary at the India Office.\n\nOfficers proceeding to the colonies on furlough should apply to India for extension of furlough and for permission to return to duty.\n\nXXVI.\u2014During the absence of an officer on leave or furlough, he must keep the Director of the Indian Marine acquainted with his actual address, and be prepared to return immediately to India, should his services be required. When on leave, such recall order will be issued by the Director; when on furlough in Europe, by the Secretary of State. Officers spending their furlough in Europe must keep the Secretary of State informed of their address.\n\nXXVII.\u2014Applications for leave or furlough must be made on the authorised form, which is obtainable from the Director or Deputy Director of the Indian Marine.\n\nNote.\u2014(Marine Circular No. 10 of 1885).\n\nThe above rules are applicable to\u2014\n\nI.\u2014Officers on the Graded and Supernumerary List of Executive Officers.\n\nII.\u2014Officers on the Graded List of Engineers.\n\nIII.\u2014Gazetted clerks,\n\nIV.\u2014Warrant officers who may be specially admitted to the rules.\n\nDATED 26TH APRIL, 1892.\n\nMajesty's Secretary of State for India, to publish the following revised rules regarding the grant of leave to officers of the Royal Indian Marine.\n\n* Marine Circular No. 19 of 1888.\n\n\u2020 Marine Circular No. 3 of 1889.\n2. These rules shall apply to\u2014\n\n(a) All officers appointed to the Indian Marine after the date of their publication.\n\n(b) Officers who may elect them within one year of the date of their publication.\n\nNote.\u2014The term \"officers\" includes the Graded and Supernumerary List of Executive Officers and the Graded List of Engineers.\n\n3. Those who apply for leave of any kind within one year of the date of publication of these rules must make their election when submitting their applications for leave; all others, whether on duty or on furlough or leave on the date of publication of these rules, may elect at convenience within the specified time.\n\n4. All officers who elect these rules will come under their provisions from the date of the receipt of their applications by the Government of India if they are in India, or at the India Office if they are at home; and they will be entitled to count all past furlough and leave as service for pension under Rule V.\n\n5. Those who elect these rules while on furlough or general leave under the previous regulations will be allowed the option of continuing to draw any furlough or leave allowances they may be in receipt of under those regulations, if more advantageous, until the expiry of such furlough or general leave or any extension thereof which would have been admissible under the previous regulations, subject to the limit of two years' absence from duty.\n\n6. It must be clearly understood that officers who do not elect these rules within the period stated will be held to have declined them, and will be allowed no further opportunity of electing them.\n\n7. \"General leave\" and \"subsidiary leave\" will not be granted to officers under these rules.\n\nRules.\n\nI.\u2014An officer subject to these rules may be granted\u2014\n\n(a) Privilege leave and temporary leave under such regulations as may from time to time be in force.\n\n(b) Leave in or out of India for one year, capable of extension to two years' absence from duty under conditions stated below.\n\nLeave in or out of India other than privilege or temporary leave.\n\nII.\u2014During leave in or out of India other than privilege or temporary leave, the following rates of pay will be drawn, whether an officer holds a shore appointment or not:\n\n| Commanders, 1st Grade | Rs. per mensem. |\n|-----------------------|---------------|\n|                       | 410           |\n| 2nd Grade             | 330           |\n| 3rd Grade             | 280           |\n| 1st-Grade officers of six years' seniority | 210 |\n| 1st-Grade officers of three years' seniority | 170 |\n| under ditto            | 130           |\n| 2nd-Grade officers     | 120           |\n| 3rd-Grade officers     | 110           |\n| Chief Engineers on Rs. 400 per mensem | 320 |\n| on Rs. 300 per mensem  | 270           |\n| Engineers on Rs. 250   | 230           |\n| on Rs. 225             | 215           |\n| on Rs. 200             | 200           |\n| on Rs. 175             | 190           |\n| Assistant Engineers on Rs. 150 | 165 |\n| on Rs. 125             | 150           |\n\nAn officer promoted while on leave will be entitled to the higher rate of leave pay from date of promotion.\n\nIII.\u2014Leave may be granted at any time at the discretion of the Government of India, on the recommendation of the Director of the Royal Indian Marine. (See addendum in No. 13 of 1892.)\n\nIV.\u2014Extensions of leave in or out of India in excess of one year, but not exceeding two years' absence from duty in all, may be granted on medical certificate or on special or urgent grounds, at the discretion of the sanctioning authority. The previous assent of the Government of India will be required for extensions, except on medical certificate, and must be obtained by the applicant through the Director of the Royal Indian Marine. Extensions beyond two years' absence from duty will only be admissible in very special cases, and without any pay whatever.\n\nV.\u2014Leave in or out of India will reckon as service for pension.\n\nVI.\u2014Leave will commence on the date of being struck off duty, except that in the case of an officer having to appear before a Medical Board the date of being struck off duty will mean the date on which he quits the station where he is examined and invalided. In cases of leave out of India on medical certificate the period of leave recommended by a Medical Board as necessary will be held to commence on the date of quitting India. In all cases, however, an officer will be due to rejoin his ship or appointment at the expiry of the period granted to him, the day on which he rejoins it being reckoned as a day of duty.\n\nVII.\u2014An officer unable on account of ill health to return to his duty within the maximum period of two years' absence will, unless specially granted leave without pay, be placed on temporary or permanent retirement, according to the circumstances of his case. An undue amount of leave on account of ill health will likewise render an officer liable to be transferred to temporary or permanent retirement.\n\nVIII.\u2014An officer on leave in or out of India will be required to rejoin his appointment at once on being recalled to duty on account of the exigencies of the service, unless pronounced by a Medical Board to be unfit to do so.\n\nIX.\u2014An officer proceeding on leave will report his departure personally at the office of the Director or Deputy Director of the Royal Indian Marine, except when he avails himself of it at an out-station. Except when ordered to the contrary, all officers returning from leave will report themselves to the Director of the Royal Indian Marine at Bombay.\n\nAn officer arriving in Europe on leave must report his arrival in writing to the Military Secretary at the India Office, and state his address; and for extension of leave or for permission to return to duty, he must also apply to the Military Secretary. An officer applying for extension of leave on private affairs must, except in very special or urgent circumstances, attach an intimation of the assent of the Government of India.\n\nAn officer proceeding to the Colonies on leave should apply to India for extensions of leave and for permission to return to duty.\n\nX.\u2014Leave pay under these rules, when issued out of India, will be converted into sterling at\nthe official rate of exchange in force for the period when the pay becomes due, as fixed annually for the adjustment of financial transactions between the India and Imperial Governments.\n\nXI.\u2014Advances not exceeding three months' full pay of grade, subject to a limit of 100l. to Commanders, and 65l. to officers of junior rank, will be allowed on proceeding on or returning from leave, and on returning from temporary retirement. Advances made in England will be recovered in India by monthly instalments of one-fourth of the pay drawn by the officers. Advances made in India will be noted on the last pay certificates of officers, and no issue of leave pay will be made till after the sum advanced has accrued as such. In case of death no recovery of advances made under this rule is to be effected from the estate of the deceased officer.\n\nXII.\u2014Marine officers not holding shore appointments of 1,000 rupees per mensem will be eligible for the grant of non-regulation passages in troopships when such passages are available.\n\nPrivileges and Temporary Leave under these Rules.\n\nXIII.\u2014Subject to the exigencies of the service, Marine officers may be allowed 60 days' privilege leave during each year, and such leave may be taken in instalments.\n\nXIV.\u2014Accumulated privilege leave for 90 days may be granted to an officer who has no privilege leave during the preceding 33 months, but no \"leave in or out of India,\" if exceeding six months, can be counted as part of the fixed 33 months.\n\nXV.\u2014An officer who has privilege leave (ordinary or accumulated) at his credit, when proceeding on \"leave in or out of India,\" does not forfeit it, but privilege leave cannot be taken in continuation of \"leave in or out of India,\" nor can \"leave in or out of India\" be taken in continuation of privilege leave.\n\nPrivilege leave may, however, be converted into \"leave in or out of India\" with the sanction of the Government of India.\n\nXVI.\u2014An officer returning from accumulated privilege leave granted in one year and extending into the next is eligible for ordinary privilege leave during the period when such leave is available in the year in which he returns, provided he rejoins before proceeding on ordinary privilege leave.\n\nXVII.\u2014Privilege leave will be granted by the Director of the Royal Indian Marine, but only on the understanding that no additional expense is thereby caused to the State either directly or indirectly, that the applicant's services can be spared, and that satisfactory arrangements for the performance of his duties during his absence can be made.\n\nXVIII.\u2014Privilege leave (ordinary or accumulated) reckons as service for pension.\n\nXIX.\u2014As a rule privilege leave will only be granted during the period of the south-west monsoon.\n\nXX.\u2014Officers are at liberty to proceed wherever they may desire when on privilege leave, provided they can ensure their return before the expiration of the leave. If an officer exceeds his privilege leave the whole period of his absence will be converted into \"leave in or out of India,\" and his allowances and statement of service for \"leave in or out of India\" adjusted accordingly.\n\nXXI.\u2014Privilege leave is reckoned from the day on which an officer avails himself of it, and it expires on the day he rejoins, the day of return being reckoned as a day of duty.\n\nXXII.\u2014An officer of the floating establishment returning from privilege leave will, if possible, rejoin the ship to which he belongs, but if this is impracticable, and he has not received instructions (which he should apply for beforehand), he will rejoin at Bombay or Calcutta, reporting himself in person to the Director or Deputy Director. On the departure of an officer on privilege leave or on the return of an officer therefrom, the Commander of the vessel will cause an entry to be made of the date in the ship's log, and will forward an extract thereof by the next post to the Director.\n\nXXIII.\u2014Temporary leave not exceeding 10 days' and not in anticipation or in extension of any other kind of leave, may be granted by the Director and Deputy Director of the Royal Indian Marine.\n\nXXIV.\u2014Temporary leave not exceeding 72 hours may be granted by Commanders of vessels and heads of departments to officers under their command.\n\nGeneral Regulations.\n\nXXV.\u2014It must be distinctly understood that leave in or out of India, or privilege leave, cannot be claimed as a right. Both are subject to the exigencies of the public service, and will be granted only when an officer's services can be spared. Commanders of vessels and heads of departments will not forward an application for privilege or other leave unless they are able to satisfy the Director of the Royal Indian Marine that the officer's services can be spared without any inconvenience to the public service.\n\nXXVI.\u2014An officer who has not completed his term of probation for the Marine service cannot be granted leave with retention of his probationary appointment in excess of three months.\n\nXXVII.\u2014The name of an officer granted leave out of India (other than privilege leave), will be removed from the ship on which borne, and he will draw his pay during such leave\u2014\n\n(a) if proceeded to Europe, through the India Office.\n\n(b) if proceeded to any colony named in the list in Appendix No. 17 of the Civil Service Regulations, in such colony.\n\nHe can, however, draw his leave pay in India if he prefers it.\n\nXXVIII.\u2014The name of an officer, granted leave in India (other than privilege leave), will be removed from the ship on which borne, and he will draw his pay during such time from any treasury in India in communication with the Examiner of Marine Accounts.\n\nXXIX.\u2014The name of an officer, granted privilege leave (ordinary or accumulated), will continue on the books of his ship, and he will draw his pay either from the ship or from any treasury in India or through a bank or agent, as may be arranged through the Examiner of Marine Accounts.\n\nXXX.\u2014During the absence of an officer on leave (privilege or otherwise), he must keep the Director of the Royal Indian Marine acquainted with his actual address and be prepared to\nreturn immediately to India, should his services be required. When on privilege leave, such recall order will be issued by the Director; when on leave in Europe (other than privilege), by the Secretary of State. Officers spending their leave (other than privilege) in Europe must keep the Secretary of State informed of their address.\n\nXXXI.\u2014The Secretary of State in Council reserves to himself the right of making any change in the foregoing rules which circumstances may require.\n\nMARINE CIRCULAR No. 13, DATED 6TH OCTOBER, 1891\n\n(As revised by Marine Circular No. 3, dated 1st August, 1893).\n\nRules for the Instruction in England of Officers of the Royal Indian Marine in Gunnery and the use of Torpedoes, and in other scientific branches of their profession.\n\nIn supersession of Marine Circular No. 7, of the 27th April, 1891, the Governor-General in Council is pleased, with the approval of the Secretary of State for India, to notify the following rules for the instruction in England of officers of the Royal Indian Marine in gunnery and the use of torpedoes, and in other scientific branches of their profession.\n\n2. All officers and engineers of the Royal Indian Marine, whether in India or on leave or furlough in England, are at liberty to apply for permission to attend all courses and classes open to officers or engineers of the Royal Navy on full pay, including the courses at the Royal Naval College, Greenwich.\n\n3. There will in future be no restriction on the number of officers or engineers undergoing instruction at the same time.\n\n4. The courses are:\n\nFor Officers\u2014\n\n(I.) Short course for Lieutenants, consisting of eight weeks' each of gunnery and torpedo.\n\n(II.) The session of the Royal Naval College, Greenwich, for Captains, Commanders, Lieutenants, and Navigating Officers, which commences on the 1st October in each year, and lasts till the 30th June following.\n\nFor Engineers\u2014\n\n(I.) Course on board the \"Vernon\" and \"Excellent;\" the former beginning in January, March, and April, and lasting for 45 days each; the latter commencing in February, April, and June, and lasting for 25 days each.\n\n(II.) A course at the Royal Naval College, Greenwich, which usually begins in October of each year.\n\n5. Every officer or engineer permitted to attend a course will be on duty for the period he may be under instruction, and if on leave or furlough, except leave on medical certificate, such period will be reckoned as in addition to his leave or furlough.\n\n6. Officers and engineers attending courses will be entitled to full grade pay, together with subsistence and travelling allowances for that period.\n\n7. Officers and engineers failing to qualify, except on account of sickness, will, if on leave or furlough, lose all the advantages of being on duty during the period of instruction; that is to say, they will be restricted to their grade or furlough pay, as the case may be.\n\n8. It is therefore to be understood that officers and engineers while under instruction will be granted their full pay, subject to adjustment under paragraph 7, but the subsistence allowance will be withheld until the termination of the course, as it will only be admissible to officers who pass.\n\n9. Should the Government of India select an officer or engineer to undergo instruction at home, either on board the training ships or at the Royal Naval College, Greenwich, or elsewhere, or to go through a combined course at more than one centre of instruction, he will be given a free passage to England and back, and will be considered on duty while under instruction, and will also receive full pay and subsistence and travelling allowances, subject to the operation of Rule 8.\n\n10. If an officer so selected and sent to England at the public expense fails to obtain a certificate at the termination of the course, he will be placed on furlough pay for the period of his absence from India.\n\n11. The cases of all officers prevented by sickness from completing a course of instruction will be considered as they arise.\n\n12. In forwarding applications from officers on leave or furlough for permission to undergo instruction, the Director of the Royal Indian Marine should be careful to see that no infringement of the furlough regulations is likely to take place from the application being granted. No officer will be selected who has not sufficient leave unexpired at the commencement of the course to enable him to return to duty on its termination, or who cannot be granted an extension of leave under existing furlough rules.\n\n13. The Director of the Royal Indian Marine should also satisfy himself that applicants are likely to qualify in the subject in which they desire to receive instruction. In the case of Engineer officers desirous of being admitted to study at the Royal Naval College, Greenwich, the Director will, before forwarding their applications, cause them to pass an examination based on that which has to be undergone by Engineer students of the Royal Navy.\n\n14. Officers in future, when applying for permission to attend courses of instruction, should specify the particular course or courses which they desire to enter. Their applications should\nbe forwarded to the Government of India in time to allow of the Secretary of State's sanction being obtained before the commencement of the course; and recommendations for permission to allow officers to undergo instruction should be made by the Director of the Royal Indian Marine as soon after their departure from India as possible, especially in the case of officers on general leave.\n\n15. The subjects of examination at the Royal Naval College, Greenwich, will be\u2014\n\nI.\u2014Mathematics;\nII.\u2014Navigation, theoretical and practical;\nIII.\u2014Compass adjustment;\nIV.\u2014Steam;\nV.\u2014Physics, only magnetism (but with electricity for those passing to the \"Vernon\" for torpedo course);\nVI.\u2014Surveying;\n\nand 40 per cent. of marks upon these subjects on the papers set to the senior officers will entitle officers to a qualifying certificate. If, further, an officer should obtain the honorary certificate, he will have the letter \"G\" placed against his name in the list of officers of the Royal Indian Marine.\n\n16. Officers will be at liberty to take up meteorology, practical astronomy, or any other subjects of the senior officer's course as optional subjects.\n\nROYAL INDIAN MARINE.\n\nPay and Allowances of Officers, Engineers, &c., when on special duty in England.\n\nMARINE CIRCULAR, No. 4, DATED 2ND MARCH, 1883.\n\nIt is notified that officers and engineers of the Indian Marine, on special duty in England, will, on arrival in England, receive the full pay of their grade plus subsistence allowance.\n\nMARINE CIRCULAR, No. 10, DATED 17TH MAY, 1883.\n\nIn continuation of Marine Circular No. 4 of 1883, the Governor-General in Council is pleased, with the sanction of Her Majesty's Government, to notify the following scales of subsistence and travelling allowances for Officers, Engineers, Warrant Officers and others of Her Majesty's Indian Marine, when on special duty in England:\n\nSubsistence Allowance.\n\n| Per diem | s. d. |\n|----------|------|\n| Commanders | 7 6 |\n| 1st-Grade Officers and Chief Engineers | 5 0 |\n| 2nd-Grade Officers and Engineers | 3 6 |\n| 3rd-Grade Officers and Assistant Engineers, and Warrant Officers... | |\n\nTravelling Allowances.\n\n| Per diem | s. d. |\n|----------|------|\n| Commanders | 15 0 |\n| 1st-Grade Officers and Chief Engineers | 10 0 |\n| 2nd-Grade Officers and Engineers | 7 6 |\n| 3rd-Grade Officers and Assistant Engineers | |\n\nConditions of Temporary Retirement of Officers of the Royal Indian Marine.\n\n(Sanctioned by Despatch to Government of India, No. 369, dated 16th December, 1886.)\n\nOfficers of the Royal Indian Marine, who, after exhausting the furlough admissible to them are unfit for service, but not irremediably broken in health, may be temporarily transferred to the retired list. Temporary retirement is subject to the condition that the disease which necessitates it must have been contracted in and by the service.\n\nAn officer granted temporary retirement may be permitted to remain in that position till his total continuous absence from duty, on furlough and temporary retirement together, amounts to four years. If then still unfit to return to duty, he must be placed on the permanent retired list, receiving the pension (if any) or gratuity for which he had qualified at the time of being granted temporary retirement.\n\nNo period spent on temporary retirement will count as service for pension, nor will an officer be eligible for promotion while he is in that position. An officer replaced on the effective list, on becoming fit to return to duty, will be restored to the grade from which he retired, and his name will be placed in the same\nnumerical position in that grade which it occupied at the time of temporary retirement.\n\nOfficers will be required to appear before a Medical Board at the expiration of one year on temporary retirement, and again, if retained in that position, before the end of the second year; and those who, in view to being restored to the effective list, may wish to appear before the Board at other times than those specified, may be permitted to do so. Officers ordered periodically to appear before the Board will be allowed, in the United Kingdom, their bona fide travelling expenses, and lodging allowance at the rates stated below, but those appearing at other times, and at their own wish, must do so at their own expense.\n\nRates of Lodging Allowances.\n\n| Designation                  | s. d. |\n|-----------------------------|-------|\n| Commander                   | 5 0   |\n| First-Grade Officer         | 4 0   |\n| Second or Third Grade Officer | 3 0   |\n| Chief Engineer              | 5 0   |\n| Engineer                    | 4 0   |\n| Assistant Engineer          | 3 0   |\n\nPENSION REGULATIONS OF THE ROYAL INDIAN MARINE.\n\nMARINE CIRCULARS OF THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA, Nos. 13 of 1885 and 13 of 1887.\n\n1. The following is the scale of pensions and compassionate allowances admissible to officers and engineers of Her Majesty's Indian Marine to their families.\n\n2. The service for pension of an officer of the Marine reckons from date of joining his ship or appointment if he is 19 years of age or over; otherwise from date of attaining that age.\n\n3. An officer admitted to the Service after 25 years of age will be subject to reduction of pension in the manner and under the rules laid down in the Civil Pension Code.\n\n4. Retirement at the age of 55 years will be compulsory, and all officers and engineers of that age now in the Service, as well as those who may attain that age within one year, will be required to retire at the expiration of one year from the date of this order. The amount of superannuation pension is that which would be admissible as an invalid pension. (Marine Circular No. 8 of 1888.) Should an officer holding the appointment of Director or Deputy Director of the Indian Marine attain that age during his incumbency, he may, with the approval of the Government of India, complete five years in the appointment.\n\n[This rule will not be applicable to those officers who have already received a special extension of tenure.]\n\n5.

The following extra pension will be granted to an officer of the Indian Marine retiring after five years' service as Deputy Director or Director:\n\n| Service Description | Per annum |\n|---------------------|-----------|\n| For five years' continuous service as Director | Rs. 2,000 |\n| For five years' continuous service as Deputy Director | Rs. 1,000 |\n| For five years' continuous service, partly as Deputy Director and partly as Director, of which not less than two years shall have been as Director | Rs. 1,500 |\n\n7. Service in the survey, or in port or dockyard appointments, gives no claim to any higher position than that fixed for any officer's rank in the Marine. Officers not on the Marine list now serving in such appointments will remain under their present rules.\n\n8. The pensions of warrant officers, gunners, and clerks will be calculated under the rules for the Unconvenanted Service, as laid down in the Civil Pension Code, Rs. 60 per mensem (compensation in lieu of board and lodging) being added to their pay for the calculation of pension.\n\n9. Pensions will be payable in rupees in India. If paid in England, they will be converted at the rate of exchange fixed yearly by the adjustment of financial transactions between the Imperial and Indian Governments subject to a minimum rate of 1s. 9d. per rupee.\n\n10. An officer may be allowed to commute a portion, not exceeding one-third of his pension, the commuted value being payable in India under the rules in Clause 23, India Army Circulars, of 1884.\n\n11. Compassionate allowance on the following scale will be granted to the families of officers who may be drowned or meet with a violent death in the execution of duty:\n\n| Officer Rank                  | Widow          | Child         |\n|------------------------------|----------------|---------------|\n| Commander                    | \u00a3100 a year, or Rs. 100 a month | \u00a320 a year, or Rs. 20 a month |\n| Port Officer                 |                |               |\n| Chief Engineer               |                |               |\n| First-Grade Officer          | \u00a375 a year, or Rs. 75 a month | \u00a315 a year, or Rs. 15 a month |\n| Engineer                     |                |               |\n| Second-Grade Officer         |                |               |\n| Third-Grade Officer          |                |               |\n| Assistant Engineer           | \u00a350 a year, or Rs. 50 a month | \u00a310 a year, or Rs. 10 a month |\n\nThe cases of the families of the Director or Deputy Director will be specially considered.\n\n12. The regulations and conditions under which all such compassionate allowances are to be awarded will be analogous to those prescribed for the military service.\n\nOfficers are required to signify their intention to accept the above pension rules by the 31st December, 1885, otherwise it will be understood that they have decided to remain under the rules now applicable to them.\nINDIAN NURSING SERVICE.\n\nCONDITIONS OF APPOINTMENT, &c.\n\n1. The Nursing Establishment consists of three grades, viz.:\n\n   (1.) Lady Superintendents.\n   (2.) Deputy Superintendents.\n   (3.) Nursing Sisters.\n\nNote.\u2014The term \"lady nurse\" as used in the following paragraphs includes all the above grades.\n\n2. Nursing Sisters must be, at the time of appointment, over 25 and under 35 years of age, and before admission to the service they must be examined by the President of the Medical Board at the India Office as to their fitness for service in India. They must have had at least three years' preliminary training and service combined in a hospital in which adult male patients receive medical and surgical treatment, and in which a staff of Nursing Sisters is maintained.\n\n3. The duration of a term of service, for all grades of lady nurses, is five years, capable of renewal for a further five years at the option of the Government, with the consent of the lady nurse.\n\n4. The engagement may, however, be terminated at any time on six months' notice being given, either on the part of the Government or of the lady nurse (but see para. 12). In this case pay and allowances are not admissible from the date, inclusive, on which the nurse ceases to do duty.\n\nRates of Pay.\n\n(In addition to free quarters, fuel, light, and punkah-pullers.)\n\n5. For a Lady Superintendent* Rs. 300 per mensem.\n   For a Deputy Superintendent ... 200\n   For a Nursing Sister ... 175\n\n6. Leave on medical certificate, up to a maximum of six months during the whole of the five years' term of service, may be granted to a lady nurse by the Principal Medical Officer of Her Majesty's Forces; during such leave she will receive two-thirds of the salary of her grade. Short leave and privilege leave (the latter not to exceed 60 days in each year) may be granted at the discretion of the local authorities and as circumstances may admit.\n\nLeave out of India.\n\n7. After engagement for a second (five years) term of service, a lady nurse may be granted one year's leave from duty, on two-thirds pay, with free passage by sea and rail from and to her station. Such period will not reckon as service in any way. A lady nurse promoted while on leave is not entitled to any increase of leave allowance.\n\nGratuities.\n\n| Deputy Superintendent or Nursing Sister | Lady Superintendent |\n|----------------------------------------|---------------------|\n| For a completed term of five years      | Rs. 500             |\n| For a completed term of ten years      | Rs. 1,500           |\n| If compelled by sickness to leave India before completion of a five years' term, for each complete year's service... | Rs. 75              |\n| If compelled by sickness to leave India after completion of a first term of five years' service, but before completion of a second, for each complete year of the second five years' term, and in addition to the gratuity for the completed term of five years as shown above | Rs. 100             |\n\n* Lady Superintendents appointed before 25th November, 1891, receive in addition a personal allowance of 100 rupees per mensem, which will be continued to them if re-engaged.\n9. No gratuity is given for service terminated by any other cause than sickness or the completion of the terms of 5 and 10 years' service.\n\nPassage, &c.\n\n10. Passage at the public expense, subject to a deduction of 2s. a day for messing while on board ship, is granted to lady nurses when proceeding to India on appointment, when returning home on leave (under paragraph 7) on completion of a term of service, or if invalided home before the completion of a term. They are entitled to take 6 cwt. of baggage. Lady nurses are also entitled to travelling expenses by rail on the above occasions from their places of residence in England to port of embarkation, and from port of disembarkation in India to destination in that country, and vice versa.\n\n11. An outfit allowance on appointment is made at the rate of \u00a325 for each Lady Superintendent, and \u00a315 for each Nursing Sister.\n\n12. A lady nurse who resigns (except on account of ill-health), with less than five years' Indian service, will forthwith refund the sum of \u00a320 in respect of her passage out (or \u00a330 if she have failed to give the notice required by Rule 4), and will not be entitled to a passage home.\n\n13. A lady nurse who has re-engaged for a second term of service in India will be subject to the same penalties if she resigns (except on account of ill-health) without giving six months' notice, but not otherwise.\n\n14. Lady nurses must be prepared to embark, if necessary, not later than 30 days from date of appointment.\n\nDECLARATION.\n\nI,\n\na Candidate for appointment as Nursing Sister in the Indian Nursing Service, do hereby declare that I have answered the following questions to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I am fully aware of the terms and conditions of service [printed on pages 300 and 301] under which I seek appointment, and accept the same.\n\n1.

Its northern base rests upon the Himalayan ranges; the chief part of its western side is washed by the Arabian Sea, and the chief part of its eastern side by the Bay of Bengal. It extends from the eighth degree to the thirty-fifth degree of north latitude; that is to say, from the hottest regions of the equator to far within the temperate zone. The capital, Calcutta, lies in $83^\\circ$ E. long.; so that when the sun sets at six o'clock there, it is just past mid-day in England. The length of India from north to south, and its greatest breadth from east to west, are both about 1,900 miles; but the triangle tapers with a pear-shaped curve to a point at Cape Comorin, its southern extremity. To this compact dominion, the English have added, under the name of Burma, the strip of country lying between India proper on the west, and Chinese and Siamese territory on the north and east, and extending southwards along the eastern shore of the Bay of Bengal. The whole territory thus described contains 1,560,160 square miles, and 287 millions of inhabitants. India, therefore, has an area and a population about equal to the area and population of the whole of Europe, less Russia. Its people more than double Gibbon's estimate of 120 millions for all the races and nations which obeyed Imperial Rome.\n\nIndia is shut off from the rest of Asia on the north by a vast mountainous region, known in the aggregate as the Himalayas. Among their southern ranges lie the independent states of Bhutan and Nepal; the great table-land of Tibet stretches behind. The subordinate native principality of Kashmir, with its dependencies of Hunza, Nagar, Chitral, &c., occupies their north-western Indian angle. At this north-western angle an allied mountain system branches southwards, and separates India from Afghanistan. India is bounded along the west and south-west by the Arabian Sea and Indian Ocean. Turning northwards from its southern extremity at Cape Comorin the Bay of Bengal forms the main part of its eastern boundary. But in the north-east, as in the north-west, India has again a land frontier. The Himalayan ranges at the north-eastern angle of India throw off long spurs and chains to the southward. These spurs separate Assam and Burma from the outlying and semi-independent states and provinces of the Chinese Empire. Proceeding south-eastwards, after touching for a short distance territory under French influence in the basin of the Mekong, the boundary marches with Siam southwards to Point Victoria at the extremity of Tenasserim.\n\nThese are the territorial limits of what is generally understood by the term India; but the political control exercised by the Indian government extends over a considerably larger area. Baluchistan, of which a part, designated British Baluchistan, is a Chief Commissioner-ship under direct British administration, is wholly subject to its political control. Afghanistan, Nepal, and Bhutan are allied states within the sphere of British influence. In addition, the Indian Empire includes the island groups of the Andamans, Nicobars, and Laccadives, the settlement of Aden, with Perim, the Somali coast protectorate on the neighbouring African mainland, and protectorates over the island of Sokotra, along the southern coast of Arabia, and in the Persian Gulf.\n\nPhysical Aspect.\u2014The empire included within these boundaries is rich in varieties of scenery and climate, from the highest mountains in the world to vast river deltas raised only a few inches above the level of the sea, and consists of three separate and well-defined tracts.\n\nThe first of the three regions is the Himalaya Mountains and their offshoots to the southward. The Himalayas consist of a system of stupendous ranges, the loftiest in the world. They are the Emodus or Imaus of the Greek geographers, and extend in the shape of a scimitar, with its edge facing southwards, for a distance of 1,500 miles along the northern frontier of India. At the north-eastern angle of that frontier, the Dihang river, the connecting link between the Tsan-pu (Sangpu) of Tibet and the Brahmaputra of Assam, bursts through the main axis of the Himalayas. At the opposite, or north-western angle, the Indus in like manner pierces the range, and turns southwards on its course through the Punjab. The Himalayas, like the Kuen-luen chains, the Tien-shan, and the Hindu Kush, converge towards the Pamir tableland\u2014that central knot whence all the great mountain systems of central Asia radiate. The Himalayas have been divided into three principal chains; but regarded merely as a natural frontier separating India from the Tibetan plateau, they may be described as forming a double mountain wall running nearly east and west, with a trough or series of deep valleys beyond. The southernmost of the two walls rises steeply from the plains of India to 20,000 feet, or nearly four miles, in height. It culminates near its centre in\nKanchanjanga, 28,176 feet, and Mount Everest, 29,002 feet, the latter being the loftiest measured peak in the world. This outer or southern wall of the Himalayas subsides on the northward into a series of dips or uplands, 13,000 feet above the level of the sea, beyond which rises the second or inner range of Himalayan peaks. The double Himalayan wall thus formed then descends into a great trough or line of valleys, in which the Sutlej, the Indus, and the mighty Tsan-pu (Sangpu) gather their waters. The Sutlej and the Indus flow westwards, and pierce by separate passes through the western Himalayas into the Punjab. The Tsan-pu (or Sangpu), after a long unexplored course eastwards along the valley of the same name in Tibet, finds its way through the Dihang gorge of the Eastern Himalayas into Assam, where it takes its final name of the Brahmaputra. On the north of the river trough, beyond the double Himalayan wall, rise the Karakoram and Gangri mountains, which form the immediate escarpment of the Tibetan tableland. Behind the Gangris, on the north, the lake-studded plateau of Tibet spreads itself out at a height averaging 15,000 feet. Broadly speaking, the double Himalayan wall rests upon the low-lying plains of India, and descends into a river trough beyond which rises the Tibetan plateau. The higher ranges between Tibet and India are crowned with eternal snow, while vast glaciers, one of which is known to be 60 miles in length, slowly move their masses of ice downwards to the valleys.\n\nThis wild region is in many parts impenetrable to man, and nowhere yields a passage for a modern army. Ancient and well-known trade routes exist, by means of which merchandise from the Punjab finds its way over heights of 18,000 feet into Eastern Turkistan and Tibet. The Mustagh (Snowy Mount), the Karakoram (Black Mount), and the Chang-chenmo are the most famous of these passes.\n\nThe Himalayas, at both their eastern and western extremities, send out ranges to the southwards, which protect the north-eastern and north-western frontiers. On the north-east, those offshoots, under the name of the Naga and Patkoi Mountains, &c., form a barrier between the civilised British districts and the wild tribes of Upper Burma. The southern continuations of these ranges, known as the Yomas, are crossed by passes, the most historic of which, the Aeng or An, rises to 4,668 feet, with gradients of 472 feet to the mile.\n\nOn the opposite or north-western frontier of India, the mountainous offshoots run down the entire length of the British boundaries from the Himalayas to the sea. As they proceed southwards, their best marked ranges are in turn known as the Safed Koh, the Sulaiman, and the Hala Mountains. These massive barriers have peaks of great height, culminating in the Takht-i-Sulaiman, or Throne of Solomon, 11,317 feet above the level of the sea. But the mountain wall is pierced at the corner where it strikes southwards from the Himalayas by an opening through which the Indus river flows into India. An adjacent opening, the Khaibar Pass (rising to 3,400 feet), with the Kurram Pass to the south of it, the Gwaliari Pass near Dera Ismail Khan, the Tal Pass debouching near Dera Ghazi Khan, and the famous Bolan Pass (5,800 feet at top), still farther south, furnish the gateways between India and Afghanistan. The Hala, Brahui, and Pab Mountains form the southern hilly offshoots between India and Baluchistan, and have a much less elevation.\n\nThe Himalayas, while thus standing as a rampart around the northern frontier of India, collect and store up water for the tropical plains below. Throughout the summer, vast quantities of water are exhaled from the Indian Ocean. This moisture gathers into vapour, and is borne northward by the monsoon or regular wind, which sets in from the south in the month of June. The monsoon carries the masses of cloud northward across India, and thus forms the 'rainy season,' on which agriculture so critically depends. But large quantities of the moisture do not fall as rain in passing over the hot plains. This vast residue is eventually dashed against the Himalayas. Their lofty double walls stop its farther progress northwards; and it either descends in rain on their outer slopes, or is frozen into snow in its attempt to cross their inner heights. Very little gets beyond them; so that while their southern spurs receive the largest measured rainfall in the world, and pour it down to the Indian rivers, the great plateau of Tibet on the north of the double wall gets scarcely any rainfall.\n\nThis heavy rainfall of the Himalayas renders the southern slopes of that range very fertile, wherever there is any depth of tilth. But, on the other hand, the torrents scour away the surface soil, and leave most of the mountainsides bleak and bare. The upper ranges lie under eternal snow; the intermediate heights form arid grey masses; but on the gentler slopes, plateaux, and valleys, forests spring up, or give place to a rich though simple cultivation. The temperature falls about $34^\\circ$ F. for each thousand feet of elevation; and the vegetation of the Himalayas is divided into three well-marked zones, the tropical, the temperate, and the arctic, as the traveller ascends from the Indian plains. A damp belt of lowland, the tarai, stretches along their foot and is covered with dense, fever-breeding jungle, habitable only by rude tribes and wild beasts.\n\nThe wide plains watered by the Himalayan rivers form the second of the three regions above referred to. They extend from the Bay of Bengal on the east, to the Afghan frontier and the Arabian Sea on the west, and contain the richest and most densely-crowded provinces of the Empire. One set of invaders after another have, from pre-historic times, entered by the passes on the north-eastern and north-western frontiers. They followed the courses of the rivers, and pushed the earlier comers southwards before them towards the sea. About 165,000,000 of people now live on and around these river plains in the provinces known as the Lieutenant-Governorship of Bengal, Assam, the North-Western Provinces, Oudh, the Punjab, Sind, Rajputana and other native states.\n\nThe vast level tract which thus covers Northern India is watered by three distinct river-systems. One of these river-systems takes its rise in the hollow trough beyond the Himalayas, and issues through their western ranges as the Sutlej and Indus. The second also takes its rise beyond the double wall of the Himalayas, not very far from the sources of the Indus and the Sutlej. It turns, however, almost due east instead of west, enters India at the eastern extremity of the Himalayas and becomes\nthe Brahmaputra of Assam and Eastern Bengal. The third river-system receives the drainage of the southern Himalayan slope, and unites into the mighty stream of the Ganges, which flows south-eastwards into the Bay of Bengal.\n\nThe third division of India comprises the three-sided tableland which covers the southern half, or more strictly peninsular, portion of India. This tract, known in ancient times as the Deccan, literally the South, comprises the Central Provinces, Berar, Madras, Bombay, Mysore, with the native territories of the Nizam, Sindhia, Holkar, and other feudatory states. The Deccan, in its local acceptation, is restricted to the high tract between the Narbada and the Kistna rivers; but it is popularly understood to include the whole country south of the Vindhyas as far as Cape Comorin. It slopes up from the southern edge of the Gangetic plains. Three ranges of hills support its northern, its eastern, and its western sides, the two latter meeting at a sharp angle near Cape Comorin.\n\nThe northern side rests on confused ranges, running with a general direction of east to west, and known in the aggregate as the Vindhya mountains. The Vindhyas, however, are made up of several distinct hill systems. Two sacred peaks stand as outposts in the extreme east and west, with a succession of ranges stretching 800 miles between. At the western extremity, Mount Abu, famous for its exquisite Jain temples, rises, as a solitary outlier of the Aravalli Hills, 5,650 feet above the Rajputana plains, like an island out of the sea. On the extreme east, Mount Parasnath\u2014like Mount Abu on the extreme west, sacred to Jain rites\u2014rises to 4,400 feet above the level of the Gangetic plain. The various ranges of the Vindhyas, from 1,500 to over 4,000 feet high, form, as it were, the northern wall and buttresses which support the central tableland. Now pierced by road and railway, they stood in former times as a barrier of mountain and jungle between Northern and Southern India, and formed one of the main difficulties in welding the whole into an empire. They consist of vast masses of forests, ridges, and peaks, broken by cultivated valleys, and broad high-lying plains.\n\nThe other two sides of the elevated southern triangle are known as the Eastern and Western Ghats. These chains start southwards from the eastern and western extremities of the Vindhyas, and run along the eastern and western coasts of India. The Eastern Ghats stretch in fragmentary spurs and ranges down the Madras Presidency, receding inland and leaving broad, level tracts between their base and the coast. The Western Ghats form the great sea-wall of the Bombay Presidency, with only a narrow strip between them and the shore. The Eastern Ghats have an average elevation of 1,500 feet. The Western Ghats ascend more abruptly from the sea to an average height of about 3,000 feet, with peaks up to 4,700, along the Bombay coast; rising to 7,000 and even 8,760 feet in the upheaved angle where they unite with the Eastern Ghats, towards their southern extremity.\n\nThe inner triangular plateau thus enclosed lies from 1,000 to 3,000 feet above the level of the sea. But it is dotted with peaks and seamed with ranges exceeding 4,000 feet in height. Its best known hills are the Nilgiris (Blue Mountains), with the summer capital of Madras, Utakamand, 7,000 feet above the sea. Their highest point is Dodabetta peak, 8,760 feet, at the upheaved southern angle.\n\nOn the eastern side of India, the Ghats form a series of spurs and buttresses for the elevated inner plateau, rather than a continuous mountain wall. They are traversed by a number of broad and easy passages from the Madras coast. Through these openings, the rainfall of the southern half of the inner plateau reaches the sea. The drainage from the northern or Vindhyan edge of the three-sided tableland falls into the Ganges. The Narbada and Tapti carry the rainfall of the southern slopes of the Vindhyas and of the Satpura Hills, by two almost parallel lines, into the Gulf of Cambay. But from Surat, in lat. 21\u00b0 28', to Cape Comorin, in lat. 8\u00b0 4', no great river succeeds in piercing the Western Ghats, or in reaching the Bombay coast from the interior tableland. The Western Ghats form, in fact, a lofty unbroken barrier between the waters of the central plateau and the Indian Ocean. The drainage has, therefore, to make its way across India to the eastwards, now twisting sharply round projecting ranges, then tumbling down ravines, or rushing along valleys, until the rain which the Bombay sea-breeze has dropped upon the Western Ghats finally falls into the Bay of Bengal. In this way, the three great rivers of the Madras Presidency, viz., the Godavari, the Kistna, and the Kaveri, rise in the mountains overhanging the Bombay coast, and traverse the whole breadth of the central tableland before they reach the sea on the eastern shores of India.\n\nIt is on the three-sided tableland, and among the hilly spurs which project from it, that the mineral wealth of India lies hid. Coal-mining now forms a great industry on the north-eastern side of the tableland, in Bengal; and also in the Central Provinces. Beds of iron-ore and limestone have been worked in several places. Many districts are rich in building stone, marbles, and the easily worked laterite. Copper and other metals exist in small quantities. The diamonds of Golconda were long famous. Gold dust has from very ancient times been washed out of the river-beds; and quartz-crushing for gold is being attempted on scientific principles in Madras and Mysore.\n\nTo this vast empire, the English have added Burma, an account of which will be given further on.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The population of India, including Burma, but omitting French and Portuguese possessions and the frontier states of Baluchistan, Nepal, and Bhutan, amounted in 1891 to 287,223,431, or, as already mentioned, more than double the number which Gibbon estimated for the Roman empire in the height of its power. But the English government has respected the rights of native chiefs who are willing to govern well, and over one-third of the country still remains in the hands of its hereditary rulers. Their subjects make up 66,000,000, (exactly, 66,059,479) or something over one-fifth of the whole Indian people. The British territories, therefore, comprise only two-thirds of the area of India, and about four-fifths of its inhabitants.\n\nThe native princes govern their states with the help, and under the advice, of a Resident, whom the English Viceroy stations at their courts. Some of them reign almost as independent sovereigns; others require more assistance, or\na stricter control. They form a magnificent body of feudatory rulers, possessed of revenues and armies of their own. The more important exercise the power of life and death over their subjects; but the authority of each is limited by treaties or engagements, acknowledging their 'subordinate dependence' to the British government. That government, as suzerain in India, does not allow its feudatories to make war upon each other, or to form alliances with foreign states. It interferes when any chief misgoverns his people; rebukes, and, if needful, removes the oppressor; protects the weak; and firmly imposes peace upon all.\n\nThe British possessions are distributed into twelve governments, each with a separate head; but the whole is under the orders of the supreme government of India, consisting of the governor-general in council. The governor-general, who also bears the title of viceroy, holds his court and government at Calcutta in the cold weather, and during summer at Simla, 7,000 feet up the Himalaya mountains. The viceroy of India, and the governors of Madras and Bombay, are usually British statesmen appointed in England by the Queen. The heads of the other provinces are selected for their merit from the Anglo-indian services, and are nominated by the viceroy, subject, in the case of the lieutenant-governorships, to the approval of the Secretary of State.\n\nStatistics relating to the population of India, including the Native States, are given at page 338.\n\nBritish India supports a population more than twice as dense as that of the native states. If we exclude the outlying and lately-acquired provinces of Burma and Assam, the proportion is nearly threefold, or 279 persons to the square mile. How thick this population is, may be realised from the fact that France had, in 1891, only 186 people to the square mile; while even in crowded England, wherever the density approaches 200 to the square mile, it ceases to be a rural population, and has to live, to a greater or less extent, by manufactures, mining, or city industries. Throughout large areas of Bengal, two persons have to live on the proceeds of each cultivated acre, or 1,280 persons to each cultivated square mile. The Famine Commissioners reported in 1880, that over six millions of the peasant holdings of Bengal, or two-thirds of the whole, averaged from two to three acres a-piece. Allowing only four persons to the holding, for men, women, and children, this represents a population of twenty-four millions struggling to live off fifteen million acres, or a little over half an acre a-piece.\n\nUnlike England, India has few large towns, and no great manufacturing centres. Thus, in England and Wales, 53 per cent., or over one-half of the population in 1891, lived in towns with upwards of 20,000 inhabitants; while in British India only 4\u00b784 per cent., or not one-twentieth of the people, live in such towns. India, therefore, is almost entirely a rural country, and many of the so-called towns are mere groups of villages, in the midst of which the cattle are driven a-field, and ploughing and reaping go on. Calcutta itself has grown out of a cluster of hamlets on the banks of the Hugli; and the term 'municipality,' which in Europe is only applied to towns, often means in India a 'rural union,' or collection of homesteads for the purposes of local government.\n\nWe see, therefore, in India, a dense population of husbandmen. Wherever their numbers exceed one to the acre, or 640 to the square mile, excepting in suburban districts or in irrigated tracts, the struggle for existence becomes hard. In such districts, a good harvest yields just sufficient food for the people, and thousands of lives depend each autumn on a few inches more or less of rainfall. The Government may, by great efforts, feed the starving in time of actual famine; but it cannot stop the yearly work of disease and death among a steadily underfed people.\n\nIn some parts of India, therefore, there are more husbandmen than the land can feed; in other parts, however, vast tracts of fertile soil still await the cultivator. In England, the people would move freely from the over-populated districts to the thinly-inhabited ones; but in India the peasant clings to his hereditary homestead long after his family has outgrown his fields. If the Indian races will only learn to migrate to tracts where spare land still abounds, they will do more than the utmost efforts of Government can accomplish to prevent famines.\n\nThe facts disclosed by the census in 1881 and 1891 prove, indeed, that the Indian peasant has lost something of his old immobility. The general tendency of the population in Bengal is south and east to the newly-formed delta, and north-east to the thinly-peopled valleys or Assam. In 1891, it was ascertained that out of a specified population of 287,000,000, nearly 10,910,000, or about 4 per cent., were living in provinces in which they had not been born. But the clinging of the people to their old villages, in spite of hardship and famine, still forms a most difficult problem in India.\n\nThe following table compares the results of the census of 1881 with those of the census of 1891; but it refers only to the territory which was enumerated both in 1881 and 1891, so that Upper Burma, Kashmir, and a few smaller tracts are excluded from it.\n\n|                        | In 1881 | In 1891 | Increase | Percentage |\n|------------------------|---------|---------|----------|------------|\n| British Provinces      | 198,860,606 | 218,155,115 | 19,294,509 | 9\u00b776       |\n| Feudatory States       | 54,932,908  | 63,459,819  | 8,526,911  | 15\u00b752      |\n| French and Portuguese Possessions | 748,1783 | 844,307   | 95,524    | 12\u00b776      |\n| Total                  | 254,542,297 | 282,459,241 | 27,916,944 | 10\u00b797      |\nThe Ethnical History of India.\u2014European writers formerly divided the Indian population into two races\u2014the Hindus and the Muhammadans. But, when we look more closely at the people, we find that they consist of four well-marked elements. These are: first, the recognised non-Aryan tribes, sometimes called the Aborigines, and their half-Hinduized descendants; second, the comparatively pure offspring of the Aryan or Sanskrit-speaking race (the Brahmins and Rajputs); third, the great mixed population, generally known as the Hindus, which has grown out of the Aryan and non-Aryan elements (chiefly from the latter); and fourth, the Muhammadans. The same fourfold division applies to the population in feudatory India.\n\nOur earliest glimpses of India disclose two races struggling for the soil. The one was a fair-skinned people, which had lately entered by the north-western passes; a people of Aryan, literally \"noble,\" lineage, speaking a stately language, worshipping friendly and powerful gods. The other was a race of a lower type, who had long dwelt in the land, and whom the lordly new-comers drove back before them into the mountains, or reduced to servitude on the plains. The comparatively pure descendants of these two races are now nearly equal in numbers; the intermediate castes, sprung chiefly from the ruder stock, make up the mass of the present Indian population.\n\nGeology.\u2014For geological purposes, British India may be mapped out into the four geographical divisions of\u2014the Himalayan region, the Indo-Gangetic plain, Peninsular India, and Burma.\n\nThe Himalayan Region.\u2014The geology of this tract is more complex and less fully known than that of the peninsular area. The oldest rock of the Himalayas is a gneiss, differing in character from the gneiss of the Peninsula, and from that of Assam and Burma. The Himalayan gneiss is usually white and grey, its felspar orthoclase and albite; it contains much mica and mica schist, and is more uniform in character than the gneiss of the Peninsula. The latter is usually pink, its felspar being orthoclase and oligoclase; it contains little mica schist, but often has quartzite and hornblende rock. Hornblende occurs in the syenitic gneiss of the Northern Himalayan (or Ladakh) range.\n\nThe Central Himalayan region may be described as consisting of two gneissic axes, with a trough or synclinal valley between them, in which fossiliferous beds have been deposited and are now preserved.\n\nOn the south of this true Himalayan region, there is a band of country known as the Lower Himalaya, in which the beds are often greatly disturbed, and even completely inverted, over great areas, the old gneiss apparently overlying the sedimentary rocks. The Lower Himalayan range ends at the Sutlej valley, west of which the continuation of the central range is followed immediately by the third or sub-Himalayan range. This occurs almost always on the south of the Lower Himalayas, and is composed of later Tertiary rocks (Siwaliks, etc.), which range parallel with the main chain.\n\nThe Salt Range in the north-west of the Punjab has, in addition to its economic value, a special geological importance. Representatives of most of the great European formations of Silurian and later epochs are found in it; and throughout the vast length of time represented by these formations, there is here no direct evidence of any important break in succession, or unconformity. The lowest beds (salt marl, probably Silurian) and the highest (Siwaliks) are found throughout the range. But the others cannot be traced continuously throughout; some occur well-developed in one place, some in another. All the principal fossiliferous beds of the Jurassic, Triassic, and Carboniferous formations, are confined to the western part of the range.\n\nThe Indo-Gangetic Plain covers an area of about 300,000 square miles, and varies in width from 90 to nearly 300 miles. It rises very gradually from the sea at either end; the lowest point of the watershed between the Punjab rivers and the Ganges is about 924 feet above sea level. This point, by a line measured down the valley, but not following the winding of the river, is about 1,050 miles from the mouth of the Ganges, and 850 miles from the mouth of the Indus, so that the average inclination of the plain, from the central watershed to the sea, is only about one foot per mile; towards the sea-coast, the slope becomes almost imperceptible.\n\nThere is no evidence that the Indo-Gangetic plain existed as such in Pre-Tertiary times. The alluvial deposits made known by the boring at Calcutta prove a gradual depression of the area through the later Tertiary times. There are peat and forest beds, which must have grown quietly at the surface, alternating with deposits of gravel, sand, and clay. The Indo-Gangetic plain dates back to Eocene times; the origin of the Himalayas may be referred to the same period. Numerous minor disturbances occurred in the area which is now Northern India, during Palaeozoic and Secondary times; but the great disturbance which has resulted in the formation of the existing chain of the Himalayas took place after the deposition of the Eocene beds.\n\nPeninsular India.\u2014The oldest rocks here consist of gneiss, in three tracts:\u2014throughout a very large part of Bengal and Madras, extending to Ceylon; among the Aravalli ranges; and in Bundelkhand. Of these formations, the gneiss of Bundelkhand is known to be the oldest, because the oldest Transition rocks rest upon it; whereas the same Transition rocks are altered and intersected by granite dykes which proceed from the gneiss of the other tracts. The Transition rocks are of great but unknown age. The Vindhyan rocks which succeed them are of very old Palaeozoic age, perhaps Pre-Silurian. Yet, long before the earliest Vindhyan rocks were laid down, the Transition rocks had been altered and contorted. In more recent times there have been local disturbances, and large faults have in places been found; but the greater part of the Peninsular rocks are only slightly disturbed, and the most recent of the great and wide-spread earth movements of this region date back to Pre-Vindhyan times. The Vindhyan series are generally sharply marked off from older rocks, although in the Godavari valley there is no well-defined line between these and the Transition rocks.\n\nThe Gondwana series is in many respects the most interesting and important of the Indian Peninsula. The beds are almost entirely of\nfresh-water origin. The series is mainly confined to the area of country between the Narbada and the Son on the north, and the Krishna on the south; but the western part of this region is in great part covered by newer beds.\n\nThe Damodar series, the middle division of the Lower Gondwanas, is the chief source of coal in Peninsular India, yielding more of that mineral than all other formations taken together. The Karharbari group is the only other coal-bearing formation of any value. The Damodars are 8,400 feet thick in the Raniganj coal-field, and about 10,000 feet thick in the Satpura basin. They consist of three divisions; coal occurs in the upper and lower, ironstone (without coal) in the middle division. The Raniganj coal-field is the most important in India. So far as is yet known, it covers an area of about 500 square miles, running about 18 miles from north to south, and about 39 miles from east to west; but it extends farther to the east under the laterite and alluvium. It is traversed by the Damodar river, and also by the road from Calcutta to Benares, and by the East Indian Railway. From its situation and importance, this coal-field is better known than any other in India.\n\nThe upper, or Raniganj, series has eleven seams, with a total thickness of 120 feet, in the eastern district, and thirteen seams, 100 feet thick, in the western district. The lower, or Barakhar, series contains four seams, of a total thickness of 69 feet. Compared with English coals, those of this coal-field are of a poor quality; they contain much ash, and are generally non-coking. The best coal in India is in the small coal-field at Karharbari. The beds there are lower in the series than those of the Raniganj field; they belong to the upper part of the Talcher group, the lowest of the Gondwana series. The Karharbari coal-beds cover an area of about 11 square miles; and have three seams, varying from 9 to 33 feet thick. This coal-field, now largely worked, is the property of the East Indian Railway, which is thus supplied with fuel at a cheaper rate than any other railway in the world. Indian coal usually contains phosphoric acid, which greatly lessens its value for iron-smelting.\n\nThe Damodar series is also one of the most important sources of iron. The ore occurs in the middle division; coal in the highest and lowest. The ore is partly a clay ironstone, like that occurring in the coal-measures of England, partly an oxide of iron or haematite. It generally contains phosphorus, which prevents its use in the preparation of the finer qualities of steel.\n\nExcellent iron-ore occurs in the metamorphic rocks south of the Damodar river. Laterite is sometimes used as ore. It is very earthy, with a low percentage of metal; but it contains only a comparatively small proportion of phosphorus.\n\nThe want of limestone for flux, within easy reach, is generally a great drawback as regards iron-smelting in India. Kankar or glutin (concretionary carbonate of lime) is collected for this purpose from the river beds and alluvial deposits. It sometimes contains as much as 70 per cent. of carbonate of lime; but generally the proportion is much less, and the fluxing value proportionally diminished. The real difficulty in India is to find the ore, the fuel, and the flux, in sufficiently close proximity to yield a profit.\n\nThe enormous mass of basaltic rock, known as the Deccan trap, is of great importance in the geological structure of the Indian Peninsula. It now covers an area of about 200,000 square miles, and probably extended in former times over a much wider area. Where thickest, the traps are at least 6,000 feet in depth. They form the most striking physical features of the country, many of the most prominent hill ranges being the denuded edges of the basaltic flows. The great volcanic outbursts which produced this trap, commenced in the Cretaceous period, and lasted into the Eocene period.\n\nAs regards gems, the geologist comes to the same conclusion as the economist, viz., that the precious stones of ancient India were the product of forced labour, and that the search for them in our days can scarcely repay the working expenses.\n\nMeteorology.\u2014The great peninsula of India, with its lofty mountain ranges and its extensive seaboard, exposed to the first violence of the winds of two oceans, forms an exceptionally valuable and interesting field for the study of meteorological phenomena.\n\nFrom the gorge of the Indus to that of the Dihang (Brahmaputra), a distance of 1,400 miles, the Himalayas form an extensive watershed, the northern flank of which is drained by the upper valleys of these two rivers; while the Sutlej, starting from the southern foot of the Kailas peak, breaks through the watershed, dividing it into two very unequal portions, that to the northwest being the smaller. The average elevation of the higher Himalayas may be taken at not less than 19,000 feet, and therefore equal to the height of the lower half of the atmosphere; indeed, few of the passes are under 16,000 or 17,000 feet. Across this mountain barrier there appears to be a constant flow of air, more active in the day-time than at night, northwards to the arid plateau of Tibet. There is no reason to believe that any transfer of air takes place across the Himalayas in a southerly direction; unless, indeed, in those elevated regions of the atmosphere which lie beyond the sphere of observation. But a nocturnal flow of cooled air, from the southern slopes, is felt as a strong wind where the rivers debouch on the plains, more especially in the early morning hours. This current probably contributes to lower the mean temperature of the belt of the plains which fringes the mountain zone.\n\nThe Eastern Himalayas present many points of contrast with the western parts of the range. The slopes of the Sikkim and Bhutan Hills, where not denuded for the purposes of cultivation, are clothed with a dense impenetrable forest, which at the lower levels abounds in figs, rattans, and representatives of a tropical humid climate. At higher levels, they are covered with oaks, chestnuts, magnolias, pines, &c., of the most luxuriant growth.\n\nIn the Western Himalayas, on the other hand, the spurs of the outer ranges are more sparsely clad with forest, especially on their western faces; and naked precipitous crags are of constant occurrence. The vegetation of the lower and warmer valleys, and of the fringing belt (the Tarai), is comparatively thin, and such as characterises a warm but dry region. Pines of several species form a conspicuous feature of the landscape at lower levels. It is chiefly the outer ranges that exhibit these contrasted features; and they depend partly on the difference of latitude, but mainly on that of the rain-\nfall. In Sikkim and Bhutan, this is abnormally copious, and is discharged full on the face of the range. As the chain recedes to the north-west, the greater is the distance to be traversed by the vapour-bearing winds in reaching it, and the more easterly is their direction. For such winds, whether coming from the Bay of Bengal (apparently their principal source) or from the Arabian Sea, turn on reaching the Gangetic valley, and blow more or less parallel to its axis and that of the mountain range.\n\nThe country on either side of the Sulaiman range is characteristically arid. Dry winds from the desert tracts of Persia and Baluchistan predominate throughout the year. The scanty cultivation on the hills is dependent on the winter snows, or the rare showers which reach them from the eastward, or on the supply of the larger local streams. The lower plains would be uninhabitable but for the fertilizing irrigation furnished by the great river that traverses them.\n\nAt the foot of the great Himalayan barrier, and separating it from the more ancient land which now forms the highlands of the peninsula, a broad plain, for the most part alluvial, stretches from sea to sea. On the west, in the dry region, this is occupied partly by the alluvial deposits of the Indus and its tributaries, by the saline swamps of Kachchh (Cutch), by the rolling sands and rocky surface of the desert of Jaisalmer (Jey sulmire) and Bikaner, and partly by the more fertile tracts to the eastward. Over the greater part of this region, rain is of rare occurrence; and not infrequently more than a year passes by without a drop falling on the parched surface. On its eastern margin, however, in the neighbourhood of the Aravalli Hills, and again on the Northern Punjab, rain is more frequent, occurring both in the south-west monsoon, and also at the opposite season in the cold weather. As far north as Sirsa and Multan, the average rainfall does not much exceed 7 inches.\n\nThe alluvial plain of the Punjab passes into that of the Gangetic valley without visible interruption. Up or down this plain, at opposite seasons, sweep the monsoon winds, in a direction at right angles to that of their nominal course; and in this way the vapour brought by winds from the Bay of Bengal is discharged as snow and rain on the peaks and hill-sides of the Western Himalayas. Nearly the whole surface is under cultivation; and it ranks among the most productive\u2014as well as the most densely populated\u2014regions of the world. The rainfall diminishes from 100 inches at the south-east corner of the Gangetic delta, to less than 30 inches at Agra and Delhi; and there is an average difference of from 15 to 25 inches between the northern and southern borders of the plain.\n\nEastward from the Bengal delta, two alluvial plains stretch up between the hills that connect the Himalayan system with that of the Burmese peninsula. The first is that of Assam and the Brahmaputra, long and narrow, bordered on the north by the Himalayas, on the south by the lower plateau of the Garo, Khasi, and Naga Hills. The second, or Sylhet and Cachar valley, is chiefly occupied by swamps and jhils, and separates the Garo, Khasi, and Naga Hills from those of Tipperah and the Lushai country. The climate of both these plains is damp and equable, and the rainfall is prolonged and generally heavy, especially on the southern slopes of the hills. A meteorological peculiarity of some interest has been noticed, more especially at the stations of Sibsagar and Silchar, viz., the great range of the diurnal variation of barometric pressure, particularly during the cool months of the year. It is the more striking, since at Rurki, Lahore, and other stations near the foot of the Himalayas, this range is less than on the open plains.\n\nThe highlands of the peninsula are cut off from the Himalayan ranges by the Indo-Gangetic plain. They are divided into two unequal parts by an almost continuous chain of hills, loosely known as the Satpura range, running across the country from west-by-south to east-by-north, just south of the Tropic of Cancer. This chain may be regarded as a single feature, forming the principal watershed of the peninsula. The waters to the north of it drain chiefly into the Narbada (Nerbudda), and the Ganges; those to the south, into the Tapti, the Godavari, the Mahanadi, and smaller streams. In a meteorological point of view, this central chain of hills is of much importance. Acting together with the two parallel valleys of the Narbada and Tapti, which drain the flanks of its western half, it gives a more decided easterly and westerly direction to the winds of this part of India, and condenses a tolerably copious rainfall during the south-west monsoon.\n\nSeparated from this chain by the valley of the Narbada on the west, and that of the Son on the east, the plateau of Malwa and Baghelkhand occupies the space intervening between these valleys and the Gangetic plain. On the western edge of the plateau are the Aravalli Hills, which run from near Ahmedabad up to the neighbourhood of Delhi, and include one hill, Mount Abu, over 5,000 feet in height. This range exerts an important influence on the direction of the wind, and also on the rainfall. At Ajmere, an old-established meteorological station at the eastern foot of the range, the wind is predominantly south-west. Both here and at Mount Abu, the south-west monsoon rains are a regular phenomenon; which can hardly be said of the region of scanty and uncertain rainfall which extends from the western foot of the range, and merges into the Bikaner desert.\n\nThe peninsula south of the Satpura range consists chiefly of the triangular plateau of the Deccan, terminating abruptly on the west in the Sahyadri range (Western Ghats), and shelving to the east (Eastern Ghats). This plateau is swept by the south-west monsoon after it has surmounted the western barrier of the Ghats. The rainfall is consequently light at Poona, and places similarly situated under the lee of the range, and but moderate over the more easterly parts of the plateau. The rains, however, are prolonged to the north of the Satpuras three or four weeks later than in Southern India, since they are brought there by the easterly winds which blow from the Bay of Bengal in October, and the early part of November; when the recurved southerly wind ceases to blow up the Gangetic valley, and sets towards the Karnatic. This was formerly thought to be the north-east monsoon, and is still so spoken of by some writers; but the rainy wind is really a diversion of the south-west monsoon.\n\nAt the junction of the Eastern and Western Ghats rises the bold triangular plateau of the Nilgiris, and to the south of them come the\nAnamalais, Palnis (Pulneys), and Travancore Hills. These ranges are separated from the Nilgiris by a broad depression or pass known as the Palghat Gap, some 25 miles wide; the highest point of which is about 1,500 feet above the sea. This gap affords a passage to the winds, which elsewhere are barred by the hills of the Western Ghats. The country to the east of the gap receives the rainfall of the south-west monsoon; and, during the north-east monsoon, ships passing Beypur meet with a stronger wind from the land than is felt elsewhere on the Malabar coast. According to Captain Newbold, this gap 'affords an outlet to those furious storms from the eastward which sweep the Bay of Bengal, and, after traversing the peninsula, burst forth through it to the neighbouring sea.'\n\nIn the coast-strip of low country which fringes the Peninsula below the Ghats, the rainfall is heavy, the climate warm and damp, the vegetation dense and tropical. The steep slopes of the Ghats, where they have not been artificially cleared, are also thickly clothed with forest.\n\nIn Lower Burma, the western face of the Arakan Yoma Hills, like that of the Indian Western Ghats, is exposed to the full force of the south-western monsoon, and receives a very heavy rainfall. At Sandoway, this amounts to an annual mean of 212 inches. It diminishes to the northwards; but, even at Chittagong, it amounts to 104\u00bd inches annually.\n\nThe country around Ava, as well as the hill country of North Burma, is the seat of occasional severe earthquakes, one of which destroyed Ava city in 1839. The general meridional direction of the ranges and valleys determines the direction of the prevailing surface winds; subject, however, to many local modifications. But it would appear, from Dr. Anderson's observations of the movement of the upper clouds, that throughout the year there is, with but slight interruption, a steady upper current from the south-west, such as has been already noticed over the Himalayas. The rainfall in the lower part of the Irawadi valley, viz., the delta and the neighbouring part of the province of Pegu, is very heavy, about 190 inches; the climate is warm and equable at all seasons. But higher up the valley, and especially north of the Pegu frontier, the country is drier, and is characterised by a less luxuriant vegetation, and by a retarded and more scanty rainfall of about 56 inches.\n\n**British Administration of India.**\u2014The act of 1858, which transferred India from the company to the crown, also laid down the scheme of its government. Under the company, the governor-general had been an Indian autocrat, only responsible to the distant court of directors. The court of directors had, in its turn, been answerable to the shareholders, or court of proprietors, on the one hand; and, through the board of control, to the sovereign and to parliament on the other. The act of 1858 did away with these intermediary bodies between the governor-general and the British ministry. For the court of directors, the court of proprietors, and the board of control, it substituted a secretary of state, aided by a council appointed by the crown. The secretary of state is a cabinet minister, who comes into and goes out of office with the other members of the ministry. His council was originally appointed for life. They are now, with rare exceptions, appointed for ten years only, but may be re-appointed for another five years for special reasons. The secretary of state rules in all ordinary matters through the majority of his council. But in affairs of urgency, and in the questions which belong to the secret department, including political correspondence, he is not required to do so. The viceroy, or governor-general, is appointed by the crown, and resides in India. His ordinary tenure of office is five years.\n\nThe supreme authority in India is vested by a series of acts of parliament in the governor-general in council, subject to the control of the secretary of state in England. Every executive order, and every legislative statute, runs in the name of the 'governor-general in council'; but, in certain cases, power is reserved to the governor-general to act independently.\n\nThe governor-general's council is two-fold. First, the ordinary or executive council, usually composed of about five official members, besides the viceroy, and the commander-in-chief, which may be compared to the cabinet of a constitutional government. It meets regularly at short intervals, discusses and decides upon questions of foreign policy and domestic administration, and prepares measures for the legislative council. Its members divide among themselves the chief departments of state, such as those of foreign affairs, finance, war, public works, &c., while the viceroy combines in his own person the duties of constitutional sovereign and of prime minister.\n\nSecond, the legislative council, which is made up of the same members as the preceding, with the addition of the governor of the province in which it may be held, and certain officials selected by the governor-general from Bengal, Madras, and Bombay, together with nominated members representative of the non-official native and European communities. The official additional members must not exceed in number the non-officials; and the number of the nominated additional members must not be more than sixteen or less than ten. The meetings of the legislative council are held when and as required. They are open to the public; and a further guarantee for publicity is ensured by the proviso that draft bills must be published a certain number of times in the 'Gazette.' As a matter of practice, these draft bills have usually been first subjected to the criticism of the several provincial governments. Provincial legislative councils have also been appointed for the presidencies of Madras and Bombay, and for the lieutenant-governorships of Bengal and the North-Western Provinces with Oudh. The members of these local legislative councils are appointed in the case of Madras and Bombay by the governors of these Provinces; and in Bengal and the North-Western Provinces with Oudh by the lieutenant-governor subject to the approval of the viceroy. The Acts of these provincial councils, which can only deal with provincial matters, are subject to the sanction of the governor-general in council.\n\nThe presidencies of Madras and Bombay, and the lieutenant-governorships of Bengal and of the North-Western Provinces, have each a high court, supreme both in civil and criminal business, with an ultimate appeal to the judicial committee of the privy council in England. Of the minor provinces, the Punjab has a chief\ncourt, with five judges; Oudh, a chief court with two judges, styled the judicial and the assistant judicial commissioner; the Central Provinces and Upper Burma have each a judicial commissioner, who sits alone. Lower Burma has a judicial commissioner and a recorder. For Assam the high court of Calcutta is the highest judicial authority, except in three hill districts, in which the chief commissioner is judge without appeal.\n\nThe law administered in the Indian courts consists mainly of\u2014(1) the enactments of the Indian legislative councils (imperial and provincial), as above described, and of the bodies which preceded them; (2) statutes of the British Parliament which apply to India; (3) the Hindu and Muhammadan laws of inheritance, and their domestic law in causes affecting Hindus and Muhammadans; (4) the customary law affecting particular castes and races. Much has been done towards consolidating special sections of the Indian law; and in the Indian penal code, together with the codes of civil and criminal procedure, we have memorable examples of such efforts.\n\nBut, although the governor-general in council is theoretically supreme over every part of India alike, his actual authority is not everywhere exercised in the same direct manner. For ordinary purposes of administration, British India is partitioned into provinces, each with a government of its own; and certain of the native states are attached to those provinces with which they are most nearly connected geographically. These provinces, again, enjoy various degrees of independence. The two sister presidencies of Madras and Bombay still retain many marks of their original equality with Bengal. They are each administered by a governor appointed direct from England. They have each an executive and a legislative council, whose functions are analogous to those of the councils of the governor-general, although subject to his control. They thus possess a domestic legislature; and, in administrative matters, also, the interference of the viceroy is sparingly exercised.\n\nIn the other great provinces of India the governments are differently constituted. Bengal, the North-Western Provinces, and the Punjab are administered by lieutenant-governors. They must be chosen from officers in the service of the crown, who have served in India for at least ten years; they are appointed by the governor-general, with the approval of the crown, and, with one exception, they have always been members of the covenanted civil service. The lieutenant-governors have no councils for executive business, but the governor-general in council may establish for each province a council for legislative purposes only. This power was exercised in Lower Bengal in 1861, and in the North-Western Provinces in 1887. Their legislative councils are precisely similar to those in Madras and Bombay, the lieutenant-governor taking the place of the governor.\n\nThe governments of Burma, the Central Provinces, and Assam are administered by chief commissioners. Excepting in name and dignity, and in amount of salary and patronage, there is little difference between them and lieutenant-governors. Ajmere, transferred from Rajputana, British Baluchistan, Berar, or the districts assigned by the Nizam of Haidarabad for the support of the Haidarabad Contingent, and the little territory of Coorg in the extreme south, are quasi-provinces under the immediate control of the governor-general.\n\nAnother difference of administration, although now of less importance than in former times, derives its name from the old regulations, or uniform rules of law and practice which preceded the present system of acts of the legislature. These regulations have been from time to time withdrawn as regards certain tracts of country which, from their backward state of civilisation or other causes, seemed to require exceptional treatment. In non-regulation territory, broadly speaking, a larger measure of discretion is allowed to the officials, both in the collection of revenue, and in the administration of civil justice; strict rules of procedure yield to the local exigencies; and the judicial and executive departments are to a great extent combined in the same hands. Closely connected with this indulgence in favour of the personal element in administration, a wider field is also permitted for the selection of the administrative staff, which is not confined to the covenanted civil service, but includes military officers on the staff and also uncovenanted civilians. The title of the highest executive official in a district of a regulation province is that of collector-magistrate. In a non-regulation district, the corresponding officer is styled the deputy-commissioner; and the supreme authority in a non-regulation province, with the exception of the Punjab, is called, not a lieutenant-governor, but a chief commissioner. The Central Provinces, Assam, and Burma are examples of non-regulation provinces; but non-regulation districts are to be found also in Bengal, Sind, and the North-Western Provinces. Their character is always disclosed by the office of 'deputy commissioner.'\n\nAlike in regulation and in non-regulation territory, the unit of administration is the district\u2014a word of very definite meaning in official phraseology. The district officer, whether known as collector-magistrate or as deputy commissioner, is the responsible head of his jurisdiction. Upon his energy and personal character depends ultimately the efficiency of our Indian government. His own special duties are so numerous and so various as to bewilder the outsider; and the work of his subordinates, European and native, largely depends upon the stimulus of his personal example.\n\nAs the name of collector-magistrate implies, his main functions are two-fold. He is a fiscal officer, charged with the collection of the revenue from the land and other sources; he also is a civil and criminal judge, both of first instance and in appeal. But his title by no means exhausts his multifarious duties. He does in his smaller local sphere all that the home secretary superintends in England, and a great deal more; for he is the representative of a paternal, and not of a constitutional, government. Police, jails, education, municipalities, roads, sanitation, dispensaries, the local taxation and the imperial revenues of his district, are to him matters of daily concern. He is expected to make himself acquainted with every phase of the social life of the natives, and with each natural aspect of the country. He should be a lawyer, an accountant, a surveyor, and a ready writer of state papers. He ought also to possess\nno mean knowledge of agriculture, political economy, and engineering.\n\nThe total number of districts in British India is about 250. They vary greatly in size and number of inhabitants. The Madras districts are both the largest and the most populous. In every other province but Madras, the districts are grouped into larger areas, known as Divisions, each under the charge of a commissioner. But these divisions are not properly units of administration, as the districts are. They are aggregates of units, formed only for convenience of supervision, so that an intermediate authority may exercise the universal watchfulness which would be impossible for a distant lieutenant-governor.\n\nThe districts are again partitioned out into lesser tracts, called sub-districts, sub-divisions, talukas, or tahsils. The system of partitioning, and also the nomenclature, varies in the different provinces; but, generally, it may be said that the sub-division or tahsil is the ultimate basis of administration. Broadly speaking, the sub-division is characteristic of Lower Bengal, where revenue duties are in the background, and the tahsil or taluk of Madras, Bombay, and Northern India, where the land settlement requires attention year by year. There is usually no administrative unit below the sub-division or tahsil. The thana, or police division, only exists for police purposes. The pargana, or fiscal division under native rule, has now but an historical interest. The village still remains as the agricultural unit, and preserves its independence for revenue purposes in certain parts of the country. The niyok, or township, which corresponds very nearly to the subdivision, is peculiar to Burma.\n\nThe judicial jurisdictions coincide for the most part with the magisterial and fiscal boundaries. But, except in Madras, where the districts are large, a single civil and sessions judge, i.e., the chief judicial officer of the district, often exercises jurisdiction over more than one district. As has been already mentioned, in non-regulation territory, for the most part, the judicial and executive functions are combined in the hands of the deputy commissioner.\n\nThe preceding sketch of Indian administration would be incomplete without a reference to the secretariat, or central bureau of each province, which controls and gives unity to the whole. From the secretariat are issued the orders that regulate, or modify, the details of administration; into the secretariat come the multifarious reports from the local officers, to be there digested for future reference. The secretariat of the supreme government of India consists of seven branches, each of which deals with a special department of the administration. The officers who preside over them are named respectively, the foreign secretary, the home secretary, the secretary in the department of revenue and agriculture, the financial secretary, the military secretary, the public works secretary, and the secretary in the legislative department. In the presidencies, lieutenant-governorships, and chief commissionerships, the provincial secretariat is formed on the same model, but the secretaries are only from one to three or four in number.\n\nThe land furnishes the chief source of Indian revenue, and the assessment of the land-tax forms the main work of Indian administration.*\n\n* Statistics relating to the revenues and expenditure of the Government of India are given on pp. 340-1.\n\nThe gross land revenue of 1893-94 was Rx. 25,589,609, showing an increase of Rx. 684,281 on the totals of the preceding year. The average for the four years 1891-94 was Rx. 25,152,000. Lower Bengal, and a few adjoining districts of the North-Western Provinces and of Madras, have a permanent settlement, dating from 1793, by which the land revenue has been fixed in perpetuity, so no appreciable increase takes place under that head. Since the revenue was settled there has been a great increase in the area of cultivation, and in the value of the produce; but the amount of land revenue on these permanently-settled estates remains at the figure fixed a hundred years ago.\n\nThe land revenue on temporarily settled estates is fixed periodically at intervals of twelve to thirty years; the longer period being the more common. For estates held by proprietary brotherhoods or large proprietors the revenue is assessed on the cultivated area of a whole village or estate, averaging an area of about 800 acres, and no additional revenue is demandable on account of extensions of cultivation during the term of the settlement. Thus increases of revenue from such lands accrue only on the occasion of periodical revisions of the assessment; these revisions are called \"settlements.\" The revising officer takes into consideration the extensions of cultivation, the variation of prices, and the change in rents since the last settlement. On lands held by petty proprietors, that is, on rayatwari tenures, the State obtains yearly increases of revenue as cultivation extends; a settler usually enjoys his grant revenue-free for a few years where the cost of clearing the land is heavy. At periodical settlements on rayatwari lands the rates of revenue per acre are revised in some proportion to the change in prices since the previous settlement. At present the land revenue on temporarily settled lands represents something less than one-half of the actual or estimated rental, and is probably about one-tenth to one-twelfth of the gross value of the produce.\n\nSalt ranks next to the land revenue among the items of public income in India. Broadly speaking, the salt consumed in India is derived from four sources\u2014(1) Importation by sea, chiefly from the mines of Cheshire; (2) solar evaporation in shallow tanks along the seaboard; (3) gatherings from the salt lakes in Rajputana; (4) quarrying in the salt hills of the Northern Punjab. Until recently, the tax levied upon salt varied very much in different parts of the country; and a numerous preventive staff was stationed along a continuous barrier hedge, which almost cut the peninsula into two fiscal sections. The reforms of Lord Lytton's government in 1878, by which the higher rates were reduced and the lower rates raised, and their subsequent equalisation over the whole country, have effectually abolished this engine of oppression. Railway communication has much facilitated the trade in salt, and it has been found that prices are lowered by thus bringing the consumer nearer to his market, even though the rate of taxation be increased. In the Punjab and Rajputana salt administration has now become, as in Lower Bengal, a simple matter of weighing quantities, and levying a uniform tax. In Bombay, also, the manufacture is now conducted with a minimum of expense at the large central dep\u00f4ts in Gujarat and the\nKonkan, under a thorough system of excise supervision. Along the western coast, however, from Orissa to Cape Comorin, the process of evaporating sea-water is carried on as a private industry, partly on the government account and partly for large licensed dealers.\n\nLike the poppy cultivation in Bengal, the manufacture of salt in Madras is a monopoly, which can be defended by the circumstances of the case. No one is compelled to manufacture, and rights of property in a salt-pan are strictly respected; while the state endeavours, by means of a careful staff of supervisors, to obtain the maximum of profit with a minimum of interference. The system, as at present carried on, has been gradually developed from the experience of nearly a century. The manufacturers belong to the same class as ordinary cultivators; and, as a rule, their condition is somewhat more prosperous, for they possess a hereditary privilege with a commercial value. They do not work upon a system of advances, as is the case with so many other Indian industries; but they are paid at a certain rate when they bring their salt to the government depot, or to the licensed dealer.\n\nThe salt duty, which had for some years stood at Rs. 2 a maund of 82 lbs. for all India, and at 3 annas a maund for Burma, was raised on the 19th Jan., 1888, to Rs. 2\u00bd a maund in India, and to R. 1 (16 annas) in Burma. The alteration in the duty for the time checked consumption, which fell in 1888\u201389 below the average of the two previous years; but it has since recovered; thus\u2014\n\n| In the Year | Total Actual Consumption of duty-paid Salt in India, inclusive of Burma |\n|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1885\u201386    | 32,289,000 Maunds, each maund being equal to 34,330,000 lbs. avoirdupois. |\n| 1886\u201387    | 31,474,000 |\n| 1888\u201389    | 33,486,000 |\n| 1889\u201390    | 33,722,000 |\n| 1890\u201391    | 34,851,000 |\n| 1891\u201392    | 35,451,000 |\n| 1892\u201393    | 34,029,000 |\n\nThe local salt consumed in Burma is not precisely known, but in the foregoing figures is estimated from the best materials available.\n\nIn the year 1861 the net salt revenue was Rx. 4,400,000, with a duty ranging from Rs. 1\u00bd to Rs. 3\u00bd, and averaging Rs. 2\u00bd. In the year 1875 the net salt revenue was Rx. 5,737,000, with the same rates of duty, and in the year 1886\u201387 it was Rx. 6,141,000, with a uniform rate of Rs. 2 all over India, except Burma. In the year 1893\u201394, the net salt revenue was Rx. 7,754,471, with a uniform rate of Rs. 2\u00bd a maund, except in Burma, where the rate was R. 1 per maund.\n\nExcise duties in India are levied with the twofold object of raising revenue and restricting the use of intoxicants and narcotics. On imported spirits, wines, and beer, duties are levied at rates ranging from Rs. 6 per gallon on London proof spirits to one anna a gallon on beer. A limited number of licenses to deal in imported liquors, according to the requirements of each city or tract, are granted on payment of a yearly fee, or are sold by auction to the highest bidder. Spirit is distilled in India for local consumption from sugar, from the flower of the mhowa tree, from the sap of palm trees, and sometimes from grain. Over the greater part of India licensed distillers work under supervision and pay a still-head duty, according to alcoholic strength, on all liquor they make. In tracts where the population is sparse, a distiller obtains a license to work an out-still of limited size and capacity, on payment of monthly duty computed to cover the probable output of the still. Liquor shops are licensed at such places and in such numbers as the actual local demand may justify, and licenses to occupy and to sell liquor at such shops are usually sold to the highest bidder.\n\nLicensed retail dealers are bound to get their liquor from a licensed still, to refuse liquor to children and intoxicated persons, to sell for cash only, and to close at specified hours. The wishes of the residents are allowed full weight when license for a new shop is proposed, or the transfer of an old shop is intended. Licenses to open a shop, or a limited number of shops, for the sale of fermented toddy (palm tree sap), rice beer, and other fermented drinks, are usually sold by auction; and usually no distiller's or dealer's license runs for more than a year, unless it be renewed. Hill and forest tribes are allowed to brew fermented drinks for their own use without duty. Beer brewed after English fashion, chiefly for European customers, has to pay the same duty as imported beer.\n\nExcise duty on opium and other narcotic drugs is levied partly by charging a high price for the drug when delivered from public stores to licensed dealers, and partly by putting up to auction yearly licenses to keep retail shops. Narcotic drugs sold at licensed shops consist almost entirely of different preparations of opium and of ganja, or other kinds of hemp. Tobacco is grown in nearly every village, and is smoked by most men, and by very many women and children in India; it is subjected to no duty.\n\nThe incidence of the excise revenue varies greatly in the different provinces of India. In one province there are millions who take liquor; in another drinking is comparatively rare; while in a third indulgence in opium is very common. The higher Hindu castes and the Moslems, as a rule, abstain from liquor; about one quarter of the whole Indian excise revenue accrues in ten or a dozen great cities.\n\nThe total of the excise and customs revenues on liquors and drugs was Rx. 5,784,438 in 1893\u201394.\ncompared with Rx. 5,659,685 in 1892-93. This total gives an average of somewhat more than four annas a head on the whole population of British India, as the revenue charge on the drink and drugs consumed during the year.\n\nPublic Works.\u2014These are grouped under three general heads\u2014irrigation, buildings and roads, and railways.\n\nThe class of works dealt with under the first head may be roughly divided into canals and tanks, though these two kinds of works are frequently used in combination. The storage of water in tanks for the purpose of irrigation is very common in Southern India. The works are for the most part of native origin; but much has been done under the British government in repairing and improving old tanks, and in constructing new works in Madras, the Bombay Deccan, and in Ajmir-Merwara. Canal irrigation, in which the water is drawn directly from a river, has been practised on the largest scale and with the most successful results in the North Western Provinces, the Punjab, and the deltas of the large rivers in the Madras Presidency. Irrigation canals are of two descriptions, viz.: \"perennial\" and \"inundation.\" The former are furnished with permanent headworks and weirs, and are capable of irrigating large tracts of country throughout the year, independently of the local rainfall. The magnitude of some of the works of this class, which are almost entirely due to British enterprise and skill, may be judged by a few instances. The Ganges Canal, which has been in operation since 1854, and has cost Rx. 2,895,187, comprises 459 miles of main canal, and 3,819 miles of distributaries, and in 1893-94 supplied water to 656,757 acres. The Sirhind Canal in the Punjab, which has not long been opened, has cost Rx. 3,784,482, and consists of 542 miles of main channels, and 4,653 miles of distributaries. In Madras the great deltaic irrigation systems of the Godavari, Kistna, and Kaveri have respective lengths of main channel of 503, 329, and 844 miles, and together irrigate upwards of 2,000,000 acres. The inundation canals, which are peculiar to the Punjab and Sind, are of a much simpler and less costly description than the perennial canals. They are for the most part simply earthen channels, made without the expensive machinery of masonry, dams, and sluices, and are supplied with water by the annual rise in May of the Indus and its affluents. They constitute a very useful class of irrigation works, and in some cases have produced most successful financial results.\n\nThe works to which the preceding paragraph applies, in most cases take off from the larger rivers, which, even in times of drought, can be depended upon for an unfailing supply of water. There is, however, a large class of works, chiefly tanks, in which the supply of water is more or less dependent on the local rainfall, either directly or through the medium of the smaller rivers which dry up in hot seasons. There remains the method of irrigation more extensively used in India than any other, viz., that by wells, which, however, does not come directly within the scope of operations of the public works department.\n\nThe buildings and roads branch embraces all the operations of the department which are not classed under the special heads of railways and irrigation. It includes the extension and maintenance of the road system, the construction and repair of government buildings, and a large miscellaneous class of works of public improvement, including lighthouses, harbours, embankments, boat bridges, and ferries, and the water supply and sanitation of towns.\n\nThe three systems on which railways have been constructed and worked in India, are the guaranteed, the state, and the assisted, though each of these, again, admits of subdivision. The original great trunk lines of India are due to the guaranteed companies. The contract between them and the government was as follows:\u2014The government gave the land required, free of charge; it also guaranteed interest generally at the rate of 5 per cent. on the share capital raised with its consent, and a lower rate upon debenture capital. A general supervision of the working of the railway was also retained, and stores and troops were to be carried on favourable terms. If the net profits in any half year fell below the amount of guaranteed interest, the government made up the deficiency. If they exceeded this amount, the surplus was equally divided between the government and the company. Moreover, the government had the right of buying the undertaking at specified dates, on payment of the value of the stock calculated at its market price on the average of the three preceding years. In this way, the East Indian Railway was acquired in 1880, the Eastern Bengal Railway in 1884, the Sind, Punjab, and Delhi Company's lines in 1885-86, the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway at the end of 1888, and the South Indian Railway in 1890. In 1870, a new policy of railway development by the direct agency of the state was inaugurated; but in 1880-81 a return was made to the system of encouraging private enterprise by state assistance. Both agencies are now employed side by side. The experience gained of the working of the old guarantee system has, however, suggested various modifications in the relations between the state and the companies which have more recently been formed for the construction and working of railways, and the nature of the assistance granted now varies considerably. In some instances, of which the Bengal and North-Western Railway is the most important, lines have been constructed without any direct pecuniary assistance; in others a subsidy or limited guarantee has been granted. The agency of private companies has also been employed by the government both in the construction and working of state lines. In all cases, the government has the power of taking over the railway at specified periods on stated terms.\n\nOn the 31st December, 1894, there were 18,759 miles of open railway in India, of which 359 miles were opened during the previous 12 months; 2,129 miles more were under construction or sanctioned for commencement. The chief extensions of the year were on the East Coast, Godhra-Rutlam, Oudh and Rohilkund, East Indian, and Mayavaram-Mutupet lines. The total capital outlay on railways, up to the end of the year 1894, was Rx. 237,121,552, and the cost of the open lines averaged about Rx. 12,640 per mile. The gross earnings of all lines for the year 1894 were Rx. 25,347,099, or Rx. 1,326,058 more than in the previous year;\nworking expenses came to a little less than 47 per cent. of the gross earnings; and the net revenue yielded 5\u00b768 per cent., as against 5\u00b749 per cent. in the previous year, on the capital expenditure on the open lines.\n\nStatistics of the length of the different lines will be found on page 342.\n\nThe general results of the working of the various classes of railways up to 31st December, 1894, are given in the following table:\n\n### Railway Statistics, 1894\n\n|

improvement of seaports, the increase of the cultivated area, and the abolition of internal and external customs duties have caused a great expansion of the trade of India. The exchange of commodities between one province or one district and another has increased vastly, but we have no record of the internal trade of India before 1858. In that year the Court of Directors reported that the exports and imports of merchandise by sea from and into India were valued at 2\u00bd and 1\u00be millions sterling respectively, or 3\u00be millions for the total foreign trade. The corresponding totals for the year 1894-95 were about 10\u00be millions of exports and 70 millions worth of imports, or 17\u00be millions of total trade.\n\nIn all parts of the world a large and regularly expanding trade is rightly regarded as a sign of national prosperity. While India's external trade has gone on increasing, there has arisen within her borders a great cotton-spinning and weaving industry, which already competes favourably with European manufactures in Eastern markets; there has grown up a great and rapidly increasing production of Indian coal; at the same time, new and valuable agricultural staples have been naturalised in the country. The next generation may, perhaps, see iron-works and the production of metals prosecuted in India on a large scale.\n\nIn old times India was a self-contained country, where every tract, more or less, made its own clothes from its own cotton, produced its own iron and made its own tools, grew and consumed its own food. Yarn was spun, cloth was woven, iron was smelted, and tools were made on a small scale by individual workmen after rude methods. But even before 1858 the old order was changing, and the change has been still more rapid since.\n\nThe domestic industries of India, such as weaving and spinning, pottery, brass-work, iron-work, and art work of many kinds, continue to be practised after ancient methods all over the continent of India. But Indian fabrics and products, made on a small scale by workers at their homes, have for years past been giving way before the cheaper cotton yarn and fabrics, and the iron or steel products of British factories. Meanwhile without any protection, favour or advantage, other than is afforded by cheap Indian labour, and by the production of raw materials in India, an important manufacturing industry is growing up, and steam-power factories are at work, among which those for spinning and weaving cotton, for spinning and weaving jute, for making paper, for husking and cleaning rice, for sawing timber, and for brewing beer, are the most important. Steam power is also largely employed in factories on tea gardens and in indigo factories. There,\nwere at the end of the year 1894-95, 144 cotton mills at work, of which 100 were in the Bombay Presidency, and which represented a nominal capital of over Rx. 12,000,000. These cotton mills employed nearly 140,000 hands with their 34,116 looms and 3,710,925 spindles. The increase in the number of spindles has been nearly 5 per cent., and in the number of looms 16 per cent., compared with the totals of the preceding year. There has been also further progress in the jute industry; the twenty-six jute mills in Bengal with a nominal capital of about Rx.3,700,000, employed 72,000 hands on 9,635 looms, and 192,759 spindles. Besides these, the rice mills, for husking and cleaning rice, and saw mills, most of which were in Burma, employed a large number of hands. The produce of the paper mills was sufficient to meet local requirements and to leave a small surplus for exportation. There were a number of breweries at work, which produced, during 1894, over 6\u00bd million gallons of beer and porter; the principal customer for this malt liquor is the commissariat department, which bought 3,267,000 gallons, for the use of European soldiers.\n\nThe chief industry of India has always been agriculture, but it was not until about the year 1870 that the Indian government directed systematic attention to fostering and improving Indian agriculture. Since that time there has been established in every province of India a public department which collects and distributes early information concerning the crops, controls or advises upon model and experimental farms, introduces new agricultural appliances, tries new staples, and is organising schools for teaching the chemistry and science of agriculture. By these departments Indian students of good education have been sent to Europe to study at agricultural colleges. The indigenous field implements and methods have been found financially the best for agriculture of the kind prosecuted by the people, and it is chiefly in respect of the use of manures, of rotation of crops, of fodder-raising and storing, of new staples, and of such appliances as improved sugar-mills, that the example or teaching of the agricultural departments and their agents is likely to have useful effect. Something has been done towards introducing better breeds of cattle into some provinces, and great attention has been paid to the improvement of the local breeds of horses, ponies, and mules. At the present time more than 370 selected sires from Great Britain, from Arabia, and from good cross-breeds are being maintained by government in the chief horse-breeding districts, besides about 360 donkey stallions in the mule-breeding tracts.\n\nBefore 1857 the cultivation of tea, coffee, and jute had been begun, but the progress made was small, and these articles were not reckoned among the staple products or exports of India. Customs restrictions were withdrawn, and the acquisition of waste lands for such crops was facilitated, and now the tea industry has so far extended that in the year 1894-95 India exported over 129 million pounds of tea. In 1893, the amount of Indian tea imported into England was over 118 million pounds, as against 43\u00bd millions from China, and 76\u00bd millions from Ceylon.\n\nExclusive of government transactions, the seaborne foreign trade of India for the year 1894-95 stood in round numbers thus:\n\n| Exports:\u2014 | Rx. |\n|-----------|-----|\n| Indian merchandise | 103\u00bd millions |\n| Foreign merchandise, re-exported | 5 \" |\n| Treasure | 8\u00bd \" |\n| Total | 117 millions |\n\n| Imports:\u2014 | Rx. |\n|-----------|-----|\n| Merchandise | 70\u00bd millions |\n| Treasure | 9\u00bd \" |\n| Total | 79\u00bd millions |\n\nThe grand total of 196\u00bd millions was less than the corresponding total of the previous year by 6\u00bd millions; but this reaction was to be expected after the abnormally large total of 1893-94. The trade of 1894-95 was about 3 per cent. smaller than in 1893-94, but it was considerably larger than in 1892-93 and the preceding years.\n\nThe chief items of the exports in the last two years were:\n\n| | 1893-94. | 1894-95. |\n|---|---------|---------|\n| Cotton (raw) valued at | 13,297,000 | 8,703,000 |\n| Cotton yarn and goods | 6,243,000 | 7,149,000 |\n| Jute and jute goods | 11,966,000 | 14,787,000 |\n| Rice | 10,247,000 | 13,692,000 |\n| Seeds | 16,753,000 | 14,202,000 |\n| Opium | 8,019,000 | 9,065,000 |\n| Wheat | 5,194,000 | 2,565,000 |\n| Tea | 6,586,000 | 7,556,000 |\n| Hides and skins | 5,801,000 | 6,560,000 |\n| Indigo | 4,182,000 | 4,746,000 |\n\nExports in 1894-95 showed for the most part a substantial improvement in value over the preceding year. The following articles advanced in value by over 10 per cent.: lac, oils, wool, jute, tea, cotton yarn and cloth, indigo, spices, hides, opium, and timber; and there were also increases under the heads of coffee, grain, and dyes. On the other hand, there was a decline of 38 per cent. in sugar, 34 per cent. in raw cotton, 28 per cent. in raw silk, and 15 per cent. in seeds. In the case of the first and last of\nthese, the falling-off was mainly a return to normal limits after an unusually large export in 1893-94; whilst, as regards cotton, the smallness of the crops and the increased consumption of the mills left but a very small quantity available for export.\n\nThe chief items of the import trade were:\n\n|                      | 1893-94. | 1894-95. |\n|----------------------|----------|----------|\n| Cotton yarns and     |          |          |\n| goods ... valued at  | 32,377,000 | 32,674,000 |\n| Metals and Machinery,|          |          |\n| apart from railway   | 10,098,000 | 8,788,000 |\n| materials ... valued  |          |          |\n\nThe importations of coal and railway materials shewed a considerable increase in value, and there were also improvements under four other heads; but these were more than outweighed by substantial decreases in oils, silk, glass, woollen goods, metals, provisions, spices, &c. The last two years, however, have been quite abnormal, owing to the effect of speculation due to the re-imposition of import duties, and they furnish but little trustworthy data for estimating the growth of the trade.\n\nThe port of Bombay had a foreign trade, exclusive of treasure and government stores, valued at Rx. 63,000,000, while the Calcutta trade came to over Rx. 71,000,000. Of India's total trade, exclusive of treasure, 47.4 per cent. was with the United Kingdom; 8.6 per cent. with China; 5.3 per cent. with France; and 5.3 per cent. with Germany. The total shipping entered and cleared to foreign countries at Indian ports during 1894-95 was 8,256,000 tons, of which 82 per cent. was under the British flag.\n\nThe countries which have the largest land trade with India are:\n\n|                      | 1893-94. | 1894-95. |\n|----------------------|----------|----------|\n| Nepal, with exports  |          |          |\n| and imports of mer-  | 2,597,000 | 2,948,000 |\n| chandise valued at...|          |          |\n| Kashmir ,, ,, ,,      | 952,000  | 1,126,000 |\n| Kandahar ,, ,, ,,      | 664,000  | 609,000  |\n| Kabul ,, ,, ,, ,,      | 594,000  | 428,000  |\n| Shan States ,, ,, ,,   | 551,000  | 783,000  |\n\nThere was on the whole a total trans-frontier trade in merchandise of about Rx. 9,176,000, showing an increase of nearly 14 per cent. as compared with 1893-94.\n\n**Assets and Liabilities.**\n\nThe following is a statement of the Assets and Liabilities of the Government of India.

Its extreme length from north-east to south-west is about 950 miles; its extreme breadth about 450 miles. The area of the British districts is 141,189 square miles, with a population of 35,639,440 persons. The five native states in political dependence on Madras\u2014Travancore, Cochin, Pudukota, Banganapalli, and Sandhur\u2014have an additional area of 9,609 square miles, and 3,700,622 inhabitants; total area, 150,798 square miles; total population, 39,331,062. The seat of government is at the presidency town, Madras City.\n\nOn every side but the north, the Madras presidency is washed by the open sea. Along the east, or rather from south-west to north-east, extends the continuous coast-line of the Bay of Bengal, stretching for nearly 1,200 miles, from Cape Comorin to the Chilka Lake; the western coast is formed by the shore of the Indian Ocean, for about 540 miles. Off the south-east lies the British colony of Ceylon, separated by a shallow strait, across which runs the string of rocks and sandbanks known as 'Adam's Bridge.' The irregular northern boundary of Madras has been formed by accidents of history. On the extreme north-east is the Bengal province of Orissa; next come the wild highlands of the Central Provinces; then for a long stretch, the dominions of the Nizam of Haidusrabad, separated by the Kistna river, and its tributary, the Tungabhadra; lastly, on the north-west by west, the districts of Dharwar and North Kanara in the Bombay presidency. The independent state of Mysore, which occupies a large portion of the centre of the area thus defined, may be regarded, for geographical purposes, as a part of Madras. The Laccadive Islands also form, for administrative purposes, a part of the presidency, being attached to the districts of Malabar and South Kanara.\n\nWith regard to native states, the largest, Mysore, was from 1831 to 1881 under the direct administration of the government of India; but in the latter year it was handed back to its native prince. Of those subordinate to Madras, Travancore and Cochin represent ancient Hindu dynasties, preserved by British aid from falling under the Muhammadan yoke of Mysore. A joint rebellion was suppressed in 1808; and the history of both states has since been a continuous record of peace and commercial prosperity. Pudukota is the inheritance of a chieftain called Tondiman, who rendered valuable service to the British during their wars in the south. Banganapalli and Sandhur, two petty estates, lie in the centre of two British districts. The zamindaris of Jaipur (Jeypore) and Vizagapatam are not native states with independent jurisdiction, but large landed properties under British administration.\nBroadly speaking, the entire population of Madras may be described as belonging to the five linguistic offshoots of the great Dravidian stock dominant throughout Southern India. At an early period, before the dawn of history, these races appear to have accepted some form or other of the Brahmanical or Buddhist faiths. Many storms of conquest have since swept over the land, and a few colonies of Mughal and Marhatta origin are to be found here and there. But the indelible evidence of language proves that the ethnical character of the population has remained stable under all these influences; and that the Madras Hindu, Muhammedan, Jain, and Christian are of the same stock. Of the five Dravidian dialects, Telugu is spoken by nearly 10,000,000 persons, spread all over the eastern coast of Madras, throughout the Ceded Districts above the Ghats, and in one half of the Nizam's territory; Tamil, by 15,000,000 persons, occupying the whole of Southern India up to Mysore and the Ghats on the west, and the Ceded Districts on the north; Kanarese, by 9,000,000 persons, in the central districts surrounding Mysore, and in South Kanara; Malayalam, by about 5,000,000 persons, chiefly on the Malabar coast; and Tulu by about 500,000 persons, in a limited portion of South Kanara. For the rest, Uriya is the native tongue in the extreme north of Ganjam, bordering on Orissa; and various sub-dialects of Dravidian origin are used by the hill tribes of the Eastern Ghats, of whom the Kandhs may be taken as the type.\n\nMadras can scarcely be regarded as a naturally fertile country. Over the greater part of its area, artificial irrigation is impossible; and cultivation is entirely dependent upon the local rainfall, which rarely exceeds 45 inches in the year, and seems liable to fail both irregularly and at recurrent intervals. The soil may be roughly classified into three varieties\u2014(1) the well-known regar, or black cotton-soil, met with in isolated patches, or wide plains, all over the presidency; (2) red soil, deriving its colour from an admixture of the peroxide of iron, which is also very widely spread, and presents every degree of fertility and barrenness; and (3) grey soil. But the prospects of the cultivator are determined less by the character of the soil than by the facilities for irrigation. The Malabar coast is the only part where the natural rainfall, brought by the south-west monsoon, may be trusted both for its amount and its regularity. Other districts, such as Bellary, are also dependent upon this monsoon; but, in their case, the rain-clouds have spent themselves in passing over the barrier range of the Western Ghats, and cultivation becomes a matter of hazard. Over the greater part of the presidency, the rainy season is caused by the north-east monsoon, which usually breaks towards the end of September. The seed is sown in October, and the crop harvested in February. The fortunate deltas of the three great rivers\u2014the Godavari, Kistna, and Kaveri (Cauvery)\u2014are the only spots along the eastern coast which artificial irrigation is able to save from all risk of occasional scarcity.\n\nThe greater part of the soil of Madras is held by the cultivators direct from government, under the tenure known as rayatwari.\n\nThe earliest rayatwari settlement of which we have any knowledge in the Madras presidency, and which still survives in full operation, is that of the district of South Kanara, framed in the fourteenth century, and revised in the sixteenth by the Bednur government. It was based on an estimate or valuation of the annual out-turn of the rice land and plantations then under cultivation within the properties, great or small, held by the agricultural population of the district. Each owner\u2014and in the case of escheats to the state (sarkar-gweni), each tenant\u2014was brought into account (warg) with the revenue officers in respect to the fixed land-tax (kist) assessed on his cultivation each year; and the settlement survived, with many vicissitudes and arbitrary additions to the demand (shamilait), in remarkable completeness, all things considered, until the British rule supervened in 1799. The ancient rayatwari settlement was accepted and affirmed by the first settlement officer in the district, Major (afterwards Sir Thomas) Munro; and it is this form of rayatwari settlement for which he successfully contended, in preference to the proposed parcelling out of the district amongst farmers of revenue, who could not even look to waste or forest for the improvement of their income, both being included in the immemorial possessions of the ancient proprietary.\n\nThe ancient Hindu village system still underlies every form of our land administration in South India. The zamindar always treated his village communities as the units of rent and of revenue responsibilities, and almost invariably does so still. Where no such superior lord existed, or now exists, the village has always been, and is still, the unit of land revenue administration, and of rural social condition. It was so under the now obsolete village joint-rent settlement, which was the natural and prevailing form of revenue arrangement under the rulers who preceded the English, and, indeed, during the early years of our own rule. The abortive mutadari settlement consisted in parcelling out the undivided villages of the country into convenient farms for the collection of the revenue. The village is still the unit of administration under the more recent and Europeanized rayatwari, or individual settlement with the sharers in village lands.\n\nThe difference lies in this that, under the former system, the village community as a body was responsible for the apportionment of the lump demand amongst their cultivating members and sharers in the village lands; under the rayatwari settlement, the head of the village and village accountant keep accounts with each tenure-holder or cultivator within the limits of the village for the demand assessed on his individual holding, whether that demand be (as is still the case in districts not yet subjected to survey settlement operation), the old prescriptive demand, or the newly-determined claim under the survey settlement for thirty years. The rayatwari system of settlement has imparted more permanence to tenures. A separate fixed possession of land was inconsistent with the village joint-settlement. The demand to be paid by each sharer in the village lands is now fixed. But, on the other hand, this form of settlement, when extended to communities fully subject to the Hindu village organization, has traversed the spirit of that institution, and weakened, if not entirely relaxed, those ties of common interest, and of mutual support and liability, which were the bonds of Indian rural life. As respects the tenure of land under\na village *rayatwari* settlement,\u2014subject to the punctual discharge of the assessed rent-charge or demand on his holding, and sale of the land by public auction, free of all encumbrances, in case of legal default,\u2014the control of a village landholder under a *rayatwari* settlement over his property is complete, and indefeasible as respects the exercise of all proprietary right; such as sale, gift, inheritance, alienation, partition, voluntary relinquishment (including the responsibility for the revenue), and the like. He can only be ousted by government by sale for default, or under the land appropriation laws. The main difference between the condition of landholders under a *zamindari*, and a *rayatwari*, settlement, lies in the pledge held by the former against an increase in the fixed land revenue.\n\nThough the *rayatwari* system of settlement may be regarded as the characteristic feature of Madras, yet proprietary estates on the Bengal model are by no means rare in parts of the presidency. These estates conform generally to one of two types. They are either the remains of ancient principalities, which the holder cannot sell or encumber beyond his own life interest, the succession being hereditary in the eldest son; or, they are creations of British rule, dating from 1802, and subject to the usual Hindu rule of partition. The chief *zamindaris* of the first class are those of Parla Kimedi in Ganjam, Vizianagaram in Vizagapatam, Pittapur in Godavari, Venkatagiri in Nellore, Ramanad and Sivaganga in Madura. The total area of the *zamindari* estates of both classes is roughly estimated at 19,000,000 acres, or nearly one-fifth of the whole presidency. The *peshkash* or tribute payable to government amounts to about Rx. 500,000.\n\nIt was the immemorial practice of native governments, whether Hindu or Muhammadan, to alienate the land revenue either for religious endowments, or in favour of certain classes of privileged persons, or for services rendered to the state or local communities. The British government has in the main adopted the alternative policy of granting pensions in money for service rendered; but it has always scrupulously respected ancient land grants.\n\nMadras possesses few staple manufactures, apart from the village industries which supply the simple wants of the people. The preparation of the coffee-berry for export, scarcely a manufacture, was till lately the sole business carried on in the presidency by European capital, and under European supervision; with the exception of a little tea. Indigo, though largely manufactured in different parts of Madras, is of inferior quality. Repeated efforts have been made by English capitalists to introduce European methods of smelting iron in various parts of the presidency; but, hitherto, these attempts have been unsuccessful. The chief manufacturing industry of the presidency is weaving; but several cotton-mills and cotton-presses are now at work, and cigar-making and the manufacture of tiles and cement give employment to a considerable number of persons.\n\nThe Madras Railway, which connects at Raichor with the Great Indian Peninsula system, runs south-east to Madras, and then west across the peninsula to Calicut, with a branch to Bangalore. The South Indian Railway, on the narrow gauge, runs northward from Tuticorin to Madras, with branches to Tinnevelly, Negapatam, Erode, Pondicherry, Arkonam, and through Pakal to Nellore; in Mysore, a line connects the capital with Bangalore, and then runs north-west to join the Southern-Mahratta Railway at Harihar; while the main line of the latter stretches across the peninsula from the Mormugao frontier to Bezwada on the Kistna. On the east coast, the construction of an important line, which will link Bezwada with Cuttack and ultimately with Calcutta, is being rapidly proceeded with.\n\nThe continuous seaboard of the Madras presidency, without any natural harbours of the first rank, has tended to create a widely-diffused trade. Madras city, as by far the chief centre of population, and the eastern terminus of the railway system, conducts nearly one-half of the total seaborne commerce; next comes Malabar district, containing the western railway terminus near Calicut; then Godavari, with its cluster of ports along the fringe of the delta; Tinnevelly, with the new harbour at Tuticorin, which has opened large dealings with Ceylon; and then Tanjore, South Kanara, Ganjam, and Vizagapatam. As compared with the other presidencies, the trade of Madras is broadly marked by the larger proportion assigned to coasting trade with other Indian ports, and with Ceylon. The chief staples of the export trade are hides and skins, coffee and raw cotton.\n\nThe supreme executive authority is vested in the governor, with a council of two members, both of whom belong to the covenanted civil service. For legislative purposes, this council is increased by the presence of the advocate-general and from eight to twenty other members nominated by the governor, of whom not more than nine may be officials. The local administration is organised with the district or *zilla* as its unit. Of these districts there are 22 in all, including the Nilgiris and Madras city, both of which occupy an exceptional position. Each of the remaining districts is under the jurisdiction of a collector-magistrate, and a sessions judge. The collector-magistrate, as his name implies, combines the functions of a fiscal and a judicial officer. Beneath him come deputy-collectors, assistants, and sub-assistants. Each district is subdivided into *taluks* or *taluks*, under the charge of a *tahsildar*. Each *taluk* comprises about 270 villages, which constitute the ultimate units for fiscal and administrative purposes. The hereditary village officials, to be found in almost every Hindu village, have ever been utilized to perform minor public offices, revenue and judicial; being remunerated, either by fees in grain and other cesses levied from the villagers, or by a partial reduction in their land assessment. The heads of villages, and village accountants (*karnam*), collect and account for all revenue, rates, and taxes within their respective villages or townships.\n\nLocal and municipal administration, including roads and communications, schools and primary education, public health and local endowments, together with the special taxation levied for any of these purposes, is provided for by uniform legislation throughout the presidency. As respects population generally, entire districts or, where these are of unmanageable size, parts of districts, have been constituted local fund circles, each under the management of a board of\ncommissioners, which is usually a mixed body, consisting of official and non-official or representative members. To the local fund board so constituted, is entrusted the entire management of the above-named local interests, subject to the submission of their annual budget of income, and proposed expenditure, for the sanction of government; and of an annual report of the transactions of the board for the year, at its close. The government confides to the management of the local fund boards any assignments made from the provincial treasury towards the various local interests under their care. The sources of income at the disposal of these boards are the proceeds of a special land rate, not exceeding one anna per rupee of the government assessment on the land, tolls, school fees, local endowments, and other minor special and miscellaneous funds placed by government at their disposal.\n\nBOMBAY.\n\nThe Western Presidency of British India, comprising 24 British Districts and numerous Native States under the protection of Her Majesty's Indian Government. The territory thus composed extends from $28^\\circ 45'$ to $39^\\circ 53'$ N. lat., and from $66^\\circ 40'$ to $76^\\circ 30'$ E. long. The British districts, including Sind and the settlement of Aden, contain a total area of 125,144 square miles, and a total population of 18,901,123 souls; the native states, excluding Baroda, cover an additional area estimated at 69,045 square miles, with a population of 8,059,298 souls. The state of Baroda, with an estimated area of 8,226 square miles and a population reckoned at 2,415,396, from a geographical point of view, may still be regarded as forming part of Bombay, but it has been placed in direct subordination to the supreme government of India. The Portuguese possessions of Goa, Daman, and Diu, are also included within the geographical limits of this presidency. The capital of the province, the residence of the governor, and the head-quarters of all the administrative departments, is Bombay city, situated on an island of the same name, on the shore of the Arabian Sea, in $18^\\circ 55' 5''$ N. lat., and $72^\\circ 53' 55''$ E. long.\n\nBombay presidency is bounded on the north by Baluchistan and Khelat, the British province of the Punjab, and the native states of Rajputana; on the east, by the native states of the Central India Agency, the Central Provinces, West Berar, and the dominions of the Nizam of Hyderabad; on the south, by the presidency of Madras, and the state of Mysore; on the west by the Arabian Sea.\n\nThe territory included within Bombay presidency was, in old times, partitioned among many independent kingdoms. The most ancient records and memorials, such as the inscribed rock of Girnar and the caves of Ajanta, carry us back to the period before, and at the commencement of, the Christian era, when Buddhism was prevalent as the orthodox creed throughout the peninsula of India. This early faith is now represented by the Jains, who are still an influential sect in this part of the country, adhering with tenacity to their ancient traditions.\n\nThe country is deficient in mineral wealth, though abundantly supplied with stone adapted for building and road-making. At Teagar, in the district of Dharwar, iron ore is mined and smelted, but the scarcity of fuel prevents operations on an extensive scale. In the same district, large slate quarries are worked. There are five valuable limestone quarries near Karachi, and lime is burned in Belgaum district. The bordering mountains of Baluchistan are reported to contain large quantities of gypsum, copper, lead, antimony, and sulphur.\n\nThe classification into Marathi, Gujarathi, and Sindhi accurately enough represents the three principal nationalities of Western India, as determined by ethnical characteristics and a common history. The Marhattas have a distinct national individuality. They are an active, energetic race, liable to religious enthusiasm, and full of military ardour. In their native mountains of the Deccan, they never submitted to the Muhammadan yoke; and, under the leadership of Sivaji, they not only asserted their independence, but laid the greater part of India under tribute. The chief tribe is the agricultural Kanbis, a name identical with the Kurmis of Hindustan. The inhabitants of Gujarat include a somewhat larger Muhammadan element, owing to local conversions on a large scale, though the Hindus among them are characterised by a strong sectarian feeling which has taken shape in the popular development of the Vallabhachariya and Swami Narayan sects. The superior castes of Brahmans and Rajputs are numerously represented, and the mixed community of traders is more influential and numerous there than in most other parts of India. The chief tribes forming the mass of the Gujarath population are the Kanbi (or Kurmi) and Talabda Koli; while the aboriginal race is rapidly rising in the scale of civilisation. The people of Sind are almost all Muhammadans by religion, for their country was the earliest field of Musalman conquest in India; but their preservation of a dialect derived from the Sanskrit, though with a large infusion of Arabic and Persian words, indicates that they are descended from the early Hindu inhabitants of the province, who are said to have been converted in a body during the reign of the Beni-Umayyih Khalifs.\n\nThe wide extent, and the varied configuration of the Bombay presidency, permit great variations of agriculture. The two most important food crops are bajra or great millet (Sorghum vulgare), and joari or spiked millet (Holcus spicatus), which are especially cultivated in the Deccan. Rice is chiefly grown in the low lands of the Konkan. Wheat is extensively cultivated in parts of Gujarat, and in Sind, and barley is grown in the same localities to a smaller extent. The aboriginal tribes mainly support themselves on inferior cereals, such as nachani (Eleusine corocana), and kodra (Paspalum scrobiculatum), which they plant in patches of cultivation amid the primeval jungle that clothes the hillsides. The most important kinds of pulse are gram or chickpea (Cicer arietinum), tur (Cajanus indicus), kulthi (Dolichos biflorus), and mug (Phaseolus mungo). The oil-seeds are mustard, linseed (of which the fibres are not utilized as flax), castor-oil, til (Sesamum orientale), which yields the gingelly-oil of commerce, and kasumba or safflower (Carthamus tinctorius). Among fibres, cotton holds by far the chief place both in the Deccan and in Gujarat; ambari or Deccan hemp (Hibiscus cannabinus), and san or Konkani hemp (Crotalaria juncea), are also grown.\nmiscellaneous crops include tobacco, of which the finest quality is produced in Kaira district; sugar-cane, which requires a rich soil and a perennial water supply; potatoes, grown in the hill country near Poona; red pepper, turmeric, other spices, and indigo. It will be observed that this list leaves few staples available for export, besides cotton, oil-seeds, and wheat.\n\nThe revenue system of Bombay, based upon a cadastral survey of every cultivated field, allows the collection of elaborate agricultural statistics. Commencing from the village as the revenue unit, and rising through the talukas, or subdivisions, up to the district organisation, the minutest particulars affecting the administration of the land are carefully recorded year by year. The results, therefore, may be accepted as more trustworthy, at least for comparative purposes, than in most other parts of India.\n\nExcept in Sind, where the annual rainfall is insignificant, and the crops are entirely dependent upon artificial supplies of water drawn from the Indus by a network of canals, irrigation is not generally practised in the Bombay presidency. In bad seasons, every advantage is taken of the water that is available for use in river-beds, tanks, or wells; but there are no irrigation works constructed on a scale sufficiently large to give permanent benefit to wide areas of country. Within the last few years, some steps have been taken in this direction, but the broken character of the greater part of the country does not readily lend itself to such schemes.\n\nThe land revenue system of Bombay is based upon the principle of measuring every field separately, and assessing it at a sum fixed for a term of 30 years, the amount of assessment being determined by the quality of the soil and the crop. This plan was first introduced in 1836, in the case of the Indapur taluka of Poona district, and has since been gradually extended over the greater part of the presidency. It differs from the method adopted in the North-Western Provinces, in that the assessment is made direct with the individual cultivators, and not with the village community; and it differs from the rayatwari system of Madras, by not requiring a modification of the assessment every year. Prior to the introduction of the revenue survey, general anarchy prevailed, both with regard to the rights possessed by different parties in the soil, and also with regard to the proportion of the produce payable to government. There can be no doubt that the immediate result of the change was to improve the condition of the cultivator with marvellous rapidity. He has received a right of occupancy in his holding simply conditional on payment of the government demand. This right of occupancy, commonly known as 'the survey tenure,' has been described as 'a transferable and heritable property continuable without question at the expiration of a settlement lease, on the occupier's consenting to the revised rate.'\n\nSide by side with the survey tenure, there exist various forms of land-holding which have come down from the days of native rule, though none of them is now prevalent to a wide extent. Among these, the talukdari, wanta, narwadari, and maleki tenures in Gujarat deserve mention. In the districts of the Southern Konkan, the survey has not yet been introduced. The land is there held by a class of petty landlords called khots, whose rights, as against the government, have not yet been finally determined. The non-regulation province of Sind enjoys a land system of its own. The greater part of the land is cultivated by peasant proprietors. The rates of assessment depend upon the facility for irrigation from the Indus, and payment in cash has been substituted for the old practice of an actual division of the crop.\n\nApart from the new industry of cotton-spinning and weaving by means of steam machinery, the manufacture of cotton cloth in hand-looms is still conducted in almost every village throughout the presidency. A curious distinction in this respect separates the Gujarathi and Marathi-speaking races. The former prefer their cotton goods printed; while the latter only wear stuffs that have been dyed in the thread. The decoration generally consists of a simple border, but the more expensive articles are frequently finished off with silk, or with gold and silver lace. Sind weavers are reckoned the most skilful. The best saris, or women's robes, are printed at Ahmedabad and Surat. Even to the present day the majority of the population wear home-spun and home-woven goods; but, within the past few years, the twists and yarns produced in the Bombay mills have found great favour with native weavers. Carpets, rugs, horse-cloths, towels, napkins, &c., are manufactured in the jails throughout the presidency, especially in Sind, Ahmednagar is celebrated for its carpets, and Khandesh and Dharwar for drugged rugs and bullock-cloths. The raw material employed in manufactures of silk is imported from China. The chief seats of silk-weaving are Ahmedabad, Surat, Poona, Nasik, and Yeola. The two first of these places produce kinkhab, or brocades of silk and gold and silver thread, which are famous throughout India; the three last have a reputation for silk or cotton saris, finished off with rich borders of gold, silver, or silk lace, and beautifully filled with designs executed on the looms. The preparation of gold and silver thread is performed with great skill. It is said that one rupee's worth of silver can be drawn out into a thread 800 yards in length. The metallic thread is either twisted with silk before being used in the loom, or sometimes beaten out flat to form a warp by itself. The embroidery of various articles with gold and silver thread for the use of the Muhammadan and Parsi communities, or for the European market, is carried on at Haidarabad in Sind, in Kathiawar, and at Baroda, Surat, and Bombay. The manufacture of coarse paper from raw vegetable fibres is conducted in several of the large towns, especially at Ahmedabad and Baroda. Woollen manufactures are almost confined to the saddle-cloths, blankets, and felts of Sind. Among articles of leather-work may be mentioned the debaro, or large vessel used for holding oil, &c., which is formed by stretching a fresh skin round an inner mould of clay. Saddle-covers, shoes, leggings, and accoutrements are made in Sind, and the ancient manufacture of shields at Ahmedabad has not yet entirely died out. The common pottery of the presidency is of a very rude description, but Sind produces some of the best potters' ware of all India. Nasik and Poona are celebrated for their brass-ware. Bombay city and Ahmedabad also turn out large quantities of brass utensils, which have been hammered by native workmen out of sheets imported from...\nEurope. In the department of cutlery, spearheads are made at Ahmednagar, and hunting-knives, swords, and chain-armour in Cutch, Kathiawar, and Baroda. Ironwork, besides cutlery, is still hammered with great skill at Ahmedabad, where the beautiful gates of the tomb of Shah Alam afford an example of an extinct industry in perforated brasswork. Fine art is represented by a large number of ornamental articles manufactured in all parts of the presidency. The personal decorations of the women of Gujarat are distinguished by solidity, and those of Marathi women by intricacy of design. The Muhammadians and Parsis also have each styles of ornament peculiar to themselves. The goldsmiths' work of Sind is very beautiful. The embossed gold and silver work of the Cutch workmen is much sought after, and they have established a colony at Ahmedabad and Bombay. The former city and Surat are also celebrated for wood-carving. Most of the houses are ornamented in this way, and furniture and boxes are carved in ebony and black-wood. The best sandal-wood carving comes from Coomta (Kumpta), in Kanara. Sculpture has been practised by the stone-cutters of Cutch and Kathiawar from time immemorial. The more elaborate portions of the stonework on the recently erected public buildings in Bombay were executed by these workmen, trained in the school of art and the public works department.\n\nWithin the last twenty years, the spinning and weaving of cotton by steam-machinery, and under European supervision, has become an important industry.\n\nThe roads throughout the presidency are chiefly constructed and maintained out of local funds by the agency of the district officers. The two chief railways under the control of the Bombay government are the Great Indian Peninsula, with 1,287 miles open; and the Bombay, Baroda, and Central India, with 461 miles. Both of these are guaranteed railways of the standard gauge of 5 feet 6 inches; and in addition there are several minor branches. Both have their terminus in Bombay Island. The Bombay, Baroda, and Central India Railway runs due north along the coast to Palanpur; and the Southern Mahratta, the Dhond-Manmad chord of the Great Indian Peninsula, and the various lines in Kathiawar should also be mentioned.\n\nThe government of the presidency of Bombay is administered by a governor and his council, consisting of two members chosen from the covenanted civil service. The various departments of the administration are portioned out among the several members of council, and for each department there is a separate secretariat staff. In addition to, and inclusive of, this executive council, there is a legislative council, containing, in addition to the advocate-general, from eight to twenty persons nominated by the governor, of whom not more than nine may be officials. The district is the actual unit of administration for both fiscal and judicial purposes. The regulation districts of Bombay number 17, each under the control of a magistrate-collector, who must be a member of the covenanted civil service. The province of Sind, and the Panch-Mahals, form 7 non-regulation districts, under officers who may be either military, covenanted, or uncovenanted servants. The city of Bombay is regarded for many purposes as forming a district by itself. Each district is, on the average, divided into 10 talukas, or subdivisions; each of which again contains about 100 government villages, or villages of which the revenue has not been alienated by the state. Every village is, for fiscal and police, as well as social purposes, complete by itself. It has its regular complement of officials, who are usually hereditary, and are remunerated by grants of land held revenue free. The more important of these officials are the patel or headman; the talati or kulkarni, who is the clerk and accountant; the mihar, who is a kind of beadle; and the watchman. Over each taluka, or subdivision, is set a government officer termed a mamlaidar; and, on an average, about 3 talukas are placed in charge of an assistant or deputy collector. General supervision is exercised by revenue commissioners, three for the regulation districts and one for Sind. The supreme administration of justice in the regulation districts is entrusted to the high court, consisting of a chief justice and seven puisne judges, which exercises both original and appellate jurisdiction in civil and criminal cases. In Sind, the same functions are discharged by the judicial commissioner. The superior administration of both civil and criminal justice is vested in officials styled district and assistant district judges. Minor civil suits are decided by two classes of subordinate judges, and by the small cause courts; and the greater part of the original criminal work is disposed of by the executive district officers, who, in addition to their revenue duties, are entrusted with magisterial powers. The remaining principal departments of government are the police, public works, forests, education, jails, registration and medical departments; each of which possesses an organization extending throughout all the different districts of the presidency.\n\nPolitical relations between the government and the native states in connection with the Bombay presidency are maintained by the presence of an agent or representative at the principal native courts. The position and duties of the agent vary very considerably in the different states, being governed by the terms of the original treaties, or by recent sanads or patents. In some instances, as in Cutch, his power is confined to the giving of advice, and to the exercise of a general surveillance. In other cases, the agent is invested with an actual share in the administration; while states whose rulers are minors\u2014and the number of these is always large\u2014are directly managed by government officers. The characteristic feature of the Bombay native states is the excessive number of petty principalities, such as those of the Rajput and Bhil chieftains. The peninsula of Kathiawar alone contains no less than 187 separate states. The recognition of these innumerable jurisdictions is due to the circumstance, that the early Bombay administrators were induced to treat the de facto exercise of civil and criminal jurisdiction by a land-holder as carrying with it a quasi-sovereign status. The rule of succession by primogeniture applies only to the larger principalities, and, consequently, the minor states are continually suffering disintegration.\nBENGAL.\n\nBengal (or, as it is more precisely designated, 'Lower Bengal'), the largest and most populous of the twelve local governments of British India, comprising the lower valleys and deltas of the Ganges and Brahmaputra, lies between $19^\\circ 18'$ and $28^\\circ 15'$ N. lat., and between $82^\\circ$ and $97^\\circ$ E. long. Excluding Assam which was erected into a separate administration in February, 1874, Bengal now includes the four great provinces of Bengal Proper, Behar, Orissa, and Chhota or Chutia Nagpur. It forms a lieutenant-governorship with a population, according to the census of 1891, of 71,346,987 souls, and an area of 151,543 square miles.\n\nBengal is bounded on the north by Bhutan and Nepal; on the east, by Assam and Upper Burma; on the south, by the Bay of Bengal, Madras, and the Central Provinces; and on the west by the North-Western Provinces and by the plateau of the Central India Agency.\n\nThree of the provinces of the lieutenant-governorship of Bengal\u2014namely, Bengal Proper, Behar, and Orissa\u2014consist of great river valleys; the fourth, Chhota or Chutia Nagpur, is a mountainous region which separates them from the Central India plateau. Orissa embraces the rich deltas of the Mahanadi, and the neighbouring rivers, bounded by the Bay of Bengal on the south-east, and walled in on the north-west by Tributary Hill States. Proceeding eastward, the province of Bengal Proper stretches along the coast from Orissa to Burma, and inland from the seaboard to the Himalayas. Its southern portion is formed by the united deltas of the Ganges and Brahmaputra; its northern consists of the valleys of these great rivers and their tributaries. Behar lies on the north-west of Bengal Proper, and comprises the higher valley of the Ganges, from the spot where it issues from the territories of the lieutenant-governor of the North-Western Provinces. Between Behar and Orissa, but stretching farther westward, and deep into the hill country, lies the province of Chhota or Chutia Nagpur.\n\nThe territory thus hemmed in, except at its north-western angle, by the unchangeable landmarks of nature, consists chiefly of two broad river valleys. By the western one, the Ganges brings down the wealth and the accumulated waters of Northern India. The eastern valley forms the route by which the Brahmaputra, after draining the Thibetan plateau far to the north of the Himalayas, and skirting round their passes not far from the Yang-tse-Kiang, and the great river of Cambodia, ends its tortuous journey of 1,800 miles. These valleys, although for the most part luxuriant alluvial plains, are diversified by spurs and peaks thrown out from the great mountain systems which wall them in on the north-east and south-west. They produce tea, indigo, turmeric, the opium poppy, innumerable grains and pulses, pepper, ginger, betel-nut, quinine, and many costly spices and drugs, oil-seeds of various sorts, cotton, the silk mulberry, inexhaustible crops of jute, and other fibres; timber, from the feathery bamboo and coroneted palm to the iron-hearted sal tree. In short, every vegetable product which feeds and clothes a people and enables it to trade with foreign nations abounds. Nor is the country destitute of mineral wealth. The districts near the sea consist entirely of alluvial formations; and, indeed, it is stated that no substance so coarse as gravel occurs throughout the delta, or in the heart of the provinces within 300 miles of the river mouths. But, amid the hilly spurs and undulations on either side, coal, and iron and copper ores hold out a new future to Bengal, as capital increases under the influence of a stable government, and our knowledge of the country becomes more exact. The coal-fields on the west have for a century been worked by English enterprise, and now yield between one and a half million and two million tons per annum. In the east, the coal-measures of Assam, are being gradually developed with the opening-out of the country, and improved facilities of transport.\n\nThe climate varies from the snowy regions of the Himalayas to the tropical vapour-bath of the delta and the burning winds of Behar.\n\nThe most salient feature of Bengal is its rivers. These untaxed highways bring down, almost by the motive power of their own currents, the crops of Northern India to the seaboard,\u2014an annual harvest of wealth to the trading classes, for which the population of the Lower Provinces neither toil nor spin.\n\nThe government in Bengal is complicated by the fact that, while this vast population is ruled by a single head, it consists of elements so dissimilar as to render it impracticable to place them under any one system of administration. They exhibit every stage of human progress, and every type of human enlightenment and superstition, from the sceptical educated classes, represented by the Hindu gentleman who distinguishes himself at Oxford or a London Inn of Court, to the hill chieftain, who, a few years ago, sacrificed an idiot on the top of a mountain to obtain a favourable decision in a privy council appeal.\n\nThe whole territory subject to the lieutenant-governor of Bengal is portioned into nine large tracts, officially called divisions, each of which is superintended by a commissioner. Six districts of Bengal Proper, west of the Bhagirathi, or Hugli, constitute the Bardwan division and this tract is also known as Western Bengal; the Presidency, and the Rajshahi division and Kuch Behar divisions, are comprised in Central Bengal; Eastern Benga consists of the Dacca and Chittagong divisions; the province of Behar contains the Patna and Bhagalpur divisions; Orissa and Chutia Nagpur constitute each a separate division. These divisions are again divided into 47 districts, exclusive of Calcutta, and of the government estate of Banki.\n\nFor the purposes of revenue administration, the country was divided by the Mughal government into parganas, each comprising a certain number of villages with their lands. This arrangement formed the basis of our own revenue system; but, from its want of compactness, as well as for other reasons, it has been found inconvenient; and in Bengal has fallen into such decay that, in some districts, the pargana boundaries can hardly be ascertained. Practically the pargana divisions have died out, except for purposes of land revenue payments, in favour of the simpler and more compact arrangements adopted for purposes of police. The thana, or\npolice circle, is now the unit of local administration.\n\nThe Bengalis occupy Bengal Proper, with parts of Purniah, Santal Parganas and Maldah and Manbhum districts. They number about 38\u00bd millions. The people of Behar are Hindustanis, speaking the same language as, and in their manners, &c., almost identical with, the Hindustanis who inhabit the North-Western Provinces, Oudh, the Central Provinces, Rajputana, &c. A good many are resident in the Santal Parganas. Altogether, the Hindustani or Hindi-speaking people within the lieutenant-governorship of Bengal number a little over 26\u00bd millions. The Uriya speakers of Orissa, including hillmen and dwellers on the plains, are about 6 millions.\n\nThe large number of Muhammadans found in Lower Bengal was one of the most interesting of the facts brought out by the census of 1872; and both in 1881 and in 1891 this number was found to have largely increased.\n\nThe extraordinary absence of large towns is one of the most remarkable statistical features of Bengal. The population beyond Calcutta, and its suburbs, is almost wholly rural. Patna has a large population, and there are a few second-rate towns in Behar. In Bengal Proper, the largest town is Dacca (82,321). The city of Murshidabad, the seat of the Nawab Nazim and his followers, had in 1891 only 35,576 souls. Rangpur, the capital of the great district of Rangpur, contained 14,216 souls, and Jessore 8,495; these districts having a population of over 2,000,000 and 1,500,000 respectively. There were 191,671 villages with a population of less than 500 inhabitants; only 39 towns with a population above 20,000.\n\nThe villages in Bengal are isolated clusters of homesteads, whose inhabitants live very much among themselves, and cling tenaciously to their own homes. The old communal institutions by which the village was governed are fading away under the influence of British rule and the zamindari system. The ancient indigenous village system of India still exists in the hilly country attached to Bengal, but in the plains has almost disappeared. The traces that remain are scanty; in some places, village panchayats, or conferences, exist, but they are being supplanted by municipal institutions, law courts, and the influence of the landlord. The village headman has still, however, a recognised position in the rural community, although denuded of his authoritative powers. His functions are those of an arbitrator and general adviser; and the office is to a remarkable extent in the Bengal Delta hereditary in low-caste families.\n\nThe great staple crop of the province is rice, of which there are three harvests in the year,\u2014the boro, or spring rice; aus, or autumn rice; and aman, or winter rice. Of these, the last or winter rice is by far the most extensively cultivated, and forms the great harvest of the year. The aman crop is grown on low land. An indigenous description of rice, called uri or jadadhan, grows in certain marshy tracts.\n\nJute (pat or koshta) now forms a very important commercial staple of Bengal. The cultivation of this crop has rapidly increased of late years. Its principal seat of cultivation is Eastern Bengal, where the superior varieties are grown.\n\nIndigo cultivation is principally carried on with European capital. Notwithstanding the vicissitudes which it has encountered, it still forms one of the principal industries of the province. In the districts of Nadiya and Jessore, and throughout Central Bengal, in Purniah, and westwards in all Behar north of the Ganges, indigo is largely cultivated; and, from its mode of cultivation, it is in many places the staple which most engrosses the attention of the people.\n\nTea cultivation is the other great industry in Bengal carried on by European capital. It is produced in Darjiling and the Tarai.\n\nThe cultivation of opium is a state monopoly, no person being allowed to grow the poppy except on account of the government. The plant is successfully cultivated in the large Gangetic tract, which extends from the borders of Oudh to Agra on the west, and to the district of Bhagalpur on the east. The manufacture is carried on at two separate agencies,\u2014that of Benares, in the North-Western Provinces, of which the head station is at Ghazipur; and that of Behar, with its head station at Patna.\n\nThe cultivation of the cinchona plant in Bengal was introduced as an experiment about 1862, in a valley of the Himalayas in Darjiling district; and the enterprise has already attained great success.\n\nThe land revenue of Bengal and Behar is fixed under the permanent settlement, concluded by Lord Cornwallis in 1793. The government, by abdicating its position as exclusive possessor of the soil, and contenting itself with a permanent rent-charge on the land, freed itself from the labour and risks attendant upon a detailed local management. The land is held by zamindars, who pay their rent direct to government. In default of punctual payment of the revenue fixed upon the estates, these are liable to sale at public auction. The native zamindars in their turn have disposed of their zamindaris to under-tenants. The practice of granting under-tenures\u2014permanent and temporary\u2014has steadily increased, until at the present day only a small proportion of the whole permanently-settled area remains in the direct possession of the zamindars. This process of sub-infeudation has not terminated with the patnidars (permanent tenure-holders) and ijardars (lease-holders). Lower gradations of sub-tenures under them, called dar-patnis and dar-ijaras, and even lower subordinate tenures, have been created in great numbers. These tenures and under-tenures often comprise defined tracts of land; but a common practice has been to sub-let certain aliquot shares of the whole superior tenure; the consequence of which is that the tenants in any particular village of an estate often pay their rents to many different landlords,\u2014a fraction, calculated at the rate of so many annas or pice in the rupee, to each. All the under-tenures in Bengal have not, however, been created since the permanent settlement. Dependent taluks, gaulis, haolas (hawalas), and other similar fixed and transferable under-tenures existed before the settlement, and their permanent character was recognised at the time. In addition to these numerous tenures, the country is dotted with small plots of land held revenue free, the large majority of them having been granted by former governments, or zamindars under those governments, as religious endowments\u2014grants which have since been recognised and confirmed by the English government.\nThe management by the state of the landed properties of minors who are wards of government, or adults incapacitated for the management of their own affairs, is one of the many duties undertaken by the government. On an average, this management comprises about 140 estates, with a rental of about Rx. 900,000 per annum. The care of government extends also to the minors themselves, and arrangements are made by which they are properly cared for, and receive a good education suitable to their station.\n\nIn Bengal Proper and Behar the general settlement is permanent, but a fraction of the revenue is derived from lands under temporary settlement. These lands consist chiefly of alluvial accretions and government estates. Orissa, with the exception of a few large estates, is under a temporary settlement. In 1837, a thirty years' settlement was concluded, which, expiring in 1867, was renewed without alteration for another period of thirty years, and is, therefore, now in force.\n\nAll over Bengal there are the usual handicrafts, to supply local demand. Weaving and the manufacture of cotton thread occupy large numbers in every district; and, although the extensive imports of cloth and piece-goods from England are driving the finer native fabrics out of the market, the decline has been more than compensated for by the increase of general trade. If the demand for the exquisite muslins of Dacca has been destroyed, native industry is still able to find profitable employment in weaving cloth of a stronger texture from English spun and imported yarns. The growth of the jute trade has given an impetus to the manufacture of gunny-bags over all the Eastern and Central districts. The spinning and weaving of the fibre into cotton bales and grain and sugar bags, and its preparation in the raw state for exportation, afford occupation to thousands; and, in Calcutta and its neighbourhood, many mills are established, in working which the natives have displayed great aptitude. Carpenters, blacksmiths, goldsmiths, potters, and oil-sellers are settled in almost every village. The manufacture of beads, which are universally worn in necklaces by the lower orders of Hindus, is a very common occupation, and one in which the women take a large share. The weaving of wicker and basket work is the special occupation of the Dom class, a low caste. The native shoes are always made by the Muchis or Chamars. The sola weed grows with rice, and is manufactured by the gardener caste into the sola hats or topis worn by Europeans, and into artificial flowers and ornaments for native ceremonies. Among the important manufactures of Bengal calling for special notice are indigo, tea, silk, sugar and saltpetre. The two first have already been mentioned.\n\nThe production of silk has also long been an important industry. In the days of the East India Company, numerous large filatures, managed by the Company, did a very valuable trade. The ruins of some of these may still be met with, and on the sites of others are seen new filatures belonging to the firms which have succeeded to the trade. The industry, once so flourishing, has, however, for some time been in a declining state. The extensive importation of silk from Japan and China into Europe since the opening of the Suez Canal, and the abundant yield of recent seasons in Italy, have contributed mainly to this falling-off. But the quality of Bengal silk is also reported to be indifferent. The annual value of the silk produce of Bengal is from half a million to one and one-third of a million sterling.\n\nThe cultivation of the date-tree, and the manufacture of date sugar, are extensively carried on in Jessor, and in parts of Nadiya, the twenty-four Parganas, and Faridpur. It is a popular and profitable business for the cultivators.\n\nSaltpetre is refined in the northern districts of the Patna division in Behar. Like most branches of industry in India, its manufacture is based on a system of advances.\n\nThe most remarkable manufacturing feature of the present time, however, is the great development, in the neighbourhood of Calcutta, of large steam mills for the spinning and weaving of jute and gunny-bags, in establishments of a European character under European management.\n\nThe position of the classes engaged in trade and commerce in Bengal is very prosperous. The boat trade on the rivers is, for magnitude and variety, quite unique in India. Some of these country craft, with their strong gear and equipment, and their skilled navigators, face the winds, storms, and waves of the estuaries of the great rivers, and will, under sail, carry a heavy cargo against the current; others, again, can only ply in the sheltered creeks and channels which spread their network over the country. In Eastern Bengal, every husbandman keeps his boat, just as in other countries he keeps his cart.\n\nThe foreign trade of Bengal is brisk and flourishing. For many years past the exportation of raw produce has been exercising a progressive influence on the condition of the peasantry.\n\nThe Ganges, the Brahmaputra, and, on a much smaller scale, the Mahanadi in Orissa, with the Eastern Bengal Railway, and the great East Indian Line, form the main arteries of commerce. From these great channels, a network of minor streams, and a fairly adequate, although not yet complete, system of raised roads, radiate to the remotest districts.\n\nThe unit of the executive administration is the magistrate and collector, known as \"the District Officer.\" The superintendent of police is the right hand of the magistrate. The district jails, although placed in the hands of an officer, usually the civil surgeon, selected for the duty, are under the general control of the magistrate. A similar arrangement has been carried into effect in the department of education. All district officers are ex-officio registrars of deeds. The district officer is practically the executive chief and administrator of the tract of country committed to him. At his disposal are the subordinate magisterial police and revenue authorities. The subdivisional officers, who are assistant and deputy magistrates in charge of divisions of districts, exercise in their own jurisdiction the delegated authority of the district officer. The sub-deputies and the sub-divisional establishments are the agents of the superior executive officers. Above the district magistrates are the divisional commissioners. Their duties are to supervise the district officers, and to act as channels of communication between the local\nofficers and government, bringing together in a compact form the information they receive.\n\nThe management of the whole is firmly concentrated in a single man, the lieutenant-governor of Bengal, who is answerable to the government of India. His responsibility is divided by no executive council, as in Madras or Bombay. All orders issue through his secretaries in his own name; and although his policy is subject to the watchful control of the government of India, represented by the Viceroy, yet to the lieutenant-governor personally belongs the honour or disgrace of a successful or an inglorious administration. In making laws on matters relating specially to his province he is assisted by a legislative council of twenty members, composed partly of his principal officers, partly of leading members of the non-official European and native communities. In his legislative, as in his executive functions, a power of control, amounting if needful to veto rests with the government of India.\n\nBengal is divided into regulation districts, whose advanced state has rendered it expedient to place them under the complete system of Anglo-Indian law; and non-regulation districts, in which this has not yet been found practicable. The latter contain territories of three distinct classes. The first of them consists, for the most part, of newly-acquired territory, to which the general regulations have never been extended in their entirety. The second, of tracts inhabited by primitive races specially exempted from the operation of the regulations, and to whom a less formal code of law is better adapted. The third, of semi-independent or tributary states, administered or partly administered by British officers.\n\nCriminal justice is administered by the high court at Calcutta, the district courts of sessions, and the courts of magistrates. In respect of civil justice, the high court of Calcutta exercises original and appellate powers, together with an ecclesiastical, an admiralty, and a bankruptcy jurisdiction. Below the high court are the district and additional judges, the small cause court and subordinate judges, and the Munsifs, who are all civil judges.\n\nASSAM.\n\nThe province of Assam lies on the north-eastern border of Bengal, with Bhutan and Tibet beyond it on the north, and Burma and Manipur on the east. It comprises the valleys of the Brahmaputra and the Surma, together with the mountainous watershed which intervenes between these two rivers. It is situated between $24^\\circ 0'$ and $28^\\circ 17'$ N. lat., and between $89^\\circ 46'$ and $97^\\circ 5'$ E. long. The total area is estimated at 49,004 square miles, exclusive of the Lushai Hills and of the surface of the larger rivers; the total population, including the hill tracts, amounts to 5,476,833, according to the census of 1891. The administrative headquarters, and residence of the chief commissioner, are at the station of Shillong, in the Khasi Hills.\n\nAssam is bounded on the north by the eastern section of the great Himalayan range, the frontier tribes from west to east being successively Bhutias, Akas, Daflas, Miris, Abors, and Mishmis; on the north-east by the Mishmi Hills, which sweep round the head of the Brahmaputra valley; on the east by the unexplored mountains that mark the frontier of Burma, by the hills occupied by independent Naga tribes, and by the state of Manipur; on the south by the hills occupied by the Kukis or Lushais, by the state of Hill Tippera, and by the Bengal district of Tippera; on the west by the Bengal districts of Maimainsinh and Rangpur, the state of Kuch Behar, and Jalpaiguri district.\n\nThe province of Assam was constituted in the year 1874, when the eleven districts comprising it were separated from the lieutenant-governorship of Bengal, and erected into an independent administration under a chief commissioner. The tract thus united under one government is naturally divided into three portions,\u2014the Brahmaputra valley, the Surma valley, and the intervening hill tracts,\u2014each of which in former times possessed a separate history. To the Brahmaputra valley alone, covering an area of 20,869 square miles, or nearly one-half the whole, is the name of Assam properly applicable. This fertile valley, penetrated throughout its entire length by a great navigable river, has always been closely connected with the main course of Indian history; though it has never formed an integral part of the vast empires which dominated at various times over the rest of the peninsula. In ethnological features and in language, as well as in history, the population of Assam are distinct from the great body of Hindus, though in recent times they have adopted the Brahmanical religion. The earliest authentic traditions attest the existence of a Hindu kingdom of Kamrup, with its capital at Gauhati, still the most important town of the province. The area of this kingdom is said to have extended over a great part of Eastern Bengal, including the present district of Rangpur.\n\nThe three divisions of Assam are distinguished by well-marked physical features. Assam Proper, or the valley of the Brahmaputra, is an alluvial plain, about 450 miles long, with an average breadth of 50 miles. The Surma valley reproduces the same phenomena on a smaller scale. The district of Cachar is crossed by hill ranges running transversely to the main river; and, in Sylhet, the valley gradually expands until it merges into the wide expanse of Eastern Bengal. The central hill tract, comprising the districts of the Naga Hills, Khasi and Jaintia Hills and Garo Hills, forms a long, projecting outwork of the mountain system that intervenes between the watersheds of the Brahmaputra and the Irawadi.\n\nThe soil of the Brahmaputra valley is, for the most part, a rich, black loam, reposing on grey sandy clay, but in some tracts a light yellow clay appears on the surface. The mountains on the north and east are of igneous formation, being composed of primitive limestone, granite, serpentine, porphyry, and talcose slate. The hills of Assam abound in mineral resources, including coal, iron, and limestone.\n\nRegarded ethnically, the population of Assam presents a great variety of races. As compared\nwith Bengal, tribes of aboriginal or semi-aboriginal descent are especially numerous.\n\nThe population of Assam is entirely rural. All alike depend for their livelihood upon agriculture. Not a single town contains a large commercial or industrial element.\n\nThe one staple crop in all parts of Assam is rice. In the valley of the Brahmaputra, over 70 per cent. of the total cultivated area is devoted to the growth of that cereal. The other crops include mustard-seed in abundance, chiefly sown on marshy tracts, pulses to but a small extent, sugar-cane, Indian corn, betel-nut and betel-leaf, and tobacco. The cultivation of jute is confined to Sylhet and Goalpara districts, and that of cotton to the hill tracts. The soil of Assam is extremely fertile. Neither manure nor irrigation is required, as the rivers rarely fail to overflow their banks, and deposit a fresh top-dressing of silt every year. There is abundance of waste land on all sides waiting for tillage. The pressure of the population is at present very light. The revenue demand is comparatively low, and is levied in a manner most convenient to the cultivators.\n\nThe cultivation and manufacture of tea, conducted with European capital and under European supervision, forms the one great commercial industry of Assam. The tea-gardens occupy only a very small area, but they are the principal source of wealth to the province, and supply the chief stimulants to its development. India-rubber and lac are also valuable products; while timber from the extensive forests of the province is in considerable demand.\n\nThe principal native industry in Assam is the weaving of coarse silk cloth. Cotton cloth, brass-ware, pottery, ivory ornaments, and the ordinary utensils are also manufactured; but the indigenous manufactures of Assam have suffered greatly from the competition of the cheaper articles imported from Bengal. In Sylhet and the Surma Valley, there are specialties of sitalp\u0101ti or grass mats, shell bracelets, ivory mats and fans, and inlaid iron-ware.\n\nThe external commerce is almost entirely conducted by water, though a railway from Chittagong is now in course of construction. Both the Brahmaputra and Surma are navigable by steamers.\n\nThe administration of the province is entrusted to a chief commissioner, acting immediately under the orders of the government of India. Under him are the commissioner of the Assam Valley, and the political agent for Manipur State; next are eleven deputy-commissioners\u2014one for each district\u2014who conduct the various departments of the fiscal, executive, and, in some cases, judicial administrations. These posts are filled in accordance with what is known as the non-regulation system, being open to military officers and uncovenanted civilians, with the exception of Sylhet, which is reserved for a covenanted servant. There are two judges\u2014one for Assam Proper, and the other for the two districts of the Surma Valley. The heads of departments include an inspector-general of police, of jails, of registration, and superintendent of stamps, commissioners of excise, an inspector of schools, a conservator of forests, a superintending engineer of public works, &c.\n\nNORTH-WESTERN PROVINCES AND OUDH.\n\nLieutenant-governorship and chief-commissionership of British India, lying between 23\u00b0 52' and 31\u00b0 7' N. lat., and between 77\u00b0 5' and 84\u00b0 40' E. long. Area North-Western Provinces, 83,436 square miles; Oudh, 23,925 square miles; total, 107,361 square miles. Population in 1891, North-Western Provinces, 34,254,254 persons; Oudh, 12,650,831; total, 46,905,085. Including native states, these totals become 112,388 square miles, and 47,697,576 persons. The provinces are bounded on the north by the Chinese Empire; on the north-east by Nepal; on the east by Bengal; on the south by Chutia Nagpur, Rewah, the Bundelkhand states, and the Central Provinces; and on the west by Gwalior, Rajputana, and the Punjab.\n\nThe North-Western Provinces and Oudh occupy, roughly speaking, the upper basin of the Ganges and the Jumna, corresponding to Hindustan Proper of the Muhammadan chroniclers. A large semi-circular tract, comprising the valleys of the Gogra and the Gumti, has long been artificially separated from the remainder of the great plain, as the kingdom of Oudh; and though now under the administrative charge of the lieutenant-governor at Allahabad, it remains, in respect of its courts, a distinct chief commissionership. With this exception, the North-Western Provinces include the whole upper portion of the wide Gangetic basin, from the Himalayas and the Punjab plain to the Vindhyan plateau, and the low-lying rice fields of Behar. Taken as a whole, the lieutenant-governorship consists of the richest wheat-bearing country in India, irrigated both naturally by the rivers which take their rise in the northern mountains, and artificially by the magnificent system of canals and distributaries, which owe their origin to British enterprise. It contains many of the most famous cities of Indian history, and it is studded at the present day with thriving villages, interspersed at greater distances with commercial towns. Except during the hot-weather months, when the crops are off the fields, the general aspect is that of a verdant and well-tilled but very monotonous plain, only merging into hilly or mountainous country at the extreme edges of the basin on the south and north. The course of the great rivers marks the prevailing slope of the land, which falls away from the Himalayas, the Rajputana uplands, and the Vindhyan plateau south-eastwards towards the Bay of Bengal. The chief natural features of the provinces are thus determined by the main streams, whose alluvial deposits first formed the central portion of the North-Western Provinces; while the currents have afterwards cut for themselves deep channels through the detritus brought down by their own agency from the ring of hills or uplands on every quarter.\n\nThe great mass of the people are still Hindus, although the followers of Islam had long been established as the dominant race.\n\nMost of the people are gathered into small villages. There are, however, including Oudh, no fewer than 305 towns with a population exceed-\ning 5,000 souls; and 17 with a population exceeding 50,000. No other part of India contains so large a proportion of celebrated cities, though Delhi, the most famous of all, has been made over to the adjoining Punjab province.\n\nOut of a total area of 107,361 square miles, over 53,000 square miles are under cultivation. No part of India bears finer or more luxuriant crops than these provinces; and the natural fertility has been much increased by a magnificent series of irrigation works. The course of tillage comprises two principal harvests\u2014the kharif, or autumn crops, sown in June, and reaped in October or November; and the rabi, or spring crops, sown in October or November, and reaped in March or April. The great agricultural staple is wheat, but millets and rice are also largely cultivated. The chief commercial crops include indigo, cotton, sugar, opium, oil-seeds, and tea. Rice and sugar-cane grow chiefly in the river valleys, or in irrigated fields; wheat is raised on the uplands by the aid of canals and wells; millets and cotton grow on the drier soils, while tobacco, vegetables, and other richer crops occupy the manured plots in the neighbourhood of the villages. The system of land tenure is based upon the ancient Aryan communal type, with various modifications from the purest form of joint-village proprietorship down to the separate ownership of particular plots.\n\nThe cultivation and manufacture of tea is confined to the submontane districts of Kumaun, Garhwal, and Dehra Dun.\n\nThe export trade is chiefly confined to the raw produce of its agriculture. The principal staples include wheat, oil-seeds, raw cotton, indigo, sugar, molasses, timber, and forest produce, dye-stuffs, ghi, opium, and tobacco. The imports consist mainly of English piece-goods, metal-work, manufactured wares, salt, and European goods. The chief centres of trade are Cawnpore, Allahabad, Mirzapur, Benares, Meerut, Koil, Hathras, Muttra, Agra, Farrukhabad, Moradabad, Chandauli, Bareli, Saharanpur, Ghaziabad, Kasganj, Bijnaur, Nagina, Nabadab, Gorakhpur, Ghazipur, Pilibhit, and Shahjahanpur.\n\nThe principal manufactures are those of sugar, indigo, and coarse cotton cloth. Ornamental metal-work is made at Benares. Among the factories on the English model are the Elgin and Muir Cotton Mills of Cawnpore, the Shahjahanpur rum manufactory, and the breweries at Mussooree (Masuri) and Naini Tal. The provinces contain little or no mineral wealth, the quarries being almost entirely confined to the supply of building stone, and of nodulated limestone (kankar) for road metal.\n\nThe great water-ways of the Ganges and the Jumna formerly afforded the principal outlet for the overflowing produce of the provinces, and they still carry off a large portion of the heavy traffic. The Gogra forms the main channel for the grain and cotton of Gorakhpur, Basti, and Azamgarh, and for the forest products of Nepal. But a network of railways has, to a large extent, superseded the navigable rivers as a means of communication. The Ganges, Lower Ganges, and Eastern Jumna canals are also navigable throughout their whole course.\n\nThe North-Western Provinces and Oudh are under the administrative charge of a lieutenant-governor and chief-commissioner, who resides at Allahabad. He has a legislative council established on the model of the Madras, Bombay and Bengal councils, in 1886, and enlarged to 15 members under the Indian Councils Act of 1892. For the purposes of this council he is lieutenant-governor of the North-Western Provinces and Oudh.\n\nPUNJAB.\n\nProvince of British India, under the administration of a lieutenant-governor; lying between 27\u00b0 30' and 35\u00b0 2' N. lat., and between 69\u00b0 35' and 78\u00b0 35' E. long. Area under direct British administration, 110,667 square miles; population, according to the census of 1891, 20,866,847. The native states in dependence upon the lieutenant-governor of the Punjab have an estimated area of 38,299 square miles, with a population of 4,293,280 persons. The total area of the province, accordingly, amounts to 148,966 square miles, and its gross population (1891) to 25,130,127.\n\nThe Punjab is bounded on the north by Kashmir (Cashmere), and the hill states of Swat and Boner; on the east by the river Jumna (Jamuna), the North-Western Provinces, and the Chinese Empire; on the south, by Sind, the river Sutlej (Satlaj), and Rajputana; and on the west by Afghanistan and Khelat. The capital of the Punjab is Lahore, situated about the centre of the province, but the principal city in population and importance is Delhi, the ancient metropolis of the Mughal dynasty.\n\nIn its strict etymological sense, the Punjab, or region of the Five Rivers, comprises only the tract of country enclosed and watered by the confluent streams of the Sutlej (S:taaj), the Beas (Bias), the Ravi, the Chenab (Chinab), and the Jhelum (Jhilam). But modern territorial arrangements have included under the same designation three other well-demarcated tracts, namely\u2014the Sind Sagar Doab, or wedge of land between the Punjab Proper and the Indus; the Derajat, or narrow strip of country west of the Indus, and stretching up to the Sulaiman Mountains; and the cis-Sutlej Districts, or table-land of Sirhind, between the Punjab Proper and the Jumna (Jamuna), the greater part of which belongs, historically and physically, to the North-Western Provinces; though now transferred for administrative purposes to the lieutenant-governor at Lahore. The districts of Ludhiana, Umballa (Ambala), and Firozpur, were placed under the resident at Lahore after the first Sikh war (1845\u201346); those of Delhi, Gurgaon, Rohtak, Karnal, Sirsa, and Hissar, under the Punjab government after the Mutiny. The political relations of the Sikh states were placed under the Punjab government as soon as it was constituted, and those of the petty Muhammadan states of Pataudi, Loharu, and Dujana, after the close of the events of 1857. The province also includes the isolated Himalayan valleys of Kangra, Kulu, Lahul, and Spiti, and the glens of the Hazara frontier, among the outliers of the main Central Asia system, and the Hindu Kush.\n\nThe Punjab plain belongs naturally to the same wide and level table-land as the desert of Rajputana, and the thirsty province of Sind. Suffering like the rest of Northern India from a scanty and precarious rainfall, it would present a similar...\nexpanse of barren sand to that which stretches along its southern border, were it not for the fertilizing influence of the great rivers which take their rise among the snow-clad peaks of the Himalayas, and bring down a perennial supply of water during the driest seasons to the burnt and almost rainless country on either side.\n\nThroughout the Punjab, except upon the hills, wood is scarce. The uplands are generally covered only with grass, shrubs, or low jungle of mimosa. Clumps of trees, however, cluster around the village sites; and government has done much to encourage arboriculture, both by forest conservation, and by planting groves round cantonments and public buildings, or along roads and canals.\n\nIn 1866, a chief court, consisting of two judges\u2014a barrister, and a civilian\u2014was substituted for the judicial commissioner, and was constituted the final appellate authority in criminal and civil cases, with powers also of original criminal jurisdiction in cases where European British subjects are charged with serious offences, and of original civil jurisdiction in special cases. Since that date three other judges have been added to the court.\n\nAmong the Muhammadans, the Pathans are found chiefly in the north-western hill districts, where they form the bulk of the population. Of the Rajput Muhammadans, the Bhattis of the central divisions demand notice from their former dominant position; as do also the Ranghars of Delhi and Hissar, and the Janjhuas of Rawal Pindi. The Jats, who have embraced the faith of Islam where the Musalmans predominate, and elsewhere either retain their original creed or have become Sikhs, form the backbone of the cultivating community, except in the trans-Indus region. The Gujars are chiefly herdsmen on the dry central plateaux. The Ghakkars of Rawal Pindi compose the gentry of the hill country in that neighbourhood. A large number of Kashmiri immigrants are found as weavers in the larger towns.\n\nAmong the Hindus and Sikhs, Brahmins are usually found. The Rajputs inhabit the hills and plains east of the Ravi. The Banias compose the trading class in the eastern districts; but beyond the Ravi and in the southern divisions, the Aroras take their place. The Chamars comprise the lowest stratum of the population, only just emancipated from serfdom under British rule. The agricultural classes are returned, in the census of 1891, at about 10,667,500, exclusive of Pathans and Baloch, nearly 1\u00bd millions more.\n\nThe tillage of the Punjab extends mainly along the foot of the boundary mountains, and stretches in long strips by the side of the great arterial rivers. The agricultural year is divisible into the rabi or spring harvest, and the kharif or autumn harvest. For the former the principal crop is wheat. Next come barley and gram. Peas and other pulses cover a small area, and tobacco and vegetables are grown on garden-plots. Tea cultivation is followed with success chiefly in Kangra. The principal kharif crops are rice, millets, Indian corn, pulses, cotton, and sugar cane. The methods of agriculture still retain their primitive simplicity, scarcely differing from those in use during the Vedic period. Artificial irrigation is almost universal, except in the country immediately below the hills, and in the inundated tracts beside the great rivers. The Bari Doab, the Western Jumna, the Sirhind, and the Sutlej inundation canals supply water to a large area. Taking the province as a whole, it may be estimated that between one-fifth and one-sixth of the area is the property of government; while upwards of four-fifths belong to private owners. The greater part of the area belonging to government is, however, little better than an arid prairie, and could not profitably be brought under cultivation without the aid of extensive works of irrigation. Some of the more favourably-situated portions are preserved as forest or grazing lands, and others are held under lease from government for purposes of cultivation; but almost the entire cultivated area of the province is included in the lands of private owners.\n\nThese lands are held subject to the payment of land revenue to the state, or to grantees holding from the state; and their revenue at present exceeds Rx. 2,300,000 per annum, of which more than Rx. 300,000 are received by assignees who had, on various grounds, claims to consideration from government. In some cases, these assignments are of the nature of the release of the revenue of lands belonging to the assignees, but they have no necessary connection with proprietary right; and in the majority of instances, the grantees are merely entitled to receive the revenue payable to government, the amount of which is limited in the same way as if it were paid direct to government.\n\nThe great mass of the landed property in the Punjab is held by small proprietors, who cultivate their own land in whole or in part. The chief characteristic of the tenure generally is, that these proprietors are associated together in village communities, having to a greater or less extent joint interests.\n\nIn some cases, all the proprietors have an undivided interest in all the land belonging to the proprietary community,\u2014in other words, all the land is in common. It is, however, much more common for the proprietors to have their own separate holdings in the estate; and this separation may extend so far that there is no land susceptible of separate appropriation which is not the separate property of an individual or family.\n\nThe great centres of trade in the Punjab are Multan, Lahore, Amritsar, Ambala, Delhi, and Peshawar. The channels of traffic fall into four great divisions. That on the north frontier comprises the trade with Kashmir, Ladakh, Yarkand, Chinese Thibet, and Central Asia generally. That on the west frontier includes the trade with Kabul, Tirah, and Siwestan. By both these routes, the traffic inward consists of charas (an intoxicating preparation of Indian hemp), dyes of various kinds, goat's wool, raw silk, fruits and nuts, wood, furs and feathers, and shawl cloth; while indigo, grain, metals, salt, spices, tea, tobacco, Indian and European cotton cloth, hides and leather, form the chief items of return trade. As the Punjab is essentially an agricultural country, the exports consist chiefly of grain, cotton, salt, and other raw produce; while the imports comprise cloth, hardware, and other manufactured articles. The mineral wealth of the province is almost confined to its rich deposits of rock salt.\n\nThe railway system of the Punjab is a continuation of that which extends from Calcutta\ninto the North-Western Provinces, and it has now been put into direct connection with the sea at Karachi (Kurrachee) in Sind. The East Indian Railway sends a branch across the Jumna at Delhi, whence the Rajputana State Railway runs southward through Delhi and Gurgaon districts into Rajputana, ultimately extended to Bombay. The North-Western Railway continues the main system through the Gangetic Doab, crossing the Jumna into this province from Saharanpur district, and runs via Ambala, Ludhiana, Jalandhar, and Amritsar to Lahore; and thence continues the line as far as Peshawar on the north-west frontier; while another branch unites Lahore and Multan with Bahawalpur, Sukkur (Sakhar), and Karachi. A large part of the heavy traffic is conveyed by country boats on the Five Rivers, and thence by the Indus to the sea. Excellent metalled roads also connect the main centres of trade and the district headquarters.\n\nThe province is divided into 14 divisions; namely, Delhi, Ambala, Jalandhar, Hoshiarpur, Kulu, Ferozepore, Sialkot, Jhelum, Amritsar, Lahore, Rawal Pindi, Multan, the Derajat, and Peshawar.\n\nCENTRAL PROVINCES.\n\nThe name given to the territory under the administration of a chief commissioner, lying between 75\u00b0 50' and 24\u00b0 27' N. lat., and between 76\u00b0 and 85\u00b0 15' E. long., nearly coincident with the old geographical division of Gondwana. The tract falls naturally into several distinct areas, marked out by their physical features, and in a great measure by geological structure. To the north extends the Vindhyan table-land (including the districts of Sagar and Damoh), which sheds its waters northwards into the valley of the Ganges. Throughout this region, the surface is formed by the deposits styled Vindhyan, except in the large tracts where the Vindhyan strata are concealed by the overflowing volcanic rocks of the great Deccan trap area. South of Sagar and Damoh, in the valley of the Narbada, come Mandla (which includes the upper course of the river before it debouches into the plains) Jabalpur, Narsinghpur, Hoshangabad, and a part of Nimar, the rest of which lies in the valley of the Tapti. This area chiefly consists of alluvial and tertiary deposits, with a narrow belt of older rocks along the southern side of the valley. Continuing southwards, the next cluster of districts comprises Betul, Chhindwara, Seoni, and Balaghat, which occupy the extensive highlands constituting the Satpura table-land, in great part formed of the Deccan traps resting upon crystalline rocks, or upon sandstone and other rocks of later date. These districts at their central plateaux attain a height of about 2,000 feet. Still farther to the south extends the great Nagpur plain, formed by the valleys of the Wardha and Wainganga, which comprises the districts of Nagpur, Wardha, Bhandara, and Chanda. This region has no great elevation. It rests principally on gneissose and trap rocks, the former predominating in Nagpur and Bhandara, the latter in Wardha, eastwards. Below the ghats lies the Chhatisgarh plain, a low expanse of red soil, containing the districts of Raipur and Bilaspur. In this division is also included the district of Sambalpur, a rugged and jungly country, composed of crystalline and metamorphic rocks. Sambalpur is not, however, part of Chhatisgarh proper, either geographically or historically. It was originally attached to the south-western frontier agency of Bengal, and lies principally in the valley of the Mahanadi. Last of all, to the extreme south, almost cut off by forests and wild semi-independent states, is a strip of territory, of varied geological structure, stretching along the left bank of the Godavari, and attached to Chanda District.\n\nThe Central Provinces and the connected native states cover together an area of 115,936 square miles, of which little more than one-third is under cultivation. Yet the forests are not so important as might have been expected. The greater part of the waste land is covered by scrub jungle, and produces but little valuable timber.\n\nThe large coal-fields which extend under various parts of the Central Provinces, and the excellence of the iron ores, gave rise to expectations which at present seem unlikely to be realised. For the most part, on analysis, the coal has proved of inferior quality. It contains neither sufficient fixed carbon for iron smelting, nor combustible volatile gases to such an amount as to adapt it for generating steam. At present the only important colliery is that at Warora.\n\nThe Satpura plateau, stretching east and west for nearly 600 miles, with the wheat fields of the Narbada valley on the one hand, and the rice lands of the Nagpur plain on the other, forms the true barrier between northern and southern India. In this natural fastness, the so-called aboriginal tribes have found refuge, retreating on either side before the waves of Aryan immigration which swept forward from the Deccan and from Hindustan.\n\nThe principal agricultural products of the Central Provinces are rice, wheat, and other food grains. Cotton is grown chiefly in Nagpur, Wardha, and Nimar, and these districts, with Raipur and Bilaspur, have also the largest area under oil-seeds. The cultivation of tobacco is almost confined to Raipur.\n\nThe only important manufactures consist of weaving, and working iron ore. The tissue work of Burhanpur, and the richly-embroidered wearing apparel produced in parts of Nagpur and Bhandara, command an extensive sale beyond the province; and the excellence of the ores smelted near Gadarwara deserves notice. The internal trade is conducted by means of markets and fairs, the latter of which, for the most part, had a religious origin, and still retain a religious character. The chief external trade is with Bombay westward. The principal imports consist of cotton piece-goods, hardware, salt, cocoa-nuts, European liquors, tobacco, etc.; and the principal exports are raw cotton, grain, ghi, oil-seeds, and Indian piece-goods. Next in importance is the trade with the North-Western Provinces and Calcutta, the main imports being sugar from Mirzapur, piece-goods, indigo, jute bags, European liquors, etc.; and the exports, cotton for the mills at Cawnpore, lac, iron, grain, etc. With the Central Indian States a considerable traffic exists; but with the Nizam\u2019s dominions and Berar, and other parts of India, the trade is comparatively small. The Malwa opium, which passes through the province for\nexport to China, now goes through Nimar to Bombay by rail.\n\nThe want of good means of communication, especially important in a land-locked region, has greatly retarded the progress of the Central Provinces. After the rains, the larger rivers become navigable, but the rocky barriers which occur in their channels restrict the use of this mode of transit. The making of roads, which may be said to date from the establishment of the British power, is rendered difficult by the nature of the country. Nagpur forms the centre of the road system. From that city branch off\u2014the northern road, to Seoni and Jabalpur; the eastern line, by Bhandara and Raipur, to Sambalpur; the north-western, to Chhindwara; and the southern and south-western, to Chanda or Wardha. But besides these roads, numerous ancient tracks wind over hills and across the rocky beds of streams, along which the Banjaras drive their long trains of pack-bullocks. The Great Indian Peninsula Railway enters the Central Provinces near Burhanpur, and runs along the valley of the Nerbada, passing Hoshangabad, Narsinghpur, and Jabalpur, till it emerges from the north-east corner of the province, near Balihri. Starting from Bhusawal, a tributary line connects Wardha and Nagpur with the main railway, supplying communication with the coal-fields of Warora. A further branch has been constructed from Nagpur to Bilaspur, running thence east and north-east to join the East Indian Railway at Asansol; another line unites Bilaspur with Katni.\n\nNearly every form of land tenure found in India exists in the Central Provinces. Besides the estates of feudatory and of non-feudatory chiefs, known as zamindaris, the succession to which follows the law of primogeniture, what is termed the malguzari tenure prevails most widely. The estate, whether the property of one or many owners, is managed by a single proprietor, and the land is chiefly held by cultivators whose rents are thrown into a common stock. The profits are divided, or the losses made up, in proportion to the respective shares of the different proprietors.\n\nBURMA.\n\nThe eastern-most province of British India, under the administration of a chief commissioner; bounded on the north and north-east by China, and tribes subordinate to China; on the north-west by Bengal, Assam, and the feudatory state of Manipur; and on the west and south by the sea. To the south-east lies the kingdom of Siam. The total area, without the Shan States, is about 171,430 square miles, viz., Upper Burma, 82,473; Lower Burma, 87,957. The population of Lower Burma, according to the last census, was 4,658,627; that of Upper Burma was 2,945,923, giving a total for the province of 7,605,550.\n\nThe portion of Asia in which Burma is situated slopes from the central mountains towards the south; and the province is watered by five great streams, viz., the Irawadi and the Kyendwen, which unite their courses at 21\u00b0 50' N. lat., the Sittaung or Paun\u0433\u043b\u0430ung (Pounloung), the Salwin, and the Myit-nge. The first two rivers have their sources somewhere in the northern chain of mountains in the interior, one head stream of the Irawadi probably coming from Thibet; the Salwin has its source farther to the east in Thibet; the Sittaung in the hills to the south-east of Mandalay; and the Myit-nge, a large affluent of the Irawadi, drains the Shan States to the east of the capital. Except the last, which has a westerly direction, they all run in a southerly course to the Indian Ocean. The Irawadi and Salwin are large rivers, which, in the lower part of their course, overflow the flat country below their banks during the season of the rains, and higher up force their way through magnificent defiles. The former is navigable a considerable distance above Bhamo; but the latter is practically useless as a means of communication, owing to the frequent obstacles in its channel.\n\nThe northern portion of the province is, in the main, an upland territory, containing much rolling country, intersected by occasional hill ranges, and with a few isolated tracts of alluvial plain. Three chief ranges of hills traverse the southern portion from north to south, the Arakan Yoma, the Pegu Yoma, and the Paun\u0433\u043b\u0430ung, of which the Tenasserim Hills, forming the boundary between our territory and Siam, may be regarded as a prolongation.\n\nThe country throughout the Delta is flat and uninteresting. Towards Prome, the valley of the Irawadi contracts, and the monotony of the plain is diversified by a wooded range of hills. The Salwin valley contains occasional harmonies of forest, crag, and mountain stream; but they bear the same relation to the wild sublimity of the Himalayas as the Trossachs to the Alps. On the other hand, the scenery in Tavoy and Mergui, and among the myriad islets which fringe the Tenasserim coast, is almost English in its verdure and repose. The forests of Burma abound in fine trees. Among these, teak holds a conspicuous place, some of the finest teak forests being in Pegu. Almost every description of timber known in India is produced in the forests, from which also an abundant supply is obtained of the varnish employed by the Shans and the Burmese in their manufacture of lacquered ware. Sticklac of an excellent quality is obtained in the woods, and rubber of late years has been largely exported.\n\nBurma is rich in minerals. It produces gold, silver, copper, tin, lead, antimony, bismuth, amber, coal, petroleum, nitre, natron, salt, limestone, and marble, the jade or yu of the Chinese, sapphires, and other precious stones. Gold is found in small quantities at Shwe-gyin, in the sands of different rivers, and also towards the Shan territory on the eastern frontier; but the demand is very much greater than the native supply. There are silver mines near the Chinese frontier, but they have not been recently worked. The mountainous districts of the Shan territory contain almost all the other metals; but they are but scantily exported, and the copper and tin seen in Mandalay are mostly imported from China. Iron is found in several places, and is wrought especially at Poppa, near a mountain of that name to the eastward of the old capital Pagan, and also at Myedu, north-west of Mandalay; but, owing to ignorance and the want of proper methods, about 30 or 40 per cent. of the\nmetal is lost in the process. Large deposits of rich magnetic oxide, as yet untouched, exist in the ridges east of the capital near the banks of the navigable river Myit-ng\u00e9, and the same district contains lime in great abundance, and of remarkable whiteness; while statuary marble, equal to the best Italian kind, is found about 15 miles north of Mandalay to the east of the Irawadi. Mines of amber are wrought, among other places, at Hukhong or Payendwen, near the sources of Kyen-dwen. Nitre, natron, and salt are found in various quarters. Sulphur also occurs in some places, as in the district of Sale-myo, and in the neighbourhood of the petroleum wells; but the quantity is comparatively small. Coal has been discovered in various places. Petroleum is found in Kyaik-hpyu, the Boronga Islands, Thayet-myo, and Ye-nangyaung; and this industry is rapidly developing. The precious stones produced are chiefly the sapphire and the ruby. They are found about 60 or 70 miles in a northeast direction from Mandalay, over an area of about 100 square miles.\n\nIn Lower Burma, agriculture is the main employment of the people, and it may be assumed that the production and distribution of rice occupies three-fifths of the whole population. Cotton, sesamum, and tobacco are also extensively grown; gardens and orchards are found near every village; but rice covers about six-sevenths of the total area under cultivation. The enormous foreign demand, and the large profits recently obtained, have greatly increased the cultivation of the cereal. The Burmese are content with a single annual crop, corresponding with the aman ropa of Bengal. It is sown in June, transplanted in September, and reaped about December or January. Their soil is lavish in its yield, requires little labour, and no artificial stimulus beyond the ash of the past year's stubble, which is burned down and worked into the land. Year after year, without rest, the heavy rains and this primitive manure suffice to ensure an abundant harvest. The Irawadi valley and its delta furnish about three-fifths of the whole rice produce.\n\nUpper Burma, though inferior in point of fertility to the low-lying tracts of Lower Burma, is far from unproductive. The chief crops are rice (of which the Burmese count 102 different sorts), maize, millet, wheat, various pulses, tobacco, cotton, sesamum, mustard, and indigo. The sugar-cane appears to have been long known to the Burmese; but, though the climate and soil are extremely favourable, it is not generally cultivated. A cheap and coarse sugar is obtained from the juice of the Palmyra palm, which abounds in the tract south of Mandalay. The cocoa nut and areca palms are not common. The tea-plant, which is indigenous, is cultivated in the hills by some of the mountain tribes at the distance of about five days' journey, and by others in still greater perfection at the distance of about ten days' journey from Mandalay. It seems, however, to be another plant, probably the Elaeodendron persicum, which furnishes the principal ingredient in the hlapet, or pickled tea, that forms a favourite Burmese delicacy, and is an essential accompaniment to every social or ceremonial incident. Cotton is grown chiefly in the dry lands and climate of the upper districts. Indigo is indigenous, and is universally cultivated, but in a very rude manner; it is still more rudely manufactured, so as to be wholly unfit for exportation abroad.\n\nThe commercial prosperity of Lower Burma has more than kept pace with its rapidly-increasing population. Rangoon absorbs over 80 per cent. of the whole foreign trade of the province. The chief articles exported are rice, timber, cutch, hides, petroleum, and precious stones. The chief imports are piece-goods, silk, cotton and wool, cotton twist, gunny-bags, betel-nuts, liquors, tobacco, iron, mill machinery, and sugar.\n\nThe main commercial industries are those connected with the rice and timber trade. The indigenous manufactures of the country produce little beyond what is required for home consumption. Silk, lacquered ware, and gold and silver work, are among the most justly-admired of Burmese manufactures. The characteristics of Burmese art are vigour and novelty of design, but want of delicacy and finish in execution.\n\nOne of the most urgent wants of Burma is land communication. There is abundance of waterway, however, throughout the delta all the year round, but the Sittang valley has no such advantages. The railway to Mandalay from Toungoo (the then terminus of the Sittang Valley line), for which a preliminary survey was sanctioned in November, 1885, was opened for traffic in March, 1889. Since the railway was opened the districts through which it runs have been the quietest in Upper Burma. The traffic on the line is already considerable. Another line is now under construction which is to connect Mandalay with Mogoung, and the section between the former city and Wuntho has been already completed. Large outlay has been incurred and still continues upon barracks, hospitals, roads, and necessary civil buildings.\n\nNATIVE STATES.\n\nThat the territories of the Native States of India occupy no small proportion of the entire Indian peninsula and contain over one-fifth of the whole population of the country will be seen from the statistical table printed at page 338. The names of the principal chiefs, and the salutes allowed to each will be found at pp. 157-8.\n\nMany of the feudatory states are governed almost independently by their own rulers, but they are all subject in a greater or less degree to supervision and guidance at the hands of the British Government. They may be divided into two main heads: (1) states holding direct relations with the governor-general in council; and (2) states holding relations primarily with the several local governments of India.\n\nStates under the Direct Supervision of the Governor-General in Council.\n\n1. Haidarabad.\u2014The Haidarabad State is roughly co-extensive with the Deccan or central plateau of Southern India and takes its name from its capital city. With the exception of the assigned\ndistricts known as Berar, a tract of some 17,000 square miles, the whole of this province is governed by the Nizam. The total area, including Berar, is about 100,416 square miles, and the population is estimated to be 14,434,531, about one-tenth being Muhammadans. The ruling dynasty is of Turkoman origin, the name of the first sovereign being Chin Killich Khan, also known as Asaf Jah, who was appointed to be Viceroy of the Deccan with the title of Nizam-ul-Mulk in the year 1713. During the dissensions in the empire subsequent to the death of Aurungzeb, Asaf Jah succeeded in asserting his own independence. The Assigned Districts of Berar are administered by British officers in trust for the Nizam, and the government maintains out of their revenues an auxiliary force of four cavalry regiments, four field batteries of artillery, and six regiments of infantry. The raison d'\u00eatre of this force was primarily that it might be of use to the Nizam, but it is available also under treaty for general service with British troops when required. The surplus revenue derived from Berar, after paying for the cost of the administration, is paid to the Nizam's government, and now amounts to about eight lakhs of rupees per annum.\n\n2. Mysore.\u2014The Mysore State is situated in Southern India between 11\u00b0 40' and 15\u00b0 N. lat., and between 74\u00b0 40' and 78\u00b0 30' E. long., and is surrounded on all sides by British territory. Its total area is 27,936 square miles, and it contains a population of 4,943,604. The inhabitants are almost exclusively Hindus, who constitute more than 94 per cent. of the whole population. In early times Mysore was the principal seat of the Jains, who have left many interesting memorials of their occupation. The state has always been under Hindu rulers, except during the short interval caused by the usurpation of power during the 18th century by Haidar Ali and his son, Tipu Sultan. After the death of the latter, at the capture of Seringapatam in 1799, the English restored a representative of the ancient line in the person of Krishna Raj, son of Chama Raj of Arakotara. His subsequent misrule, when admitted to power on attaining his majority, led to the resumption of the administrative control of the province by the British government in the year 1831. The government, however, continued to be carried on in the name of the native prince, and at his death an adopted son was recognised as successor. This chief was duly installed on coming of age in 1881. The British chief commissioner thereupon handed over office to the native diwan, and a political resident was appointed to represent British interests.\n\n3. Baroda.\u2014This state includes all the territories of his Highness the Gaekwar. Its total area is 8,225 square miles, and it contains a population of 2,415,396 souls, the majority of whom (over 89 per cent.) are Hindus. The province of Gujarat was at one time included in the Mughal empire, but, in the early part of the seventeenth century, the Marhattas, under the leadership of Damaji Gaekwar, and afterwards of his son, Pilaji, succeeded in wresting all power out of the hands of the Mughal officers. From that time Baroda has remained continuously under the sway of the Gaekwar family, who held it in the first instance under the Mahratta Peshwa subject to a tributary payment, but afterwards threw off their allegiance and became feudatory to the British government under the guarantee of a treaty executed in the year 1817. The British government is represented at the court of the Baroda State by a political officer, called the governor-general's agent.\n\n4. Kashmir and Jammu.\u2014This native state includes, in addition to the district of Kashmir proper, Jammu, Punch, and the governorships of Ladakh and Gilgit. The area is estimated to be 80,900 square miles. The population, according to the census of 1891, amounts to 2,543,952. Kashmir became part of the Mughal empire in 1586 A.D., but it was afterwards subjugated both by the Afghans and the Sikhs. At the time of the Sikh war the state was under the government of Gulab Singh, a Sikh officer, who ruled as a feudatory of the Maharaja of the Punjab. After the victory of the British forces in 1846, the possession of the kingdom was confirmed to Gulab Singh, under certain specified conditions of alliance and subordinate co-operation, by a separate treaty executed at Amritsar in the same year. A political resident is permanently stationed in Kashmir state. The ruling family is Hindu, but the greater number of the inhabitants of the country, considerably more than half, are Muhammadans, and chiefly of the Sunni sect.\n\n5. Kalat.\u2014The Khan of Kalat is head of the Baluchistan tribal chiefs whose territories are comprised under the following divisions:\u2014Jhalawan, Sarawan, Makran, Las, and Kachh Gandava. These districts form what may be termed Kalati Baluchistan, and occupy an area of about 100,000 square miles. The inhabitants of the country are either Brahuis or Baluchis, both being Muhammadans of the Sunni sect. The country is sparsely populated, the total number being roughly estimated at 350,000 persons only. It derives its chief importance from its position with regard to Afghanistan on the north-western frontier of British India. The Khan of Kalat is under a treaty obligation of subordinate cooperation with the British government. The governor-general's agent in Baluchistan conducts the relations between the government of India and the Khan, and exercises a general political supervision over the district.\n\n6. Rajputana Agency.\u2014Rajputana is the name of a great territorial circle, situated between 23\u00b0 and 30\u00b0 N. lat., and between 69\u00b0 30' and 78\u00b0 15' E. long. Within these limits are twenty native states, having each its own autonomy and separate chief, together with the British district of Ajmere-Merwara. Of the Native States, 17 are Rajput, 2 are Jat (Bhartpur and Dholpur), and 1 only is Muhammadan (Tonk). Their combined area is about 130,000 square miles, and they contain a population of over 12 millions. The chief administrative control of the British district is vested ex officio in the political officer, who holds the post of governor-general's agent for the supervision of the relations between the several native states of Rajputana and the government of India.\n\nThe following table, compiled chiefly from the returns taken in 1891, gives a detailed statement of the estimated area and population (including forest tribes) and the approximate revenues of the states in the Rajputana Agency:\u2014\n### NATIVE STATES\n\n| Name                          | Area in square miles | Population | Approximate Revenue |\n|-------------------------------|---------------------|------------|---------------------|\n| Alwar                         | 3,951               | 767,786    | Rx.                 |\n| Banswara and Kushalgarh       | 1,937               | 212,289    | 26,000              |\n| Bhartpur                      | 1,961               | 640,303    | 271,000             |\n| Bikanir                       | 23,090              | 831,955    | 288,000             |\n| Bundi                         | 2,225               | 295,675    | 80,000              |\n| Dholpur                       | 1,156               | 279,890    | 125,000             |\n| Dungarpur                     | 1,440               | 165,400    | 20,000              |\n| Jaipur                        | 15,349              | 2,832,276  | 640,000             |\n| Jaisalmir                     | 16,039              | 115,701    | 22,000              |\n| Jhalawar                      | 3,043               | 343,601    | 150,000             |\n| Karauli                       | 1,229               | 156,587    | 45,000              |\n| Kishengarh                    | 874                 | 125,516    | 41,000              |\n| Kotah                         | 3,803               | 526,267    | 257,000             |\n| Lawa                          | 19                  | 3,360      | 500                 |\n| Marwar or Jodhpur             | 37,445              | 2,521,727  | 500,000             |\n| Meywar or Udaipur            | 12,361              | 1,862,478  | 375,000             |\n| Partabgarh                    | 959                 | 87,975     | 34,000              |\n| Shahpura                      | 406                 | 63,646     | 29,000              |\n| Sirohi                        | 1,966               | 188,977    | 30,000              |\n| Tonk (portion in Rajputana only) | 1,415          | 198,934    | 162,000             |\n\nTotal | 130,268 | 12,220,343 | 3,377,500 |\n\n---\n\n7. **Central India Agency.**\u2014Central India is the name given to the country occupied by the native states grouped together under the supervision of the political officer in charge of the Central India Agency. These states lie between 21\u00b0 24' and 26\u00b0 32' N. lat., and between 74\u00b0 0' and 83\u00b0 0' E. long. The British districts of Jhansi and Lalitpur divide the Agency into two main divisions\u2014Native Bundelkhand and Baghelkhand lying to the east, and Central India proper to the west. The total area covered is about 77,800 square miles, and the population amounts to 10,318,812. The great majority of the people are Hindus. The principal states are six in number\u2014Gwalior, Indore, Bhopal, Rewa, Dhar, and Jaora, of which two, Bhopal and Jaora, are Muhammadan, and the rest are Hindu. Besides these there are a multitude of petty states held by their rulers under the immediate guarantee of the British government, but having feudal relations with one or other of the larger states. The total number of states amounts to 69, and the petty chiefships to 79\u2014total, 148.\n\nThe list below gives the approximate size, population, and revenue of the six principal states above detailed:\n\n| Name | Area Sq. m. | Population | Approximate Revenue |\n|------|-------------|------------|---------------------|\n| Gwalior | 29,046 | 3,366,496 | Rx. 1,436,000 |\n| Indore | 8,402 | 1,094,150 | 650,000 |\n| Bhopal | 6,874 | 952,486 | 270,000 |\n| Rewa | 10,083 | 1,508,943 | 170,000 |\n| Dhar | 1,740 | 169,474 | 80,000 |\n| Jaora | 581 | 117,650 | 95,000 |\n\n---\n\nStates under the Local Governments and Administrations.\n\n1. **Under the Government of Madras.**\u2014The Madras Presidency includes five native states covering an area of 9,609 square miles, with a population of 3,700,622 souls. Approximate revenue, Rx. 1,000,000.\n\nOf these states, Travancore and Cochin represent ancient Hindu dynasties. Pudukattai is the inheritance of a chieftain called Tondiman. Banganapalli and Sandur, two petty states, of which the first is ruled by a Nawab, lie in the centre of two British districts. The principal states are:\u2014\n2. Under the Government of Bombay.\u2014The native states in this presidency number about 370. Area, 69,045 square miles. Population, 8,059,298. Revenue about Rx. 3,451,000.

Under the Government of Bengal there are twenty-nine states. Area, 35,834 square miles. Population, 3,296,379. Revenue, about Rx. 270,900.\n\nThese states may be divided into two groups: the first consisting of the petty states attached to the Orissa and Chota Nagpur divisions, 24 in number; and the other comprising the states of Kuch Behar to the north, and Hill Tipperah to the east, of Bengal. The inhabitants of the first group are hillmen of Kolarian or Dravidian origin, and their condition is still very primitive. Kuch Behar is inhabited by a Mongoloid people, the Koch. The population of Sikkim consists of the Thibetan races of Lepcha and Bh\u00f3ti, and the Nip\u00e1li tribe, Limbu. Hill Tipperah is the home of a Mongoloid race, partly drawn from the Eastern Himalayas, and allied to the Kach\u00e1ri of Assam. The principal states are:\n\n| Name          | Area   | Population | Approximate Revenue |\n|---------------|--------|------------|---------------------|\n| Kuch Behar    | 1,307  | 578,868    | 207,000             |\n| Hill Tipperah | 4,086  | 137,442    | 61,000              |\n\n4. Under the Government of the N.-W.-P. and Oudh, the native territory comprises the following two states, the first being ruled by a Muhammadan, and the second by a Hindu, dynasty.\n\n| Name               | Area   | Population | Approximate Revenue |\n|--------------------|--------|------------|---------------------|\n| Rampur             | 945    | 551,249    | 475,000             |\n| Tehri (Garhwal)    | 4,164  | 241,242    | 25,000              |\nRampur is nearly equally divided between Muhammadans and Hindus. The inhabitants of Tehri are chiefly Hindus.\n\n5. Under the Government of the Punjab there are 34 states, varying considerably in size and importance. Area, 38,299 square miles. Population, 4,263,280. Revenue, about Rx. 1,244,000.\n\nThe Punjab states may be grouped under three main classes. The hill states, 23 in number, lie among the Punjab Himalayas and are held by some of the most ancient Rajput families in all India. Along the western half of the southern border lies the Muhammadan state of Bahawalpur. The remaining states, including the Sikh principalities of Patiala, Jind, Nabha, Kapurthala, Faridkot and Kalsia, and the Muhammadan chiefships of Maler Kotla, Pataudi, Loharu and Dujana, lie east of Lahore, and, with insignificant exceptions, occupy the centre of the eastern plains of the province.\n\nThe list below gives details of the area, population, and revenue of the more important states:\n\n| Name          | Area | Population | Approximate Revenue |\n|---------------|------|------------|---------------------|\n| Bahawalpur    | 17,285 | 650,042   | 160,000             |\n| Chamba        | 3,126 | 124,032   | 35,000              |\n| Faridkot      | 643   | 115,040   | 30,000              |\n| Jind          | 1,268 | 284,560   | 67,000              |\n| Kapurthala    | 598   | 299,690   | 200,000             |\n| Maler Kotla   | 162   | 75,755    | 30,000              |\n| Mandi         | 1,131 | 166,923   | 40,000              |\n| Nabha         | 936   | 282,756   | 70,000              |\n| Patiala       | 5,951 | 1,583,521 | 557,000             |\n| Sirmur (Nahan)| 1,108 | 124,134   | 23,000              |\n\n6. Under the Chief Commissioner of the Central Provinces are 15 states. Their total area is 29,435 square miles, with a population of 2,160,511 persons. Revenues, about Rx. 130,000. The inhabitants are chiefly Hindus and aborigines. The principal states are:\n\n| Name     | Area | Population | Approximate Revenue |\n|----------|------|------------|---------------------|\n| Bastar   | 13,062 | 310,884   | 20,000              |\n| Kalahandi| 3,745 | 326,295   | 13,000              |\n| Patna    | 2,399 | 332,197   | 11,000              |\n\n7.
