On Saturday morning Mr. Farrington's pile numbered 130 quires, for which Briggs and a witness named Hunt came. By the side of Mr. Farrington's papers was a pile of 26 quires for Mr. Golding. A few minutes after the prisoner and Hunt left, Mr. Golding's men came for his papers, when they could not be found. Information was at once given, and six quires of Lloyd's were found in Fleet-street, in charge of a lad named Winstone, who said that a young man named Donovan had deposited them with him to sell.\u2014William Wins, plain clothes patrol, said that he went to Donovan and took him into custody, and he at once told him that Briggs put 26 quires down by the door of the Telegraph, about five o'clock on Saturday morning, and asked him to take six quires of them to Winstone, at the corner of Shoe-lane, and to mind the rest for him. He took the six quires as directed, but having to go somewhere else he took 10 quires (what were then left) into the Kings and Key publichouse in Fleet-street, and left them there for Briggs. The barmen gave them up to witness when he asked for them. Witness afterwards arrested the prisoner, who said he knew nothing at all about the papers, and did not see Donovan until after seven o'clock on Saturday morning.\u2014Edward Hunt said that he and Briggs loaded Mr. Farrington's cart at Lloyd's office. He brought six parcels of 10 quires each out and put them into the cart, and Briggs brought the rest out. They delivered the 130 quires of papers to Mr. Farrington, and then Briggs drove away and afterwards told him that he had left the other papers with Donovan.\u2014Mr. Knowles, a newsvendor, of Crown-court, Pall-mall, said Hunt tried to sell him some of the stolen papers as he came out of the Telegraph office, and somebody then called Hunt a thief. He refused to buy the papers.\u2014Abraham Lyon said that he saw Briggs take some quires of Lloyd's Papers out of his cart, put them down by the Daily Telegraph office, and ask Donovan to take care of them.\u2014On the first day of hearing Donovan made his defence as in the above evidence, and Briggs declared that as he was driving down Salisbury-court Donovan asked him to take the 26 quires to the Telegraph office for him, and he did so. Sir R. Carden, however, believed that Donovan was innocent, and discharged him. It was brought out in cross-examination that Donovan had suffered 18 months' imprisonment for stealing papers, and that Lyon had been charged, but acquitted, on a similar accusation.\u2014Mr. Wontner contended that looking at the character of the only evidence that could at all affect his client no jury would convict. Sir R. Carden said that considering the character of the men upon whom the case would rest, he did not think a jury would convict, and he did not wish to send a young man for trial where a conviction was not likely to follow; but at the same time he had a very strong feeling on the matter, and advised him to be more careful in his future conduct, and discharged him.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3206238659.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 878, "total-output-tokens": 813, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 3387, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
