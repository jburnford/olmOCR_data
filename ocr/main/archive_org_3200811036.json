The girl had been missing from home since the previous morning. An inquest was opened on Friday on the body. The murder theory was discredited by the evidence, it being shown that the child was killed by the rupture of the liver, caused probably by the tipping of rubbish on her while asleep on the dust-heap. The inquiry was adjourned for a week.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3200811036.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 1292, "total-output-tokens": 175, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 649, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
