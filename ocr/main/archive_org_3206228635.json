Carter, the coroner, held an inquest at the Crown, Church-street, Lambeth, on the body of John Blackburn, aged forty-six, of Lambeth, boiler maker. The deceased, who resided at 1, Granby-buildings, Broad-street, Lambeth, and was in the employ of Messrs. Maudslay, had engaged, on his own account, to repair a boiler for Cox and Son, of Belvidere-road, and the job having been completed, he, with a labourer named Walshen, was, between nine and ten o'clock on Thursday morning, in the boiler-house for the purpose of testing the work, the steam having been got up for that purpose. The deceased having discovered an escape of steam from a joint of the supply pipe, commenced caulking or packing with iron borings and red lead, and while forcing this home with a podging tool the joint suddenly burst with a loud noise resembling the report of a cannon, the packing, together with the steam, being driven into the deceased's face, knocking him down and driving him to a distance of several yards. The deceased was found lying on the floor quite dead. Mr. Walter Cross, surgeon, of York-road, said deceased appeared to have been suffocated as well as to have suffered from scalding and the being struck in the face from the packing. The jury, after a brief deliberation, returned a verdict of \"Accidental death.\"", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3206228635.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 1890, "total-output-tokens": 347, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 1352, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
