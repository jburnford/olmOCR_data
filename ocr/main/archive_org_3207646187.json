The factors, to effect sales, readily submit to a decline of from 1s to 2s per quarter. Fine new malting barley has appeared in the market this morning, but on account of the malting season not having commenced, little business has been done in it. Oats are dull sale, and are 6d to 1s per quarter lower. Beans remain as on last market day, but white and maple peas are worth 1s per quarter more than they were then quoted.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3207646187.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 1062, "total-output-tokens": 186, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 672, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
