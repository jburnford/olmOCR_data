WESTON.\n\nSole Contractors for Printing to the Punjab Government.\n\n1910.\nPreface to Part A of the Chamba Gazetteer, 1910.\n\nThe preparation of the Chamba Gazetteer was commenced in 1903 by Mr. H. A. Rose, C.S., when that officer was entrusted with the superintendence of Gazetteer work in the Province generally. Largely aided by Dr. J. Hutchison, of the Church of Scotland Mission, Chamba, that officer had collected a mass of material and of text which was thought sufficient to go to press with. Printing was commenced, and Messrs. Hancock Prenter, C.S., and A. Campbell, C.S., were in turn entrusted with the task of editing. In 1906, however, Dr. Hutchison represented that, as the result of recent research, much of the text he had furnished was found to be incomplete, and he would prefer an opportunity to put it into better form and also to rearrange the materials. It was, therefore, considered that the best course would be to reprint *de novo*, and to ask Dr. Hutchison if he would undertake to pass the whole work through the press. This Dr. Hutchison very kindly consented to do, and the present work is the result of his labours, rendered gratuitously since 1906. In addition to re-writing the text which was to hand in 1906, Dr. Hutchison has added a large amount of fresh and interesting matter, which has entailed much care and research. For the articles on Archaeology, Geology and Fauna the compilation is indebted, respectively, to Dr. J. Ph. Vogel, Ph.D., Superintendent, Archaeological Survey, Northern Circle; the late Lieutenant-General C. A. McMahon, F.G.S., formerly Commissioner of Lahore, and Colonel C. H. T. Marshall, late Superintendent of Chamba. The articles on Botany, Ferns and Forests were prepared, respectively, by Mr. J. R. Drummond, C.S., Mr. J. C. McDonell, Imperial Forest Service and Mr. C. G. Trevor, Conservator of Forests, Chamba. The contribution on the Dialects of the State is the work of the Rev. T. Grahame Bailey, B.D., Church of Scotland Mission, Wazirabad.\n\nDr. Hutchison has requested that record may be made of the valuable assistance he has received from His Highness Raja Sir Bhure Singh, K.C.S.I., C.I.E., who has taken the deepest interest in the work, and has personally revised and checked the greater part of the Gazetteer as it passed through the press; the articles on Administration and Revenue being from his own hand. But the main labour and responsibility of preparing the whole work has fallen upon Dr. Hutchison, to whom Government and the Chamba State are under a debt of very great obligation. As Political Officer of the State I am well aware of the immense amount of time, attention and care which Dr. Hutchison has so conscientiously and gratuitously devoted upon the compilation, which is not only valuable as an official and statistical record, but is made attractive to the historian, the antiquary and to the public generally.\n\nLahore:\nDated the 8th July 1910.\n\nC. G. Parsons, I.A.,\nPolitical Officer, Chamba State.\n# TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\n| Subject                                      | Page |\n|----------------------------------------------|------|\n| **CHAPTER

It is situated in the bosom of the Himalaya Mountains, between north latitude $32^\\circ 11' 30\"$ and $33^\\circ 13' 6\"$, and east longitude $75^\\circ 49' 0\"$ and $77^\\circ 3' 30\"$. The boundaries are as follows:\n\nOn the north-west and west, Jammu and Kashmir; on the north-east and east, Ladakh, British-Lahul and Bara Bangial; on the south-east and south, the Districts of Kangra and Gurdaspur.\n\nThe superficial area of the State is 3,216 square miles; with a population of 127,834, giving a proportion of 40\u00b79 to the square mile.\n\nChamb\u00e1, the capital, and the only town in the principality, has a population of 6,000. It stands on a plateau on the right bank of the R\u00e1v\u00ed, 18 miles east of the Hill Station of Dalhousie, and about 50 miles from Sh\u00e1hpur, where the R\u00e1v\u00ed debouches on the plains.\n\nIn shape the State is more or less of a rough oblong, contracted towards the north. The greatest length, from south-west to north-east, is about 70 miles; and the greatest breadth, from southeast to north-west, about 50 miles. The average length may be put at 65 miles, and the average breadth at 50 miles. Within this area, are comprised a small portion of the Bi\u00e1s Valley; a section of the R\u00e1v\u00ed Valley, which is the Chamb\u00e1 Valley Proper; and a similar section of the Chen\u00e1b Valley, called P\u00e1ng\u00ed and Chamb\u00e1-Lahul. The territory is wholly mountainous, with altitudes ranging from 2,000 to 21,000 feet above sea level; the inhabited area reaching to 10,000 feet.\n\nBefore describing the main ranges it will be convenient to refer briefly to a low range, called the H\u00e1thi Dh\u00e1r, running to the south of the Dhaula Dh\u00e1r and parallel to it, at a distance of 10 miles as the crow flies, or 20 miles by road. This range, of which the highest point is 5,256 feet, is really the inner ridge of the Siwalik area, and maintains an almost unbroken course from taluka Rihlu in Kangra to the R\u00e1v\u00ed. Near its eastern extremity a spur from the Dhaula Dh\u00e1r joins it, almost at right angles, forming the boundary between Chamb\u00e1 and Rihlu, and the border line is continued along the crest of the H\u00e1thi Dh\u00e1r to the left bank of the R\u00e1v\u00ed, separating Chamb\u00e1 from the Kangra and Gurdaspur Districts. To the west the R\u00e1v\u00ed forms the boundary between Chamb\u00e1 and Jammu.\n\nThe H\u00e1thi Dh\u00e1r, like the other ranges, is steeper on its southern than on its northern flank. It is composed of sandstones and\nCHAP. I. A.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\n\nConglomerates of tertiary age; and being of such low altitude, is covered with dense undergrowth and forest, chiefly *Pinus longifolia* and dwarf oaks.\n\nThree Snow Ranges.\n\nIn the Chamb\u00e1 State the Him\u00e1laya Mountains present three well-defined snowy ranges, which constitute the most striking orographical feature in the territory. These run more or less parallel to one another, from south-east to north-west; and from 30 to 40 miles apart. The first range\u2014the one nearest the plains\u2014is called the Outer Him\u00e1laya, or Dhaula Dh\u00e1r, and in Kangra is generally spoken of as \"the Chamb\u00e1 Range.\" It separates the basin of the Bi\u00e1s from that of the R\u00e1vi. The second range is the Mid-Him\u00e1laya, or P\u00e1ng\u00ed Range, the Pir Panjal of geologists, forming the watershed between the R\u00e1vi and the Chen\u00e1b. The third is the Inner Him\u00e1laya or Z\u00e1nskar Range, between the Chen\u00e1b and the Indus. These ranges are all in general continuity with the main Him\u00e1layan chains from the east, and are continued westward into Kashmir territory.\n\nThe Dhaula Dh\u00e1r begins on the right bank of the Bi\u00e1s, and running north by west forms the boundary between Mand\u00ed and Kulu. At the point where it gives off the Bara Bang\u00e1hal Range to join the Mid-Him\u00e1laya, it makes a sudden bend to the westward, and first touches Chamb\u00e1 territory on the western border of taluka Bang\u00e1hal. From this point, for 36 miles, it forms the boundary between Kangra and the Chamb\u00e1 State. Opposite the western border of taluka Ribhu, the State boundary, which has followed the crest of the range, is deflected to the south as far as the eastern end of the H\u00e1th\u00ed Dh\u00e1r, and from this point to the R\u00e1vi the Dhaula Dh\u00e1r is wholly in State territory. It now gradually declines in height, finally ending on the left bank of the R\u00e1vi near Dalhousie; at its western extremity it is only from 5,000 to 8,000 feet in altitude. The Chatar Dh\u00e1r, in Jammu territory, of which the Kund Kaml\u00e1s peak, 14,241 feet, is a conspicuous object from Dalhousie, is geologically a continuation of the Dhaula Dh\u00e1r.\n\nFeatures of the Range.\n\nFor the greater part of its course in the State the Dhaula Dh\u00e1r forms a lofty mountain barrier, with peaks from 14,000 to 17,000 feet, and the mean altitude is about 15,000 feet. The passes are 8,000 to 15,000 feet in height. Viewed from the south it stands out in clear and bold relief as it rises abruptly, and almost perpendicularly, from behind the low ranges at its base, which it over-tops by 13,000 feet. The lower slopes are covered with forests of oak and pine; the sides are seamed with water-courses; while above all the lofty peaks rise in stern and rugged grandeur covered by wastes of snow, or shoot up in massive pinnacles of bare granite, too steep for the snow to rest on.\n\nTowards the north the general contour of the range presents a marked and striking contrast. The mountain sides are much less precipitous, and the spurs splay off in long and gentle slopes,\nwhich decline gradually till they reach the R\u00e1vi. This abrupt and almost perpendicular drop on the southern flank, and the more gradual decline towards the north, is a general and prominent feature, more or less, of all the Himalayan ranges. Towards the western extremity of the Dhaula Dh\u00e1r, where the height is so much diminished, the oaks and pines surmount the range, clothing it, especially on the northern slopes, with dense forests, interspersed with rhododendron trees in great profusion; displaying in early spring a wealth of blossom that is very pleasing to the eye.\n\nThe Dhaula Dh\u00e1r is composed of gneissose granite, flanked on both sides by rocks of Silurian and Carboniferous age. The granite has a greyish appearance on exposure, and hence the name of the range, from the word *dhaula*, meaning grey.\n\nThe Mid-Himalaya, or P\u00e1ngi Range, is a direct continuation of the main Himalayan axis. After separating Kulu from L\u00e1hul and Spiti, it enters Chamb\u00e1 territory on the western border of Bara Bang\u00e1hal, and traverses the State, from south-east to north-west, for more than 60 miles. This range divides the territory into two large sections of unequal size, and severs these from each other to such an extent that even in summer there is comparatively little intercommunication; while for four or five months in winter the passes are blocked with snow, and all intercourse, for the time, is at an end. The northern or smaller section, called P\u00e1ngi and Chamb\u00e1-L\u00e1hul, is then completely isolated from the outer world. So forbidding was this snowy range regarded in former times, that every State official proceeding to P\u00e1ngi on duty was granted a special allowance, under the head of \"funeral expenses,\" as he was not expected to return. For the same reason, P\u00e1ngi was formerly made use of as a place of banishment for criminals and political offenders.\n\nThis range forms a second mountain barrier with magnificent snowy peaks, some of which reach an altitude of 19,000 feet. The mean elevation cannot be less than 17,000 feet; and the passes range from 14,328 to 17,000 feet. The only position from which a panoramic view of the range can be obtained is from D\u00e1yankund, at the western end of the Dhaula Dh\u00e1r, near Dalhousie. Seen from this point, at a distance of 30 or 40 miles, it is a grand and imposing spectacle, though the effect is softened and impaired by distance and the intermediate ranges, many of which attain a high altitude. In this range also the southern flanks are abrupt and precipitous, while to the north, on the other hand, the spurs subside gradually to the Chandr\u00e1bh\u00e1g\u00e1. After passing out of the State the range continues its course westward to join the Pir Panj\u00e1l Proper, with which it is in unbroken line, except where it is pierced by the Chandr\u00e1bh\u00e1g\u00e1 at Kashtw\u00e1r.\n\nAt the point where the P\u00e1ngi Range first touches State territory it gives off the Man\u00ed Mahes Range to the south, which\nCHAMBA STATE.\n\nThe Zanskar Range.\n\nCHAP. I. A. divides Chamb\u00e1 from Bara Banghal as far as the R\u00e1v\u00ed; thence the boundary runs up to the summit of the Dhaula Dh\u00e1r.\n\nOn the north-west border, where the P\u00e1ng\u00ed Range leaves the territory, it gives off a branch range to the south-west, called D\u00e1g\u00e1n\u00ed Dh\u00e1r, which forms the boundary between Chamb\u00e1 and Bhadraw\u00e1h in Jammu. At its western extremity this range is connected with the Chatar Dh\u00e1r by a short ridge, in which are the Padari and Chatar Dh\u00e1r Passes. Orographically the D\u00e1g\u00e1n\u00ed Dh\u00e1r and Chatar Dh\u00e1r are different sections of one continuous range, forming, with the P\u00e1ng\u00ed Range, the watershed between the R\u00e1v\u00ed and the Chandr\u00e1bh\u00e1g\u00e1. The State boundary follows the crest of the D\u00e1g\u00e1n\u00ed Dh\u00e1r to a point west of the Padari Pass, where it is deflected to a spur from the ridge mentioned above, along which it runs, in a southerly direction, as far as the old fort of Prithvijor. Thence the Row\u00e1 stream forms the boundary to its junction with the Siowa, and the latter to its junction with the R\u00e1v\u00ed; separating Chamb\u00e1 from Balor in Jammu. On the Trigonometrical Survey maps the boundary near the Padari Pass is shown as following the crest of the ridge and doubtless this was the original, as it is the natural boundary; but the line has now been thrown back into Chamb\u00e1 territory as far as Kund\u00ed Mar\u00fal, a distance of six or seven miles from the Padari Pass. The change probably took place at the time of the annexation of Bhadraw\u00e1h by Jammu. The P\u00e1ng\u00ed Range and the D\u00e1g\u00e1n\u00ed Dh\u00e1r are composed of silurian rocks, chiefly schists, slates, and Blaini conglomerate.\n\nThe Inner Himalaya, or Zanskar Range, is the most direct continuation of the main Himalayan axis. After leaving the Sutlej it runs in a north-western direction, dividing Lad\u00e1kh from Spiti and L\u00e1hul. It then closes in the Chamb\u00e1 State for a short distance, along its northern border, separating Chamb\u00e1-L\u00e1hul from Zanskar, and farther west forms the northern boundary of the Kashmir Valley.\n\nThis magnificent mountain chain is so masked by lofty ranges in front, that there is no point from which any considerable portion of it can be viewed. The mean altitude is about 18,000 feet, and some of the peaks rise to 20,000. The passes in P\u00e1ng\u00ed and P\u00e1dar are 17,000 to 18,000 feet, and are thus higher than those of the P\u00e1ng\u00ed Range, and are also more difficult owing to the size of the permanent glacier. Those in British-L\u00e1hul, on the other hand, are easy and practicable for laden animals. The range is chiefly composed of gneissose granite.\n\nThe boundary between Chamb\u00e1-L\u00e1hul and British-L\u00e1hul is formed by a spur from the Zanskar Range, separating the Miy\u00e1r and the K\u00e1do Tokpo streams, and ending at the Tirot N\u00e1la on the\n\n(1) The names Chatar Dh\u00e1r, Tud\u00e1h, D\u00e1g\u00e1n\u00ed, and Sah\u00f3 apply to only a section of each range. They are here used generally for convenience of description.\n(2) The Badraw\u00e1r of the maps.\nChandr\u0101bh\u0101ga; whence the line ascends to the crest of the P\u00e1ngi Range. On the north-west border of P\u00e1ngi a similar spur leaves the Z\u00e1nskar Range near the source of the Danlong (Bhutna) N\u00e1l\u00e1, and, running to the south of that stream, carries the border to the head of the Ganaur N\u00e1l\u00e1, which, from this point to the Chandr\u0101bh\u0101ga, is the boundary between P\u00e1ngi and P\u00e1dar. Thence the line rises to the crest of the P\u00e1ngi Range to follow the D\u00e1gan\u00ed Dh\u00e1r.\n\nHaving now outlined the principal ranges in the State, it remains to describe the intervening valleys.\n\nThe greater part of the tract between the H\u00e1thi Dh\u00e1r and the Dhaula Dh\u00e1r is in the Bi\u00e1s Valley, and, with the addition of a small portion of the lower R\u00e1v\u00ed Valley, forms the Bhattiyat Wiz\u00e1rat, which, in proportion to its size, is the most populous and fertile sub-division of the State. The southern section of this area, composed of sandstone and conglomerate, is an integral part of the Siw\u00e1l\u00edk, and has the same physical and botanical features. Its vegetation is semi-tropical, and the bamboo, the pipal, and the mango flourish luxuriantly in close proximity to the fir, the barberry and the oak. Two crops are garnered in the year, the cereals chiefly grown being rice and maize, alternating with wheat and barley. The northern section contains the spurs from the main range, composed of silurian and carboniferous rocks, and, being more elevated than the other, is therefore more alpine in character. The cantonment of Bakloh is located near the line of contact of the sandstones with the older rocks.\n\nThe region between the Dhaula Dh\u00e1r and the P\u00e1ngi Range constitutes the drainage area of the R\u00e1v\u00ed. It is occupied by the spurs of the high ranges, splaying off at all angles, and intermingling with one another in such a way that they lose all semblance of regularity or order. They are intersected by deep narrow valleys, in which flow the various streams that bring down their tribute to the R\u00e1v\u00ed. Of these the largest is the Siul, which drains the whole of the north-western portion of the Chamb\u00e1 Valley.\n\nExamined more closely, this region is seen to be naturally divided into three fairly distinct sections, corresponding to three out of the five Wiz\u00e1rats of the State. This division is made by a spur from the P\u00e1ngi Range, thrown off to the south about midway in its course through the territory, which soon bifurcates, one branch running to the south-east and the other to the south-west. The first is the Tund\u00e1h Range, which gradually declines, and finally ends on the R\u00e1v\u00ed opposite Chhatr\u00e1ri, from whence the line of separation is continued, by the Chirchind N\u00e1l\u00e1, to the Dhaula Dh\u00e1r; the other is the Saho Range, which comes to an end in the fork, at the junction of the R\u00e1v\u00ed and the Siul, the line being prolonged to the Dhaula Dh\u00e1r by the Chil and K\u00e1l\u00e1top Spur. The area embraced between these spurs is triangular in shape, with its\nbase at the Dhauia Dh\u00e1r, and forms the Chamb\u00e1 or Sadr Wiz\u00e1rat, in which is situated the capital of the State.\n\nThe portion to the north-west of the Saho Range includes the entire basin of the Sin\u00ed, and is called the Chur\u00e1h Wiz\u00e1rat.\n\nThe area to the south-east of the Tund\u00e1h Range comprises the Valley of the R\u00e1v\u00ed from below Bara Bang\u00e1hal, with its tributaries, the Budhil and the Tund\u00e1hen, as far down as the Chirehind N\u00e1l\u00ed, near Cuhatr\u00e1ri. This is called the Br\u00e1hmaur Wiz\u00e1rat, and is the oldest portion of the State, containing the ancient capital. It is also called Gadder\u00e1n, or the country of the Gaddis.\n\nBara Bang\u00e1hal contains the head waters of the R\u00e1v\u00ed, and is, therefore, a part of the R\u00e1v\u00ed valley, but it never belonged to Chamb\u00e1. It was formerly the northern province of a small Native State called Banguhal, which was absorbed in Kulu and Mandi about A.D. 1700. The Bara Bang\u00e1hal Range separates it from Kulu.\n\nThe R\u00e1v\u00ed or Chamb\u00e1 Valley, as a whole, is fairly open, and the means of communication are good. The scenery is of a picturesque and varied character, presenting many delightful contrasts. In the lower Valley, at an elevation of 3,000 feet and under, the vegetation is semi-tropical, the wild olive, pomegranate and fig mingling with the acacia, shisham, pipal and other trees found in the plains. Where they are open, the valleys are covered with rich verdure which extends up the mountain slopes, while interspersed are villages, each in the midst of its own cultivated area, lending an exceedingly pleasing appearance to the landscape. On the mountain slopes the fields are usually of small size, and are arranged in terraces, the lower border of each being formed by a rough wall to make the ground more level for ploughing. The villages, too, are diminutive, seldom containing more than a dozen houses. In most parts of the R\u00e1v\u00ed Valley, under 7,000 feet, two crops are reaped. These are rice in the lower levels, with maize, wheat, barley and other cereals higher up. Above 7,000 feet only one crop, as a rule, is garnered. The mountain slopes, especially those with a northern aspect, are usually densely wooded; while those with a southern aspect are often quite bare, owing to their greater exposure to the sun. Under 6,000 feet the trees most commonly found are Pinus longifolia, oak, holly, rhododendron and chestnut; at a greater elevation pines and cedars form extensive forests, and above these are birch and juniper. The mountain sides, especially at high altitudes, are carpeted with flowers of every hue, which come out in great profusion as the snow melts and disappears. Towering over all are mighty pinnacles of rock, rearing themselves to an altitude of 19,000 feet, with vast fields of glacier and untrodden snow. This, in general outline, is what the region is like in spring,\nand all through the summer, the snow line gradually retreating higher, till in July and August peaks of 15,000 feet become quite bare. On the P\u00e1ng\u00ed Range the permanent snow line stands at about 15,000 feet on the southern side, and 14,000 feet on the northern. New snow begins to fall on the higher ranges in September, and during the remaining months of the year the snow line steadily descends till, in December, January, and February, snow may fall in the valleys, 2,500 feet above sea level. In the capital, with an elevation of 3,000 feet, it is rare for a winter to pass without several falls. In the upper valleys snow lies very deep, and in the Br\u00e1hmaur Wiz\u00e1ra', it is customary for most of the villagers to migrate to the lower valleys for the winter, some coming to the capital, and others going to K\u00e1ngra. This custom is not found in any other part of the State. It is probably of ancient origin, and the people speak of going to 'J\u00e1ndar,' as they call the country to the south of the Dhaula Dh\u00e1r. This migration takes place in November, and the return journey in April or May. Some members of the village community remain at home, by pre-arrangement, to tend the cattle and look after the property, but the villages in Br\u00e1hmaur Wiz\u00e1ra' are almost deserted during winter.\n\nThe region between the P\u00e1ng\u00ed and Z\u00e1nskar Ranges is somewhat of an irregular square, each side of which is about 35 miles. It comprises the Valley of the Chandrabh\u00e1g\u00e1 through nearly 80 miles of its course, from the Tirot N\u00e1l\u00e9 in British L\u00e1bul, to the Ganaur or Sans\u00e1ri N\u00e1l\u00e9, separating P\u00e1ng\u00ed from P\u00e1dar in Jamm\u00fa. This area forms the fifth Wiz\u00e1ra' of the State. It is in many respects very different from the R\u00e1vi Valley. The Chandrabh\u00e1g\u00e1, throughout the whole of its course in the territory, flows at a higher level than the R\u00e1vi, being 9,000 feet above the sea at Tirot, and nearly 7,000 feet where it enters P\u00e1dar.\n\nThis region is divided into two parts, of nearly equal size, by a lofty spur from the Z\u00e1nskar Range, called Gurdh\u00e1r, with peaks of 21,000 feet, the highest in the State, running in a south-westerly direction between the Saichu and Miy\u00e1r N\u00e1l\u00e9, and ending opposite Tind\u00ed. The north-western portion, from Rauli to the Ganaur N\u00e1l\u00e9, is P\u00e1ng\u00ed; and the south eastern, from Rauli to Tirot, is Chamb\u00e1-L\u00e1bul.\n\nP\u00e1ng\u00ed is unique in its grandeur and beauty: in this respect far surpassing any other portion of the State. The scenery is sublime and imposing, and Nature appears in her wildest and grandest moods. Everything is on a stupendous scale. The great river rolls along in a deep and narrow gorge, lashing itself into fury against the adamantine cliffs that confine it. Precipices spring from the brink, in places almost perpendicular, to a height of one\n\n(1) Rauli is an uninhabited grassy slope about halfway between Shor (Saor) and Tind\u00ed; not marked on the map.\nor two thousand feet: on the lower ranges are grassy slopes of rich pasture with dense forests of pine and cedar, while high over all, the stern and majestic mountains, piled on one another, attain an altitude of 18,000 to 21,000 feet, rising far beyond the line of eternal snow. But all is not sublimity and grandeur. Every few miles the traveller reaches fairly open nooks of surpassing beauty, which may have been small lakes in some by-gone age, while the river was cutting its way through a rocky barrier in front. There the villages are chiefly to be found. These are few in number, and of small size, for the country is sparsely inhabited. The roads are just what one might expect in such a region, narrow and dangerous, so narrow indeed, that in some places there is barely room for two people to pass each other; in other parts the precipice affords no space for a road, which has to be carried along the face of the cliff, supported on iron bars fixed horizontally into the rock. Elsewhere the path crosses from ledge to ledge by means of trangaris, or narrow wooden bridges of a primitive and insecure kind, sometimes at a giddy height above the torrent. There are several beautiful side valleys in Pangi of which the principal are the Saichu, Parmaur, Hun\u00e1n, and Sur\u00e1l N\u00e1ks, all leading up to the Zanskar Range. Though narrow where they join the main valley they are fairly open higher up\u2014and contain a considerable number of villages. Those near the head of each n\u00e1la are occupied by Tibetans, called Bhot, and for this reason are called 'Bhotauri.'\n\nThe winter season in Pangi and L\u00e1bul is very severe. Snow may begin to fall in the lower parts of the valley as early as October, but it does not lie permanently till December. From that time till March or April the whole valley is deep under snow, and communication with the outer world, and even between the various centres of population, is completely suspended. During these months the people are, for the most part, confined to their houses, but they move about when the snow has hardened under foot, and the weather is favourable. They employ themselves chiefly in rope-making and other occupations which can be carried on indoors. Food provision for the winter months has, of course, to be made beforehand, both for themselves and their cattle. When spring sets in they scatter earth over the remaining heaps of snow to melt them, and clear the ground for ploughing and sowing.\n\nThe crops grown in Pangi are chiefly wheat and barley with phulan, bres, elo and masar. There is as a rule only one harvest in the year, though in places two are reaped. The wheat and barley crops are sown late in the autumn, and are reaped in the following June or July, after which a crop of phulan or bres may be sown, and reaped in October.\n\nThe pastures of Pangi are considered to be very rich, especially those on the higher mountain slopes. Each village usually has its own adw\u00e1ri, or summer pasture, in these uplands, where all the sheep\nand cattle are taken in the early summer, and kept till late in the autumn. Many other pasture-grounds, called *g\u0101har*, are let out every year by the State to shepherds from the R\u0101v\u012b Valley, who cross the P\u0101ng\u012b Range in great numbers, with their flocks, in order to spend a month or six weeks in these rich uplands. They usually arrive in July, and return in September into the R\u0101v\u012b Valley. Thence they move by easy stages over the Dhau\u1e47a Dh\u0101r into the Siwaliks, and as far as the edge of the plains, arriving there in November and December. The return journey is begun in February.\n\nChamb\u0101-L\u0101hul is the lower half of the province of that name, the upper half being British territory, having previously formed a part of the Kingdom of K\u016bl\u016b. This division into two parts probably took place about A.D. 1680. The physical features are similar to those of P\u0101ng\u012b, except that, while the lower portion of L\u0101hul is narrow and precipitous, the upper portion is wide and open. The mountain slopes are also much less densely wooded, owing to a more scanty rainfall, and to L\u0101hul, as a whole, being at a higher altitude. The forests are chiefly composed of pines and pencil cedar and are generally confined to the northern slopes of the P\u0101ng\u012b Range. The principal side valley is the Miy\u0101r N\u016bl\u0101, which though very narrow at its mouth is quite open further up, and is chiefly inhabited by Tibetans.\n\nThe cereals grown in L\u0101hul are chiefly wheat and barley with *phulan*, *bres* and *elo*, and the land yields only one crop in the year.\n\nThe pastures in the higher mountains are considered very rich and nutritious, and numerous *g\u0101hars* are visited by shepherds with their flocks.\n\nIn the hills, the landscape is always interesting and there is endless variety to charm the eye, but nothing on the ordinary stages can compare in beauty and grandeur with the high passes. A general description applies more or less to all of them, the P\u0101ng\u012b Range being referred to. Beginning the ascent from the last village, at 7,000 feet, the road rises through forest, or up a long and narrow ravine, or it may be over steep grassy slopes. The tree line is reached at 11,500 feet, and then the forest ends, and the traveller emerges on the mountain side. Here he will pass the night at an elevation of 12,000 feet. Above him tower the massive rocky pinnacles of the high range with their drapery of snow, while glaciers fill the hollows between them. Below, the hills and valleys of the lower ranges, through which he has come, stretch far into the distance, till the horizon of vision is limited by the Dhau\u1e47a Dh\u0101r, 30 or 40 miles away. The mountain slopes around him, too, are simply fascinating in the rich expanse of floral verdure which they present. Though bare as regards trees, the ground is carpeted with flowers of every hue, reminding\none of a beautiful meadow in England in early summer. The resemblance is all the more striking, as at that altitude the flora is essentially that of a cold temperate climate. The profusion of this floral display diminishes with the increase of altitude, but many beautiful species are found almost up to the summit of the passes, where the rocks are free from snow. The second day's ascent is steep and trying for it is over snow and at an altitude which causes oppression of breathing and exhaustion. By and by, the traveller reaches the higher snow slopes, with the great pinnacles in close proximity, and is now on the permanent glacier. The scene is awe-inspiring. No sound disturbs the stillness, except that of the falling rock and avalanche. The coolies even are silent till they reach the top, for Bhagvati, the presiding deity, disapproves of any noise within her domain. After great toil the summit is gained at 14,000 to 17,000 feet, and a panorama, in its beauty and grandeur far surpassing any possible conception, lies before him. So extensive is the prospect from some of the passes, that the vision reaches beyond the intervening ranges to the south, and, on a clear day, even the great rivers of the plains may be seen at a distance of 100 miles glistening in the sunshine. Towards the north, on the other hand, the outlook is limited and, except on the Cheni, Marku and Drati Passes, there is little to be seen but the snowy peaks in the immediate vicinity. From the passes named, however, a more or less extensive view is obtained of the Chandrabhaga Valley. The descent on the northern side is more gradual and less interesting than the ascent, but it, too, has its own special features. The snow slopes in early summer are very conducive to a mode of progression, in many places more rapid than safe. Here, too, the vegetation has its own peculiar charm, though the floral display is scanty and poor in comparison with that which has been left behind. At 11,000 feet the tree line is again reached, and the road then descends rapidly to the Chandrabhaga Valley. Later in the summer, and before winter has set in, most of the passes in the Pangi Range are almost entirely clear of snow, and crossing them is then comparatively easy, and free from much of the discomfort that is unavoidable at an earlier part of the season. The floral display, if not so fresh in its bloom, is still exceedingly rich and pleasing, and adds greatly to the delights of the journey.\n\nThe passes in the Zanskar Range have special features of their own. Being higher than those of the Pangi Range, the permanent glacier is larger and the scenery grander; but the outlook is limited, being confined to the peaks near the pass. The flora on the southern slopes is exceedingly beautiful, though, owing to a scanty rainfall and more arctic conditions, it is not so luxuriant as on the outer ranges.\n\nIn the Dhaula Dh\u00e1r most of the passes are clear of snow in summer: extensive views are obtained of the Siwaliks in one direction and the inner mountains in the other.\nThe portion of the State to the south of the Dhaula Dh\u00e1r is, as already stated, within the basin of the Bi\u00e1s, and is drained by two small tributaries of that river, the Chakki and the Dairh. These streams take their rise in the Dhaula Dh\u00e1r, the Chakk\u00ed to the east of the Chu\u00e1ri Pass, and the Dairh near the Rihlu border, and, flowing south, pierce the H\u00e1th\u00ed Dh\u00e1r to make their way through the Siw\u00e1l\u00edks to the Bi\u00e1s. They are only mountain torrents containing little water, unless after heavy rain or in the rainy season, when they may be impassable for days. Such floods come down very suddenly, and the rivulet of the morning may be a rushing torrent before evening sets in.\n\nThe R\u00e1v\u00ed is pre-eminently the river of the Chamb\u00e1 State, and with its tributaries, drains the whole of the Chamb\u00e1 Valley Proper, between the Dhaula Dh\u00e1r and the P\u00e1ng\u00ed Range. The name \u2018R\u00e1v\u00ed\u2019 is identical with \u2018Ir\u00e1wati,\u2019 and in its upper reaches the river is generally called Rauti or Irauti. It takes its rise in the Mid-Him\u00e1laya and Bara Bang\u00e1hal Ranges, the latter range separating it from the Bi\u00e1s in Upper Kulu. The main source is thus in Bara Bang\u00e1hal, and it is already a stream of considerable size when it enters Chamb\u00e1 territory. It flows, in a north-westerly direction, through the il\u00e1gas of B\u00e1ra Banso, Trehta and Chanota to Ul\u00e1nsa, where it is joined by two large tributaries, the Budhil and the Tund\u00e1then. Thereafter the R\u00e1v\u00ed flows on, with augmented force and volume, through a narrow gorge to Chhatr\u00e1rf. Below this point the valley is a little more open, and after passing Pi\u00far, R\u00e1kh, and Mahla, the river trends to the north, and approaches Chamb\u00e1, which is picturesquely situated on its right bank. Here it receives the Saho or S\u00e1l from the Saho Range, and the town stands on a plateau near the junction of the two rivers. The valley is fairly open for some miles above and below the capital, but at R\u00e1j\u00f1agar it again becomes narrow. Here the river trends to the west, and soon afterwards is joined by the Siul, its largest tributary. Still flowing westward, it touches Jammu territory at the point where the Siowa stream, forming the boundary, falls into it from the north. It then bends to the south-west, and, skirting the terminal spurs of the Dhaula Dh\u00e1r, separates Chamb\u00e1 from Jammu, and finally leaves the State at Ker\u00ed, to debouch on the plains at Sh\u00e1hpur. From Sindh\u00e1ra to Sh\u00e1hpur, a distance of 25 miles, the R\u00e1v\u00ed is navigable in spring and autumn for a khatnau, or bed-raft. This is a light charpa\u00ed resting on and lashed to two dreins, or inflated skins, and on it the traveller sits, while it is piloted by two men swimming alongside. The journey can be accomplished in 7 hours and is practicable only when the river is fairly low, and the water not too cold for the men. During the winter months the R\u00e1v\u00ed is usually very low, and the water clear and transparent. It can then be forded in some places near Chamb\u00e1 by horses and men. With the approach of summer the snow on the high ranges begins to melt, while the colour of the\nwater changes to a muddy brown, and the volume rapidly increases. The maximum is reached in the rainy season, when floods of a destructive character are not uncommon. The banks being steep harm is seldom done to cultivation, but the bridges are often carried away, causing heavy loss. From the end of September the R\u00e1vi assumes its usual winter appearance.\n\nThere is fair fishing from Chamb\u00e1 downwards, and the mah\u00e1sir is often caught.\n\nThe R\u00e1vi is crossed in its upper reaches by a permanent trangari at Channir, and a temporary trangari at T\u00edr\u00ed, which is replaced by a jh\u00fala, or twig bridge, on the rise of the river at the beginning of the rains. There are good wooden cantilever bridges at Gur\u00e9la, Chur\u00ed, and Bagga; and a wire suspension bridge at Mahla. A handsome iron suspension bridge spans the river at Chamb\u00e1, erected in A.D. 1895 at a cost of Rs. 80,000. There is also a wire suspension bridge at Chaurah, north of Dalhousie; a jh\u00fala at Piur, and a gur\u00faru at Seru and also at Hat, below the junction of the Siowa. During winter the crossing may be made on dreins, or inflated skins, at several places below Chamb\u00e1, where the current is smooth, and the banks are flat. Such places are not numerous, as the R\u00e1vi is a tumultuous river with a rocky channel, which makes crossing dangerous.\n\nIn its course from Bara Bang\u00e1hal to Chamb\u00e1, the R\u00e1vi is joined on the left bank by a stream from each of the passes in the Dhaula Dh\u00e1r. Those are all of small size, and the only one deserving special mention is the Chirchind N\u00e1l\u00e1, near Chitr\u00e1ri, which forms the boundary of the Br\u00e1hmaur Wiz\u00e1rat.\n\nThe tributaries on the right bank are larger and more important. Chief among them are the Budhil and the Tund\u00e1hen. The Budhil takes its rise on the slopes of the Mid-Him\u00e1laya near the Kukti Pass, and at Harser it receives, on its left bank, the small stream from the sacred lake of Mani Mahes, situated beneath the Kail\u00e1s peak at an elevation of 13,000 feet. Ten miles lower it passes Br\u00e1hmaur, and soon afterwards mingles its waters with the R\u00e1vi at Ul\u00e1nsa. It is about 40 miles in length. The Tund\u00e1hen rises at the K\u00e1lchu Pass, in the Mid-Him\u00e1laya, and flowing through the Turd\u00e1h Valley, which is fairly open, joins the R\u00e1vi a little lower down than the Budhil. It, too, is about 40 miles in length. Next in order is the Beljedi, joining above Chur\u00ed, and the Saho or S\u00e1l from the Saho Range, which meets the R\u00e1vi at Chamb\u00e1, after a course of about 15 miles.\n\nThe Siul is the largest tributary of the R\u00e1vi, and brings down the entire drainage of the north-western portion of the Chamb\u00e1 Valley. Rising on the top of the Padari Pass, it flows south-east through a narrow ravine, to a point opposite Bingari where it makes a curve round the end of a long ridge, and flows on, at an acute angle to its original course, to join the R\u00e1vi at T\u00e9leru.\nnear Balai. Where this bend occurs it receives a stream of its own size, bringing down the waters of the Alw\u00e1s, Baira, Tissa and Ch\u00e1nj\u00fa N\u00e1l\u00e1s; all of which rise in the P\u00e1ngi Range; and of the Barnots N\u00e1l\u00e1 from the D\u00e1gam Dh\u00e1r. The Sinl is crossed by wooden bridges at Lang\u00e9ra, Bhent, Bh\u00e1ndal, Kalor, Salor and Kothi, and by a garuru at Palai in Triud.\n\nEach of the tributaries of the R\u00e1vi and the Sinl receives many accessions in its course and forms the main artery of a separate drainage-area.\n\nThe Chandr\u00e1bh\u00e1ga is the name by which the Chen\u00e1b is known in the hills. It rises near the top of the B\u00e1ra L\u00e1cha Pass in British L\u00e1hul, by two heads, the Chandra and Bh\u00e1ga. These unite at Tindi and form one river of great size and volume, which flows immediately to the north of the Mid-Him\u00e1laya and parallel to it. At Tirot it enters Chamb\u00e1-L\u00e1hul and pursues a westerly course to Tindi, after which it turns to the north. The river valley is open to Margr\u00f3n; below this point it contracts to a narrow gorge, with precipitous cliffs, as far as Tindi, where there is an open expanse on the left bank for several miles. From Tindi to Sher, 17 miles, is wild and rugged. At Shor and Purthi there are villages on the right bank, and the valley again becomes narrow as far as Mindhal and Sauch. From this point it is more open, and the river flows on in a north-westerly direction, through picturesque scenery, past Kil\u00e1r and Darwas, to the Ganaur or Saus\u00e1ri N\u00e1l\u00e1, where it leaves the territory. Thence it continues its course through P\u00e1dar, Kashtwar and the outer hills in Jammu territory, to debouch on the plains at Akn\u00far.\n\nThe waters of the Chandr\u00e1bh\u00e1ga are of a grey colour all the summer, owing to the melting snow, from its numerous sources in the snowy ranges. The volume is so great and the current so deep that it cannot be fended in any part of its course; it is also full of whirlpools, and under-currents. In the depth of winter avalanches fill up the narrow parts of the river gorge to such a degree that the villagers can cross on this snow-bridge from one side to the other. Sometimes in spring a great volume of water presses on this immense mass of snow, which, under the influence of the increasing heat, suddenly gives way, with disastrous consequences to any bridges that have not been erected at a safe elevation above high water. A similar disaster may occur in summer from the partial or complete blocking of the current by a landslip, which may suddenly yield to the great volume of water above it. There are said to be no fish in the river in any part of its course in State territory, the water being too cold.\n\nGold in small quantities is found in the Chandr\u00e1bh\u00e1ga, and gold-washing, on a small scale, is carried on at some places in State territory, as well as in British-L\u00e1hul.\nThe bridges are on the usual cantilever principle, and are found at Triloknath, Silgrain, P\u00fcrthi, Mindhal and Kil\u00e1r, with jh\u00falas at Tind\u00ed and Shor.\n\nOn its right bank the Chandr\u00e1bh\u00e1ga is joined by several streams from the Z\u00e1nskar Range and its branches. The most important of these is the Miy\u00e1r N\u00e1l\u00e1, which takes its rise from a large glacier and flows through an open valley for 40 or 50 miles, meeting the Chandr\u00e1bh\u00e1ga at Udaipur. Next in size is the Saichu N\u00e1l\u00e1 joining the main river at Sauch. Lower down are the Parman\u00e1 Hun\u00e1n, and Sur\u00e1l streams, and finally the Ganaur or Sans\u00e1ri N\u00e1l\u00e1, forming the boundary.\n\nOn the left bank the Chandr\u00e1bh\u00e1ga receives a small icestream from each of the snowy passes in the P\u00e1ng\u00ed Range. The chief of these are the Chobia and Kalicho streams at Triloknath; the Harsar, Dr\u00e1t\u00ed and Mathu streams near Tind\u00ed; and the Cheni and S\u00e1ch streams near Mindhal and Kil\u00e1r.\n\nJhulas or swing bridges are very common in the State, both in the Chamb\u00e1 and P\u00e1ng\u00ed Valleys, and a description of one of them will be interesting. They are usually made of the flexible twigs of the willow, or any other similar tree, whose slender branches can be twisted into a rope. Of these three strong cables are made, varying in length according to the breadth of the river where it is to be spanned. One of these cables is for walking on and is placed lowest, while the other two are at a slightly higher level, one on each side, for the hands to clutch. They are fixed on each bank to a stout wooden beam laid at right angles, and weighted down with stones. The cable for stepping on is composed of four or five small ropes, laid flat with each other, and tied together at short intervals by twig bands, to make it easy and safe for the foot to rest on. This cable is suspended on a level with the river banks. The other two cables are made of small ropes twisted round each other, and, after leaving the beam to which they are fixed, rise to cross a wooden fork which raises them to a higher level than the first cable. They thus form strong-hand rails to give confidence as well as support. Slender twig ropes pass from one side-cable under the foot-cable to the other side-cable, at intervals of about a yard. As the side-cables have a tendency to come together in the middle, a piece of wood is fixed between them to keep them apart, and the crossing of this obstacle is a great difficulty to a beginner in mountain travel. These jh\u00falas are sometimes as much as 30 or 40 yards in length, and high above the torrent; and crossing them needs a steady head and great care. They are renewed every third year at the utmost, and in most places every year; this work requiring the services of 40 men for a week. Accidents may happen from the jh\u00fala being allowed to remain too long unrenewed; or from too many people crowding on it at once. A sad accident occurred a few years ago in the Upper R\u00e1v\u00ed Valley from\n\n(1) Several of these n\u00e1l\u00e1s have two names, thus the Sur\u00e1l N\u00e1l\u00e1 is also called Luj\u00e1r N\u00e1l\u00e1.\ncrowding, in which many lives were lost. Not more than two, or three, should attempt to cross a *jh\u00fala* at the same time.\n\nThe *gur\u00far\u00fa* is another kind of swing bridge infrequent use, and consists of a strong rope of many strands suspended across the river, and fixed at each end in the same way as the *jh\u00fala*. From this hangs a coil of rope, attached to a wooden ring which slides along the main rope. To this ring are fixed drag-ropes from each side of the river, and the traveller being seated in the coil is hauled across through mid-air by men on the bank. The sensation of crossing is not a pleasant one, and occasionally an awkward accident happens, such as the breaking of the drag-rope when the passenger is half way across. This kind of swing bridge is called a *gur\u00far\u00fa* in the Chamb\u00e1 State, but is named differently in other parts of the hills.\n\nThe *trangari* has already been referred to, and is in very common use in the hills. Two beams are laid from bank to bank, parallel to each other, and about two feet apart. On these are placed pieces of wood cross-wise, which may or may not be lashed to the beams. There are no railings, and, if the *trangari* is at some height above the torrent, the crossing is often a matter of difficulty.\n\nThere are in the State a few mountain tarns, such as those of Khaji\u00e1r and Mani Mahes; but no lakes of any size.\n\nThe structural features of the Chamb\u00e1 State fall into line with the geological characters of the north-west Him\u00e1layas. Its leading features are the same, whilst local details vary from point to point. Along the southern margin of the mountain region we find the Lower Siw\u00e1lik, or N\u00e1han sandstones, and the Upper Siw\u00e1lik conglomerate, in contact with the old Him\u00e1layan rocks, the line of junction between them being a reversed fault, the older Him\u00e1layan rocks thus appearing above the Tertiary beds. Although the line of junction is a fault, the line also indicates the original limits of deposition of the Tertiary beds, they having been deposited against the Him\u00e1layan rocks, which formed a rising area during the deposition of the Tertiary sediments.\n\nAlong the southern margin, in the Dalhousie area, the Him\u00e1layan rocks in contact with the Tertiary zone are altered lavas to be presently described. The Tertiary beds in contact with the volcanic series usually belong to the N\u00e1han or Lower Siw\u00e1lik series, but in the Chu\u00e1ri (Chaohari) section, the Siw\u00e1lik conglomerates are directly in contact with the Trap, the lower N\u00e1han beds having been probably cut out by the fault above referred to. The dip of the N\u00e1han beds in contact with the trap is perpendicular, or nearly so. To the east of Sam\u00e1ot in the Chu\u00e1ri-Sihunta section, where the trap dies out, the Tertiary conglomerate are in contact with the Carbo-Triassic limestone series.\n\n---\n\n(1) By the late Lieut.-General C. A. McMAHON, F.R.S., F.G.S., Commissioner of Lahore.\nThe trap rocks are in contact with the Tertiary series on the northern side of the main boundary fault, and attain their greatest thickness between Kandi and Nig\u00e1li, the latter being four miles to the east of the river R\u00e1vi. The band rapidly narrows after it crosses the river at Kairi, and bending round to the west, is last seen in the bed of a stream that flows into the R\u00e1vi at Kairi, and forms the boundary between the Kashmir and the Chamb\u00e9 States. From Chambi the outcrop strikes in a south-east direction, but in a somewhat waving line, passes below the Mam\u00fal d\u00e1k-bungalow to about four miles to the south of Chu\u00e1ri, and onwards till it dies out between Sam\u00e1ot and Sihunta.\n\nThe trap is a compact rock of greenish-grey colour on its fractured surface, with occasional purplish patches in it. It usually weathers from a light-brown to a rusty-brown colour, but sometimes it varies from sage-green to a purplish neutral tint. The sage-green variety scarcely weathers at all. Amygdules abound near the upper and lower boundaries of the rock, and are occasionally to be seen in the more central portions. There are four varieties of these amygdules, white, red, and white with red borders, and green centres with red borders, the two first mentioned being the most common. The rock gives no surface indication of bedding. The specific gravity of these lavas ranges from 2\u00b776 to 2\u00b787, their average being 2\u00b783.\n\nThe microscopic examination of numerous thin slices of these rocks shows that they are true lavas which were poured out on the surface of the earth. They consist of crystals of augite and triclinic felspar which mutually interpenetrate and show that they crystallized simultaneously, embedded in what appears to have been a glassy base. The rocks are all highly altered; none of the augite is fresh, and the felspar prisms are more or less kaolinised. The base or groundmass has been highly altered by aqueous or hydro-thermal agencies, and converted into numerous secondary products, among which may be mentioned epidote, chlorite, serpentinous matter and leucoxene. The felspars are often frayed at the ends and sometimes of feathery structure, indicating rapid cooling. Judging from the extensive alteration which these rocks have sustained throughout their outcrop, I conclude that they must be of considerable age, the microscopical features thus supporting the stratigraphical evidence on this point. The amygdules seen in these rocks contain zeolites and quartz, the latter containing numerous liquid inclusions with movable bubbles. I class these rocks as altered basalts, but some of them may be regarded as altered andesites. No trace of olivine is now to be found in them, but in rocks so highly altered this fact is not remarkable.\n\nIn latter years the term Carbo-Triassic has been found to be a convenient one for a thick conformable series of limestones and intercalated slates, which are abundantly met with in the Himalayas, but which, being generally unfossiliferous, it is almost impossible\nto decide to which portion of the series any particular outcrop should be relegated, and I propose to retain this term for the various outcrops of this series found in the Chamba area.\n\nIn the Dalhousie neighbourhood the rock in contact with the volcanic series south of Daynkund is a quartzite, for the most part of white colour, which appears to correspond with the quartzite seen in the Simla region at the base of the Krol series, and at the base of the Kiol series in Kashmir. Then follows a thick outcrop of the Carbo-Triassic series, consisting of slates and limestones, the latter being in bands of from 200 to 250 feet thick, composed of beds only about two inches in thickness.\n\nThese limestones are dark-blue in colour and are indistinguishable from the Krol series of the Simla area, and correspond closely with Mr. Lydekker's description of the Kiol series in Kashmir. Blue slates are intercalated between the limestone bands.\n\nThe outcrop of the Carbo-Triassic series extends in a south-east direction, from the R\u00e1vi area to the neighbourhood of Sihunta, where it dwindles in width to a band of between 50 and 60 yards in the latter locality. The trap there also disappears and the Siwaliks are in contact with the Carbo-Triassic series.\n\nThe slates along the eastern, and occasionally along the western margin of the Carbo-Triassic outcrop under description, are dark in colour, and disintegrate under the influence of water to black shales that remind one of the black \"crush rock\" of Mr. Medlicott's infra-Krol series of the Simla area. One also finds sometimes in the Dalhousie area pale-blue to bluish-white waferly shales, the iron in which oxidizes on exposure to various shades of red, yellow and brown, similar in appearance to the waferly slates seen in the Simla area at Solon. These probably represent Mr. Lydekker's \"polychroic slates\" of Kashmir.\n\nThe blue slates dip first W., then perpendicular, and finally return to an E. or E. 11\u00b0 S. dip. The black slates dip from S. S. E. to S. E. 11\u00b0 E.\n\nProceeding northwards the rocks of the Carbo-Triassic series are succeeded by a band of gneissose-granite, the dip of which varies from about E. 11\u00b0 S. to S. E.\n\nIt is sometimes in contact with a black slate alluded to above, and sometimes in direct contact with the limestones themselves. It forms a continuous outcrop ranging from 400 to 500 feet in thickness. From the ridge above Ban\u00e1tu (trans-R\u00e1vi), where it is seen stretching away in the direction of Mandoh, its thickness remains steady, and it is well seen on the new cart road south of Duni\u00e1ra, and on the ridge between Bub\u00e1ra and Kailu. It then thins considerably and the outcrop on the bridle road north-east of Tula might easily be overlooked. On the eastern side of the ridge, however, it crops up in a very prominent way on the old, and now\nabandoned road running up to Naina Khad. It is seen well at Hubar (Ubar) and about a mile south of Chauri, where it has regained its normal thickness.\n\nI saw no trace of it on the road to Sihunta, though the road traverses all the rock series from the Siwaliks upwards. The gneissose-granite of the outer band is a rock of decidedly gneissose aspect. Most hand-specimens would be classed as streaky gneisses; others are more granitic in structure, and some are porphyritic granitoid gneisses.\n\nWhen examined under the microscope the rock is seen to be composed of quartz, felspar, biotite and muscovite, and the quartz generally predominates over the felspar, though hand-specimens might be found in which the reverse is the case. Orthoclase, including microcline, largely predominates over triclinic felspar. The quartz exhibits micro-fasceted structure, the minute grains showing a tendency to hexagonal shape. Crypto-crystalline mica occurs in all specimens. It is drawn out into strings, as is also leucoxene and ferrite, and accentuates the appearance of fluxion-structure presented by thin slices under the microscope. Magnetite, ferrite and garnets are present in all specimens, and schorl occurs in some of them. Liquid cavities with movable bubbles are of common occurrence in the rock, and are found not only in the quartz, but also in the felspar, garnet, schorl and muscovite. This fact indicates that the granite, prior to its consolidation, was in a high state of aqueo-igneous fusion, and contained a large amount of water. The rock gives evidence of having been subjected to considerable strain, which shows itself in the crumpling of leaves of mica, the bending of the twinning planes, and fracture of felspar crystals. Further remarks on the gneissose-granite will be made when I come to speak of the other outcrops.\n\nBetween the outer band of gneissose-granite, and the main outcrop of the granite at Dayankund, there intervenes an ascending series of mica-schists, fine-grained arenaceous rocks and slates, some of which, near Dalhousie, form good roofing slates, and closely resemble the slates of the Simla area.\n\nThe lower beds of this series were probably metamorphosed to some extent before the eruption of the granite, but there can be no doubt that the whole of these beds have been greatly altered by the contact-metamorphism due to the granite.\n\nThe principal contact minerals contained in these beds are mica, both dark and silvery, schorl, magnetite, garnets, cordierite, and needles and crystals of rutile: the beds in contact with the granite especially contain minerals common in the granite itself, such as biotite, muscovite, crypto-crystalline mica and garnets. At first sight this section would suggest the idea that the outer band of gneissose-granite is a conformable continuation of the mica-schists above it. But after a careful study of thin slices of numerous\nspecimens of the rocks, between Dalhousie and Banikhet, I could find no means of differentiating the outer band of granite from the inner Dalhousie band, and was forced to the conclusion that the former was injected in a partially consolidated condition between the walls of a fault; and owed its streaky and platey appearance to the great pressure exercised upon it whilst in a partially consolidated condition.\n\nThe slate series which, as said above, bears abundant marks of contact-metamorphism, has been intruded into by a mass of granite which, towards the east of our area, is about eleven miles in width. Between Dalhousie and Chamba the outcrop is 6\u00bd miles wide. It rapidly narrows in its north-western extension from Dalhousie as the R\u00e1v\u00ed is approached, and where that river is crossed by it, it has become reduced to a band of 250 feet in thickness, and a little further to the west the outcrop actually visible on the hill-side is only 100 feet in width. Further to the westward, however, it gradually expands again, and when it crosses the Chamba boundary it has attained a width of at least 500 feet.\n\nThe gneissose-granite is almost always decidedly porphyritic, though it occasionally passes into a fine-grained, non-porphyritic rock. The matrix is usually a granite of moderately large grains (never coarse), but occasionally it becomes so extremely fine-grained that the rock assumes, to the unaided eye, the appearance of a felspar-porphyry. In the perfectly granitic varieties the porphyritic crystals of felspar, which sometimes attain a length of from 3 to 3\u00bd inches, orient in all directions, and present sharply rectangular forms.\n\nFrom the porphyritic-granitic and non-porphyritic-granitic varieties, the rock passes by gradual transitions into a more or less foliated granite. The passage from one variety to the other is often apparently capricious; but even in the most perfect granitic masses a tendency towards foliation may sometimes be observed.\n\nSpeaking generally the granite of the inner outcrop is foliated along both margins, and the foliation becomes intense where the band contracts on the north side of the river R\u00e1v\u00ed to a width of 250 feet. At this point it passes, on its western margin, into what, from its microscopic aspect, would be called a mica-schist.\n\nThis granite, which bears internal evidence when examined under the microscope of being an igneous rock, is an undoubted intruder into the sedimentary beds in which it appears. It not only caused abundant contact-metamorphism in them, but it sends off tongues, veins and dykes into these rocks. It has also, in its passage through the slates and schists, torn off and carried along with it large splintery fragments of these rocks.\n\nIn the Chu\u00e1ri section, where the porphyritic-granite has along its margin been squeezed into and between the bedding of the schists, fragments of these rocks may be actually seen in the process\nof being broken off and floated away by the granite. Whether the porphyritic and non-porphyritic varieties of the granite represent mere phases of cooling, or whether they indicate a mixture of two magmas, may perhaps be open to question; but as in the Sihunta section the porphyritic variety is seen to be intrusive in the non-porphyritic fine-grained granite, the latter view seems the more probable.\n\nUnder the microscope the granite is found to be composed of orthoclase, oligoclase, microcline, quartz, biotite, muscovite, magnetite, ferrite, zircon, sphene, augite (one slice only), epidote and zoisite (in a few slices). In some localities biotite predominates, and in others muscovite. Magnetite, garnets and apatite are present as accessory minerals, and schorl is abundant in the granitic varieties. The presence of ilmenite may also be inferred from the occasional existence of leucoxene.\n\nUnder the microscope the granite yields abundant evidence of strain, pressure and shear or traction. The twinning planes of the triclinic felspar are sometimes bent; felspars are frequently cracked or fractured, and occasionally the pieces are pushed over like books on a shelf, whilst crumpled mica may be seen which has been completely bent, and one end folded over on the other like a sheet of notepaper in an envelope.\n\nA prominent characteristic of every variety of the Dalhousie gneissose-granite, even the most granitic, is the presence of what I have called in my paper by the short term of crypto-crystalline mica. It is mostly a form of muscovite, though the imperfectly crystallized material of biotite is occasionally present in ropy masses. This crypto-crystalline mica varies from a pale-buff to a pale-grey colour, and it has a superficial resemblance to the base of some felsites and rhyolites. In its typical form, though its double refraction is strong, no definite crystals of mica can be made out; and the leaflets, under polarized light, melt into each other and exhibit no definite shape.\n\nThis crypto-crystalline mica passes into a micro-crystalline condition in which the leaflets, though of extreme microscopic size, have a distinct individuality of their own. It flows in wavy lines, and frequently embraces in its streams large crystals of muscovite, quartz-grains, and other minerals; thin slices of the rock under the microscope, owing to these wavy lines of crypto-crystalline mica, often show a pronounced fluxion-structure. Another characteristic of all specimens of the Dalhousie granite is the micro-tessellated structure of some of the quartz. It behaves very much as the crypto-crystalline mica; that is to say, in the foliated specimens it flows in streams round the larger minerals, fills the interstices between larger grains of quartz, and stops the cracks in felspars.\n\nThe view I take of the cause of the foliation observed in parts of the Dalhousie granite and its other structural peculiarities is that the eruption of the granite took place along a fault in the Silurian\nslates. The granite had partially consolidated before it was moved into place; large porphyritic crystals of felspar and numerous micas and quartz-grains had formed; the semi-plastic mass was subjected to enormous pressure; the mica was crumpled, the crystals of felspar were sometimes cracked and ruptured; and so much of the micaceous silicious materials as remained unconsolidated were forced into the rents made in the already formed materials. The final consolidation took place under conditions of continued strain.\n\nThe possibility that the foliation and other structural peculiarities seen in the Dalhousie granite were produced by tangential pressure and shearing, after the complete consolidation of the granite, has been carefully considered and rejected, and my reasons for discarding this hypothesis are briefly stated as follows:\n\n1. The effect of comparatively soft rocks being crushed against a hard consolidated granite would have been felt in the sedimentary rocks rather than in the hard granite, whereas one finds the dark carbonaceous limestones and hypo-metamorphic \"black slates\", in contact with the outer band of intensely foliated and platey granite, show extremely little metamorphism.\n\nThe limestones are never more than sub-crystalline, and the carbonaceous material has not been converted into graphite. Moreover the idea that tangential pressure should be so great as to cause the formation of poly-synthetic quartz and crypto-crystalline mica throughout a solid mass of consolidated granite, ranging from six to eleven miles in width, passes belief.\n\n2. The foliation observed in the intruded granite is not always visible along the margin of the rock in contact with the slates. In places the granite, though porphyritic, is granitic in structure and is not foliated. Had the foliation observable in the porphyritic granite been the result of the shearing of a solid rock, the granitic portions next the slates could not have escaped being affected by the movement, and the sharply rectangular porphyritic crystals of felspars, which orient in all directions, would have been drawn out into strings. The partial foliation, observed in portions of the rock, is obviously due to the uniformity in direction imposed on the flakes of mica, by pressure on an imperfectly consolidated, viscous rock.\n\n3. The fact that the granite passes capriciously from a foliated to an unfoliated rock in parts away from the margin, and that long splinters of schists are met with half a mile or more from the margin of the sedimentary series, shows that the foliation observed in places cannot be due to the shearing of a consolidated rock. Had such shearing taken place the granite would have been uniformly foliated, and the embedded fragments of schist would have been ground down to wafers.\n\nA glance at the photograph of a transverse section of one of these splinters, given at page 175, Vol. XVII, of the Records, Geol.\nCHAP. I. A. Surv. Ind., representing its natural size, will show how impossible it is to entertain the idea that this portion of the granite has been sheared.\n\n4. As regards the micro-tessellar structure seen in some of the quartzes, I have shown, in a paper read before the Mineralogical Society (Min. Mag. Vol. VIII, p. 10), that this may also be produced by strain set up in a heated crystal by rapid cooling, under circumstances which put the suggestion of shearing completely out of court.\n\nThe following analyses of four specimens of the Dalhousie granite were kindly made for me by Mr. J. Hort Player, F.G.S.:\u2014\n\n|                | I    | II   | III  | IV   |\n|----------------|------|------|------|------|\n| Silica         |      |      |      |      |\n| Titania Acid   |      |      |      |      |\n| Alumina        |      |      |      |      |\n| Ferro Oxide    |      |      |      |      |\n| Ferric Oxide   |      |      |      |      |\n| Lime           |      |      |      |      |\n| Magnesia       |      |      |      |      |\n| Soda           |      |      |      |      |\n| Potash         |      |      |      |      |\n| Loss by ignition |    |      |      |      |\n\nTotal: 29.9 29.5 29.8 29.7\n\nSpecific Gravity: 2.620 2.708 2.625 2.618\n\n1.\u2014Outer band, Dhalog Ridge.

These rocks gradually become slaty, and near Masrund pass into what are indistinguishable from typical \"Simla slates.\" I have no hesitation in correlating them with that series. They remain unchanged in character down to the bed of the Sidl River, and for some distance along the course of that river towards the R\u00e1vi.\n\nPassing onwards towards Tikri the slates give place to the Carbo-Triassic limestone series, north of the village of Sangeri. The lime-tone is in massive bands, made up for the most part of beds a few inches thick. Its colour is dark-blue and creamy. It continues with a steady north-east dip to a little beyond the river that flows down from the Rundh\u00e1r station into the Sidl River, south of Kalail (Kalel), and crosses the Manjir ridge a short distance south of the village of Dh\u00e1r. It begins to die out to the west of Dh\u00e1r; the slaty micaceous beds intercalated with it become more\nprominent, and the bands of limestones become thinner and more earthy.\n\nOn the ascent of the river going in the direction of Kalaii, and some distance before the end of the limestone series is reached, a bed of dark-blue limestone occurs which abounds in crinoid stems, as first observed by Mr. Bridges Lee, then of the Calcutta Bar.\n\nThe Carbo-Triassic series extends in a south-easterly direction, as indicated on the accompanying sketch-map, until it crosses the River R\u00e1vi near Chichi and Kulais, as shown on the map. On the descent to the R\u00e1vi below Kani I noticed five outcrops of them, intercalated with slates, the first outcrop being about 300 yards in thickness. The limestones here are very earthy, and for the most part so slaty in appearance that the hammer and acid bottle had to be in constant use. A casual traveller might easily overlook these outcrops altogether.\n\nImmediately in contact with the limestone series, in the Manjir-Kulail section, there follows on its northern margin a very thick band of conglomerate, which I unhesitatingly correlate with the Blaini conglomerate of the Simla area. The matrix of the conglomerate seen in this section is a slaty schistose rock, at times even foliated. It contains pebbles of white quartz of all shapes, and of various sizes up to nine inches in diameter. Some are well rounded and present sections of the size and shape of an egg; others are sub-angular to angular.\n\nThe white quartz pebbles are the most abundant, but the rock also contains pebbles of grey and blue quartzite and quartzite-sandstone, sub-angular to rounded, which weather various colours. As in the Simla area, so here, some of the blue quartzite pebbles contain thin, white quartz-veins that do not pass into the matrix, showing that the pebbles were metamorphosed and ground down into their present shape, before they found their resting place. The pebbles in some beds are very sparse; in others very abundant.\n\nThe conglomerate differs from that of the Simla area in having expanded to great thickness. A synclinal flexure, however, takes place in the centre of these beds, and it is possible that they may also be repeated by other flexures, the evidence of which has been obliterated, or by slates of a slightly lower horizon having been folded up with them.\n\nIn any case their real thickness must very greatly exceed that of corresponding beds in the Simla area. Dr. Stoliczka estimated the thickness of the Muth conglomerate in Spiti, which he correlated with the Blaini conglomerate, at from 500 to 600 feet. At the junction of the conglomerate with the limestone series, the latter\n\n---\n\n(1) After passing Barmaur the outcrop probably bends round towards the Chobia Pass to join the Pangti outcrop. The conglomerate and limestone are seen in the Chobia Nala, east of the village of Chobia.\nhas suffered considerable contortion, and a bed of conglomerate has been, from this cause, folded up with the limestones.\n\nAs before stated, a synclinal fold takes place in the centre of the conglomerates, and a south-west dip then sets in. The beds terminate a little south of where the Si\u00fal River doubles back round the Manjir ridge towards the Padri Pass. The western extension of the conglomerate has been traced towards Langera, to within half a mile of the top of the Padri Pass, leading over into Badraw\u00e1r. The pass itself is capped with Simla slates.\n\nIn its eastern extension the conglomerate passes in the direction of Chamba, cropping out between the villages of Baroar and Chambi, a little to the north of Chamba. Its further outcrop to the east runs more or less with the river to Poulda and Kund, north-east of Chamba, beyond which I had no opportunity of tracing it along the line of the river.\n\nThe conglomerates are succeeded by rocks presenting an older facies, which last until near the top of the S\u00e1ch Pass. These may generally be described as fine-grained quartz-schists, mica-schists, and slaty mica-schists, occasionally passing locally into micaceous slates. From here to near the top of the S\u00e1ch Pass the rocks are all, I believe, of Silurian age.\n\nClose to the summit of the pass, which is 14,328 feet above the sea, the conglomerates again come in, and the dip, which had previously been very low and south-west, suddenly rises to perpendicular, and then underlies to the north-east. The anticlinal coincides with the very summit of the pass. The dip remains nearly perpendicular for some time, when a synclinal fold sets in on the north side of the pass, where the second small glacier is seen, on the map, to flow down from the north-west into the main ice stream. From this point the dip gradually flattens to a moderate south-west dip.\n\nThe rocks on the top of the pass are decidedly conglomeratic, but the included pebbles become more and more scarce the lower you descend, and the rocks pass into micaceous schists and fine-grained quartzites.\n\nThe eastern extension of the Silurian beds, the overlying conglomerate and associated thin beds of limestone have been traced by my friend, Dr. Hutchison, over the Chara and Cheni (Chaia) Passes, into the P\u00e1ngi Valley, and his observations have been incorporated in the accompanying map, which was published with my paper in the Records of the Geological Survey of India for the year 1885. He also traced the slates into L\u00e1hul, as far as Trilokn\u00e1th, where he saw numerous fallen blocks of the conglomerate. I will now revert again to the section over the S\u00e1ch Pass into the P\u00e1ngi Valley at Kil\u00e1r.\n\n(1) The conglomerate is seen in situ near the top of the Kalicho Pass, on the ascent from Trilokn\u00e1th. It was not found on the Chobis Pass.\nCHAMBA GAZETTEER.\n\nSection I through Dainkund and Tia to the Sich Pass.\n\nSection II through Dainkund Odapura, Huth, and Chanju.\n\nSection V. Section IV.

The limestone is subcrystalline, and is partly dark and partly pale-blue in colour, the latter weathering from a buff-cream to a brownish-buff.\n\nFrom this point the rocks are at first silicious schists and quartz-schists, often fissile, but never passing into true slates, and then succeed decided mica-schists, which continue until the gneissose-granite appears under the village of Pirgao, on the descent to the bridge over the S\u00e1ch stream.\n\nThe foliated granite seen in the P\u00e1ng\u00ed Valley is, when first seen, inter-bedded with the mica-chists which it conformably underlies, but gradually becomes more massive. I proceeded for several marches along the Chandra Bh\u00e1ga (Chem\u00e1b), but I had no opportunity of making traverses across the granite in a northerly direction. The impression left on my mind was that it very much resembled the rock termed \"Central Gneiss\" by Stoliczka, as seen in the Sutlej Valley, Spiti, and Upper L\u00e1hul, which is now accepted as an igneous intrusive rock.\n\nIn the P\u00e1ng\u00ed Valley the gneissic rock is cut by numerous dykes of white oligoclase granite, which pass up for some distance into the overlying schist, and reminds me much of the white intrusive dykes of granite in the gneissose-granite of the Upper Sutlej Valley. The gneissose-granite of the P\u00e1ng\u00ed Valley has yet to be worked out.\n\nI must now revert to the conglomerates seen on the road below the Padri Pass, which are succeeded, as above described, by some thin outcrops of pale-blue limestone, which may represent the Blaini limestones of the Simla region.\n\nProceeding across the strike the next rock to appear is an altered lava. A broad band of altered volcanic rock crops out near Duire, where it appears on the northern side of the Carbo-Triasie outcrop, and runs in a broad band in a north-westerly direction, along the ridge N. E. of Bh\u00e1ndal, to the high ridge which forms a boundary between Chamba territory and Badraw\u00e1r, beyond which I had no opportunity of tracing it. The western boundary of the trap runs a little to the east of the villages of Teloga, Baroga, Kaisura, and Chikotra.\n\nThe trap in the Bh\u00e1ndal-Duire (Dihur) area is followed by the conglomerate above described, which gives place to the Silurian beds.\n\nOn the southern margin of the Carbo-Triasie outcrop, between Duta and Dh\u00e1r, another band of trap is seen at the village of Bh\u00f3lu (not marked), and appears to extend in a north-westerly direction to near Sanaira, but has not been detected beyond this.\n\nFrom Bh\u00f3lu the trap strikes in a south-easterly direction, and runs past Chanena (not marked); and crossing the ridge west of\nHulh makes for Kail and Dila. It tops the ridge east of Hulh, above the village of Dhur, and then striking for Amraili crosses the Sao Valley, about three-quarters of a mile north of Sao. The outcrop here is about 200 to 250 yards wide.\n\nNumerous thin slices of the above outcrops have been studied under the microscope, and the rocks may be classed as altered basalts, andesites, felsites, basalt-porphyry, volcanic tuffs and ash, and hornblende andesites.\n\nSome of the slices contain amygdaloes filled with epidote, quartz, zeolites, and, in some cases, calcite. The two outcrops described above differ considerably in type from the altered basalts south of Dalhousie. They are more felspathic in character and contain a greater variety of lavas. In the traps north of Dalhousie we have volcanic ash and undoubted lavas, but they pass into other traps, such as the porphyritic basalts, which may possibly represent intrusions into the lava beds during their consolidation.\n\nIn the Chamba area I have come across many facts which show that our existing glaciers were, at a comparatively recent geological period, more extensive than they are now. I shall content myself with one or two instances by way of example.\n\nHalf-way between Sanoh and Parti in the Pangi Valley, and on the left bank of the Chandra Bhiga (Chenab), where the river pursues its way for some distance through a rather narrow gorge, the road is carried, at the level of about 100 feet above the river, by a sort of bridge made of poles, for 30 or 40 feet across a perfectly smooth rock that slopes down to the river at a high angle.\n\nThis rock, for a height of about 100 feet above the road, and down towards the river as far as the eye can trace, has been smoothed, polished, and grooved by an old glacier. The striations and grooves are well cut into the rock and are countless in number.\n\nThey run parallel to the surface of the river, with a somewhat greater \"fall\" than the bed of the stream, and occasionally some of them cross each other at a small angle.\n\nNo one who has seen the marks of recent glaciation, in Switzerland or elsewhere, could possibly mistake the evident signs of ancient glaciation here exhibited. The strata are perpendicular, and the strike is at right angles to the course of the stream.\n\nWe have at the spot indicated an interesting proof that, at no remote period, the glaciers of the Chandra and Bhiga Valleys must have vastly exceeded their present dimensions. These valleys were probably filled with confluent glaciers that flowed down into the Pangi Valley to a little below the point indicated, the elevation of which is about 7,500 feet above the sea.\nAbove the travellers' bungalow of Mamul, on the bridle-road to Dalhousie, at an elevation of 4,740 feet above the sea, there is a deposit which appears to have been the terminal moraine of a former glacier.\n\nIt consists of a mixture of boulders of various sizes of the granite of Dayankund, ranging up to blocks 12 feet long by 12 feet high, intermingled with fragments of schists and quartzites some of which are 8 feet in diameter, which represent strata between Mamul and Dayankund.\n\nThis deposit rests on the limestones and slates of the Carbo-Triassic series, and one cannot imagine that they simply slipped down the mountain side to their present resting place, insomuch as ridges and peaks intervene between it and the granite of Dayankund. A similar deposit is seen on a neighbouring spur opposite Mamul.\n\nIn the neighbourhood of Silunta, and between that village and Churri, there are large fragments of granite, ranging up to blocks containing about 13,050 cubic feet of granite, resting on the edges of spurs on the slopes of hills, and on deposits of mud in the valleys.\n\nThese boulders strongly suggest, at first sight, transport by ice, but as they are found at the low elevation of 2,900 feet above the sea, and on the very edge of the plains of India, it is antecedently improbable that glaciers can have come down as low as that.\n\nThe difficulty which at first presented itself to my mind was removed by observing that the actual eruption of granite, in the Silunta region, comes within three-quarters of a mile of the fringing deposits of the Upper Siwalik conglomerates. These blocks consequently had no great distance to travel. It is therefore more likely that the blocks of granite weathered out of their parent rock, as may be frequently observed on the top of granite hills, and gradually found their resting places by gravitation.\n\nHeavy rain may have aided their descent by wearing away the earth on the hill-sides on which they rested, and this process may also have been accelerated by falls of snow, which sometimes take place along the outer fringe of the Himalayas, and which have helped the blocks to slip down rocky slopes.\n\nThose who study such questions in the field must bear in mind that sub-aerial agencies may have considerably modified the contours of the hill-sides, since the blocks slipped down into their present positions, forming small valleys, and leaving ridges, where there may previously have been gentle slopes.\n\nIf we exclude from consideration the fringing zone of Tertiary Siwaliks, the newest rocks seen in the Chamba area are the limestones of the Carbo-Triassic series. The oldest rocks do not, I think, go below the Silurian system. In the Chamba area we have a consecutive series of these beds, and an unbroken succession of\nthem is well seen at Dalhousie along the cart road down to Banikhet. But in other parts of Chamba the successions seen on road-side sections are not always presented in their proper order, for the whole of the rocks in this area have been crumpled up into a series of crushed isoclinal folds, in which older beds are often folded up with those of younger age. This is particularly the case with the conglomerate described in the preceding pages. A most unusual thickness of this conglomerate is seen in the Chamba area, which can only be explained on the supposition that it has been thrown into a series of isoclinal folds. This idea is further supported by other facts. The conglomerate series is not uniformly conglomeratic, and the most probable explanation of this is that Silurian beds have been folded up with them. The dip also is very suggestive of crushed isoclinal folding: it is frequently high, often quite perpendicular, and where the planes are less inclined the dip changes rapidly from a south-west to a north-east direction.\n\nThe beds of the different systems are parallel to the granite and parallel to each other; but the outcrops of the beds are not of uniform width. When the strata were thrown into a series of folds by the severe tangential pressure which accompanied the rise of the Himalayas, the severity of the pressure evidently varied from point to point, the causes of which are too obscure to require demonstration here. But there is one obvious fact, the consideration of which may help us somewhat to understand what took place in this region. We must not suppose that when the rise of the Himalayas commenced the surface of the Earth's crust in the Chamba area was flat; on the contrary, there is every reason to believe that it was broken up into ocean-depths and mountain-ridges. When tangential pressure was applied to such beds, bearing an uneven superincumbent load, those under a great thickness of cover were naturally differently affected from beds under a thinner, and therefore lighter, cover. The latter beds would naturally become more upheaved; great faults would result; overthrust folds would be formed, and the phenomenon so commonly seen in the Himalayas would be produced, namely, the strata would be inverted, and older beds would appear to come in above those of really younger age.\n\nAnother result of the unequal effects of tangential pressure is that the sequence of beds at different points along the line of general strike is not exactly uniform. As an illustration of the above remarks, I would refer the reader to a few diagrammatic sections given on the accompanying plate. The directions in which these sections are taken are marked on the accompanying map by straight lines, each line bearing the same number as the corresponding section. These have already been published in the Records of the Geological Survey of India, Volume XVIII, and are here reproduced by permission of the Director.\nIn section I, through D\u00e1yankund to the S\u00e1ch Pass, we have a normal sequence of Silurian beds on both sides of the inner band of granite; but the conglomerates only appear on the northern side of the granite, separated from it by a thick band of Silurian strata, and followed by the Carbo-Triassic series. In this section the conglomerates have thus apparently been squeezed out on the south side of the granite during the folding of the strata. In this section also the volcanic series is not represented north of the granite zone.\n\nSection II differs from section I, inasmuch as a band of the volcanic series comes in on the south side of the Carbo-Triassic rocks, separating them from the conglomerates.\n\nIn sections III, IV, and V it will be seen that the Carbo-Triassic series is represented in IV and V, but does not appear in section III, whilst the volcanic series appears on the north side of the Carbo-Triassic strata in these sections instead of on the south side as shown in section II.\n\nTwo explanations may be offered for the disappearance of the Carbo-Triassic series from section III. It may have been squeezed out in a crushed synclinal fold, or the visible outcrops of this series may indicate the limits of its original deposition. The latter supposition is favoured by the fact, noted on a preceding page, that at both its western and eastern extremities the limestones become extremely earthy, suggesting an approach to the margins of the sea in which the limestones were laid down.\n\nThe discrepancy between the outcrops of the volcanic series is, I think, due to their belonging to different volcanic eruptions not completely synchronous, some eruptions preceding and others following the deposition of the limestones.\n\nSome remarks may now be offered on the important question of the age of the rocks described, of the intrusions of granite, and of the rise of the Him\u00e1layas, or, in other words, the crumpling up of the strata above described. No Silurian fossils have been discovered in the Chamba area; but the Simla slate series, which in that area is equally unfossiliferous have, by comparison with similar beds in other parts of the Him\u00e1layas, been regarded as Silurian in age. The conglomerate mentioned in the above pages was considered to be of Upper Silurian age, in deference to Dr. Stoliczka's verdict on the Muth series of Spiti, which he correlated with the Blaini series of the Simla area. Subsequently, the Blaini series was considered by other workers to be of Carboniferous age, owing to the resemblance which the Blaini conglomerates bear to the boulder beds of the Salt Range and Talchir series. Quite recently, however, my son, Major A. H. McMahon, and Major B. E. N. Gurdom discovered near Chitr\u00e1l a conglomerate, quartzite and limestone which bear a strong resemblance in their appearance, association and mode of occurrence to the typical Blaini series of the Simla area. In the limestone member of this series of Chitr\u00e1l\na number of fossils in an extremely good state of preservation were found, which have been carefully examined by Mr. W. H. Hudleston, F.R.S., and have been declared to be of Devonian age. If the suggestion, that the Chitr\u00e1l series represents the Blaini beds of the Simla area, should be confirmed by subsequent observers, the conglomerates of the Chamba area may be accepted as of Devonian age at the latest.\n\nI have mentioned in the preceding pages that crinoid stems are abundant in one of the beds of the Carbo-Triassic series in Chamba. Mr. Richard Lydekker formed the opinion, from the description of Mr. Bridges Lee, the first discoverer of these fossils, that the limestones in which they occur are not older than Carboniferous or younger than Trias.\n\nAs to the exact period in which the crumpling of the strata in the Chamba area took place, we have, I think, two limits in time for our guidance. The oldest limit is determined by the fact that Eocene marine beds are now found at an elevation of 20,000 feet in Zanskar. The youngest limit is determined by the fact that the Upper Siwalik strata in the Chamba area contain numerous boulders of granitoid gneiss, which were apparently derived from neighbouring outcrops of this rock, and to allow for the various secondary changes which have occurred in the gneissose-granite, I infer that its actual eruption must have occurred at the end of the Eocene or at the commencement of the Miocene period. The Dalhousie gneissose-granite, judged from the study of its microscopic characters, is not a rock of extreme abyssal type, but approaches more nearly to rocks which have been consolidated within a comparatively short distance from the surface. Considering, therefore, the great length, measured in years, of our geological periods, there seems to be sufficient time between the end of the Eocene period and the Upper Tertiary era for a rock of this character to be erupted, consolidated and exposed by denudation to the open air, where it would have given rise to the boulders now included in the Upper Siwalik conglomerates.\n\nAlthough I think the granites of the Chamba area belong to one age, it does not follow that they were necessarily erupted at precisely the same stage in the crumpling of the rocks. Indeed, I think there is some ground for regarding the outer band of granite, seen at Dalhousie, as slightly older than the inner band. The outer band, until it passes beyond the boundary of the Chamba State, is wonderfully uniform in its thickness, and does not seem to have been much affected in this respect by the extreme contortion which took place along the axis of the R\u00e1v\u00ed.\n\nThe beds above the outer band are bent as one might bend a green bough across one's knee, and the strain at this point, at the time of the eruption of the inner band of the granite, was so intense that the inner, and presumably younger, mass of molten material was so pinched that its outcrop suddenly dwindles from\na breadth of $6\\frac{1}{2}$ miles to a thickness of only 250 feet, and the corresponding foliation at the point of compression was more intense than at any other point along the outcrop.\n\nMr. H. B.

Thomson, 1843; Sir G. Watt, 1879), and valuable collections made by Messrs. Lace, Ellis and others. The outer Chamb\u00e9 Himalaya closely resembles that of Simla, but in Chamb\u00e9 a higher proportion of temperate zone forms reaches the exterior ranges; on the other hand, certain sub-tropical types, such as epiphytic orchids, find their western limit on the watershed between the R\u00e1v\u00ed basin and the Kangra Valley. From Sindh\u00e1ra (some 5,000 feet below the hill-station of Dalhousie) to the capital of Chamb\u00e9 the flora of the R\u00e1v\u00ed Valley hardly differs from that of the corresponding gorges of the Satlaj, or of the Chen\u00e1b in Jamnu. Trees and plants of European aspect are scarcely seen, while Indian forms predominate, such as the candlestick Euphorbia (often misnamed \"Cactus\"), the large taur climber (Bauhinia Vahlii), the am\u00falt\u00e1s or \"Indian Laburnum\" (Cassia Fistula), several thorny Acacias, the \"amla\" (Phyllanthus emblica), sundry species of Ficus, bamboos, a sub-tropical barberry, and the curious Prinsepia (behkar bekhi). Above 3,000 feet less tropical assemblages appear, woods of Pinus longifolia, with associated shrubs and herbs, often twiners; in places the wild olive (Olea cuspidata) occurs; while several kinds of clematis, a climbing rose and a tall azure-blossomed larkspur are abundant. At 6,000 feet oak coppice with the scarlet Rhododendron, Pieris (both of the heath order), Indigofera and Desmodium replace the pine woods. At K\u00e1l\u00e1tap (near Dalhousie) the mixed temperate forest is exemplified in great perfection, the characteristic firs and pines of the moist N.-W. Himalaya being mingled with holm-oaks, flowering-chestnuts, maples, hollies, elms, yew, Celtis, Euonymus and walnut, with an undergrowth of guelder roses (Viburnum), Staplyea, honeysuckles,\n\n(1) By Mr. J. B. Drummond, I.C.S.\nChamba State.\n\nFerns.\n\nSpireas, meadow-rues, Arisamas (cobra-plants), balsams and anemones, and large vines (Vitis and Hydrangea) mantling the stems and branches. There are fine cedar (Deodar) forests about Khajiar, and, where properly conserved, from 6,000 to 10,000 feet above sea-level; also in the valleys of the Chandrabhaga (Chenab) basin in Pangi; higher up the valley all conifers diminish rapidly, till in Chamba-Lahul patches of Pinus excelsa, scattered pencil cedars and juniper-scrub alone represent their family. At alpine levels on the upper Ravi, and in sheltered glens of the Chenab basin, birch, ash of two kinds, hazel and wild currants flourish; in Pangi towards the borders of Kashmir the hawthorn and wild gooseberry and the Pinus Gerardiana (edible pine) are frequent, also a species of wych-hazel (Parrotia Jacquemontiana) which gives its name (kil\u00e1r) to the chief place in the Valley.\n\nThroughout Chamba, from 7,000 feet above the sea to the limit of herbaceous vegetation, the smaller plants are, for the most part, allied to west-Asian or mid-European types, sometimes the actual species are identical; in the arid part of the Chenab basin mid-Siberian and Tibetan types are prominent; a Crambe allied to the English seakale, and a gigantic asphodel (Eremurus himalayicus) are striking plants in this region. There are few peculiar types; Sir G. Watt has described a Crowfoot (Ranunculus pangiensis) and an Arabis (A. bijuga), which, so far, have been found in Pangi exclusively. [T. Thomson, Western Himalaya and Tibet, 330-49; F. H. in Journ. of the Agri.-Hort. Soc. of Ind., Vol. V, Pt. III, N. S., p. 95; Watt, in Journ. of the Linn. Soc. (Botany, Vol. XVIII).]\n\nThis list has been compiled by Mr. J. C. McDonell, Imperial Forest Service, retired, who collected in the State during the years 1881 to 1888, when in charge of the forests; it is probable that other species have been found since then, as several collectors have visited this region in subsequent years, but as their information is not available the ferns are given as found by him, with such additions as have come under his notice. The Chamba State is rich in these non-flowering plants compared with the adjoining State of Kashmir, the number of species with varieties being 182, while Kashmir has probably not more than 80, but the latter number is open to correction. From the list it will be seen that the genus Asplenium is the richest, having no less than 22 species and varieties; Polypodium and Nephrodium come next with 19 and 18. One of the most interesting species is Athyrium McDonelli, a single plant of which was first discovered by the compiler of this list, in 1882, in the Chadbhent Nala, and, though searched for, it was not again found till he went to Kashmir in 1891. So far as he is aware it has not been traced in Chamba, though it is common in the Kashmir Valley at an elevation of from five to six thousand feet.\nThe nomenclature in the list is that of Beddome's Handbook and Supplement:\n\n| No. | Name                                      | Remarks                          |\n|-----|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n|     | **Tribe Dicksonia.**                      |                                  |\n| 1   | Woodsia elongata (H.

In the higher ranges, near the snow line, are to be found the snow leopard or ounce, the ibex, the marmot, the ermine weasel, and the hill fox. At somewhat lower elevations live the red bear, the tahr, and the musk deer. Below them are the black bear, leopard, g\u00faral, sarao, hy\u00e6na, lang\u00far and Rhesus monkeys, pine martens, wild-cat, flying squirrel; while near Barnota, on the borders of Bhadraw\u00e1h, there is a small herd of Kashmir stags (b\u00e1ras\u00edngha), which is closely preserved by His Highness. In the lower valleys there are the jackal, barking deer (munjuc) and wild pig; and on the banks of the R\u00e1v\u00ed otters are fairly numerous.\n\nWhile I was in Chamba I observed two hundred-and-sixty five species of birds. There are six kinds of pheasants: the mon\u00e1l or n\u00edlgur (lophophorus impeyanus), the horned pheasant or fulgar (ceriornis melanocephala); the kokl\u00e1s or kukrola (pucrasia macrolopha); the ch\u00e9r or chiman (phasianus Wallichii); the kalij or kolsa (euplocamus albochristatus), and the snow pheasant or galaund (tetraogallus Himalayensis). The chakor or chukru (raccabis chukor) is common throughout the State, extending beyond the snow line into P\u00e1ngi. The lerwa or biju (lerwa nivicola) is to be found in packs along the first snowy range, but does not appear to go north of the Chen\u00e1b. There is only one species of wood-partridge, the R\u00e1m chakru (arboricola Torquedla), which is found in the forests where the horned pheasant and kokl\u00e1s live. The peacock or mohr (pavo cristatus) and black partridge or k\u00e1la tit\u00e1r\n\n---\n\n(1) By Colonel C. H. T. Marshall, late Superintendent o C\n(Francolinus vulgaris) are to be found in the lower reaches of the R\u00e1vi Valley. The grey quail (coturnix communis) is only a passenger through the State, but stays sometimes for a fortnight or month in April en route to the breeding places. The woodcock or chinjarol (scolopax rusticola) breeds in thickets at an elevation of ten or eleven thousand feet. They only come down to the Chamba Valley when driven from their haunts by snow, but never stay longer at the lower levels than is absolutely necessary. During one severe winter 66 were shot in and around the town of Chamba.\n\nThe solitary snipe (gallinago solitaria) and the woodsnipe (g. nemoricola) breed in the higher ranges, but do not appear to come down to the valleys as the woodcock does. Several species of wild duck pass through in the spring and autumn; they very seldom rest in the R\u00e1vi Valley on their way up to the lakes where they breed, but numbers stay for a day, on a marsh near the town, when returning to the plains. Specimens of seven species have been obtained. The geese never stay on their journey up or down. Ten species of the columbidae occur. The two found furthest north are the snow pigeon or bajal (columba leuconota) which lives up among the snows with the galaund, the lerwa, the rose-finch, and the chough, and the blue rock (c. rupestris), which breeds in P\u00e1ngi in the precipitous cliffs overhanging the Chen\u00e1b. The Himalayan woodpigeon (palumbus casiotis) is fairly common: these and the snow pigeons come down in very large flocks in the winter about the town. The kokla (sphenocercus sphenurus) and the four common species of doves (turtur) are found within the limits of the State.\n\nNumerous species occur of the Raptore or birds of prey. The great Lammergeyer (Gypactus burtatus), which measures nine feet across the wings, is common, as also are the four vultures that are seen in the plains, and the Himalayan vulture or bara gid. The goshawk (astur palumbarius), which is valued for sporting purposes, breeds in the higher forests; these birds are caught in the autumn in nets baited with live pigeons, and a female, which is most prized for hawking, fetches from Rs. 50 to 80. The male is called jurra and the female b\u0101z. There are two species of falcon, and two of sparrow-hawks. The golden eagle or muriori (aquila chrysaetus), may be met with in the interior: a reward is placed on its head, as it plays havoc among pheasants in the breeding season. This eagle is used for hawking wild sheep in Y\u00e1rkand: it is carried in the chase on a pole held by two men on horseback. There are also the crested and the serpent eagles; the buzzard buteo (plumipes), the common kite, four kinds of large, and five of small owls. The calls of the latter are peculiar: the Scops owl sounds like chok chuk, chuk chok. This and the double whistle of the pigmy owlet are heard in all the forests in the summer months.\n\nNine species of swallows and swifts, called charairi by the natives, and three of nightjars (caprimulgus) occur: the weird dismal cries of the latter, like the sound of a stone skidding along\nice, are heard all the night through in June and July, about Dalhousie and Khaj\u00e1r. There is a pair of pied kingfishers, or *jil bul\u00e1ra*, about every ten or twelve miles along the larger streams in the interior; they breed in holes in precipitous banks over waterfalls. The kingfisher of the plains is only an occasional visitor.\n\nAmong other birds to be found in Chamba are two kinds of parrots, eight of woodpeckers, the wryneck, two barbets, four cuckoos, one of which (*cuculus Himalayensis*) has a most peculiar call; he sits with his long tail erect and throat puffed out, and booms out deep notes, something between the notes of the hoopoo and the green pigeon. The *nuthat-l*, tree creeper, sun bird, and hoopoo are fairly common. Seven kinds of shrikes come in the summer and breed in the R\u00e1vi Valley. Of the thrush family there are twenty distinct species. The golden orioles, stonechats, winchats, redstarts (six species), tom-tits (four species), nutcrackers, jays, magpies (four species), buntings (four species), sparrows (four species), starlings (five species), siskins, bulbuls (three species), wrens, warblers (thirteen species), and flycatchers all find a home in one part or another of Chamba. Up among the snows live the Alpine chough and the beautiful rose-finch.\n\nOn the banks of the streams the traveller sees the water ouzel, whiteheaded redstart, blue whistling thrush, pied kingfisher, spotted fork tail, and the little fork tail. Five kinds of grey and yellow wagtails arrive in Chamba Valley in February, but by the end of March they have all departed. In August one year I saw a number of grey wagtails (*motacilla alba* and *melanope*) on a stony plain near the top of the S\u00e1ch Pass (14,328 feet). The most beautiful birds in the forests are the scarlet and black minivets. The hen-birds are yellow and grey; the young males are the same colour as the females, and in the spring time interesting specimens may be obtained in the transition stage, when the yellow feathers are turning orange and red, and grey ones gradually becoming black. The naturalist will also find six kinds of pipit, the grosbeak, bullfinch, and goldfinch common in parts. Lastly, of the water birds and waders, he can obtain three species of the water pheasant or Jacana, two kinds of coot, the grey heron, the bittern, the little grebe, two terns and two cormorants.\n\nShooting is not allowed within the limits of the Chamba State without a license. Licenses are current for the calendar year and are limited in number. Applications for licenses to shoot should be addressed to the Private Secretary to His Highness the R\u00e1ja of Chamba, and should be accompanied by the prescribed fee. The fee at present is Rs. 10 for a license to cover the shooting of small game, and Rs. 25 for a license to cover the shooting of large and small game. Sportsmen wishing to shoot within the Chamba State should apply to the Private Secretary to the R\u00e1ja for a copy of the Rules on the subject.\nSnakes are numerous in the lower valleys and the most poisonous are the *kha'pa* (cobra), *sankhchor*, and *ratir*; of the less poisonous kinds the principal are, *bai's*, *sotar* and *nag*. The *sotar* is of uniform thickness and is believed to have a mouth at each end, and is therefore called *domunha*. It is not very poisonous and any one bitten by it will, according to popular belief, be bitten again once every year. The *nag* is a whitish-coloured snake that frequents the walls of houses and is said to drink milk. *P\u00faja* and incense are offered to it, and its presence is regarded as a good omen.\n\nThere is good fishing in the *R\u00e1v\u00ed* and its larger tributaries. The *mah\u00e1sir* is caught below the capital; other fish are the *khikhya'r*, *galdi*, *dogru*, *gaddan* and *jappe*. The *khikhya'r* is a large fish, the others are small. Fishing is usually done with the net, but also with the hook. There are said to be no fish in the Chandrabh\u00e1g\u00e1 in State territory.\n\nAs the State is wholly mountainous, with altitudes ranging from 2,000 to 21,000 feet, every variety of climate is found within its borders from the semi-tropical to the semi-arctic. In the lower parts of the Bhattiyat *wizarat*, most of which is in the Be\u00e1s Valley, the climatic conditions are similar to those of Kangra and the general Siwalik area. Being for the most part at a low altitude, ranging from 2,000 to 3,000 feet, the heat in summer is intense though less than that of the plains. The rainy season is heavy and prolonged, while the winters are pleasant and equable, with only a moderate degree of variation between the day and night temperatures. Snow seldom falls, but in severe winters it occasionally reaches as low as 2,000 feet. In the higher portions of the Bhattiyat *wizarat*, adjoining the high range, the climate is temperate, the rainfall in this region is very heavy, and in winter snow lies for some months to a considerable depth on the spurs from the high range, as well as on the main range itself.\n\nIn the *R\u00e1vi* Valley the climatic conditions vary with the altitude. In the lower portion of the valley, from the capital downwards, they are of a semi-tropical character. The heat is great, and the rainy season well marked, while the winter is mild, and the snowfall light. In the capital the maximum temperature recorded is 108.5\u00b0 and the minimum 30.3\u00b0; the mean maximum 77.7\u00b0 and the mean minimum 56.5\u00b0; range 21.2\u00b0; mean humidity 60\u00b0; and mean cloud amount 5\u00b0. From the capital upwards the conditions are more severe, and vary from the temperate to the semi-arctic. Arctic conditions prevail along the high ranges for several months in winter, and the passes are then blocked with snow. In the Bhalmaur *wizarat* the summer is mild, but the winter is severe.\n\nIn the Chandrabh\u00e1g\u00e1 Valley the climate is temperate in summer, and semi-arctic in winter. As the lowest altitude in the P\u00e1ngi Valley is 7,000 feet, no great heat is felt. The summer is exceedingly mild and pleasant, while owing to the scanty rainfall...\nthe degree of humidity is always low. The winter, however, is very severe. Snow commences to fall in October, but does not lie permanently till December, after which the whole valley is under snow till March or April. All communication with the outer world is then cut off, and intercourse is difficult even between the centres of population in the valley.\n\nThe only available statistics are for the capital, where the maximum yearly rainfall recorded is 80\u00b741 inches; the minimum 33\u00b772 inches; and the yearly average 49\u00b773 inches. The major portion of the rainfall is deposited during the summer months from June to September; the average being 25\u00b734 inches, while the average between January and May is 20\u00b775 inches. The remaining months of the year, from October to December, show an average of only 8\u00b764. The fall is heaviest on the Dhauila Dhar and Pangi Ranges. In Dalhousie the maximum is 143\u00b730 inches, and the minimum 52\u00b757 inches, with a yearly average of 86\u00b735 inches.\n\nNo statistics are available for the separate wiz\u0101rats. In Bhattiyat, south of the Dhauila Dh\u00e1r, the rains are heavy, and the R\u00e1vi Valley also receives a fair proportion of moisture; the lowest average probably being in the Br\u00e1hmaur wiz\u0101rat. Owing to the great altitude of the Pangi Range the rain clouds deposit most of their contents on its southern slopes, and only a scanty supply reaches the Chandrabh\u00e1ga Valley, which falls in light showers, chiefly in July and August. The yearly average is probably not more than 25 inches. At Kailung in British L\u00e1hul the maximum annual rainfall, including snow, is 38\u00b779 inches, the minimum 14\u00b751 inches; and the yearly average 23\u00b720 inches.\n\nIn the R\u00e1vi floods are common during the rains, and bridges are often damaged or washed away, but little harm is ever done to cultivation. In the Chandrabh\u00e1ga floods occur in spring. During winter the river is low and clear and usually frozen over, while great banks of snow are piled up in the narrow parts of the gorge. These begin to break up with the rise of the river, on the approach of summer, and may suddenly yield to the pressure of the great volume of water above them. The same result may follow when a landslip, which has partially or completely dammed up the current, suddenly gives way. In Pangi and L\u00e1hul the rainy season is so light that it has little effect on the volume of the river.\n\nEarthquakes are of frequent occurrence. The most severe and destructive in living memory was that of 4th April 1905, which caused great damage to property, especially in Br\u00e1hmaur, but happily without much loss of life.\nSection B.\u2014History.\n\nChamb\u00e1, sheltered by its snow-clad mountain barriers, has had the rare fortune of escaping the successive waves of Moslem invasions which, in the Plains of the Punjab, have swept away all monuments of old-Indian civilisation. The result is that in this petty Hill State ancient remains are more abundant and better preserved than in any other part of the Province. In Kashmir the proud temples of Lalitaditya and his successors were ruthlessly destroyed by Sikandar Butshikan; in that centre of Sanskrit learning only a few poor fragments of inscriptions have come to light. In Chamb\u00e1 the brazen idols of Meru-varman, nearly contemporaneous with the temple of Martand, still stand in their ancient shrines of carved cedar wood. Copper-plate grants issued by the early rulers of Chamb\u00e1, whose names figure in the Rajatarangini, are still preserved by the descendants of the original donees, who enjoy the granted lands up to the present day. Chamb\u00e1, the oldest of the very few Hill States which have survived the turbulent days of Sikh ascendancy, is not only a store-house of antiquities, but is in itself a relic of the past, invaluable to the student of India's ancient history.\n\nThe ancient remains of Chamb\u00e1 first drew the attention of the pioneer of Indian Archaeology\u2014Sir Alexander Cunningham. His visit, however, was too short to do full justice to the subject. In two notes inserted in his Archaeological Reports he gives an account of the principal temples in Chamb\u00e1 Town, and in the ancient capital, Brahmaur. He notices particularly the inscriptions of Meru-varman in Brahmaur and Chhatr\u0101rhi, and treats briefly of three copper-plate grants and one stone inscription found in the town. The oldest and most important of these three plates was subsequently edited and fully discussed by Professor Kielhorn of the Goettingen University.\n\nThe whole wealth of antiquarian, especially epigraphical material has, however, only come to light during the last five years. Prolonged tours through the different parts of Chamb\u00e1, including the Chandrabh\u00e1g\u0101 Valley, have enabled me to inspect the many ancient temples and to collect some hundred and fifty inscriptions, ranging from the 6th to the 17th centuries. These will be made the subject of a separate publication of the Archaeological Survey of India.\n\nThe numerous ancient temples of Chamb\u00e1 State are of two distinct types which may conveniently be designated as Hill temple and Plains temple. The latter, entirely built of stone and usually decorated with carvings, is the well-known Hindu temple.\n\n---\n\n(1) By J. Ph. Vogel, Ph. D., Superintendent, Archaeological Survey, Northern Circle.\n(2) Archaeological Survey Reports, Vol. XIV, pp. 109 ff., and Vol. XXI, pp. 134 ff.; also Ancient Geography p. 141.\n(3) Indian Antiquary, Vol. XVII, 1859, p. 7 ff.\nof the Plains with its conical spire (shikhara), from which it is technically denoted as shikhara or spired temple. For a description of this type I may refer to Fergusson's standard work on Indian Architecture.(1) The temples in Chamb\u00e1 Town belong all to this type with the exception of that of Ch\u00e1mund\u00e1. They consist of a single cella in which the image is placed, and have no ante-room (mandapa) as, for instance, is found in the Baijn\u00e1th Temple, in the K\u00e1ngra District.(2) They are entered through an ornamental porch usually supported by two pillars. A peculiar feature of the shikhara temples, in Chamb\u00e1 and other hill tracts, is the umbrella-shaped covering of wood or zinc placed over and around the amalaka stone which forms the top of the spire. This awkward excrescence serves the useful purpose of protecting the building against heavy snow-fall, and would alone suffice to show that the shikhara temple originated in the Plains, and was introduced in the Hills at a comparatively late date. This we may also conclude from the circumstance that the Vishnu temples all belong to this type, whilst the shrines dedicated to a Dev\u00ed or N\u00e1ga are all Hill temples. For there is reason to assume that the Dev\u00ed and N\u00e1ga worship represents the original cult of the Hills, whereas Vishnuism was introduced in the 10th century.\n\nThe chief temple of Chamb\u00e1, that of Lakshmi-N\u00e1r\u00e1yan, with its image of white marble, was founded at that time; but it is impossible to decide how far the present building represents the original shrine. We know at least of one restoration by R\u00e1j\u00e1 Part\u00e1p Singh. Two copper-plate inscriptions issued by this ruler, in A.D. 1582, mention that the temple was consecrated,(3) whence we may infer that the restoration amounted to a complete renovation of the building. One plate mentions also the Chandragupta Temple which belongs to the same group. It is a linga shrine, likewise ascribed to S\u00e1hilla, the founder of Chamb\u00e1. Between these two temples there is a modern temple dedicated to R\u00e1dh\u00e1-Krishn\u00e1 by S\u00e1dha, the R\u00e1ni of R\u00e1j\u00e1 J\u00edt Singh. According to an inscription in the vernacular it was consecrated in the Vikrama year 1882, i.e., A.D. 1825. The three remaining temples of this group are that of Gauri-Shankar containing a well-modelled brass image of Shiva and his spouse, the Trimukh linga temple and that of Lakshmi-D\u00e1modar. Consequently three out of these six temples are dedicated to Vishnu and three to Shiva.\n\nThere are two more Vishnu temples of the shikhara type in Chamb\u00e1 Town. Earliest in date is that of Hari R\u00e1\u00ed, profusely decorated with carvings, but unfortunately crammed between the clumsy Chaug\u00e1n Gate and an unsightly goods-shed. Its founda-\n\n(1) History of Indian and Eastern Architecture, London, 1890, pp. 221 ff.\n(2) The six temples near the Palace have been provided with small pavilions built on against the fa\u00e7ade; but these are modern additions, which in reality formed no part of the original building.\n(3) One of these plates commences:\u2014Shr\u00ed samvat 58 Baish\u00e1kh prav\u00edshe 9 Shri bare N\u00e1rd-yane de dehre prat\u00edteh hoi.\ntion by Salakara-varman is mentioned in a copper-plate inscription of the 11th century.\n\nThe other temple, that of Bensi Gopal, in the vicinity of the Palace, is of a much later date. In a copper-plate of Raj Bhabhada, of A.D. 1595, mention is made of the consecration of a temple of Gopal, which presumably is the one in question, as no other temple of this name is known to exist in the town.\n\nFinally, we must note two shikhara temples dedicated to Devi. That of Vajreshvar or Bhagayati outside the town is remarkable for its fine sculptures. The short inscriptions under the niches seem merely to contain the names of the artisans employed in the construction of the building, but give no certain clue to its date. The temple of Champavati on the north side of the Chaugin contains a stone image of Durga slaying the Buffalo-demon. In the court-yard of this temple we note a dilapidated shrine of small size which shelters the images of Vasuki Naga (or Baski Nag) and his wazir. Originally the Naga king had a more spacious residence, which was destroyed by fire in the year 1898. Since then he has found a refuge with the Devi.\n\nThe shikhara temples beyond those in the town are very few in number. At Brahmaur, the ancient capital, there are two buildings of this type. The larger of the two is dedicated to Shiva under the name of Mani-mahes. It is ascribed to Meru-varman, who reigned about A.D. 700, but it is very doubtful whether the present building goes back to so remote a time. This much is certain, that the erection of a Shiva temple by Meru-varman is recorded in an inscription on the brass bull which stands in front of the temple.\n\nThe other shikhara temple of Brahmaur, smaller in size and plainer in appearance, contains a brass image of Narasingh, the Man-lion incarnation of Vishnu. Its erection by Rani Tribhuvanarekha is mentioned in a copper-plate inscription of Yugakarana, the son of Sahilla, and may, therefore, be placed in the 10th or 11th century. The Narasingh Temple suffered considerable damage in the earthquake of the 4th April 1905.\n\nA stone temple of a peculiar type is that of Chandrashekhar (Sanskrit Chandra-shekhar) the Moon-crowned Shiva, at Saho. It is surmounted by a sloping slate roof, evidently of modern date. The two remarkable figures, however, on both sides of the entrance bear out that the body of the building is ancient. We shall see in the sequel that an early Sharadi inscription, discovered at the adjoining village of Sarahan, presumably records the foundation of the Saho Temple.\n\nThe small shikhara temple at Udaipur, 3 miles below Chambal, is a specimen of a very late type, as it was erected after the\n\nThe passage reads:\u2014Shri Divine Gopala ra deha pratishtha Kirti.\ndeath of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Udai Singh, which occurred in A.D. 1720. It contains three small-size images of white marble. The central one represents N\u00e1r\u00edyana, the other two R\u00e1j\u00e1 Udai Singh and his brother Lachman Singh, who were murdered near the spot where the temple stands. Besides, there is a slab with the effigies of the R\u00e1j\u00e1, and his four R\u00e1n\u00eds and eighteen maid-servants who became sat\u00ed after his demise. This slab corresponds with the so-called sat\u00ed pillars of Mandi and Kullu. It is the only instance of its kind met with in Chamb\u00e1. There are, however, scattered all over the State, stones with one or two rudely-carved figures. These are known as autar stones (autar from Sanskrit aputra meaning \"sonless\"), and were erected by the relatives of a man who had died without leaving male descendants to perform the shraddha. The circumstance that R\u00e1j\u00e1 Udai Singh died sonless led to the founding of the Udaipur temple, and the slab it contains evidently serves the purpose of an autar stone.\n\nIn the Chandrabh\u00e1g\u00e1 Valley only one temple of the shikhara type is found. It is the famous sanctuary of Trilokn\u00e1th \u201cthe lord of the three worlds,\u201d which is another name for Avalokiteshvara, the popular Bodhisattva.(1) It is probably, with the Bodhi temple at Gaya, the only Buddhist shrine in India which has remained Buddhist up to the present day. It contains a six-armed image of white marble. One right hand is in the gift-bestowing attitude, one of the left hands holds a lotus, the typical attribute of this Bodhisattva; on his head he wears the effigy of his spiritual father, the Buddha of Boundless Light, Amit\u00e1bha. The officiating priest is a lama appointed by the R\u00e1na of Trilokn\u00e1th who, though professing the Hindu religion, acts as the manager of the temple. Trilokn\u00e1th is, indeed, equally worshipped by the Buddhists of L\u00e1hul, Lad\u00e1kh and Zangskar, and by the Hind\u00fas of the neighbouring hill tracts. It is of special interest to note that the Trilokn\u00e1th Temple has a purely Indian type and must, therefore, be regarded as a monument of Indian Buddhism. It is curious that it is still known by the name of Bih\u00e1r, a derivation of Sanskrit Vih\u00e1ra.\n\nThe body of the temple is built of stone, the spire or shikhara of small partly-moulded bricks. The porch, supported by two graceful pillars with fluted shafts, is profusely adorned with carvings. Unfortunately the appearance of the edifice has been completely spoiled owing to its having been encased in a clumsy, shed-like structure, which forms an anteroom in front, and at the same time provides a procession-path round the temple. The whole has more-over been thickly white-washed so as to conceal the traces of decay. Engaged in the modern outer wall are two miniature shikhara temples in which a number of wooden masks are preserved. At the death of a member of the R\u00e1na\u2019s family such a mask is prepared\n\n(1) Cf. My note Trilokn\u00e1th, Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, Vol. LXX (1903), Part I, pp. 1 ff.\nand placed in the temple, from whence it is on no account to be removed. An exception is made for three masks which are used at the Ch\u00e1ri or Spring festival, and are said to represent a man, a woman and a demon, called in the local dialect g\u00e1mi, m\u00e9zmi and kulinza. The main substance of the Ch\u00e1ri festival is a performance symbolising the advent of Spring and the defeat of Winter. The latter, personified as an evil demon, is represented by the bearer of the kulinza mask, who is chased by the joint villagers and pelted with snow balls till he retires from the village and drops his mask, after which he joins in a dance with the gami and m\u00e9zmi mask-bearers. There is evidently no connection whatever between this festival and the cult of Avalokiteshvara. The annual fair in honour of this deity, which takes place on the last of S\u00e1wan, is likewise attended with ancient rites and sacrifices of an aboriginal type, which strangely contrast with the character of the Great Compassionate of Buddhism.\n\nThe number of shikhara temples in Chamb\u00e1 State, leaving aside the miniature ones, does not exceed fourteen (ten of which are found in the town), but it would be difficult to count those of the Hill type, which are scattered everywhere along the mountain slopes and in the valleys. Their construction is extremely simple. They consist of a small cella, usually raised on a square plinth, and built of layers of rubble masonry alternating with beams of cedar wood. This is surmounted by a sloping roof of slates or wooden shingles supported by wooden posts, which form a verandah or procession-path round the shrine. Of the high pagoda-like roof met with in Kashmir, Kul\u00e1 and Nepal no instances are found in Chamb\u00e1. It is possible that some temples, e.g., that at Chhatr\u00e1rhi, originally had a roof of this kind. Owing to climatic conditions the roofs of these buildings have often to be renewed. It must, however, be admitted that they are well calculated to shelter the shrine against the heavy rain and snow-fall peculiar to the hills. Though simple in their architecture, some of these Hill temples are of great interest owing to the elaborate decoration of their fa\u00e7ades, ceilings and pillars.\n\nChamb\u00e1 can boast of three such temples adorned with the finest wood-carving found in the Alpine Panj\u00e1b. They are the temples of Laksham\u00e1, at Brahmaur; that of Shakti, at Chhatr\u00e1rhi; and that of K\u00e1li, at Mirkula or Udaipur in L\u00e1hul. It will be noticed that these three are all dedicated to Dev\u00ed. The Brahmaur and Chhatr\u00e1rhi temples can be approximately dated; for they contain brass images with inscriptions which record their erection by Meruvarman, and on account of their character may be assigned to about A.D. 700. I have little doubt that the images are contemporaneous with the temples in which they are enshrined. It should be remembered that the timber used for these buildings is the wood of the Him\u00e1layan cedar or deod\u00e1r (Cedrus deodara) which, if well seasoned, is one of the most durable timbers existing.\nThe carvings which are exposed to the weather, e.g., those on the fa\u00e7ade of the Lakshana Temple, are now much decayed, but wherever sheltered they exhibit an excellent state of preservation. This point is especially conspicuous in the carved capitals of the Shakti Temple.\n\nThe plan of the Lakshana Temple differs from that described above, in that in front of the shrine we find an ante-room, the two being enclosed within a solid wall of rubble and wood masonry which has replaced the verandah. The fa\u00e7ade of this building is of particular interest, as in the style of its decoration it exhibits a close affinity to the architecture of Kashmir and Gandhara, and, indeed, shows traces of classical influence peculiar to the monuments of the North-West. Under the ridge-beam of the roof we notice first of all the triangular pediment with the trifoiled arch, a characteristic feature of the Kashmir temples. The seated figure in the arch is not Kali, as supposed by Cunningham, but Surya the sun-god, as is evident from the position of the legs. His twelve arms, holding various attributes, are presumably indicative of the twelve months of the year. The seven crouching figures along the basis of the triangle probably represent the seven days of the week.\n\nHere, as well as on the architraves between the pediment and the doorway, we find an arrangement frequent in the Graeco-Buddhist art of Gandhara; rows of figures in arched niches, separated by dwarf pilasters. In the lowermost row the figures are amatory couples which can be traced back to Graeco-Buddhist examples. We notice also a row of supporting, crouching figures frequently met with in Gandhara sculpture and corresponding to the Atlantes of classical art.\n\nThe ornamentation on the lintels and jambs of the door-way is of a purely Indian type. Over the entrance we find a double row of garland-carrying flying figures, presumably meant for Gandharvas. In the upper row each of these figures is accompanied by a female figure seated on its hip. Along the jambs standing figures are placed which are difficult to identify owing to their decayed state. On both sides of the threshold the river goddesses Ganga and Yamuna (i.e. the Ganges and Jamna) are still recognisable, each holding a water-vessel and a lotus-stalk, and standing on their vehicles the crocodile (makara) and the tortoise. Finally, I wish to draw attention to the winged dragons rampant which adorn the upper corners of the door-way.\n\nThe temple of Shakti Devi at Chhatrarihi which, as we saw, belongs to the same period as that of Lakshana, is a good specimen of the Hill shrine described above. The outer doorway, however,\n\n---\n\n(1) For a reproduction see Annual Report of the Archaeological Survey, 1892-93, Plate XXXIV n.\n(2) Cf. Foucher, L'art gr\u00e9co-bouddhique du Gandhara (Paris 1916), figures 84-87 and 102.\nis evidently a later addition, and the coarse frescoes on the walls of the cells are of quite recent date. The ornamentation of the inner door-way is very similar to that of the Lakshmi Temple. Here also we find, over the entrance, a row of flying figures\u2014four on each side\u2014the two in the centre carrying a crown, whereas the remaining six are accompanied by female figures each seated on the hip of its companion. Beneath these there is a row of thirteen cross-legged figures, of which nine represent the Nava-grahas, i.e., the Sun, the Moon, the five planets\u2014Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus and Saturn\u2014the eclipse-demon Rahu and the comet Ketu. Rahu is represented by a demon's head without a body, in agreement with the myth told in the Puranas. It is said that Rahu stealthily partook of the nectar (amrita) produced by the churning of the ocean, but was betrayed by the Sun and the Moon, who had noticed the theft. He was beheaded by Vishnu, but the head had become immortal by the use of the nectar. Since then the Rahu's head persecutes the Sun and the Moon and causes them to eclipse. The four remaining figures at the two ends possibly represent the Guardians of the Four Regions (Lokapalas).\n\nAlong the door-jambs we find a double row of standing figures on each side of the entrance. Those of the two outer rows alternate with crouching animal-headed figurines, which act as Atlantes, and presumably are meant either for Rakshasas or for the Ganas of Shiva. Among the standing figures we notice to the right the six-faced Karttikeya with his peacock, and Indra the rain-god holding a thunderbolt (vajra) and accompanied by his vehicle the elephant (Airavata); and to the left the four-armed Brahma, carrying a rosary and a water-pot and accompanied by a pair of geese. The inner rows consist each of four figures. On the left side we recognise Vishnu three-faced, the side faces being a lion's and a boar's; and Durgi slaying the Buffalo-demon (Mahishasura). The two lowermost figures are again Ganga and Yamuna, the personifications of the sacred rivers of India. In the upper corners of the door-way we notice the same winged dragons as are found on the Lakshmi Temple.\n\nThe wooden pillars, with their pot-and-foliage capitals, supporting elaborately carved bracket-capitals in which couchant bulls and other animals have been introduced, deserve special notice.\n\nThe temple of Kali, commonly called Mirkula Devi from the name of the village where it is found, is of unknown age. The image of the goddess, a small brass idol of inferior workmanship, is inscribed with a Takari inscription, which shows it to belong to a late period, perhaps the 13th or 14th century. But I have little doubt that the temple in which it is enshrined is earlier than the image. The popular tradition that the Mirkula temple and that of Hidimb\u00e9 at Manali in Kulu were wrought by the same artisan\n\nCf. Annual Report of the Archaeological Survey, 1902-03, Plate XXXIV.\nCHAMBA STATE.] Hill temples. [PART A.\n\nCHAP I. B. deserves no credit. The Man\u00e1li temple with its profuse but crude wood-carvings was built by order of Bah\u00e1dur Singh of Kul\u00fa in A.D. 1559. The temple of Mirkula Dev\u00ed must be centuries older. On the other hand it cannot be denied that its decoration does not reach the excellence of that on the Lakshan\u00e1 and Shakti temples. It evidently belongs to some intermediate period, perhaps the 10th or 11th century. The wood-carving of the Panj\u00e1b Hills exhibits, perhaps more than any other branch of Indian Art, a constant deterioration. Modern work is indeed so clumsy as to appear primitive.\n\nThe Mirkula temple, like that of Lakshan\u00e1 Dev\u00ed, has an anteroom or mandapa in front of the shrine proper, and a solid wall enclosing both. It is surmounted by a high conical roof. It would be impossible here to give an adequate description of the wood-carvings which cover the fa\u00e7ade of the shrine and the ceiling of the mandapa. The central panel of the latter, with its magnificent lotus rosette enclosed within a vajra border, is similar in construction and partly in design to the ceiling of the Pandrethan temple in Kashmir. It is not a little curious to find, on one of the other panels of the ceiling, a representation of the temptation of Buddha by M\u00e1ra, the Evil One; a subject which one would scarcely expect to meet in a shrine of the blood-thirsty K\u00e1l\u00ed. In the centre the Sh\u00e1kya Sage is seated impassible alike to the charms of M\u00e1ra's daughters and to the onslaught of his dreadful host. To the left is M\u00e1ra, standing on a chariot drawn by dragons, shooting an arrow at Buddha. To the right we see him again on the same chariot after his attack has failed. His two daughters support him, while bow and arrow are dropping from his hands and the animals attached to his chariot have fallen into disorder. Of the remaining carvings I wish only to note scenes from the Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1rata and R\u00e1m\u00e1yana on the architraves. Two panels on both sides of the window represent the Churning of the Ocean and Vishnu's Dwarf (V\u00e1mana) incarnation. Conspicuous in the latter is the figure of Vishnu who, having assumed his divine shape, bestrides the Universe in three steps.\n\nOf the other numberless village temples, mostly dedicated to a Dev\u00ed or N\u00e1ga, the only one which deserves a passing notice is that of Ch\u00e1mund\u00e1, at Dev\u00ed K\u00f3th\u00ed, on account of the Mughal influence manifest in its wood-carvings. It was built by Umed Singh in A.D. 1754. The same influence is observable in some profane buildings of that period, e.g., the State K\u00f3twhi Brahmaur, ascribed to R\u00faj\u00e1 Prithvi Singh, which was destroyed in the earthquake of the 4th April 1905. Specimens of modern wood-carving, as far removed from the old work in merit as in time, may be seen at Mindhal, opposite S\u00e1ch, on the temple of Ch\u00e1mund\u00e1 (commonly called Mindhal Dev\u00ed), and on the little N\u00e1ga temple near Kil\u00e1r.\n\nBefore leaving the monuments, I wish to note the footprint pillars or p\u0101d\u016bkas which the traveller in Chamb\u00e1 will notice in\ngreat number in front of village temples or at the road-side. They consist of a pile of stones covered by a flat slab, on which a trident (tris\u016bl) with a footprint on each side is carved. They are always erected in connection with some temple, but are often placed at a considerable distance from the shrine. Their object is to enable passers-by to make their obeisance and present their offerings, usually flowers, to the deity without having to go all the way to the actual shrine.\n\nThe trident, perhaps originally a representation of lightning, is the attribute not only of Shiva but also of Devi. It is with this weapon that she is regularly shown slaying the Buffalo-demon. Hence iron tridents of all sizes are favourite votive offerings presented to the goddess, and will be found in great number in any Devi shrine. They are likewise offered to the N\u0101gas, which moreover receive twisted sticks (evidently on account of their resemblance to snakes) and miniature wooden yokes. The latter, it is said, are presented when a young bullock is for the first time yoked to the plough; for the N\u0101ga is considered as the patron of cattle.\n\nThere can be little doubt that in the territory now forming Chamb\u0101 State two scripts once were in common use; the indigenous Br\u0101hm\u012b from which all modern alphabets of India are derived, and the Kharoshth\u012b written from right to left, which was introduced by the Achaemenids into the north-west of India, which formed part of their empire. At Pathy\u0101r and Kanhi\u0101ra, in the Kangra District, two rock-inscriptions are found, each of which contains the same legend in these two scripts. The Pathy\u0101r inscription belongs to the Maurya period, that of Kanhi\u0101ra to that of the Kushans, so that we must assume that for many centuries Br\u0101hm\u012b and Kharoshth\u012b were used side by side in this part of the Panj\u0101b. It is interesting to note that both the places where these inscriptions are found once were included in Chamb\u0101 territory.\n\nWithin the present limits of Chamb\u0101 State the earliest epigraphs hitherto recovered are a few short rock-inscriptions, in Gurmukhi character of the 6th century, which have not yet been satisfactorily deciphered. One of them reads:\u2014Om namah \u015aiv\u0101ya \u201cAdoration to Shiva.\u201d They were found in the Panali N\u0101la, near Gun, in the Lillh purgana.\n\nThe group of inscriptions of the reign of Meru-varman (c. A.D. 700), which were first brought to notice by General Cunningham, are of great interest for the early history of the State. They are engraved on the pedestals of the brass images of Lakshmi, Shakti, Ganesh and Nandi. The two Devi images are en-\n\n---\n\n1 Cf. Annual Report, Archaeological Survey, 1902-03, pp. 289 ff.\n2 Cf. Epigraphia Indica, Vol. VII (1902-03), pp. 116 ff.\n3 Report, Archaeological Survey, Vol. XIV, pp. 169 ff.\nshrined in the wood-carved temples described above, the Ganesh image is placed in a small, insignificant shrine at Brahmaur and the bull Nandi stands in front of the linga temple of Manimahes at the same place.\n\nThe inscriptions, engraved on the base of these idols in a far from correct type of Sanskrit, bear no date, but judging from the character they must belong to the beginning of the 8th century of our era. Besides the name of Meru-varman himself, two of them mention the names of Div\u0101kara-varman, his father; of Bala-varman, his grandfather; of Aditya-varman, his great-grandfather; and of M\u0101shuna or Moshuna, the progenitor of his race. From the title Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101dhir\u0101ja (literally, king of kings) used in one of the inscriptions it may be inferred that Meru-varman was an independent chief of some importance.\n\nIt is clear that his capital was at Brahmaur and that his dominions included Chhatr\u0101rhi. Gun, a few miles lower down on the opposite (right) bank of the R\u0101vi, must also have belonged to his territory. This is evident from an inscription on stone, discovered here in the summer of 1905, which records the founding of a Shiva temple by a feudatory chief (S\u0101manta) of the name of Ashadh\u0101, who mentions Meru-varman as his overlord.\n\nFor more than two centuries after Meru-varman all inscriptions cease. From the middle of the 10th century there begins a series of epigraphical records continued almost uninterruptedly up to the present day. Those of the pre-Muhammadan period are all in the \u015a\u0101rad\u0101 character, which is a descendant of the Western Gupta type, and was used all through the Panjab Hills, and probably also in the Plains. It is still in vogue among the Pandits of Kashmir. In the Muhammadan period this script gradually degenerates to the modern Takari. From the 13th century Nagari is used for copper-plate inscription. It is curious that on the earlier plates of this period the Raj\u0101's seal is invariably written in this character.\n\nThe earliest \u015a\u0101rad\u0101 inscription existing is probably the beautifully executed eulogy (prashasti) of Sarh\u0101n, opposite S\u0101ho. It consists of twenty lines carved on the two sides of a stone slab preserved in a small Shiva temple near that village. It contains no date and affords no historical information, but is remarkable for its fine workmanship and excellent preservation. The twenty-two verses of very good Sanskrit poetry which it contains are mainly devoted to extolling the beauty of Somaprabha, the spouse of the chief, S\u0101tyaki, the son of Bhogata. She is described as \"born from the house of the lord of Kishkindhika\" which, in the R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a, is the name of the fabulous realm of\n\n---\n\n(1) The only inscription which perhaps belongs to this period is the rock-inscription of Prati-ra-gala, which contains the name of Mrityunjaya-varman, not found in the Sanskrit.\n\n(2) Cf. Buehler, Indian Palaeography (transl. Fleet) pp. 57 ff.\nChamba State.\n\nCopper-plates.\n\nSugriva, the monkey-king, but here denotes the Himgrir pargana. Her husband, in order to establish an unshaken friendship between her and the Mountain-daughter (i.e. Parvati), erected a temple to Shiva Chandrashekhar (the Moon-crowned). There is reason to assume that the temple founded by Satiyaki is not the plain village temple in which the stone is now lying, but rather the important Shiv\u0101laya of Saho, known by the name of Chandrashekhar, which has been noted above. This sanctuary appears to have been restored at a not very remote date, and it is possible that on this occasion the stone recording its foundation was removed to the opposite side of the river.\n\nAmong the inscriptions of Chamb\u00e9 State the title-deeds engraved on copper-plates (pattas) are most prominent, both on account of their number and historical value. Nearly all of them record grants of land bestowed on temples or Brahmans by the Chamb\u00e9 Raj\u00e1s. Cunningham was the first to draw attention to the existence of three such documents in Chamb\u00e9. The number of inscribed copper-plates, however, is infinitely larger than Cunningham supposed, as apparently almost every Chamb\u00e9 Raj\u00e1 has been in the habit of giving grants of land. Up to the end of the reign of Raj\u00e1 Prithvi Singh eighty plates have been recovered. The total number of copper-plates found in the State may amount to double that number. The existence of a series of documents of this kind, issued by a line of rulers of one State during a period of ten centuries, is certainly unique in the Panjab and perhaps in the whole of India. It is the more remarkable as in the surrounding hill districts only very few specimens have come to light, and these of a comparatively recent date. Kalhana, the author of the Rajatarangini, mentions the occurrence of copper-plate grants in Kashmir which he consulted in composing his Chronicle, but hitherto not a single specimen has come to light. Evidently here as elsewhere Muhammadan rule led to the total destruction of those valuable historical documents. Chamb\u00e9 is at present the only place in the Panjab where copper-plates of the pre-Muhammadan period exist.\n\nThe earliest plate which has yet been found contains the name of Sahilla-varman, the reputed founder of Chamb\u00e9, and was issued by his son Yugakara\u2014or Yagikara\u2014varman in favour of the Narsingh Temple at Brahmaur. Next in order is a grant by Sahilla's grandson Vidagdha-varman. In the three following plates we find the names of Sivalahana-varman and his two sons Sama-varman and Asata. In the first of these three rulers Professor Kielhorn has recognised the Chamb\u00e9 Raj\u00e1 Sahar, who, according to the Rajatarangini (VII, 218), was composed by Ananta-deva of Kashmir (A.D. 1023-65). We also find Asata mentioned in the same Chronicle.\n\n---\n\n(1) \"By looking at the inscriptions recording the consecration of temples and grants by former kings, at the lacunary inscriptions, and at written works, the trouble arising from many errors has been overcome.\" Rajat. I, 15 (transl Rein).\nCHAP. I, B. (VII, 588) as having visited Kashmir in A.D. 1087-88 in the reign of Ananta's son and successor Kalasha. These data help us to fix the period to which those three plates belong as the second half of the 11th century. The two earlier plates may thus be assigned to the latter half of the 10th century. It should be noted that the five grants of the pre-Muhammadan period are only dated in the regnal year of their donors, so that their date can only be inferred from external evidence.\n\nThese inscriptions show that in the 10th or 11th centuries Chamb\u00e1 was an independent State, comprising the Upper R\u00e1v\u00ed and Budhil Valleys and the country round Chamb\u00e1 Town on both sides of the R\u00e1v\u00ed. As the plates are all dated from Chamb\u00e1 as the seat of government, it is probable that the State extended considerably further down, and comprised the whole of the R\u00e1v\u00ed Valley as far as the Siv\u00e1liks. It probably bordered on this side with the petty Hill-State of Balaur, the existence of which in the 11th century is attested by the R\u00e1jatarangini. Here it is frequently mentioned under the name of Vall\u00e1pura, from which the modern Balaur is derived.\n\nIt appears further from the early copper-plates that at that period Chamb\u00e1 was divided into districts (mandala), which partially seem to have corresponded to the modern parganas. The following are mentioned by name:\n\n1. Brahmapura, the present Brahmaur, occupying the Budhil Valley.\n\n2. Trighatta, now Treht\u00e1, a tract along the Upper R\u00e1v\u00ed above its junction with the Budhil. The name points to the existence of three passes (Sanskrit ghatta, Hindi gh\u00e1t), presumably those leading into Kangra across the Daula Dh\u00e1r.\n\n3. Panthila, the modern Panjila pargana, situated above Chamb\u00e1 between the right bank of the R\u00e1v\u00ed and the left bank of the S\u00e1ho.\n\n4. T\u00e1vasa (a name which is probably preserved in that of the village Tausa), stretching from the right bank of the S\u00e1ho as far as the right bank of the R\u00e1v\u00ed, a few miles below Chamb\u00e1 Town.\n\n5. P\u00e1ramata, on the left of the R\u00e1v\u00ed opposite the town of Chamb\u00e1, perhaps corresponding to the S\u00e1ch pargana.\n\n6. Bhatt\u00e1ra, probably corresponding to the Hol valley. The name is now applied to some fifteen villages in the Hol-Gudial pargana, one of which is called Banja. The local deity is known as Bhatt\u00e1r Devi Sital\u00e1, and the annual pilgrimage to her shrine is called the Bhatt\u00e1r j\u00e1tra.\n\nAnother important class of epigraphical records are the fountain inscriptions, which are nearly contemporaneous with the early copper-plates. They are commonly found on huge slabs, covered\nwith quaint figures and ornamental carvings, which were erected at springs, and dedicated to Varuna, the god of the waters. His figure usually occupies the centre of the carved surface. A water-spout, sometimes likewise carved, is passed through a square hole in the lower portion of the stone, and in a few instances a cistern consisting of three slabs is constructed in front to receive the water. These stones are peculiar to Chamb\u00e1. The only place outside Chamb\u00e1 where I have noticed them is Sisu in British-Lahul.(1) In Chamb\u00e1 they are especially numerous in Churih and P\u00e1ngi. A few specimens exist at Trilokmath in Chamba-Lahul, but these are not inscribed. In the R\u00e1vi Valley proper fountain-slabs exist, e.g., at Brahmaur and Chhatr\u00e1rhi, but of a much smaller type and without inscriptions. These commonly are carved with figures of the Nava-grahas, of Vishnu resting on Shesha, of the ten incarnations (avat\u00e1ras) of the same deity, and of the river-goddesses Gang\u00e1 and Yamun\u00e1. In the summer of 1906 a stone of this type was discovered built in the wall of a house in the city. A well-preserved specimen is placed under a banyan tree in the village of Kheri (map Kairi) on the left bank of the R\u00e1vi, close to the British border.\n\nThe inscribed fountain-slabs of Churih and P\u00e1ngi are of peculiar interest for Chamb\u00e1 chronology, as they are fully dated both in the Sh\u00e1stra or Saptarshi era (also called Lokak\u00edla),(2) and according to the reign of the ruling chief. The name of the month, the lunar day (tithi), the week day and the lunar mansion (nakshatra) are also indicated, so that it is possible to verify the dates. The fountain-stone of Luj near the P\u00e1dar border, dated in the first year of R\u00e1j\u00e1 J\u00e1sata, supplies the first fixed date in Chamb\u00e1 history, viz., A.D. 1105. It also shows that at this period P\u00e1ngi formed part of the R\u00e1j\u00e1's dominions. That of S\u00e1lhi in the Sechu-Nil\u00e1, dated in the 27th year of Lalita-varman and in the Sh\u00e1stra year 48 (A.D. 1170), establishes the year of accession of that R\u00e1j\u00e1 to be A.D. 1144. It was erected by a local R\u00e1na, Ludrap\u00fala by name, whose descendants still live on the spot.\n\nThe S\u00e1lhi stone, the largest of its kind (6 feet 6 inches high, 7 feet wide), is moreover of peculiar interest on account of its carvings. These represent various deities arranged in three rows, each figure being marked with an inscription. The centre of the upper row is occupied by Shiva with his trident; to his right are Varuna, the god of the waters, and Ganesha; to his left Indra, the thunder god, and the six-faced K\u00e1rttikeya. Each figure is accompanied by its peculiar vehicle (v\u00e1hana). In the middle of the slab over the spout-opening is a panel representing Vishnu's sleep. The remaining eight figures are river-goddesses, all identical in attitude and attributes, and distinguished only by their v\u00e1hanas. They are shown standing, and hold a lotus-stem and\n\n---\n\n(1) Cf. Moorcroft Travels, London 1841, Vol. I, p. 194.\n(2) On this era, vide Keilhorn Indian Antiquary, Vol. XX (1891), pp. 140 ff.\na water-vessel on which the name of the river which they personify is incised. Thus we are enabled to recognize Gangu (Ganges), Yamuna (Jamin\u00e1), Sindhu (Indus), Veth (Jehlam), By\u00e1s (Bi\u00e1s) and Satindr (Satluj). The two remaining figures which are partly destroyed must have represented the two rivers of Chamb\u00e1, the R\u00e1v\u00ed and the Chandrabh\u00e1g\u00e1. Thus we have the sacred twin-rivers of India, the Indus, and the five rivers of the Panjab. It is worthy of note that the names in the inscriptions are given in the vernacular spoken in the Hills.\n\nAmong the fountain-stones of Chur\u00e1h that of Sai deserves special notice. Here also the figures have inscriptions containing their respective names. They are arranged in two rows, but only those of the upper row represent deities. The lower compartment is reserved for mortals. Here we find an effigy of the person for whose sake the stone was erected, named R\u00e1nautra Ph\u00e1hi, in the inscription. The female figure which accompanies him, the inscription of which is lost, probably represents his wife. Both are shown in the act of worshipping a linga. The two remaining figures I suppose to be female attendants. The main inscription, besides recording the erection of the fountain-stone, contains a stanza in corrupt Sanskrit, in which the comparative merit of various pious works is stated. Most meritorious of all, according to the poet, is the consecration of a road. The inscription is dated in the year 4270 of the Kali-yuga, or era of Sin, corresponding with A.D. 1168-69. It adds that 427,730 years still remain; the whole period consisting of 482,000 years. The Sai inscription is the only pre-Muhammadan record, found in Chamb\u00e1, dated in an era other than the Lokak\u00e1la or Sh\u00e1stra era. It is moreover of special interest to find here the Kali-yuga reckoning, which is hardly ever used in inscriptions.\n\nAt Naghai, a hamlet two miles south of Sai, half a dozen carved fountain-slabs were unearthed about 1895. One of them bears an indistinct inscription in which it is stated that in the reign of Trilokya-deva the Varuna-deva (i.e., the slab in question) was erected by Deva-pras\u00e1da, the son of R\u00e1j\u00e1na N\u00e1ga-pras\u00e1da, the son of N\u00e1guka, for the sake of the bliss in the next world of R\u00e1n\u00ed Mekhal\u00e1. We recognise the god Varuna in the central figure carved on the slab. To his left stands a female with two miniature figures, which we may assume to represent the deceased R\u00e1n\u00ed and her two children. The central portion of the stone is decorated with an exquisitely-carved band of foliated ornament. The name of Trilokya-deva is mentioned on two other inscribed fountain-stones in the villages of Bhak\u00fand and Dady\u00e1r. As the name does not occur on the genealogical roll of the Chamb\u00e1 R\u00e1j\u00e1s, and the three inscriptions are found at no great distance from each other,\n\n(1) Cf. Sewell-Dikshit, The Indian Calendar, London 1896, pp. 40 f.\n(2) The Bhakund stone has been removed to Chamb\u00e1 to be placed in the proposed State Museum.\nit is probable that Trailokya-deva was a local ruler who owned allegiance to the R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Chamb\u00e1. His date seems to have been the first half of the 11th century.\n\nTwo fountain-inscriptions, of a different type from those already noted, remain still to be discussed. Whereas the latter are brief records in a mixture of Sanskrit and vernacular, the two inscriptions of D\u00e9vi-Koth\u00ed and M\u00fal-Kih\u00e1r are extensive eulogies or prashastis in elegant Sanskrit poetry. Unfortunately neither of the two is complete. The D\u00e9vi-Koth\u00ed inscription was originally incised on two slabs of equal size let into the back-wall of the cistern, the construction of which it records. In the centre an inscribed image of N\u00e1r\u00e1yana was placed. One of the two slabs containing the first half of the poem has disappeared. Locally it is asserted that it was carried off by a lama, but it is not at all impossible that some day it will be discovered in one of the walls of the village. Two other inscribed stones, it may be noted in passing, have been recovered in this manner. The remaining half of the inscription contains a eulogy of the local R\u00e1na N\u00e1ga-p\u00e1la, whose genealogy presumably was given in the lost portion. It relates how, after his father's death, he withheld his mother from becoming a sati, and how she had a cistern built in memory of her deceased husband. The inscription is dated in the 17th year of Lalita-varman, who is stated to have conferred on N\u00e1gap\u00e1la the title of R\u00e1j\u00e1naka, i.e. R\u00e1na. It bore also a Sh\u00e1stra date which unfortunately is lost, but as the Devi-Koth\u00ed inscription is ten years anterior to the S\u00e1hi of the 27th year of Lalita-varman, its date must be A.D. 1160. The author of the eulogy was Kama-tak\u00f1chhana the R\u00e1jaguru, whose learning and poetical skill is amply attested by the document.\n\nThe M\u00fal-Kih\u00e1r fountain-inscription is in a deplorable state of mutilation, the right end of the stone being broken off and the remaining portion greatly defaced. This is the more to be regretted as it was evidently a work both of literary merit and historical interest. In some thirty stanzas of excellent Sanskrit poetry it gives the genealogy of the local R\u00e1ni, and relates the circumstances under which the cistern was constructed. Unfortunately many of the names are lost. The first name seems to be Gayap\u00e1la who, perhaps, is identical with a Th\u00e1kur of that name mentioned in Kalhana's Rajatarangini, as minister-in-chief of the forces which were to restore Bhiksh\u00e1chara, the grandson of Tarsha, to the throne of Kashmir. We read in the inscription that he belonged to the house (gotra) of K\u00e1shyaps. It was apparently Gayap\u00e1la's grandson who founded the cistern, in memory of his wife. The inscription is dated in the regnal year of some Chamb\u00e1 R\u00e1ja, perhaps Vijaya-varman, and from the character it may be assigned to the beginning of the 13th century.\n\n(1) The word R\u00e1j\u00e1naka is lost, but can be restored with next to full certainty.\nThere are a few fountain-stones which were erected by Brahmins, e.g., that of Dadv\u00e1r, and probably also that of Bhak\u00fand, which was set up by Parip\u00farna, the son of Bhosharman, \"fearing with the fear of existence\" (sams\u00e1ra-bhaya-bh\u00edtena). But the great bulk of these inscriptions are due to feudatory chiefs or R\u00e1n\u00e1s. The existence of such R\u00e1n\u00e1s in the K\u00e1ngr\u00e1 Valley is attested by the Baijn\u00e1th prashastis. In the 12th century they must have been still numerous and powerful in Chur\u00e1lh and P\u00e1ngi, as appears from the inscriptions discussed. They evidently owed allegiance to the R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Chamb\u00e1 and dated their inscriptions in the regnal year of their reign. It is remarkable that in the inscriptions of the Muhammadan period no mention whatever is made of these R\u00e1n\u00e1s. They must have gradually disappeared, in what manner it is impossible exactly to decide. We may, however, presume that it was the policy of the R\u00e1j\u00e1 to curtail the power of these barons of the Hills, whose existence constituted a constant danger to his own position. He may have attained this end partly by main force, and partly by the policy of attaching them to his court and person. This we may infer from the fact that the copper-plate of Soma-varman contains the names of two R\u00e1n\u00e1s who held the offices of Prime Minister and Lord Chancellor. At the present day there are only a few R\u00e1n\u00e1s in Chamb\u00e1 State who still hold the position of feudatory chiefs, the principal one being the R\u00e1n\u00e1 of Trilokn\u00e1th in L\u00e1bul. The descendants of those R\u00e1n\u00e1s who were deprived of their baronies have taken to agriculture, but are still distinguished by the title of their ancestors, which now in reality has become their caste-name.\n\nThe inscriptions of the Muhammadan period do not exhibit the great variety of the earlier epigraphs. They are almost exclusively copper-plate grants. Earliest in date is one of Veir\u00e1si-varman of A.D. 1330. Next come four plates of Bhota-varman c.A.D. 1400. From that time onwards the plates are found uninterruptedly up to the reign of the present R\u00e1j\u00e1. The difference between the pre-Muhammadan plates and those of the 14th and 15th centuries is most striking. Whereas the former are neatly engraved in well-defined Sh\u00e1rad\u00e1 characters and written in very tolerable Sanskrit, we find the latter scribbled on small-sized and irregular-shaped plates in a far from distinct type of T\u00e1kar\u00ed, and in a language which, though evidently meant for Sanskrit, shows an astonishing ignorance of its most elementary grammatical rules. This marked degeneration, both of scholarship and workmanship, may no doubt be accounted for by the general deterioration of Hind\u00faism after the final victory of Isl\u00e1m in India, and particularly by the establishment of Muhammadan rule in Kashmir, which always had been a great centre of Sanskrit learning.\n\nTowards the end of the 16th century, in the reign of Prat\u00e1p Singh (a contemporary of Akbar), there is a decided improvement in the execution of the plates, which perhaps was an outcome o\nthe general revival of Hindu art, under the tolerant rule of the early Mughal emperors. We also notice a tendency to follow the old examples of the pre-Muhammadan period, but the knowledge of Sanskrit remains at a low ebb, and in those passages where the boundaries of the granted lands are described it is considered safer to resort to the vernacular. From a linguistic point of view these bh\u0101\u1e63\u0101 portions are of great interest, as they contain numerous geographical and agricultural terms now partly obsolete or changed in form and meaning. The forty-two copper-plate grants of R\u0101j\u0101 Balabhadra (A.D. 1589-1640-1) deserve special notice on account of their fair execution. As regards language, also, they are decidedly superior to any plates of this period.\n\nIn one respect the plates of the Muhammadan period may be said to show progress; in so far as nearly all of them are dated, some in the \u015ai\u015b\u1e6dra or Lokak\u0101la era alone, but most of them both in the \u015ai\u015b\u1e6dra and Vikrama eras. In the 17th and 18th centuries we find occasionally, in addition to these two, the Shaka era also used. This circumstance considerably increases their historical value, and enables us to fix approximately the reign of each of the Chamb\u0101 Raj\u0101s.\n\nAnother noteworthy point is this that the pre-Muhammadan plates have a distinct Shaiva character. It is true that two of them mention the erection of a temple to Vishnu, but in the general formulae of the grants the first place is given to \u015aiva. R\u0101ma is only quoted as an example of filial piety; Krishna is never spoken of. The prevalence of Shaivism is also borne out by the stone inscriptions, three of which record the founding of a \u015aiva temple. On the fountain-stones we usually find figures worshipping a linga. In the later copper-plates, on the contrary, R\u0101ma has become the designation of the supreme deity, and the grant is given \"for the sake of the pleasure of Krishna.\"\n\nFinally, I may mention a Sanskrit inscription cut in ten lines of Takari letters on a platform at the outskirts of Chamb\u0101 Town, on the old road to Sarol. It is dated Vikrama sameat 1717, Shaka 182, \u015ai\u015b\u1e6dra 35, Vaish\u0101kha b\u0101di 13, Wednesday, on the conjunction of the Sun and Aries (i.e., at the time of the Vernal Equinox). The date corresponds to Wednesday, the 28th March, A.D. 1660. Careful notation of the date would lead us to expect the record of an important historical event, but the inscription only mentions that on that date a pipal tree (Sanskrit ashvattha) was planted on a platform built by Sundara-d\u0101sa, the son of Vira of Bh\u0101giratha-d\u0101sa, \"for the sake of the pious i-V\u0101r\u0101vana.\" It winds up with the wish \"that all...\"\nThe principal authority for the history of the State is the ban-\nsauli or genealogical roll of the R\u00e1j\u00e1s, which, in addition to a full\nlist of names, contains much historical detail of great interest and\nvalue. Next in importance are the epigraphical records already\ndescribed. Thirdly, popular tradition is often very helpful in\nthrowing light on the history of the past, and much information of\na fairly reliable character has come down to us through this channel.\nIn addition to these sources, the references to Chamb\u00e1 in the annals\nof other States have proved of much value in fixing the chronologi-\ncal order of events. This is specially true of the R\u00e1jatarangini, or\nHistory of Kashmir, in which are to be found several references to\nChamb\u00e1 of great importance.\n\nThere are no sources of information to help us to determine\nwho were the original inhabitants of the mountain area now in-\ncluded in Chamb\u00e1 State, but common tradition affirms that they\ncame from the plains. If one may hazard a conjecture where all\nis uncertain it seems not improbable that the aborigines of these\nhills are now represented to a large extent by the various low-caste\ntribes, which form a very considerable proportion of the population.\nWe know that this is the case on the plains, and it seems not\nunreasonable to believe that the same is true of the hills. In\nChamb\u00e1 State the tribes in question comprise fully one-fourth of\nthe population. They are included under the names of Kol\u00ed, H\u00e1li,\nS\u00edpi, Cham\u00e1r, D\u00e1mn\u00e1, Barw\u00e1l\u00e1, Megh, Darain, Reh\u00e1ra, Sar\u00e1ra, Lob\u00e1r,\nBhatw\u00e1l, Dhaugr\u00ed, and some others. Though differing among\nthemselves as regards social status, they are all looked upon as outcast\nby the high-caste Hind\u00fa, who applies to them the epithet of Chan\u00e1l\nor Chand\u00e1l. These low-caste tribes possess no traditions as to their\noriginal home, which tends to confirm the conjecture that a long\nperiod of time must have elapsed since they first migrated to the\nhills. General Cunningham believed that the Western Himalaya\nwere at one time occupied by a true Kolian group from the same\nrace as the Kols of Central India. There are still many people in\nthe Western Hills who bear the name of Kol\u00ed; and the H\u00e1li, S\u00edpi,\nMegh, and D\u00e1g\u00ed, &c., are essentially the same people. The D\u00e1\nof Kul\u00fa, for example, are all called Kol\u00ed as an alternative name.\nThese tribes must have been of non-Aryan origin like the other\naborigines of India, but a great fusion of races took place in ancient\ntimes by intermarriage, and later by degradation from the higher\ncastes a process which is still going on. This doubtless led in\nsome measure to many changes in the appearance and characterist-\nics of the people, and to these we may ascribe the fact that all now\nspeak one language, the Aryan tongues, and use dialects of the Arya-\nof languages. These low-caste tribes are employed in menial occupations, many of them being farm-servants and artisans. Some of those in Chamb\u00e1 State, and probably in other parts of the hills, are small farmers, and hold land either directly from the State, or from high-caste proprietors. In their subordinate position of farm-servants they were usually spoken of as k\u00e1ma, and in former times, and indeed up to the commencement of British rule, were in a state analogous to that of slavery. Even now they labour under some social restrictions, especially in the Native States; and their condition generally seems to indicate that they have long occupied a very depressed position in the social scale. There is a common saying in the hills which runs thus:\n\nChand\u00e1l jeth\u00e1: R\u00e1th\u00ed kaneth\u00e1.\n\n\"The Chand\u00e1l is the elder brother: the R\u00e1th\u00ed the younger.\" The meaning attached to this saying by the people is, that the high-castes are dependent on the Chand\u00e1ls, just as a younger brother is on an elder one. No ceremony of any importance can take place without their presence and help. At births, marriages and deaths they are indispensable in one capacity or another. It seems improbable, however, that this was the original signification, which has become obscured through the lapse of ages. It is more likely that the saying is an unconscious expression of the general conviction that the Chand\u00e1ls were the original inhabitants of the hills. The R\u00e1th\u00eds came at a later period; yet so long a time has elapsed since even they migrated to the mountains, that it is certain, that it continued.\n\nA new view of Aryan migration, some parts of the mountain-settlement Report, Sir J. B. hills. He postulates three lines relating to that period are along the foot of the Him\u00e1l\u2014more past in the case of Kangra Aryans, being hillmen, tended refer to a time which is compared there is clear evidence, in st\u00e9vi and Chandrabh\u00e1g\u00e1 Valleys. It the Western Him\u00e1laya Valley was conquered from the R\u00e1mas, in which the hymns were, by the founder of the Chamb\u00e1 State, therefore assume tenth century A.D.; but the lower portion of Chamb\u00e1 State are considered till the early part of the tenth century.\n\nAt the present having been taken from the Th\u00e1kurs who Br\u00e1hman, R\u00e1jp\u00fat, The Th\u00e1kurs of the Chandrabh\u00e1g\u00e1 Valley, be regarded as out rulers, are referred to in the Rajatarangini high-caste population part of the twelfth century.

A still more striking\n\n(1) Buddhist India, p. 45.\n(2) Vedic India, p. 47.\n(3) Raj\u00e1 ruled the country until subdued by Raj\u00e1\n\nMany inscriptions dating from the time of the R\u00e1mas have recently been found in Chamb\u00e1. One of the earliest of these, containing the word Raj\u00e1\u00f1al\u00e1\u2014R\u00e1ma, dates from about A.D. 700.\n\n(4) The original form of the word was Th\u00e1kura, of which Th\u00e1kur is a later variation.\nBut while the lower strata of the population in each of these castes are probably of ancient origin, it is certain that all of them have received large accessions from the plains at various periods, as the result of invasion and immigration.\n\nAs regards the Br\u0101hmans, it is probable that many of them began to find their way into the hills at an early period, as priests and religious devotees. The Gaddi Br\u0101hmans have a tradition that their ancestors came from Delhi to Br\u0101hmaur in the reign of R\u0101ja Ajia Varma, A.D. 780-800. Many of the R\u0101jputs are probably the descendants of invaders from the plains. The Gaddi R\u0101jputs have the same tradition as the Gaddi Br\u0101hmans as to their original home; while the Gaddi Khatri say that their ancestors fled from Lahore to escape persecution, probably at the time of the early Muhammadan invasions. Doubtless many of all castes came to the hills for the same reason during the period of Muhammadan rule.\n\nThe Th\u0101kur and R\u0101th\u012b are almost certainly of ancient origin, and are regarded as indigenous to the hills. These castes are widely distributed throughout the Western Hills. In the Jammu area, between the Jhelum and the R\u0101v\u012b, they are all classed as Th\u0101kur; and in the Kangra area, the same people are called Th\u0101kur and R\u0101th\u012b. They are essentially an agricultural people, resembling in many respects the Jats of the plains. In Chamba they number more than one-half of the high-caste inhabitants, and form the backbone of the population.\n\nThe Gaddis are a separate clan. The term Gaddi is a generic name, and under it are included Br\u0101hmans, R\u0101jputs, Khatri, Th\u0101kurs and R\u0101th\u012bs. The majority, however, are Khatri. As the custom of the Br\u0101hman and R\u0101jput sections is to return themselves under their caste names, it is improbable that any of these have been classed as Gaddis. The Census Return may therefore be regarded as including, chiefly, the Khatri, Th\u0101kur, and R\u0101th\u012b sections of the clan. The traditions as to their original home have already been referred to. They are found principally in the Br\u0101hmaur Wizrat, which is called Gaddi\u0101n, but also in other parts of the State.\n\nAs regards the minor high-castes, chiefly consisting of Khatri, Kumh\u0101r, Jat, Sikh, &c., the figures for each are so small that their presence in the State is easily accounted for, and the same is true of the Muhammadan portion of the population. They must all have come from the plains probably at no very remote period.\n\nNow the most ancient traditions current in the hills have reference to a time when the greater part of the Western Himalaya was under the rule of petty chiefs, who bore the reign of Prat\u0101p or Rand. These chiefs owned States of decided improvement, perhaps was an outcome o\nand, in what is now Chamba territory, each of these was called ranhu. They are said to have been constantly at war with one another, and their ranhu boundaries were in consequence very unsettled. As regards caste the general opinion is that the Ranas were Rajputs, and all the existing families are of this caste. In the case of the Thakurs common opinion is not so clear, but the general impression seems to be that they belonged to the caste which is indicated by the name. Probably most of them originally were of Rath\u00ed caste. We may suppose that, having gained an ascendancy over a small portion of territory, each of these Rath\u00ed leaders was recognized as ruler, and assumed, or was given the title of 'Thakur,' meaning 'chief' or 'lord.' The various offshoots of the ruling families of Rath\u00ed caste would naturally seek a distinctive name for themselves, and thus the word Thakur probably acquired the secondary meaning which it still bears, as the name of a separate caste. This caste ranks immediately beneath the Rajput, and above the Rath\u00ed, the chief distinction being that the Rajput will take the daughter of a Thakur in marriage, but will not give his own in return, and the same is true of the Thakur and Rath\u00ed. As a caste name the word is pronounced Thakkur.\n\nThe period during which the Thakurs and Ranas ruled in the hills is often of as the 'Thakuri' or 'Thakurain.' This Thakurain period have been of very ancient origin, but when it began, how long it lasted, are questions to which satisfactory answers can be given. One thing is certain, that it continued in force for a much longer time in some parts of the mountains than in others. In the Kul\u00e1 Settlement Report, Sir J. B. Lyall points out that the traditions relating to that period are carried back to a much more remote past in the case of Kangra than in that of Kul\u00e1, and they refer to a time which is comparatively recent as regards the Ravi and Chandrabh\u00e1ga Valleys. It is true that the Upper Ravi Valley was conquered from the Ranas, who previously ruled there, by the founder of the Chamba State, in the middle of the sixth century A.D.; but the lower portion of the valley was not subdued till the early part of the tenth century. The Kashtw\u00e1r State was founded towards the end of the tenth century, the country having been taken from the Thakurs who previously held it. The Thakurs of the Chandrabh\u00e1ga Valley, evidently independent rulers, are referred to in the Rajatarangini as late as the early part of the twelfth century. The Bhadraw\u00e1h State again seems, from the bansuli, to have been founded about the time of Akbar the Great, and there, too, the Ranas are said to have been in power previous to this. A still more striking instance is that of P\u00e1dar in the Chandrabh\u00e1ga Valley. There the Ranas unquestionably ruled the country until subdued by Raj\u00e1.\n\n(1) Many inscriptions dating from the time of the Ranas have recently been found in Chamba. One of the earliest of these, containing the word Raj\u00e1nakarana, dates from about A.D. 700.\n(2) The original form of the word was Thakkuro, of which Thakur is a later variation.\nChatar Singh of Chamb\u00e1, at a date subsequent to A.D. 1664. The descendants of several of them are still in existence, and are now reduced to the position of common zamind\u00e1rs, but the traditions regarding them are so clear and definite that there can be no doubt as to their authenticity. In P\u00e1ng\u00ed the traditions of a Thakurain period refer to a time more remote than in the case of P\u00e1dar, due to the fact that it was subjected to Chamb\u00e1 at an earlier date. There also, however, several of the old families still exist as common farmers.(1) In L\u00e1hul the Th\u00e1kurs are in possession to the present day of most of the territory ruled by their ancestors. Indeed, all through the hills traces are still to be found of the old order of things, and local tradition can often point to the sites of the R\u00e1n\u00e1s' forts,(2) or recall stories of their exploits, and even define the boundaries of their territories. In the Chamb\u00e1 State there are several cases in which their descendants retain possession to this day of the whole, or a part of the old family domain, and still bear the old family title; while many more who have sunk to the position of common cultivators are spoken of, and addressed as R\u00e1n\u00e1. In the Kul\u00fa Settlement Report, Sir J. B. Lyall says: \"Many of the existing koth\u00eds and tapp\u00e1s are said to have possessed their present limits from the day when each of them formed the domain of a Th\u00e1kur.\" The same is probably true as regards some of the parganas of Chamb\u00e1 State, though, judging from common tradition, the country would, agriculturally, have been more minutely subdivided than was the case in former times, however, these parganas were more numerous than at present, and may then have represented, to a greater extent than they do now, the ancient limits of the old ranhus. Some of the State koth\u00eds are said to stand on the very sites formerly occupied by the R\u00e1n\u00e1s' forts, and in several instances, the ancient buildings themselves are still in use.(3)\n\nAs regards their relation to the more powerful States in their vicinity, Sir J. B. Lyall suggests that the small States of the Thakurain period can seldom have been entirely independent. He says: \"Without a lord paramount, and with no bond of confederacy, such diminutive States could never have existed side by side for any length of time. It is pretty certain, therefore, that with short intervals of complete independence in periods of confusion, they must have been more or less subject and tributary to some superior power.\" This remark was made with reference to the States of\n\n(1) A R\u00e1n\u00e1 and a Th\u00e1kur are still resident in Kil\u00e1r, and on the first day of the annual mela in October, they are escorted in state from their homes to the place of meeting; the local State officials even sometimes supporting them on the right and left.\n\n(2) The remains of the R\u00e1n\u00e1s' fort are still to be seen on the Bannu Hill near Chamb\u00e1; and the following popular rhyme has handed down the name of one of them to our own day:\n\n\"Bahla R\u00e1n\u00e1, Bahla R\u00e1n\u00e1;\nBannu kot, Sarol p\u00e1\u0144;\nBadram janjan kh\u00e1n.\"\n\n\"Bahla R\u00e1n\u00e1 and Bahla R\u00e1n\u00e1 had their fort on Bannu Hill, their water from Sarol (a cool spring near Chamb\u00e1), and their rice from Badram (a place near Chamb\u00e1).\"\n\n(3) In the Simla Hill States, some of which are almost as diminutive as an ancient ranhu, most of the rulers still bear the old title of R\u00e1n\u00e1 or Th\u00e1kur, and collectively these States are called the Thakurain.\nthe Kul\u00fa area, but it is probably true of the whole of the Western Hills. General Cunningham was of opinion that in early times the greater part of the tract now comprised in the Chamb\u00e1 State, as far east as the R\u00e1v\u00ed and Dhaula Dh\u00e1r, was under the control of K\u00e1shm\u00edr. This would appear to have been the case in the seventh century, at the time of the visit of Huen Thsang, and it was so again in the ninth century, when, by the conquest of Trigarta, the sovereign power of K\u00e1shm\u00edr was extended to the Satlej. Chamb\u00e1 was again conquered by K\u00e1shm\u00edr about A.D. 1050-60; and seems to have remained more or less dependent on that kingdom until the early part of the twelfth century, when the confusion resulting from internal dissension, and the Muhammadan invasions, enabled it to assert its independence. We may, therefore, conclude that, from very early times, Kashmir claimed suzerain power over the greater part of the territory now embraced in Chamb\u00e1 State.\n\nThe Thakurain period was followed by the rise of numerous Rajput principalities which held sway throughout the Western Hills up to comparatively recent times, and some of which still remain.(1) These were all founded by Rajput leaders\u2014each probably with a small band of followers\u2014who either came directly from the Plains, or were scions of one or other of the ruling families who had previously established themselves in the Hills. By them the R\u00e1n\u00e1s(1) and Th\u00e1kurs were either expelled, or reduced to the position of tributaries or subjects.(1)\n\nDr. Vogel\u2019s researches in Chamb\u00e1 have brought to light the interesting fact that the R\u00e1n\u00e1s did not immediately sink into obscurity after their final subjection, but continued for a long period to hold influential positions in the State. They are mentioned in one of the early copper-plate title deeds under the name of \u2018R\u00e1j\u00e1naka,\u2019 and the place in order assigned them, immediately after the R\u00e1ja, seems to indicate that they were prominent and honourable members of the community. They seem also to have filled various offices in the State administration. There are also traditions pointing to the fact that they did not always yield a willing obedience to the new rulers, and that rebellion was not unknown among them. And such outbreaks did not occur only in Chamb\u00e1, for we learn from the annals of Bhadraw\u00e1h and Kashtw\u00e1r, that, in both of these States, the old rulers combined against their new masters, and made a determined effort to drive them out. In each case this happened a long period posterior to the founding of the State.\n\nAccording to General Cunningham, the oldest classification of the Rajput principalities of the Western Himalaya, between the Satlej and the Indus, divided them into three great groups, each\n\n(1) There are still twenty or thirty R\u00e1n\u00e1 families in Chamb\u00e1 State.\nof which was named after the State which held the position of head of the confederation. These were Kashmir, Durgara or Dugar, and Trigarta. There are indications that this division into three groups was in existence from a period anterior to the seventh century, and Chamb\u00e1 was in early times associated with the first, or Kashmir, group of States. A classification of much later date divided the alpine Panjab, between the Satlej and the Indus, into 22 Hindu and 22 Muhammadan Chiefships\u2014(1)\u2014the former being to the east and the latter to the west of the Chen\u00e1b.(2)\n\nAgain the 22 Hindu States between the Satlej and the Chen\u00e1b were arranged in two groups or circles, named the Jalandhar or Kangra Circle, and the Dugar or Jammu Circle, one being to the east, and the other to the west of the R\u00e1v\u00ed. Each of these circles was popularly regarded as containing eleven States, Kangra and Jammu being recognized as the respective heads. Chamb\u00e1 was chiefly associated with the Kangra Circle, but, owing to the fact that the R\u00e1v\u00ed divides the State into two parts, it was included in both groups.(3)\n\nThe royal clan in each of these States had a special designation based on the custom which obtained in almost all the Rajput States in the hills, in accordance with which the ruling line took its distinctive name from that of the country over which it ruled. The clan name of the Chamb\u00e1 royal family is Chambi\u00e1l or Chami\u00e1l.\n\nThe original title, or suffix in the Chamb\u00e1 royal family, was 'Varma', a cognomen extensively used in ancient times. It was used in the reigning families of Nep\u00e1l, Kamar\u00fap or Ass\u00e1m, and Kanauj in the seventh and eighth centuries; in the R\u00e1thor family before it acquired Kanauj, and by the Chandel Rajas of Bundelkhand. Though probably not adopted as a dynastic surname in any of these families, its use by individual chiefs proves that it was widely known. There was also an entire Varma dynasty in Kashmir, from A.D. 854 to 936; and the cognomen is still in use in the royal houses of Travancore and Cochin. The Chamb\u00e1 Raj\u00e1s continued to bear it till the end of the sixteenth century, after which it was gradually displaced by \"Singh,\" which was then coming into general use among Rajputs, but the older title is still employed in all religious ceremonies.\n\nThe title 'Deva' is also found after each R\u00e1ja's name in the inscriptions and copper-plates. This too was a royal designation, as we learn from Sanskrit literature, and was affixed to the names of all kings and queens in its masculine or feminine form, just as Rex and Regina are in our own Royal Family. Hence arose the Rajput salutation Jaideva = Jaideva, which originally was accorded only to Rajputs of royal rank. The original form in Sanskrit was Jayatu Dev\u00e1h, \"May the King be victorious.\"\n\nIn former times, as we learn from the copper-plates, an heir-apparent in Chamb\u00e1 bore the title of 'Yuvar\u00e1ja.' When it was discarded is not known, but it is found in plates issued towards the end of the sixteenth century. At the present time an heir-apparent, if a son of the ruling chief, has the distinctive title of 'Tika,' while younger sons are named Duthain,\n\n---\n\n(1) Excepting Chamb\u00e1, Mandi and Suket, they were all overthrown during Sikh rule\u2014between A.D. 1811 and 1841. All the States of the Dugar Circle, except Chamb\u00e1, and all the Muhammadan States between the Chen\u00e1b and the Jhelum are now merged in Jammu.\n\n(2) Anc. Geo. of India, page 130.\n\n(3) Vide Kangra Settlement Report, page 8.\nTirbain, Chauthain, &c. These titles are modern, and date only from the sixteenth century. The title 'Tika' occurs on a plate dated A.D. 1579.\n\nThe title 'Mi\u00e1n' was originally borne only by the scions of the royal houses of the Kangra and Dugar Circles, and is said to have been given them by one of the Mughal Emperors, probably Jahangir, but its precise origin and signification are unknown. It occurs as \"Mic\" on a copper-plate, dated A.D. 1613, as one of the titles of Janardan, son and heir-apparent of Raja Bula Bhadra. Younger sons of a ruling chief, other than the Tika, and also brothers, are addressed as 'Mi\u00e1n Sahib.'\n\nIt is difficult to determine with certainty the exact date at which the Chamb\u00e1 State was founded, but it seems probable that this event took place about the middle of the sixth century, A.D. The following are the reasons on which this conclusion is based. There are, as has already been said, several references to Chamb\u00e1\u2014or Champ\u00e1 as the place was then named\u2014in the Rajatarangini, and the earliest of these is interesting and valuable as furnishing a fixed and fairly reliable date from which to begin our chronological inquiry. We read that Ananta Deva, Raja of Kashmir, who reigned from A.D. 1028 to 1068, invaded Champ\u00e1; uprooted the ruling Raja named S\u00e1la, and set up another in his place. No reference to this invasion is to be found in the State annals, and there is only one Raja mentioned in the bansauli, whose name bears any resemblance to that in the Rajatarangini. This is the name of S\u00e1la or S\u00e1hila Varma, who was the founder of the present capital. It was for some time supposed that this was the Raja referred to, and the absence of any allusion to the invasion in the Chronicle left the matter more or less in doubt, until the discovery of three copper-plate title deeds, which practically set the question at rest. All of these title deeds make mention of a Raja named S\u00e1lavihana Varma, whose name is entirely omitted from the bansauli, as also that of his elder son Soma Varma. Asuta Varma, his younger son, is alone mentioned. It is manifest that S\u00e1lavihana must be the Raja referred to as having been deposed by Ananta Deva. That both he and his son Soma Varma actually reigned is clear from the tenor of the inscriptions on the copper-plates. Unfortunately they have no date. We know, however, that Ananta Deva began his reign as a child in A.D. 1028, and may therefore assume that his conquest of Chamb\u00e1 cannot have taken place before 1050. As he abdicated in favour of his son in 1063, the invasion must have occurred previous to this; and such is implied in the narrative. The earliest of the copper-plates in question purports to have been granted by Soma Varma, son of S\u00e1lavihana Varma, in the seventh year of his reign, in the month of Bhadon, and on the occasion of a solar eclipse. There was a solar eclipse in Bhadon (1) 1066, and though the day does not exactly correspond with that on the plate, it is near enough to raise a strong probability that this is the eclipse referred to.\n\n(1) Solar eclipses took place in the month of Bhadon of the years 1047, 1050 and 1066, but we are justified in restricting the alternative dates to 1056 and 1066, the latter being regarded as the more probable date of the eclipse referred to.\nancient times it was customary to date such plates on the very day of the eclipse, as it was considered to add to the merit of the gift, but there were doubtless exceptions to the rule, and this may have been one of them. It is very interesting to note that the signature of S\u0101l\u0101v\u0101hana himself appears on the plate in a somewhat defaced but quite legible form, and from this we may conclude that it had been his intention to make the grant himself, and that he was prevented from doing so by his deposition and probable death. The son was thus only carrying out his father's wish.\n\nNow if we count back seven years from A.D. 1066, we get A.D. 1059-60 as the probable date of the invasion of Ananta Deva, and of Soma Varma's accession, and in any case that invasion cannot have been later than A.D. 1060, nor much earlier than A.D. 1050. From this date to A.D. 1870, the year in which R\u0101j\u0101 Sri Sing died, there were 37 R\u0101j\u0101s in consecutive order, during a period of 810-20 years, giving an average reign of 22 years. Again from A.D. 1589 to 1870, a period for which there are authentic and reliable data, there were 11 R\u0101j\u0101s in 281 years, with an average reign of 25 years. General Cunningham allows 25 years to each reign, but this seems excessive; an average of 20 years would appear to be safer. Now there were, according to the hansuli, 26 R\u0101j\u0101s from Maru, the founder of the State, to S\u0101l\u0101v\u0101hana, whose reign came to an end not later than A.D. 1060. Allowing an average reign of 20 years we arrive at A.D. 540-50 as the approximate date for the founding of the State, which is thus proved to be one of the most ancient native principalities in India. The original capital, as we know, was at Br\u0101hmaur in the Upper R\u0101vi Valley, where numerous traditions are still current concerning many of the ancient R\u0101j\u0101s, and there are also archaeological and epigraphical remains, which afford a remarkable corroboration of the conclusion which has been reached as regards the antiquity of the State. These have recently been carefully examined by Dr. Vogel of the Archaeological Survey, with interesting results. There are three inscriptions on brass in Br\u0101hmaur, and one in Chatr\u0101ri, a village half-way between Br\u0101hmaur and Chamb\u0101. Of these one is on the pedestal of a brazen bull of life size, standing in front of the temple of Mani Mah\u0113sa, the erection of which is traditionally ascribed to Meru Varma, who was the eighth R\u0101j\u0101 in succession from Maru. The two other inscriptions at Br\u0101hmaur are on the pedestals of the idols Lakshana Dev\u012b, and Ganesha, and that at Chatr\u0101ri is similarly on the pedestal of the image of Shakti Dev\u012b; and the erection of these idols is traditionally attributed to the same R\u0101j\u0101. The inscriptions themselves which have now been translated confirm these popular traditions. The name of Morn Varma is found in all of them, and it is stated that the idols were dedicated by his order. Even more interesting is the fact that in two of these inscriptions,\u2014those of Lakshana Dev\u012b, and Ganesha,\u2014the R\u0101j\u0101 traces back his own ancestry for three\ngenerations, and mentions the names of his father, Div\u0101kara Varma; his grandfather, Bala Varma; and his great-grandfather, Aditya Varma. Two of these names are found in the bansauli in a modified form, which leaves no doubt as to their identity with the names in the inscriptions. The third\u2014that of Bala Varma\u2014seems to have been omitted at a very early period, probably in the process of copying. The name of Aditya Varma is found as Adi Varma in the bansauli, while that of Div\u0101kara Varma occurs as Deva Varma, both in the bansauli and in the Chhitr\u0101ri inscription. There is unfortunately no date on any of these inscriptions, but Dr. Vogel has come to the conclusion, from a careful examination of the characters in which they are written, that they cannot be assigned to a later period than the early part of the eighth century, and that they probably date from the very beginning of that century. The name of Meru Varma is evidently out of its proper place in the bansauli, as it stands fifth in succession after Div\u0101kara Varma, who was his father. Correcting the bansauli by the inscriptions which are more reliable, we find that Meru Varma reigned from A.D. 680 to 700, or a little later, and this is in accordance with the conclusion at which Dr. Vogel has arrived. A further proof that these inscriptions are contemporary is afforded by the fact that all of them were executed by the same workman, whose name was Gugga, as shown on the inscriptions themselves. This also is in agreement with common tradition, by which the name of Gugga has been handed down to the present day.\n\nWith all those data at our disposal it becomes a comparatively easy matter to fix an approximate date for the founding of the present capital. The bansauli is very explicit as to the founder, and here again common tradition is in full accord. His name was S\u0101hila Varma, and he was the 20th R\u0101j\u0101 in succession from Maru, the founder of the State. S\u0101lav\u012bhana Varma, whose reign came to an end not later than A.D. 1060, was the sixth R\u0101j\u0101 after S\u0101hila Varma, and by deducting six reigns, or 120 years, from A.D. 1060, we find that S\u0101hila Varma must have ruled from about A.D. 920 to 940. His reign was probably a long one, and it may have been in the earlier part of it, say A.D. 930, that the town of Chamb\u0101 was founded, and the seat of government transferred thither from Br\u0101hmaur. From that time onwards to the present day there is an almost unbroken chain of historical evidence, furnished partly by the Chronicle, which is full and clear, and still more by a series of copper-plate title deeds\u2014about one hundred and fifty in number. The oldest of these yet discovered bears the name of Yug\u016bkar Varma, the son and successor of S\u0101hila Varma. The date on this plate is a year of his reign, and the same is true of the plates of Vidagdha Varma, his son, and of Soma Varma and \u0100sata Varma, sons of the deposed R\u0101j\u0101 S\u0101lav\u012bhana Varma, who followed their\n\n(1) He also mentions Moshuna or Mushuna, the progenitor of his race.\n(2) From ancient times it seems to have been the custom for every Chamb\u0101 Chief, on his accession, to make a grant of land to a Br\u0101hma\u1e47a or a temple. As many as 45 of these plates are known to have been given in the course of one reign.\nfather in succession. Here, however, the R\u00e1j\u00e1tarangini again comes to our aid, and from it we learn that \u00c1sata Varma visited K\u00e1shmir, on which Chamb\u00e1 was then dependent, in A.D. 1087-8; his son J\u00e1sata Varma in A.D. 1101; and his grandson Udaiya Varma in A.D. 1122. Udaiya Varma's name is probably misplaced in the bansauli, and a correction has to be made in accordance with the R\u00e1j\u00e1tarangini; otherwise these dates agree with the Chronicle.\n\nThe first plate which bears a distinct date is that of Vair\u00e1si Varma. This date is Sh\u00e1stra 6, Vik. 1387=A.D. 1380. The Vikram\u00e1ditya era appears to have only then begun to come into use in Chamb\u00e1. Previous to this the era in common use was the Loka-k\u00e1la or Sh\u00e1stra era; otherwise called the Saptarshi, or era of the Seven Rishis. It is identical with the Lankika or K\u00e1shmiri era of the R\u00e1j\u00e1tarangini, which was in use in K\u00e1shmir, and throughout the hills from the earliest times, and is still in common use in Chamb\u00e1 State along with the Vikram\u00e1ditya and Christian eras. The Sh\u00e1stra era is a cycle of 2,700 years, each century being named after one of the 27 Nakshatras, or lunar mansions. The reckoning is never carried beyond 100, and each century as it comes to an end is entirely left out of computation. The first year of each century of this era corresponds to the 24th year of each Christian century. Though this era probably was in use in Chamb\u00e1 from the earliest times, it does not appear to have been employed to record public events; at any rate, no trace of any such use has yet been found previous to the eleventh century (1).\n\nIt is found, however, on most of the copper-plates from that of Vair\u00e1si Varma onwards. From that time there is clear and exact testimony from the plates, confirmatory of the bansauli. In all of them is mentioned the name of the reigning R\u00e1ja, by whom the grant was made, also usually the name of his father, and often of his mother, and sometimes that of an ancestor. The earlier plates are without a date, but the later ones have the date carefully recorded, usually both in the Sh\u00e1stra and Vikram\u00e1ditya ears. Generally, too, the name and date of the month, and in a few cases the day of the week on which the plate was given, are stated, and in some of the plates there are other details which are of historical interest.\n\nIt is unnecessary to pursue this subject further, except to remark that an examination of the records of other existing and extinct States would doubtless add much to our knowledge of Chamb\u00e1 history, as well as throw light on the general course of events in the Western Him\u00e1laya in former times.\n\nThe bansauli.\n\nThe R\u00e1jas of Chamb\u00e1 belong to the S\u00e1ravyansi line of R\u00e1jp\u00fats; and their bansauli begins from Vishnu or N\u00e1r\u00e1yana. (2) R\u00e1ma, the hero of the R\u00e1m\u00e1yana, is sixty-third in the order of descent, which\n\n(1) Inscribed stones bearing the name Trilokya Deva, probably a R\u00e1ja, have Sh\u00e1stra dates of the first half of the eleventh century.\n\n(2) A tradition, current in Chamb\u00e1 and found in the bansauli, traces the descent of the Chamb\u00e1 R\u00e1jas from the R\u00e1ja of Udaipur. This is improbable as the latter are descended from Loh, the eldest son of R\u00e1ma.\nis continued through Kusha, the second son of R\u00e1ma. The original home of the family is said to have been in Ayodhy\u00e1, but they removed at a very early period to the Upper Ganges Valley, where they settled in Kal\u00e1pa. The historical portion of the bansauli commences with the name of Maru who was then the head of the family, and contains sixty-six names including that of the present ruling Chief.\n\nMaru is said to have been at first a religious devotee, whose life was given up to tapas or self-mortification. He afterwards married, and three sons were born to him. When they reached manhood he bestowed a kingdom on each of them. Leaving the eldest in the ancestral home, he traversed the Panj\u00e1b with the other two, and settled one of them in the mountains near Kashmir. Accompanied by Jaistambh, the youngest, he then penetrated to the Upper R\u00e1v\u00ed Valley through the outer hills, and having conquered that territory from the petty R\u00e1j\u00e1s who held it, he founded the town of Brahmapura, (1) and made it the capital of a new State. This event is believed to have taken place about the middle of the sixth century, A.D.\n\nThe original State was of very small extent, and in all likelihood comprised, at the most, only the present Br\u00e1hmaur wiz\u00e1rat, i.e., the valley of the R\u00e1v\u00ed from below Bara Bang\u00e1hal, with its tributaries the Budhil and the Tund\u00e1hen, as far down as Chhatr\u00e1ri.\n\nIt would appear that Maru's rule was not a long one, for the Chronicle says that, having founded the State, he made it over to his son, and returned to Kal\u00e1pa, where he again became a s\u00e1dhu.\n\nAfter Maru several R\u00e1j\u00e1s ruled in succession, but only their names are known. They were:\u2014 Jaistambh; Jalstambh; and Man\u00e1stambh.\n\nAditya Varma\u2014(c. A.D. 620).\u2014The name of this R\u00e1j\u00e1 appears as Adi Varma in the bansauli and is of very special interest, for it is twice mentioned in the Br\u00e1hmaur inscriptions, in which he is referred to as the great-grandfather of Meru Varma by whose orders they were engraved; and he was the first of the Chamb\u00e1 line to assume the title or suffix of 'Varma.' (2)\n\nThere are several references to Chamb\u00e1 in the Kul\u00fa Chronicle (3) and the earliest of these probably refers to Aditya Varma. It is to the effect that Brahmo P\u00e1l, R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Kul\u00fa, left no legitimate sons, and the R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Chamb\u00e1 (Brahmapura), Lad\u00e1kh, Suket, Bush\u00e1hir, K\u00e1ngra, and Bang\u00e1hal made one Ganesh P\u00e1l his heir. This note is interesting as showing that at that early period the\n\n---\n\n(1) The people believe that the place was named after Brahm\u00e1ni Dev\u00ed, the patron goddess of the Budhil Valley, whose shrine is situated a little way above the town. The name was in use, however, at a still earlier period, for the more ancient kingdom of Brahmapura, now British Garhwal and Kamaon. The present form of the word is Br\u00e1hmaur.\n\n(2) The Sanskrit word Varma (n) means \"armour, coat of mail; shelter, protection,\" and as the second member of a compound noun it means \"protected by.\" It was anciently used in R\u00e1jp\u00fat names, as Sarma (n) was in those of Br\u00e1hmans.\n\n(3) Vide \"Kul\u00fa, L\u00e1hul and Spiti\" by Captain Harcourt.\nCHAP. I. B. Brahmapura State was recognized by all the neighbouring kingdoms, and was powerful enough to exert some influence in their internal affairs.\n\nBala Varma\u2014(c. A.D. 640).\u2014The name of this R\u00e1j\u00e1 is not found in the bansauli; having been omitted probably by a clerical error. It occurs, however, in two of the Br\u00e1hmanur inscriptions, in which Bala Varma is spoken of as the grandfather of Meru Varma.\n\nDiv\u00e1kara Varma\u2014(c. A.D. 660).\u2014In the Br\u00e1hmanur inscriptions this R\u00e1j\u00e1\u2019s name is found in its full form; but in the bansauli, and the Chhatr\u00e1tri inscription, it occurs as Dev\u00e1 Varma.\n\nMeru Varma\u2014(c. A.D. 680).\u2014As the name of this chief stands fifth in the bansauli after that of the previous R\u00e1j\u00e1, who was his father, it is clearly out of its proper place. The error must have crept in at an early period, for all the existing copies of the bansauli are alike.\n\nMeru Varma seems to have been one of the most notable of the early Brahmapura rulers. He was probably the first to extend the State boundaries by conquest, for in the Chhatr\u00e1tri inscription it is recorded, that he dedicated the idol of Shakt\u00ed Dev\u00ed in gratitude for help against his enemies, whom he had attacked in their strongholds and overcome. An inscribed stone has recently been found at Gun which was erected by a s\u00e1manta or feudatory of Meru Varma, probably a R\u00e1j\u00e1, named Ash\u00e1dha. From this it is clear that Meru Varma\u2019s rule extended down the R\u00e1v\u00ed Valley almost as far as the present capital. There is also a note in the Kul\u00fa Chronicle which almost certainly refers to him. In the reign of Sri Dateshawar P\u00e1l, R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Kul\u00fa, there was war with Chamb\u00e1 (Brahmapura) in which the Kul\u00fa Chief was killed by Umer, R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Chamb\u00e1. There is no such name on the Chamb\u00e1 roll; but it seems probable that Umer is simply a transposition of Meru. Assuming this to be correct, it would appear that under Meru Varma the Brahmapura State asserted its power, and carried its arms successfully into one at least of the neighbouring principalities. This is confirmed by the further note in the Kul\u00fa annals that Amar P\u00e1l, R\u00e1j\u00e1 of that State, while defending his country from another inroad of the Brahmapura Chief, was slain with all his sons, except one. This son, S\u00edtal P\u00e1l, was an exile for life, and he and five of his descendants never reigned, from which it would seem that Kul\u00fa remained subject to Brahmapura for a considerable period.\n\nBut Meru Varma was not only a brave and warlike leader, he was also a great builder, and there are still in existence in Br\u00e1hmanur many interesting remains, some of which are known to date from his time. They prove that even at that early period of its history the State possessed a considerable measure of wealth and material resources. The remains consist chiefly of temples, in a remarkably good state of preservation in spite of their long exposure to the weather. Their names are Mani Mahes, Lakshana Devi,\n\n(1) Vide \"Kulu, Lahul and Spiti,\" pages 113-4.\nIn front of the Mani Mahes temple is a brazen bull of life size, on the pedestal of which is a long inscription. This and the other two inscriptions, in the temples of Lakshana Devi and Ganesha, distinctly ascribe the dedication of all the idols named, except that of Narsingh, and also of the brazen bull, to Meru Varma. Tradition affirms that the S\u00farajmukha Shrine was also built by him, and, in accordance with ancient custom, a Chamb\u00e1 R\u00e1j\u00e1, when visiting Br\u00e1hmaur, must pay his devotions at this temple before proceeding to his camp. The image of Shakti Devi at Chhatrari, with its inscription, has already been referred to as dating from the reign of Meru Varma. Lands are said to have been assigned for the support of these temples, but no title deeds have yet been found of an earlier date than the tenth century.\n\nMeru Varma was followed by several Raj\u00e1s, of whom we know nothing but the names. These were:\u2014 Mandar Varma; Kant\u00e1r Varma; Pragabha Varma.\n\nAjja Varma.\u2014(c. A.D. 760).\u2014The Gaddi Br\u00e1hmans and Rajputs have a tradition that they came to Br\u00e1hmaur from Delhi in the reign of this R\u00e1j\u00e1. It is also on record that when his son grew up to manhood Ajja Varma initiated him into the art of government, and then installed him as R\u00e1j\u00e1. He thereafter retired to the junction of the R\u00e1vi and Budhil rivers near Uk\u00e1s\u00e1, where he spent the rest of his life in the worship of Shiva; and is said to have been translated to heaven.\n\nSucarn Varma\u2014(c. A.D. 780).\n\nLakshmi Varma\u2014(c. A.D. 800).\u2014This R\u00e1j\u00e1 had not been long in power when the country was visited by an epidemic of a virulent and fatal character, resembling cholera or plague. Large numbers fell victims to the disease, and the State was in a measure depopulated. Taking advantage of the desolation which prevailed, a people bearing the name of 'Kira' in the Chronicle invaded Brahmapura, and, having killed the R\u00e1j\u00e1, took possession of the territory. It is uncertain who the Kira were. They are referred to in the Brihat Samhita in association with Kashmiris, but in such a manner as to show that the two nations were distinct from each other. Dr. Stein is of opinion that they occupied the mountains north-east of Kashmir, and they may therefore have been Tibetans, or Yarkandis, as is the belief in Chamb\u00e1. They also held Baijn\u00e1th in the Kangra Valley, which was anciently called Kiragrama. The name Kira seems also to have been applied to the Kashmiris.\n\nKul\u00e1 had probably remained under the sway of Brahmapura from the time of Meru Varma, but it recovered its independence.\n\n---\n\n(1) While the shrines of Lakshana Devi and Ganesha, at Br\u00e1hmaur, and of Shakti Devi at Chhatrari, almost certainly date from the time of Mohu Varma, the present temple of Mani Mahes is probably of later date; the original temple, however, was erected by Meru Varma, as proved by the inscription on the bull.\n\n(2) Vide Ancient Geography of India, page 93.\non the death of Lakshm\u00ed Varma, for the Kul\u00fa Chronicle states that its R\u00e1j\u00e1 obtained help from Bush\u00e1hir and expelled the Chamb\u00e1 (Brahmapura) troops.\n\nMushan Varma\u2014(c. A.D. 820).\u2014Lakshm\u00ed Varma left no son, but his r\u00e1n\u00ed was enceinte at the time of his death, and an interesting legend has come down to us regarding the birth of her child. On the defeat and death of the R\u00e1j\u00e1, the waz\u00edr and parohit, or family priest, had the r\u00e1n\u00ed put into a p\u00e1lki, and carried off towards K\u00e1ngra. On reaching the village of Garoh, a little beyond Deol, in the Trehta il\u00e1ga of the Upper Rav\u00ed Valley, she felt the pains of labour coming on, and desiring the bearers to put down the p\u00e1lki, went into a cave by the wayside, and there her son was born. Thinking it better to leave the infant to perish than run the risk of his capture by their enemies who were in pursuit, she left him in the cave, and returning to the p\u00e1lki resumed her journey. Suspicion was, however, aroused and, on being closely questioned, the r\u00e1n\u00ed confessed that she had given birth to a son, and left him in the cave. The waz\u00edr and parohit at once went back, and found the young prince, with a number of mice surrounding and keeping guard over him; and from this circumstance he was named Mushan Varma.(1) The villagers still shew the stone on which he is said to have been laid. Having recovered the child the party proceeded on their journey to K\u00e1ngra. There the r\u00e1n\u00ed took up her residence in the house of a Br\u00e1hman whom she made her guru; and remained eight or nine years under his protection, without disclosing her identity. One day the boy happened to tread on some flour sprinkled on the floor, and the Br\u00e1hman, on seeing his footprint, recognized it to be that of a royal person, and the mother being questioned made known her relationship to the Brahmapura royal family. The Br\u00e1hman thereupon conducted her and the child to the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Suket,(2) who received them kindly, and had Mushan Varma provided for, and carefully educated. He grew up intelligent and brave, and received the R\u00e1j\u00e1\u2019s daughter in marriage, and with her as dowry the pargana of P\u00e1ngna, and other large presents. Mushan Varma was also furnished with an army, and returning to Brahmapura he drove out the invaders and recovered his kingdom.\n\nNothing is on record about him after his return, but the killing of mice is said to have been prohibited by him on account of the services rendered by these animals in his infancy. This custom still obtains in the Chamb\u00e1 royal family, and a mouse caught in the palace is never killed.\n\nAfter Mushan Varma the following R\u00e1j\u00e1s ruled in succession, but nothing is known regarding any of them:\u2014Hans Varma; S\u00e1r Varma; Sen Varma; Sajjan Varma.\n\n(1) The name of Mausikanos of Alexander\u2019s historians, who ruled in Sindh, is derived by Lassen from the Sanskrit Maushika or mouse. See McCrindle\u2019s \u201cInvasion of India by Alexander the Great.\u201d\n(2) His name is given as Parbogh.\nSahila Varma\u2014(c. A.D. 920).\u2014This Raj\u00e1 holds a very conspicuous place in the State annals, for it was he who conquered the lower R\u00e1vi Valley, and transferred the seat of government from Brahmapura to the new capital, which he had founded at Champ\u00e1. It was probably in the beginning of his reign that another invasion of Kul\u00fa took place. The war lasted twelve years, and then a peace was patched up. The Kul\u00fa people invited the Brahmapura soldiers to a feast which was held at night, and in the darkness the latter were inveigled down to the banks of the Be\u00e1s near Rahia, where they fell over the precipices and were killed.\n\nShortly after Sahila Varma's accession Brahmapura was visited by 84 yogis, who were greatly pleased with the Raj\u00e1's piety and hospitality, and, as he had no heir, they promised him ten sons. They were invited to remain in Brahmapura till the prediction was fulfilled, and in due course ten sons were born, and also a daughter named Champ\u00e1vati.\n\nMeanwhile Sahila Varma had been engaged in extending his rule, and had brought under his sway all the petty r\u0101ndas who still held the lower portion of the R\u00e1vi Valley. On this expedition he was accompanied by Charpatn\u00e1th, one of the yogis, and also by his queen and daughter. Previous to its occupation by Sahila Varma, the plateau on which the town of Chamb\u00e1 stands was within the domain of a r\u0101nda, who had conveyed it in s\u0101san or gift to a family of Kanw\u00e1n Br\u00e1hmans. Champ\u00e1vati, the Raj\u00e1's daughter, took a great liking to the place, and asked her father to found a town and make it his capital. Sahila Varma was desirous of acceding to her wish, but all the land fit for building purposes had passed into the hands of the Br\u00e1hmans, and he was unwilling to dispossess them. At length an arrangement was effected, whereby, in recognition of their proprietary rights, eight chaklis\u2014Chamb\u00e1 copper coins\u2014were promised in perpetuity on the occasion of every marriage in the town. The land was given up, and the above condition has been observed ever since. The Raj\u00e1 then founded the town, and named it Champ\u00e1 after his daughter.\n\nAn interesting and pathetic legend has come down to us in connection with the settlement of the new capital. There was no good and convenient water supply, and the Raj\u00e1 was anxious to meet this need. He therefore had a water-course made from the Sarota stream round the shoulder of the Sh\u00e1h Mad\u00e1r Hill, behind the town. For some reason the water refused to enter the channel prepared for it, and, in accordance with the superstitious notions of the time, this was ascribed to supernatural causes. The spirit of the stream must be propitiated, and the Br\u00e1hmans, on being consulted\n\n---\n\n(1) This is the version in the Chronicle, but two other suppositions are possible. The place may have received its name from the Champ\u00e1 tree, which grows in the neighbourhood and even in the town itself, or it may have been named after the ancient Champ\u00e1, which stood near the modern Bh\u00e1galpur in Bengal. It is also possible that the name was already in use in the time of the r\u0101ndas.\nreplied that the victim must be either the r\u0101n\u012b or her son. Another tradition runs that the R\u0101j\u0101 himself had a dream in which he was directed to offer up his son, whereupon the r\u0101n\u012b pleaded to be accepted as a substitute. The R\u0101j\u0101 was unwilling to accede to her wish, and wanted to offer some one else, but she insisted that if there must be a sacrifice she should be the victim. Her wish prevailed, and, accompanied by her maidens, and bare-headed as for sat\u012b, she wended her way up the hill to the spot near the village of Balota, where the water-course leaves the main stream. There a grave was dug and she was buried alive. The legend goes on to say that when the grave was filled in the water began to flow, and has ever since flowed abundantly.\n\nYug\u0101kar, the son and successor of S\u0101hila Varma, mentions his mother's name in the only copper-plate of his reign which has been found. It was Nenna Dev\u012b, and she may possibly have been the r\u0101n\u012b referred to. In memory of her devotion a small shrine was afterwards erected by her husband on the spot, at the top of the present flight of steps, where she is said to have sat down to rest. A mela was also appointed to be held yearly, from the 15th of Chait to the 1st of Bais\u0101kh. It is called the S\u016bh\u012b Mela, and is attended only by women and children, who, in their gayest attire, climb the steps to the shrine, and there sing the r\u0101n\u012b's praises and present their floral offerings. They are all entertained at the R\u0101j\u0101's expense on this occasion. The steps are not ancient, having been constructed by R\u0101n\u012b S\u0101rda, queen of R\u0101j\u0101 Ajit Singh, A.D. 1794\u20141808.\n\nThere can be little doubt that the legend is founded on fact. Such a sacrifice was quite in keeping with the spirit of the times, and it is noteworthy that the mela has been held from time immemorial, affording strong proof of the truth of the story as related. It is significant, too, that, although a death in the royal family during any other mela necessitates its immediate suspension, this does not apply in the case of the S\u016bh\u012b mela which is never interrupted.\n\nAnother legend has also been handed down by tradition in connection with the founding of the Champ\u0101vat\u012b or Chamasni Temple, probably the first erected by S\u0101hila Varma in Chamb\u0101. His daughter Champ\u0101vat\u012b was of a religious disposition, and used to visit the place of a s\u0101dhu for conversation. Suspicion was instilled into her father's mind, and he followed her on one occasion with a drawn sword in his hand, only however to find that the house was empty. As he entered, a voice came from the stillness upbraiding him for his suspicions, and telling him that his child had been taken from him as a punishment. He was further commanded to erect a temple to her on the spot where he stood, to atone for his sin, and avert calamity from his house. The temple was accordingly built, and named after his daughter, who is there worshipped as a goddess.\nIt is regarded as the family temple of the Chamb\u00e1 R\u00e1j\u00e1s, and a mela has been held in connection with it from time immemorial, from the 1st to the 21st Bais\u00e1kh. Until recent years it was customary for the ruling Chief to make a daily visit during the mela to certain temples in fixed rotation, always returning to that of Champ\u00e1yati, but this custom has now fallen into disuse. S\u00e1hila Varma also erected several other temples in Chamb\u00e1, which are still in existence. The earliest of these are believed to have been the Chandragupta and K\u00e1meshwara Temples, built for two idols of Shiva which he took out of the S\u00e1l stream near its junction with the R\u00e1v\u00ed. This he did while bathing, under the guidance of Charpatn\u00e1th.\n\nOf the other temples erected by S\u00e1hila Varma the principal one is that of Lakshmi N\u00e1r\u00e1yana, or Vishnu, in association with which a curious legend has been preserved. Being desirous of raising a temple to Vishnu, the R\u00e1ja sent nine of his sons to the marble quarries in the Vindhya Mountains, to bring a block of marble for an image. They were successful in this mission, but on beginning to cut the slab it was found to contain a frog. As this was considered to render it unsuitable for the primary purpose for which it was intended, the slab was used in making some smaller images. These were the Trimukha, or three-faced image of Shiva; a small image of Ganpat now in the Chandragupt Temple; and also that of a small goddess, possibly Lakshmi, wife of Vishnu. The young princes were sent to bring another block, but were all killed by robbers on their way back. On this news reaching Chamb\u00e1, S\u00e1hila Varma sent his eldest son Yug\u00edkar, who was also attacked, but, receiving help from some Sany\u00e1s\u00ed gos\u00e1ins, he destroyed the robbers, and returned with a slab, from which the image of Vishnu was made, and set up in the temple prepared for it. S\u00e1hila Varma is also said to have built the Chandrasekhara Temple at Saho, for an idol found in the S\u00e1l stream near that place.\n\nWhen all the temples were finished, lands were assigned for their support; but no copper-plates of S\u00e1hila Varma\u2019s time have yet been found.\n\nThe original palace at Chamb\u00e1 must also have been erected by S\u00e1hila Varma, and it doubtless occupied the same site as the present building.\n\nIn all matters connected with the settlement of the new capital the R\u00e1ja was guided by the advice of the yogi Charpatn\u00e1th; and in recognition of this a shrine was afterwards erected to him near the Lakshmi N\u00e1r\u00e1yana Temple, where p\u00faja is done morning and evening. This shrine is ascribed to S\u00e1hila Varma, but it probably dates from a later period.\n\n(1) Recent research by Dr. Vogel has shown that the original temple of Chandrasekhara was erected about the time of S\u00e1hila Varma, by a local chief, probably a r\u00fand, named S\u00e1tvaki.\nThe only coin special to Chamba is the chakli, five of which make an anna, and it has been in use, in all likelihood, from ancient times. On it S\u0101hila Varma caused to be struck a pierced ear, the symbol of a yogi, in honour of Charpatn\u0101th, and this has been continued down to the present day. The later R\u0101j\u0101s added the Vishnu-pad, or feet of Vishnu on their coins. There is no tradition of a silver coinage ever having been current.\n\nS\u0101hila Varma stands out as the most conspicuous personality on the long roll of the Chamb\u0101 Chiefs; and his name is a household word throughout the State. Though his son Yugikar makes no special reference to him in the copper-plate of his reign, there are reasons for believing that his martial qualities were recognized far beyond the bounds of the State, and that his conquests were not confined to the R\u0101vi Valley. Two copper-plates have lately come to light in which some of the events of his reign are alluded to; and after making due allowance for hyperbole and exaggeration, it seems probable that the references are founded on fact. The first of these plates was granted by Soma Varma, and the second by Soma and Asata, sons of S\u0101l\u0101vih\u0101na Varma; they date from A.D. 1056-66, i.e., about 120 years after S\u0101hila Varma\u2019s death, when his name and fame would still be fresh in the memory of the people; and deserve mention in this history. For the translation we are indebted to Dr. Vogel of the Archaeological Survey. After the customary introduction it runs as follows:\n\n\"From his residence at the glorious Champ\u0101ka, the highly devout king (Soma Varma), an ornament of the spotless house of S\u0101hila Deva, who (S\u0101hila) was a fresh rain-cloud to extinguish in a moment the mighty blazing fire of the Kira forces; fanned as by the wind by the Lord of Durgara, assisted by the Saumatika; whose army was manifestly crushed by the fearful frown on his brow; whose alliance was humbly sought by the ruler of Trigarta, subdued by force; who was asked the favour of his bestowing royalty in return for services, by his kinsman the Lord of Kuluta, anxious to render him homage; who by the weight of battle had broken, like a wide-spreading tree the large force of the Turushkas, on whom wounds had been inflicted; who bore the fortunate name of Karivarsha (elephant rain) on account of the continuous and stable generation of his posterity, joyfully granted by the Lord Bh\u0101skara (the Sun-god), whose mind was made fully contented with gladness by the gift of a multitude of elephants, whose flat cheeks were covered with a swarm of bees, attracted by the scent of the rut-secretion, and which were bestowed in Kurakahetra at the time of an eclipse; who has made the circuit of the seven worlds fragrant by his fame, painted with the inkbrushes, which were the months of all the princes assembled on that occasion; who by his unequalled kindness and compassion, combined with unsurpassed bravery, generosity, firmness, and unfathomable profoundness has impaired the fame of heroes like the son of Jamadagni (Parasur\u0101ma), Sivi, Karna, Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira; whose wide-spread greatness, brilliant with matchless effulgence, was renown\u2019d like that of Sudrakasv\u0101mi-deva; by looking upon who a lovely presence the eyes of the world have been made fruitful; who, by his fury in setting in array a thousand battalions, acquired such names as S\u0101has\u0101\u1e45ka...\"\nWith one exception all the names in the quotation are fairly well known, and the references are of great historical interest. As regards the Kira, we have seen that they were a people located in the mountains in the vicinity of the Kashmir Valley, and associated with the Kashmiris. They conquered Brahmapura in the time of Lakshmi Varma, and they are here represented as having again invaded the State. It is safe to assume that the Kashmiris were in league with them, and they were also assisted by the Raja of Durgara, the ancient name of Jammu State, of which the present form is Dugar, still in common use. Who the Sanmatika were is not quite certain, but most likely the inhabitants of Sumurta, in the Basohli State to the west of the Ravi, are indicated. Kashmir had from ancient times claimed an intermittent suzerainty over the hill tracts as far east as the Ravi; and the formidable army which is represented as advancing against Sahila Varma was probably meant to assert and uphold this claim. They doubtless anticipated an easy victory, but a crushing defeat awaited them; for they are spoken of as having been dispersed by the Chamb\u00e9 forces as if by a frown on the Raja's brow.\n\nThe next reference is to Trigarta, the ancient name of Kangra, which at that early period also included Jalandhar and a large portion of territory on the plains, between the Sutlej and the Ravi. We are told that Sahila Varma's alliance was sought by the Trigarta Chief after a contest in which Chamb\u00e9 was victorious. With such a name for valour we may well believe that Sahila Varma's conquests were not confined to the Ravi Valley; and the war with Trigarta suggests the probability of the Chamb\u00e9 Chief having carried his arms to the south of the Dhaua Dh\u00e1r, and annexed the whole southern fringe of that range, from the Ravi to Bir Banghal. There are said to be many traditions in Kangra, pointing to an early occupation of these territories by Chamb\u00e9.\n\nKuluta is the ancient name of the principality of Kul\u00e1, and we are told that it owned allegiance to Chamb\u00e9 in the time of Sahila Varma, as it had done at an earlier period. The two royal families were also connected by marriage.\n\nThe reference to the Turashka is in some respects the most interesting of all. This name was applied to all invaders of India from the North-West. Originally used for the Scythians, it came afterwards to have an exclusive reference to the Mubammadans, who from the middle of the seventh century had begun to make their influence felt on the North-West frontier. Kabul was conquered by them in A.D. 871. The Turk\u00ed-Sh\u00e1hi dynasty, which had ruled Kabul and Peshawar for centuries, was overthrown about A.D.\nCHAP. I. B.\n\nHistory.\n\nSahila Varma, A.D. 920.\n\nWars with the Turushka.\n\n900, by the Brahman Wazir of the last Turk\u00ed-Sh\u00e1hi king, who founded the Hindu-Sh\u00e1hi dynasty, with its later capital at Ohind on the Indus. There this dynasty continued to rule over the kingdom of Gandh\u00e1r\u00e1, till finally expelled by Mahm\u00fad of Ghazni in A.D. 1021. As we learn from the R\u00e1jatarangini, these kings were in alliance with Kashmir, and also doubtless with other States in the Panjab, which was for a long time in subjection to them. We may, therefore, conclude that contingents were sent by these States to help to oppose the onward advance of the fierce invaders from the West; and it was most probably in one of these frontier wars that Sahila Varma came into conflict with the Turushkas, and gained renown for himself by his valiant deeds.\n\nReference to Kurukshetra.\n\nThe reference to Kurukshetra is in full accord with ancient custom in India.\n\nSahila Varma did not spend the last years of his life in Chamb\u00e1; probably the home of his early days had greater attractions for him. We may well believe that his reign was a long one in view of all that he accomplished; and when his work was done, and old age was creeping upon him, he abdicated in favour of his son Yug\u00e1kar, and retired to Brahmapura to spend the evening of his life in peace. There he dwelt as a s\u00e1dhu in the company of Charpatnath and the other yog\u00eds, many of whose shrines are still pointed out on the small 'green' where all the temples stand, and which for this reason is called the 'Chaur\u00e1si.' For the same reason the Chamb\u00e1 State is believed to have been originally subdivided into 84 ildq\u00e1s, but they are less numerous now.\n\nYug\u00e1kar Varma\u2014(A.D. 940).\n\nThere is nothing on record in the Chronicle with regard to this R\u00e1ja subsequent to his accession, but a copper-plate deed which bears his name is still extant. It was granted in the tenth year of his reign, and is of interest as being the oldest yet discovered in Chamb\u00e1. Its interest is enhanced by the fact that Yug\u00e1kar refers to his father and mother by name, and also probably to his queen, Tribhuvanarekh\u00e1 Dev\u00ed. The deed conveyed a grant of land to the Narsingh Temple at Brahmapura, which is spoken of as having been erected by the 'R\u00e1ni,' presumably his own or his father's queen. Yug\u00e1kar himself erected the temple of Ishwar Gaurja, or Gauri-Shankar, in Chamb\u00e1, near that of Lakshmi N\u00e1r\u00e1yana.\n\nVidagdha Varma\u2014(c.A.D. 960).\n\nA copper-plate of this R\u00e1ja's time is extant. Granted in the fourth year of his reign, it mentions his father Yug\u00e1kar, and his mother Bhogmat\u00ed Dev\u00ed. The R\u00e1ja speaks of himself as of the house (gotra) of Moshuna\u2014a name found in the Brahmuir inscriptions.(1)\n\n(1) An inscribed stone, found near Basu, is dated in the first year of Vidagdha Varma, and was erected by a vassal, probably a rasa.\nDodaka Varma\u2014(980).\u2014In the bansauli Yug\u00e1kar Varma is followed by a R\u00e1j\u00e1 named Daghda Varma. An inscribed stone, recently found near Basu, contains, in consecutive order, the names of Yug\u00e1kar, Vidughda, and a third R\u00e1j\u00e1, named Dodaka, by whose order the stone was inscribed. It seems certain that this is the same name as the \u2018Daghda\u2019 of the bansauli, with the syllables transposed. Dodaka was therefore the son of Vidaghda and grandson of Yug\u00e1kar, and as, in the inscription, he assumes the royal style and titles he must have been the ruling R\u00e1j\u00e1 at the time the stone was inscribed.\n\nVichitar Varma\u2014Dhairya Varma.\n\nS\u00e1lav\u00e1hana Varma\u2014(A. D. 1040).\u2014The name of this R\u00e1j\u00e1 does not appear in the bansauli, and his very existence was unknown until the discovery of three copper-plates, in all of which he is mentioned. (1)\n\nWith his reign another interesting period in the history of the State is reached. Kashmir, as we have seen, had from ancient times asserted a claim to the suzerainty of the hill tracts on her borders, as far east as the R\u00e1v\u00ed. There were probably long intervals during which this claim was in abeyance, or when, as in the time of S\u00e1hila Varma, it was impossible to enforce it; and the State then enjoyed complete independence. This would appear to have been the case from a period anterior to the reign of S\u00e1hila Varma, but it was now near an end. In A. D. 1028, Ananta Deva succeeded as a child to the throne of Kashmir; and when he grew up to manhood the claim of supremacy seems to have been revived, and was resisted by the Hill Chiefs. Chamb\u00e1 was then, as we learn from the R\u00e1j\u00e1tarangini, under the rule of a R\u00e1j\u00e1 named S\u00e1la, who for long was identified with S\u00e1hila Varma. It would seem that he refused to yield allegiance to Kashmir, with the result that his country was invaded, and himself defeated, deposed, and probably killed. There is no allusion to this event in the Chronicle, but, for reasons already stated, we may conclude that it occurred not later than A. D. 1060, nor earlier than about A. D. 1050: and V\u00e1l\u00e1pura or Balaur\u2014another small Hill State on the R\u00e1v\u00ed\u2014was invaded by Ananta Deva about the same time, and presumably for the same reason.\n\nWe learn from the plates that S\u00e1lav\u00e1hana had two sons\u2014Soma Varma and \u00c1sata Varma\u2014who ruled in succession.\n\nSoma Varma\u2014(A. D. 1060).\u2014After deposing S\u00e1lav\u00e1hana, the King of Kashmir is said to have set up another in his place, and that this was Soma Varma is clear from the plates, though his name, like that of his father, is entirely absent from the bansauli. The first deed is signed by Soma Varma alone, and was granted in the seventh year of his reign, on the occasion of a solar eclipse, probably September, A. D. 1066. It is on this plate that the\n\n(1) The Hari Rai Temple was erected by S\u00e1lakara, who probably was the same as S\u00e1lav\u00e1hana.\nsignature of S\u00e1lav\u00e1hana appears, showing that he had intended to make the grant himself, which he was prevented from doing by his deposition and death. On it the r\u0101\u1e47\u0101s are also referred to under the name of Rajanaka, and in such a manner as to indicate that some of them at least held high offices in the State.(1) The second deed made a grant of land in favour of Shiva and Vishnu, and is now in the possession of the Champ\u00e1vat\u00ed and Hari R\u0101i Temples. It is dated in the first year of Asata's reign, and is signed by both brothers, with an additional grant in the eleventh year, signed by Asata. The long quotation relating to S\u0101hila Varma is found almost word for word in both of these plates, except the reference to the Turushka, which appears only in the second plate.\n\nAsata Varma\u2014(A. D. 1080).\u2014The first plate of this R\u0101j\u0101 has already been referred to, and another, the third in which his father's name is mentioned, was granted in the fifth year of his reign.\n\nThough the bansauli is silent, strong corroborative evidence is furnished by the R\u0101jatarangini where it is stated that \"Asata, R\u0101j\u0101 of Champ\u00e1,\" visited Kashmir in the winter of A. D. 1097-8, in the reign of Kalasha, son of Ananta Deva, who, like his father, asserted the claim of suzerainty over Chamb\u00e1, and other Hill States. That this claim was widely acknowledged is proved by the fact that the rulers of seven other hill principalities, from Chamb\u00e1 to Urasa or Haz\u00e1ra, were present in Kashmir at the same time as Asata Varma. It would thus appear that, after the invasion of Ananta Deva, the State remained more or less dependent on Kashmir for a considerable period. There were also inter-marriages between the two ruling families, for Kalasha had as his queen a sister of Asata, whose name was Bappika, and her son Harsha succeeded to the throne on his father's death.\n\nJ\u00e1sata Varma\u2014(A. D. 1105).\u2014The Chronicle furnishes no information about this R\u0101j\u0101, but he is referred to in the R\u0101jatarangini as affording support to Harsha, his own cousin, in A. D. 1101, when Kashmir was invaded by the princes of the Lohara family, who claimed the throne. On that occasion he was taken prisoner by Sussala, in the temple at Vijayeshvara (Bijbehara). He must, however, have been only heir-apparent at that time, as a stone inscription, found at Luji in P\u00e1ngi, is dated in the first year of his reign, Sh. 81 = A.D. 1105, which must therefore have been the year of his accession. The use of the \u015a\u0101stra era is noteworthy as being the earliest certain instance yet found in Chamb\u00e1. As the stone, which formed part of a panih\u0101r or water-fountain, was erected by a vassal, probably a r\u0101\u1e47\u0101, P\u00e1ngi must have been, even at that early period, under the supremacy of Chamb\u00e1. In A. D. 1112 J\u00e1sata is again mentioned in the R\u0101jatarangini as supporting Bhikshah\u0101r\u0101,\n\n(1) One held the Office of Mah\u0101m\u0101t\u1e5bya (Prime Minister), another that of Mah\u0101k\u0101p\u0101nt\u0101l\u012bka (Lord Chancellor).\ngrandson of Harsha, against Sussala who had then usurped the throne of Kashmir. Being unsuccessful Bhiksh\u00e1chara retired to Chamb\u00e1, and lived there for four or five years as the R\u00e1j\u00e1's guest.(1) J\u00e1sata's reign must therefore have lasted till about A. D. 1117-8. Another inscribed stone of J\u00e1sata's reign exists at Loh-Tikri in Chur\u00e1h and is dated in his 9th year = A. D. 1114.\n\nDh\u00e1la Varma\u2014(A. D. 1118).\u2014He is said to have been brother of the previous R\u00e1j\u00e1, and his reign must have been short.\n\nUdaiya Varma\u2014(A. D. 1120).\u2014The name of this R\u00e1j\u00e1 seems to be out of its proper order in the bansauli, for it stands fifth after that of J\u00e1sata. As the latter reigned till about A. D. 1118, and Udaiya Varma is mentioned in the R\u00e1j\u00e1tarangini as having been in Kashmir in A. D. 1122, it seems improbable that four reigns intervened in such a short period. Chamb\u00e1 had now changed sides in the struggle which was going on for the throne of Kashmir, and Udaiya Varma lent his support to Sussala, who had been opposed by J\u00e1sata. The change of attitude was most likely due to the fact that, in the interval, Sussala had espoused two princesses of the Chamb\u00e1 family, whose names were Devalekh\u00e1 and Taralalekh\u00e1, both of whom became sat\u00ed on the death of Sussala, in A. D. 1128. Kashmir was now in a very unsettled condition, owing to internal dissensions which had been going on for some time. Kalasha, the son of Ananta Deva, was succeeded by Harsha, who, with his son Bhoja, was killed in A. D. 1101, and the throne seized by the Lohara Princes, Uchchala and Sussala. On the death of his father, and loss of the kingdom, Bhiksh\u00e1chara, son of Bhoja, then a child, was taken away to M\u00e1lwa. Returning from there in A. D. 1112, he fell in with a party of Hill Chiefs at Kurukshetra, among whom was his own relative J\u00e1sata of Chamb\u00e1, and they encouraged him to attempt the recovery of his kingdom. In this he had the support of Chamb\u00e1, V\u00e1ll\u00e1pura, and some of the Th\u00e1kurs in the Chandrabh\u00e1g\u00e1 Valley. Being defeated he retired to Chamb\u00e1, where as already stated, he resided for some time under the protection of J\u00e1sata Varma. Another attempt in A. D. 1120 resulted in his being restored to power, which however he retained only for six months. It is probable that Chamb\u00e1 had changed sides previous to this, for when in A. D. 1121-2 Sussala made a successful effort to regain the throne, he had the active support of Udaiya Varma. Kashmir was now on the decline, and these disorders, and the Muhammadan invasions which had been in progress for more than a century, tended to still further weaken its power. Chamb\u00e1 seems to have taken advantage of this to assert its independence; at any rate there is no further reference to the State in the R\u00e1j\u00e1tarangini.\n\nAfter Udaiya Varma the following R\u00e1j\u00e1s ruled in succession, but no information about them is available:\u2014Ajita Varma; Deht\u00e1ri Varma; Prithvi Varma.\n\n(1) He evidently was unwelcome as he had difficulty in procuring food and clothin from the R\u00e1j\u00e1.\nLalita Varma\u2014(A.D. 1143).\u2014Two slab inscriptions of this R\u00e1j\u00e1's reign have recently been found. One of these is dated in his 17th year, and records the erection of a panih\u00e1r, or fountain, at Debr\u00ed Koth\u00ed, by a R\u00e1n\u00e1 named N\u00e1ga P\u00e1l, who states that he had received the title of R\u00e1j\u00e1naka from the R\u00e1j\u00e1. The other inscribed stone is at S\u00e1lhi in the Saichu N\u00e1l\u00e1, P\u00e1ng\u00ed, and is dated in the 27th year of Lalita Varma, Sh. 46=A.D. 1170. This R\u00e1j\u00e1 must therefore have begun to reign in A.D. 1143-4, and may have lived till about A.D. 1175. The second slab\u2014part of a panih\u00e1r\u2014was erected by a R\u00e1n\u00e1 named Ludar P\u00e1l, whose lineal descendants still hold land in S\u00e1lhi, as common farmers. In it P\u00e1ng\u00ed is called P\u00e1ngat\u00ed, which seems to have been the ancient name of the Valley.\n\nVijaya Varma\u2014(A.D. 1175).\u2014This prince is said to have been brave and warlike, and was much beloved by his people. The Chronicle states that he invaded Kashmir and Lad\u00e1kh, and brought back much spoil. The State boundaries were enlarged during his reign.(1) If we bear in mind the political condition of Northern India about this period, we shall have little difficulty in understanding the easy successes which Vijaya Varma seems to have gained. In A.D. 1191 Muhammad of Ghor invaded India, and was defeated by the confederate Hind\u00fa Princes, under the leadership of Prithvi R\u00e1j of Delhi. He returned in A.D. 1193, and, in the great battle which ensued on the banks of the Ghaggar, Prithvi R\u00e1j perished with the flower of his army. In the following year Kanauj also was overthrown, and everywhere confusion and disorder reigned. There is thus little room for surprise that Vijaya Varma availed himself of the opportunity to extend the boundaries of the State.\n\nHe was succeeded by R\u00e1ja Varma; S\u00e1ra Varma; Kirti Varma; Ajita Varma; Madana Varma, brother of the previous R\u00e1j\u00e1; N\u00e1r\u00fakanjar Varma; Asha Varma; Jim\u00fat Varma.\n\nVair\u00e1si Varma\u2014(A.D. 1330).\u2014This R\u00e1j\u00e1 is called Vair\u00e1 Varma in the bansauli, but a copper-plate deed gives his name as above. It bears the date Sh\u00e1stra 6, Vik. 1387=A.D. 1330, which was probably the first year of his reign. This is the first plate with a distinct date, and for this reason it is both interesting and important. Vair\u00e1si Varma had probably a long reign, and died about A.D. 1370.\n\nM\u00e1nikya Varma\u2014(A.D. 1370).\u2014The name of this Chief occurs on the copper-plates of his son Bhot Varma, the earliest of which is dated A.D. 1397. We may, therefore, assume that this was the year of his death.\n\nBhot Varma\u2014(A.D. 1397).\u2014The earliest plate of this reign has just been referred to, and the latest yet found has the date Sh. 12=A.D. 1436. There is an allusion to Bhot Varma's death in a deed granted by his son, from which it appears that this event took place in A.D. 1442.\n\n(1) His sway is said to have extended to Gujr\u00e1t.\nSangram Varma (A.D. 1442).\u2014The plates of this reign afford no assistance chronologically, as the dates of all but one are uncertain.\n\nAnand Varma (A.D. 1475).\u2014The only dated plate of this Raja was granted in Sh. 57 = A.D. 1481, but his reign probably began some years earlier. His mother's name was Sampurna Devi. Anand Varma was very religious, and was believed to have the power of working miracles. He espoused the daughter of the Raja of Kangra, and in order to test his miraculous powers the dishes at the marriage feast were purposely placed so far from him as to be out of his reach. A vessel with three spouts was also given him to drink from. This, however, caused no inconvenience to the Chamba Chief. Whatever he wanted came towards him of its own accord; and, when he took up the glass to drink, snakes protruded from two of the spouts and stopped them, enabling him to use the third. Anand Varma died about A.D. 1512.\n\nGanesh Varma (A.D. 1512).\u2014The first plate of this reign was granted in Sh. 88, Saka 1434 = A.D. 1512, and the last in Sh. 35 = A.D. 1559.\n\nGanesh Varma's reign was thus a very long one. In several plates the name of his son, Pratap Singh Varma, occurs, and he is styled 'Yuvraj' and 'Maharajputra.' These plates furnish the earliest instances of the use of the cognomen 'Singh' in the Chamba family.\n\nGanesh Varma built the fort of Ganeshgarh in the Mothila ilaq to protect his frontier, and consolidate his power to the south of the Dhauja Dhar. This was done probably towards the end of his reign, when the signs of the times began to point to the near approach of that Mughal supremacy, which was soon to overshadow all the Hill States of the Punjab. Chamba had probably enjoyed complete independence for more than 400 years; for the early Muhammadan rulers of India were too much engrossed in defending or extending their possessions on the plains to attempt the conquest of the inner mountains. Kangra, it is true, was invaded once and again, and the famous fort captured and recaptured; but there is no evidence that these inroads extended beyond the Siwalik. With the rise of the Mughal power this immunity and freedom came to an end. Akbar the Great, then a boy of 14, ascended the throne in A.D. 1556. When the news of his father's death arrived he was at Kalanaur in the Gurdaspur District, having been engaged in the pursuit of Sikandar Shah Suri, who retreated before him into the hills. Immediately after his accession the young Emperor advanced against the Kangra Fort, which he reduced, and he then received the Katoch Chief into favour. In A.D. 1558, Sikandar Shah emerged from his retreat in the hills, and occupied the fort of Mankot, half way between Pathankot and Nurpur and within the Nurpur State, which he held for eight months, and on\n\n---\n\n(1) Mankot is called Mankot in Elphinstone's History of India, page 431.\nits capitulation the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of N\u00farp\u00far, who had sided with him, was taken to Lahore and executed. There were thus good grounds for apprehension on the part of the other States; and it is probable that Mughal influence had begun to make itself felt in Chamb\u00e1 previous to the death of Ganesh Varma in A. D. 1559.\n\nGanesh Varma had six sons, viz., Prat\u00e1p Singh, Jit Singh, Bfr Bah\u00e1dur, Hari Singh, Satargun Singh, Rup\u00e1nand Singh. It is noteworthy that almost all of them bore the second name 'Singh,' which was now coming into general use, but it did not entirely displace the older name of Varma for fully half a century, and Prat\u00e1p Singh Varma, the next R\u00e1j\u00e1, used both names synchronously.\n\nPrat\u00e1p Singh Varma (A. D. 1559).\u2014This R\u00e1j\u00e1 is called the son of Ganesh Varma and S\u00e1hib Dev\u00ed on the copper-plates of his reign, of which there are many extant. He is said to have been very generous, and considerate of the well-being and comfort of his people. This was shown specially in his unwillingness to impose heavy taxation upon them. The Lakshmi Nar\u00e1yana Temple was in need of repairs, and the erection of other temples was under contemplation; but there was no money in the treasury for this purpose. Prat\u00e1p Singh Varma called a council of his officials to ask their advice, and they all recommended the imposition of a tax. This course, however, did not commend itself to the R\u00e1j\u00e1, as it meant a new burden on his subjects. He was much concerned about the matter, but next morning, on taking his seat in Darb\u00e1r, a man presented himself from the Hul il\u00e1q\u00e1 with a piece of copper in his hand, and said that a copper mine had been discovered near his village. The R\u00e1j\u00e1 at once issued orders for the working of the mine, and, with the produce, repaired all the temples, and built some new ones. The mine then became exhausted, or was closed, but the old workings may still be seen.\n\nSoon after this, war broke out between Prat\u00e1p Singh Varma and the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Kangra, whose name is given as Chandar P\u00e1l.(1) As the second name of the Kangra R\u00e1j\u00e1s has always been 'Chand' it is clear that a mistake has crept into the Chronicle. The surname of the Bang\u00e1hal R\u00e1j\u00e1s was 'P\u00e1l' and it is just possible that the war was with that State, Kangra coming to the assistance of its weaker neighbour. In any case the main struggle seems to have been with Kangra, and it ended in the defeat of the Katoch forces, and the death of Jit Singh, the younger brother of the Kangra R\u00e1j\u00e1. Much booty in horses and elephants was taken, and Chari and Gharoh, two small districts near the Chamb\u00e1 border, were annexed. Guler, the capital of the Guler State, is said to have been occupied by the Chamb\u00e1 army, and from this it seems probable that the war was only with the Guler branch of the Katoch family of Kangra. It would be interesting to know if there is any record of this war in the Katoch annals.\n\n(1) The vernacular b\u00e1nsakr\u00fa has been followed in this narrative; in the Sanskrit b\u00e1nsakr\u00fa the R\u00e1j\u00e1's name is 'Chandra,' and he is called \"the king of Nag\u00e1r-kot\" (Kangra). There is no mention of Guler.\nPrat\u00e1p Singh Varma was contemporary with Akbar, and it seems probable that early in his reign the whole of the Hill States, including Chamb\u00e1, became subject and tributary to the Mughal Empire. Soon afterwards Todar Mal, the great finance minister of Akbar, was deputed by his master to create an imperial demesne in K\u00e1ngra by confiscating territory from the various States of the K\u00e1ngra group. In accordance with his instructions, Todar Mal annexed a large portion of the K\u00e1ngra Valley, and made a similar demand on each of the other States proportionate to their means. Chamb\u00e1 was compelled to surrender Rihlu and all the territory it then held to the east of that province; as also the two small districts of Chari and Gharoh recently acquired from K\u00e1ngra. The imperial demesne thus formed was placed under a Mughal officer of rank who had his residence in the K\u00e1ngra Fort. In presenting his report to his royal master Todar Mal is said to have made use of the metaphor that he had \"taken the meat and left the bone\"; meaning that he had annexed the fertile tracts, and abandoned only the bare hills to the Hill Chiefs.(1) There was much truth in this remark as regards Chamb\u00e1, for Rihlu was the most fertile portion of the State.\n\nFrom this time onwards for nearly 200 years Chamb\u00e1, like the other Hill States, was in subjection to the Empire; but all accounts agree that the Mughal authority sat very lightly on the Hill Chiefs. Their prerogatives were seldom questioned, and there was practically no interference in their internal administration. Indeed, throughout the whole period of Muhammadan ascendancy, the Hill Chiefs seem to have experienced liberal and even generous treatment. So long as they did not fail in their allegiance, they were left very much to themselves in the government of their principalities; and were allowed to wield the power and exercise the functions of independent sovereigns. For example, they built forts, and waged war on one another, without any reference to, or interference from, the Emperor, and sometimes even asked and received assistance in men and arms from the Mughal Viceroy. On his accession each Chief had to acknowledge the supremacy of the Emperor by the payment of a fee of investiture, after which he received a sanad, or patent of installation, with a khilat, from the Imperial Darb\u00e1r. A yearly tribute, called peshkash, of four l\u0101khs of rupees was exacted from the States of the K\u00e1ngra group in the time of Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n, as we learn from the B\u00e1dsb\u00e1hnam\u00e1. The Hill Chiefs were always addressed as Zam\u00ednd\u00e1r, the title of B\u00e1j\u00e1 being conferred only as a personal distinction. There seems to have been much friendly intercourse between them and the Imperial Court, as is proved by the letters and valuable presents received from the Emperors, which are still in the possession of some of the old royal families.(2) Some of the Chiefs gained for\n\n(1) K\u00e1ngra Settlement Report, p. 8. The Mughal officer had the title of Faujd\u00e1r.\n(2) There are two such letters in Chamb\u00e1, and also presents said to have been given to R\u00e1j\u00e1 Prithvi Singh by Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n. There are also several letters from the Dur\u00e1n\u00ed rulers of K\u00e1bul. Vide Appendix V.\nthemselves so high a place in the favour of the Emperors that they received *mansab*, or military rank, in the Imperial army, and were advanced to important offices in the State. As we shall see, such a distinction fell to the lot of one at least of the Chamb\u00e1 R\u00e1j\u00e1s.\n\nThere is some doubt as to how much of L\u00e1hul was under Chamb\u00e1 in early times, but it seems probable that from the tenth or eleventh century, if not from an earlier period, the main Chandra-bh\u00e1ga valley, as far up as Tandi near the junction of the two rivers, was included in State territory. Many traditions are said to exist in L\u00e1hul, pointing to this conclusion, and the people of Gus, on the left bank, say that they once owned a copperplate deed, granted by a Chamb\u00e1 R\u00e1ja, which was taken from them after the country was annexed to Kulu.\n\nOn the right bank these traditions are not so clear, owing probably to the fact that the country was more open to invasion, and must often have changed hands. The rest of L\u00e1hul, including the valleys of the Chandra and Bh\u00e1ga, seems to have been under Kulu from early times. In the Kulu annals it is stated that L\u00e1hul was conquered by Chamb\u00e1 in the reign of Rudar P\u00e1l, the nineteenth R\u00e1ja from the founder of the Kulu dynasty, but was recovered by Kulu in the following reign, after a hard contest on the Rhotang Pass; and though these records are more or less legendary, yet they confirm the conclusion that in early times L\u00e1hul was under the rule of Kulu and Chamb\u00e1. In the middle of the twelfth century Kulu, with the upper portion of L\u00e1hul was conquered by Lad\u00e1kh, and remained subject to that country, more or less, till about A.D. 1660-70. Chamb\u00e1, however, maintained its supremacy over the greater part of the main valley, and seems also to have gained some influence in upper L\u00e1hul, for the Kulu annals state that the territory now embraced in British L\u00e1hul, and formerly a part of Kulu, was acquired by that State from Chamb\u00e1.\n\nThe latest plates of Prat\u00e1p Singh Varma are dated Sh. 62\u2014A.D. 1586, and he probably died in the same year. In one of his plates, dated Sh. 55, Vik. 1635\u2014A.D. 1579, Bala Bhadra Deva, his grandson, is called Yuvar\u00e1j\u00e1 and Tika; though V\u00edr V\u00e1hnu, his son, was alive, and succeeded to the *gaddi*. The title was probably accorded to both father and son.\n\n**V\u00edr V\u00e1hnu (A.D. 1586).**\u2014This R\u00e1ja was in power for only four years at the most, as his son Bala Bhadra succeeded in A.D. 1589\u2014the year in which his earliest plate is dated. No plate of this reign has yet been found.\n\n**Bala Bhadra (A.D. 1589).**\u2014This Chief stands out conspicuous among his contemporaries on account of his reputed piety, great generosity, and the many legends which are associated with his name. He was profuse in his gifts to Br\u00e1hmans, and at least 42 copper plates of his reign are known to be extant. There may be more. By his people he was named Bali-Karna, after two heroes of antiquity famous for their generosity. He bestowed grants of land and other gifts upon Br\u00e1hmans in a most lavish manner; and regarded this as his highest and most imperative duty, refusing even to eat each morning till this duty had been\n\n---\n\n(1) Possibly the Th\u00e1kurs of upper L\u00e1hul paid tribute both to Chamb\u00e1 and Kulu.\n(2) This is the earliest instance of the use of the title Tika in Chamb\u00e1.\n(3) Such grants were not confined to Chamb\u00e1, for plates have recently been found in N\u00farp\u00e1r and Kangr\u00e1.\ndischarged. The grants of his reign are far in excess of those of any other Chamb\u00e1 Chief either before or since. No petitioner was sent away disappointed, and, if a request was made to him, the R\u00e1j\u00e1 used to part with any article which was lying near, regardless of its value. He gifted grants of land to the Lakshmi Narayana Temple, as well as many jewels, and other valuables, some of which are still in existence. Each of them is enclosed in a golden case with an inscription on it, one of these bearing the date Vik. 1675 = A.D. 1619.\n\nThese lavish gifts seem to have gone on for some years, and to such an extent that the State administration became seriously embarrassed. The officials were much concerned, and tried to dissuade the R\u00e1j\u00e1 from such profuse liberality, but their remonstrances only made him angry, and were met by a sharp rebuke. At length, owing to the excessive drain on the treasury, there was difficulty in meeting ordinary and necessary State expenditure. Just then Jan\u00e1rdan, the R\u00e1j\u00e1's eldest son, came of age, and the officials begged him to intervene by removing his father from power. This was accordingly done, and Bala Bhadra was deported to the village of Baraia on the other side of the R\u00e1vi, and a house and lands were assigned for his support.\n\nBut there also Bala Bhadra is said to have continued his lavish gifts, and soon the whole of the land assigned him was alienated to Brahmins. As nothing now remained to him but the house he lived in he was in great straits. Being under the necessity of giving before eating, he began to part with his house at the rate of a foot each morning, and, when in this way a whole verandah or room had been disposed of, he ceased to use it, considering that it was no longer his property. In course of time the whole building was thus gifted away, and the R\u00e1j\u00e1 then vacated it, and lived in the open, at the same time refusing to eat. On this being reported to his son, Jan\u00e1rdan gave his father a fresh grant of land to enable him to continue his benefactions.\n\nNo reference to the deposition is to be found in the Chronicle; but the traditions regarding it are so clear and definite that they must have a foundation in fact. There is some obscurity as to the year in which it took place, but a consideration of all the data available leads to the conclusion that it cannot have been later than A.D. 1619. This conclusion is sustained by an existing record, evidently compiled from older documents, in which the period of Bala Bhadra's deposition is given as Vik. 1670\u201480 = A.D. 1618-23. Some light is thrown on the subject by an examination of the copper plates of his reign. These are all carefully dated, and extend from A.D. 1589 to 1641, the year of his death. Only two marked breaks occur in the regular continuity of these plates, one between A.D. 1599 and 1607, and the other between A.D. 1620 and 1629. In all of them Bala Bhadra is referred to in terms\nwhich imply that he was recognised as R\u00e1j\u00e1; and the grants are not limited to one locality, but are widely distributed, and are still in the possession of the descendants of the original grantees. Another plate recently found was issued by Jan\u00e1rdan in A.D. 1613, and in it also Bala Bhadra is spoken of as R\u00e1j\u00e1. In it Jan\u00e1rdan is called \"Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 Kund\u00e1ra,\" \"Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1putra\" and \"Mie,\" i.e., Mian, and the fact of the plate having been issued by him points to the conclusion that he was then in authority in the State, and that he only acted as regent, and did not assume full power in his own name. The issue of the plate probably marks the beginning of his regency. In the bansuli Jan\u00e1rdan's name is found after that of his father in the regular order of succession.\n\nShortly after Jan\u00e1rdan assumed the government, war broke out between him and the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of N\u00farp\u00e1r. The cause of this war is not known, but it was probably due to an attempt on the part of the N\u00farp\u00e1r Chief to enlarge his borders at the cost of Chamb\u00e1. At that time, as we know, Jagat Singh, second brother of S\u00faraj Mal, the then R\u00e1j\u00e1 of N\u00farp\u00e1r, stood high in the favour of the Emperor Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr, and if he originated the war with Chamb\u00e1, as he is said to have done, he doubtless counted on obtaining support from the Mughal Viceroy of Lahore. It is certain, however, that Jagat Singh was not R\u00e1j\u00e1 of N\u00farp\u00e1r at the time the war began, for he did not obtain that position till after the rebellion and death of his brother, S\u00faraj Mal, in A.D. 1618-9.\n\nThe war went on in a desultory manner for twelve years without either side gaining any decided advantage; and there seem to have been intervals of peace. This was the case in A.D. 1618, for we learn from the B\u00e1dsh\u00e1h\u00e1n\u00e1ma that, when S\u00faraj Mal rebelled and was compelled by the Imperial army to flee from N\u00farp\u00e1r, he found a temporary refuge in one of the Chamb\u00e1 forts, and ultimately retired to the capital. There he was joined by his youngest brother, M\u00e1dh\u00f3 Singh, who had for a time defended the Kotila Fort. As the Imperial forces were preparing to advance against Chamb\u00e1, news came that S\u00faraj Mal was dead. The Mughal Commander then sent a peremptory order to the Chamb\u00e1 Chief to surrender all money and valuables belonging to the deceased R\u00e1j\u00e1 on pain of his highest displeasure. This order was complied with, the property being sent through the son and the brother of the R\u00e1j\u00e1. M\u00e1dh\u00f3 Singh also was given up. On his brother's rebellion, Jagat Singh was recalled from Bengal by the Emperor, who conferred on him the mansab of 1,000 with 500 horse, the title of R\u00e1j\u00e1, and a present, and he was sent to assist in the siege of Kangra Fort, which was then in progress. He also became R\u00e1j\u00e1 of N\u00farp\u00e1r in succession to S\u00faraj Mal. Hostilities seem to have been resumed with Chamb\u00e1 soon afterwards, and ultimately the Mughal Viceroy\n\n---\n\n(1) A copper plate is extant, by Bala Bhadra, conferring a sasan grant on the parchit of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Jagat Singh, and dated A.D. 1618.\nespoused the cause of Jagat Singh, and sent troops to his support. A decisive battle was fought at Dhalog on the Sandh\u00e1ra Road; the Chamb\u00e1 army was defeated, and Bishambar, Jan\u00e1rdan\u2019s younger brother, killed. Jagat Singh then advanced on the capital, which he captured and sacked\u2014while Jan\u00e1rdan, unable to offer any effective resistance, fled. A treacherous message was then sent him by Jagat Singh\u2014offering terms of peace if he would present himself in Darb\u00e1r to discuss them. Jan\u00e1rdan, suspecting nothing, accepted the invitation, and came with only a few followers. While they were engaged in conversation, Jagat Singh suddenly drew his dagger and plunged it into Jan\u00e1rdan\u2019s breast, inflicting a mortal wound. The latter also had a dagger in his waistbelt, but the handle was tied to the sheath by a cord, so that he could not draw it in time to defend himself. Owing to this the Chamb\u00e1 R\u00e1j\u00e1s have ever since worn the dagger loose in the sheath. The date of Jan\u00e1rdan\u2019s death was probably in A. D. 1623. The fact of his having been killed by Jagat Singh is confirmed by a statement to that effect in the B\u00e1dsh\u00e1h\u00e1n\u00e1m\u00e1.\n\nIn the bansauli it is stated that Jan\u00e1rdan left no heir, but his r\u00e1n\u00ed was enceinte, and that, on learning this, Jagat Singh gave orders that a strict watch should be kept on the palace. If the infant proved to be a boy he was at once to be killed, and if a girl she was to be married into the N\u00farp\u00far family so as to strengthen his hold on the State. When the child, afterwards Prithv\u00ed Singh, was born, his nurse, named Batlu, is said to have smuggled him out of the palace, without the knowledge of the guards, and conveyed him away to Mandi. Recent research has shown that the birth story is not quite correct. A second plate, granted by Jan\u00e1rdan and dated Magh Sambat 1595\u2014February A. D. 1619, records a s\u00e1san grant to a Brahman on the occasion of the birth of his son, Prithv\u00ed Singh, who must therefore have been born before his father\u2019s death. There is, however, no reason to doubt the fact of his having been conveyed away to Mandi.\n\nOn Jan\u00e1rdan\u2019s death the State became subject to Jagat Singh, and is said to have been ruled by his officials for 20 years.\n\nHe built the fort of T\u00e1r\u00e1garh within Chamb\u00e1 territory as there was no site so good in his own country. This fort is said to have received its name from the fact that a farmer named T\u00e1ra was buried alive beneath the foundations as a sacrifice to ensure its stability, according to a custom common in India in former times. The stronghold occupied a conspicuous position on the summit of an almost inaccessible hill near the Chamb\u00e1-N\u00farp\u00far frontier, and its ruins are still visible from a distance. It stood Jagat Singh in good stead at the time of his own rebellion in A. D. 1641.\n\n(1) This tragedy is said to have taken place in the palace at Chamb\u00e1.\n(2) T\u00e1r\u00e1garh consisted of three forts, one above another, the highest being perched on the summit of the hill. It covered an area of about 30 acres, and had 12 fortified gateways.\nSome uncertainty still exists regarding the status of Bala Bhadra during the period of N\u00farp\u00far supremacy, but it seems probable that on Jan\u00e1rdan's death he was restored to power, and continued till his death to rule the State in subjection to Jagat Singh. No plates have yet been found of the years from A. D. 1620 to 1629. From A. D. 1629, however, the issue of plates was resumed and continued till the early spring of A. D. 1641. His death must have occurred soon afterwards, shortly before the return of his grandson Prithv\u00ed Singh in the summer of the same year. The record containing the date of his deposition states that he died in Vik. 1699=A. D. 1642, but this is probably incorrect. In the later plates two other sons are referred to by name\u2014M\u00e1n Singh and Sudar Sen\u2014and the names of other sons have been handed down by tradition.\n\nPrithv\u00ed Singh\u2014(A. D. 1641).\u2014After he grew up to manhood, Prithv\u00ed Singh, who was still in Mandi, only awaited a favourable opportunity to strike a blow for the recovery of his kingdom. The opportunity came in A. D. 1641, when Jagat Singh, in conjunction with his son R\u00e1jr\u00fap Singh, raised the standard of rebellion against Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1n. Till now Jagat Singh's career had been fortunate and successful. Under Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr he rose to a mansab of 3,000 with 2,000 horse; and during the reign of Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1n he retained his honours, and was appointed to Bangash,(1) and two years later to K\u00e1b\u00fal, where he greatly distinguished himself. In the eleventh year of Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1n's reign, he was sent from K\u00e1b\u00fal to Kandah\u00e1r with the Imperial army, and had command of the vanguard. In the twelfth year he returned to Lahore, received presents from the Emperor, and was again appointed Faujd\u00e1r of Bangash. In his father's absence R\u00e1jr\u00fap Singh was in charge of the State, and was appointed by Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1n to the important post of Faujd\u00e1r of K\u00e1ngra, and collector of the tribute from the Hill Chiefs. In the spring of A. D. 1641, in secret concert with his father, who was then in Bangash, he rebelled. Jagat Singh pretended anger, and asked to be made Faujd\u00e1r himself, so that he might suppress the revolt, and pay in the nazard\u00edn of four l\u00f3khs. This request was granted, but on his return to the hills, he first showed discontent, and then broke out into open revolt. We are not told what was the cause of the trouble, but the Path\u00e1n\u00ed Chiefs were ever turbulent, and this was by no means the first time they had raised their hands against the Emperors. Court intrigues against him are hinted at by Jagat Singh, in his petition to Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1n.\n\nOn the news of the outbreak reaching the Imperial ear, a large army under the command of Prince Mur\u00e1d Bakhsh, youngest son of the Emperor, with many able captains, was sent to suppress it, and assembled at Path\u00e1nkot,(2) in August A.D. 1641.\n\n(1) The Kurram Valley and Koh\u00e1t. Vi. Proc. Asiatic Society of Bengal, 1872, p. 156.\n(2) Called Faithan in the B\u00e1dhsh\u00e1h-n\u00e1m\u00e1.\nThe Chronicle makes no mention of Jagat Singh's rebellion, but it was doubtless on hearing of it that Prithvi Singh asked and obtained help in money and troops from the Rajas of Mandi and Suket, to enable him to recover his kingdom. Passing through Kulu, he crossed the Rhotang Pass into Lahul, and, advancing by way of Pangi, crossed the Cheni pass into Churah, the northern province of the State. This he reconquered and fought his way to the capital, which he captured, expelling the Nurpur officials from the country. We may assume that these events occurred in the summer of A.D. 1641, for early in December of that year Prithvi Singh was present in the Mughal Camp near Pathankot and was sent on to the Imperial Court, probably then in Lahore, to pay his respects to the Emperor.\n\nJagat Singh offered a brave resistance to the overwhelming force sent against him. He had long been preparing for a struggle, and had strongly fortified the three principal strongholds in his territory. These were Maukot, Nurpur and Taragarh. All the hill passes and ways of approach were also blocked and defended by his troops. Maukot was only a fortified enclosure with dense jungle around it, but it was a position of great strength. Jagat Singh decided on making his first stand there, while Nurpur was entrusted to some of his officers. Both of these forts were invested by the Imperial army in the middle of October, and the siege was pressed with great vigour. By the middle of December Jagat Singh's position in Maukot had become untenable, so he abandoned it and along with his sons fled to Taragarh. Two days afterwards the defenders of Nurpur also evacuated that fort, on hearing of the fall of Maukot.\n\nAll this we learn from the Badshahnama, and though the narrative does not actually say so, it seems to imply that Prithvi Singh was present at the siege of Maukot or Nurpur. It is as follows:\u2014\"On the 23rd of Ramzan (16th December A.D. 1641) the highborn prince (Prince Murad Bakhsh), in accordance with the sublime orders, sent Prithvi Chand, the Zamindar of Champa, whose father had been killed by the outcast Jagat Singh, and who was at this time enrolled among the royal servants on the recommendation of the ministers of the State, to the royal threshold, the abode of great kings, along with Alla Vaidi Khan and Mir Buzurg, who had gone to bring him.\"\n\n\"Prithvi Chand, the Zamindar of Champ\u00e1, was honoured with a khilat, an inlaid dagger, the title of 'Commander of one thousand,' and the actual command of four hundred horsemen, the title of\n\n(1) Maukot was situated about half way between Pathankot and Nurpur, on a ridge of low hills running to the east of the Chakki. The place is near Jajja ka Bagh, and is still called Mauwa da ban, but only vestiges of the fortifications now remain. It is called the \"Fort of Man\" in the Badshahnama.\n\n(2) During the siege Rajrop Singh was sent to the Mughal camp under a safe conduct with a letter to the Emperor proposing terms of surrender, but they were not accepted.\n\n(3) Maukot was captured on 19th December and Nurpur on 15th December A.D. 1641.\nR\u00e1j\u00e1 and a horse. As the mountain on which Jagat Singh had laid the foundations of the fort of T\u00e1r\u00e1g\u00e1rh was in Chamb\u00e1, and had been taken by the R\u00e1j\u00e1 with violence; and as the back of the fort joined on to the above-mentioned territory, and had in that direction an eminence commanding it, the possession of which was essential to the taking of the fort, he was ordered to go home that he might make the necessary preparations to deliver an attack with a proper force from the back of the fort, and, capturing the eminence, reduce the besieged to straitened circumstances.\" It was probably in consequence of this order that Prithv\u00ed Singh sent to Sangr\u00e1m P\u00e1l of Basohli for help, for which he surrendered to Basohli, the pargana of Bhalai.(1)\n\nAs soon as arrangements were complete, the Imperial army in the end of December advanced to the assault of T\u00e1r\u00e1g\u00e1rh. On his return form Chamb\u00e1 with his force, Prithv\u00ed Singh took up his position on the ground assigned him, in conjunction with R\u00e1j\u00e1 M\u00edn Singh of Gwalior, who is spoken of as \"the mortal enemy of Jagat Singh.\" By the beginning of March, A.D. 1642, the garrison was reduced to great straits, and Jagat Singh, realising that his cause was hopeless, sued for pardon, and in company with his sons surrendered himself to the clemency of the Emperor. They appeared in Darb\u00e1r with halters round their necks, and after making their submission, were not only pardoned but restored to all their honours.(2) On the conclusion of the war, T\u00e1r\u00e1g\u00e1rh was taken over by the Mughals and garrisoned by Imperial troops.(3)\n\nThe account of these occurrences in the Chronicle differs from that of the B\u00e1dsch\u00e1hn\u00e1ma. It is as follows:\u2014\"On recovering his kingdom Prithv\u00ed Singh determined to avenge himself on Jagat Singh. He, therefore, concluded a league with Sangr\u00e1m P\u00e1l of Basohli, and surrendered to him the pargana of Bhalai, after which both R\u00e1j\u00e1s went to the Mughal Viceroy at Kal\u00e1nour to ask help. This was granted on condition that Jagat Singh should be taken alive, and made over to the Viceroy. The R\u00e1j\u00e1s with their forces then advanced upon N\u00farp\u00far, which they assaulted and captured, but the final assault having been made at night, Jagat Singh escaped in the darkness to T\u00e1r\u00e1g\u00e1rh, where he was taken a month afterwards, and sent on to the Viceroy, seated on a buffalo with his face backwards.\"\n\nHaving recovered his kingdom, Prithv\u00ed Singh next addressed himself to its consolidation and extension. His advance through P\u00e1ng\u00ed had made him personally acquainted with that valley, which was still under the rule of the local r\u00e1n\u00e1s, subject to the supremacy\n\n(1) For some reason unknown Prithv\u00ed Singh, in A.D. 1648, claimed the retrocession of Bhalai, and his claim was upheld by the Imperial delegate though not enforced till the following reign. Vide Appendix V.\n\n(2) Jagat Singh was restored to his honours on 10th April, A.D. 1642, and afterwards rendered distinguished service to the Emperor in the Afgh\u00e1n wars in which he was accompanied by his son, R\u00e1j\u00fap Singh; but the exposure he endured undermined his health, and he returned to Pesh\u00e1war in January, A.D. 1646, only to die. Vide Elphinstone's History of India, p. 511.\n\n(3) According to popular tradition the siege lasted 12 years. The surrender took place on 11th March and Jagat Singh, with his sons, appeared before the Emperor on 17th March A.D. 1642.\nof Chamb\u00e1. These he displaced, and appointed his own officials, thus bringing the country directly under State control. A rock-inscription bearing his name exists between Kil\u00e1r and S\u00e1ch, where the river flows through a narrow gorge, and it probably records the fact that, in S. 18\u2014A.D. 1642, the precipice was cut away by his orders for the construction of a road. He was the first to build koth\u00eds, or State offices, in Chur\u00e1h and P\u00e1ng\u00ed.\n\nAfter completing the consolidation of his kingdom, Prithv\u00ed Singh went on pilgrimage to Pray\u00e1g, K\u00e1shi and G\u00e1ya. He is also said to have visited Delhi nine times in the reign of Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n, and to have been received with much favour\u2014a j\u00e1g\u00edr in Jasw\u00e1n of Rs. 26,000 value being granted him by the Emperor, which continued to be attached to the State for ninety years. There are still in the toshakh\u00e1na many valuable presents, especially inlaid daggers, and a jewelled sirpaich with a large sapphire in it, which were received by Prithv\u00ed Singh on the occasion of his visits to Delhi. The family idol of the Chamb\u00e1 R\u00e1j\u00e1s, called Raghub\u00edr, is said to have been obtained from Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n on one of these occasions. It had originally been used as a weight in the Mughal Palace.\n\nTradition says that Prithv\u00ed Singh was a very handsome man, and his fame spread through Dehli to such a degree that the ladies of the royal zan\u00e1na begged to be allowed to see him. He was accordingly led blind-folded into the harem that they might have their wish gratified.\n\nPrithv\u00ed Singh was married to a daughter of Sangr\u00e1m P\u00e1l, of Basohli, and had eight sons, whose names were Shatru Singh, Jai Singh, Indar Singh, Mah\u00edpat Singh, Raghun\u00e1th Singh, R\u00e1m Singh, Shakat Singh, and Raj Singh. From this time onwards the old cognomen of Varma was entirely dropped.\n\nAmong the Gaddi Khattr\u00eds of Br\u00e1hmaur there is a tradition that their ancestors fled from L\u00e1hore in the time of Prithv\u00ed Singh to escape the persecutions of Aurangzeb. It is probable, however, that this took place at a much earlier period.\n\nThe temple of Khaj\u00edn\u00e1g at Khaji\u00e1r, Hidimb\u00e1 at Mahla, and S\u00edt\u00e1 R\u00e1m at Chamb\u00e1, are believed to have been erected in this reign by Batlu, the nurse who was the means of saving Prithv\u00ed Singh\u2019s life.\n\nChatar Singh (A.D. 1664).\u2014This R\u00e1j\u00e1\u2019s name was Shatru Singh, as appears from the copper plates, but Chatar Singh is the name in common use. On his accession, he appointed Jai Singh, his brother, to the office of Waz\u00edr, and sent him to Sangr\u00e1m P\u00e1l, of Basohli, to demand the restoration of the Bhalai il\u00e1q\u00e1, alienated by his father. This demand being refused, Chatar Singh invaded Basohli and re-annexed Bhalai to Chamb\u00e1. He visited P\u00e1ng\u00ed, and\n\n(1) In connection with this tradition the following popular rhyme is of interest:\u2014\n\nUjriya Labor, Vasiya Brahmor.\n\nLahore became waste; Br\u00e1hmaur was peopled.\n\n(2) She also built a bridge over the R\u00e1vi at N\u00e9lhora near Chamba, called Duku ra se\u00fa, or Duku\u2019s bridge; so named after her husband.\ncarried his arms lower down the Chandrabh\u00e1ga valley, into P\u00e1dar, which had till then remained in the possession of its r\u00e1n\u00e1s, though probably under the suzerainty of Chamb\u00e1. These he removed from all authority, and appointed his own officials. He also founded a town on the plain and named it Chatargarh. Being an emporium of the Central Asian trade, a good deal of which then passed through N\u00farp\u00far and Chamb\u00e1 to Z\u00e1nskar and Lad\u00e1kh, the town grew and flourished, until A.D. 1836; when it was completely destroyed by the Dogras, and the name changed to Guk\u00edbgurh.\n\nIn A.D. 1678, the Emperor Aurangzeb issued an order for the demolition of all Hindu temples in the State. Chatar Singh refused to render obedience, and directed that a gilt pinnacle should be put on each of the chief temples in Chamb\u00e1 as a mark of defiance. On hearing this the Emperor was greatly incensed, and summoned the R\u00e1j\u00e1 to Delhi. Instead of going himself he sent his brother Shakat Singh, who was accompanied by R\u00e1j Singh of Guler, but for some reason unknown they turned back from Bajwara, before reaching Delhi. Chatar Singh seems to have been able to allay the Emperor's wrath, but there is no record as to how the matter was finally settled. The gilt pinnacles remain on the temples to the present day.\n\nAt that time Mirza Obed Beg, the S\u00e1ba or Viceroy of the Panj\u00e1b, who resided chiefly at Kal\u00e1naur, used to make incursions into the hills, and greatly annoyed the Hill Chiefs. This led to a confederation being formed against him, in which were included Chatar Singh of Chamb\u00e1, R\u00e1j Singh of Guler, Dhir\u00e1j P\u00e1l of Basohli, and Krip\u00fal Deo of Jammu. Jammu sent a force of Path\u00e1n troops, and the confederate army defeated that of the Viceroy, enabling the Chiefs to recover the territory they had lost.\n\nIt was probably in the beginning of Chatar Singh's reign that L\u00e1hul was finally divided between Chamb\u00e1 and Kulu. Till then as we have seen Chamb\u00e1 territory extended up to the junction of the Chandra and Bh\u00e1ga; the remainder of L\u00e1hul being under Kulu and subject to Lad\u00e1kh. In consequence of the invasion of Lad\u00e1kh by Eastern Tibet in A.D. 1646-47 the power of the former country was much weakened, and R\u00e1j\u00fa Bidhi Singh, of Kulu, A.D. 1663\u201474, took advantage of this to throw off his allegiance and expel the Lad\u00e1kh\u00ed officials from L\u00e1hul. Soon afterwards Chamb\u00e1 lost the upper part of the main valley. The Kulu annals state that L\u00e1hul was acquired as dowry with a Chamb\u00e1 princess, but this is improbable. It seems more likely that the transfer of territory was the result of war and conquest, as is hinted at in the local tradition of Kulu. There seems to be no authority for the statement that Gug\u00e9 in upper Kan\u00e1war had gained a footing in L\u00e1hul, and that Chamb\u00e1 and Kulu combined to expel the invader and then divided the country between them.\n\n(1) Vide Kulu, L\u00e1hul and Spiti, p. 39. R\u00e1j\u00fa Udai Singh (A.D. 1590-1720) visited L\u00e1hul in the early part of his reign, possibly in connection with the boundary dispute with Kulu. Udaipur near Tribhuvan was named after him.\n\n(2) Vide Appendix V.\nChatar Singh died in A.D. 1690, leaving two sons, Udai Singh and Lachman Singh.\n\nUdai Singh\u2014(A.D. 1690).\u2014The new reign began auspiciously. The young R\u00e1j\u00e1 was well read and accomplished, the people were happy and contented, and the country was prosperous. Jai Singh, brother of the late R\u00e1j\u00e1, seems to have retained the office of Wazir throughout the previous reign, and he was re-appointed by Udai Singh. Much of the prosperity which the State enjoyed seems to have been due to his able administration, and it continued while he lived. He died, however, shortly after Udai Singh's accession. About the same time R\u00e1j Singh of Guler also died, and was succeeded by his son Dhulip Singh, a minor, to whom Udai Singh had been appointed guardian. Taking advantage of Dhulip Singh's minority, the R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Jammu, Badhu, and Basohli, invaded Guler, and Udai Singh was appealed to for help. He sent to Siba, Kahlur and Mandi, and with the co-operation of these States drove out the invaders, and restored the infant R\u00e1j\u00e1 to his rights.\n\nSo far all had gone well, and how long this prosperity continued we do not know, but dark days were now at hand. Udai Singh was of a self-willed disposition, and, after his uncle's guiding hand and wise counsel were withdrawn, his natural tendencies began to assert themselves. He gradually gave way to evil courses, and surrendered himself to sensual pleasures, which alienated from him the loyalty of his people. The administration of the State became more and more disorganised, and at length a climax was reached when Udai Singh appointed a barber, with whose daughter he had fallen in love, to the office of Wazir, and resigned all authority into his hands. The officials then interfered and deposed him from power, in the hope that this would have a salutary effect. Meantime Uggar Singh, son of Mahipat Singh, and cousin of the R\u00e1j\u00e1, was appointed regent. At the end of a month Udai Singh was restored, but he soon relapsed into his former ways; and Uggar Singh, being afraid, fled to Jammu. Things went from bad to worse until, at last, the officials formed a conspiracy against the R\u00e1j\u00e1, and determined to kill him, and put Lachman Singh, his younger brother, on the gaddi. Lachman Singh, on being approached, fell in with their designs, and joined the conspirator. To carry out their purpose, a day was fixed when Udai Singh was to hunt at Udaipur, a large plain on the left bank of the R\u00e1vi, three miles below Chamb\u00e1. About mid-day they began firing their guns, and Udai Singh, realising danger, came out of his tent with a sword in his hand. Seeing a few of his personal servants standing near, he called on them to rally around him. Touched by this appeal, and repenting of the part he was playing, Lachman Singh abandoned the conspirators, and took his stand beside his brother. On this the officials ordered Lachman Singh to be killed first, and then the R\u00e1j\u00e1 was mortally wounded. He died in a few days. The spot on which this tragedy took place has remained uncultivated to the present time.\nUdai Singh died in A.D. 1720, after having reigned for thirty years. He left no heir to succeed him, and Lachman Singh seems also to have died childless.\n\n**Uggar Singh\u2014(A.D. 1720).**\u2014As has been stated, Uggar Singh acted as regent for a time during his cousin's suspension from power, but on Udai Singh's restoration he took refuge in Jammu. There he entered the service of Dharab Deo, R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Jammu, as a soldier, without disclosing his identity. One day as he was returning from bathing in the river Tawi, with a lota full of water in his hand, he was met by a mast elephant which had broken loose, and which, seeing Uggar Singh, suddenly charged down upon him. He checked the animal for a moment by a blow with the lota, and thus gained time to draw his sword, with which he severed the trunk from the body at one blow. The feat was reported to the R\u00e1j\u00e1, who summoned Uggar Singh to his presence, and elicited from him the fact of his near relationship to the ruling family of Chamb\u00e1. He seems in fact to have been next in the succession after the two sons of Chatar Singh, his uncles Jai Singh and Indar Singh having probably died childless.\n\nShortly afterwards intelligence of the assassination of Udai Singh and his brother arrived, and Dharab Deo then furnished Uggar Singh with all necessary assistance, and sent him back to Chamb\u00e1 where he was installed as R\u00e1j\u00e1.\n\nIt is said that the ghost of the murdered R\u00e1j\u00e1 used to appear to Uggar Singh, and cause him much distress, and that to lay the evil spirit he erected a temple at Udaipur, near the place of the murder, and imposed a small tax for its maintenance. The temple is still in existence and the tax, called Tirsera Udai Singhi\u00e1na Autari\u00e1na is still collected.\n\nShortly after his accession, Uggar Singh had his suspicions aroused against his cousin Dalel Singh, son of Raghum\u00e1th Singh, who was then a boy, residing with his maternal uncle in Jammu territory; and the Mughal Viceroy on being appealed to, had Dalel Singh brought to Lahore and kept in confinement.\n\nUggar Singh was popular at first, but as years went on the feelings of the officials towards him underwent a change, and they decided to depose him and raise Dalel Singh to the gaddi. Their first step was to gain over the Viceroy by a present of a lakh of rupees, whereby Dalel Singh's release was secured, also a sanad appointing him R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Chamb\u00e1. This appointment was supported by a force of Mughal troops. On hearing of Dalel Singh's approach, Uggar Singh made no effort to oppose him, but broke down the bridge over the R\u00e1vi, and set fire to the town. He then retired to the Ch\u00e1mund\u00e1 Temple, whence he watched the conflagration, and thereafter fled up the R\u00e1vi Valley. When passing the village of Juh in Chanota, he was wounded in the thigh by a bullet fired by the R\u00e1n\u00e1 of Gurola, and the spot where this happened has been marked by a small shrine ever since. Uggar Singh then fled to K\u00e1ngra, where he\nsoon afterwards died. He left two sons, Ummed Singh and Sher Singh, who were then quite young.\n\nDalel Singh\u2014(A.D. 1735).\u2014Having secured the gaddi, the new R\u00e1j\u00e1's first care was to have Uggar Singh's sons placed under lock and key in Lahore, where they remained for thirteen years. Dalel Singh also rewarded those who had helped him to obtain the kingdom, and made himself popular by remitting various oppressive taxes.\n\nNevertheless the sons of Uggar Singh, as the rightful heirs to the throne, had many friends and supporters among the people, who only waited for a suitable opportunity to restore them. In spite of every effort, however, it was found impossible for some time to effect their release, but at length this was secured through a servant of Ummed Singh, belonging to the Katw\u00e1lu family in Chamb\u00e1. This young man was of the same age as his master, and strongly resembled him in appearance; and, the two having exchanged clothes, Ummed Singh escaped, the servant remaining in his place. When the deception was discovered the man was brought before the Mughal Viceroy, who asked him why he had thus forfeited his life. For answer he said that he had only done his duty to his master, and was ready to bear the penalty. The Viceroy was so pleased with this reply, and with the man's fidelity and devotion, that he ordered his release, and dismissed him with presents. But Ummed Singh did not succeed in escaping after all, for he was re-captured, and brought back to Lahore. On enquiry, however, the Viceroy became acquainted with the fact that he was the rightful heir to the Chamb\u00e1 gaddi, and a sanad was therefore granted, along with an armed force, to enable him to recover his territory. Being married to a daughter of the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Jasrot\u00e1, Ummed Singh came by way of Jasrot\u00e1 and Basohli, obtaining further assistance from these Chiefs. Dalel Singh was urged by his officials to prepare for resistance, but he refused to do so, saying that Ummed Singh was the lawful heir, and he would not oppose his claim. He accordingly remained at the capital, and on Ummed Singh's arrival surrendered the State into his hands, and was kindly dealt with. For a time he continued to reside in Chamb\u00e1, but afterwards became a s\u00e1dhu, and died at Jaw\u00e1la Mukhi. He left no son, and his daughter was married to Bajai Deo of Jammu.\n\nUmmed Singh\u2014(A.D. 1748).\u2014This R\u00e1j\u00e1 was a just ruler and an able administrator. He succeeded to the State at a very momentous period in Indian history. The Mughal Empire was now in the throes of dissolution; the Viceroys of the provinces were assuming independence, and the Mar\u00e1thas and Afgh\u00e1ns had begun their life-and-death struggle for the mastery of India. All paramount authority was thus at an end, and the Hill Chiefs, taking advantage of the anarchy which prevailed, threw off their allegiance, and recovered all the territory of which they had been deprived by the Mughals. A large and fertile district of the Chamb\u00e1 State, to the south of the Dhaula Dh\u00e1r, had been thus confiscated;\nUmmed Singh re-asserted his sway over it, and carried his victorious arms along the southern slopes of the range as far as the borders of Mandi. His troops garrisoned the fort of Pathiar near Palampur, and he is said to have obtained a footing in Bir Bangahal. In the Kangra Settlement Report, Mr. Barnes refers to a letter from the Emperor Ahmad Shah to the Chamba Chief, remonstrating with him on the seizure of Chari and Rihlu. So low had the Empire fallen. As Ahmad Shah reigned from A.D. 1748 to 1755, it must have been within these years that the State territory to the south of the Dhaua Dhar was restored to its ancient limits. It probably took place previous to A.D. 1752, for in that year Mughal supremacy entirely ceased with the cession of the Hill States, along with the rest of the Punjab, to Ahmad Shah Durrani. But Afghan rule was never more than nominal in the Hills to the east of the Jhelum, and Chamba seems to have enjoyed practical independence till about A.D. 1767, when it came more or less under the influence of the Sikhs. The State, however, lost the jagir in Jaswan which it had held from the time of Prithvi Singh, owing to the refusal of Ummed Singh to attend the Imperial Darbar at Lahore.\n\nThe Kandchandi portion of the palace, which is still in existence, was erected by Ummed Singh, and he also built a palace at Nada, eight miles down the Ravi Valley, changing the name of the place to Rajnagar. There his son Raj Singh was born in A.D. 1755. Only one gateway of this building now remains.\n\nUmmed Singh died on the 13th of Baisakh Vik. 1820=A.D. 1764, in the 39th year of his age, and the 16th of his reign. He left orders that no rani was to become sati at his funeral.\n\nRaj Singh\u2014(A.D. 1764).\u2014He was only nine years old at the time of his father's death, and Ummed Singh, being suspicious of the designs of his younger brother, Sher Singh, had left secret orders that, immediately on his own decease, Sher Singh should be arrested and kept under restraint. This was done, and all danger was thus averted.\n\nSoon after this, Ghamand Chand of Kangra, taking advantage of Raj Singh's minority, seized the fort of Pathiar, and drove the Chamba troops out of Bir Bangahal, but the queen-regent, who was a Jammu princess, obtained help from Ranjit Deo of that State, and recovered the territory which had been lost. It would appear, however, that another and more successful attempt was made by the Kangra Chief, for all the State territory to the east of Rihlu was lost to Chamba prior to the death of Raj Singh.\n\nRanjit Deo of Jammu seems to have interfered a great deal in Chamba affairs during the minority of Raj Singh, owing to his near relationship to the Rajas mother. He probably aimed\n\n---\n\n(1) For a short time in 1758 all the Hill States, and even the Mughal Governor of Kangra, were subject to Adina Beg, Viceroy of the Punjab under the Marathas.\n\n(2) The foundations of the Bang Mahal at Chamba are also said to have been laid by this Rajas.\nat bringing the State entirely under his own supremacy. On the decline of Mughal rule, Ranjit Deo had also become practically independent, and, not content with his own ancestral possessions, had asserted his sway over all the Hill States between the Chenab and the Ravi. As has been stated, his influence was felt as far east as Chamb\u00e1 where he had appointed one of his own officials, named Aklu, to the office of Wazir. While the queen-mother lived things remained quiet but she died soon after Raj Singh came of age, and, her influence being withdrawn, the young prince who disliked Aklu, and probably suspected secret designs against the State, had him seized and thrown into prison. This was resented as a personal insult by Ranjit Deo, who sent an army under Amrit Pal of Basohli to invade Chamb\u00e1. Raj Singh was absent at the time, having gone to interview the Viceroy of the Panj\u00e1b at Kal\u00e1naur. He heard of the invasion at N\u00farpur on his way back, and at once sent to the R\u00e1mgarhia Sard\u00e1rs to ask assistance, for which he paid a lakh of rupees. With their help he drove out the Jammu army after it had been in possession of his capital for three months. This took place in A.D. 1775, and is the first reference to the Sikhs in the State annals.\n\nThe Durr\u00e1n\u00ed rule, which had always been intermittent, came to an end in the Central and Eastern Punjab after the last invasion of Ahmad Shah in A.D. 1767. The Sikhs then rapidly acquired political power, and their marauding bands roamed about the country, intent only on plunder and rapine. They had by this time formed themselves into the twelve misls, or confederacies which preceded their consolidation into one kingdom under Ranjit Singh. One of these was the R\u00e1mgarhia misl, and Jassa Singh, the head of this confederacy, seems to have been the first Sikh leader to invade the Kangra Hills. About A.D. 1770 he made tributary to himself Ghamand Chand of Kangra, and several other Hill States, one of which was probably Chamb\u00e1. This is, in all likelihood, the reason why Raj Singh went to him for help against Jammu. His authority was, however, of brief duration, for in A.D. 1776 he was defeated on the plains by Jit Singh, of the Kanhiya misl, who then assumed the suzerainty of most of the Kangra group of States. In the Kangra Settlement Report, Mr. Barnes refers to a document in his name fixing the amount of tribute payable by Chamb\u00e1 at 4,001 rupees. This document is dated A.D. 1776.\n\nRaj Singh was married to a daughter of Sampat Pal of Bhadraw\u00e1h, and his son Jit Singh was born in A.D. 1775.\n\nIn A.D. 1782 Raj Singh invaded and conquered Basohli, but restored the country on payment of a lakh of rupees, the amount he had paid for the assistance of the Sikhs against Basohli and\n\n---\n\n(1) There is a copper-plate in existence granted by Amrit Pal on this occasion in place of one which had been lost. It is dated Vik. 1831\u2014A.D. 1775.\n(2) Probably Khwaja Obed, the Afghan Viceroy.\nJammu, Bhadraw\u00e1h was at this time tributary to Chamb\u00e1, as it probably had been for a considerable period. It was, however, under its own native ruler, whose name was Daya P\u00e1l.\n\nIn A.D. 1786 Chamb\u00e1 also asserted its supremacy over the Native State of Kashtw\u00e1r on, it is said, the invitation of Brij R\u00e1j Deo of Jammu; and an army under Jit Singh, son of R\u00e1j Singh, then only eleven years old, was sent to invade the territory. In this it was successful, and Kashtw\u00e1r was conquered and held for six months, during which the Chamb\u00e1 troops remained in the capital. They seem to have been withdrawn on the approach of winter, and the return of the Kashtw\u00e1r Chief from Kashmir, whither he had fled, with an army provided by the Durr\u00e1n\u00ed rulers, who then held the valley.\n\nMeanwhile events fraught with disastrous consequences to the Chamb\u00e1 Chief were ripening in Kangra. On the decline of the Mughal Empire, Ghamand Chand of Kangra resumed possession of that portion of the Kangra Valley which had been included in the Imperial demesne in the time of Akbar, and also made strenuous efforts to capture the Kangra Fort; in which, however, he was unsuccessful. This famous stronghold was held by Naw\u00e1b Saif-ull\u00e1h Kh\u00e1n, the last of the Mughal Governors of the Kangra Hills, who, we are told, continued to correspond directly with Delhi. Though completely isolated, and possessing nothing but the lands immediately beneath the walls, this brave officer contrived to hold his own against all assailants for more than thirty years. In A.D. 1774 Sans\u00e1r Chand, grandson of Ghama\u1e47d Chand, succeeded to the kingdom of Kangra. About the same time the Mughal Governor, who had held the fort so long, was removed by death; and the Kangra Chief then redoubled his efforts to regain possession of the ancient capital of his kingdom. Being still unsuccessful, he called in to his help Jai Singh Kanhiya, the Sikh Chieftain already referred to, and a force was sent under his son Gurbakhsh Singh. By stratagem the garrison was persuaded to capitulate, but, much to Sans\u00e1r Chand's chagrin and disappointment, the capitulation was made to the Sikhs and not to himself. One account states that the siege took place in A.D. 1781, and that the old Naw\u00e1b was then still alive, but dangerously ill; and on his demise the fort was surrendered by his son. However this may be, Jai Singh got possession of the stronghold and retained it till A.D. 1785-86; when, being defeated on the plains by a combination against him aided by Sans\u00e1r Chand, he withdrew from the hills, leaving Kangra Fort in the hands of its legitimate Chief, to whom it was thus restored about two centuries after its occupation by the Mughals.\n\nWith the recovery of the fort, and the withdrawal of the Sikhs from the hills, Sans\u00e1r Chand was left at liberty to prosecute his ambitions designs. He revived the ancient claim of Kangra to the\n\n(1) This is the correct spelling of the Badraw\u00e1r of the maps.\n(2) Kangra Fort was in former times regarded as impregnable, and the popular conception of the prestige attaching to its possession found expression in the saying:\u2014\n\"He who holds the Fort, holds the Hills.\"\n(Ps. Kangra Settlement Report, page 10.)\nheadship of the eleven states of the Jalandhar group, which had been in abeyance in the Mughal times, and arrogated to himself supreme authority over the Chiefs. He compelled them to pay tribute, encroached upon their territories, and seized by force all the lands which had been included in the imperial demesne. In pursuance of this claim he demanded of R\u00e1j Singh the surrender of the Rihlu v\u0101q\u0101, as having been part of the Kangra k\u0101rd\u0101r\u012b under the Mughals. This demand was met by a prompt refusal, and, seeing a collision inevitable, R\u00e1j Singh began at once to prepare for war. He went in person to Rihlu, and built or repaired and strengthened the fort, which was garrisoned by his own troops.\n\nMeantime Sansar Chand was not slow to support his demand by armed force. He concluded a treaty with Dhian Singh, Wazir of Guler, who, in those unsettled times, had seized the small State of Ketila, between Kangra and Nurpur, and had made himself independent. R\u00e1j Singh obtained help from Nurpur. The Chamb\u0101 army was disposed in various directions along the frontiers, keeping watch and ward, while R\u00e1j Singh himself was at Nerti near Shahpur, with the Nurpur levies and a small force of his own troops. Sansar Chand, getting intelligence of this, advanced secretly, and fell suddenly upon the Chamb\u0101 force, which was taken completely by surprise. The Nurpur levies fell into a panic and fled, leaving with the R\u00e1ja only forty-five of his own men. His officers urged him to make a retreat, pointing out to him the hopelessness of effecting a stand against such superior numbers, but he refused to do so, saying it would be a disgrace to retire when confronted by the enemy. His personal attendants and servants first fell around him, and then the R\u00e1ja himself was wounded in the thigh by a bullet. Still he bravely fought on, killing many of his opponents and performing prodigies of valour. At last a man named Jit Singh, Purbea, came from behind, and struck him on the head with a sword. R\u00e1j Singh wiped away the blood, and then, resting his hand on a large stone near which he was standing, fell dead. The impress of the blood-stained hand is believed to be still visible on the stone. A temple was erected on the spot by his son at which a mela is held every year on the anniversary of his death. R\u00e1j Singh's bravery on this occasion is still commemorated in song by the local bards throughout these mountains. He is said to have paid special veneration to Chamunda Devi, the Goddess of War of the Chamb\u0101 Chiefs, and was promised by her an addition of twelve years to his life, and the honour of dying in battle as he desired.\n\nR\u00e1j Singh died on the 7th of Har Vik, 1850 = A.D. 1794; in the 40th year of his age, and the 30th of his reign. When his body was examined it was found to bear no fewer than eighteen wounds.\n\n(1) This man's name is given differently in different accounts of the battle. In one it is Amar Singh, Hazari, and he is said to have been one of four brothers present, one of whom was killed by R\u00e1j Singh.\n\n(2) R\u00e1j Singh repaired or rebuilt the Chamunda Temple, and the steps leading up to it were also made by him.\n\n(3) R\u00e1j Singh's body was cremated at Rihlu Fort, and his r\u0101nis became sati in Chamb\u0101.\nCHAP. I. B.\n\nJit Singh\u2014(A.D. 1794).\u2014Notwithstanding the death of the R\u00e1j\u00e1 the Chamb\u00fa troops continued to maintain their hold on Rihlu, and there was no more fighting. Sans\u00e1r Chand secured only a few villages on the border. Jit Singh was nineteen years of age at the time of his father's death; and shortly after his accession he was involved in a war with Basohli. Bajai P\u00e1l, of that State was in the habit of making inroads into the Jund and Bh\u00e1lai il\u00e1q\u00e1s of Chamb\u00fa, which adjoined his own territory, and of plundering the country. In A.D. 1800 Jit Singh retaliated by invading Basohli, and after conquering the State, restored it, as his father had done, on payment of a war indemnity. Some time after this the Chamb\u00fa Chief was desirous of visiting the shrine of Devi Mal in Balor, but the R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Basohli, Badhu and R\u00e1m\u00ednagar, suspecting that he had designs against them, sent a nazar\u00e1na of Rs. 50,000, with a request to him to turn back, which he accordingly did.\n\nMeanwhile Sans\u00e1r Chand had been engaged in still further consolidating and extending his power; and, with the acquisition of Fort Kangra, he was able to exercise a tyrannical and oppressive sway over all the Hill States between the R\u00e1vi and the Satl\u00e9j. These he made entirely subject, and compelled the Chiefs to attend his Court, and send contingents for his military expeditions. In this way he fully established his power in the hills, and ruled despotically for twenty years, gaining for himself a renown which had never been approached by any of his ancestors; and his name is still widely known throughout these mountains. But his overweening ambition carried him too far. Not content with what he had acquired in the hills, he aimed also at the recovery of his ancestral possessions on the plains, which had been lost after the invasions of Mahm\u00fad of Ghazni; and is said even to have dreamt of a Katoch kingdom in the Panj\u00e1b. For this purpose he twice descended from the mountains into the B\u00e1r\u00ed Do\u00e1b, but was driven back by Ranjit Singh, who was then rising into power, and would brook no rival. This was in A.D. 1803 and 1804. Disappointed in his designs on the plains, Sans\u00e1r Chand in A.D. 1805, turned his arms against the State of Bil\u00e1spur, and seized part of the territory lying on the right bank of the Satl\u00e9j. This was the last straw; and the Hill Chiefs, smarting under the many indignities heaped upon them, and fearing probably for their own possessions, formed a general confederacy against him, the ultimate result of which was his downfall, and the complete extinction of his kingdom.\n\nPrevious to A.D. 1803 the Gurkh\u00e1s of Nep\u00e1l had invaded and annexed the mountain area between the Gogra and the Satl\u00e9j, and Bil\u00e1spur was subject to them. The R\u00e1j\u00e1 of that State, in conjunction with all the associated States of the Jal\u00e1ndhar Circle, and also Basohli, sent to invite Amar Singh Thapa,\n\n---\n\n1) Sans\u00e1r Chand is said to have given orders that R\u00e1j Singh should be taken prisoner and the R\u00e1j\u00e1's death caused him much concern. This may partly account for the sudden cessation of hostilities; a copper-plate exists recording a treaty of amity and friendship between R\u00e1j Singh and Sans\u00e1r Chand, dated Vik. 1845 = A.D. 1788.\n\n2) Vide Kangra Settlement Report, page 10.\nthe Gurkha Commander, to invade Kangra, and promised him their support. This invitation was eagerly accepted, and the Gurkha army at once crossed the Sutlej, and was met by contingents from the Confederate States. This was in the spring of A.D. 1806. Nathu, the Wazir of Chamba, was sent in charge of the State troops. The Kangra forces, which had been weakened by recent changes, made a brave but ineffectual resistance, and the Gurkhas then advanced into the heart of the country and laid siege to Kangra Fort, in which Sansar Chand had taken refuge. The fort was invested for four years, but all the efforts of the Gurkhas were unequal to the task of reducing it. At length, rendered desperate by the misery and distress which had come upon his country, and seeing no hope of relief, Sansar Chand, in A.D. 1809, sent Fateh Chand, his younger brother, to ask the aid of Ranjit Singh. This request was readily granted, but on condition that the Kangra Fort should be surrendered; and to this Sansar Chand had to agree. The Maharaja then advanced into the hills in person, in May, A.D. 1809, and being met by Sansar Chand, who had escaped from the fort in disguise, he in August gave battle to the Gurkhas, defeated them, and compelled them to retire across the Sutlej. According to agreement Ranjit Singh then took possession of the fort, and with it the 66 villages in the Kangra Valley which had formed a part of the Imperial demesne, leaving the rest of the Kangra State in the hands of Sansar Chand, who was now reduced to the position of a feudatory of the Sikhs. His downfall involved that of the other States, and from A.D. 1809 all of them, including Chamba, became tributary to Lahore.\n\nJit Singh died in A.D. 1808, while the siege of the Kangra Fort was still going on, in the 33rd year of his age, and the 14th of his reign. He lived in troublous times, and a large army had to be maintained for the defence of the State, but he managed his affairs with such prudence that the revenues sufficed for all expenses, and the State was never in debt. His sons were Charat Singh and Zorawar Singh.\n\nCharat Singh\u2014(A.D. 1808).\u2014He was only six years old at the time of his father's death, but the State officials seated him on the gaddi, and installed him as Rajah. During Charat Singh's minority the administration was in the hands of the queen-mother, a Jammu princess, and of Nathu, a member of the Baratru family, who had been appointed Wazir in the reign of Jit Singh. The queen-mother, whose name was Rani Sarda, was a wise and far-seeing woman. She erected the temple of Radha Krishna, which was consecrated on the 14th of Baisakh, Vik. 1882 = A.D. 1825. It was she, too, who caused the steps to be made to the Rani's shrine alongside the water-course on the Shah Madar Hill. Nathu, Wazir, also seems to have been a man of great ability and administrative talent. His name is still remembered in Chamba,\n\n(1) Sansar Chand died in Dec. 1823, and in 1827-8 his kingdom was annexed by Ranjit Singh.\nwhere he is spoken of with great respect. The first event of importance after the accession of the young Chief was a threatened invasion of the Sikhs under Ranjit Singh. He had reduced Jasrot\u00e1 and Basohli, in the Jammu Hills, to the position of tributaries, and was advancing on Chamb\u00e1, when he was bought off by large presents. This was in A.D. 1808-09. The State soon afterwards became subject to Lahore but remained almost completely free from actual invasion, though threatened with it more than once. This immunity was due in part to the mountainous and difficult character of the country, but also in a considerable degree to the personal influence, and great sagacity, of Nath\u00fa, the Waz\u00edr, who was a favourite with the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja.\n\nAs already mentioned, the small State of Bhadraw\u00e1h had long been tributary to Chamb\u00e1, and was ruled by its own Chief whose name at this time was Daya P\u00e1l.(1) Towards the end of his reign internal family quarrels arose in Bhadraw\u00e1h, and Daya P\u00e1l was driven out, and died in Dinanagar. Pah\u00e1r Chand, his cousin, succeeded, in the absence of a direct heir, and after some years he, in A.D. 1820, refused to continue the payment of tribute to Chamb\u00e1. Nath\u00fa, Waz\u00edr, advanced against him, but was defeated on the Padari Pass. He then went to Ranjit Singh, and, obtaining help from him with a sanad of transfer, advanced a second time in A.D. 1821. The R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Bhadraw\u00e1h finding resistance hopeless, partly demolished a fort recently erected, and fled, never to return. Bhadraw\u00e1h was then annexed to the Chamb\u00e1 State, and placed under the direct control of its officials.\n\nIn A.D. 1821, Desa Singh, Maj\u00edthia,(2) in the name of Ranjit Singh, claimed Rihlu as having been a part of the K\u00e1ngra k\u00e1rd\u00e1v\u00ed under the Empire, and laid siege to the fort. Nath\u00fa sent orders to the officer in command to hold out till he should proceed to Lahore, and arrange the matter with the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja; but the queen-mother, becoming afraid of the consequences of further resistance, directed the fort to be surrendered to the Sikhs. Rihlu thus passed away finally from the possession of the State. Nath\u00fa went to Lahore, but failed in his mission, in so far as the retention of Rihlu was concerned, but he succeeded in persuading Ranjit Singh to give back R\u00e1nitar, a small place in Rihlu, which had been the hereditary y\u00e1jg\u00edr of the R\u00e1m\u00eds of the Chamb\u00e1 family. He also secured the remission of the yearly tribute of Rs. 30,000, in consideration of the loss of Rihlu. Mr. Vigne states that Chamb\u00e1 agreed to the surrender of Rihlu on condition of being allowed to retain Bhadraw\u00e1h, and the fact of a sanad having been granted by Ranjit Singh, in A.D. 1820, conveying Bhadraw\u00e1h to Chamb\u00e1 seems to lend support to this version. This sanad, as we shall see, helped\n\n(1) Fateh P\u00e1l and Bhup Chand, the fathers, respectively, of Daya P\u00e1l and Pah\u00e1r Chand, were prisoners in the Pakki Chaunk or old palace at Chamb\u00e1 and died there. Pah\u00e1r Chand's mother was a Chamb\u00e1 princess.\n\n(2) Desa Singh was the first Sikh n\u00e1s\u00edm or Governor of K\u00e1ngra. The Rihlu Fort was surrendered on 2nd D\u00e1r, S. 97= A.D. 1821.\nto save the State from dismemberment and practical annexation to Jammu.\n\nIn A.D. 1815 Bir Singh of Nurpur, brother-in-law of Charat Singh, was expelled from his principality by Ranjit Singh, and fled to Chamb\u00e1. There he raised an army to attempt the recovery of his State, and, being defeated, sought refuge in British territory across the Satlej. In A.D. 1826 he returned to Nurpur in disguise, and his people rallied around him, but on the approach of a Sikh force he again retired to Chamb\u00e1; and having been given up under compulsion by Charat Singh, he was imprisoned for seven years in the fort of Govindgarh. Thereafter he was ransomed by the Chamb\u00e1 Chief for Rs. 85,000 and returned to Chamb\u00e1, where he resided off and on for some time. He was in Chamb\u00e1 at the time of Mr. Vigne's visit in 1839, and, finally, died at Nurpur in 1846, while engaged in a last vain attempt to recover his principality.\n\nIn A.D. 1820-25 Ratanu, the P\u00e1lasra, or Chief State Official in P\u00e1dar, invaded Z\u00e1nskar, and made it tributary to Chamb\u00e1. It had till then been under its own Raj\u00e1, who was subject to Lad\u00e1kh.\n\nIn A.D. 1835 Gul\u00e1b Singh of Jammu sent an army under Waz\u00edr Zor\u00e1war Singh, Kahluria, one of his ablest generals, to invade and conquer Lad\u00e1kh. After the conquest a force under Waz\u00edr Lakhat Rai was detached from the main army to annex Z\u00e1nskar, which still held out, and having done this the force crossed the Um\u00e1si Pass and passed through P\u00e1dar on the way back to Jammu. It is believed that Gul\u00e1b Singh had no intention of encroaching on State territory, but the P\u00e1dar people were suspicious, and some opposition was offered to the passage of the Dogra army. This, however, did not amount to much, and the main body passed on leaving only about thirty men in Chatargarh to keep up communications. Thereupon Ratanu, the Chamb\u00e1 official, stirred up the people, seized the Dogra soldiers, and sent them to Chamb\u00e1. Charat Singh at once disowned the act of his official, but the mischief had been done, and in the spring of 1836 Zor\u00e1war Singh came in person with a large force to avenge the insult. Ratanu had the bridge over the Chandra-Bh\u00e1g\u00e1 broken down, and in this way kept the Dogras at bay for three months, but at last having, with the help of some villagers, passed a jhula across the river a few miles lower down, Zor\u00e1war Singh succeeded in transferring a portion of his force to the other bank, and thus, advancing under cover of night, effected an entrance into Chatargarh by the bridge over the Bhutna N\u00e1l\u00e1, which had been left intact. Chatargarh was razed to the ground, and the name of the place changed to Gul\u00e1bgarh; and several of the P\u00e1dar people were hanged or mutilated. The country was then annexed to Jammu.\n\nIt was in P\u00e1dar that a sapphire mine was discovered in 1880 which has been a source of considerable gain to the Jammu State.\n\n---\n\n(1) The tribute is said to have been Rs. 1,000 yearly, besides musk bags and other things.\n(2) Twenty men with a thanadar had been left at Padam in Z\u00e1nskar, but they were all killed in an outbreak; and it was probably on hearing this that Ratan attacked the small force in Chatargarh.\n(3) The right bank of the Ganaur N\u00e1l\u00e1 in P\u00e1ngi was seized at the same time, and included in P\u00e1dar.\nRatanu, whose excess of loyalty had caused all the trouble, fled to Chamb\u00e1, but he was seized and sent to Jammu, where he was confined for some years. He was then released and allotted a small jagir in Kashtw\u00e1r, which is still held by his family, who, however, have now been permitted to return to their original home in P\u00e1dar. It is told of him that, on learning of Charat Singh's death, he shaved his head and beard as a sign of mourning, and on hearing of this, Gul\u00e1b Singh sent for him. In reply to the R\u00e1j\u00e1's inquiry, Ratanu is reported to have answered that Charat Singh of Chamb\u00e1 was his master, and that he was bound to go into mourning on such an occasion. Gul\u00e1b Singh was so pleased with his boldness and patriotic feeling that he was at once forgiven.\n\nIn 1836 a Dogra army, under Zor\u00e1war Singh, Kahlurin, advanced against Bhadraw\u00e1h, but the fort was strongly held by the Chamb\u00e1 troops, while another force was advancing from Chamb\u00e1 to their support, and the Dogras had therefore to retire.\n\nWazir Nath\u00fa died about 1838, and his death was a great loss to the State, which he had served so faithfully for more than 40 years. He is said to have stood high in the favour of Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 Ranjit Singh, on account of important personal service rendered on the occasion of the first invasion of Kashmir in 1814, which ended disastrously for the Sikhs. This personal influence with the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 stood the State in good stead at several grave junctures.\n\nHe was succeeded by Wazir Bh\u00e1ga, also a member of the Baratru family. It was soon after this, in February 1839, that Chamb\u00e1 was for the first time visited by a European in the person of Mr. Vigne. He came by Basohli and Sandh\u00e1ra and departed by Chu\u00e1ri and N\u00e1rp\u00far. He speaks of Charat Singh as \"not tall, inclined to corpulency,\" with a full face, light complexion, good profile and a large eye, a somewhat heavy expression and a weak voice.\" Of Zor\u00e1war Singh he remarks that \"he is not so corpulent as his brother, with very handsome, but inexpressive features, and is always splendidly dressed \u00e0 la Sikh with a ch\u00e9lenk of rubies and emeralds worn on the forehead over the turban.\" The R\u00e1j\u00e1's travels, he states, had never extended beyond Chenini, whither he went to claim and carry off his bride, a daughter of the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of that place. As regards the daily routine, Mr. Vigne says: \"The R\u00e1j\u00e1 passes his time very monotonously, devoting a great part of every morning to his puja; then follows the breakfast and the long siesta. He then gives a short attention to business, and afterwards he and his brother ride up and down the 'green' on an elephant, between two others, in the centre of a line of a dozen well-mounted horsemen.\"\n\nZor\u00e1war Singh, the R\u00e1j\u00e1's younger brother, is still remembered in Chamb\u00e1, and the people love to dwell upon the cordiality and affection which existed between the two brothers. Charat Singh never went to Lahore himself, but always sent Zor\u00e1war Singh\n\n(1) Travels in Kashmir, Vol. I, pages 150-52.\ninstead, and in 1833 he was raised to the dignity of R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Bhadraw\u00e1h and was then spoken of as \"Chota R\u00e1j\u00e1.\" Possibly this title had some association with the ancient designation of \"Yuv\u00e1raja,\" and, till the birth of Sri Singh in 1839, Zor\u00e1war Singh must have been regarded as heir-apparent to the gaddi. This probably was at the bottom of the trouble which, as we shall see, arose after Charat Singh's death.\n\nMr. Vigne met Bir Singh of N\u00farpur at Chamb\u00e9, and heard the story of his misfortunes from his own lips. Bir Singh's anxiety to regain his dominions was evident in every sentence he uttered. In the same year, 1839, Chamb\u00e9 was visited by General Cunningham, who was the first to examine the archaeological remains in the State, both at the capital and Brahmuir.\n\nCharat Singh was afflicted with a form of melancholia which cast a cloud over the last two or three years of his life. He died in 1844 in the 42nd year of his age, having occupied the gaddi for 36 years. Two r\u00e1nis and six concubines became sati, this being the last occasion of such a rite in Chamb\u00e9. He left three sons, Sri Singh, Gop\u00e1l Singh and Sushet Singh, all of whom were mere children at the time of their father's death.\n\nSri Singh\u2014(A.D. 1844).\u2014He was only five years of age on his accession, and all authority remained in the hands of his mother, who was a Katoch princess, while Bh\u00e1ga continued to hold the office of W\u00e1z\u00edr. Some suspicion had been aroused in regard to Zor\u00e1war Singh, the young R\u00e1j\u00e1's uncle, and the queen-mother tried to have him arrested and imprisoned, but he easily escaped, and there was a disturbance in the capital. Zor\u00e1war Singh, however, seems to have been unable to gain any support among the people, and immediately fled to Bhadraw\u00e1h, of which he was titular R\u00e1j\u00e1. Thence he went to Jammu, and died there soon afterwards, in 1845. His son, Pr\u00e1kim Singh, was then made R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Bhadraw\u00e1h, but that State was annexed in the same year by Gul\u00e1b Singh of Jammu.\n\nSoon after Sri Singh was seated on the gaddi an incident occurred which, in less fortunate circumstances, might have ended disastrously for the State. The facts of the case are thus related. There was in State service a Brahman, of Basohli, named N\u00e1rs\u00edn Sh\u00e1h, who, having been originally a timber contractor, went by the name of Lakar Sh\u00e1h. He was a relative of Pandit Jalla, who with Hira Singh, son of Dhian Singh of Jammu, at that time wielded supreme power in Lahore. This man seems to have acted as agent of the Sikh Government, and managed to acquire so much influence in Chamb\u00e9 that the whole State administration was virtually in his hands. In his time, and by his orders, a new issue of the Chamb\u00e9 copper coin was made, and is still called Lakar Sh\u00e1hi, after him. The State officials resented his arrogance,\n\n(1) It is probable that Bhadraw\u00e1h had come more or less under the control of Jammu some time previous to this.\nand took counsel with the R\u00e1ni to have him put out of the way. Accordingly he was set upon one day, seized, bound and carried up the S\u00e1ho Valley, and over to Bailj, where he was killed. Bh\u00e1g\u00e1, Waz\u00edr, and two of the State officials then went to Lahore to try to pacify Hira Singh and avert the consequences of their act; but Pandit Jalla had them cast into prison, and sent an army to invade Chamb\u00e1. One division came by Ch\u00fan and Sandh\u00e1ra, and on its approach the R\u00e1ni took Sri Singh and fled up the R\u00e1v\u00ed Valley to Basn. The capital was captured and looted by the Sikhs. Another Sikh force advanced by N\u00farpur, but the Chamb\u00e1 troops in T\u00e1rigarh Fort kept them at bay, and prevented their coming farther than J\u00e1jari. The Ganeshgarh Fort was taken by a Sikh force from Kotila. Things were looking very dark for the State when news arrived of the assassination of Hira Singh and Pandit Jalla by the soldiery in Lahore, on the 21st December, A.D. 1844; whereupon the invading armies at once withdrew. Waz\u00edr Bh\u00e1g\u00e1 and his companions were also set at liberty, and returned to Chamb\u00e1.\n\nThe disorders in the Punjab, which followed the death of Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 Ranjit Singh, were now fast approaching a crisis, and the following year, 1845, broke out the First Sikh War, which ended so disastrously for the Sikh Kingdom. On its conclusion the treaty of peace, as finally arranged, included the transfer to the British Government in perpetual sovereignty of the Jalandhar Do\u00e1b and the hill country between the Bi\u00e1s and the Satlej. A war indemnity of a crore-and-a-half of rupees was also stipulated for. The Sikh Darb\u00e1r, being unable to meet this demand, agreed to cede the hilly and mountainous country between the Bi\u00e1s and the Indus as the equivalent of one crore, promising to pay the remainder in cash. This treaty was concluded on 9th March 1846. On the 16th of March following a separate treaty was entered into between the British Government and Gul\u00e1b Singh of Jammu, transferring to him in perpetual possession all the hilly and mountainous country between the R\u00e1v\u00ed and the Indus, including Chamb\u00e1, on his agreeing to pay \u00a3750,000. This treaty was shortly afterwards modified as regards the boundary on the R\u00e1v\u00ed. This river divides the Chamb\u00e1 State into two parts, and a question arose as to whether it was intended to include the whole State in the transfer, or only the portion to the west of the R\u00e1v\u00ed. Ultimately an agreement was come to whereby Gul\u00e1b Singh acquired taluka Lakhanp\u00far in exchange for the Cis-R\u00e1v\u00ed portion, and Chamb\u00e1 surrendered all claim to Bhadra-wih, for which it held a sanad from Ranjit Singh, on condition that the territory to the west of the R\u00e1v\u00ed should be restored, thus preserving the ancient integrity of the State.(1) Had the provisions of the treaty of 16th March been fully carried out, Chamb\u00e1 would have become an integral part of Jammu territory.(2) It was saved\n\n(1) Lakhanp\u00far and Chandig\u00e1n are to the west of the R\u00e1v\u00ed opposite M\u00e1dhopur, in Jammu territory.\n(2) It is said that a portion of the State adjoining the Jammu border was for a short time in the hands of the Jammu officials.\nfrom this fate by the patriotic zeal and astuteness of Wazir Bhaga, who immediately proceeded to Lahore, laid the matter before Sir Henry Lawrence, and succeeded in securing his sympathy and support, with the result stated. Bhadrawah thus ceased to be Chamb\u00e1 territory, but the rest of the State was left intact and directly under British control, subject to an annual tribute of Rs. 12,000.\n\nA sanad, dated 6th April 1848, was granted to Raja Sri Singh, conferring the territory of Chamb\u00e1 upon him, and providing that, failing heirs male of his own body, the succession should devolve on his elder surviving brother. A more recent sanad grants the right of adoption to the Chamb\u00e1 Chiefs on the failure of direct heirs, and is dated 11th March 1862.\n\nThe Chamb\u00e1 State was originally attached politically to the Jalandhar Division. The charge was in 1862 transferred to Amritsar, and when that Division was abolished in 1884, the State was attached to Lahore.\n\nIn 1851 the State Authorities were approached by Government with a view to the establishment of a Sanatorium for Europeans within the territory, and every facility was given for this purpose. A site was selected on the western extremity of the Dhaula Dh\u00e1r by the late Lord Napier of Magdala, then Colonel Napier. After the necessary observations as to climate had been made, Government sanction was given in A.D. 1853 to the transfer of certain plateaux from the Chamb\u00e1 State, viz., Katalagh, Potrain, Terah, Bakrota, and Bhangor, in consideration of which a reduction of Rs. 2,000 was made in the amount of the tribute annually payable by the State. On the recommendation of the late Sir Donald McLeod the new Sanatorium was named Dalhousie. In A.D. 1866 the Bal\u00fan plateau was also taken over for a Convalescent D\u00e9p\u00f4t for European troops, and at the same time the Bakloh plateau was transferred for a Gurkha Cantonment. For these a further reduction of Rs. 5,000 was made in the tribute. More transfers of land to Government have taken place since then, with a relative reduction in the annual tribute, which now stands at Rs. 3,800.\n\nDuring the Mutiny Sri Singh was loyal to the Government, and rendered every assistance in his power. He sent troops to Dalhousie under the late Mi\u00e1n Aut\u00e1r Singh, and also had a careful watch kept along the frontier for any mutineers who might enter State territory, many of whom were apprehended and made over to the British Authorities.\n\nWazir Bhaga retired in 1854, and was succeeded by Wazir Billu, also of the Baratru family who, with a short break, held office till 1860. There were one or two more changes, each of brief duration, previous to the appointment of a European Superintendent in December 1862; after which the office of Wazir was for some years in abeyance.\n\n---\n\n(1) Treaties, Engagements and Sanads, Vol. II, No. CXXIX.\n(2) Ditto, No. XVIII.\n(3) This small jago of R\u00e1nitar in Rihla was, however, resumed by Government.\nThe administration seems to have become much disorganized during Sri Singh's minority, and when he came of age and took the reins of government into his own hands, he found it difficult to restore order. He had married a Suket princess and the men who came with her gradually usurped all authority, the Chamb\u00e1 officials being unable to make a firm stand against them. The revenue had fallen to about a lakh, and a heavy debt had accumulated, due probably in a measure at least to the exactions under Sikh rule. Finding himself unequal to the task of dealing with the disorder into which affairs had fallen, Sri Singh, in 1862, asked the Panj\u00e1b Government for the services of a British officer. His request was acceded to, and Major\u2014now Major-General Blair Reid\u2014was appointed Superintendent, and arrived on 1st January 1863. In a short time Major Reid effected important and far-reaching reforms. All the useless servants and hangers-on about the Court were dismissed; the troops\u2014chiefly of Purbiahs and Path\u00e1ns\u2014whose allowances were in arrears, were paid up and discharged; debts of long standing were liquidated, and the State finances placed on a sound footing.\n\nTill then the forts of T\u00e1r\u00e1garh, Ganeshgarh and Prithvijor had been garrisoned by State troops, and when these were disbanded the garrisons were withdrawn, the arms removed to Chamb\u00e1, and the forts entrusted to the care of the local State officials.\n\nMajor Reid next devoted attention to the development of the internal resources of the State. In a mountainous country like Chamb\u00e1, where for ages every precaution had to be taken against aggression from without, the routes into the interior were little more than tracks; and the opening up of communications was therefore a matter of the first importance. A Public Works Department under European supervision was organized, new lines of road were surveyed, and their construction was vigorously pushed on from year to year as funds permitted. Even in the isolated valley of P\u00e1ng\u00ed, communications were much improved, chiefly through the agency of the Forest Department.\n\nIn 1863 a Post Office was opened in the capital, and a daily mail service with Dalhousie established and maintained at the cost of the State.\n\nEducational work was begun in the same year by the opening of a Primary School, the nucleus of the present High School.\n\nRealising the great importance of efficient forest conservancy, Major Reid, in 1864, moved the R\u00e1ja to transfer the working of the State Forests to Government, and this was effected by a lease (dated 10th September 1864) for 99 years, subject to revision every 20 years. Under this lease Government agreed to pay the State Rs. 22,000 yearly, and the Forests were thus placed under the direct control of the Imperial Forest Department.\nIn January 1865 Major Reid was succeeded by Captain Forbes. Plans for a Residency had already been prepared and the building was completed during his term of office. In June 1866 Lieutenant E. G. Wace succeeded Captain Forbes till Major Reid's return in December 1866.\n\nIn December 1866 a Hospital was opened under Doctor Elmslie of the Kashmir Medical Mission, in connection with the Chamb\u00e1 State. The institution was largely resorted to and much regret was felt when, in March 1867, Doctor Elmslie returned to his permanent sphere of work in Kashmir. As no one could be found to take his place, the Hospital was temporarily closed, but was reopened in February 1868 under an Assistant Surgeon.\n\nThe next two years were marked by the construction of two entirely new roads to Dalhousie\u2014via Kolri and Khajiar, respectively\u2014which not only made the journey easier, but greatly facilitated trade with the plains. D\u00e1k Bungalows were opened at Chamb\u00e1 and Khajiar. Jandra Gh\u00e1t, the R\u00e1ja's Dalhousie residence, was erected in 1870-71.\n\nMeantime the State continued to prosper, and as a result of stable government the revenue rapidly expanded, till in 1870 it reached Rs. 1,73,000. This substantial increase was not due to additional taxation, on the contrary many vexatious and petty taxes on marriages, traders, &c., were abolished, only the town octroi and bridge tolls being retained. It was due chiefly to the security of land tenure afforded by the granting of leases, whereby the area under cultivation was immensely increased; and with the opening up of communications, high prices were obtained from traders, who with their mules and bullocks were now able to visit the interior of the state for the purchase of grain and other exports.\n\nWhile these changes were in progress and everything augured well for the future, R\u00e1ja Sri Singh died after a short illness, on the 11th Assuj 1870, in the 32nd year of his age and the 27th of his reign. Though not well educated he was a wise and sagacious ruler, and had many good qualities both of head and heart. Generous and amiable in character, he was much beloved by his people, and his early death was deeply and sincerely mourned. The various reforms initiated by the Superintendents had his hearty support, for he saw in them the best means of ameliorating the condition of his people and advancing the interests of the State. His only son died in infancy, and his only daughter was married to the present Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 of Jammu and Kashmir.\n\nGop\u00e1l Singh\u2014(A. D. 1870).\u2014In the absence of a direct heir, Mi\u00e1n Suchet Singh, the younger of the two surviving brothers, laid claim to the gaddi, basing his claim on the fact that he was the late R\u00e1ja's uterine brother. The sam\u00e1d of 1848 had, however, made provision for the succession, and in accordance with it, Mi\u00e1n Gop\u00e1l Singh, the elder of the two brothers, was declared the rightful heir.\nThe order of Government directing his recognition as R\u00e1j\u00e1 was notified in open Darb\u00e1r by Colonel Blair Reid on the 25th October 1870. Mi\u00e1n Suchet Singh then retired from Chamb\u00e1, and continued to press his claim for many years, both in India and England, but always with the same result. He died in London in August 1896 without male heirs.\n\nLike his predecessor R\u00e1j\u00e1 Gop\u00e1l Singh had the assistance of a Political Officer, and Colonel Reid continued in charge. The reforms initiated in the previous reign were pushed on and the revenue continued to increase. Several new lines of road were constructed, and improvements carried out in the capital which added much to its beauty. In 1871 the school was raised to the Middle Standard and a European Headmaster appointed. The Hospital continued to attract an increasing number of patients and proved a great boon to the people in general; while the other departments of the administration were conducted with regularity and precision.\n\nOn 13th November 1871 Chamb\u00e1 was visited by Lord Mayo, Governor-General of India.\n\nOn 5th January 1872 Colonel Blair Reid proceeded on furlough and Colonel G. A. McAndrew was appointed Superintendent. His term of office was marked by another change in the administration. R\u00e1j\u00e1 Gop\u00e1l Singh had little predilection for the cares of government and difficulties began to arise. These reached a climax in the spring of 1873, and finding himself incapable of governing the country, the R\u00e1j\u00e1, in April of that year, abdicated in favour of his eldest son, Sham Singh, then a boy of seven. A j\u00e1g\u00edr was assigned him at Manjir with a suitable allowance, and there he lived in retirement until his death in March 1895. He had three sons, Sham Singh, born 8th July 1866; Bhuri Singh, born 18th December 1869, and Part\u00e1p Singh, born after his abdication.\n\nSh\u00e1m Singh\u2014(A. D. 1873).\u2014The young R\u00e1j\u00e1 was installed by General Reynell Taylor, Commissioner of Amritsar, or 7th October 1873; Mi\u00e1n Aut\u00e1r Singh being appointed Waz\u00edr. In the following January Colonel Blair Reid returned from furlough and resumed political charge of the State. The R\u00e1j\u00e1 being a minor supreme power was vested in the Superintendent and the Waz\u00edr, and their first concern was to make suitable arrangements for the education and training of the young Chief. Along with his brother the Mi\u00e1n S\u00e1hib he was placed under the care of a competent teacher, and no pains were spared to prepare him for the responsible position he was to fill. In April 1874 Chamb\u00e1 was visited by Sir Henry Davies, Lieutenant-Governor of the Panjab; in March 1875 the R\u00e1j\u00e1 was present at the Imperial Darb\u00e1r in Delhi; and in 1876 he visited Lahore, with the other Panjab Chiefs, to meet the Prince of Wales, being the youngest ruling Chief present on that occasion. On 1st January 1877 he took part in the great Proclamation Darb\u00e1r at Delhi.\nMeanwhile things had been going on quietly and prosperously in the State. Every effort had been made to develop its resources and a fair measure of success had been attained. The revenue now stood at Rs. 2,00,000 and was expanding. A Land Revenue Settlement, begun by Colonel Reid in 1876, resulted in a considerable gain to the State finances. It brought to light a great deal of land which was either very lightly assessed or had entirely escaped observation, thus considerably increasing the area under assessment. On 5th March 1877 Colonel Blair Reid retired. With three intervals of absence he had been in uninterrupted charge of the State since 1863, and it would be difficult to over-estimate his services. Coming at a crisis in its history he found it in a state of chaos, and on his departure he made over to his successor one of the most prosperous and progressive principalities in the Province, with a full treasury and an administration organised on a sound basis. It may justly be said that to General Blair Reid the Chamb\u00e1 State is chiefly indebted for the prosperity which it has ever since enjoyed.\n\nColonel Reid was succeeded by Mr. R. T. Burney, C.S., who did much to still further improve the lines of communication. An entirely new road to Brahmaur was completed as far as the 20th mile; but the project was ultimately abandoned owing to the cost which it would have involved. Of the other new roads one was carried from the capital to the Chu\u00e1ri Pass, and the other to Khaj\u00ed\u00e1r.\n\nIn 1878 Mi\u00e1n Aut\u00e1r Singh retired from the office of Waz\u00edr. In the same year Mr. John Harvey, of the Punjab Educational Department, was appointed tutor to the R\u00e1j\u00e1, and on his promotion in 1881, the vacancy was filled by the appointment of Mr. G. W. Blaithwayt. Under the care of these gentlemen the R\u00e1j\u00e1 made satisfactory progress in his studies and also acquired a taste for manly sports in which he greatly excelled.\n\nOn 17th October 1879, Mr. Burney was succeeded by Captain\u2014now Colonel\u2014C. H. T. Marshall, who retained charge till November 1885. Under this officer the roads were still further improved and a new Darb\u00e1r Hall, which is named after him, was added to the Palace. Hop-growing was introduced in 1880 under European supervision, and the industry prospered and proved remunerative, both to the cultivator and the State. It continued to flourish till 1896, but was ultimately abandoned owing to difficulties in the process of drying. The P\u00e1ng\u00ed Valley was found to be specially adapted to hop-culture. Sericulture was also tried but did not prove a success.\n\nIn 1881 a Branch Dispensary was opened at Tissa, which proved a great boon to the people of that portion of the State. In the same year a Leper Asylum, commenced by the \"Mission to Lepers\" in 1876, was taken over by the State, and has ever since been maintained as a State institution. It usually has about 20 inmates.\nIn February 1883 the R\u00e1j\u00e1 was married to a granddaughter of the Mahar\u00e1j\u00e1 of Jammu and Kashmir, and in the following year to a cousin of the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Sirm\u00far.\n\nIn November 1883 Chamb\u00e1 was visited by Sir Charles Aitchison, Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab. In May 1884 the Forest Lease came up for revision on the expiry of the first term of 20 years, and Government agreed to pay two-thirds of the profits to the State during the second term of the lease. The total revenue had now reached Rs. 2,50,000.\n\nAs the time drew near for the assumption of full power the young Chief was initiated into the art of government, for which he showed considerable aptitude. He came of age in July 1884, and in the following October was invested with full authority as a ruling Chief by Colonel C. A. McMahon, Commissioner of Lahore. D\u00edw\u00e1n Govind Chand was at the same time advanced to the office of Waz\u00edr which had been vacant since 1878. The first year of his rule was uneventful, and on 3rd November 1885 the entire burden of the administration was transferred to the R\u00e1j\u00e1 by the withdrawal of the Superintendent.\n\nThe R\u00e1j\u00e1 entered on his onerous and responsible duties with zeal and earnestness. Every department was kept under his own control and received his personal attention, and at the end of a year the Commissioner was able to report that \"The R\u00e1j\u00e1's personal interest in the management of his territory is real and its administration is satisfactory.\"\n\nIn January 1887 a Postal Convention was concluded which brought the State into direct relations with the Imperial Postal System, and resulted in a great expansion of the work of the Postal Department. Till then there had been only a Post Office in the capital, but in that year branch offices were opened at Brahmaur, Lil, Sibunta, B\u00e1thri, Tissa, Kih\u00e1r and P\u00e1ng\u00ed, thus linking up the different wiz\u00e1rats of the State. A daily arrival and departure mail service was established in connection with each, except in the case of P\u00e1ng\u00ed and Brahmaur, where the climate renders this impossible for more than six months in the summer. A special surcharged stamp was also introduced, which has been a source of revenue to the State.\n\nThe Judicial Department was reorganised on the British model but adapted to local conditions, civil and criminal appeals going from the subordinate to the higher courts, then to the Waz\u00edr, and finally to the R\u00e1j\u00e1. In the Police Department the force was increased to 100 constables under the control of an official, designated Kotw\u00e1l. The Public Works Department was also reorganised and entrusted with the care of the roads and public buildings.\nThe work of the Medical Department continued to grow under the fostering care of the R\u00e1j\u00e1, and no expense was spared to secure efficiency. The Hospital buildings, erected by Colonel Reid in 1875, were demolished in 1891 to make way for the present \"Sh\u00e1m Singh Hospital,\" with accommodation for 40 in-patients, and fully furnished with all necessary medical and surgical appliances. The Branch Dispensary, opened at Tissa in 1881, continued to attract an increasing number of patients.\n\nEducation was also fostered, and the advanced pupils were encouraged to prosecute their studies by the offer of scholarships in Chamb\u00e1 and on the plains.\n\nA small military force was formed; it consisted of 300 infantry and 30 cavalry with 4 guns, and was accommodated in neat and substantial barracks erected in the neighbourhood of the town.\n\nShortly after his investment with full powers the R\u00e1j\u00e1 initiated extensive building operations and other improvements in the capital, which were continued over a series of years. Among these may be mentioned the erection of a new Court House, Post Office, Kotw\u00e1li, Hospital and Jail. A large part of the main baz\u00e1r was also rebuilt, and the chauq\u00e1n or public promenade, within the town, levelled and extended, adding much to its attractiveness.\n\nThe palace, most of which was old, was in a dilapidated condition. Its renovation was undertaken and the greater portion of it rebuilt. In addition to these improvements by the State many new houses were erected in the town by private owners, and so great have been the changes in recent years that the capital has been transformed out of recognition, with a corresponding enhancement of its natural beauty.\n\nIn 1894 the old wire suspension bridge over the R\u00e1v\u00ed was injured by a flood, and in the following year was replaced by a substantial suspension bridge of iron at a cost of nearly a lakh of rupees.\n\nThe year 1895 was marked by an agrarian agitation, which arose in the Bhattiyat wiz\u00e1rat, and for a considerable time rendered it difficult for the State Officials to collect the revenue and provide the necessary supply of coolies for State service. As, however, an inquiry into their grievances by the Commissioner of Lahore, proved clearly that there was no good ground for complaint, the ringleaders were arrested and punished and the agitation then subsided.\n\nIn January 1898 Waz\u00edr Govind Chand was retired on pension, and the R\u00e1j\u00e1's brother, Mi\u00e1n Bhuri Singh, was appointed to succeed him. From childhood the two brothers had been greatly attached to each other, and for some years before his appointment as Waz\u00edr the Mi\u00e1n S\u00e1hib had acted as Private Secretary to the R\u00e1j\u00e1, and was thus fully conversant with every detail of the administration; and his nomination gave great satisfaction throughout the State.\nDuring the disturbances on the North-West Frontier in 1897-8 the State made an offer of a large quantity of grain for the use of the troops. This offer, like others of a similar kind, was declined, but the loyalty to the British Crown which prompted it was fully appreciated and acknowledged by Government.\n\nIn September 1900 the State was honoured by the visit of the Viceroy and Lady Curzon, who spent a week in Chamb\u00e1. The Viceregal party were accommodated in the Residency, which was tastefully furnished for them, and His Excellency was pleased to express his entire satisfaction with all the arrangements, and his appreciation of the R\u00e1j\u00e1\u2019s efforts to make the visit a pleasant one.\n\nIn November 1901 Sir Mackworth Young, Lieutenant-Governor of the Panj\u00e1b, included Chamb\u00e1 in his cold weather tour, and expressed his gratification at the efficiency of the administration and the prosperous condition of the State. The revenue had now reached Rs. 4,00,000.\n\nIn September 1902 the R\u00e1j\u00e1 was prostrated by a serious and prolonged illness, which was a cause of great anxiety throughout the State. The illness was all the more unfortunate as preparations were then in progress for the Delhi Coronation Darb\u00e1r, to which he had been invited. After his restoration to health, the R\u00e1j\u00e1 finding himself unequal to the duties inseparable from his position, addressed Government privately and expressed a strong wish to be permitted to abdicate in favour of his brother, Mi\u00e1n Bhuri Singh. After some delay his abdication was accepted, in deference to his own desire, and, on 22nd January 1904, this was notified in open Darb\u00e1r by the Honourable Mr. A. Anderson, C. I. E., Commissioner of Lahore.\n\nBhuri Singh\u2014(A. D. 1904).\u2014On May 12, 1904, Mi\u00e1n Bhuri Singh, c.i.e., was, with all due ceremony, installed as R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Chamb\u00e1, by Sir Charles Rivaz, k.c.s.i., Lieutenant-Governor of the Panj\u00e1b. For seven years the Mi\u00e1n Sahib had been associated with his brother in the administration, and discharged the duties of Waz\u00edr with such conspicuous ability as to earn the approval of Government. This was shown in 1902 when he had conferred on him the well-deserved distinction of a Companionship of the Indian Empire, in recognition of the eminent services he had rendered to the State. His accession to the gaddi was thus an event of deep significance. Highly cultured and of mature judgment, with wide administrative experience and an intimate knowledge of the State and its needs, R\u00e1j\u00e1 Bhuri Singh entered on a career of great promise as a Ruling Chief, with every happy augury of prosperity and success.\n\nIn 1904 the Forest Lease came up for revision, on the expiry of the second term of 20 years, and Government decided that, after a small deduction as interest on capital, all the profits from the working of the Forests should in future be paid over to the State. This resulted in a substantial increase of the\nrevenue, raising it to more than Rs. 6,00,000. Government has now (1907) restored the management of the Forests to the R\u00e1j\u00e1 experimentally for a period of five years, on condition that the management is to be conducted on lines approved by Government.\n\nAfter his abdication R\u00e1j\u00e1 Sh\u00e1m Singh continued to reside in Chamb\u00e1 in the enjoyment of a liberal allowance. He had not fully recovered from the effects of his severe illness, but was in fair health and nothing untoward was anticipated. His sudden demise on 10th June 1905 was thus quite unexpected, and caused sincere grief throughout the State. He was in the 39th year of his age, and at the time of his abdication had occupied the gaddi for 30 years.\n\nOn 1st January 1906 His Highness the R\u00e1j\u00e1 received from the King Emperor the distinction of Knighthood in the Most Exalted Order of the Star of India; and this signal mark of favour gave keen gratification to his subjects.\n\nAmong other Public Works the R\u00e1j\u00e1, soon after his accession, took in hand the widening of the roads in the vicinity of the capital, and the improvement of the main lines of communication in other parts of the State. These works are still in progress. In 1906 a new D\u00e1k Bungalow was built in the town of Chamb\u00e1 in place of the old one destroyed in the earthquake of 1905, and a handsome and commodious Guest-House is also in course of erection. The opening of a Public Reading Room and Library, containing the leading newspapers in English and the Vernaculars, with a large selection of standard books, has been much appreciated.\n\nIn January 1907 the R\u00e1ja was present at the Viceregal Darb\u00e1r in Agra to meet His Majesty the Am\u00edr of Afgh\u00e1nistan.\nSection C.\u2014Population.\n\nTaking total population on total area, Chamba with 40\u00b79 persons to the square mile has the lowest density of any Native State in the Punjab (the Simla Hill States being taken as one), but in a hilly country like Chamba, the density on the total area gives a peculiarly false idea of the pressure of the population on the soil. The density of the total population on the cultivated area is 789, while the pressure of the rural population on that area is as much as 752 to the square mile.\n\n| Wiz\u00e1rat. | Population | Area | Density |\n|----------|------------|------|---------|\n| P\u00e1ngi    | 5,846      | 4    | 1,461   |\n| Chamba   | 41,629     | 46   | 905     |\n| Church   | 40,901     | 48   | 852     |\n| Bhattiyat| 35,115     | 46   | 763     |\n| Brahmaur | 4,343      | 18   | 261     |\n\nThe Wiz\u00e1rats in order of density on the cultivated area are given in the margin.\n\nThe State contains only one town, Chamba, its capital, and 1,670 hamlets grouped in 49 parganas. The population of Chamba town according to the Census of 1901 was 6,000 as against 5,905 in 1891. Only 5 per cent. of the State population live in the capital.\n\nThe average population of the hamlet is 73 souls and that of the pargana 2,486. The marginal figures show the number of \"villages\" recorded at each census. In 1881 the pargana was taken as equivalent to the \"village\"; in 1891 and 1901 the hamlet.\n\nIn a mountainous country like Chamba, much of the land is necessarily unsuitable for cultivation. Large tracts are covered with dense jungle or forest, while the slopes are often so steep as to render farming operations impossible. In many places also the soil is too poor to repay the labours of the husbandman. The villages are found wherever an area of arable land exists sufficient to support a few families, and occasionally a solitary house may stand on a small patch, where there is not room for more. As a rule, however, there are several houses together, though the villages are always small. They are larger in the bottom of the valleys than on the slopes where the soil is poor and less productive. Each village stands in the midst of its own area of cultivation. On the flat the houses are all on the same level, but higher up they are arranged in tiers one above another. In the higher mountains, and specially in P\u00e1ngi, great care has had to be exercised in the selection of village sites so as to avoid all risk of falling rocks and avalanches, and though every precaution has been taken yet accidents sometimes occur from this cause. Landslips, too, constitute a danger which must be borne in mind in selecting a site for building.\nThe houses are generally square or rectangular in shape. The favourite aspects are towards the East or West, facing the rising or setting sun, but this feature is often disregarded. A northern aspect is usually avoided. In the Churah wiz\u00e1rat the houses are one or two storeys, with a flat roof, called saran. Those of the Sadr wiz\u00e1rat show greater variety, the flat roof predominating in the northern, and the bhor-d\u00e1r or slanting roof in the southern portion. In Brahmaur the houses are generally two or three storeys, and are built like bunga'ows, with projecting verandahs above. The lower storey is reserved for the cattle and sheep, the family occupying the upper storey. During summer the cattle are sent to the pasture and the lower storey is then empty. A one storeyed house is often shared by the family with the cattle, which are penned off by a wooden partition. In P\u00e1ng\u00ed and L\u00e1hul the houses are always two storeyed with flat roofs. In summer the family occupies the upper storey and the cattle are sent to the pastures. In winter the cattle are penned off by a spar partition at one end of the living room in the lower storey, the family occupying the other end.\n\nIn Bhattiyat the zam\u00edn\u0111\u00e1rs live in one-storeyed koth\u00e1s or huts, or in two storeyed houses called bhor-d\u00e1r, roofed with wood or slates or some khar grass. Well-to-do people have separate houses for their cattle, but the poorer classes sometimes pen their cattle in the house, screening them off by a partition. Others pen the cattle in the lower storey, and live in the upper storey. The door of the house faces towards the road without regard to its aspect. Bhor-d\u00e1r houses are built with a space towards the road, and a verandah or angan; koth\u00e1s are usually built touching one another, without a space for the road, but some build them leaving space for the gali or street. Good sites are chosen for houses, and in selecting them care is taken that they are not on a damp or low-lying spot. The earth of the site is shown to the Pandit and the house built after consulting him, its length and breadth being fixed under his directions. The houses in that part of the State are often more neatly constructed than anywhere else, being built of stone and roofed with slates, but sometimes they are only wattle huts.\n\nIn the other wiz\u00e1rats the village houses are strongly if roughly built, as they need to be in such a climate. The walls are constructed of a framework of wood filled in with dry masonry, and carefully plastered. When the roof is flat it is composed of wooden rafters, with small twigs or any other suitable material spread over them, and on this is laid a thick layer of pine leaves and several inches of earth. When slanting the roof is usually of shingles, but if slates are procurable they are used. There is only one door and no window, so that the interior is dark, and as the cattle are often penned up in one corner, things are anything but pleasant; but the people do not seem to mind, and living as they do so much out of doors it probably does them little harm.\nGenerally there is a verandah which adds to their comfort. A ladder, formed of a beam cut in niches leads up to the saran or flat roof, where in summer most of the village work is done. The smoke escapes by a hole in the roof, partly covered by a stone slab, to prevent the rain and snow from entering. Bee hives are often fixed in the walls. The hive is a log of wood, hollowed from end to end, and laid across so that one end is outside, and the other projects a little into the interior. In the outer end is a small hole by which the bees come and go, and the inner end is closed with mud, but can be opened at any time to extract the honey.\n\nTable 6 of Part B shows the population of the State as it stood at the three enumerations of 1881, 1891 and 1901. No census of the State was taken in 1868. In the 1881\u201491 decade the increase was 7\u00b71 per cent. followed by an increase of 3\u00b71 per cent. in the 1891\u20141901 decade.\n\nThe State has thus risen by 10\u00b75 per cent. since 1881, a greater rate of increase than that recorded in the British District of Kangra.\n\nThe following table shows the effect of migration on the population of the Chamb\u00e1 State according to the Census of 1901:\n\n| IMMIGRANTS |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1. From within the Punjab and North-West Frontier Province | 3,223 | 1,761 | 1,462 |\n| 2. From the rest of India | 3,469 | 1,989 | 1,480 |\n| 3. From the rest of Asia | 87 | 75 | 12 |\n| 4. From other countries | 6 | 4 | 2 |\n| Total immigrants | 6,785 | 3,829 | 2,956 |\n\n| EMIGRANTS |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1. To within the Punjab and North-West Frontier Province | 9,605 | 5,314 | 4,291 |\n| 2. To the rest of India | 759 | 348 | 411 |\n| Total emigrants | 10,364 | 5,662 | 4,702 |\n| Excess of emigrants over immigrants | 3,579 | 1,833 | 1,746 |\nThe bulk of the immigration is from the Districts and States and Provinces in India noted in the margin.\n\nThe emigration is mainly to the Districts and States noted in the margin.\n\nThe State thus loses 8,579 souls by migration, and its net interchanges of population with the Districts and States in India, which mainly affect its population, are noted in the margin.\n\nComparison with the figures of 1891 shows that Chamba lost by intra-Provincial migration alone 6,382 souls in 1901, or 832 more than in 1891.\n\nTaking the figures for intra-Imperial migration, i.e., those for migration in India, both within the Punjab and to or from other Provinces in India, we have the marginal data.\n\nThe State gives to British Territory 6,255 souls more than it receives from it, but the immigration is almost wholly periodic, the inhabitants of the higher ranges moving down into the Kangra and Gurdaspur plains for the winter, in which season the census was taken.\n\nThe figures for age, sex and civil condition are given in great detail in Table 10 of Part B. The following statement shows the age distribution of 10,000 persons of both sexes:\n\n| Age periods | Males | Females | Persons |\n|-------------|-------|---------|---------|\n| Infants under 1 | 118   | 113     | 231     |\n| 1 and 2     | 77    | 83      | 150     |\n| 3           | 117   | 125     | 242     |\n| 4           | 133   | 126     | 259     |\n| 5           | 115   | 115     | 230     |\n| 6           | 602   | 625     | 1,227   |\n| 7           | 573   | 471     | 1,044   |\n| 8           | 423   | 421     | 844     |\n| 9           | 381   | 408     | 789     |\n| 10          |       |         |         |\n| 11          |       |         |         |\n| 12          |       |         |         |\n| 13          |       |         |         |\n| 14          |       |         |         |\n| 15          |       |         |         |\n| 16          |       |         |         |\n| 17          |       |         |         |\n| 18          |       |         |         |\n| 19          |       |         |         |\n| 20          |       |         |         |\n\n| Age periods | Males | Females | Persons |\n|-------------|-------|---------|---------|\n| 21 and under 30 | 419   | 423     | 842     |\n| 31 and over 30 | 505   | 485     | 990     |\n| 31 and over 40 | 267   | 218     | 485     |\n| 31 and over 50 | 406   | 372     | 778     |\n| 31 and over 60 | 172   | 118     | 290     |\n| 31 and over 70 | 320   | 244     | 564     |\n| 31 and over 80 | 89    | 60      | 149     |\n| 31 and over 90 | 487   | 393     | 880     |\nIt will be seen that the proportion of long lives is higher in this State than in any other District or State in the Punjab, one-tenth of the population being of more than 55 years of age.\n\nBirths and deaths are registered only in the capital. During the past five years Chamb\u00e1 has had a recorded birth-rate of about 20 per mille, and a death-rate of 23\u00b77, rates far below those in the adjoining District of Kangra which points to defective registration in the town.\n\nThere are no statistics available for determining the birth and death-rates of the population in the whole State; Table 11 shows the rate per annum per mille of births and deaths in the town of Chamb\u00e1 for the years 1891 to 1906, and also the actual deaths from cholera, fever, small-pox and plague in the same years. Table 12 shows the monthly deaths from all causes and from fever, in Chamb\u00e1 town from 1900 to 1906, and in some selected previous years. Table 14 gives the number of persons insane and deaf-mute and of those suffering from blindness and leprosy in the State, both actually and in the ratio per 10,000, at the census periods of 1881, 1891 and 1901.\n\nThe climate of the State as a whole may be regarded as salubrious, and the people are sturdy and healthy. No epidemic of any kind has visited the territory in modern times. Malarial fevers prevail in the Bhattiyat Wizarat, and exercise an injurious effect on the physique of the inhabitants, causing enlarged spleen with anaemia, and predisposing to other diseases. In the R\u00e1v\u00ed Valley also these fevers are prevalent, though to a less extent, and the after-effects are not so marked. Goitre is exceedingly common, both in the Bi\u00e1s and R\u00e1v\u00ed Valleys, but rare in P\u00e1ng\u00ed and L\u00e1hul; being in fact chiefly limited to the area of heavy rainfall. The village of S\u00e1ch is almost the only place in the P\u00e1ng\u00ed Wizarat where this disease is found. It is seldom accompanied with cretinism, and seems to be in no way deleterious to the general health. When treatment is sought it is on account of the unsightliness, or mechanical weight of the tumour. Venereal diseases hold a sad prominence in hospital returns, and are very prevalent in all parts of the State, especially in Chur\u00e1h and P\u00e1ng\u00ed. Leprosy is also very common; and can have no association with fish-eating, for this article enters little, if at all, into the diet of the people. The worst forms of leprosy are found in conjunction with syphilis. It occurs in both the tubercular and anaesthetic varieties. Phthisis and Mollities ossium are frequently met with in the capital, but the villagers seem to enjoy comparative immunity, owing, doubtless, to the fact that they live so much in the open air. The ordinary food of the people being coarse and badly cooked, indigestion and bowel complaints are general among them. Chest diseases, especially bronchitis and pneumonia, with rheumatic affections are very prevalent in winter. Stone in the bladder is not so common as on the plains. Eye diseases also, as might be expected, are less prevalent and more amenable to\ntreatment, and the same is true of diseases of the skin. Small-pox is almost unknown in the State, owing to the systematic vaccination procedure which has been in operation for more than 30 years and is practically compulsory. Cholera and plague are also conspicuous by their absence, there having been no epidemic within living memory. Famine is also unknown. The rainfall being, as a rule, abundant, the crops are good and suffice for the wants of the inhabitants; and when scarcity or famine prevails elsewhere, the interests of the people are safe-guarded by the exercise of a judicious control over the export of food stuffs.\n\nIn Chur\u00e1h a woman who is pregnant must not cross a stream especially during the last two months. In the 7th month, seven different kinds of grain (satr\u00e1na in Chur\u00e1hi) are passed over her head and given to the poor, but this custom is not observed by all the Chur\u00e1h tribes or in other parts of the State.\n\nIn Chur\u00e1h a midwife is employed, but elsewhere the women of the household, or a relative or neighbour is called in. The midwife in Chur\u00e1h gets from four annas to a rupee if a son is born, and if a girl only a joji or cap. In the former event a man is sent to the mother's relatives with a rupee and some blades of durbh grass to convey the news, and the mother's father (or brother if her father cannot manage the journey on foot comes to the father with the durbh and a rupee, and gives him the grass and both rupees. In Brahmaur it seems the father or brother only gives and does not receive a rupee.\n\nIn Chur\u00e1h the mother's clothes are washed and she is dressed in new ones on the third day. And on this same day the good or bad fortune of the child, if a boy, is ascertained by a parohit, to whom two minis of wheat or Indian corn are sent. If he declares that the boy is from any cause unlucky, such steps are taken as he suggests. A he-goat or sheep is, if possible, sacrificed and eaten at night. Guntar (cow's urine), Ganges water and cow's milk mixed are sprinkled all over the inside of the house where the birth has taken place, and each member of the family is also given a small quantity of the mixture to drink and thereby purified. Water or cooked food touched by them is avoided by all Hindu men, but women are under no such restriction. No horoscope is cast for a girl and only among well-to-do people for a boy. The parohit receives a cholu (coat) or four rupees in cash.\n\nIn Brahmaur the guntr or guntrar (gontr\u00e1la) rite is observed on the 5th (for a girl) or 10th day (for a boy) after birth.\n\nAll the mother's clothes are washed, the house cleaned, and a mixture of gaumular, milk and Ganges water thrown over all the clothes in the house and drunk by all, both young and old, who belong to it. Then they go to the parohit to ask him about the child's future, paying him from two annas to a rupee. If he says that the child was not born under a favourable influence they resort to such charms as he may direct; but if the influences were favourable, they tie a hashtdh\u00e1ta (eight metals), a saty\u00e1ra (anklet), a surajgrah, a kangan (bracelet) and a grain of ratini (a red grain) round its wrist. For five or seven days no one eats or drinks in the room in which the child was born, and the mother remains unclean for that number of days, the ceremony for purifying her being the same as that observed on the third day. Generally no horoscope is cast, but rich people get one prepared by a Brahman and pay him from one to five rupees. Some also give new clothes to Brahmans.\nIn Lahul the mother is impure for eight days, and for that period water and cooked grain contaminated by the touch of any member of the household are not used by other people. On the eighth day the house is cleaned and plastered and clothes and utensils washed.\n\nIn Churah a child is named when three months old, a parohit ascertaining a suitable name by astrology, and receiving four annas or some grain as his fee. In Brahmaur a child is named when six months old and able to use its hands and feet. The parents usually choose the name, but sometimes it is left to the parohit. Gur is then distributed to the neighbours and among those present. In Lahul a child is named within the year, the day being observed as a f\u00eate, and a goat is sacrificed.\n\nIn Churah the child must not leave the house for five, seven, or nine months as the parohit may direct. On the day fixed a big loaf (arg) and a square loaf (bakru) containing tak\u00e1s (pice) and chaklis (a copper coin of the State) are baked and some gururas (called ghukru bakru in Churah) are roasted. These, together with some walnuts if means permit, and a he or she-calf, according to the child's sex, are taken out of the house and the calf is let loose. A walnut is then put in the child's hands and it is made to look at the sun and throw the walnut towards it. All those present scramble for the walnut in the belief that he who gets it will have sons. The rest are thrown about and the people pick them up and eat them. In Brahmaur the child is taken out sometimes in the 3rd month (hakaran) and on the day fixed water is put in a vessel, and dhup (incense), rice, luchi and walnuts collected. A few of the latter are put in the child's hands and it throws them away. The rest are also thrown about and picked up by children. Then the child is brought back into the house and the parohit, if present, is feasted on the things provided.\n\nIf the first tooth is cut in the upper jaw it portends evil (to the maternal uncle or grandmother in Brahmaur), but if cut in the lower jaw it is a good omen. The evil can be averted by giving in alms ghi, oil, satrana and clothes, as the parohit may advise.\n\nIn Brahmaur omens are taken when a child is fed for the first time. He is made to sit on the ground and before him are placed a dar\u00e1t (sickle), kod\u00e1l (hoe), paper, and khir (rice) in a vessel. If he touches the khir first he will be a glutton (pet\u00e1 rathu); if the paper, a learned man; if the dar\u00e1t, a shepherd; and if the kod\u00e1l, a cultivator and a successful man. On this occasion khir is also given to girls (three or five in number in Churah) in Brahmaur, as well as to the parohit. It is then given to the child in Churah.\n\nWhile the child is quite young it wears charms in a silver or copper cover round its neck, and a black mark is made on its forehead to avert the evil eye and malignant influences. In Churah a child under seven wears bangles (kangan) made of five metals on its hands and feet, with a surajgandh or bracelet. A pice with five holes and a rati (1) are also strung round its neck. Its forehead is also marked with some ink for five or seven years. The custom of burying the navel cord and swaddling clothes is general. This averts evil influences. In Brahmaur they are sometimes kept in a safe place but not buried, and if the child's eyes ache the cord (nahru) is taken out and rubbed on them. The clothes too are shown to a boy at his wedding and the mother says: \"these clothes fitted you when we began to rear you.\" He then gives his mother from one to four rupees.\n\nSome children, at birth or when 10, 12, or 15 months old, are passed through a fireless hearth, to avert evil influences.\n\n(1) Rati is a red seed generally used as a weight.\nIn L\u00e1hul if a woman bear several girl children in succession she wears a charmed thread round her neck in the hope of a son.\n\nIn Chur\u00e1h if a woman's children die she is placed by the parohit under a chil, pine, or fruit tree in a field and a she-goat passed over her head, while the parohit recites mantras. The clothes she is then wearing are given to him and the goat sacrificed and eaten. In Brahmaur the woman is made to bathe over the gat or hole in which the child is buried. This rite is called gat nah\u00e1n or \"bathing over the hole.\" Others take her to a holy place or a burning ground and there bathe her (tirath v\u00e0 shash\u00e1n nah\u00e1n); the bathing is carried out under the directions of a chela. A cloth is taken up by the chela, who gets a fee of five annas to a rupee. These rites are obviously designed to induct fertility from the tree or burning ground and also possibly to wash away the evil influence.\n\nDuring pregnancy the woman sets aside four chaklis (the Chamb\u00e1 copper coin) and her necklace in the name of Kaithu, the demon who is supposed to be the spirit of abortion. About two or three months after delivery the parohit and the woman worship this demon, under a walnut or a kainth tree by setting up a great stone, which is consecrated by the recitation of certain mantras and then worshipped. A white goat or a white one with a black head, is offered, an incision being made in its right ear with a kati or knife and the blood sprinkled over a cloth (a piece of motu cloth of 2\u00bd, 9 and 12 yards), and the four chaklis and some bread are also offered to the demon. Lastly, the woman tastes a bit of gur and then puts on the cloth. This cloth is used till it is worn out, and then a new one is made and worn after performing the same ceremony. The goat and the four copper coins, which were put aside when the woman first showed signs of pregnancy, are made over to the owner of the goat.\n\nThe number of males in every 10,000 of both sexes is shown below:\n\n| Census of | In villages | In towns | Total |\n|-----------|-------------|----------|-------|\n| All religions | 5,185 | 5,862 | 5,916 |\n| 1891 | 5,170 | 5,746 | 5,206 |\n| 1901 | 5,174 | 5,727 | 5,200 |\n\nCensus of 1901\n\n| Hind\u00fas | 5,160 | 5,831 | 5,186 |\n| Muhammadans | 5,398 | 5,357 | 5,390 |\n| Sikhs | 7,111 | 5,714 | 5,500 |\n\nThese figures show that the number of females has remained nearly stationary since 1881.\n\nThe marginal table shows the number of females to every 1,000 males under 5 years of age as returned in the Census of 1901. It will be seen that the proportion of girl children to boys is good in this State.\nThe figures for age, sex, and civil condition, and the numbers of the sexes for each religion will be found in Table No. 10. The following figures show the distribution by age of the population according to the census figures:\n\n| Ages       | Persons | Males | Females |\n|------------|---------|-------|---------|\n| 0\u20145 years  | 1,123   | 549   | 574     |\n| 5\u201410      | 1,227   | 602   | 625     |\n| 10\u201415     | 1,044   | 573   | 471     |\n| 15\u201420     | 844     | 423   | 421     |\n| 20\u201425     | 789     | 381   | 408     |\n| 25\u201430     | 841     | 418   | 423     |\n| 30\u201435     | 990     | 505   | 485     |\n| 35\u201440 years| 484     | 267   | 217     |\n| 40\u201445     | 778     | 406   | 372     |\n| 45\u201450     | 292     | 174   | 118     |\n| 50\u201455     | 570     | 328   | 244     |\n| 55\u201460     | 139     | 89    | 50      |\n| Over 60   | 870     | 495   | 394     |\n\nThe proportion of females to males in the State is about 12 to 13.\n\nTwelve or thirteen years is the usual age for marrying, but marriages at a younger age frequently take place. The father of the boy as a rule pays down a good round sum to the girl's father or else the boy has to work for a term, usually seven years, in the house of his father-in-law. This custom is called gharjwadintri. These practices are more usual in the country than in the city of Chamb\u00e9. Among the Gaddis the age for marrying is later than in any other community in the State; as a rule the bride is over 16, and the bridegroom 20 or more.\n\nFirst of all the parohit or two respectable men are sent to the girl's home to negotiate. If the match is accepted by the girl's father, the girl's parohit takes some gur on a fixed day to the boy's home, where it is distributed; then the boy's father and other relations accompany the parohit back to the girl's home. After eating, they throw four or eight chaklis in the vessel. Gur is then placed in the hands of the girl's sister and distributed to all her relatives, and the boy's father presents the girl with an ornament or two rupees. Then all the relatives return home and distribute gur to their brethren and other relations.\n\nWhen once a betrothal has been made, it is hardly possible to cancel it, and if one side breaks it off the other can obtain damages in court. Only death or leprosy annuls it, but if the boy's father repudiates it the girl's has no redress.\n\nAmong all castes three kinds of marriage are in vogue: (i) regular (hy\u0101h), (ii) jhanjr\u0101ra and (iii) jhind-phuk or man-marzi. Regular marriage involves betrothal (mangni) and the orthodox phera and the chhe-ch\u0101p are essential. In a jhanjr\u0101ra the bride puts on ornaments, especially the nose-ring (nath), a red string to bind her hair (dori), and a bodice (choli). In both forms o\ncustomary marriage the worship of the family god or of a lamp is essential. In a *jhind-phuk* which is the name for the connection formed with a man by a girl whose parents have not arranged for her marriage, the nose-ring is also worn. *Jhind-phuk* means \"bush-burning;\" the man and woman set fire to brushwood in the jungle and walk round it eight times, hand in hand, which completes the marriage. This custom is not common, being generally a \"runaway marriage\" and regarded with disfavour.\n\nThe *jhanjr\u0101ra* rite is customary in the remarriage of a widow or of a woman divorced by her former husband; it is also called *cholidori*, especially in the Sadr and Brahmaur *Wizarats* and *sargudhi* in Chur\u0101h. A short form of the regular marriage\u2014called *janei* in Chur\u0101h and *bujkya* in Brahmaur\u2014is common, and involves less expense. It is not unusual also for members of any of the high castes, residing in the capital, to go to the Lakshmi N\u0101r\u0101yan Temple where a short ceremony is performed which is inexpensive. In P\u0101ng\u012b and L\u0101hul there is only one ceremony for almost all occasions, called *janji* and *bydh* respectively, and it is of the simplest character. The preliminaries having been arranged the bridegroom accompanied by his friends goes to the bride's house; a feast is given, the couple being seated together on a carpet; and then the bridegroom takes his wife to his own home. A *parohit* is usually present on the occasion in L\u0101hul but not in P\u0101ng\u012b. In widow remarriage the rite is called *topi-l\u0101ni*.\n\nA mixture of oil, *\u0101ta* (wheat flour) and milk is applied to the bodies of both bride and bridegroom on the day fixed by their relations. This rite is called *tel tugri* and is accompanied by singing and the beating of drums, &c. Then the bride or bridegroom is made to worship the nine planets or *nava grah\u0101s* by a Brahman, and oil is poured over their heads by relations, every one who does so being required to throw a pice or *chakli* into a vessel whose contents go to the *parohit*. Songs are also sung, and drums, &c., played. This rite is called the *tel s\u0101nd*, and during it a girl stands by the couple with a dagger and is given two pice or four *chaklis*.\n\nAfter the one or the other of these ceremonies certain rites are observed, incense, *dhup*, and *luchhi* being offered to the family gods.\n\nPolygamy is the rule both in town and country, each man if he can afford it, having two or three, and sometimes more, wives. Polyandry, occasionally common in hill tracts, is believed to be almost non-existent in Chamb\u0101.\n\nThe percentages of widows to the whole female population of Hind\u016bs and Muammadans, respectively, are given in the margin.\n\n(1) These are:\u2014Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn, R\u0101hu (the Eclipse-demon), and Ketu (the comet).\nThe customs as to divorce and remarriage are similar to those practised in other hill districts. A man may divorce his wife by giving her a \"bill of divorce,\" generally at the instance of some other man who is desirous of marrying her. The deed is carefully written out and presented to the woman, and on the occasion of her remarriage the deed must be shown to the brotherhood, who all collect to witness this second marriage with almost as much ceremony and solemnity as in the case of a first marriage. The second husband invariably pays a sum of money\u2014anything from Rs. 50 to Rs. 100\u2014to the first. This marriage is fully recognized by the community and the custom is exceedingly common. The first man is said to \"sell\" his wife to the second and no disgrace whatever attaches to the transaction. Widow remarriage is customary in all castes in the State, except among the Brahmans and Rajputs of the capital and the Bhattiyat Wizarat.\n\nAnother curious custom, also common in all these regions, is that called chaukhandu. If a widow continues to reside in her late husband's house and she bears a son at any time while residing there, the son is considered the legitimate heir to his mother's late husband, no matter how long a time has elapsed since the death of the latter. No inquiry is made as to who the child's real father is, and the widow suffers no diminution in reputation. The son is called chaukhandu as having been born within the \"four corners\" of his mother's husband's house.\n\nThe marriage expenses are usually regulated by the position and means of the contracting families, and in most cases they are considerable. There are, however, one or two ways in which the expense is lightened especially for the poorer classes. The most important of these is the custom of tambol which is prevalent in all castes from the highest to the lowest. This is a present, usually in money, made to the bridegroom or his parents, by friends and relations, who receive a present in return of equal amount on the occasion of a marriage in their own families. Another custom called sw\u00e1j is also common. Here the present usually consists of clothes, jewelry, cooking utensils &c., given to the bride or her parents, under the same obligation as in the case of tambol. A third custom, called chad, is a present in money and kind given to the bride. The portion in kind is composed of ghi, flour, and other articles for the marriage feast, and in this case, also, a similar return present is made. This is, however, regarded in the light of a loan, and if not recovered otherwise an appeal may be carried to the law for repayment.\n\nThe favourite time for weddings is after the spring and autumn harvests. Bhadon, Chet and Poh are regarded as unlucky months for marriages. There are usually five feasts at the time of a marriage\u2014two being given by the family of the bride and three by that of the bridegroom\u2014and these involve much expense, which is a common cause of debt among the people.\nFemale infanticide was formerly common amongst the R\u00e1jp\u00fat community, and it is believed that even now there are occasional instances of the practice, but public opinion is improving in this respect. Village headmen are expected to give notice of its occurrence and offenders are heavily visited. Other castes do not seem to have ever favoured the practice.\n\nThe principal language of the State is Western Pah\u00e1ri, in five distinct dialects. Of these Chamb\u00ed\u00e1li or Chami\u00e1li is spoken in the capital and its immediate neighbourhood; G\u00e1di or Brahmaur\u00ed in the Upper R\u00e1vi Valley; Bhatti\u00e1li in Bhattiyat; Chur\u00e1hi in Chur\u00e1hi and the northern part of the Sadr wiz\u00e1rat; and Pangw\u00e1li in P\u00e1ng\u00ed. In Chamb\u00e1-L\u00e1hul the dialect spoken is called L\u00e1hul\u00ed and has some affinity with Tibetan. Except Brahmaur\u00ed, which is dealt with in the Gazetteer of the K\u00e1ngra District, a full and interesting account of each of these forms of speech will be found in the Appendix.\n\nChami\u00e1li, in a modified form, is the only dialect used in writing, and all State business with the pargan\u00e1s is conducted in this dialect; it is also in use for private correspondence. The script, is called T\u00e1kari in Chamb\u00e1, and with local modifications, is found in all the hill country between the Indus and the Jamna.(1) It is derived from the Sh\u00e1rad\u00e1, which is still in use in K\u00e1shm\u00edr, and which formerly was prevalent throughout the Punjab hills, and probably also on the plains; and it again is a descendant of Western Gupta.(2) A Printing Press in T\u00e1kari is located in Ludhi\u00e1na, where a small amount of literature in the Chami\u00e1li dialect, chiefly missionary, has been printed and published.\n\nUrdu is in use in the courts, and is fairly well understood in every part of the State. Hindi is common among the Pandits of the town. The Kashmir\u00eds use their own language among themselves, and this is also true of the Gujars. Lastly, Tibetan is spoken in the villages of the Miy\u00e1r N\u00e1l\u00e1 in Chamb\u00e1-L\u00e1hul.\n\n(1) Vide Ano, Geo. of India, page 153,\n(2) Vide pages 49-50 of the Gazetteer.\nTribes, castes and leading families.\n\nTable No. 15 gives the details as to tribes and castes at the census periods, both in the whole State, and in each separate wizarat.\n\nThe marginal table shows the relative importance numerically of the principal castes in Chamba at the Census of 1901. Amongst the remaining castes in the State, Cham\u00e1rs, Kol\u00eds, Dumnas, and Loh\u00e1rs are most largely represented.\n\nIn Chamba State Hinduism still preserves much of its early character, and has probably undergone little change for many centuries. That this should be so is not surprising, for, until recent times, few influences were at work calculated to lead to any important changes. The mountainous nature of the country made invasion difficult and conquest almost impossible, and throughout the entire period of Muhammadan ascendancy hardly any interference with social and religious customs was ever attempted. The conservative character of the people must also have tended to perpetuate existing social conditions.\n\nAt the present time caste distinctions generally are less clearly marked than on the plains, and are less stringently observed in the inner than the outer mountains. Except in the capital there are few restrictions on food among the high castes, either in the R\u00e1v\u00ed or P\u00e1ng\u00ed Valleys; rice and d\u00e1l being the only articles of diet which even a Brahman will not eat from the hands of a R\u00e1thi. In P\u00e1ng\u00ed there is a strange intermingling of castes which is very significant. There Brahmans, Rajputs, Th\u00e1kurs and R\u00e1this form one caste; for they have no restrictions either on food or marriage. In the R\u00e1v\u00ed Valley also free marriage relations exist among the high castes, good families excepted, especially in Chur\u00e1h and, to a less degree, in Brahmaur. In the village of Kukti these castes freely intermarry. In and around the capital, and in Bhat-tiyat, caste rules are in force, and in recent years there has been a tendency towards their stricter observance in every part of the State. Even in L\u00e1hul, among a people largely Tibetan in origin and Buddhist in religion, caste ideas are steadily gaining ground.\n\nThere were 16,126 Brahmans at the census of 1901. Of these a considerable number reside in the capital, but members of this caste are found in every part of the State. Some of them are in possession of sasan grants of land, the gift of former Rajas; and in few Native States have the rulers been so liberal in this respect as the R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Chamba. There are probably 150 copper plate deeds still extant, most of which are in the possession of Brahmans. In some cases, however, the grants have been resumed, and the grantees either pay revenue or have surrendered their lands.\nThe Brahmans residing in the capital abstain from all manual labour. Some are in State service in various capacities; others are engaged in trade. Many of them are very poor, and eke out a living as priests in the temples, and as purohitis and cooks in families. They are very strict in the matter of caste observance. The following are the chief Brahman gotras in the capital:\n\nBh\u00e1rdwaj, Kashyap, Upmanya, Atri, Basisht, Vishwamitra, Jamdagni, Gautam, Deval, S\u00e1rsut, Sandal, Par\u00e1sar, Kausil.\n\nThe Brahman als are arranged in three groups:\n\n1. Baru, Banbaru, Pandit, Sanju, Kashmir\u00ed Pundit, Kolue, Baid, Gutman, Bugal\u00e1n, At\u00e1n, Mady\u00e1n, Kanw\u00e1n, Bodhr\u00e1n, Bilparn, Mangleru, Lakhy\u00e1nu, Suh\u00e1lu, Nuny\u00e1l, Nony\u00e1l, Sungl\u00e1l, Bhar\u00e1ru, Turn\u00e1l, Hary\u00e1n, Purohit.\n\n2. Chunphan\u00e1n, Thuly\u00e1n, Dikhchat, Ost\u00ed, P\u00e1de, Bhat, Dogre, Pantu, Kuthlu, Ghoretu, Path\u00e1nya, Mandhy\u00e1ln, Mangleru, Katochu, P\u00e1nde, D\u00e1tw\u00e1n, Dandie, Hamlogu, Bh\u00e1rdyathu, Hanthalu, Gw\u00e1r\u00fa, Chibar, Bar\u00e1re, Datt.\n\n3. Ach\u00e1raj, Gujr\u00e1ti, Gwalhu, Bujhru.\n\nThese are all resident in the capital, and most of them enjoy sasan grants of land. The members of the first group take wives from the second group, but do not give their own daughters in return, and the first and second groups have no caste relations with the third.\n\nThe priests of the Lakshmi N\u00e1r\u00e1yan Temple belong to a family called Kolue, as their ancestor is said to have come from Kulu with the idol when it was first brought to Chamba. These priests also serve the Lakshmi Damodar and R\u00e1dha Krishna temples. The temple attendants under the priests are called p\u00e1hri and are from the Saho branch of the Bh\u00e1rdwaj gotra; they render service in turn for a fixed period according to custom.\n\nHary\u00e1n Brahmans are in charge of the Hari Rai Temple, and each of the other temples in the capital is served by its own priests and attendants. The Kanw\u00e1n Brahmans are the descendants of the Brahman family from whom R\u00e1j\u00e1 Sahila Varma acquired the plateau on which the town of Chamb\u00e1 stands.\n\nThe village of Sungal\u2014ancient Sumangala\u2014near Chamb\u00e1, is wholly occupied by Brahmans, under a sasan grant by R\u00e1j\u00e1 Vidaghda Varma, A.D. 960\u2014980, to their ancestors\u2014a Brahmacari(1) and his chela from Kurukshetra. The two families intermarry, and give their daughters to the Chamb\u00e1 Brahmans. They are all farmers but do not follow the plough, this work being done for them by H\u00e1li farm-servants residing near the village. All other farm work they do themselves.\n\nThe Brahmans of Chamb\u00e1 and Sungal decline all caste communion with Brahmans who follow the plough. The latter are called halb\u00e1h (ploughmen). The rest of the Brahman community are widely distributed throughout the State, and are, for the most\n\n---\n\n(1) The grant is in the name of the Brahmacari only, but both families enjoy the land. They are of the Kashyap and Katiy\u00e1n gotras, respectively.\npart, engaged in agricultural and pastoral pursuits in precisely the same manner as the general rural population. Many of them act as priests at the village shrines, and as purohits among the people, but they are also farmers, and engage in every kind of field work. The hill Brahmans, including the women, almost all eat flesh and in this respect present a marked contrast to the Brahmans of the plains.\n\nTheir salutation among themselves is \"namask\u00e1r,\" while from others they receive the salutation of \"paire pauna;\" to the higher castes they give the reply \"\u00e1sirbad,\" (Skr. \u00e1\u015birv\u00e1da, blessing) and to the low castes, \"jinde rah\" or \"charanji kali\u00e1n.\"\n\nThe Rajputs number 4,486, but though a small community numerically they occupy a prominent position in the State, owing to the Ruling House being of this caste. Many of the jagirdars are Rajputs and form a small aristocracy below the Chief. The Rajputs are found in all parts of the State, but are least numerous in P\u00e1ngi and most so in Bhattiyat. Some of them, especially among the Mians, retain the old prejudice against following the plough, but excepting good families they have for the most part, become merged in the general agricultural community. Many are in State service in various capacities and not a few enlist into the State and Indian armies. The Mians, as a rule, marry within their own caste, but they also take the daughters of Th\u00e1kurs, refusing, however, to give their own in return. The chief Rajput gotras in the State are the following:\u2014Kashyap, Atri, Uttam, Deval, Bh\u00e1rdwaj. The Ruling House is of the Kashyap gotra.\n\nThe Rajputs in the State may be divided into three principal classes:\n\n1st class. This embraces the 22 noble families, with their collateral branches, who formerly held rule in the hills, between the Sutlej and the Ch\u00edn\u00e1b; all of whom were originally distinguished by the title of Mi\u00e1n. Almost all of these noble families are still in existence in the direct line of descent, and where this is extinct collateral branches of the families still remain. These royal clans are popularly arranged in two groups as in the following table; each group containing eleven names:\u2014\n\n| Jalandhar Group | Dugar Group |\n|-----------------|------------|\n| Country         | Clan       | Country   | Clan     |\n| 1.

The clan names are almost all derived from the names of the countries over which the royal families of the hills formerly exercised dominion. Some of the names cannot be at once identified; for example, Path\u00e1nia, Dadw\u00e1l, Katoch, Balauria. Path\u00e1nia is derived from P\u00e1ith\u00e1n,(1) the former name of Path\u00e1nkot, which was the first seat of the N\u00farpur royal family. Dadw\u00e1l is from D\u00e1da, a place in Siba, from whence the Dat\u00e1pur family came. Katoch is the ancient name of Kangra; and Balauria is from Balaur\u2014ancient Vall\u00e1pura\u2014the first capital of the Basohli State. For the history of the States of the Jalandhar group reference may be made to the Kangra District Gazetteer, pages 24\u201446. Of the States of the Dugar group the Jammu royal family is called Jamw\u00e1l and branches of this family ruled in Jasrota, and also in Mankot\u2014now called R\u00e1mkot\u2014and S\u00f3mba. The Kashtw\u00e1r family came from Gaur in Beng\u00e1l. Behandr\u00e1lta\u2014of which the capital was R\u00e1mnagar\u2014was ruled by a branch of the Chamb\u00e1 family. Basohl\u00ed and Bhadu were to the west of the R\u00e1vi and were ruled by a branch of the Kulu family, which first settled in Balaur and later gave an offshoot to Bhadu; another branch of this family afterwards ruled in Bhadraw\u00e1hi. Hiunta is the ancient name of Chanen\u00ed proper and Bhoti (map Bat\u00ed) that of a small fief ruled by a branch of the Chanen\u00ed family; and the clan names are Hiunt\u00e1l and Bhoti\u00e1l. All the States of the Dugar group, except Chamba, were overturned between 1816 and 1840, and are now merged in Jammu. All the existing royal families reside in British territory, except those of Chanen\u00ed and Jasrota who live in Jammu.(2)\n\nThe following als or family names represent collateral branches of the Chamb\u00e1 ruling family:\u2014B\u00edjlw\u00e1n, Ranpatia, Jaghatia, Bhupatia, Chen\u00e1ria, Falgutia, Chaub\u00e1ria, B\u00e1ga\u00edwala, Parw\u00e1iw\u00e1la, Nari\u00e1l, Khud\u00eda\u00ed, Jathrunia.\n\nThe following royal clans are represented in the State:\u2014Katoch, Guleria, Dadw\u00e1l, Kotlehria, Path\u00e1nia, Jamw\u00e1l, Jasrota, Mankotia, Behandr\u00e1l, Sambi\u00e1l, Balauria, Bhadw\u00e1l, Bhadraw\u00e1hi, Kashtw\u00e1ria, Suketia.\n\nThe following are some of the collateral als of these royal clans in the State:\u2014B\u00e1ndala, Kul\u00e1n\u00eda, Kokiria, Thari\u00e1l, Malohter, Dahmari\u00e1l, Rugi\u00e1l, Jindrotia, Rany\u00e1l, Manh\u00e1s, Jari\u00e1l, Kotlia.\n\n2nd class.\u2014The following are some of the als of Rajputs in the State not descended from any of the above royal clans:\u2014Chuh\u00e1n, Sumari, D\u00e9dru, Mothl\u00e1\u00ed, Silhunia, Nanglia, Ch\u00e1rik, Rukw\u00e1l, Bag\u00e1riya, Ladhi\u00e1rch, Salehria. The following are found among the Gadd\u00eds:\u2014Chilede, S\u00e1ret, Rikhantu, Padraita, Khundail, Ghingain, Amlaitu, Charu, Jhuriy\u00e1n, Rolaita, Ghok\u00e1n, Lil\u00e1l, Thanatu, Khurkaitu, Dagaitu, Ghungrau, Suh\u00e1l\u00fa, Ordi\u00e1n, Harkh\u00e1n, Mis\u00e1n.\n\n(1) Abbreviated from Pratish\u00e1na, \"the firmly established place.\"\n(2) A short historical sketch of the States of the Dugar group will be found in the Appendix.\n3rd class.\u2014Another interesting class of R\u00e1jp\u00fats are the descendants of the R\u00e1nas or petty Chiefs who ruled in the State before the advent of the R\u00e1j\u00e1s. They number 178 souls and are included under the caste name of R\u00e1na. Those of them who are jagirdars intermarry among themselves, and claim a higher social status than ordinary R\u00e1jp\u00fats; those who have become common farmers intermarry with Th\u00e1kurs and R\u00e1th\u00eds. A full account of the R\u00e1nas will be found on a subsequent page.\n\nThe R\u00e1jp\u00fat salutation is \"Jaidiya,\" of which the original in Sanskrit was \"Jayatu Devah,\" meaning \"May the King be victorious.\" It is thus very much the same as \"Long live the King.\" It was formerly offered only to a ruling Chief or a scion of his family, and could not be assumed by any R\u00e1jp\u00fat of lower degree without proper sanction. Occasionally a Chief, being the head of the clan, might confer the privilege of using the salutation on others than the members of the royal clan, but unauthorized assumption of the title was punished with fine and imprisonment. Mr. Barnes relates the following incident, showing the importance formerly attached to the \"Jaidiya\":\u2014\"R\u00e1j\u00e1 Dhi\u00e1n Singh, the Sikh Minister, himself a Jamw\u00e1l 'Mian,' desired to extort the Jaidiya from R\u00e1j\u00e1 B\u00far Singh, the fallen chief of N\u00farpur. He held in his possession the grant of a j\u00e1g\u00edr valued at Rs. 25,000 duly signed and sealed by Ranj\u00edt Singh, and delayed presenting the deed until the N\u00farpur Chief should hail him with this coveted salutation. But B\u00far Singh was a R\u00e1j\u00e1 by a long line of ancestors, and Dhi\u00e1n Singh was a R\u00e1j\u00e1 only by favour of Ranj\u00edt Singh. The hereditary Chief refused to compromise his honour, and preferred beggary to affluence rather than accord the 'Jaidiya' to one who by the rules of the brotherhood was his inferior.\"\n\nConsiderable modifications in the popular use of the \"Jaidiya\" have taken place in recent years, and many now receive the honour who, formerly, would not have been entitled to it. The Mi\u00e1ns, however, adhere to ancient custom in the use of their honorific salutation. By a ruling Chief or the Head of a royal clan, it is received and not returned unless when offered by an equal in rank, or an heir-apparent. Among R\u00e1jp\u00fats of the first rank below the Chief it is freely interchanged, the inferior first offering the salutation and when accorded to them by their inferiors in social rank, whether R\u00e1jp\u00fats or others of lower castes, the salutation of \"R\u00e1m R\u00e1m\" is given in return. A distinction is made by some R\u00e1jp\u00fats between those who do, and those who do not, follow the plough, the salutation being accorded only to the latter and denied to the former even when of noble descent. The title \"Mian\" was formerly the distinctive appellation of the members of the royal clans. At the present time its popular application is more general, and it is often given to any one of Rajput caste.\n\nThe R\u00e1th\u00eds and Th\u00e1kurs are essentially one caste numbering 45,216 souls: of whom 37,973 are R\u00e1th\u00eds and 7,243 Th\u00e1kurs.(1) They\n\n(1) The Th\u00e1kurs are found chiefly in Bhattiyat.\nare found in every part of the State and include more than one-half of the total high-caste population, being in fact the common people par excellence of these hills. No traditions exist among them, as among the Gaddis, pointing to migration from the plains, and their great numerical importance and wide distribution seem to indicate that, for a very long period, they have been settled in the hills. In origin they are generally regarded as being the result of an amalgamation of the castes above and below them; but it seems hardly possible that such a large community can have come into existence wholly in this way. A more probable explanation of their origin is referred to by Sir J. B. Lyall. He says:\n\n\"There is an idea current in the hills that of the land-holding castes the Th\u00e1kurs, R\u00e1th\u00eds, Kunets and Girths are either indigenous to the hills or indigenous by the half-blood: and that the Brahmans, R\u00e1jp\u00fats and others are the descendants of invaders and settlers from the plains.\"(1) (2)This popular idea probably indicates the true origin of the Th\u00e1kurs and R\u00e1th\u00eds.(3)\n\nThere can be little doubt that as a hill tribe they are older than the Brahmans and R\u00e1jp\u00fats who came from the plains at a later period; and we may safely conclude that the oldest strata among them are descended, either directly or by the half-blood, from the early Aryan colonists in the hills. The first Aryan immigrants intermarried freely with the aborigines, resulting in a fusion of the two races from which may have originated the various low-caste tribes now forming such an important part of the population. But the completeness of the fusion was not at all times uniform, and later waves of immigration may have remained more or less isolated, forming the nucleus of the Aryan community which now comprises the Th\u00e1kurs and R\u00e1th\u00eds. But while this was probably the origin of the tribes it is certain that the general opinion regarding them is also well-founded. That they have received large accessions from the other castes, by defection from the Brahmans and R\u00e1jp\u00fats and by amalgamation of these castes with the Sudras, is hardly open to doubt. This is the general belief among themselves and their family traditions all tend to confirm it. We may therefore regard the Th\u00e1kurs and R\u00e1th\u00eds as being now a conglomerate people, representing the product of the welding together of many different contributions to their ranks.\n\nThe Th\u00e1kurs usually wear the janeo, but the R\u00e1th\u00eds, like the Kunets, are divided into two sections, one of which has and the other has not the thread of caste, but no names are in use to indicate this distinction. The majority are probably without the sacred thread. The name R\u00e1th\u00ed is probably derived from the Sanskrit word r\u00e1shtra,\n\n(1) Kangra Settlement Report, page 27.\n(2) A similar idea exists in Churah wiz\u00e1rat, where the Hals (i.e., lowcastes) and R\u00e1th\u00eds are believed to be the oldest inhabitants; the Brahmans and R\u00e1jp\u00fats having come in at a later period; the Th\u00e1kurs regarded as the descendants of the ancient petty rulers.\n(3) General Cunningham identified the Th\u00e1kurs with the ancient Takkas who ruled the Punjab for many centuries, and regarded them as of aboriginal origin.\nVide Arch. Survey Report, Vol. II, pages 10, 11.\nmeaning \"kingdom, people of a kingdom.\" In their general character and devotion to agriculture they present a strong resemblance to the Jats of the plains, and the high estimation in which they are held has found expression in the following popular saying:\n\nKukari siy\u00e1n: R\u00e1th\u00ed puchhiy\u00e1n.\n\n\"As the Indian corn is the first among crops, so the R\u00e1this are the most important among castes.\"\n\nThere are reasons for believing that the earliest rulers in the hills of whom we have any knowledge belonged to this tribe; and that they preceded the R\u00e1n\u00e1s, who were R\u00e1jputs and came at a later period from the plains. It would almost appear that in some parts of the hills they were displaced by the R\u00e1n\u00e1s, just as at a later time the latter were in their turn displaced by the R\u00e1j\u00e1s. These ancient petty rulers bore the title of Th\u00e1kur,(1) and in course of time this title probably acquired the force of a caste name to distinguish their families and kinsmen; and in this way the Th\u00e1kur section of the caste was formed. An exactly analogous use of a title is afforded in the word R\u00e1n\u00e1. Originally applied only to the petty R\u00e1jput chiefs it afterwards acquired a wider meaning as a caste name to differentiate the families of the R\u00e1n\u00e1s from ordinary R\u00e1jputs. It is still so used and all the R\u00e1n\u00e1 families in the State return themselves under this caste name.\n\nThe Th\u00e1kur caste, however, is larger than can be satisfactorily accounted for in this way, and we must conclude that in later times it has received large accessions from the higher castes, especially the R\u00e1jputs, by intermarriages and other connections. In past times the R\u00e1j\u00e1s used to confer the right to wear the janeo, with a step in social rank, in return for gifts or special services. It is also probable that many R\u00e1this have assumed the name of Th\u00e1kur, for in some parts of the hills the two names are regarded as almost synonymous.(2) On the whole, however, the Th\u00e1kurs rank a little higher than the R\u00e1this, and their marriage affinity with R\u00e1jputs tends to raise them still more in social rank. The Th\u00e1kur families that form such marriage affinity do not practise widow remarriage, but the custom is common among all other Th\u00e1kurs and R\u00e1this. Some of the Th\u00e1kur families claim to be R\u00e1jputs. But this claim is not acknowledged by the other castes.\n\nThese tribes form the great cultivating community in the State, and often speak of themselves simply as zam\u00edn-d\u00e1r. They are strong and robust of frame: also patient and industrious and inured to toil. At the same time they are not unwarlike and many of them join the State and the Indian armies. Except among the higher ranks and better class families, even their women in the villages engage in field labour. Their als or family names are almost as numerous as the villages they inhabit.\n\n(1) The Sanskrit word is Thakkura, of which Th\u00e1kur is a later variation.\n(2) This seems to be true especially of the Outer Hills, where the Th\u00e1kurs are most numerous.\nThe salutation \"Lu\u00e1rki\"(1) is addressed to them by their inferiors in social rank and interchanged among themselves; and to those beneath them they give the reply \"R\u00e1m R\u00e1m.\" The word is probably an inversion of the syllables of *Rul\u00e1r* meaning \"the act of salutation.\"\n\nLike the Kanets, Meos and other congeries of tribes the Gaddis or hillmen(2) are composed of several elements. Indigenous to the Brahmaur *wiz\u00e1rat* of the Chamba State they have spread southwards across the Dhaua Dh\u00e1r into the northern part of K\u00e1ngra Proper, and they give their name to the Gaderan, a tract of mountainous country with ill-defined boundaries lying on both sides of the Dhaua Dh\u00e1r, and their speech is called G\u00e1di.\n\nIn Chamba they number 11,507 souls, but these figures do not include the Brahman and R\u00e1jp\u00fat sections which return themselves under their caste names. The majority are Khatr\u00ed.\n\nThe Gaddis are divided into four classes: (i) Brahmans, (ii) Khatr\u00ed and R\u00e1jp\u00fats who regularly wear the sacred thread, (iii) Th\u00e1kurs and R\u00e1th\u00eds who, as a rule, do not wear it, and (iv) a menial or dependent class, comprising Kol\u00eds, Rib\u00e1ras, Loh\u00e1rs, B\u00e1dh\u00eds, Sip\u00eds and H\u00e1l\u00eds, to whom the title of Gaddi is incorrectly applied by outsiders as inhabitants of the Gaderan, though the true Gaddis do not acknowledge them as Gaddis at all.\n\nEach class is divided into numerous *gotras* or exogamous sections, but the classes themselves are not, strictly speaking, exogamous. Thus the Jh\u00fan\u00fan *gotar* of the Khatr\u00ed intermarries with (? gives daughters to) the Brahmans; and the Brahmans of Kukti regularly intermarry with the other groups. Similarly the *janeo*-wearing families do not object to intermarriage with those which do not wear it, and are even said to give them daughters, (menials of course excepted).(3)\n\nIn brief Gaddi society is organised on the R\u00e1jp\u00fat hypergamous system.\n\nThe Gaddis have traditions which ascribe their origin to immigration from the plains. Thus the Chauh\u00e1n R\u00e1jp\u00fats and Brahman Gaddis accompanied R\u00e1j\u00e1 Ajja Varma to Chamba in 850-70 A.D., while the Chur\u00e1h\u00e1n, Harkh\u00e1n, Pakhr\u00fa, Chiled\u00ed, Manglu and Kundail R\u00e1jp\u00fats and the Khatr\u00ed are said to have fled to its hills to escape Aurangzeb's persecutions. These traditions are not irreconcilable with the story that Brahmaur, the ancient Brahmapura, is the home of the Gaddis; for doubtless the nucleus of their confederation had its seats in the Dhaua Dh\u00e1r in which range Hindus have from time to time sought an asylum from war and persecution in the plains.\n\n---\n\n(1) Among all castes in P\u00e1ng\u00ed *wiz\u00e1rat* the salutation is *Rudr*\u2014*Rul\u00e1r*, the original form of the word; and *Rudr\u00edt* is sometimes heard in Chur\u00e1h.\n\n(2) G\u00e1ddi is possibly derived from *g\u00e1har*, an Alpine pasture grazed in autumn.\n\n(3) It is indeed stated that no distinction is now made between families which do, and those which do not, wear the *janeo*; but in former times the R\u00e1j\u00e1s used to confer the *janeo* on R\u00e1th\u00eds in return for presents and services\u2014and so some of them wear it to this day.\nThe Brahman, R\u00e1jp\u00fat, Khatri, Th\u00e1kur and R\u00e1thi sections alike preserve the Brahminical gotra of their original tribe. But these gotras are now sub-divided into countless als or septs which are apparently also styled gotars. Thus among the Brahmins we find the Bhats, from the Bhattiy\u00e1t wiz\u00e1rot of Chamba, and Ghungaintu (ghungha, dumb), both als of the Kaundal gotar. The Brahman septnames disclose none of those found among the S\u00e1rsut Brahmins of the Punjab plains, so completely do the Gaddi Brahmins seem to have become identified with the Gaddi system. Many of the als bear obvious nick-names, such as Chadhu, cross-legged;(1) Dund\u00fa, one-handed;(2) Tanj\u00fa and Tandet\u00fa, cat's-eyed;(3) Bhangret\u00fa, squinter;(4) Chut\u00e1nhru, debauch\u00e9e;(5) Ghunain, one who speaks through his nose;(6) Jukku, gambler;(7) Mar\u00e1nt\u00fa, one who fled to the plains to escape cholera, mort;(8) Jirgb, dumb;(9) Nansain, adopted by a n\u00e1n\u00ed or grandmother; Sasi one who lived with his mother-in-law.

Very doubtful instances of totemism are Phag\u00e1n 'bran (phak) eater' (Bh\u00e1rdw\u00e1i); Khudd\u00fa, 'eater of parched maize' (Sunkhy\u00e1l); Ghoknu, 'shooter of doves'\u2014 ghug (Dewal); Rikh\u00e1ntu, 'bear-killer' (Atar); Chaker, 'purveyor of chikor to the R\u00e1j\u00e1s' (Ambak); Kad\u00e1n, 'sower of kad\u00fa or pumpkins (Bh\u00e1rdw\u00e1i); Pakhr\u00fa, 'bird-shooter' (Bisistp\u00e1l).\n\nA few als refer to occupation: Charu, fr. ch\u00e1r, 'headman' (Bhardu\u00e1ri); Garhaigu, 'keeper of a stronghold,' garh (Atar); Baidu, 'physician' (Kondal); Makr\u00e1tu, 'boxer';(20) Ghingain, 'seller of ghi.'\n\n---\n\n(1) Fr. chudia, buttocks: cf. chadha, 'sedentary,' also an al name.\n(2) Fr. danda, one who has lost a hand.\n(3) Fr. tanda, cat's-eyed.\n(4) Fr. bhingra, squint.\n(5) Fr. chut, debauch\u00e9e.\n(6) Fr. gunna, speaking through the nose.\n(7) Fr. judd, gambling.\n(8) Fr. jirigar, dumb.\n(9) Fr. lattd, lame.\n(10) Fr. tiria, squint.\n(11) Fr. yalnd, to sharpen.\n(12) Fr. bari, arrow.\n(13) Fr. jhurn\u00e1, to idle or to meditate.\n(14) Fr. orda, evil.\n(15) Fr. rina, a squint.\n(16) Fr. misa, snout.\n(17) Fr. keru, brown.\n(18) Fr. dinne, black.\n(19) Fr. muka, fist.\nOthers again are fanciful: Tharrotu, from an ancestor who threatened to drag his adversary before the *thara* or court at Chamba; Dakiy\u00e1n, from one who used to dance with *dakai*, H\u00e1li, women: or uncomplimentary, e.g., Kholu, greedy; Jhurj\u00e1n, idle; Rohaila, noisy; Jhibi\u00e1n, mad; Chutrainya, debauch\u00e9e; Mukkr\u00e1n, stammerer; Gulr\u00e1n, liar; Ju\u00e1r, liar; Kuhainta, hunch-back; Kangru, scold; Jhir\u00fa, tease; Amlaitu, opium-eater; Dharambar, pock-marked.\n\nAmong the Khatris, no trace exists of the section-names current in the plains. We find occupational names: S\u00e1hnu, shopkeeper (*s\u00e1h*); Padhotar\u00fa, from one who lived on a plain (*padar*); R\u00fashhri, cook; Charhain, climber; Naklet\u00fa, mimic; Sundh\u00fa, dealer in assafotida; Bangete, a physician who powdered zinc (*bang*); Mogu, dealer in coral; Dhanehn, fr. one who lived with his flocks, (*dhan*); Panjaru, wool-comber; Ghar\u00e1ti, water-miller: with two inexplicable names; Drudhain, one who recovers stolen millet from mouses' holes; and Druhru, one who so recovers walnuts\u2014fr. *drudh*, *druhri*, a mouse's hole!\n\nTraces of totemism can hardly be said to exist in Gohaina, killer of a lizard (*goh*); Bersain, 'one who fetched *ber* trees for his flocks'; Potu, one who ate sheep's entrails (*pota*); Thapliag, one who ate wheat-cakes (*thoplu*); S\u00e1rw\u00e1n, planter of a cypress, (*Pers. sar\u00fal*); Phakolu, fr. one who was poor and ate *phak*, 'husks.'\n\nOne or two curious names are:\u2014Sangl\u00fa, carrier of a sacred chain (*sangal*); Sanj\u00fa\u00e1n, maker of offerings (*sanj*); Mangnesu, beggar.\n\nMere nicknames are Kalsain, Kalet\u00fa and Kal\u00e9ri, 'black;' Lateti, lame; Phingaletu, crippled,\u00b9 Ki\u00e1ri,\u00b2 blind; Ghusu,\u00b3 boxer, *Tatangru*\u2074 and Kachingar, dumb.\n\nAmong the R\u00e1this the *als* would seem in a few cases to be really totemistic: Mar\u00e1lotar, 'born under a *mar\u00e1l* tree,' the *ulmus Wallichiana*.

Their peculiar costume is described in the section on Dress, but it is not this alone that makes them conspicuous. Their whole bearing is characteristic, conveying an impression of sturdy independence which is fully borne out by closer contact with them. They are robust of frame, and accustomed to exposure in all weathers, owing to the migratory life so many of them lead. In their manners they are frank and open, deferential to their superiors and yet manly and dignified. They delight in festive gatherings, and are fond of singing and dancing\u2014the latter in a style peculiar to themselves. Their women are pleasing and comely, and have the reputation of being also modest and chaste. The Gaddis are a semi-pastoral and semi-agricultural tribe, and own large flocks of sheep and goats, which are their chief source of wealth. With them they go far afield, the summers being spent in the higher mountains, or P\u00e1ngi and L\u00e1bul; and the winters in the low hills bordering on the plains. This duty the male members of the family take in turn, the others remaining at home to tend the cattle and look after the farm work. Many of them own land on both sides of the Dhaua Dh\u00e1r, and reap the winter crop in K\u00e1ngra, returning in spring to cut the summer crop in Brahmaur. On the whole they are better shepherds than farmers, and perhaps for this reason they are the most prosperous agricultural class in the State. The yearly exodus to K\u00e1ngra has already been alluded to; it takes place in October and November, and the return journey in April and May. With an appearance of candour and simplicity, the Gaddis have the reputation of being good at making a bargain; hence the saying in the hills:\n\nGaddi mitr bhola,\nDinda top to mangda chola.\nThe Gaddi is a simple friend,\nHe offers his cap, and asks a coat in exchange.\n\nThe Gaddi wedding customs merit special notice.\n\nIn betrothal the boy\u2019s parents or guardians send their parohit to negotiate for a girl about whom they have information, and he brings back her parents\u2019 reply. If it is favourable the boy\u2019s parents send two or more respectable men to the girl\u2019s home to complete the bargain. Then, if it is clinched, two of the boy\u2019s family go with the parohit to perform the ceremony. If the betrothal is dharma puna this consists in the bride\u2019s\n\n(1) Fr. bh\u00e1ra, load.\n(2) Fr. palna, to sharpen.\nfather giving the parohit a bunch of drub grass with four copper coins or more, if they please, to be handed over to the boy's father in token that the alliance is accepted. The parohit hands over the drub, and the coins are returned to the parohit with a rupee added by the boy's father. The night is spent at the bride's house, and after a meal her father gives the boy's father 8 copper coins and these he places in a vessel as a perquisite to the servant who cleans it. In a betrothal by exchange (tola) the first observances are the same, but when all go to finally complete the alliance a grindstone and sil with 3 or 5 roris of gur, supari, bihan and roliyan(1) are placed before the party and then the parohit places supiri, bihan and roliyan in the skirt of his sheet and puts them on the sil. Before tapping them on the sil with the grindstone he receives 4 annas from the boy's father and mentions the names of the boy and girl whose alliance is to be formed, and then taps them. After this the supiri, etc., are placed in a vessel, with the balls of gur broken up, and distributed to those present after the girl's father has taken a bit. The elder members of the girl's family do not take any as it would be contrary to custom. The boy's father puts Rs. 1-4 in this vessel and this is made over to the bride's parents who get jewellery to that amount made for her. After this the bride appears before the boy's father and he gives her a rupee. The rest of the ceremony is exactly as described above, but in this case the coins put in the vessel come out of the boy's father's pocket. The ceremony in the other house is performed in exactly the same way, though not on the same day for the sake of convenience. A propitious date is not fixed, but a lucky day is desirable, and Tuesday, Friday and Saturday are considered unlucky.\n\nAfter having the date for the wedding fixed by a parohit two men are sent to the girl's people with a ser of ghi to notify them of the date, and if they approve of it messengers from both sides go to the parohit and get him to write the lakhnateri. For this he is paid 8 Chamba coins or 4 annas in cash, rice and some red tape (dori). At the wedding itself the sumhurat rite is first performed by worshipping Ganpati, kumbh(2) and the nine planets and then the supari (a mixture of turmeric, flour and oil) purified by mantras is rubbed on the boy. Three black woollen threads are also tied round his right wrist to protect him from the evil eye. He is then taken out into the court-yard by his mother, with part of her red sheet thrown over his head, to bathe. At the bath the black thread is torn off and he is led back by his mother. Next he must upset an earthen lid, containing burning charcoal and mustard placed at the entrance to the worshipping place, and this must be thrown away so as to remove any evil influence which he may have contracted in the court-yard. The parohit then ties nine red cotton threads round the boy's right wrist and gives him ghi and gur to taste. These wristlets are called kangana. This is preceded by the tel-sand ceremony. Again Ganpati, Brahma, Vishnu, kumbh, dia(3) and the nine planets are worshipped, and then a he-goat is sacrificed to the planets by the boy, its blood being sprinkled on the sandori (bagar grass rope) and munj mala (a ring of bagar). The sandori is then spread round the room along the cornice and the bridegroom made to don a white dhoti or sheet round his loins, to put flour roundras (jogis' ear-rings) in his ears, sling a satchel over his shoulder, tie a black woollen rope round his chest and cover his buttocks with an animal's skin, suspend a fanani (bow for carding wool) to the black rope and take a timbar stick in his right hand with a Brahminical thread.\n\n(1) Roliyan red colour for marking the tika on the forehead: bihan, coriander.\n(2) Kumbh. A small pitcher filled with water, is placed over a handful of rice and peach leaves or a few blades of drub are put into it. It is worshipped exactly like the deotas.\n(3) Dia. A small earthen lamp with a burning wick is placed over a handful of rice and worshipped like the others.\ntied round his right thumb. This dress is assumed so that he may appear a regular jogi (ascetic). After this the presiding priest asks him: 'why hast thou become a jogi?' His answer is 'to receive the Brahminical cord.' Then he is further interrogated by the priest as to what kind of cord he requires, i.e., one of copper, brass, silver, gold, or cotton, and he asks for the latter. The priest then sends him to bathe at Badrinarain, Triloknath and Mani-Mahesha, and these supposed baths are taken in turn by dipping his hands and feet in, and pouring some water on his face from, a vessel put ready for the purpose in the door-way. After these ablutions the pretended jogi begs, first of his relations, and then at the house, and they give him a piece of bread and promise him cattle, goats, etc., according to their means. In conclusion the priest asks him whether he wishes to devote himself to j\u0101tera (worldly business) or m\u0101tera (an ascetic life) and he invariably answers 'to j\u0101tera,' and then the priest makes him take off his jogi's clothes, receiving 4 annas as his fee for this. The cattle, etc., which the relations promised to the boy go to him and not to the priest.\n\nThis over, the boy is made to sit on a wicker basket, or a sheep-skin bag for carrying grain (called khalru) and a dagger is placed on the munj m\u0101l\u0101(1) above his head. Then the people pour oil over his head, with a few blades of grass (drub), taken from a vessel containing oil and held by his mother's brother or in his absence by her sister. After this the bridegroom fits an arrow to the fanani (bow) and shoots it at the head of the dead goat which is placed over the nine planets, thereby pretending to slay them. The rite of tasting gur and ghi by the boy ends this ceremony. The bridegroom is then dressed. He wears a white pagri (turban) and kuw\u0101, a red luancha, and a white patka with gullbadan suthan and a jau(2) thrown over the shoulders. The present (suh\u0101g-pat\u0101ri) is then arranged. It consists of a kharb\u0101s(3) luancheri, ghagaru,(4) nau-dori,(5) ung\u012b,(6) chund\u012b,(7) k\u0101ng\u012b, manihir, 3 roris of gur, dates, grapes, almonds, rice and 7 l\u016bchis, and these are carried by the parohit to the bride's house, with the procession. The boy is then veiled with a purified veil (sehra) by his mother's brother, his brother's wife puts antimony on his eyes, and his sister fans him. After this the boy gets up and the \u0101rt\u012b is then waved thrice from right to left over his head by the parohit, and his mother throws three round cakes (l\u016bchis) on three sides of him. The \u0101rt\u012b must be sanctified by mantras before being used at the door. After this the boy's father gives him the tambol (present) of Rs. 1, and 4 copper coins, the latter being the parohit's fee. The boy then gets into a dol\u012b in the court-yard and his mother gives him her breast to suck. The p\u0101lk\u012b is then carried by four bearers to the entrance, beneath the wooden parrots called toran, which the boy, his mother and the parohit worship, and then the bearers present the boy with a kumbh filled with water and he puts a copper coin in it. The bridal procession, consisting of the male members of the house and friends, dressed in their best clothes and preceded by tom-toms, goes to the bride's house. On arrival the boy with his followers is put up in a house other than the girl's, or camps out in the open air. The boy's father or uncle, with one or two more, then takes a basket full of round cakes to the bride's parents; this is called batpartana. They return from the bride's house after eating something and putting 4 copper coins in the plate, and rejoin the\n\n---\n\n(1) A small ring or wreath made of bugar grass.\n(2) All these are articles of dress.\n(3) Kharb\u0101s, a dopata of white cotton cloth: luancheri, the bride's dress.\n(4) Ghagru, coloured cloth for a skirt.\n(5) The nau-dori or '9 doris,' are red cords, four on either side at the back of the head, plaited into the hair and converging into a ninth thick dori which hangs down the back.\n(6) Ung\u012b, of iron with which the hair is parted in front: the k\u0101ng\u012b is a comb.\n(7) Chund\u012b is an antimony-holder for the eyes, worn on the back of the head!\nprocession. This observance is called *juth p\u00e4i*. Two respectable men are also deputed to the bride's *parohit*, to settle the amount he will take for performing the rites at the *lagan*, and then rejoin the camp. The boy's *parohit* then proceeds to the bride's house to deliver the *barsuhi* (bride's dress) to her. The *barsuhi* consists of a white sheet (*dupatta*), *luancheri*, *ghagar\u00e1*, *nau-dori*, *ungi*, *k\u00e1ngi* (comb), (articles of attire) *ch\u00fandi*, 3 balls of *gur*, cocoa, dates, grapes, almonds, 1 ser of rice and 9 *l\u00fachis*, 3 wheat cakes, 7 *puris* of *chandan ch\u00fara*, *roliy\u00e1n*, *kesar*, *sandh\u00far*, *nah\u00e1n\u00ed*, *muth* and *sup\u00e1ri*. The priest then comes back to conduct the bridegroom and his followers to the bride's house with tom-toms playing. The boy is received at the entrance by his mother-in-law who performs the *arti* ceremony over him, waving it seven times over his head with her right hand, holding her left over his turban. Four turns are taken from the boy's right to his left and three in the reverse direction. Three cakes, placed in the plate with the *arti*, are also thrown out towards the court-yard. The priest gives 4 *chaklis* (copper coin) to the boy who then places them in the *arti* after clasping his hands before it. The mother-in-law then retires, while the father-in-law comes to the spot and placing a *patka* (white cloth) round his own neck, washes and worships his son-in-law's feet. The boy's priest gives a *duna* (leaf-plate) with some rice, a walnut, *drub* and flowers into his hands. Both the palms are held upwards, with both thumbs joined and held up by the father-in-law in his hands who brings the bridegroom into the verandah while the *mantras* are being recited. After this the bride is brought to the place and made to stand a foot from him face to face with the bridegroom. The priest then takes hold of the boy's neck with his right hand and of the girl's with his left and makes their shoulders thrice touch each other, first pressing the boy's right to the girl's left. This is called *ch\u00e1n par ch\u00e1n*. After this two torches are held on either side of them. Seven small pieces of *m\u00e1l\u00ed* (jasmine) twigs are then put in the girl's hands, she drops them into the boy's hands and he breaks them one by one, placing them under his right foot. This breaking of the twigs is called *chiri*. It is preceded by giving *bihan* into the hands of the couple and they blow it at each other. This goes by the name of *far\u00fari*.\n\nThe pair are next made to sit down and the boy's father-in-law offers *sankalap*, that is gives his daughter away, and then washes the couple's feet as they sit before him. Certain minor rites, called *ch\u00edch\u00e1ri*, are now per-\n\n(1) It will be observed that the *barsuhi* consists of the same articles as the *suhdg-pat\u00e1ri*.\n(2) Sandal-wood chips.\n(3) A sweet-smelling root: *muth*, the root of a kind of grass.\n(4) *Sup\u00e1ri* betel-nut: *kesar*\u2014saffron.\n(5) *Ch\u00edch\u00e1ri*: Two or three blades of *drub* are tied together with red cotton thread and placed in a cup of green leaves, *Thea* a *chakli* (copper coin) *til*, rice, *rolian* (turmeric), some flowers, water and a walnut are also placed in it. This cup is put in the bridegroom's hands and his father-in-law's hands are laid over them. The priest then recites some *mantras*, after which the *drub* is taken up by the father-in-law and with it he sprinkles water from the cup thrice over the heads of the pair. This is called the *pahla bishkar* or first *ch\u00e1r*. This is repeated, but the second time some blades of grass, *kesor* (saffron) *sarvan shadhe* and flowers are thrown into the water. While the priest recites *mantras* the father-in-law sprinkles water on the couple's feet. This second rite is called *pid\u00e1*.\n\nThe third or *ary* ceremony is similar, but this time the mixture is made of *dhain*, *til*, *drub* and rice, and after reciting *mantras* it is sprinkled over the boy's head.\n\nThe fourth *ch\u00e1r* is called *daa bishkar* and is an exact repetition of the first *ch\u00e1r*.\n\nThe fifth *ch\u00e1r* (*achmani*) is solemnised by putting water, *til*, and rice in a cup which is placed on the ground as was done in the other *ch\u00e1rs*, but at the end of the ceremony the priest thrice throws a few drops of water from the cup on to the father-in-laws' hands, and the boy and they drink it from his hands.\n\nThe sixth and last *ch\u00e1r* is called *madh\u00faparak*. The cup is filled with milk, *til* and rice, and put in the boy's left hand; he daubs the four fingers and thumb of his right hand with it and then lifts his hand towards his mouth and, putting it again into the cup, sprinkles its contents on the ground. This cup is then taken by one of the bridegroom's *jan* (one who has come with the procession) and given to the tom-tom player. This *jan* returns to the bridegroom and after being purified by *mantras* is allowed to mix again with the other men.\nformed by the bridegroom and his father-in-law. Then Ganpati,\\(^{(1)}\\) Brahma,\\(^{(2)}\\) Vishnu,\\(^{(3)}\\) Kumbh, dia and the nine planets are worshipped. After this one end of the girl's sheet is held out by her brother and on this red tikka is sprinkled thrice by the boy. Similarly the boy's waist-band is held out and anointed by the girl. The girl then holds up her hands, and into them 4 copper coins, a walnut, drub, flowers, til, and rice are thrown by the priest, and then the boy is made to lay his hands over hers. The priest then takes part of the bride's sheet and wraps both pairs of hands in it by running a tape (dori) round it.\n\nThe girl's father then performs the kani\u00e1-d\u00e1n (giving the girl away) with the proper mantras. At its conclusion the girl's maula (mother's brother) touches her wrapper with a copper coin and it is then unknotted, the things in the girl's hands being taken by the boy and given to the parohit. The gur and ghi is then tasted and this concludes the ceremony called lagan. The girl now retires, but the boy remains to go through another rite called the manih\u00e1r.\\(^{(4)}\\) After doing the \u00e1rti over the bridegroom, the tape with the betelnut is then put on the boy's left toe and he is required to pierce the nut with his dagger. This done, the priest takes the tape up and throws it over the boy's head, passes it down to his heels and under his soles, and then ties it round the pagri. The boy is then drawn by the manih\u00e1r by his mother-in-law and led inside the house to the k\u00e1mdeo.\\(^{(5)}\\) The girl is also brought there by her brother and dressed in the bars\u00fahi clothes and placed by the boy's side before the picture. Finally the remaining 7 doris of the bars\u00fahi are handed over to the boy by the girl's mimi (mother's sister); he places them on the bride's head and then her hair is combed and arranged with these doris by her m\u00e1mi and the following song is sung:\n\n**SARGUNDHI SONG.**\n\n*Kun gori baithi sir kholi, hor  \nKun baith\u00e1 pith gheri,  \nGaura baithi sir kholi, hor  \nIsar baith\u00e1 pith gheri.*\n\n\"Who is that beautiful girl sitting with her hair dishevelled?  \nWho is sitting with his back turned?  \nOh, Gaura is sitting with her hair uncombed.  \nIsar (Shiva) is sitting with his back turned.\"\n\nAfter this the boy's jaul (shoulder-band) and the bride's kharv\u00e1s (sheet) are knotted together and the bride is carried by her maternal uncle (maula) to the canopy where the wedding is to be celebrated.\n\n---\n\n\\(^{(1)}\\) Ganpati is represented by a walnut in a green cup, placed before the boy under the canopy on a heap of rice. It is given a copper coin\u2014Gaupati being thus invoked to keep off mishaps.\n\n\\(^{(2)}\\) Brahma's effigy is made of a few blades of drub, which are turned down twice, the ends being fixed in cow-dung and placed in a green cup. He is then similarly worshipped, as being the Creator of the universe.\n\n\\(^{(3)}\\) Vishnu is represented and worshipped like Brahma, but the blades are only turned down once from the centre in his case. Vishnu is worshipped as being the first cause and the protector of the universe.\n\n\\(^{(4)}\\) Manih\u00e1r.\u2014Nine walnuts (the nine planets) are put on rice and worshipped and their blessing invoked. There must be a separate handful of rice for each of the walnuts. A bored copper coin, a betelnut and a cotton dori (three cords about 1\u00bd spans long)\u2014all these together are called manih\u00e1r\u2014but the ceremony is performed by taking the boy out to the doorway and then he takes out his dagger from the waist and touches the coin with its point, pretending to bore it. The string is then passed through the bored coin and put in a m\u00e1ni (grain measure) and then the manih\u00e1r is sanctified and tied round the boy's head-dress by his mother-in-law at the gate-way after the \u00e1rti.\n\n\\(^{(5)}\\) A picture.\nUnder this canopy (baid) they are placed, on bamboo baskets covered with woollen cloths, facing east. The bridegroom sits to the right of the bride and in front of the sacred fire (homa or havan). The bride's father then washes the couple's feet; after which Ganpati, Navagarah, Brahma, Vishnu, Kumbh, Sat Rishi, Chaur Vedi, Chaun-disa (the four quarters) and Chaun-updes (the four elements) are worshipped in due order, to ward off mishaps. This is followed by placing fried barley in a chhaj (sieve) which is brought to the baid. First, the bridegroom takes a handful of this grain and puts it on three different spots, while the bride's brother keeps wiping it away with his right hand as fast as it is put down. This is repeated, but the second time the bride's brother puts the grain down and the bridegroom wipes it away. This is called khila(1) khedni and is done to break the tie of relationship, if any exists, between the contracting parties. After this khila khedni the boy's father puts 4 annas into the chhaj(2) and the bride's brother takes off the red piece which he has worn on his head during the ceremony and puts it in the chhaj too. It is then removed and the 4 annas are claimed by the boy's brother-in-law. Then the bride's brother's wife comes and grinds turmeric (haldar) on the sil and sprinkles it wet on the feet of the pair, three times on each. She receives 4 takas, i.e., 16 copper coins, for performing this rite. Then the couple are made to stand up and walk round the sacred fire four times from right to left. The bridegroom keeps his right hand on the bride's back all the while. After each turn they are made to halt near the baskets and their feet are worshipped, by throwing til, drub, milk, and red colour, etc., by the bride's father, and at the end the bride's brother worships the couple's feet in the same way. These four rounds are called charlai, and constitute the binding rite in the wedding.\n\nAt the charlai two women sing the following song:\n\n**CHARLAI SONG.**\n\nPahlia lajaria phirde kuadre,\nDijia lajaria phirde Isar Gauraja,\nTrija lajaria anjan dhrir lai,\nChauthia lajaria anjan tori nahsa.\n\n\"In the first round of the lai go bachelors,\nIn the second round of the lai go Ishwar and Gauraja.\nIn the third round they let the anjan(3) drag on the ground,\nIn the fourth round the dulha (bridegroom) broke it and ran away.\n\nThe bride and bridegroom now change seats and sit facing each other. The bride then holds up her hands and in them a green leaf cup (dun\u00e1) containing some walnuts, rice, flowers, 4 coins, etc., is placed by the priest. The bridegroom covers the bride's hands with his hands and then the priest unknits the manihar from the boy's pagri and puts it on their hands. The bride's father then takes til, drub, rice, flowers and copper coins and the sankalap is performed to the recitation of mantras. After this he places 4 copper coins and a rupee in the vessel containing water, turmeric, milk and curds and sprinkles the mixture on the baid (canopy). This is called saj pana or giving of dowry. The bride's mother's brother then comes and touches the boy's and girl's hands with a ser of rice and a copper coin and then they are released, the manihar being given to the girl to be put round her neck. The rice and coin go to the priest. After this all the girl's other relations and friends give her presents, either in cash or in kind, according to their\n\n---\n\n(1) Parched grain.\n(2) Winnowing fan.\n(3) In the marriage ceremony the boy wears a long strip of cloth round his shoulder and the girl a kharus (coloured sheet) over her head. Both these are tied together when they do the charlai and the knot which fastens them together is called anjam.\nsocial position. These presents are then divided thus:\u2014To the bride's and bridegroom's parohits 2 annas each; to the bride's palki-carriers 4 annas; to the bridegroom's the same; and to the carpenter (b\u0101dhi) who erects the temple and the canopy (baid) 4 annas also; to the bride's musicians 2 annas; and to the bridegroom's 4 annas. After this the bride's parohit counts the things received in dowry, receiving for this 8 copper coins, with four more as dehl (door-way) for acting as the family priest. Of the residue a 4th goes to the bride and a 10th of the remainder is appropriated by her priest. The balance with the canopy is then given by the bride's father as sankalap to the boy's father and forms part of the paraphernalia. After this the gotra-ch\u00e1r mantras are read and fried rice is thrown towards the couple by both the priests. Each gets 4 annas for reading the gotra-ch\u00e1r. This is followed by making the fathers of the couple sit under the canopy, and a blade of drub is put by the bride's priest into the girl's father's hands. He holds it between the tips of his middle fingers at one end, the other end being similarly held by the boy's father. The bride's father then says: \"asmat kania, tusmat gotra,\" meaning \"our girl passes to your got.\" The ends of the blade are then reversed and the boy's father says: \"tusmat kania, asm\u0101t gotra,\" meaning \"your girl has come into our got.\" At the conclusion the bridegroom comes to the end of the canopy where he receives rul\u00e1r (salutation with a present) from his mother-in-law and the other elderly women of the bride's house. The mother-in-law gives a rupee in cash and 4 copper coins, the others only copper coins, and without receiving this gift from the women it is not etiquette for him to appear before them. The boy touches the bride's mother's feet in token of her giving him this privilege. The ceremonies at the bride's are now over and the bride is taken in the palki, with all the paraphernalia, followed by the bridegroom, his followers and friends, to his house.\n\nSong sung on the bride's arrival at the bridegroom's house\u2014\n\nSoi (pichaik) aunde-jo \u00e1dar de\u2014junde-jo bhal\u00ed m\u0101r;\nHallare junde-jo mochar-m\u0101r\u2014bhale bhale \u00e1dar.\n\n\"Receive the soi (those who come with the bride) with courtesy and on their departure give them a good thrashing.\nGive to this hallar (bastard) a shoe-beating, this is good treatment for him.\"\n\nOn arrival at the door-way the following song is sung:\n\nATHLAI SONG.\n\nHam ku p\u00fajna kun gori ai,\nHam ku p\u00fa na Gaura ai,\nHam ku p\u00fajde putri phal mangde.\n\n\"Who is that beautiful girl who has come to worship a pomegranate tree?\nIt is Gaura who has come to worship,\nWhile she is worshipping she is praying for a son.\"\n\nThen the \u00e1rti is presented by the boy's mother and she also gives the bride a rupee. Next the pair are conducted to the k\u00f3ndeo (picture on the wall,) and Ganpati, etc., are worshipped, after which they are both made to go four times round the earthen lamp (diwa) and kumbh (pot containing water), tape and a bunch of pomegranate. This circumambulation is called the athl\u00e1i (eight rounds).\nAfter this the bridal veil is taken off by the parohit and the imitation birds on the veil are given to the priest, the brothers of the couple and their newly acquired mitras (brothers made by sacred observance). Having done the athlai the bride and bridegroom's wrist threads are loosened by two men who thus become brothers. These threads were put on by them at the commencement of the preliminary observances.\n\nAt the conclusion the bridegroom receives presents (tambol) from the men and women, and similarly munhaani from the women is received by the bride for unveiling her. Songs are sang by the women on these occasions.\n\nThe following feast-song is sung at the bridegroom's house:\n\nKuniaye chauka p\u00e1ya, kuni dhotore hath pair,\nJanne chauka p\u00e1ya, soi dhotore hath pair, darohi R\u00e1m R\u00e1m,\nBhat parith\u00e1, m\u00e1s parith\u00e1, upar parithe t\u00e1re m\u00e1re,\nBhate m\u00e1se kh\u00e1na j\u00e1n\u00e9, soi bahin kardi h\u00e1re h\u00e1re.\n\n\"Who has smeared the floor with cowdung; who has washed the hands and feet?\nThe jan (followers of the bridegroom) have done it, the soi (followers of the bride) have washed their hands and feet: we appeal to R\u00e1m (for the truth of our statement),\nBoiled rice has been given, meat has been given, over them have been given small pebbles,\nThe soi know not how to eat rice and meat, the sister expresses surprise (by saying) 'h\u00e1re h\u00e1re'.\"\n\nFour feasts are given in the boy's house to the guests: 1st, on the day of the oil ceremony; 2nd, on the morning on which the procession starts to the bride's house; 3rd, on the day the procession returns home, and 4th, on the morning on which the bridegroom receives presents.\n\nThe first two feasts are given at the bride's house on the oil day to the guests of the girl and the last two on the marriage day to the bridegroom and his followers and to the bride's guests.\n\nAnother form of marriage called bujky\u00e1 is common in which the ceremony is gone through only at the bride's house, thus saving expense.\n\nThe Gaddis also practise the form of marriage called jhind-phuk, solemnised by burning brushwood and circumambulating the fire eight times hand in hand, or with the bride's sheet tied to the boy's girdle. It is admissible in cases where a girl's parents have consented to her betrothal but refuse to carry out the marriage, and is sometimes done forcibly by the bridegroom; or in cases in which a girl elopes with her lover. No priest or relative need attend it.\n\nWidow remarriage is permitted except among the Brahmans. The rite is called gudani or jhanjar\u00e1ra and also choli-duri and is solemnised thus:\u2014The pair are made to sit down by the diwa and kumbh, with some dh\u00fap burning. They worship both these objects, then the bridegroom places a dor\u00ed (tape) on the widow's head and another woman combs her head and binds her hair with the tape.\nAfter this the bridegroom places a nose-ring (b\u0101l\u016b) in the woman's hand and she puts it on. This is the binding portion of the ceremony. A feast is given to guests and relations and songs are sung. If no priest presides at the ceremony the kumbh, etc., worship is dispensed with, but the tape and ring ceremony is gone through and the guests, etc., feasted. A widow used to be compelled to marry her husband's elder or younger brother, but the custom is no longer enforced by the State.\n\nDivorce is permitted by mutual consent, but there is no special form. A divorc\u00e9e may re-marry.\n\nSons, whether by a wife married for the first time, or by a widow or divorc\u00e9e re-married, succeed, but illegitimate sons do not, unless they are adopted in default of legitimate sons or heirs. The eldest son gets an extra share, called jaithund, but he has per contra to pay a proportionately larger share of any debts. Among the sons the property is otherwise divided mundavand, i.e., equally, except in Kangra, where the chundavand rule prevails among that small part of the tribes, which originally came from the southern side of the upper Ravi in Chamba.\n\nThe Gaddis also have the custom whereby a widow's child (chaukandhu) born at any time after her husband's death succeeds to his property, provided that the widow has continued to live in his house and has worn a red dori (tape) in the name of his chula (oven) or darat (axe). Cases have even occurred in which the widow has retained her late husband's property without complying with these conditions, though the Gaddis consider her rights disputable.\n\nGaddis burn their dead. Lepers and those who die of luhar, a kind of typhus, are first buried, but their corpses are exhumed after three months and burnt. The ceremonies performed are the same as for those who are burnt. The body is placed on the funeral pyre with the head of the deceased to the north, and all the jewellery and the blanket, which is thrown over it when on the bier, are taken off and the body burnt. A copper coin is placed by the pyre as the tax of the land on which the body is burnt. Fire is first applied to the pyre under the head by the nearest relative and the other gotris (blood relations). The parohit joins the relations in this observance, but no ceremonies are observed. The light is applied after going round the pyre once from left to right. On the 10th day after the demise the daspindi ceremony is performed by the nearest blood relations, with the aid of the parohit. Other relations wash their clothes and bathe on this day and remove the kambal which is spread to receive the mourners. On the 12th day, at night, a he-goat is sacrificed in the deceased's\n\n(1) Sir J. B. Lyall's Kangra Settlement Report, Section 74, quoted in P.C.L.II, page 183.\n(2) In allusion to the idea that the Muhammadans own the world, Hindus the sky, and that the owners' land must not be used unless paid for.\nname. This goat is given to the parohit. Next morning five pinds (balls of rice) or one supindi are again offered to the deceased by the chief mourner, to the recitation of mantras by the parohit. The clothes, utensils, cash, etc., are given to him. On the 14th day the deceased's relations on the wife's side come to the house in the morning and give a feast to the brotherhood. A goat is killed for this feast and the mourning ceases from this day. At the end of the third month oblations are again offered to the deceased and the occasion is signalised by a feast to the brotherhood. All the offerings made in this ceremony go to the parohit who presides over it. Similar ceremonies are gone through at the end of the sixth month and the 1st and 4th years.\n\nIf buried the body is laid flat in the grave with the back on the ground and the palms of both hands folded on the chest. The head is kept to the utar (north). Children and females are buried in the same way. When burnt the ashes are collected, together with the seven bones of the finger, knee and ankle joints, on the day the corpse is burnt. They are brought to the house in a piece of masru(1) and kept for ten days in the clothes in which the deceased breathed his last and in the room in which he expired. After the daspindi they are washed in honey, milk, clarified butter, cowdung and bilpatri seed and then dried and deposited in a small wooden box, wrapped in the piece of masru and buried in a recess made in the wall of the house, with a coating of barley and mustard over it. They should be taken to Hardwar to be thrown into the Ganges as soon as the family has collected sufficient funds for the journey, and at most within four years.\n\nThe religion of the Gaddis presents some interesting features. As we have seen the Gaddis are by preference Shaivas,(2) but their worship is catholic to a degree. Thus on Sundays and Thursdays N\u00e1gs and Sidhs are worshipped, on Sundays alone Kailung, Devis on Tuesdays, and on Thursdays 'B\u00edrs.'\n\nTo the N\u00e1gs, ahri or beestings, male kids or lamb and ora, (the first-fruits of all crops), incense and small cakes are offered; and to the Sidhs a sack, a stick of rose-wood, a crutch, sandals and rot or thick bread.\n\nTo the Devis are offered vermilion, bindli, (brow-mark) s\u00e1lu, (a red ch\u00e1dar), dora (waist-rope) sur, (a coarse spirit), and a goat.\n\n---\n\n(1) The cloth in which the corpse is wrapped.\n(2) As the verse goes:\u2014\nGaddi ch\u00e1rda bhedan:\nGaddin dindi dupa,\nGaddi jo dinda bhedan\nGaddin jo dinda rupa.\nThe Gaddis feeds their flocks:\nThe Gaddins offer incense (to Shiva),\nTo the Gaddis he (Shiva) gives sheep\nAnd to the Gaddins, beauty.\nTo the Bira a he-goat, a chola or thick woollen coat, a waistband, a white conical cap (chukanni topi) and fine bread. Kailu B\u00eer, the numen of abortion, is only worshipped by women. Kailung is a N\u00e2g, and the father of all the N\u00e2gs. He is worshipped, as is Shiva, under the form of the dar\u00e2l or sickle, which is always carried by a Gaddi when shepherding his flocks. Then there is the worship of autars. An autar is the spirit of a person who has died childless, and causes sickness. To propitiate this spirit the sick person dons clothes, which are made for him, with a silver image of the deceased, and he then worships the autar idol (which is always set up near a stream).\n\nThe clothes and image are worn \"in token of the deceased.\" Autars are said to have been admitted into the category of the deities owing to their evil influences on men and women. They are propitiated also on the Am\u00e2was and Puranm\u00e2shi days.\n\nAutars also appear in dreams and warn people that they will carry them off to the next world. To scare away the ghost in such a case jamanec\u00e2la is performed, 4 balis, offerings of ghunganian (boiled maize), nettle baths, and bran bread being offered four times by night.\n\nBut these do not exhaust the list of beliefs. Bat\u00e2l is the sprite of springs, rivers and wells, and khicheri, sodden Indian corn, 3 balls of nubal (moss), 3 of ashes, 3 measures of water, a pumpkin or a flour-sheep are offered to him.\n\nTo joginis or rock spirits, 3 coloured grains of rice, 5 sweet cakes, a loaf, a flour-lamp with a red wick, 3 kinds of flowers, 3 pieces of dhup, and a she-goat are offered with prayers. R\u00e2kshanis and Ban\u00e2sats would seem to be the same as joginis. Chungu is the demon found on walnut and mulberry trees and under the karangora shrub. He is worshipped with a cocoa-nut, a chuhora (handle of a plough), almonds, grapes, milk and a loaf of 5 paos with his effigy in flour (a basket on his back) a four-cornered lamp of flour on the bread, and a piece of dhup.\n\nGunga, the disease-spirit of cows is propitiated by setting aside a tawa of bread in his name until the final offerings can be made. Then a piece of iron, something like a hockey-stick, is made, and the deity taken into the cattle-shed where he is worshipped by the sacred fire on a Thursday. A he-goat is killed and a few drops of the blood sprinkled on the iron. At the same time cakes are offered and some eaten by one member of the household, but not by more than one or the scourge will not abate, and the rest are buried in the earth. Every fourth year this deity is worshipped after the same fashion. Kailu is, I believe, peculiar to the Gaddis, or at least to Chamba. Early in\n\n(1) When first set up the idol is worshipped with prayers and the sacrifice of a he-goat or sheep. Dhain and khicheri are also placed before it and then eaten by the owner's relatives.\npregnancy the woman puts aside 4 chaklis, (the copper coin of Chamba) with her necklace in the name of Kailu. Two or three months after delivery the parohit, with the woman, worships the demon by putting up a large stone under a walnut or kainth tree, which is sanctified by reciting certain mantras and then worshipped. A white goat, (which may have a black head) is then offered up to the demon, by making an incision in its right ear and sprinkling the blood over a long cloth, 24 yards wide x 9 or 12 yards long, and chaklis and some bread are also offered to the demon.\n\nFinally the woman tastes a piece of gur, and places it on the cloth, which she then wears until it is worn out, when a new one is made and purified in the same way before being worn. The ceremony may be performed at the woman's house, in which case the cloth alone is used as a symbol of the deity. The goat is returned to its owner with the four coins. No other woman may use this sheet, which would cause her divers bodily ills.\n\nPloughing, sowing and reaping should be begun on the lucky days\u2014Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday. If the wheat does not grow on a terraced field the plough is not put on it again that year until a goat has been sacrificed there, and neglect of this rule will result in a death in the family. When new ground is to be broken up the parohit must be asked to name the day and a he-goat sacrificed before the plough is put to it. But instead of this sacrifice, some people take four young girls to the spot and there wash their feet, mark their foreheads with red and give them gur to eat before they begin to plough. And the first fruits of such land are always offered to the deota before being used.\n\nThe godlings associated with chinia, maize, wheat, pulse and barley are Devi, Chaund, Kailung, Kathura N\u00e1g and Sandholu N\u00e1g respectively.\n\nThe chief fairs are seven in number, viz., the Basua on 1st Bais\u00e1kh, the Patroru on 1st Bh\u00e1don, the Sair on 1st Asauj, the Lahori (or Lohri) on 1st M\u00e1gh, and the Dholru on 1st Chet. The dates of the Shibr\u00e1ti (in Ph\u00e1g\u00e1n or varying dates) and of the Holi (in Ph\u00e1g\u00e1n or Chet) vary. The first four festivals are celebrated by games and dances, but there are differences. At the Basua pindiris or flour cakes are eaten with ghi and honey. At the Patroru a cake of a vegetable called siul is eaten: only young girls dance. At the Sair babrus are cooked; and at the Lohri khichri or rice and dal. At the Holi khaddas (parched maize) are eaten, the fire is worshipped at night and a performance called barn held, songs being also sung. At the Dholru again pindiris are eaten, but amusements are rarely allowed. There seems to be no annual feast of the dead. Shiva and the Devis are sacrificed to on a Shibr\u00e1tri.\n\nThe seasons for worship are:\n\nChet, pilgrimages to Bawan and Jaw\u00e1laji in Kangra,\nBh\u00e1don and Asanj, pilgrimages to the shrines of Narsingh, Hari-har, Lakshmi Devi, Ganesh, Kailung\u2014all in Brahmaur; and in Bh\u00e1don only, as a rule, to Mani Mahesha. Shiva is not worshipped at any particular season.\n\nThe low-castes in Brahmaur are chiefly H\u00e1l\u00eds, Kol\u00eds, Loh\u00e1rs and Rihar\u00e1s, with a few Sippis and B\u00e1dh\u00eds. All these are described under Menial castes.\n\nSalutation.\n\nThe Gaddi salutations are as follows:\u2014Among Brahmans, namask\u00e1r; to Brahmans from others, paire pauna, to which they reply asir bachan. R\u00e1jp\u00fats give jai jai to one another and receive it from those beneath them; responding with r\u00e1m r\u00e1m. Khatr\u00eds, Th\u00e1kurs and Rath\u00eds offer lu\u00e1rk\u00ed to one another and receive it from the low-castes, giving in reply r\u00e1m r\u00e1m.\n\nChur\u00e1his is the generic name for the people of Chur\u00e1h(1) who include Br\u00e1hmans, R\u00e1jputs, Th\u00e1kurs, R\u00e1this, and the following low castes:\u2014H\u00e1l\u00eds, Kol\u00eds, S\u00edpp\u00eds, Barw\u00e1l\u00e1s, Loh\u00e1rs, Cham\u00e1rs, Dumnas, Rih\u00e1ras, Meghs, &c. The low castes are all endogamous.\n\nTradition makes the Th\u00e1kurs descendants of the old R\u00e1n\u00e1s (Th\u00e1kurs) or petty chieftains who held Chamba, prior to the foundation of the State by the R\u00e1j\u00e1s, and the Halis, its oldest inhabitants. It also makes the Brahmans immigrants from Brahmaur, and the R\u00e1jputs from the plains; but the R\u00e1this preceded these two castes, having been expelled from the Dugar country by Gugga Chauh\u00e1n\u2014a curious legend.\n\nMarriage is adult, and women are allowed every license before marriage. Three degrees on either side, counting from the grandparents, are avoided, but otherwise there are few restrictions, Brahmans intermarrying with R\u00e1this, by both forms of marriage, and also with R\u00e1jputs and Th\u00e1kurs. Polyandry is not recognized, but polygamy is, and the first or head wife (bari l\u00e1ri) is given Rs. 6 when a second wife is admitted into the house. This fee is called jethw\u00e1gh.\n\nThe observances at betrothal are simple. The initiative is taken by the boy's people, and the binding rite consists in the boy's agents giving one rupee to the girl for ornaments and placing eight Chamb\u00e1 coins, worth nearly 2 annas, in the plates used for entertaining the bride's rub\u00e1rus or representatives.\n\nMarriage is of three kinds.(1) In the superior form called jan\u00e1i the preliminaries are as follows:\u2014Some six months before the wedding the boy's father or brother goes to the girl's house with one or two friends and gives her father Rs. 7 and a goat as his l\u00e1g. A rupee is also given to the bride to buy ornaments, and this is called bandh\u00e1 dena. If the parents agree, an auspicious day is fixed for the wedding, and a day before it two messengers (dh\u00e1mu) from the bride's house come to fetch the boy, who worships the family deva or devi. Next\n\n---\n\n(1) Chur\u00e1h or Chaur\u00e1h is an abbreviation of Chatw\u00e1ha, meaning \"the four roads,\" or Chatw\u00e1ra, \"the four regions.\"\nday, accompanied by a few friends and one of the dh\u00e1mu, he goes to the bride's house. One of the boy's menial H\u00e1li\u015b accompanies him carrying the badh\u00e1i, a present of two m\u00e1nis of grain, to her father. This H\u00e1li\u015b is called putri\u0101r. On his arrival at the entrance the boy worships the kumbh, a vessel full of water; throwing two copper coins into it and then seating himself on a blanket placed near the wall. The bride's sister now has a mimic fight with him and does not let him sit down till he has paid her two annas. This is called bishk. She then fetches the bride and seats her by the boy whose future brother-in-law brings a vessel of boiled rice which he and the boy's brother scatter over the vessel. This is called bhat ching\u00e1na. The pair are then seated, as are the guests, and a feast with songs and dancing follows. Next morning the bride's dowry called su\u00e1j is given to her by her parents. In the afternoon the boy's party returns to his house with two or three of the girl's friends, and the bride herself and other men and women of the bride's party. Before leaving the threshold of the bride's house the ceremony of \u00e1rti is performed, a lighted lamp being waved four times round the head of the pair by a priest, who recites verses from the Sukl\u00e1mb\u00e9r and Deo Lil\u00e1. At the boy's house this observance is repeated, and the kumbh worshipped by the bride and bridegroom, at the door. Then the boy's mother lifts up the bride's veil and presents her with a rupee or half a rupee according to her position. This is called ghundu khar\u00e1 karn\u00e1. After this a feast is eaten and another feast given on the following day, and songs and dances performed. The binding portion of the ceremony is when \u00e1rti is waved round the couple's heads at the boy's house. At his wedding the boy wears a high peaked cap like a Gaddi's, but not a sehra.\n\nWithin a month after the marriage the married pair pay a visit to the wife's parents and make them a small present. This observance is called har-phera.\n\nWidow remarriage is recognised. Formerly the widow was obliged to marry one of the deceased husband's brothers, but now this is not the practice. She can choose her own husband within her own caste or sub-division. This union is solemnized by an inferior form of marriage called sargudhi. There are no dh\u00e1mu, and the bridegroom simply goes to the woman's house with his putri\u0101r and brother. The bandha is given as at a regular wedding, but \u00e1rti is not performed, and there is less feasting and the cost is much less. The binding ceremony in this form is when an ornament is put on her, usually a nose ring.\n\nA quiet form of sargudhi marriage is called gar\u00edb ch\u00e1ra. The l\u00e1g etc., are all rendered as in the other form, but on an auspicious day the bridegroom accompanied by his sister simply goes to the bride's house, and at the entrance worships the kumbh. He then seats himself on the blanket in the usual way, and the girl is seated next him by her mother. After eating the couple take leave of the girl's father and proceed to the boy's house where the kumbh is again touched. This second worship of the kumbh makes the marriage binding.\n\nThe third and lowest form of marriage is the bandh\u00e1 lu\u00e1n\u00e1 in which a widow who is to marry her husband's brother is married to him on the kiria day, i.e., 7th to the 11th or 13th day after the first husband's death. She puts aside her late husband's ornaments and puts on his brother's, in token that she accepts him. A he-goat is sacrificed at home to the deceased husband and a small feast usually given. The widow's parents need not attend,\nbut they are entitled to a *l\u0101g*, called *bakra*, as being the price of a goat. If the widow wishes to marry a stranger, he must pay the *bakra* of one rupee, and Re. 1-8 or Rs. 3 as *chadyoli* to her parents. An auspicious day after the *kiri\u0101 karm* period is ascertained from a *jctshi*, and the ornaments changed as described above.\n\nLastly a man who elopes with a girl can, after a certain interval, open negotiations with her father, and if he assents pay him Rs. 7 and a goat as compensation. This observance is termed *l\u0101g r\u012bt* and operates as a valid marriage.(1)\n\nThe custom of *gharjaw\u0101ntri*, or service in lieu of a money payment for a wife, is common among all castes in the State, especially in the Chur\u0101h and Sadr *wiz\u0101rats*. The term of service is usually three or seven years, and the marriage may take place at any time if the girl\u2019s father is agreeable.\n\nA husband may divorce his wife if he cannot get on with her. The divorce is complete if the husband receives back his ornaments and says: \u201cI have divorced you, *R\u0101ja k\u012b durohi*,\u201d i.e., \u201con the R\u0101j\u012b\u2019s oath.\u201d The husband also breaks a stick in her presence. Divorced wives can remarry if they like.\n\nIn succession all sons, even bastards, if recognized by the father, succeed on equal terms, but the eldest son gets the best field as his *jethw\u0101gh*; the second son gets a special implement, sickle, sword or axe as his *hathi\u0101r*, while the third gets the family house as his *mulw\u0101her*.\n\nThe son (*rand put*) or daughter (*rand dh\u012b\u0101*) of a widow born in her husband\u2019s house has all the rights of her deceased husband\u2019s own children. It is, however, essential that the widow should continue to live in her husband\u2019s house and the child be begotten therein.\n\nAll Hindus except children not yet tonsured are burnt. The head is placed towards the north and the hands on the chest, the face being turned skyward. The Hindu rites are, in essentials, observed, but the place of the *ach\u0101r\u012b* is taken by the Bhat.\n\nFor seven, nine or thirteen days mourning is observed, only one meal a day, called *up\u0101s*, being eaten, and on the day on which mourning is to cease a suit of good woollen clothes (which are prepared beforehand in anticipation of death and worn on festival days) is given to the priest who presides over the obsequies. Sixteen balls of rice are prepared and offered to the deceased\u2019s ancestors and finally removed and thrown into the nearest stream. The relations of the deceased also wash their clothes and a he-goat is killed. Then a feast is given to the relations and the mourning ends. This feast is usually given by the deceased\u2019s wife\u2019s parents. Ceremonies are performed and balls made and offered after one, three and six months, a year and four years, to the deceased. At the latter, i.e., at the end of the fourth year, called *chubarki*, the ceremonial is done on a big scale.\n\n(1) Marriage customs differ considerably in the eastern and western portions of Chur\u0101h, and the above description chiefly applies to the eastern half. In the western half the *byah* or full marriage rite, according to orthodox Hindu custom, is the rule and the *jot\u0101* is uncommon; but the other forms are as above.\nThe obsequies of any man who dies childless are done in the same way, but if he brings any calamity on the household an effigy is made and placed near a spring or on the roof of the house or in some good place and worshipped by offering him a cap, bread, and an earthen pot of ghi which are finally worn and eaten by the man who is supposed to have been affected by him. The spirit of the person who dies a violent death is appeased by taking an earthen pot full of boiled ghi, a pitcher full of water, and a goat to the spot where he met his death, and the goat is killed there and his head and the vessels rolled down the hill. This is done on the paniy\u0101ru, i.e., on the kir\u016b karm day. The caste performs sar\u0101dh. Ceremonies are also performed for the propitiation of ancestors in general.\n\nThe Chur\u0101h\u012bs are zamindars and hold two forms of tenure. Those who give half of the produce of land are called gh\u0101r\u0101s and those who pay a fixed share of grain, etc., are called mudy\u0101ri. The half share is alone divided after deducting the seed for the next crop. Occupancy tenants are not allowed any special privilege in the shape of remission of rent or favourable rates. The Chur\u0101h\u012bs are primarily and essentially zamindars, but many of them own flocks of sheep and goats with which, like the Gaddis, they visit P\u00e1ngi in summer and the low hills in winter.\n\nThe Chur\u0101h\u012bs worship the deities on the following days:\n\n- Shiv\u2014Sunday, Monday and Thursday.\n- Sakti\u2014Sunday, Monday and Tuesday.\n- N\u0101g or Mahal\u2014Thursday and Saturday.\n- Kailu\u2014Thursday.\n- Kyelang\u2014Sunday and Thursday.\n- Sitla\u2014Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday.\n- Chaund\u2014Tuesday, Thursday and Sunday.\n\nTo Shiv are offered a chola or woollen coat, a sheep, charms of silver oblong in shape worn round the neck, a n\u0101di (a silver ornament shaped like a drum). These offerings are taken by the head of the family, and the ornaments are worn by him out of respect for Shiv and to avert his wrath.\n\nTo Sakti Dev\u012b are offered, as elsewhere, a goat, trident and cakes.\n\nThe offerings to a N\u0101g are an iron mace (khanda), a crooked iron stick (kundi) (these are left at the shrine), a sheep and cakes (these are divided among the priest, chela and worshipper, and eaten).\n\nTo Kailu are offered a red cap, an iron mace and a kid. The cap and part of the kid go to the priest, the rest to the worshipper.\n\nKyelang\u2019s offerings are a mace, a goat and a red cap.\n\n---\n\n(1) Men who have died childless are propitiated by putting garlands of flowers and a red woollen cap on their effigies on the Sankrant and Amawus days.\nSitla's offerings are a goat and cakes like the Devi's.\n\nChaund gets cakes, and occasionally a goat is also sacrificed at her shrine.\n\nShiva's temples are called *Shiv ra dera* and Sakti's *Sakti ra dera*, while a N\u00e1g's is styled *N\u00e1g ra dera*.\n\nThe tribe makes a pilgrimage to Mamahesh in Bh\u00e1don or in Asuj, on the Drub Ashtami day.\n\nThe blocks of wood or stone which are supposed to possess some supernatural attributes are worshipped by the tribe.\n\nWhen a deity is to be set up for the first time and consecrated, a Brahman's presence is necessary. The priests preside at shrines; and in dwellings the elder members of the household. Priests are not selected from the Brahman class only, but from all the other castes except low castes. Brahmans, Rajputs, R\u00e1this and Th\u00e1kars are eligible to hold the position of a priest.\n\nThe following are some of the festivals observed in Chur\u00e1h:\n\n1. Bisw\u00e1 on 1st Baisakh at which *pindri* or balls of grain are eaten with honey and *ghi* or *gur*. People also collect together for singing and dancing, this being the Hindu New Year's Day.\n\n2. Patroru ki *sankr\u00e1n* on 1st Bh\u00e1don, held in memory of their ancestors. Flour is mixed with water, salt and spices and spread on *bhujji* leaves, called *patroru*, and eaten.\n\n3. M\u00e1sr\u00fa, held on the same day as the Durbashtami at Mani Mahesh in honour of Shiva\u2014that is, on the eighth day of the light half of Bh\u00e1don. It is accompanied by dancing.\n\n4. Several of the ordinary *melas* observed in the capital, such as Holt, Diw\u00e1li, Lohri, etc., are also held in Chur\u00e1h.\n\n5. *Chhinj*, or wrestling matches associated with the Lakhd\u00e1ta cult are held annually in every *pargana* of Chur\u00e1h.\n\nThe Pangw\u00e1ls are the inhabitants of P\u00e1ngi in the P\u00e1ngi *wizarat* of the State.\n\nThe generic name includes the following high castes:\u2014Brahmans, Rajputs, Th\u00e1kurs and Rathis; and the following low castes:\u2014H\u00e1ll\u00eds, Loh\u00e1rs, Meghs and D\u00e1k\u00eds. There are also a few Tibetans in Pangi, who are called Bhots. The high castes have no restriction either on food or marriage among themselves, but they do not eat or intermarry with the low castes, nor with the Bhots.\n\nThe family traditions of the Pangw\u00e1ls point to their having emigrated from various parts of the hills; some from the lower Chenab and the R\u00e1vi valleys, others from Lahul and Kulu.\nAmong the high castes marriage is prohibited between kinsmen within five degrees on the mother's and ten degrees on the father's side.\n\nThe observances at betrothal are simple. The boy's father, accompanied by a friend, goes to the bride's house and opens negotiations. If the parents consent, the boy's father presents the girl's father with a rupee, an observance called phakhi diti, i.e., \"has given assent.\" The boy's father must go to the girl's house again within a year to confirm the alliance, and this is called chak khani, literally \"to eat food.\" The boy and a friend accompany him and the boy presents the girl with a pair of ear-rings (b\u0101lu) and bracelets (kangan), collectively called bandha. This observance is called bandha dena. To the girl's father he gives Rs. 12, called sidiali, and to her mother Rs. 3, called guami or thitaul. Luchis (cakes wrapped in birch bark) are then distributed to all present, which makes the betrothal binding. If the boy annuls it, he must pay Rs. 6 or more for the girl's man or consent; whereas if the girl annuls it, the boy or his guardian, if he is a minor, can claim unlimited damages. Betrothal may be at any age.\n\nTwo forms of marriage are in vogue. The superior form is called jani or jani, and is carried out as follows in S\u0101ch pargana and as far up as Tindi:\n\nIt is not necessary to ascertain a propitious day for the wedding as it is usual for the boy to go to the girl's house on a Sunday, Tuesday or Thursday; and to bring the bride home on a Monday, Wednesday or Friday. Baisakh, H\u0101r, K\u0101ti, Magh\u0101ir, M\u0101gh and Phagan are auspicious months for marriage. Having secured the girl's father's assent the boy's maternal uncle again goes to the girl's house to get a day fixed for the wedding (shadi), and on that day the wedding party goes to the girl's house, where all are assembled in one room, the bride and the bridegroom being seated next each other, with their maternal uncles at their sides. The girl's maternal uncle then mixes sattu (grain parched and ground) in water. He next makes seven or more lotus or cones, about a cubit high, out of the sattu, rubs butter on them and sticks a flower in each. Then he puts burning charcoal and dhup (incense) in a dhunch (censer) and lights a lamp. Carrying the dhunch in his left hand he takes a little off the top of a totu with his right and touches with it the back of the fire-place(1) to the east, also the sides of the room, to the east, south, west and north, in that order, and the top of the door frame. The girl's maternal uncle then sits down, placing the censer on the ground, while the bride's mother collects the totus, and putting them in a vessel makes as many small flat balls (each with a little hollow on the top) as there are people present. If necessary, she can add more sattu. These balls are given to the guests one by one; her husband pouring a little ghi into the hollows as she does so. Those for the bridal pair are given first by the girl's maternal uncle, and he fixes them on the tips of the fingers of both his hands, crosses his hands and approaches the pair. Whichever first picks and tastes one of the balls, is regarded as the cleverer of the pair. A feast with singing and dancing follows.(2)\n\nNext morning the girl's relations present her with jewelry, utensils, etc., as suaj or dowry. The couple then throw incense into the dhunch, prostrate themselves at their parents' feet, the girl doing so first. This is\n\n---\n\n(1) The fire-place faces north.\n(2) In Kilar and Darw\u0101s parganas no totus are made, but a ball of sattu, honey and ghi is prepared at the bridegroom's house and divided among the guests, a portion being first given to the bridal pair. This observance is called pah\u0101, and is followed by a feast.\ncalled pair bandan. The wedding procession then returns to the boy's home, the boy being carried on the back of the girl's maternal uncle, and vice versa, at the end of the journey, to the entrance, where they alight and walk in. At the door the waina ceremony is performed by the boy's mother passing a sheep three times round their heads. As soon as the couple have crossed the threshold the marriage is complete. But the lotu observance is again gone through, the boy's parents now officiating. A feast is given and another on the following day. The tambol or wedding presents are presented to the bridegroom and the dig, Rs. 12 or more, payable to the girl's father, maternal uncle and own brother, if not already presented, is taken, and next day the guests disperse.\n\nWithin a month the phiranni ceremony takes place. The bride accompanied by her husband goes to her parents' house, taking with them a small present and after remaining a few days they return to their own home.\n\nThe bride is often taken home by her husband after betrothal, without any marriage ceremony. The bridegroom comes to the bride's house and after arranging the matter with the parents, or even without their consent, takes away his wife to his own home. In all such cases the wife, if of age, is of course a consenting party; and if a child, the consent of the parents is essential. A jani is usually held in the bridegroom's house a short time afterwards and tambol is given by his friends but the bride's friends are not present. This custom is now regarded with disfavour, but is still very common in Pangi.\n\nThe inferior form of marriage is called topi lani. It is used in the case of a widow's remarriage, and is only permissible after a year has elapsed since the husband's death. The right to claim the widow's hand rests with the late husband's brothers or nephews, and in the presence of two respectable men the second husband, who should be a brother, nephew, or cousin of the deceased, presents the widow with a new woollen pig-tailed cap. Her acceptance of this cap cements the union. If a stranger wishes to marry the widow, he must obtain her parents' consent and pay a sum of money and may then take her home. This is called randi rakhi lai, and is the only ceremony in this kind of hand-fastening.\n\nWomen are allowed every freedom before marriage, and divorce is fully recognised. There are two forms, one in which the husband pays Rs. 6 to his wife for her man or consent and then breaks a dry stick in two pieces over her head; the other in which he accepts a certain sum for her release from her parents or lover, and then breaks the stick either over the money or her head. The wife cannot then be reclaimed, and is free to marry again, and her children will be regarded as legitimate.\n\nAll legitimate sons succeed equally, but bastards (hallar) have no right of inheritance. Adoption is recognised, and there are no formalities, nor apparently any restrictions, but the presence of a few respectable men as witnesses is required.\n\n---\n\n(1) Man is also used in a third sense. If a man takes a second wife, he usually pays the first wife Rs. 6 as man, to conciliate her, and gives her another rupee to permit the second to visit her husband's room. The first wife generally retains the keys of the house if she has children and is regarded as the head wife. The wives are not given separate houses as is usual in India.\nDeath observances are also simple. Lepers and children under a year old are buried, lying on the back and with their hands folded on the breast and the head to the north. All others are burnt and their ashes thrown into the Chandra Bhaga.\n\nThe pyre (ghi) may be made of any kind of wood, and upon it the body is laid on its left side with the head to the north and face to the east. The shroud, masru, is torn into two pieces from the middle, one piece being placed under and the other over the corpse, and ghi is sprinkled on the wood. The pyre is lighted from each point of the compass by torches, applied first by the son, nephew or sister's son.\n\nFor three or five days after a death only one meal a day (called upda) is eaten by the family of the deceased, then a feast is given to the friends. The date on which the death occurred is observed monthly as a fast, only one meal, also called upda, being eaten. At the end of a year the house is cleansed, a feast is given and the mourning comes to an end. No shraddh is performed, but a small stone slab called pitr with a rough effigy of the deceased cut on it, is set up on the ninth day or later, near a spring or stream. Sometimes a small square hut is erected at a spring and in it is placed an upright piece of wood pitr with the figure of the deceased cut on it, and below this is a spout through which the water flows. This is accompanied by the recitation of mantras, and libations of water offered to the manes of the deceased and is followed by a feast. Those who can afford it erect a long stone slab, called dhaaj, in some place near the village. On the appointed day all the people of the neighbourhood assemble; a sheep is sacrificed over the stone and it is set up in the ground, under the direction of a Brahman, who repeats certain mantras. A feast, called biyau or dlau, is then given, often costing a large sum of money. This is usually done a year or more after the death.\n\nImpurity after a funeral or the birth of a son lasts 12 days, and after that of a girl 9 days. During menstruation a woman is unclean for three days. After child birth or menstruation a woman and the members of her family are purified in the orthodox Hindu manner. On the thirteenth day after a funeral a feast is given to relatives and neighbours, and the family purified as after a birth.\n\nThe only form of tenancy is called adhighari, where half the crop is paid as rent.\n\nThe following are the chief festivals observed in Pangli:\n\n1. Bishu or Bisoa on 1st Baisakh when sanj (small wheaten cakes cooked in ghi), incense, vermillion, flowers, rice, ghi and gur are offered to Devi, and at night relatives and friends are feasted, and luori (a kind of spirituous liquor made from ailo, barley) is freely indulged in.\n\n2. The Uttrain on 1st Magh in honor of their ancestors. Every one who happens to come to the house must be fed, and feasting is common.\n\n3. Shirwati or Shirwich. This is the same as Shivratri and is held in Phagan, as a fast, food being eaten in the evening. Fried suet, milk, ghi and buttermilk (chah) are offered to Shiva and then eaten, to break the fast.\n\n4. The Khaul mela is held on the puranmasi or full moon of Magh. A large lighted torch is carried by the\nhead of each hamlet, and waved before the nearest idol. At night a feast is held and people make small torches called ghaink and swing them round their heads in play, and then throw them at the walnut trees, in the belief that if the torch is caught in the branches the thrower will have a son. At all the melas except Shirwach drunkenness is common.\n\nThe Sil'mela is observed on the new moon of M\u00e2gh or Ph\u00e2gan after the Shiv\u00e2tr\u00ee as a day of rejoicing to mark the advent of spring. The night before they make in every house a totu of sattu with ghi, with a flower on the top. Rising before dawn they worship the family god and other objects in the house, touching them all with the sattu. The younger members of the family do obeisance to the elders. At daybreak they go to the houses of their friends with a bit of sattu and chapatis, and eat and drink with them, repeating the salutation bhala dh\u00e2da (may you be well). Later they visit their friends in more distant villages.\n\nThe Pangw\u00e2ls specially affect Devi, Nag and Shiva worship. The principal Devi temple is at Mindhal, called Mindhal B\u00e2san Devi, and is a place of pilgrimage. Other shrines are those of Mal\u00e2san, S\u00eetla Devi and Det Nag, and such shrines are numerous in the valley. Shiva is worshipped on any day of the week, but specially on Sunday: Devi and Nag on Sunday, Tuesday and Saturday: Siddhs on Friday. Sacrifices consist of a sheep or goat; the animal's head being the perquisite of the slayer, and the rest is divided between the priest and the worshippers. These temples are specially visited on the punya or full moon of Bhadon and Assuj and also in Jeth.\n\nThe Lahulis are the inhabitants of Chamba-Lahul and include Br\u00e2hmans, Rajputs, Th\u00e2kurs and R\u00e2this, with the following low castes:\u2014H\u00e2lis and Loh\u00e2rs. There are also Bhots, but the other castes have no communion with them.\n\nThese castes are all endogamous. The only Rajput families are those of the R\u00e2n\u00e2s of Tilokn\u00e2th and Margr\u00e2on. The former intermarries with the R\u00e2na families in the Ravi valley and Bhattiy\u00e2t: the latter with Th\u00e2kurs and R\u00e2this.\n\nMarriage is prohibited within three degrees of relationship both on the father's and mother's side.\n\nThe marriage customs of the Lahulis are similar to those of P\u00e2ogi. The father of the boy goes to the girl's house accompanied by a friend, and if an alliance is arranged he returns and pays Re. 1 to the father of the girl\u2014called tang-randi.\n\nThere are two forms of marriage, the superior form being called by\u00e2h. They do not consult a Brahman for a lucky day, but Sunday and Monday are regarded as good days.\n\nOn the appointed day the bridegroom goes with his friends to the bride's house. The pair are seated on a carpet alongside each other, the\nbride being on the left, and a totu (cone) of sattu and ghi is prepared and a small portion given them by the bride's maternal uncle, after which it is divided up among the guests. This observance is called marpi. A feast is then given to all present, and in the morning presents in money, jewelry, utensils, &c., are given to the bride, called suaj. The bridegroom also pays one rupee each to the father and mother of the bride. The marriage procession then departs to the bridegroom's home, and at the door the wina ceremony is performed as in Pangi, the sheep being then given to the Hulis. A totu is prepared and divided in the same manner as at the bride's house, and a feast is given. The girl's parents do not accompany the procession, only a brother and other male relatives of the bride to whom nothing is paid on their departure. The custom of taking home the bride after betrothal without a marriage ceremony is also common in Lahul. The phirauni ceremony is the same as in Pangi.\n\nA modified form of polyandry is prevalent in Chamba-Lahul. At the time of the marriage the younger brother of the bridegroom presents one rupee to the bride's mother which establishes his right as a second husband. More than two brothers are not admissible.\n\nWidow remarriage is called topi lani and is practically the same as in Pangi.\n\nDivorce is recognised and usually two or three respectable persons are present on the occasion. The husband and wife hold a piece of thread and break it by pulling in opposite directions. If both are agreeable to the divorce no money payment is made, otherwise the payment is made by the party desiring the divorce and is called man.\n\nThe death observances in Lahul are much the same as in Pangi: children under one year and lepers being buried and all others burnt, and the ashes thrown into the Chandra Bhaga. The funeral ceremony is practically the same as in Pangi, and after it, eight days of mourning are observed, during which only one meal a day is eaten. This meal is called apas. Those who can afford it raise monolith slabs (dhaji) to the dead, but no pilr or wooden figure is set up as in Pangi.\n\nAmong the Lahulis eight days are observed as the period of impurity for all purposes.\n\nThe only tenure in Lahul is called ghai or ghari, i.e., an equal division of the crop between landlord and tenant. Inheritance is the same as in Pangi.\n\nThe Aryan and Mongolian races meet and intermingle in Lahul and the Lahulis exhibit the characteristics of both races, though the Aryan element predominates. Their religion is an impure Buddhism grafted on the ancient and aboriginal Nag and Devi cult, which is similar to that of Pangi and is found as far up the valley as the junction of the Chandra and Bhaga rivers in British Lahul. It is interesting to note, as shown by recent research, that the whole of this tract was Chamba territory from\nthe tenth or eleventh century to about A.D. 1660\u201470, when a part of it passed under the rule of Kulu. Chortens, prayer-wheels, mani, walls, and other symbols of Buddhism are common. The only Buddhist temple is at Triloknath, and the chief Devi shrine is that of Markula Devi at Udaipur.\n\nThere are five principal melas, three of which are held only at Triloknath. The Char or Kun festival takes place at Triloknath, on the amavas, or new moon of Phagan and is meant to represent the departure of winter and the approach of spring. In this festival three masks are used representing a man, a woman and a demon, called in the local dialect gami, mezmi and kulinza. The kulinza mask-bearer represents winter, personified as an evil demon, and is chased by the villagers and pelted with snow balls till he retires from the village and drops his mask, after which he joins in a dance with the gami and mezmi mask-bearers. This mela is the same as the Sil mela in Pangi and has similar observances.\n\nThe Pori festival is in honour of the local Bodhi Sattva called Avalokiteshvara, and takes place on the last day of Sawan at Triloknath. The Ran\u00e1 of Triloknath takes the lead at this mela, which is attended with ancient rites and sacrifices of an aboriginal type and drinking and dancing are common.\n\nThe Brishu and Khau melas are observed throughout Lahul, in the same way as in Pangi.\n\nThe Or mela is held on the full moon of Phagan in Triloknath and Margraon and like all the other melas is accompanied by drinking and dancing. The usual salutation in Lahul is Ru\u00e1r, as in Pangi, and the reply given to the low castes is Ram, Ram.\n\nThe Bhots in Pangi and Lahul intermarry among themselves and have their own marriages and social customs, analogous to those of Pangi, and Lahul respectively.\n\nBhattiyals is a generic name for the people of Bhattiy\u00e1t wizarat, including Brahmins, Rajputs, Th\u00e1kurs, R\u00e1this, with Khatris, Mah\u00e1jans, Kumh\u00e1rs, Jinwars, Nais, Tarkh\u00e1ns, Girths, &c., and the following low castes:\u2014B\u00e1dh\u00e1s, Kolis, Sippis, H\u00e1lis, Cham\u00e1rs, Dumnas, Batw\u00e1ls, Loh\u00e1rs, Dhaugris, Rib\u00e1ras, &c.\n\nCaste restrictions are in full force, and social and marriage customs are much the same as in Kangra, and are in accordance with orthodox Hindu practice.\n\nSome of the Brahmins and Rajputs, especially among the Mians, still adhere to the old prejudice against following the plough, but it is yielding to the force of circumstances.\n\nAll the castes are endogamous, but the Rajputs often take wives from the Th\u00e1kurs, and the Th\u00e1kurs from the R\u00e1this, refusing, however, to give their own daughters in return.\nThere are two forms of marriage of which the superior\u2014the only form among the higher castes\u2014is called by\u0101h. The inferior form, called jhanjar\u0101va, is for widow remarriage only, and is not found among the Br\u0101hma\u1e47a, R\u0101jput, Khatri and Mah\u0101jana castes which do not permit such marriages.\n\nDeath observances and social and religious customs generally, including festivals, are much the same as in Kangra.\n\nThere is no generic name for the people of the Sadr wis\u0101rat, who include representatives of almost all the castes in the State. The marriage and other social and religious customs are not uniform; in the southern portion of the wis\u0101rat they assimilate to those of Brahmans, and in the northern to those of the western portion of Chur\u0101h. In the central portion they are affected by proximity to the capital where caste rules are strictly in force. The by\u0101h or full marriage rite is everywhere customary.\n\nThe following remarks relate to certain castes found throughout the State:\n\nThe Minor High Castes number 7,541 and are chiefly Khatris, Jats, Mah\u0101jans, Kumbhars, Tarkhans and Jinwars with 1,911 Hindu Fakirs. The first three castes differ little from the same castes on the plains. The Khatris and Mah\u0101jans are chiefly shop-keepers; while the Jats and Kumbhars are engaged in farming, but the latter also make pottery. A small number of the Kumbhars are Muhammadans, and some of the Tarkhans are Muhammadans or Sikhs.\n\nThe Menial Castes in the State are numerically important for they include more than one-fourth of the entire population. Their names are for the most part occupational and indicate the low social position which these castes have long occupied. Some of them such as H\u0101lis and Loh\u0101rs are found in all the wis\u0101rats while the Chamr\u0101s, Dumas, Barwals, Kolis, Sippis, B\u0101dhia and Batwals live chiefly in the Sadr, Chur\u0101h and Bhattiy\u0101t wis\u0101rats. The Rib\u0101ras are native to Brahmans and the Ser\u0101ras to the outer hills. Other castes are the Bensis, Dhaugris, Dreins, Meghs, etc.\n\nMost of these castes are indigenous to the hills and probably of aboriginal origin. General Cunningham was of opinion that the Western Hills were originally peopled by a Kolarian group from the same race as the Kols of Central India. The Kolis, Dumas, and Meghs are the only castes having names of an ethnological character; but many of the other castes though now distinguished by purely occupational names may have sprung from the same source as the Kolis. We may safely conclude that the oldest strata among these castes have been settled in the hills from the very earliest times. That they all have in later times received accessions from the high castes, by intermarriage and other connections, hardly admits of any doubt. Their traditions all point to this and indeed such defections are still of frequent occurrence.\nThese castes are all endogamous and conform generally to the marriage and other social and religious customs of the high castes in the different localities in which they happen to reside. A Br\u00e1hman is seldom present at their marriage ceremony which is of a simple character. Betrothal is arranged among them by the payment of a sum of money to the parents of the bride.\n\nOf these castes all but the Chubras burn their dead.\n\nThe B\u00e1dhis (badhna to cut) claim a high social rank and Br\u00e1hmans of the third class are said to attend their marriage rite. They are chiefly carpenters.\n\nThe Jogis too are ambitious of being considered a superior caste. They are chiefly gardeners and farmers and are distinct from the professional ascetics of the same name, though like them many of them have the pierced ear.\n\nThe Hindu Mochis and Sois(1) also claim superior rank and Mandhay\u00e1lu Br\u00e1hmans act as their purohits. The Sois do sewing and make leaf cups.\n\nThe H\u00e1lfis (hal a plough) are the most important of the menial castes, numbering more than one half of the entire community. As a caste name the name is found chiefly in Chamba, but the people are probably identical with the Meghs of Jammu and the D\u00e1kis of Mandi and Kulu. Many of the smaller castes such as Bensis(2) (players), Dhaugris(3) (iron-smelters), Dreins(4) (ferrymen), Loh\u00e1rs (blacksmiths), Reh\u00e1ras(5), &c., are probably offshoots from the H\u00e1lf caste. The H\u00e1lfis are chiefly engaged in farm work and as servants to land-holders. They also hold land from the State, and often subrent it from others paying in cash or kind according to agreement. They also make pattu blankets, remove dead animals and discharge many other menial duties.\n\nThe Cham\u00e1rs (chamr\u00e1 leather) hold land in addition to their hereditary occupation of tanning and working in leather. In the capital most of them are Ramd\u00e1si Sikhs. Their traditions are said to point to migration from the plains and their gotras and als land some support to this.\n\nThe Dumnas are most numerous in the outer hills where they are widely distributed, and are chiefly basket-makers and musicians.\n\nThe Kolis and Sippis are regarded as one caste. They are weavers but also hold and cultivate land. The Kolis must be distinguished from the kohlis who look after the kuhls or irrigation channels and who may be of any caste.\n\n---\n\n(1) Sina\u2014to sew.\n(2) B\u00e1na\u2014a bamboo.\n(3) dhaun\u00e9\u2014to blow.\n(4) Drein\u2014an inflated skin for swimming on.\n(5) The Rih\u00e1ras make brass ornaments called riharn for Gaddi women; the caste name may be derived from the name of the ornaments or vice versa.\nThe Barwals make mats and winnowing fans and also act as musicians. Their name may be derived from baria, the name of the grass used in their work. The Batwals are generally regarded as being of Barwal caste but were formerly employed as chaukidars and peons and this led to their acquiring a slightly higher social status. Many of them are still policemen and peons in Chamb\u00e1. Batwal means tax-collector. A Batwal in the parganas is an ordinary peon under the orders of the pargana officials and may be of any caste.\n\nWhen the members of any of the menial castes subrent land they are called jhumri\u0101lu, i.e., \"family servants,\" but this term is applicable to men of any caste who subrent land from a tenant and not from the State direct.\n\nWhen a man of low caste has brought himself under obligation to a landlord for service in payment of debt he is called k\u0101ma and in former times this was practically a form of slavery. It still exists though not to a large extent and is contrary to the law.\n\nUntil recent times the members of these castes laboured under many vexations restrictions, and indeed were little better than serfs. The men might not wear long hair or live in houses of more than one storey; the women were forbidden to put on gold ornaments, and a bride could not be carried in a palki. At weddings the use of the dafal or drum and the nak\u0101ra or round drum was disallowed. Some of these restrictions still exist, but the social condition of these castes has greatly improved in recent years. The use of the palki, dafal and nak\u0101ra at weddings is still forbidden, but permission may be secured in perpetuity by one payment of Rs. 25 to the State. In all other respects the low castes enjoy all the ordinary rights and privileges of State subjects.\n\nThe form of salutation in use among them is 'Lu\u016brki,' the same as among the Th\u00e1kurs and R\u00e1th\u00eds.\n\nThere are no Chuhras indigenous to the hills, and those in the State are all from the plains, and live in the capital.\n\nMuhammadans are classed under the names of Kashmiri, Jul\u00e1h\u00e1, Mughal, Path\u00e1n, Fak\u00edr, Sheikh and Gujar, the mere mention of which shows whence they came. They number 6,436, and are found chiefly in or near the capital, and in the Chur\u00e1h wiz\u0101rat. The Kashmiris are most numerous, and occupy a special mahalla in the town named after them. The Path\u00e1ns seem to have drifted into the State in search of work, and then settled down as culti-\n\n---\n\n(1) The use of the narsingh or trumpet is allowed only to the high castes.\nThe Jul\u00e1h\u00e1s live chiefly in the suburb of Jul\u00e1khi near the town and have probably been long settled in the State.\n\nThe Gujars are said to be a new importation within the last forty or fifty years and are found with their herds of buffaloes and cows on the slopes of many of the mountain ranges in the R\u00e1v\u00ed Valley. They migrate, as a rule, in spring and autumn between the outer hills and the high ranges, but do not cross the P\u00e1ng\u00ed Range. Each family has its own dh\u00e1r or grazing ground in the mountains to which it always returns. Some have permanently settled in the hills. The Gujars are a fine handsome people with peculiar and characteristic features and dress which make them conspicuous. The men are generally tall and erect, with muscular and well-knit frames. The women are of more slender build, but are active and hard-working. The Gujars make their living by the sale of milk, ghi and other produce. If a market exists near their encampment these are taken in every morning for sale. When they live in the interior of the mountains the milk is made into ghi, and sold to traders who visit them at stated times, by pre-arrangement, to take it over from them. Grazing dues at certain rates are paid by them to the State.\n\nThe principal family in the State is, of course, that of the R\u00e1j\u00e1, of which a full account is to be found in the History of Chamb\u00e1 in the preceding pages. The succession is from father to son. But more than once in recent years, brother has succeeded brother owing to the lack of direct heirs. For instance, the R\u00e1j\u00e1 now on the gaddi, Bhuri Singh, is the younger brother of Sham Singh, who ruled the State till 1904. Bhuri Singh has two sons, the eldest of whom, R\u00e1m Singh, is the heir-apparent. He is about eighteen years of age, and along with his brother, Kes\u00e1ri Singh, is being educated at the Chiefs\u2019 College, Lahore, under the care of an English tutor, who is also giving them a splendid education in field sports of all kinds. The present R\u00e1j\u00e1 is an excellent English scholar. Almost the whole of this Gazetteer has been carefully revised and checked by him; and a great deal of it is actually from his own hand.\n\nA list of the principal J\u00e1g\u00edrd\u00e1rs will be found in Chapter III. Perhaps the most interesting family, next to that of the ruling house, is the Th\u00e1kur family, whose head now rules the j\u00e1g\u00edr of L\u00e1hul. The fact that the heir, Part\u00e1p Chand, and his brother Dhulip Chand, were sent to Chamba for six months of every year to be educated, shows that the general desire for advancement in civilisation has penetrated to that distant corner of the Him\u00e1laya. An account of this family will be found under R\u00e1nds. The following is a list of the remaining principal families, with a description of the title under which they hold their lands and the wizdrats in which the lands are situated. The names in the list are in alphabetical order.\n### List of the principal families in Chamb\u00e1.\n\n| No. | Name | Description | Wiz\u00e1rat |\n|-----|------|-------------|---------|\n| 1   | Mi\u00e1n Anirudh Singh, Bijlw\u00e1n | J\u00e1gird\u00e1r | Sadar. |\n| 2   | Mi\u00e1n Budhi Singh, Chaub\u00e1ria | Do. | Do. |\n| 3   | Jyotsh\u00ed Chandar Mani, R\u00e1j\u00e1-jyotsh\u00ed | Do. | Do. |\n| 4   | Mi\u00e1n Gaja Singh, Jasrotia | Do. | Do. |\n| 5   | Mi\u00e1n Gobind Singh, Jindrotia | Do. | Do. |\n| 6   | Mi\u00e1n Jodh Singh, Behandril | Do. | Chur\u00e1h. |\n| 7   | Mi\u00e1n Kart\u00e1r Singh, Chamb\u00edal | Do. | Do. |\n| 8   | Mi\u00e1n Kharak Singh, Bhupatia | Do. | Do. |\n| 9   | Pandit Mohan L\u00e1l, R\u00e1j\u00e1-guru | Do. | Do. |\n| 10  | Mi\u00e1n Moti Singh, Bijlw\u00e1n | Do. | Do. |\n| 11  | Mi\u00e1n Partap Singh, Chamb\u00edal | Do. | Bhattiy\u00e1t. |\n| 12  | Kh\u00e1lawa R\u00e1m D\u00e1s, Barstru | Do. | Sadar. |\n| 13  | Dr. Chatar Bhnj, R\u00e1j\u00e1-va\u00edd | S\u00e1sand\u00e1r | Bhattiy\u00e1t. |\n| 14  | Porohit Mansa R\u00e1m, R\u00e1j\u00e1-porohit | Do. | Sadar. |\n| 15  | Mehta Trilokn\u00e1th, Bagalw\u00e1n | Do. | Do. |\n| 16  | Lala Gurditta Mal, Sethi | Muafid\u00e1r | Bhattiy\u00e1t. |\n| 17  | Mi\u00e1n Jiwan Singh, Kotlia | Do. | Sadar. |\n| 18  | Mi\u00e1n Day\u00e1la, Kudi\u00e1l | M\u00e1lguz\u00e1r | Bhattiy\u00e1t. |\n| 19  | Mi\u00e1n D\u00e1s, Jathrunia | Do. | Do. |\n| 20  | Mi\u00e1n Hoshy\u00e1r Singh, Jindrotia | Do. | Do. |\n| 21  | Lala Jai Day\u00e1l, Baratr\u00fa | Do. | Do. |\n| 22  | Lala Jalya R\u00e1m, M\u00e1hir | Do. | Do. |\n| 23  | Mi\u00e1n Jant, Nari\u00e1l | Do. | Do. |\n| 24  | Mi\u00e1n Moti Singh, Katcoch | Do. | Do. |\n| 25  | Baksh\u00ed Prabh Day\u00e1l, Nijjar | Do. | Do. |\n| 26  | Sirdar Gop\u00e1l D\u00e1s, Gh\u00e1m\u00e1n | Do. | Do. |\n| 27  | Lala R\u00e1m D\u00e1s, Lahri\u00e1l | Do. | Do. |\n| 28  | Mi\u00e1n Sohan Singh, Chen\u00e1ria | Do. | Sadar. |\n| 29  | Mi\u00e1n Sahib Singh, Banpatia | Do. | Bhattiy\u00e1t. |\n| 30  | Mi\u00e1n T\u00e1r\u00e1, Parwaiw\u00e1la | Do. | Do. |\n\nMi\u00e1n Anirudh Singh, Bijlw\u00e1n, is from an ancestor named Jit Singh, second son of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Ganesh Varma (A.D. 1512\u201459). His sons were Bijl Singh, Ranpat Singh, Jaghat Singh, and Bhupat Singh, from whom respectively are descended the Bijlw\u00e1n, Ranpatia, Jaghatia and Bhupatia branches of the ruling family. Bijl Singh had two sons, Pah\u00e1r Singh, the ancestor of Mi\u00e1n Anirudh Singh, and Mal\u00e1g\u00e1r, the ancestor of the late Mi\u00e1n Moti Singh, Bijlw\u00e1n. As the latter died without male issue and the succession to his j\u00e1gir is still unsettled his name is retained on the list of families, pending the decision.\n\nMi\u00e1n Budhi Singh, B\u00e1g\u00e1wala, is the head of the Chaub\u00e1ria family, of which the parent stem is now extinct. He is descended from Shakat Singh, a younger son of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Prithvi Singh (A.D. 1641\u201464). The \u00e1l or family name is from the Chaub\u00e1ra mahalla in the capital, and the B\u00e1g\u00e1wala branch is so named from the original residence having been in a garden near the palace.\n\nJyotsh\u00ed Chandar Mani, R\u00e1j\u00e1-jyotsh\u00ed, is descended from an ancestor named Pr\u00e1b\u00e1kar, who was appointed to the office of R\u00e1j\u00e1-jyotsh\u00ed, or astrologer to the Court, probably by R\u00e1j\u00e1 Ganesh Varma (A.D. 1512\u201459). This office has remained in the family ever since.\n\n---\n\n(1) The duties of the R\u00e1j\u00e1-jyotsh\u00ed are as follows:\u2014He prepares a yearly astrological almanac; calculates eclipses; makes an annual list of ceremonial observances for the R\u00e1j\u00e1; records the birth and prepares the horoscope of a prince; gives dates for bringing him out to see the sun and moon, cutting the first hair; and investing him with the jange; also for marriages and resuming the wearing of ornaments after the time of mourning.\nMi\u00e1n Gaja Singh, Jasrotin, is descended from R\u00e1j\u00e1 Sukh Deo of Jasrota. His ancestor, Basant Singh, was expelled in a family quarrel and came to Chamba in the reign of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Ajit Singh (A.D. 1794\u20141808), and received the j\u00e1gir in Mahla still held by the family.\n\nMi\u00e1n Gobind Singh, Jindrotia, is a scion of the Balauria royal clan, the former rulers of Basohli: and his family name is derived from the village of Jindrot in Basohli. Surat Singh, his great-great-grandfather, came to Chamba in the reign of R\u00e1j\u00e1 R\u00e1j Singh (A.D. 1764\u201494) and fell in battle with that R\u00e1j\u00e1 at Nerti. Aut\u00e1r Singh, his grandfather, was Wazir of Chamba from 1873 to 1878.\n\nMi\u00e1n Hoshy\u00e1r Singh, Jindrotia, is a son of Mi\u00e1n B\u00eer Bhadar, younger brother of Wazir Aut\u00e1r Singh.\n\nMi\u00e1n Jodh Singh, Behandr\u00e1l, is a scion of the former ruling family of Behandr\u00e1lta or R\u00e1mnagar, in Jammu\u2014the oldest existing branch of the Chamba ruling family. Some six or seven generations ago his ancestor, a grandson of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Inder Deo, came to Chamba and received a j\u00e1gir at Bagai which is still in the possession of the family.\n\nMi\u00e1n Kart\u00e1r Singh, Chamb\u00ed\u00e1l, is a great-grandson of Zor\u00e1war Singh, younger brother of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Charat Singh (A.D. 1808\u201444). He receives a cash payment in lieu of a j\u00e1gir.\n\nMi\u00e1n Kharak Singh, Bhupatia, is descended from Bhupat Singh, grandson of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Ganesh Varma, (vide Bijlw\u00e1n family).\n\nPandit Mohan L\u00e1l, R\u00e1j\u00e1-guru, traces his descent from an ancestor named Suranand, who came from Benares and was made R\u00e1j\u00e1-guru, or spiritual preceptor to the Court, by R\u00e1j\u00e1 Ganesh Varma. This office is hereditary in the family. Pandit Mohan L\u00e1l holds the office of Civil Judge and his brother Pandit Narsingh Day\u00e1l acts as R\u00e1j\u00e1-guru.\n\nMi\u00e1n Part\u00e1p Singh, Chamb\u00ed\u00e1l, is half-brother to the present R\u00e1j\u00e1, and was born after his father\u2019s abdication.\n\nKhaliwa R\u00e1m D\u00e1s, Baratru, is descended from an ancestor named Jat\u00e1r who came to Chamba from Baratar in Nurpur. His grandsons were Jagat R\u00e1m and Meru. The former was the head of the family in the time of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Ummed Singh (A.D. 1748\u201464), and was with the R\u00e1j\u00e1 during his imprisonment in Lahore (see p. 97). After returning to Chamb\u00e1 Jagat R\u00e1m was appointed Kh\u00e1l\u00e1wa, or lord chamberlain, on the birth of R\u00e1j Singh, and this office has ever since been hereditary in the family. Vijaya R\u00e1m, grandson of Jagat R\u00e1m, was Kh\u00e1l\u00e1wa to R\u00e1j\u00e1 Ajit Singh, and his sons were Magna and Bh\u00e1ga. Magna retained office till 1867 and was succeeded by Kh\u00e1l\u00e1wa R\u00e1m D\u00e1s, whose son, Captain Sri Kanth, is in command of the State troops. His second son, Karm Singh, is a Judge. R\u00e1m D\u00e1s is also Wazir or Manager of the Lakshmi N\u00e1r\u00e1yan temple and its revenues.\n\n(1) The duties of the R\u00e1j\u00e1-guru are as follows:\u2014He has charge of the royal bannals or genealogical roll; directs the R\u00e1j\u00e1-prophet in the religious rites at births, marriages and deaths; acts as first teacher to a young prince, and officiates in the religious ceremony at the installation of a R\u00e1j\u00e1.\nSeveral members of this family have rendered distinguished service to the State in the past. In the reign of R\u00e1j\u00e1 R\u00e1j Singh, when Chamb\u00e1 was invaded by Basohli (see p. 99), Zor\u00e1war, son of Meru, above mentioned, was Wazir of the State, and commanded the army which, with the help of the Sikhs, drove out the invaders. On his death the office of Wazir was conferred on his younger brother Nathu, who retained it for more than 40 years. He commanded the contingent sent in 1806 to help the Ghurkhas against Sans\u00e1r Chand of Kangra (vide p. 103). He is said to have enjoyed the special favour of Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja Ranjit Singh, owing to his fidelity during the first invasion of Kashmir in 1814. On the defeat of the Sikhs the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja was for a time in some danger of being captured, and was enabled to escape by having Nathu's palki placed at his disposal. This service he never forgot, and the influence which Nathu thus gained was on several occasions made use of to the advantage of the State. Indeed, there can be little doubt that but for Nathu's influence Chamba would have shared the fate of most of the other hill principalities. It was Nathu, too, who conquered Bhadraw\u00e1h and obtained from Ranjit Singh the sanad which afterwards was the means of preserving the State from annexation to Jammu.\n\nOn his death in 1838 Nathu was succeeded by Bh\u00e1ga, younger brother of Magna who was then Khal\u00e1wa. In 1846, Bh\u00e1ga by his prompt and patriotic action saved the State from becoming subject to Jammu. On his retirement in 1854 Bh\u00e1ga was followed in the office of Wazir by Billu, grandson of Toka, who was younger brother to Vijaya R\u00e1m, and he retained office till 1860. His son is L\u00e1l\u00e1 Jai Day\u00e1l, Baratru, Judge of the Small Cause Court.\n\nDr. Chatar Bhuj, R\u00e1j\u00e1-vaid, is the head of a Vaid Brahman family long resident in Chamb\u00e1. In the reign of R\u00e1j\u00e1 R\u00e1j Singh the ancestor of the family named Premji emigrated to Jammu, where he acquired a knowledge of the Yun\u00e1ni system of medicine, and was afterwards recalled to Chamb\u00e1 and appointed R\u00e1j\u00e1-vaid, or physician to the Court. The letters of recall and appointment are still in the possession of the family. From that time the office became hereditary and Dr. Chatar Bhuj, who was educated at the Lahore Medical School, has acted as Court-physician since 1884.\n\nPurohit Mansa R\u00e1m, R\u00e1j\u00e1-purohit, is descended from an ancestor named Tribho who was R\u00e1j\u00e1-purohit, or family priest to the Court, in the time of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Ganesh Varma (A.D. 1512\u201459), an office held by members of the family ever since.\n\nMehta Trilokn\u00e1th, Bagalw\u00e1n, being a minor is a ward of the State. The family name is from Bagala, a village in Ujain from whence Jan\u00e1rdan, the ancestor of the family, came. His son Chunu received a s\u00e1san grant from R\u00e1j\u00e1 Udai Singh (A.D. 1690\u20141720).\n\n(1) The R\u00e1j\u00e1-purohit is a family priest under the R\u00e1j\u00e1-guru, and carries out all ceremonial observances in accordance with the latter's instructions.\nL\u00e1l\u00e1 Gurditta Mal, Sethi, is the head of a family which came from Sialkot three generations ago. He holds the office of Postmaster-General.\n\nMi\u00e1n Jiwan Singh, Kotlia, is the head of a branch of the Jasrota family, and his ancestor, Khush\u00e1l Singh, came to Chamb\u00e1 in the reign of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Ummed Singh (A.D. 1748\u201464). The family name is from Kotli, a place in Jasrota, which was the original j\u00e1g\u00edr of the family.\n\nMi\u00e1n T\u00e1r\u00e1, Parw\u00e1iw\u00e1la, is descended from R\u00e1j\u00e1 Dalel Singh, (A.D. 1785\u201448), and the al is from the village of Parw\u00e1\u00ed in Chu\u00e1ri\u00ed pargana, which is the family residence. No j\u00e1g\u00edr is now held by this branch.\n\nMi\u00e1n Day\u00e1la, Kudi\u00e1l, claims descent from Jai Singh, second son of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Prithvi Singh. The al is from Kud, a village in Hub\u00e1r pargana, but the family now resides at G\u00e1lur\u00e1 in Chu\u00e1ri\u00ed pargana. The Jathrunia family is of the same origin as the Kudi\u00e1l and the al is from Jathrun in the Chu\u00e1ri\u00ed pargana.\n\nMi\u00e1n Jant, Nari\u00e1l, is the head of this branch of the ruling family of which the descent is also from Jai Singh. The al is from the village of N\u00e1l in Chu\u00e1ri\u00ed pargana.\n\nL\u00e1l\u00e1 Jalya R\u00e1m, M\u00e1hir, is the grandson of Sheru, the first member of this family to come into prominence, who was Vakil or Agent of the State in Dalhousie. The al is a caste name.\n\nMi\u00e1n Moti Singh, Katoch, the Kotw\u00e1l or Chief Constable of the State, is descended from the youngest brother of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Bhim Chand of Kangra (A.D. 1687). His father, Mi\u00e1n Hosh\u00fd\u00e1r Singh, was Kotw\u00e1l from 1883 to 1903, and his grandfather, Mi\u00e1n Gaunda Singh, who was the first of the family to come to Chamb\u00e1, was Waz\u00edr from 1878 to 1884.\n\nBakhshi Prabh Day\u00e1l, Nijjar, is the Chief Revenue Officer. He came from Rihlu in Kangra.\n\nSird\u00e1r Gop\u00e1l D\u00e1s, Gham\u00e1n, is Superintendent of Works. The family came from Gham\u00e1n in Gurdaspur.\n\nL\u00e1l\u00e1 R\u00e1m D\u00e1s, Lahri\u00e1l, is the head of the Lahri\u00e1l family. The al is from L\u00e1hra, a village in Bhatti-Tikri pargana, the site of the family lands. The ancestor of the family came from Ujain. In the reign of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Ummed Singh (A.D. 1748\u201464) the head of the family was appointed Kotw\u00e1l and the office remained in the family for five generations. Sibbu, father of R\u00e1m Das, held office for 50 years, dying in 1879. He was succeeded by his brother, Phonchu, but on the latter's death in 1888 the office passed away from the family.\n\nMi\u00e1n Sohan Singh, Chen\u00e1ria, traces his descent from Bishambar, a younger son of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Bhala Bhadran, who was killed at Dhalog (A.D. 1623) in the war with Jagat Sing\nof Nurpur. The al or family name is derived from a chen\u00e1r tree that stood near the original home, which was cleared away to make room for the Residency. The family does not now own any j\u00e1gir, having lost it in the reign of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Sri Singh. The Falgutia branch is an offshoot of the Chen\u00e1ria, and the name is from Falgut, a village in R\u00e1jnagar pargana.\n\nMi\u00e1n Sahib Singh, Ranpatia, of Gun in the Lil pargana, is descended from R\u00e1j\u00e1 Ganesh Varma. (Vide Bijlw\u00e1n family). This family does not now own any j\u00e1gir, having lost it during the reign of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Sri Singh.\n\nThe Jaghatia branch of the ruling family (vide Bijlw\u00e1n family), though still in existence, is not now resident in the State.\n\nThe following may also be mentioned as representing leading families in the State:\n\nLehna Singh, Guleria, Mothila.\nThakur D\u00e1s, Mothl\u00e1l, Raipur.\nNikka, Jari\u00e1l, Tundi.\nSingh\u00fa, Sihuntia, Sihunt\u00e1.\n\nMi\u00e1n Jaswant Singh, Bhadw\u00e1l, Chun.\nMi\u00e1n Kad\u00e1ra, Bhadw\u00e1l, Chun\u00e1ri.\nMi\u00e1n Aut\u00e1r Singh, Kashtw\u00e1ria, Himgari.\nMi\u00e1n Mohr Singh, Jasrotia, Panjila.\n\nIn accordance with ancient custom all the J\u00e1g\u00edrd\u00e1rs are under obligation for personal service in the R\u00e1ja\u2019s bodyguard; but in recent years the privilege has been granted of commuting this service into a money payment, called ghori\u00e1na, at the pleasure of the j\u00e1g\u00edrd\u00e1r.\n\nAmong the most interesting families in the State are the descendants of the R\u00e1n\u00e1s (1) and Th\u00e1kurs, who ruled the country before the advent of the R\u00e1j\u00e1s (vide pages 60\u201463). Much valuable information has recently come to light regarding these ancient rulers of the hills, chiefly through the researches of Dr. Vogel of the Archaeological Department. In the slab inscriptions and copper-plates they are usually indicated by the name r\u00e1j\u00e1naka, and referring to the origin of this word Dr. Vogel says:\n\n\"This word is not found in the classical literature of India, and seems, therefore, to be a sanskritized rather than a true Sanskrit word. Dr. Grierson has suggested a connection between this word and the Prakrit title r\u00e1jana (i.e., r\u00e1janna = skr. r\u00e1janya) which occurs on coins. To me it seems more probable that the word r\u00e1n\u00e1 is derived directly from r\u00e1jan. Perhaps it is the oblique case of this word transferred to the nominative. In any case there can be little doubt that the word corresponds with the modern r\u00e1n\u00e1, used either as the title of a petty chief or as a caste-name. In the former meaning it is synonymous with Sanskrit s\u00e1manta and th\u00e1kura. In one of our inscriptions (No. 32) we find the terms r\u00e1j\u00e1naka and s\u00e1manta applied to the same person. The word th\u00e1kura occurs in the form th\u00e1kura in the Markula image inscription (No. 48). It is not found elsewhere in the Chamba epigraphs, but in the R\u00e1j\u00e1-tarangini it is used in exactly the same sense as r\u00e1j\u00e1naka, to denote a feudal chieftain. I may add that nowadays the titles r\u00e1n\u00e1 and th\u00e1kur are employed promiscuously.\"\n\nIt is probable, however, that in former times, as at the present day, the two names implied a difference of caste, the\n\n(1) The barony of a R\u00e1n\u00e1 was called ranhu, and of a Th\u00e1kur, th\u00e1kuri; and the period during which the R\u00e1n\u00e1s and Th\u00e1kurs ruled is spoken of as ranh\u00fa and th\u00e1kuri or thakurain.\nr\u0101n\u0101s being of the warrior caste and the th\u0101kurs of the Th\u00e1kur or R\u00e1thi caste. The R\u00e1n\u00e1s seem to have been most numerous in some parts of the hills and the Th\u00e1kurs in others. In Chamb\u00e1, Bhadraw\u00e1h, P\u00e1dar and P\u00e1ngi, for example, almost all the old rulers seem to have been r\u0101n\u0101s. In the lower Chandrabh\u00e1gga Valley, on the other hand, the name r\u0101n\u0101 is little known, and the ancient rulers, who are several times referred to in the R\u00e1jatarangini, bore the title of th\u0101kur. In Kulu and L\u00e1hul also the title th\u0101kur was most common, though there were also r\u0101n\u0101s in both of these tracts. A good many R\u00e1n\u0101 families are still to be found in K\u00e1ngra, where their ancestors seem to have held rule in former times. Mr. Barnes makes the following remarks regarding them:\u2014\u201cAnother class of R\u00e1jputs who enjoy great distinction in the hills are the descendants of ancient petty chiefs or r\u0101n\u0101s, whose title and tenure is said to have preceded that of the R\u00e1j\u00e1s themselves. These petty chiefs have long since been dispossessed and their holdings absorbed in the larger principalities, still the name of r\u0101n\u0101 is retained and their alliance is eagerly desired by the Mians.\u201d\n\nTo the R\u00e1n\u00e1s we are indebted for most of the beautifully carved cisterns and slab inscriptions so common in the State, a full account of which will be found in the Antiquities of Chamb\u00e1, Vol. I, by J. Ph. Vogel, Ph. D., Superintendent, Archaeological Survey of India. These inscriptions convey to us a favourable impression of the ancient chiefs. Referring to them Dr. Vogel says:\n\n\u201cNo doubt, like the knights of medi\u00e6val Europe, they regarded love and war as the great aims of life. But their love was often the devotion of the husband, and their warlike spirit was not rarely displayed in loyal service to their liege-lord. Of the conjugal devotion of these warlike barons we have ample proof in these quaint fountain slabs, which they set up for the sake of the future bliss of their deceased wives. And we find it expressed even more clearly in the solemn Sanskrit of those eulogies where, hidden under the weight of rhetorical ornament, we still feel the pulsations of true love. Would it be just to cast on the hero of the Sar\u00e1han eulogy, the reproach that his love for the beauteous Somaprabha was inspired merely by her fair form, the beauty of which is sung in such glowing measures, in that love-song carved in stone? Did he not prove its sincerity when, to establish a firm friendship between her and the mountain-born goddess (P\u00e1rvati), he built a temple to the moon-crowned Shiva.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the half-obliterated lines of the Mul-kih\u00e1r stone we still read of the tears shed by the chieftain of that place and his children, when \u2018hostile fate separated her, his most beloved, seated on his lap, the delight of his eyes and praised by all mankind from her husband, even as the passing of the parvan separates the Moon-sickle from the hot-rayed Sun\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe no less sadly damaged eulogy of Devikothi speaks of yet another love that of a noble lady who, at her husband\u2019s death being ready to follow him on the pyre, was kept back by her two sons, and who \u2018henceforth, whilst by rigid vows of constant fasts she reduced her body to meagreness, brought up her sons and increased her charity, her compassion for the poor and her devotion to Krishna. And at every step conceiving the world of the living to be unstable, like the crescent reflected in a garland of waves,\u201d\nrestless and trembling with the fleeting breeze, she caused a cistern to be made for the sake of the bliss of her lord.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know of no Indian inscriptions in which true human sentiment finds so eloquent an expression as in those two, alas, irreparably mutilated fountain slabs; nor would it be easy to point to another group of epigraphical records in which the feminine element is so prominent as in those of Chamb\u0101.\u201d\n\nIn their relations with one another the R\u00e1n\u00e1s appear in a much less favourable light. By each of them his next neighbours seem to have been regarded as natural enemies, with whom the only possible relationship was one of mortal feud. When not opposing a common foe they were engaged in oppressing and despoiling one another, and in the memory of the hillmen they are associated only with dissension and strife. Numerous incidents of those stirring times have been handed down by local tradition, and are treasured in the folklore of the people. One of them is worth recording. In Loh-Tikri there resided two r\u00e1n\u00e1s at the neighbouring villages of B\u00e1hnota and Siya, who were at continual feud with each other. At length the less powerful, being weary of the harassing treatment to which he was subjected, entered into a compact with a third r\u00e1n\u00e1, who promised to come to his help on hearing the alarm-horn. Soon afterwards the signal was given and the new ally hastened to the spot to find that the horn had been sounded only to test his fidelity. The result was that when next the alarm was heard, at a time of real need, it was disregarded, and the weaker r\u00e1n\u00e1 had to submit to any humiliation his powerful neighbour chose to inflict on him.\n\nThere is hardly a locality in the State where the villagers cannot recall the place of residence of the local r\u00e1n\u00e1, and they can often point out the very site on which his house or fort formerly stood. In some cases, as at Mulkih\u00e1r and Devi Kothi, the ruins are still visible, and in others, as at Kothi-ranhu, Sutker and Deol, the ancient buildings are, or till recently, were in actual use. It also seems probable that as in Kuln,\u00b9 some of the parganas of the State may have preserved their present boundaries since the time when each of them formed the domain of a r\u00e1n\u00e1.\n\nThe baronies owned by these petty chiefs were always of small extent and can have had in them few of the elements of stability and permanence. That in some parts of the hills they acknowledged the supremacy of some paramount power seems probable, but that in others, especially in the olden time, they were free and independent rulers is fully borne out by local tradition, and the negative evidence of some of the slab inscriptions. In the upper R\u00e1vi Valley they lost their independence at a very early period, for we have the record of a feudatory chief, named Ash\u00e1dha of Gun, as early as the reign of Meru Varma (A.D. 680\u2014700) whose s\u00e1manla or vassal he styles himself. In the lower R\u00e1vi Valley and P\u00e1ngi they were probably independent down\n\n\u00b9) Vide page 62.\nto the tenth or eleventh century. The Th\u00e1kurs of L\u00e1hul were in ancient times subject to Tibet or Lad\u00e1kh, but in the tenth or eleventh century those of the main Chandrabh\u00e1ga Valley came under the control of Chamba. In Pad\u00e1r the R\u00e1n\u00e1s ruled the country till the seventeenth century, but it is probable that, from the twelfth century, they were dependent on Chamba. The Th\u00e1kurs of the lower Chandrabh\u00e1ga Valley retained their independence till a date later than the tenth century, when the Kashtw\u00e1r State was founded: while the R\u00e1n\u00e1s of Bhadraw\u00e1h seem to have been in power down to the sixteenth century, though possibly subject to Bala\u00far.\n\nThe R\u00e1n\u00e1s and Th\u00e1kurs of Kulu are referred to in the earliest records of that State, which was founded not later than the third or fourth Christian century. Frequent references to them also occur in the later history down to the reign of R\u00e1ja Bah\u00e1dur Singh, A.D. 1559, by whom most of them were finally subjected.\n\nThe earliest known inscription in Chamb\u00e1 in which the title r\u00e1j\u00e1naka occurs is on the base of a stone Devi image at Svaim in the Himgari pargana, and it records that the image was made by the order of R\u00e1j\u00e1naka Bhogata, son of Somata, born in the district of Kishkindha. It is not dated, but judging from the characters it must belong to the eighth or ninth century. Neither in this inscription nor in that of Sar\u00e1han of the tenth century, already referred to, is any mention made of an overlord, from which we may conclude that these r\u00e1n\u00e1s were independent rulers. On the other hand, the r\u00e1n\u00e1s of Chur\u00e1h and Pangi, in the twelfth century, dated their inscriptions in the regnal year of the ruling R\u00e1j\u00e1. For several centuries after their subjection the R\u00e1n\u00e1s continued to rank as feudal barons under the ruling chiefs, and the copper-plates of the tenth, eleventh and twelfth centuries clearly prove that they then held a prominent position in the State. They are mentioned immediately after the R\u00e1j\u00e1 in the order of precedence, and at the head of all the State officials. In the reign of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Soma Varma (A.D. 1060\u201480) two R\u00e1n\u00e1s\u2014Rihila and Kahila by name\u2014filled, respectively, the important offices of Prime Minister and Lord Chancellor. On the fountain slabs the R\u00e1n\u00e1s are rudely depicted as knights on horseback, armed with sword and shield, and as feudal barons each of them had his own retainers with whom he accompanied his lord-superior, the R\u00e1j\u00e1, on military expeditions. In this relationship we see a close analogy to the feudal system of medi\u00e6val Europe.\n\nThe title 'R\u00e1j\u00e1naka' seems originally to have been held only by the ancient petty chiefs, but in later times the R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Kashmir, Chamba, and probably other States, were in the habit of conferring it on some of their officers, as a personal distinction for special services. The title was probably given along with a j\u00e1gir or grant of land.\nSeveral instances are found in the R\u00e1ja-tarangini in which the title was so conferred, and Dr. Stein in referring to them says:\n\n\"The title R\u00e1j\u00e1naka, meaning literally 'almost a king', used to be given for services rendered to the King. The title has survived in the form R\u00e1zd\u00e1n as a family name of very frequent occurrence among the Brahmins of Kashmir. As the designation of certain high officers (Muhammadans) the term R\u00e1j\u00e1naka is often used by Shrivara and in the fourth Chronicle. The title was also known in Trigarta or Kangra\".(1) On a slab inscription lately found in Chamba a specific instance is given in which the title R\u00e1j\u00e1naka was conferred by R\u00e1ja Lalita Varma (A.D. 1143\u201470) on a land-holder, named N\u00e1gap\u00e1la, who lived near Debri Kothi in Chur\u00e1h. This use of the title was probably in vogue from the time of the Rajput conquest, and a tradition exists in the families of three of the R\u00e1n\u00e1s in the upper R\u00e1vi Valley\u2014Ul\u00e1sna, Gurola, and Suai\u2014that their common ancestor came back from Kulu with R\u00e1j\u00e1 Mushan Varma (A.D. 820\u201440), when he recovered his territory from the Kira invaders (vide page 72), and received his title along with a j\u00e1gir for services rendered on that occasion and in the conquest of the R\u00e1vi Valley. It may be noted that during Mughal rule, and probably from a much earlier period, an analogous use prevailed of the title 'R\u00e1j\u00e1', which was often conferred as a personal distinction\u2014and this use still exists under British rule. Of the R\u00e1n\u00e1s in the Chamb\u00e1 State at the present time it is impossible to say how many are descended from titular r\u00e1n\u00e1s and how many from the early rulers of the hills, but many of them are unquestionably of ancient lineage. Few now hold j\u00e1girs or exercise any authority, most of them being common farmers, but it is probable that in almost every instance their holdings are a portion of the old family lands.\n\nThe references to the R\u00e1n\u00e1s on the older plates and slab inscriptions show that up till the middle of the twelfth century they had lost nothing of their former prestige. Till then, indeed, it seems to have been the policy of the R\u00e1jas to retain their allegiance by giving them high positions at the Court and in the administration. After this a break occurs in the continuity of our records and when the narrative is resumed by the later plates, beginning with that of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Vair\u00e1si Varma (A.D. 1330), all references to the R\u00e1n\u00e1s have ceased. There is reason to believe that from this period they began to decline in influence, and to lapse into the condition of obscurity in which we now find them. The question arises as to the causes which brought about their downfall, and the history of a similar class of feudal barons in Kashmir may perhaps suggest an answer. From the R\u00e1ja-tarangini we learn that in the beginning of the twelfth century the D\u00e1maras\u2014who were the great land-holders in Kashmir, and held\n\n(1) R\u00e1ja-tarang (Stein) VI, 117. Vol. I, page 244, footnote, Raj-tarang, Vol. II, pages 304\u20148.\nthe same social and political position as the R\u00e1n\u00e1s and Th\u00e1kurs in Chamb\u00e1\u2014had acquired, during a long succession of weak reigns, so much power as to have become a menace to the ruling house. King Harsha (A.D. 1089-1101) therefore determined on their destruction, and many of them were accordingly massacred. This procedure, however, entirely failed of its object and only resulted in a successful revolt which cost Harsha his throne and his life. The succeeding reigns furnish a record of almost continuous strife between the central authorities and the D\u00e1maras or between the various factions of the D\u00e1maras themselves.\n\nThere is hardly a State in the hills which does not possess traditions of a similar conflict between the feudatory chiefs and their liege-lords\u2014the R\u00e1j\u00e1s; forcibly reminding us of the long struggle of the monarchs of medi\u00e6val Europe with their powerful barons.\n\nObscure traditions of a similar state of things exist in Chamb\u00e1 and it seems probable that there too the R\u00e1n\u00e1s were a source of danger, and safety was assured by their complete subjection. That some of them were almost independent of the central authority may be conjectured from the wording of some of the slab inscriptions; and local tradition has handed down many interesting and significant incidents which confirm this conjecture. One of these is worth recording. Before the conquest of the lower R\u00e1vi Valley by R\u00e1j\u00e1 Sahila Varma of Brahmapura, the country in proximity to the present capital was ruled by a R\u00e1n\u00e1 who had his fort on the Bannu Hill overlooking the town, and separated from it by the S\u00e1l stream. From this R\u00e1n\u00e1 or one of his successors tribute was demanded by the new rulers, and this demand was persistently refused. The R\u00e1n\u00e1 in question may possibly be identical with a R\u00e1na Rihila, whose name, as also that of his R\u00e1ni, Balha, has been handed down by tradition. On being summoned to the presence of the R\u00e1j\u00e1, the R\u00e1n\u00e1 is said to have laid aside his insolent demeanour and meekly promised compliance with the royal demand; but on returning to the other side of the stream he became as obstinate as ever. After consultation the conclusion was come to, in explanation of this strange conduct, that it was due to the influence of the soil. To test this a quantity of earth was procured from Bannu Hill, and spread on the floor of the audience chamber, with a carpet over it, and the R\u00e1n\u00e1 was again invited to an interview. On arrival he took his seat on the carpet as usual. But when in the course of conversation reference was made to the matter of tribute he sprang to his feet, drew his sword, and demanded to know who had a right to ask tribute of him. The result doubtless was his expulsion, or removal to another place where the soil did not exert this evil influence. A similar tradition is found in Kulu, and other parts of the hills, and is significant of the state of tension which seems to have existed between the various chiefs and their over-lords. That this tension resulted\nin open strife, and the complete subjection of the R\u00e1n\u00e1s, seems only too probable, and to this we may attribute the fact that at the present time so many of them have nothing but their title to prove their ancient lineage and the former importance of their families.\n\nThe title r\u00e1n\u00e1 has now become a caste name and at the last census 94 males and 84 females were returned under this name. The exact number of existing R\u00e1n\u00e1 families in the State is not known, but they probably number not less than 20 or 30. As a rule they marry among themselves or with good R\u00e1jput families but most of those who have been reduced to the position of common agriculturists marry in their own caste or with Th\u00e1kurs or R\u00e1this.\n\nThe following list includes the principal R\u00e1n\u00e1 families in Chamb\u00e1:\n\n| Name          | Description | Place     | Pargans |\n|---------------|-------------|-----------|---------|\n| R\u00e1n\u00e1 L\u00e1i Chand | Jagird\u00e1r    | Triloknath | L\u00e1hul   |\n| Judhhir Singh |             | Ul\u00e1nasa   | Brahmaur |\n| Sahib Singh   |             | Gurola    |         |\n| Sacher Singh  |             | Suai      |         |\n| Sangara       |             | S\u00e1msa     | S\u00e1msa   |\n| Amin Chand    |             | Margraon  | L\u00e1hul   |\n| Shiv Day\u00e1l    | M\u00e1lghar\u00ed    | Gehra     | Pier    |\n| Kanaya Singh  |             | Aggy\u00e1r    | Bajnagar|\n\nThe most important R\u00e1n\u00e1 family in the State is that of Triloknath in Chamb\u00e1-L\u00e1hul, which has held a portion of the Chandr\u00e1bh\u00e1g\u00e1 Valley from time immemorial. The family tradition is that their ancestor came from Jammu, and settled in Tund\u00e1h, afterwards crossing the P\u00e1ng\u00ed Range to Triloknath before the idol of that name was set up. The R\u00e1n\u00e1 is a jagird\u00e1r, and his son is addressed as \"T\u00edk\u00e1.\"\n\nOne of his ancestors was called Hamfr Bardhaim, and his deeds are sung in the local dialect. He is reported to have defeated a Kulu Raja who tried to carry off the idol of Triloknath and was subsequently invited to a feast and murdered after having laid aside his armour. Though professedly a Hindu the R\u00e1n\u00e1 acts as manager of the Triloknath shrine and appoints the l\u00e1ma in attendance. At the annual mela connected with the shrine, on the last day of S\u00e1wan, he takes the leading part in the proceedings. His jagir includes the villages of Tunde, Kisori, Hinsa, Shokoli, Salgraon and part of Shor and Purthi in P\u00e1ng\u00ed, also the whole of the Miy\u00e1r N\u00e1li.\n\nThe R\u00e1n\u00e1s next in importance reside at Ul\u00e1nasa, Gurola and Suai, in Brahmaur, on the left bank of the R\u00e1vi, near its junction with the Budhal. According to tradition these three baronies were originally one fief, granted by R\u00e1j\u00e1 Mushan Varma to the R\u00e1n\u00e1 of\nUl\u00e1s\u00e1\u2014the common ancestor of the three families. The areas of their ranhus are as follows:\u2014Ul\u00e1s\u00e1, 376 acres; Gurola, 274 acres; Suai, 235 acres. The present R\u00e1n\u00e1 of Gurola is an old man of 70 and has no heir to succeed him. Till recently these R\u00e1n\u00e1s were under obligation to render military service, and the ancestor of the Ul\u00e1s\u00e1 R\u00e1n\u00e1 is said to have fallen at Nerti with R\u00e1j Singh. This obligation was commuted into a money payment by R\u00e1ja Sh\u00e1m Singh, of Rs. 100 annually in the case of Ul\u00e1s\u00e1, and Rs. 70 for Suai. The R\u00e1n\u00e1 of Gurola is exempt from payment. There is also a R\u00e1n\u00e1 at S\u00e1mra in the R\u00e1vi valley, whose ancestor is said to have come from Kaniy\u00e1ra in Riblu. He too is a jagird\u00e1r. His ancestors were hereditary keepers of the Prithvijor fort, having been appointed probably by R\u00e1ja Prithvi Singh. Another R\u00e1n\u00e1 holds a small j\u00e1gir at Margrion in Chamb\u00e1-L\u00e1hul.\n\nThe agricultural R\u00e1n\u00e1s are found in the parganas of Kothiranhu, Pinru, R\u00e1jnagar, Loh-Tikri, Dhund, Tisa, Baira, Sai, Himgari, Kil\u00e1r and S\u00e1ch. They all enjoy exemption from beg\u00e1r or forced labour, and most of them have the rank of Akkar. One of the most interesting figures among the R\u00e1n\u00e1 farmers is the old R\u00e1n\u00e1 of S\u00e1lhi in P\u00e1ngi. Near his house is a huge fountain slab, containing a long inscription, erected by one of his ancestors, named R\u00e1j\u00e1naka Ludrap\u00e1la, in the reign of R\u00e1ja Lalita Varma (A.D. 1148-70). When, some years ago, the stone was thrown down by an avalanche the R\u00e1n\u00e1 took care to re-erect it as the embodiment of the departed glory of his house.\n\nVery few of the descendants of the old Th\u00e1kur chiefs are found in the State. One Th\u00e1kur family lives at Godin near Alw\u00e1s, and another at Kil\u00e1r in P\u00e1ngi, but both are now common farmers.\n\nAll the R\u00e1n\u00e1 and Th\u00e1kur families who are jagird\u00e1rs enjoy immunity from State service, but are under obligation to attend upon the R\u00e1j\u00e1, whenever ancient custom requires them to do so. On the demise of any of the R\u00e1n\u00e1s who are jagird\u00e1rs his successor has to come to Chamb\u00e1 in order to have his title verified; and a pattra is then granted, with a khilat in the case of the R\u00e1n\u00e1 of Triloknath. On the accession of a R\u00e1j\u00e1 the R\u00e1n\u00e1 of Triloknath tenders his allegiance in person and presents as his nazr\u00e1na a number of hill ponies.\n\nThe title of Akkar is given to men of good families throughout the State, who enjoy freedom from beg\u00e1r and have the privilege of appearing at the Kul\u00e1r Bhiri\u00ed Jalsa, when each of them presents a rupee as a nazr\u00e1na to the R\u00e1ja. In former times they were employed as soldiers. If the R\u00e1ja happens to be in their pargana they are under obligation to attend on him, and perform special services, such as carrying letters, etc., if required; but may not be impressed for loads or manual labour. There were 1,164 Akkars at the census of 1901, of whom 612 were in Bhattiy\u00e1t, 297 in the Sadar wizd\u00e1t, and 209 in Chur\u00fah; the rest being in Brahmaur and P\u00e1ngi.\nTable No. 16 gives the number of persons belonging to the various religions of the State, and the distribution of every 10,000 of the population by religion and sex at the three census periods of 1881, 1891 and 1901.\n\nThe Hindu religion is of course largely predominant, the Muhammadan invasion not having been very powerfully felt in this Hill tract.\n\nAmongst the Hind\u00fas, Shiv, Devi and N\u00e1g have the largest number of worshippers. Their shrines are frequent throughout the whole State, even to the furthest points in P\u00e1ng\u00ed and L\u00e1hul; N\u00e1g and Devi are worshipped for the protection of the cattle, the field, and the family. Th\u00e1kur and Shiv are worshipped in the morning, and in the evening; Devi on Tuesdays; N\u00e1g on Saturdays. Raghub\u00edr finds his adherents amongst the Rajputs. Vishnu, though commonly worshipped in Chamb\u00e1 city, has but few shrines in the State. The Cham\u00e1rs and other lower castes worship in the same fashion as the higher ones, but the Cham\u00e1rs in the capital are R\u00e1md\u00e1s\u00ed Sikhs, while the Meht\u00e1rs, who all came originally from the plains, are, like their brethren in the Punjab, followers of B\u00e1la Sh\u00e1h and B\u00e1l M\u00edk. The Mussalmans amongst them acknowledge L\u00e1l Beg as their leader in religion. The few Sikhs in the State do not differ from those in the plains. Throughout P\u00e1ng\u00ed and L\u00e1hul, Buddhists are not unfrequently found. There is a Mandar at Trilokn\u00e1th, which is regularly visited by l\u00e1m\u00e1s from Tibet, and different parts of China. Muhammadans are almost entirely confined to the wiz\u00e1rats of Chur\u00e1h and Chamb\u00e1, and they own many of the neat little shops that line the Chaug\u00e1n in Chamb\u00e1 city. There is but one mosque in the whole State, and it is situated in Chamb\u00e1 itself. P\u00edrs or Muhammadan saints are widely venerated by all classes of the people. They are worshipped on Thursdays, and also on special occasions when any wish has been attained.\n\nThe cult of Vishnu has but few shrines in Chamb\u00e1. This cult seems to have been introduced into the State in the early part of the tenth century, during the reign of Raja Sahila Varma, and flourished under the patronage of the Rajas, but did not gain much influence outside the capital. The chief temple is that of Lakshmi N\u00e1r\u00e1yan ascribed to Raja Sahila Varma. Other temples are those of Lakshmi-Damodar, Hari Rai, Bens\u00ed-Gop\u00e1l, Sita-R\u00e1m and R\u00e1dha-Krishna.\n\n(1) Raghub\u00edr is the name of R\u00e1ma the hero of the Ram\u00e1yna from whom many noble Rajput families claim direct descent.\n(2) P\u00edrs page 75.\nin Chamb\u00e1; and of Narsing at Brahmaur, all of which are described on pages 42-43 of the Gazetteer.\n\nThe priests of the Lakshmi Narayan, Lakshmi-Damodar and Radha-Krishna temples are Kolun Brahmans of the Kassib gotra; the Bensi-Gopal and Sita-Ram temples, Phale Pandit and Maryan Brahmans of the Bharadwaj gotra; and of the Hari Rai temple, Hariyan Brahmans of the Bharadwaj gotra.\n\nThe images are all of marble, the most richly adorned being that of Lakshmi-Narayan, which is the principal idol in Chamb\u00e1. They are bathed and dressed every morning; and bhog or food, consisting of rice, sugar, pilao and dal, etc., is offered five times a day at the principal shrines. Puja is performed morning and evening, at early dawn and dusk, and is accompanied by the blowing of the conch shell, ringing of bells and beating of drums. The idol is fanned with a fan of peacock feathers, while the officiating priest recites the mantras, burns incense and then waves a light, called arti, in front of the image. He then circumambulates the temple with a light in one hand which he waves at each point of the compass, and a bell in the other which is kept ringing. Finally, returning to the temple door he again waves the light usually seven times, again fans the idol and the puja is then complete. Parshad or consecrated food is then distributed to the people who may be present. Vishnu being regarded as the preserver of life, no sacrifices are offered at his shrines, nor at any of the Shiva temples within the enclosure\u2014which till recently also possessed the right of sanctuary.\n\nIn front of some of the Vishnu temples is a round pillar, surmounted by a brass figure of a kite or eagle. This is the cahan or vehicle of the god. The chakra or discus on the top of these temples is believed to represent the Sun\u2014Vishnu being a sun-god.\n\nThe following are the other Vishnu shrines in the State:\n\nAs Sri Thakur Murli Manohar-ji he has a temple at Rajnagar. As Thakur-ji he has a mandar in the gothi at Tisa, in Gudda village of Lohikeri pargana, and in Garh of Bairi pargana. As Thakur Nar Singh he has one at Bartgal in pargana Bhalei.\n\nAt Rajnagar the temple is of stone, of two storeys, roofed with slates and surrounded by a verandah. The others are one-storeyed, and built of wood. The idols are invariably of stone. The former contains two images, one as tall as a child two years old, the other much smaller. At Tisa the image is as tall as a child of four. At Gudda there are three images of Thakur Bensi-Gopal and Lakshmi Nath, each as tall as a child of six. At Garh the two images are as high as a child of six months, and at Bartgal is a single image, as tall as a child of a year old, and accompanied by eight stone symbols of Mahadeo, each an inch in height. The incumbents are usually Brahmans, the one at Tisa being of the Kalian got, and at Garh a Kassib, but at Gudda the pujaris are Rathis. All the offices are hereditary. At Rajnagar and at Garh a jagra (vigil) is held on the Janam Ashtami, and at Tisa and Bartgal bhog is offered twice daily, but at Gudda it is only offered once a week.\n\nMany of the larger temples in the State\u2014especially those of Vishnu and Shiva and the principal Devis\u2014possess rich endowments, in the form of grants of land called sasan, conferred by former Rajas; and the revenue is devoted to the maintenance of the temple fabrics.\n\n---\n\n(1) The arti is done from right to left, and the circumambulation with the right side towards the temple.\nand the services. The Lakshmi Narayan temple is the most richly endowed and owns lands bringing in a large revenue in cash and kind. The administration of the sasan lands, attached to the temples, is in the hands of a State official, called Thakur ka Wazir, who is appointed by the Raja; and he is assisted by a staff of subordinates, some in the capital and others in the parganas. All disbursements for the various temples under his charge are made by the Wazir.\n\nOfferings in money are credited into the treasury of the Lakshmi Narayan temple, which also contains a large collection of valuables, the accumulation of many centuries.\n\nThe cult of Shiva is widely prevalent in Chamb\u00e1, and must be of very ancient origin for some of the temples date from the reign of Meru Varma, A.D. 700. Shiva is believed to have his abode for half the year on the Kailas peak at Mani Mahes, and for this reason the Brahmaur pargana is spoken of as Shivbhum or Shiva\u2019s land. On 1st Assuj he retires to the lower regions, called Piy\u00e1lpur (Pat\u00e1lpur) where he remains till the feast of Shiv\u00e1tri in Ph\u00e1gun, when he returns to his summer residence. The Gaddis, who are devotees of Shiva regulate their migrations by these two dates: leaving their summer pastures in the inner mountains on the former and their winter pastures near the plains on the latter of these dates. All the State kothis are regarded as under the special care of K\u00e1li who usually has a shrine in each. Ganesha, Shiva\u2019s son, is also extensively worshipped in the State, and one of the oldest temples in Brahmaur is dedicated to this god.\n\nThere are many temples to Shiva throughout the whole State. The principal Shiva temples at the capital are those of Chandergupt, Trimukha and Gauri Shankar. The first two are linga temples; the third contains two finely moulded figures in brass of Shiva and P\u00e1rvati. These temples are served by Kolue, Pandit and P\u00e1de Brahmins of the K\u00e1ssib, Atri and Bh\u00e1rdw\u00e1j gotras. The Chandergupt temple is ascribed to Raja Sahila Varma, and that of Gauri Shankar to his son, Yug\u00e1kar Varma. At Brahmaur is the Mani Mahesa temple, originally erected by Raja Meru Varma, as stated in the inscription on the brazen bull, but the present structure is more recent. At Saho is the temple of Chandra Shekhara, built about the time of Sahila Varma. In front of each temple stands the figure of a bull, usually of stone: this is the v\u00e1han or carrier of the god, and his temples are often surmounted by a trident, supposed to represent lightning.\n\nAnimal sacrifice, called niw\u00e1la, is a common feature of Shiva worship. Bhog or food\u2014consisting of rice, d\u00e1l and ghi\u2014is offered twice a day.\n\nBuddhism prevails to a small extent in L\u00e1hul; but in a very impure form and closely associated with the N\u00e1g and Devi cults. The mandar at Triloknath is served by a l\u00e1ma, and is visited by pilgrims from India, Tibet and Nep\u00e1l: being in fact quite as much a Hindu as a Buddhist place of pilgrimage. The image is of marble; and the temple is under the control of the R\u00e1n\u00e1 of Triloknath, who draws the revenues and receives the offerings. Buddhist customs are also found in the Bhotauri villages of P\u00e1ng\u00ed.\nThe cult of Lakhd\u00e1ta or \"the Bountiful\" is of some interest. It is the same as that of Sakhi Sarwar Sult\u00e1n so common on the plains. This Muhammadan saint lived in the middle of the 12th century, and his real name was Sayad Ahmad. His principal shrine is at Nig\u00e1ha in the Dera Gh\u00e1zi Kh\u00e1n District.(1) His shrines are resorted to by both Hindus and Muhammadans. In most cases the incumbents of his temples, asth\u00e1ns or mandars, are Muhammadans, (muj\u00e1vars), but at B\u00e1ri in pargana Ch\u00e1nju the puj\u00e1ra is a Billu Brabman, and at Phulra in Himgari the puj\u00e1ra or muj\u00e1var is a R\u00e1thi and the chela a Muhammadan. These offices appear to be always hereditary. Wrestling matches\u2014called chhinj\u2014and associated with the Lakhd\u00e1ta cult\u2014are held yearly in every pargana of Chur\u00e1h and in some parganas of the Sadr wiz\u00e1rat, as well as in Bhattiyat. No satisfactory explanation of this association is forthcoming. The chief shrines in the State are at:\n\n| Village       | Pargana   | Date of fairs, &c. | Images          |\n|---------------|-----------|--------------------|-----------------|\n| Bhujr\u00e1ru      | Tis\u00e1      | Fairs.             | Wrestling.      |\n| Marh Buhiar   | Kh\u00e1r      | 13th Har.          | On 14th         |\n| Jow\u00e1nah       | Bh\u00e1ndal   | 5th Har.           | On 6th          |\n| Jal\u00e1ri        | Ditto     |                    |                 |\n| Indarw\u00e1li     | Godi\u00e1l    |                    |                 |\n| D\u00e1nalgala     | Koh\u00e1l     | 11th Sawan.        | On 12th         |\n| Haranj\u00e1r      | Baira     | 21st Har.          | On 22nd         |\n| Banjoh        | Koh\u00e1l     | 9th Har.           | On 10th         |\n| Pukhar        | Tariod    | 12th Har.          | On 13th         |\n| Daloi         | Pichhla Diur | 12th Har.       | On 13th         |\n| Jal\u00e1khri      | Panjila   |                    | A lamp.         |\n\nA wrestling match is held on the 19th of Bhadon in mauza Baroz, pargana Godial; on the 12th of Bh\u00e1don in mauza Durgala, pargana Godial; and on the 11th of S\u00e1wan in mauza Bhalotha, pargana Godial.\n\nAll the images in the following shrines are of stone erected in the ground:\n\n| Village       | Pargana   | Date of fairs, &c. | Images          |\n|---------------|-----------|--------------------|-----------------|\n| Thod\u00fa-Maq\u00e1m   | R\u00e1junagar | Fairs.             | Wrestling.      |\n| B\u00e1ri          | Ch\u00e1nju    | 11th Har.          | On 12th         |\n| Phulra        | Himgari   | 9th Har.           | On 10th         |\n| Khandi Dh\u00e1r   | Ditto     | 10th Har.          | On 11th         |\n| Baid\u00edll\u00ed      | Barnot\u00e1   | 11th Har.          | On 12th         |\n| Than\u00e1i        | Bagor     | 12th Har.          | On 13th         |\n| Garh          | Tis\u00e1      | 13th Har.          | On 14th         |\n| Khal\u00e1t        | Bhalei    | 16th Har.          | On 16th         |\n\n1) Vide Punjab Ethnography, 1881, paragraph 221.\nNearly all these temples are ascribed to the era of Mushan Varma, which simply means that they are believed to be very old, but they cannot be older than the 12th century. That at Baidial dates from the time of Rana Buddha, and those at Khalat, Thakruni, Thanai, and Garh are of quite recent foundation.\n\nThe types of Lakhda's temples are not uniform. They may be square, or oblong in shape, of one or two storeys in height, and with one or two rooms. But all contain one, two, or three lamps, usually of iron, but sometimes of copper, earth, or stone, suspended from the roof, or placed on a rock within the shrine.\n\nTwo kundas, or large iron cups, are sometimes placed beside the lamp. A white flag is commonly flown over the building. The images are usually of black stone, standing erect upon the ground.\n\nOfferings.\u2014Churma (ghi, gur and flour mixed), gur and ghi with animal sacrifice.\n\nThe Siddhas are said by Monier Williams to be semi-divine beings supposed to possess purity. They probably represent deified ascetics of ancient times. They are propitiated in the same manner as the Nagas and Devis.\n\nThere are temples to Siddhas at Chhatri, in pargana Kobal, at Alla in Pichhla Daur, at Ghorni in Kibar, at Sabil in Kibar, at Jharoli and Saroga in Kibar, at Siddhakdera in Pangi, and to Nanga Siddh at Rajnagar and at Mua in that pargana. It will be seen that all but the latter are nameless Siddhas. The temple at Chhatri is a square building, one storey high, built of wood and roofed with slates, and is said to have been built in the reign of Musha Varma. It contains three images of stone, each the miniature of a man, riding a horse of stone. The hereditary chela and pujara are Rathis by caste. The temple contains ten iron chains and three maces, which are taken from village to village during the eight days commencing from the Janam Ashtami. The god is supposed to make a tour during this period, and villagers, who are under a vow, then make offerings which serve as his bhog throughout the year. Bhog is offered to the god, and he is worshipped once a day.\n\nThe other Siddh temples resemble that at Chhatri in construction, and all are said to date from the time of Musha Varma. Their images are precisely the same in character but vary in number, there being four at Alla, two at Ghorni, five at Sabil, two at Jharoli and Saroga, one at Rajnagar, and three at Mua (Moa).\n\nThe chelas and pujaras are hereditary, but of different castes, being Chamars at Alla, Rathis at Ghorni, Sabil Brahmins at Jharoli, Rathis at Saroga and Rajnagar, and Halis at Moa. In only one instance it will be seen are they Brahmins. The Siddhas of these places also go on tour precisely like the Siddh of Chhatri and at the same period. In some cases the chela and pujara divide the cash offerings, reserving those in kind for the Siddh.\n\nThe deified hero of the Mundlikh cult is doubtless the valiant Rajput champion, Gugga Chauhan, who lived at Garh Dandora, near Bindraban, in the time of Prithvi Raj, the last Hindu King of\n\n---\n\n(1) Vide Archaeological Survey Report, vol. xiv, pp. 81\u201484 and xvii, p. 169. Jaya Chandra, the last Raja of Kanauj, was also called Mundlikh by the Champan barda. He fell in battle with the Muhammadans, A.D. 1194. Vide also Kangra Gazetteer, p. 109.\nDelhi, A.D. 1170\u201493. Gugga is said to have fought many battles with the Muhammadans, and in the last his head was severed from his body; hence the name Mundl\u00edkh, from munda head, and likh a line. He is said to have continued fighting without the head and by some to have disappeared in the ground, only the point of his spear remaining visible. The legend is sung to the accompaniment of music by the hill bards, and with such pathos that their audiences are often moved to tears. Mundl\u00edkh's death is supposed to have taken place on the ninth day of the dark half of the moon in Bh\u00e1don, and from that date for eight days his shr\u00e1da, called Guggna\u00edh, is yearly observed at his shrines. He is represented by a stone figure of a man on horseback, accompanied by similar figures of his sister Guggar\u00e1, a deified heroine, his Waz\u00edr, Kailu and others. The rites of worship are much the same as at Devi temples.\n\nMundl\u00edkh has a mandar at Garh in pargana T\u00eds\u00e1, another at Palewar in Sahu, and Gugga Mundl\u00edkh Siddha has one at Sh\u00e1l\u00fa in Himgari. The temples are of wood and stone.\n\nThe images are of stone, but vary in size and number, that at Garh being about a foot high, and that of Palewar containing four idols mounted on horseback, while at Sh\u00e1l\u00fa, Gugga Mundl\u00edkh is represented by the statue of a boy of twelve. There are no incumbents at Garh, but at Palewar the chela and puj\u00e1ra are weavers, in whose families the offices are hereditary. Gugga's chela and puj\u00e1ra are Cham\u00e1rs, and their offices are also hereditary. The Mundl\u00edkh of Garh goes on tour for eight days after the Janam Ashtami in Bh\u00e1don. He of Palewar goes on tour for three days after, and Gugga's chain and umbrella (chhatar) are paraded through the villages for the eight days after the Janam Ashtami.\n\nThe N\u00e1g and Dev\u00ed cults are the oldest in the hills and may be regarded as, in part at least, of aboriginal origin. They are everywhere predominant among the villagers and have a much stronger hold on their minds than the later symbols of Hinduism. In times of sickness in their families or disease among their cattle and flocks, it is to the village shrines they resort in the hope of obtaining relief. These hill godlings are legion, almost every village has its own special deities, and the priests are more frequently Rajputs and R\u00e1this than Brahmins; they may even be of low caste. Sacrifice of animals is a universal religious rite, and many traditions are still current pointing to the fact of human sacrifice having been prevalent in former times.\n\nThe N\u00e1g shrines are very numerous, and there are also N\u00e1g\u00ed shrines, but the latter are not common. The image in these shrines is usually of stone in human form, with the figure of a snake entwined around it and a serpent canopy over head. The shrine also contains figures of snakes in stone and iron, with a tirsul or trident, a lamp, an incense holder, a gurj or weapon like a sword, and finally the iron chain or sangal with which the chela scourges himself. This is said to be an exact copy of that shown in the hand of the Egyptian god Osiris.(1) Springs of water are believed to be\n\n(1) The Sun and the Serpent, page 98.\nunder the control of these snake godlings, and, in some parts of the hills, to such a degree are springs and wells associated with snake influence in the minds of the people that N\u00e1g is the name in common use for a spring of cool and refreshing water. A spring will usually be found in proximity to a N\u00e1g temple. Many of the N\u00e1ga godlings are believed to have the power to grant rain, and in times of drought they are diligently propitiated. J\u00e1g\u00e1s or vigils are held in connection with the temple; incense is burnt and sheep and goats are offered in sacrifice. The puj\u00e1ra gets the head and the chela the shoulder, while the low caste musicians are given the entrails, and cooked food. The rest of the animal is taken away and consumed by the offerer, and his family or friends. Money offered is equally divided between the puj\u00e1ra and chela, also dry grain. If people belonging to a low caste offer cooked food, which is not often done, it is given back to them after being presented to the N\u00e1g. A j\u00e1g\u00e1 or vigil is always held at the time of a mela, which as a rule takes place once a year at each shrine.\n\nThe Devis are female deities, and are believed to have power to inflict and remove disease in man and beast. They are not associated with springs like the N\u00e1gs. It is common to find a N\u00e1g and a Dev\u00ed temple side by side, and similar attributes are ascribed to both. Some of them, like the N\u00e1gs, have the power to grant rain.\n\nThe worship is similar to that at N\u00e1g temples and the offerings are disposed of in the same manner.\n\nThe image is usually of stone in human form, but snake figures are not as a rule present. The temple furnishings are similar to those of N\u00e1g temples. In front of the Dev\u00ed temples may usually be seen the figure of a tiger in stone: this is the s\u00e1han or vehicle of the goddess. The most famous Dev\u00ed temples are the following:\u2014Lakshmi Dev\u00ed at Brahmaur; Shakti Dev\u00ed at Chhatr\u00e1ri; Ch\u00e1munda Dev\u00ed at Chamb\u00e1 and Dev\u00ed Kothi; Mindhal Dev\u00ed in P\u00e1ngi; and Mirkula Dev\u00ed in L\u00e9hul.\n\nThe opinion has recently been advanced by Brigade Surgeon Oldham that the N\u00e1ga and Dev\u00ed cults had their origin in a form of hero and ancestor worship; and that the so-called snake gods and Devis are the deified rulers of the people whose racial emblem was the hooded snake. Dr. Oldham brings forward a large amount of evidence of a varied and interesting character, in support of his view.\n\nThat many of the godlings of the hills are really deified ancestors and heroes of ancient time, seems hardly open to doubt. The Birs, R\u00e1ja Mundl\u00edkh and other deities are believed by the people themselves to be of this character.\n\nDr. Vogel holds a different opinion regarding the nature of snake worship. He says:\n\n\"The numerous legends relating to the N\u00e1gas which are either found in Brahmanic and Buddhist literature or are still current in the valleys of the Himalaya, can, in my opinion, only lead to one conclusion regarding the true nature of so-called serpent worship. The N\u00e1gas are water spirits, and in worshipping them the alternately beneficial and\n\n(1) The Sun and the Serpent, by Brigade Surgeon G. F. Oldham.\ndestructive power of the water is propitiated. That this water-worship became so prevalent among the agricultural population of India cannot be a matter of surprise. It goes back undoubtedly to a very remote age as appears from its frequent mention in ancient literature. That nowadays it is chiefly found in the hills, is an instance of an ancient cult having been preserved in the highlands, which in the plains has been swept away by more advanced forms of religion. But in ancient times it was certainly not restricted to the hills. We thus understand why Buddhist authors and sculptors were equally anxious to represent the N\u00e1ga kings as converts and worshippers of the Buddha. It shows that in the early days of Buddhism the N\u00e1gas themselves had numerous devotees all over India.\"\n\nThe N\u00e1g and Dev\u00ed temples are all erected on much the same plan, and are usually situated in a clump of cedar trees near a village. Such trees around a temple may not be cut down and are regarded as the property of the deity residing in their midst. Sometimes a temple may be erected within the interior of a forest or in some mountain ravine, standing quite alone.\n\nThe usual pattern is a square resting on a raised platform of stone. The building itself may be entirely of wood, or of the wood and stone style of architecture so common in the hills. It generally consists of a central cella with an open verandah around it and a small door in front. The whole is covered in with a pentroof of wood which either slopes on two sides from a central ridge, or on four sides from a surmounting cap or ball. This roof is supported on cross beams resting on wooden, or wood and stone pillars, one at each corner of the platform, with intermediate supports if necessary. Sometimes the verandah is entirely closed in, with only a doorway opposite the door of the cella. The cella remains the same from age to age, and is not renewed unless it becomes ruinous, but the roof is frequently renewed as a mark of respect to the deity within. This, however, is not now done as often as was the custom in former times, and in many cases repairs are carried out only when absolutely necessary. The woodwork of the verandah is covered in parts with carvings of a grotesque character, while hanging around are the horns of animals which have been offered in sacrifice, with bells suspended over the doorway, and sometimes a pole in front, called dhuj.(1) The image is inside the cella. The temples have probably remained much the same in shape and structure since the earliest times. Occasionally they consist of a small cella only of the simplest kind, with no verandah\u2014often too the image may be seen resting in the open, under a cedar tree, with little to indicate its character except the red paint, and oily appearance from the ghi with which it is besmeared.\n\nThe rites of worship are similar at both N\u00e1g and Dev\u00ed temples. Bloody sacrifice holds the foremost place. On ordinary occasions incense is burned, and circumambulation of the cella within the verandah is performed by the priest. There is also the ringing of bells, and the sounding of the conch shell, accompanied by the beating of drums. A mela is usually held once a year at each temple, when a great concourse of people takes place on the green near the shrine; and all are seated in prescribed order according to ancient custom\u2014a special place being reserved for the officials of the pargana in which the temple is situated. Music and dancing, and often drinking, play an important part at these melas. Each temple has a puj\u00e1ra or priest, who may be of any caste, and a chela, who is usually a low caste man. The god or goddess is supposed to speak through the chela, who is believed to become inspired by the deity. Seated at the door of the temple he inhales the fumes of burning cedar wood from a vessel held before him, while he is fanned by\n\n(1) This is probably meant to represent the standard of the god.\na man standing near. The drums are beaten furiously\u2014soon he begins to quiver and tremble, and this trembling increases till the entire body shares in the incessant motion, this being the recognized sign of the god having entered into him. Continuing to work himself into a frenzy he springs to his feet and dances madly, scourging himself all the time with the sangal or the tirzul which he holds in his hand, sometimes with such severity as to draw blood. The harsh and discordant music gets louder and wilder, and others join in the dance, forming a circle with the chela in their midst. A goat is then brought forward and presented to the god\u2014and water is thrown upon it and put into its ear to make it tremble\u2014this being the sign that the victim has been accepted. Forthwith the head is struck off and presented to the god, and in some cases the chela drinks the warm blood as it flows from the quivering carcass. The dancing proceeds more wildly than ever till at last the chela calls out that the god has come\u2014all are then silent and questions are asked by the people and answered by the chela, as the mouthpiece of the god. Having done his part the chela sinks on the ground exhausted, and is brought round by fanning and sprinkling water on his face and chest. The people then disperse to their homes.\n\nThe temples may be visited in times of drought and famine, or pestilence in man or beast, also by individuals on account of any special circumstances such as sickness or for any family or personal reason. These are called j\u0101tra, and on the way to the temple round marks are made with rice-water on the stones by the way side, probably to indicate that the pilgrimage has been performed. Only special N\u00e1g have the reputation of being able to give rain, and in time of drought those shrines are much frequented, the same procedure being adopted as that already described. Sheep and goats are freely offered at such times. If rain falls too abundantly the N\u00e1g shrine is again resorted to with offerings, to constrain the god to stay his hand.\n\nThere are many traditions current in the hills which point to human sacrifices having been frequent at N\u00e1g and Dev\u00ed temples in former times. In P\u00e1ngi and other parts of the Chandra-Bh\u00e1ga Valley a singular custom obtains in connection with N\u00e1g worship. For a fixed time every year in the month of S\u00e1wan, and sometimes for the whole of that month, all the milk of the village is devoted to the local N\u00e1g and is then said to be suchcha. The villagers do not use it themselves, that is, they do not drink it, and they are very unwilling to supply milk to travellers during the period. The milk is churned as usual, and ghi is made from it, the buttermilk being stored and used up at feasts held on certain days during the month. Every few days an offering of milk and sweet bread is made to the N\u00e1g, some of the milk being sprinkled over it. It is also smeared with ghi. A final feast is held at the end of the month. In P\u00e1ngi only 15 day are observed, and this only in the lower part of the valley.\n\nGenerally speaking, the foundation of the N\u00e1g and Dev\u00ed temples is ascribed to the era of Raja Mush\u00e9 Varma, A.D. 820\u201440, but most of them probably are of much older date. Three temples, two of Mahal N\u00e1g, and one of Jamun N\u00e1g at Bani, are said to have been built in the time of R\u00e1m\u00e1 Buddha (1).\n\nFurther the puj\u00e1ras and chelas are most commonly R\u00e1this by caste but, in a good many cases, only the puj\u00e1ra is a R\u00e1thi, the chela being a H\u00e1li, as in the temples of K\u00e1l\u00fa N\u00e1g and Manovar N\u00e1g at Bh\u00e1r\u00e1ram, Mahal N\u00e1g at B\u00e1th\u00fala, Nandy\u00e1sar N\u00e1g at Puddh\u00e1, Tarawan N\u00e1g at Lunkh, Him N\u00e1g at Bhar\u00e1win, Mahal N\u00e1g at Bairi and Bairo, Muthal N\u00e1g\n\n(1) A famous R\u00e1m\u00e1 of the olden time who lived in Barnota pargana\u2014date unknown.\nIn some cases the puj\u0101ra is a H\u0101li, e.g., at the temples of Bhudhu N\u0101g at Lamhota, Parchut N\u0101g at Andw\u0101s, Sri N\u0101g Sulji at Sundaj, Thamang N\u0101g at Gung R\u0101s, Kalan N\u0101g at Kh\u0101landar. At Sri Potir N\u0101g\u2019s temple at Bhinan the puj\u0101ra and chela are both Kolis; at Kalan N\u0101g\u2019s temple at Chilli they are both Bhachhira Gaddis; at Handol N\u0101g\u2019s temple at Chandrola both are Battan Gaddis; at Sagta N\u0101g\u2019s at Bani Sagwari both are Sapahi Gaddis.\n\nBrahmans are incumbents of the following temples:\u2014 Mahal N\u0101g\u2019s at Bani (Brahmans of the Padh\u0101 got, with H\u0101li chelas); Thainang N\u0101g\u2019s at Dir\u014dg and Mahr N\u0101g\u2019s at Manglana (of the Kali\u0101n got also chelas); Mahal N\u0101g\u2019s at Jamoh\u0101r (of the Kali\u0101n got with H\u0101li chelas); at Thainang N\u0101g\u2019s temple at Kh\u0101ront (of the Ratan P\u0101l got with R\u0101thi chelas); at Thainang N\u0101g\u2019s temple at Balnora (of the Kali\u0101n got, also chelas); at Ham N\u0101g\u2019s at Talh\u0101na (of the K\u0101ssab got, also chelas); at N\u0101g Belodar\u2019s and Mahal N\u0101g\u2019s at Jangal Bani (of the Kali\u0101n got, also chelas); at Sindhu N\u0101g\u2019s at Sundh\u0101r (Gaur Brahmins, also chelas); at Bajor N\u0101g\u2019s at Sirba (Gaur Brahmins, also chelas); at Balodar\u2019s at Baldrum the puj\u0101ra is a Kandu Brahman; at Mahal N\u0101g\u2019s at Tal\u0101r he is a Tharato Brahman; at Karanagar N\u0101g\u2019s in Saur\u0101r he is a Lecha Brahman, with a R\u0101thi chela; at Sudhun N\u0101g\u2019s in Suri a Kali\u0101n, also with a R\u0101thi chela; at Sar N\u0101g\u2019s in Sarasra he is a K\u0101ssab; at Jamun N\u0101g\u2019s at Bari Jamuh\u0101r he is a Kali\u0101n with a R\u0101thi chela; and at R\u0101h N\u0101g\u2019s temple in Rah he is a K\u0101ssab with a H\u0101li chela.\n\nIn P\u0101ngi Brahman puj\u0101ras officiate at the shrines of Mindhal Devi at Mindhal; Kanu N\u0101g at Re; and Marknla Devi at Tindi and Udaipur; R\u0101nas are the puj\u0101ras at Kil\u0101r and S\u0101thi; and R\u0101this with H\u0101li chelas at all the other shrines.\n\nThe following are some of the legends associated with special N\u0101gs and Dev\u012bs, in different parts of the State:\n\nB\u0101sak N\u0101g was brought from Bhadraw\u0101h 100 years ago, because disease was prevalent among the cattle of the State. B\u0101san N\u0101g and N\u0101gni were also brought from Bhadraw\u0101h on a similar occasion, and Digghu N\u0101g from P\u0101ngi.\n\nIndru N\u0101g derives his name from Indra. Tradition says that a R\u0101na from Suket came to Kauy\u0101ra in Kangra, thence to Kor\u0101si, and thence to S\u0101mr\u016b, the N\u0101g and his puj\u0101ra accompanying the R\u0101na. The N\u0101g\u2019s disciple, Dhunda, was drowned in D\u0101ln\u0101g, and his idol was also cracked in its temple. In one of its hands it holds a trident; in the other a chain, with which the chelas beat themselves.\n\nKalih\u0101r N\u0101g, his original name, now better known as Kelang, came from British-L\u0101hul. Fifteen or sixteen generations ago cattle disease was prevalent at Kugti, and the people of that village vowed to hold a fair, if it abated. Tradition says that Kalang, in the form of a serpent, rode on the horns of a ram from L\u0101hul, and stopped at D\u0101ghi two miles from the present temple. Remaining there for three generations, he went to Dar\u016bn at the source of a stream, a cold place difficult of access; so the people petitioned his chela to remove lower down, and the N\u0101g, through his chela, told them to cast a bh\u0101ra(1) from that place, and to build a new temple at\n\n---\n\n(1) A musical instrument like a plate of metal, which is struck with a stick.\nthe spot where it stopped. By digging the foundations, they found a three-headed image of stone, and on removing it a stream gushed forth. This was many generations ago. This image is in the Padamasaan. Sri Singh presented a second image of eight metals (ashtadhat), which stands upright, holding a latthi or pole in its right hand. Its head is covered with figures of serpents, and it wears a necklace of chaklas with a janco and toragi or waistbelt and pazab (loin cloth), all of serpents. This temple is closed from Magh 1st to Baisakh 1st. At other times worship is performed every Sunday, but only sheep and goats are accepted as offerings.\n\nBrahmani Devi's history is this. A Brahmani had a son, who had a pet chakor (partridge), which was killed by a peasant. The boy died of grief, and his mother became sati, burning herself with her son and the partridge, and began to afflict the people, so they built her a temple.\n\nDevi Chamunda of Gawari revealed herself in a dream to Raja Sri Singh, and ordered him to remove her from Prithvijor to this place. The temple at Sri was built by Raja Uggar Singh who vowed to make it, if it ceased raining, it having rained incessantly when he had gone to bathe at Mani Mahesh.\n\nDevi Chhatrathari or Adshakti, \"original power,\" has a curious legend. A land-owner suspected his cowherd of milking his cow in the forest, so he kept watch and found that the cow gave her milk at a spot under a tree. The goddess then appeared to him in a dream, and begged him to bring her to light. Searching at the spot the man found a stone pindi or image, which he was taking to his home, when it stopped at a certain spot, and there its temple was built. Raja Bala Bhadra (A.D. 1589\u20141641) granted it 36 lahris of land whence the devi was called Chhatrathari.\n\nThe legend of Det Nag at Kilar is that he was originally located in Lohol, and human victims were offered to him. The lot had fallen on the only remaining son of a poor widow, and she was bewailing her misfortune when a Gaddi passed by and, hearing the tale of woe, offered to take her son's place. He, however, stipulated that the Nag should be allowed to devour him, and on his presenting several parts of his body in succession without any result he got angry and threw the Nag into the Chandrabhaga. It got out of the river at Kilar and being found by a cowherd was carried up to the site of the present temple, when it fell from his back with the face on the ground. A shrine was erected and the image set up with its face looking inwards; and a clump of cedar trees at once grew up around the shrine.\n\nThe legend associated with Mindhal Devi is as follows:\u2014The spot where the temple stands was originally occupied by a house, consisting of an upper and a lower storey, as is usual in Pangi, belonging to a widow with seven sons. One day in early autumn while she was cooking in the upper storey a black stone appeared in the chula causing her much annoyance. She tried to beat it down but in vain. At last she was seized with a trembling, and thus knew that the stone was a devi. Rushing outside she called to her sons, who were ploughing in a field with two oxen to a plough, that a devi had appeared in the house. They made light of the matter and asked tauntingly if the devi would enable them to plough with one ox, or give them a sasan. Immediately the widow and her sons were turned to stone, she in the house, and they in the field. From that time only one ox to a plough has been used in ploughing at Mindhal and the place has been a sasan grant for many centuries.\n\n(1) Sitting cross-legged in the attitude of devotion, like representations of Buddha.\n(2) This temple was erected in the reign of Raja Mara Varma, (A.D. 680\u2014700).\n(3) The people believe that if two oxen are used one of them will die.\nThe Muhammadans in the State are mostly Sunnis and are found only in the Chamba and Churah wiz\u00e1rats. Most of those in the capital are Kashmiris. They are by no means strict in the observance of the rites of their religion, and many Hindu customs and superstitions are common among them. The worship of P\u00edrs is a leading feature of their religious life, and there are two zi\u00e1rats in the vicinity of the town; that of Sh\u00e1h Mad\u00e1r on the hill behind Chamba; and of Sh\u00e1h Jam\u00e1l at R\u00e1jpur. The former is ancient and probably identical with the Mi\u00e1n Bib\u00ed cult of which a full account will be found in the Gazetteer of the Hoshy\u00e1rpur District. Sh\u00e1h Jam\u00e1l is said to have come to Chamba in the reign of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Charat Singh, A.D. 1808\u201444, and is believed to have checked the ravages of cattle disease, then raging in the State, by giving his own life. The Muhammadans also venerate Lakhd\u00e1ta, whose shrine is at Jal\u00e1khr\u00ed, near the town.\n\nThese shrines are visited by Hindus as well as Muhammadans, and money and other offerings are presented which are the perquisite of the Muj\u00e1war. Among Muhammadans it is customary to visit these shrines on the occasion of the jattu, or cutting of the first hair in children. The only mosque in the State is in the town of Chamba.\n\nBenevolent and malevolent spirits are regarded as spiritual and invisible beings unless when for some special reason they assume bodily form. They have no shrines or visible symbols, but to each group a special locality or habitat is assigned by popular superstition, where they may be propitiated. The customary rites are much the same as at N\u00e1g and Dev\u00ed temples. Some of them, e.g., the B\u00edrs, are believed to be the disembodied spirits of ancient heroes and champions, who have the power to resume bodily form at pleasure; others are the ghosts of the dead which must be propitiated to avert calamity. The following are some of them:\n\n*Khetr-p\u00e1l* is the god of the soil, and is propitiated to secure a bountiful harvest. This is done before beginning to plough, and especially before breaking up new ground that has never been under cultivation, or that has long lain fallow. A sheep or a goat may be offered or incense is burnt.\n\nGreat importance is attached to this offering in breaking up new ground. A stone is set up in a corner of the field as the symbol of the god of the soil, and on it the sheep or goat is sacrificed after having been taken all round the field. The head is buried in the ground, the rest of the sacrifice being taken home and consumed by the family. Until this sacrifice is made the ground is looked upon as lifeless, and devoid of fertilizing power. A similar custom is observed before beginning to reap the harvest. A sheep or goat may be offered, but this is not done every year in the case of ground under cultivation, either at seed time or harvest. Usually the offering consists of sweet bread and incense along with the first fruits of the crop. Before beginning to build a house it is considered imperative to propitiate the earth-god with a sacrifice. Sometimes the offering is made after the house is finished, and the blood of the slain animal is then sprinkled on the door frames. Traditions are still current which leave\nno doubt of the fact of human sacrifice having been common in former times in building a fort or palace. The victim was buried beneath the foundations to ensure the stability of the walls.\n\nThe tutelary gods presiding over each clan and family are also reverenced. Thus in the case of the Gaddis the clan-god is Shiva, and for this reason Gadderan is often called Shivbhumi or Shiva's land. Raghubir is the clan-god of the Rajputs(1). The tutelary goddess of the family is called kulaj, thus the family goddess of the Chamba Rajas is Champavati, whose legend will be found at page 74 of the History. Ancestor worship is exceedingly common throughout the State, and is found in special forms analogous to those of the aboriginal races. In autar-worship, or the propitiation of the ghost of a man who has died sonless, there is a survival of the ancient belief in the harmful influence of the ghosts of the dead. Other forms of ancestor-worship will be hereafter referred to, bearing a close similarity to those of the aboriginal races.\n\nThe spirits of the mountain are all dread realities to the hillman. In his disordered fancy every peak and pass is the abode of demons called Rakshasa or Raksas, who control the winds and the storms. When the tempest rages on the mountain summit he believes the Raksas are contending with one another, the falling rock and the avalanche are the weapons of their wrath. In ascending a snowy pass the coolies often refrain from all noise till they reach the top, lest they should inadvertently offend the spirit of the mountain, and bring destruction on themselves; and no Gaddi would think of crossing a pass without first propitiating the pass-deity to secure fair weather, and a safe passage for his flocks. A cairn with flags hanging from twigs fixed on the top is found on the summit of almost every pass and represents the pass-deity.\n\nMany of the forest trees are believed to be the abode of evil spirits. The Banbirs\u2014deified heroes or champions of the olden times\u2014are said to live in the pomegranate, lime, tun, fig, karith, simbal and walnut trees. They also frequent precipices, waterfalls and cross-roads, and are propitiated on special occasions at these various spots. They are credited with the power to cause sickness especially in women; and some of them, as for example Kala Bir and Narsingh, are said to have amorous proclivities and to visit women in the absence of their husbands. If the husband returns while the Bir is in human form he is sure to die unless a sacrifice is offered. Kehlu Bir lives on the mountain slopes and when unappeased rolls landslips down into the valley. The Banasats are female spirits living in forests and on high mountain slopes, and are regarded as the guardians of cattle. For this reason they are propitiated when the village cattle are sent in summer to the grazing grounds. The Banasats also preside over quarries and rock cuttings and must be conciliated before operations are commenced. A goat must be slaughtered over the lime kiln before it is lit; and an offering is made to the Banasat before trees can be felled in the forest. The sportsman is admonished to appease the local devata with a goat if he wants to secure good sport, otherwise failure awaits him; and the grain cannot be ground at the grat (water-mill) without the consent of the Banasat.\n\nIn the same manner every river and stream is the habitat of a water spirit called Bir batil who also bears the Muhammadan name of Khwaja Khizr(2). The ancient name was Varuna, but how the change of name came about no one can say. The Minjaran ka mela, held yearly in Chamba, is\n\n(1) Raghubir is the name by which Rama, the deified hero of the Ramayana, is worshipped.\n(2) Vide Punjab Ethnography, 1851 paragraph 217.\nprobably a survival of the aboriginal worship of the river-god.(1) A bridge is regarded as likely to be unstable, unless a sacrifice has been offered\u2014and the opening of a kuhl or water-course requires the same kind of offering.\n\nThe Jaljogans inhabit wells, springs and streams, and are believed to have the power to cast a spell over women and children, causing sickness and death.\n\nIn addition to these, many other ghosts and hobgoblins, chiefly malevolent, are believed to have their dwelling in the hills. Chengu is a male spirit under the control of a sorcerer, whose messenger he is. He drinks the milk of cows and also carries it, with ghi, etc., to his master. Bahro is a male spirit of an ugly form who causes disease and must be appeased. Gungu is the protector of the cattle within the village cattle shed, just as Banasat is on the mountain grazing-grounds. The products of the cow are believed to be under the control of a special godling called Jakh, and every cow has its own Jakh, whose name is asked at the time of purchase, with a view to his requirements being properly met.\n\nBut the list is endless, for there is hardly anything the hillman does or attempts to do which is not under the control of one or other of the presiding genii of the mountains, without whose good will and favour all his efforts will be attended with failure; while the neglect of the customary offering may bring disaster on himself and his family. When sickness or calamity is believed to have been caused by any of these malevolent spirits the sick person, or some one for him, goes to the local chela who tells them which spirit ought to be appeased, and acts as the medium of cure. This he professes to do with the help of the godling whose chela he happens to be. All such diseases are called opari, that is, from supernatural influences\u2014as distinct from those that are sariri, or connected with the body.\n\nTree-worship(2) is by no means distinctive in the State: indeed it is doubtful if any tree but the pipal is really worshipped. As this tree does not grow much over 3,000 feet its worship is prevalent only in the lower and outer valleys. The Nag and Devi temples are frequently found in cedar groves, and then the Cedrus deodara is regarded as sacred, and may not be cut down. The tree itself, however, is not worshipped, nor is it looked upon as sacred unless when in proximity to a temple. The same is true of other trees which are believed to be the abode of malevolent spirits, such as the kainth, fig, pomegranate, etc. The tree is not worshipped, only the spirit residing in it. Even the shadow of these trees is injurious.\n\nSorcery and witchcraft are also very commonly believed in, though not to the same extent as in former times. Various kinds of disease are attributed to this cause, and witches are credited with the power to produce these diseases in others,\n\n---\n\n(1) Vide Festivals.\n(2) Even in the case of the pipal it is probably not the tree itself that is worshipped, but the spirits believed to reside in it. These are Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva in the trunk, the Devas in the roots, and the Rishis in the branches and leaves.\neither directly by their own incantations, or indirectly through the agency of one or other of the malevolent spirits which they bring under their control. Disease among cattle is also ascribed to witchcraft, and even the ravages of wild animals, such as leopards. Formerly when suspicion of witchcraft was aroused the relatives of the affected person went to Court or to the Raja and made a complaint. An order was then issued to a chela who had the reputation of being able to detect the witch in fault. Taking with him a g\u0101rri (player on a one-stringed instrument) and a doli (drummer) he proceeded to the place. A ghara full of water was first set on some grain spread on the ground and on this was placed a lighted lamp. Ropes were also made ready and laid beside the kumbh, as the ghara was called. While the musicians played, the chela worked himself into a state of afflatus, and addressing the people standing around he asked if they desired the witch to be caught, warning them that it might be a near relative of their own. They replied in the affirmative. This went on for three days. On the third day, standing beside the kumbh, the chela called out the name of the witch and ordered the attendants to go and seize her, and picking up the ropes they at once ran off to execute his orders and she was seized and bound. In olden times witches were subjected to cruel treatment to extort a confession of guilt. One of the methods was the same as that customary in some countries of Europe in former times. The witch was dipped in a pool of water, the belief being that if guilty, she would rise to the surface, and would sink if innocent. Guilt having been proved, the accused was banished to a distance, and sometimes her nose was cut off. For his services the chela received a fee of Rs. 12, part of which went to the State. Chelas are also believed to have the power to exorcise evil spirits by making the person afflicted inhale the smoke of certain herbs.\n\nThough the belief in witchcraft still survives, the detection of witches and all the cruel practices associated with it are now illegal, and have been entirely discontinued.\n\nThe following are some of the superstitions current among the people.\n\nWhen a child is born, a Brahman is consulted to ascertain its good or bad fortune, and if he says it has been born in a gandh mul or 'unlucky origin' the child is sometimes given away by its parents, under the idea that its presence will bring calamity upon them. If a child's upper front teeth appear first, it is a bad omen, and to avert the malign influence, the mother's parents must present something, e.g., a silver tooth, to the child. When starting on a journey if a Brahman or Damma is met, or any one bearing an empty ghara or killa, the omen is unfavourable, and the traveller turns back. If a child is met or a person bearing a full ghara the omen is favourable. For a journey or any work of importance a Brahman is consulted to ascertain the sit or lucky moment, and if the person is unable to start on the day and at the time fixed, his walking-stick or bundle is put outside the door, and this is looked upon as equivalent to his departure.\nThe months of Chet, Pao and M\u00e1gh are regarded as unlucky, and are called *k\u00e1le mah\u00edne* or black months. The people like to hear the name of Chet first from the lips of Dumnas; and the name of M\u00e1gh is best heard from a class of Brahmans called B\u00e1sb\u00e1re, who come during that month from the plains to sing and beg.\n\nAn infant should not be taken outside for the first time in these months, this being unlucky. If a cow has a calf in Bh\u00e1don, both it and the calf must be given away to avert misfortune. Sunday, Tuesday and Saturday are unlucky days for celebrating a marriage; if a marriage takes place on Sunday, the couple will not agree with one another; if on Tuesday, the husband will soon die; if on Saturday, there will be much sickness in the family.\n\nA woman must not wash her head on a Friday, or her brother will become sick. This is called *g\u00e1l lagdi*. Cowdung should not be offered to any one on a Friday, or the cow will become sick and its milk will dry up. On Wednesdays and birthdays nothing should be given away unless in the form of *d\u00e1n*, otherwise good luck will cease. A journey should not be begun on Sunday, Tuesday or Friday; but Monday, Wednesday and Thursday are lucky days for such a purpose, especially Wednesday. Sunday is good for entering on anything requiring haste.\n\nSaturn being a planet of bad omen, no oil should be put on the head on Saturday. On that day a little oil\u2014enough to see one\u2019s face in\u2014is put into the palm of the hand and then given to a Brahman. Some diseases are believed to be due to the malign influence of the planet Saturn, and to remove them *kicheri* (a mixture of *d\u00e1l* and rice with spices) is cooked and passed round the sick person\u2019s head and then given away; the idea being that the disease is thus transferred to the person who eats the *kicheri*.\n\nAgain, a woman should not wash her head on a Saturday, or her husband will become sick. There are five days in each month, called *panjak*, which are unlucky, and on them no work should be done. If work is in progress a holiday should be given, and no new work should be commenced on any of these days, or it will be attended with loss. If any one dies on one of the days of *panjak* cloth dolls, corresponding in number to the days still remaining, are made up and laid alongside the corpse and burnt with it, otherwise more members of the family will die. This custom is called *panjak sh\u00e1nti*. If a buffalo calves on a Wednesday it is unlucky, and the calf must be given away. A child born on a Tuesday will be attended with misfortune in the marriage state in after-life. There is also a special day in each year, called *gurb\u00e1r*, usually a birthday, on which no work must be done; the special day is indicated by a Pandit.\n\nIn Chamba the names of certain places are regarded as unlucky, and must not be mentioned in the morning. These are Nurpur, Basohli and Jammu. This prejudice doubtless arose in consequence of the frequent wars with these States in olden times. If it is necessary to refer to Nurpur the phrase \u201c*sapparw\u00e1la shahr*\u201d or \u2018the rocky town\u2019 is used; while Basohli and Jammu are spoken of as the \u201c*p\u00e1rla m\u00falk*,\u201d that is \u2018the country across the R\u00e1vi.\u2019\n\nThe belief in evil spirits exerts a powerful influence on the imagination of the people. Evil spirits and fairies are believed to have a special liking for fair complexioned children, and a black mark is put on the child\u2019s forehead to keep them away, and also to protect from the power of the evil eye. The underlying idea seems to be that these malign influences affect beauty more readily than ugliness; charms are also in general use to keep way\nbhute or evil spirits and the evil eye. These are made of leopards' and bears' claws, and the teeth of pigs; under the belief that as they belong to fierce animals they have the power to frighten away anything harmful. A cowrie, a shell or the bone of a crab is also regarded as having the same virtue. For the same reason brass anklets, called reh\u0101ru, are put on children. A person dying sansless is believed to become a bhut or autar-\u015bputra (sonless), and becomes a trouble to some of his living relatives, unless duly appeased. For this purpose a jantra is worn by adults, consisting of a small case of silver or copper containing a scroll supplied by a Brahman. An autar necklet made of silver with a human figure cut on it is also commonly worn. Another form is the n\u0101d, of silver or copper and shaped like an hour-glass. An autar must also be propitiated with the sacrifice of a goat, and the dead person's clothes are worn for a time by a member of the family\u2014a soapnut kernel is also worn hanging from a string round the neck. Iron about the person is believed to afford protection from evil spirits. If outside her house a woman should be careful not to bathe quite naked, as she is more liable to come under the shadow of an evil spirit. A child, whose jattu or first hair has not been cut, must not be taken to a mela, as the fairies who frequent such places may exert an evil influence. A piece of common thread netting hung above the doorway is believed to keep out evil spirits, during labour and in times of sickness.\n\nGood and bad omens are much regarded. If a chakor (partridge) cackles on the roof of a house, it forebodes the death of a member of the family. An owl sitting on the roof, or on a tree close by, portends calamity or misfortune. A chil or kite in similar circumstances is also a bird of evil omen. There are also bad omens in connection with cattle. If a cow lies down while being milked, or blood comes from the teats, the omen is bad and the animal must be sent away. A poisonous snake entering a house portends good, and the N\u0101g is regarded as specially auspicious. If killed in the house a snake must be removed by the window and not by the door, or a member of the family will die. If a cock crows in the evening it is killed at once, lest it should crow thrice, portending the death of a member of the family. Twin calves are unlucky. A white spot on a horse's forehead, called t\u0101ra, is unlucky for the purchaser of the animal. Hair growing the wrong way on the neck of a horse, called putha b\u0101l, is a bad omen, also a tuft of hair anywhere on the animal. White hair near the hoofs, and also on the forehead, called panjkalay\u0101ni is considered suspicious.\n\nAt the maize harvest four or five cobs on one stalk are regarded as a bad omen. If a snake crawls past a heap of grain, the grain must be given away. An injury to any one at the burning ghat is ominous, and an offering must be made to avert calamity. An adult sneezing at the commencement of any work or when starting on a journey is ominous, but good in the case of a young girl. The sight of a centipede means that some one is speaking evil of the person who sees it. A sudden tremor of one part of the body points to impending disease, and the side is touched with a shoe to counteract this evil influence. Itching of the palm of the right hand indicates coming wealth; and of the sole of the foot that a journey is near. Ringing in the right ear means pleasant news in prospect, and bad news if the ringing is in the left. If hiccup is slight some relative is thinking of you; if troublesome, some one is applying abusive epithets to you. If the eyelid quivers grief is near. A spider on the body means good clothing or a friend in prospect.\n\nIf a person dreams in the early morning the dream will come true. If in a dream a dead relative appears and mentions a date on which the person dreaming will die, some measures are taken to defeat this evil influence,\nA chela is called on the date mentioned, who dances, and he and the friends try in many ways to divert the man's attention till the critical time is past. The omen is inauspicious if in a dream copper or iron is given to the person dreaming. A dog coming towards the person to bite him is also ominous, and is called grah. An elephant in a dream means that Ganesh is angry and must be appeased. If a little child appears saying pleasant things Kali is benignant, but if something unpleasant is said, Kali needs to be appeased. If a boy appears, Mahadev is signified. A snake coming towards the dreamer to bite him is a bad omen. If some one is seen to leave the house the person dreaming will die, but if a living relative is seen dying he or she will recover. Crossing a stream in a dream points to some coming difficulty.\n\nIn sickness a sacrifice is often made for the sick person, in the belief that a life being given the life of the sick man will be preserved. When any one dies nails are driven into the ground near the corpse and its hands and feet are tied to them with a cord, in the belief that this prevents the body from lengthening and becoming a bhut or evil spirit. Sometimes a thorn is put at the place of cremation to prevent the spirit of the deceased from returning and troubling the living. The people believe that the spirit does return to its abode on the 10th or 13th day after death, and any unusual noise is taken as indicating its presence. If a child dics the mother is made to bathe over its grave, by having water poured over her through a sieve and this procedure is believed to secure offspring. The water used must be from a well or stream the name of which is of the masculine gender.\n\nIf a woman's children die after birth she is made to beg atta or flour from seven different houses. When the next child is born this atta is baked into a large cake, put on the tawa (gridiron), and cooked. A line is then cut with a knife all round and the central piece is lifted away leaving only a circular rim. Through this hole the newly born infant is passed seven times to ensure its living. Sometimes for the same reason a newly born child is passed seven times through the chula or fireplace. Another custom with the same object is to pierce the child's nostril immediately after birth and insert an iron nose ring. Sometimes in such circumstances an infant is given away to some poor person, and after a time taken back again, the idea seemingly being that this breaks the continuity of the bad luck. Another curious recipe for the same purpose is as follows:\u2014Take the bark of seven trees, and water from seven springs, of which the names are all of the masculine gender. Boil the bark in the water, and after dark let the liquid be poured over the woman at a cross-road. She then changes her clothes and gives away the suit she wore at the time of the ceremony, the idea being that the evil influence goes with the garments.\n\nA curious custom prevails in two places in the State, one in the Tariod pargana and the other in Hub\u00e1r. When a woman, owing to some evil influence, called parch\u00e1va, has no children or her children die, she goes to one or other of these places, and after performing some ceremonies she thrice creeps through a hole in a stone, artificially made and just large enough to admit of the passage of an adult, and then bathes, leaving one garment at the spot. This is believed to free her from the evil influence. Sunday morning is the proper time for doing this and Bh\u00e1don and M\u00e1gh are the best months. At Hub\u00e1r the bathing is done beside a Muhammadan nau gaza (nine yards long) grave.\n\nAncestor-worship is very common in the hills, the leading idea seeming to be that the dead acquire pun or merit from the pious\nact of the living, and are thereby enabled to rejoin their ancestors. The most common form which this worship takes is the erection of a stone or a wooden board, called pitr, in a small hut beside a spring, on which is cut a rough effigy of the deceased. This is accompanied by certain religious rites and a feast to the friends. Sometimes the board has a hole in it with a spout for the water and is then set up in the course of a stream. Other forms are the erection of a seat by the wayside for travellers to rest on, which may be of wood or stone; or a wooden enclosure in the village for the village sages, bearing in each case a roughly cut effigy of the deceased. One of the most common forms, especially in the Chandrabhaga Valley, is the erection of a monolith slab, called dhaji, in some spot near a village, with a rough figure of the deceased cut on it and a circular stone fixed on the top. Many of these stones may often be seen near a village, and correspond to the grave-stones in our cemeteries. Similar stone monuments seem to have been common among the aborigines, and are still found all through the Himalaya and also in Southern India. These memorial slabs are sometimes neatly carved, but as a rule they are very crude and rough. Their erection is accompanied by religious rites and feasting on a great scale, involving much expense, and these rites are repeated from time to time.\n\nAnother form which ancestor-worship often takes is to make a bridge over a stream in the name of a deceased person, or a road where there was none before; or to improve an existing but dangerous road, often by cutting steps in the rock. In each case the rough outline of a foot or of two feet is carved near the spot to indicate that the work was a memorial act.\n\nBut the most interesting and striking form which ancestor-worship assumed in these mountains in former times was the erection of a panihar or cistern. In its simplest form this consisted of a slab with a rough figure of the deceased carved on it, and a hole in the lower part, with a spout, through which the water flowed. This was set on its edge at a spring or in the line of a stream. Sometimes the slab was of large size and covered with artistic and beautifully executed carvings, either purely ornamental or representing scenes in Hindu mythology. These slabs may still be seen both in the R\u00e1vi and Ch\u00edn\u00e1b Valleys, occasionally in situ, but more frequently prostrate or half-buried in the ground. Some of them show long inscriptions in Sanskrit, usually containing the name of the person by whom the stone was erected, and other details of interest. For a full account of the principal inscriptions and the slabs on which they are engraved reference may be made to pages 52\u201455, and also to the Antiquities of Chamba, Vol. I.\n\n(1) Vide Vedic India, p. 289, also Hooper's Himalayan Journals, Vol. ii, p. 276, and Thurston's Ethnographic Notes pp. 150\u2014154.\n(2) Many of these inscribed slabs and other archaeological remains may be seen in the Bhuri Singh Museum at Chamba.\nThough now lying disused and neglected many of these slabs originally formed a part of elaborately finished water fountains of which the finest specimens are to be seen in Pangi, and the Chenab Valley, as low down as Kashtwar. The smaller ones are called panih\u00e1r and the larger ones, nahun. Many of them are remarkable for the great size of the stones and the massive appearance of the structure. They are found as a rule near a natural spring, or a stream from which a supply of water was directed to maintain a continuous flow from the water spouts. The nahuns are usually square or oblong in shape, closed in at the sides and back, but open in front. The roof is formed of two massive stone beams, reaching from side to side in front and behind, and over these flat slabs are laid, diagonally overlapping one another. The larger slabs are as much as 20 feet long, three feet broad, and two feet thick; in the smaller nahuns they range from six to twelve feet in length. The stone spouts are in the back wall and may be as many as ten in number. The most massive nahuns are found in the Bhutna N\u00e1l\u00e1 in P\u00e1dar but they have no inscriptions. The handling of such immense blocks of stone must have been a work of great difficulty. They had first to be quarried and dressed, and then dragged to the site of the fountain, which may have been some considerable distance away, and the drag-holes may still be seen in the ends of the stone. As many as 100 men were sometimes required for this purpose, and occasionally even the women had to be requisitioned. The erection of a panih\u00e1r or nahun was regarded as an important and auspicious occasion and was accompanied by certain religious rites; all who assisted being entertained at the expense of the builder. In most cases, as appears from the inscriptions, they were the work of the R\u00e1n\u00e1s or of wealthy zamind\u00e1rs. Some are still in a fair state of preservation, but most of them are now in ruins.\n\nThe aborigines of the Western Ham\u00e1laya probably belonged to both the Kolarian and Dravidian races, and their religion was a form of demonolatry and nature-worship from which have come many of the beliefs and practices prevalent in the hills at the present time.(1) The most essential feature of that religion was the worship of the earth in the form of both god and goddess as the giver and maintainer of life; and the adoration of the snake as the earth god's special emblem. The snake was also believed to have power over the wind and the rain.(2) They also worshipped the spirits and demons of the mountains, forests, rivers and springs, and the tutelary gods presiding over the clan and the family, many of which were believed to live in trees near the village, where sacrifices were offered to them. Ancestor-worship was prevalent, but this was not confined to the aborigines, being shared by the Aryan races as well. Lastly there was the form in which, among the Dravidians at least, this aboriginal worship culminated\u2014human\n\n(1) Vedic India, pp. 290-8.\n(2) Serpent-worship, by G. Staniland Wake, p. 64.\nsacrifice\u2014offered to the earth god at seed time and harvest, or when any special need arose. Snake charming and conjuring were also very common among those ancient peoples. This is practically a summary of what has been described in the preceding pages as being still the predominant religion of the hills. Snake worship we may therefore regard as certainly of aboriginal origin, while the Devi cult may be partly Aryan. The spirits of the mountain, forest, river and spring with ancestor-worship and many other forms of the aboriginal faith are still potent influences among the hillmen. Along with them may be classed Shivaism which, as Phallism associated with serpent-worship, was prevalent among almost all primitive peoples. It is found throughout the whole State, and some of the oldest temples belong to this cult. Vishnuism, on the other hand, though prevalent on the plains from an early period was not introduced into Chamba till the tenth century, and even at the present time exercises little influence outside the capital.\n\nOn their settlement in the hills the Aryans freely intermarried with the aborigines, resulting in the complete fusion of the two races, and the amalgamation of the two faiths. What happened is thus described by Mr. Crooke:\n\n\"This conquest of the older by the new creed followed the general lines of Aryan colonisation. It was by the absorption, rather than by the annihilation, of the local deities that Brahmanism triumphed. We hear of none of the persecution, none of the iconoclasm which characterised the Musalman inroad. A fitting home was found in the Brahmanic pantheon for the popular village deities\u2014the gods of fear and blood of the indigenous faith. Under these changed circumstances, and to meet the wants of the new Hindu people the Vedic theology was reconstructed. The vague nature deities of the older faith were gradually, and without any sudden dislocation of familiar traditions, modified into the supreme triad\u2014Brahma, the Creator; Vishnu, the Preserver; Siva, the Destroyer and Reproducer. The first two were, in name at least, in the Vedas; the last was assumed to represent Rudra, the Vedic storm-god. But the conception of Brahma was too abstract to suit the taste of converts reared in the traditions of a coarsely animistic faith. He has fallen out of popular regard. Vishnu by his successive incarnations has been made the vehicle for conciliating the tribal gods or totems of tribes now well within the pale of Hinduism. Siva as Mahadeva with his consort Kali, Devi or Durga, has swept up and absorbed most of the demonolatry of the indigenous servile races.\"\n\nThe Chamba Mission was founded in 1863 by the Rev. William Ferguson, a minister of the Church of Scotland; and was carried on by him as an independent Mission for ten years. In 1864 a valuable site was granted by Raja Sri Singh for the headquarters of the Mission, and on this site the Mission houses now stand.\n\nIn 1870, on Mr. Ferguson's departure to Scotland on furlough, his place was taken by Mr. E. Downes, an officer in the Royal\n\n(1) The North-Western Provinces of India by W. Crooke page 64.\nArtillery, who had resigned his commission for the purpose of engaging in mission work.\n\nMr. Ferguson returned to Chamb\u00e1 in 1872, but being again under the necessity of leaving India, the Mission was in the following year transferred to the Church of Scotland, and Dr. J. Hutchison was sent from Sialkot to take over charge.\n\nIn 1875 the Mission staff was reinforced by the arrival of Mr. Wellesley C. Bailey. He was, however, transferred to the plains in 1879. In 1884 the charge of the Mission was assumed by the Rev. William Walker, who continued to hold it till 1894. From that year till the present time, Dr. Hutchison has again been in charge.\n\nThe Mission is carried on by preaching, educational and medical missionary work.\n\nThe native church had a membership of 100 in 1907, including children, and is presided over by its own pastor.\n\nA handsome church was recently erected at his own cost by the late Raja Sham Singh, and gifted to the Mission for the use of the Christian community in Chamb\u00e1.\n\nThe Mission maintains a Middle School for boys, opened in 1876, and a Lower Primary School for boys and girls, opened in 1864. These schools have enjoyed a grant-in-aid from the Chamb\u00e1 State since 1877; and are subject to inspection. A Primary Boys' School is also maintained in Dalhousie during summer, for the sons of servants, shop-keepers, and others, and receives a grant-in-aid from the Municipality. The total attendance at these three Schools for 1907 was 147.\n\nA small dispensary was opened in Chamb\u00e1 in 1894, at which the total attendance in 1907 was 10,695, of whom 6,005 were new patients; and 392 major and minor operations were performed. Extensive medical missionary itinerations are carried on throughout the State, and in the adjoining Jammu territory.\n\nThe Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John have been translated into the Chamb\u00e1li dialect, and printed in the Takari character, for which purpose a printing press was set up at Ludhiana in 1881. This was the first occasion, on which these characters had been reduced to type. A First Reading Book with other literature has also been prepared and published.\n\nFemale Mission work is conducted in connection with the Women's Association for Foreign Missions of the Church of Scotland and is in charge of lady missionaries. There are two Schools of the Lower Primary standard for girls, one being for high caste Hindus, and the other for Muhammadans. In 1907 they had an attendance of 65. They receive a grant-in-aid from the Chamb\u00e1 State and are subject to inspection.\nZan\u00e1na work is also carried on in the town by the lady missionaries, and one of these, being a trained nurse, has frequent opportunities of ministering to the people in their own homes, in times of sickness. The ladies also itinerate among the villages.\n\nAlmost all the ordinary trades and avocations are represented in the capital. For masons and carpenters especially there is generally a great demand, and the wage rate of these two classes of artizans has risen considerably in recent years. They receive from ten annas to one rupee a day. Among them are often to be found men from the plains, who for one reason or another have settled in the hills.\n\nFew high class artizans are found outside the capital. In the rural tracts, as one would expect, the great bulk of the population are engaged in agricultural and pastoral pursuits, supplemented by rude home industries. Most of them hold land from the State, and those who do not themselves own land rent it from others, and are then called jhumriyalu. These may be of any caste. The occupations of the low castes have already been referred to under menial castes, (vide p. 163\u20145) and they are remunerated in kind by the zamindars at the spring and autumn harvests. Sometimes a small portion of land is assigned for their support in lieu of payment in kind. The following are the chief forms of farm service:\u2014\n\nThe H\u00e1lis engage in farm work, bury dead animals and act as tailors; the Loh\u00e1rs work in iron and also weave pattu\u2014the coarse woollen material used by the villagers for clothing. All wood work is done by the B\u00e1dhis or carpenters. The Cham\u00e1rs supply shoes, and the Sippis do sewing and weaving. The Dums or Dumnas are the basketmakers and village bards, and the Barw\u00e1las prepare matting and winnowing fans. The Kumh\u00e0rs make pottery; the Dos\u00e1lis provide leaf cups and plates, while the Reh\u00e1ras and Sareras supply ankle ornaments and wooden bowls.\n\nAnother workman of some importance in the hills is the Batera (batta, a stone)\u2014half mason, half carpenter, and often a man of high caste\u2014by whom the village houses, shrines and other buildings are erected. He too is often paid in kind, but if in cash his wage is less than that of the artizans in the capital.\n\nAlmost all the women in the villages, except those belonging to good families, engage in field labour in addition to their ordinary household duties; and in P\u00e1ngi the women do all the field work except the ploughing and sowing. Few of the women in the villages are able to sew, most of this work being done by the men.\n\nDuring the winter months many of the villagers, especially the Gaddis, come down to the capital, where they can earn a little money by coolie labour; returning to their homes in spring. In summer a considerable number find employment as janp\u00e1nis, and in other capacities, in Dalhousie; as coolies and sawyers in the\nAs most of the people of the State live in the villages, it is there we must look for a picture of their social life. There is much that is interesting about a village in the hills, though the insanitary surroundings detract a good deal from that interest. For most of the year the hill village is a scene of great activity, the kind of work varying with the season and also, to a certain extent with the wiz\u00e1rat in which the village is situated. In the Bhattiy\u00e1t wiz\u00e1rat, and also in the lower parts of the Sadr and Chur\u00e1h wiz\u00e1rats under 6,000 feet, there are two harvests. In the other parts of the State only one harvest as a rule is possible. In the early spring the ground is manured and prepared for the maize and kodra crops, which are sown first. The rice beds are also got ready and the rice is transplanted in H\u00e1\u0159. The wheat and barley crops are reaped in Bais\u00e1kh, having been sown in the late autumn and lain all winter under the snow. Massar k\u00e1 d\u00e1l is sown with the wheat and also reaped about the same time. A great deal of weeding has to be done in connection with the maize, kodra, d\u00e1l, and rice crops, but not with the others. In the higher up-lands phullan and bres are sown in S\u00e1wan and grow quickly, being ready for cutting in Asuj or K\u00e1tak. The rice, maize, and kv\u00e1ra are all out about the same time, usually in Asuj or later according to altitude. About the same time the farmers begin to prepare the ground for the spring crops, which are sown in the autumn, and a little later in Bhattiy\u00e1t than in the other wiz\u00e1rats.\n\nAs winter approaches, the farmers in the R\u00e1vi and Chin\u00e1b valleys begin, in Asuj, to lay in a store of fodder for their cattle, and of this there is an abundant supply on the higher slopes where no cultivation is possible. This is brought in and dried on the house roof and stored in sheds, or in the forks and branches of trees near the village. Fuel has also to be laid in for winter use, where the snowfall is heavy, as in the Brahmaur, P\u00e1ngi and some parts of the Sadr and Chur\u00e1h wiz\u00e1rats. In the Bhattiy\u00e1t wiz\u00e1rat this is unnecessary. The flour for winter consumption must also be ground at the water-mills, to save the labour of doing it by hand, and all other necessaries are carefully provided both for man and beast. In P\u00e1ngi, even earth for cleaning the floor is stored, as none can be procured in winter.\n\nWhile the men are busy with these and other duties the village women are not idle. In addition to their ordinary household work, such as cooking, spinning and tending their children, they also herd the cattle, and some of them may be away in the jungle all day on this duty. They are helped by the village boys and girls as soon as they are old enough. At harvest time the\nwomen work in the fields, and assist in the reaping and winnowing of the grain, this latter work being done mostly on the saran or roof. In connection with the rice crop especially, a great deal of hard work falls to their share. When the time for transplanting arrives, they may be seen standing knee deep in water, day after day, till the work is done. It is an occupation, however, which they seem to enjoy, for they sing merrily as they toil, and make much fun for themselves by splashing the muddy water over each other, or any one else who goes near them. The weeding, too, is a work in which the village women bear a full share, as also the grass-cutting and hay-making, and in autumn they may be seen, sickle in hand, on the mountain slopes, busily engaged in providing fodder for the winter. In Pangi the women do most of the out-door work excepting only the ploughing and sowing.\n\nIn some parts of the State the winter is very severe. The people of the Bhattiy\u00e1t, Sadr and Chur\u00e1h wiz\u00e1rats are able to move about all the year round, unless, perhaps, for a few days at a time in the higher villages, but in Pangi and L\u00e1hul this is not so. There the winter is so rigorous that the people are to a large extent confined to their houses. After October or November the upper storey is too cold to live in, and they descend to the lower storey, which is warmer, and remain there till spring sets in. But even then there is no cessation of labour. The men are kept busy tending the cattle, spinning yarn, and clearing the snow off the roof. Pattu is also woven and clothes are made for the family, as well as ropes and thobis (carpets) from goat's hair, for use or sale in the coming summer.\n\nSometimes a break in the wintry weather makes it possible to visit a neighbouring village, but the roads are too dangerous owing to avalanches for any one to venture far from home. They move about, however, within the circuit of their own village when the snow is hard and crisp. As spring approaches they pile earth on the remaining heaps of snow in the fields to clear them for ploughing. The women too are kept busy all winter. Their duties consist of ordinary in-door work, such as caring for their children, cooking, and bringing water, for which snow must be melted. Their spare time is occupied in teasing out and cleaning wool, and spinning it into yarn. They also prepare a good supply of grass shoes for the family during the coming summer. In the Brahmaur wiz\u00e1rat similar conditions prevail, but the winter is milder. There, however, a general exodus takes place every autumn, most of the inhabitants migrating either to the lower R\u00e1vi valley or K\u00e1ngra, where they pass the winter, returning in the spring. The few who remain, by pre-arrangement, take care of the cattle, and are remunerated according to custom.\nThe usual divisions of time are as follows:\n\n| Time Division | Description |\n|---------------|-------------|\n| Biy\u00e1gl\u00e1 pahar | A couple of hours before sunrise. |\n| Munhanera     | Early dawn. |\n| Jusmusa       | Dawn. |\n| Bh\u00ed\u00e1g         | Sunrise. |\n| Kalw\u00e1r        | About 9 or 10 A.M. |\n| Dopahar       | Noon. |\n| Triya pahar   | About 3 P.M. |\n| Chautha pahar | About 4 P.M. |\n| Sanj          | Sunset. |\n| Nimos\u00e1m       | Twilight. |\n| Gundulka      | Almost dark. |\n| Kallel        | After dark. |\n| Adhr\u00e1ta       | Midnight. |\n\nIn the capital the people, unless the very poor, live better than those in other parts of the State. Their food consists of milk, tea, bread, d\u00e1l, vegetables, animal food and rice, with such dishes as palao, curry and rice, &c. In Bhattiy\u00e1t rice is extensively grown, and as a rule the people fare better than in the other wiz\u00e1rats. The people of Chur\u00e1h and Brahmaur have little variety in their diet. Animal food is a luxury as also rice. Maize is the staple food of the farmers, and is baked into cakes and eaten with d\u00e1l, vegetables, milk, &c. Wheat and barley flour are also used, also chinai, which is cooked like rice. In P\u00e1ng\u00ed and L\u00e1hul the people eat barley, elo (rye), wheat, buckwheat, suil, chinai. Part of the straw is ground with the grain and eaten, also a kind of grass called kangash in times of scarcity. Sattu is made of parched suil, elo or barley. Barley, elo, phullan, and bres are ground into meal for bread; also wheat, of which, however, not much is used. As maize does not grow in the valley or only to a small extent, it enters little into the diet of the people. The roti is cooked in the usual way, sometimes with oil or ghi, and walnut oil is used for burning and cooking purposes. Flesh is eaten chiefly in winter, being too dear for common use. Sag, d\u00e1l, and potatoes are much used. The last were introduced into P\u00e1ng\u00ed about 1878 by Mr. R. T. Burney, Superintendent of the State, and are now very extensively grown. As a rule the people of P\u00e1ng\u00ed and L\u00e1hul do not fare so well as those of the R\u00e1v\u00ed valley. They drink a good deal in winter, the liquor being brewed from the elo, a kind of rye.\n\nThe zamindars eat three times a day. The morning meal is called nuh\u00e1ri, that at midday dopai or rasoi, and the supper is r\u00e1t ki roti. Nuh\u00e1ri consists of bread. At noon either bh\u00e1t (boiled rice) or bread is eaten, and for supper boiled rice or bread as means permit. Well-to-do people eat rice, wheat, maida, basmati rice, tea, meat, milk, &c. Poor people eat makki, kodra, barley, rice, and wheat according to their means and opportunity. In P\u00e1ng\u00ed and L\u00e1hul no rice is used.\n\nEach wiz\u00e1rat has its own peculiar and characteristic costume, by which the people of that wiz\u00e1rat can generally be recognised without difficulty.\nSadr wiz\u00e1rat.\u2014In the capital, as one would expect, a great variety in the way of dress may be seen, but there is a special costume peculiar to the town, and found nowhere else. Among Hindus there is the old style called angrakha, now seen only among the more aged men. This is a long tunic reaching below the knees, with a cloth waist-band, tight paijamas, and a small pagri set on the top of the head. This style of dress is peculiar to the town, but is rapidly disappearing. The younger men, and especially the educated classes, now dress in much the same way as the same classes on the plains.\n\nAmong the women the distinction is more marked, there having been practically no change in their attire in recent years. Hindu women wear a gown with a short bodice reaching to the waist, and below this the skirts fall away in numerous folds, almost touching the ground. This is called a pashw\u00e1j. The folds are sometimes so full as to measure 100 yards in circumference, and 30 or 40 yards are common. The pashw\u00e1j is worn only out of doors and on special occasions. For ordinary wear a pairdhan is used. On the head is a chadd\u00e1r or dopatta of any material which the wearer can afford: paij\u00e1mas, called suthan, are also worn, and leather shoes for the feet. Muhammadan women wear the same sort of dress, but it is not so long, nor so heavy and some wear a short tunic reaching only to the knees. Under the bodice is a small vest called angi, and some wear a small shirt or kurta. Ornaments are worn, especially nose and ear-rings, armlets, and anklets, but these are not in general use unless at marriages or on gala days. They also wear necklets, and chains for the forehead.\n\nIn the villages of the Sadr wiz\u00e1rat, the dress varies considerably and there is none that is distinctive. In the south it is similar to that of Brahmaur and in the north to that of Chur\u00e1h.\n\nBrahmaur.\u2014The costume of the Gaddis, both men and women is characteristic and striking. The old head-dress of the men is of a peculiar shape, with a flap round the margin, and a peak-like projection in the centre, said to represent the Kail\u00e1s of Mani Mahes. The flap is tied up for ordinary wear, but let down over the ears and neck in time of mourning and also in severe weather. The front is often adorned with dried flowers or beads. This style of head-dress is falling into disuse, unless on special occasions, its place being taken by the pagri. On the body a pattu coat, called chola, is worn reaching below the knees. It has a deep collar, which hangs loose in two lappets in front, and in the sewing the wearer stows away various articles, such as needle and thread, pieces of paper and twine. The chola is tightened round the waist by means of a black rope worn as a waist-band. This is made of sheep\u2019s wool and is called dora. The coat is loose above the waist-band, and in this receptacle the Gaddi carries many of his belongings. A shepherd on the march may have four or\nfive lambs stowed away in his bosom, along with his daily food and other miscellaneous articles. The legs are generally bare, but many wear pattu paijamas, loose to the knees for freedom of sitting and walking; but fitting tight at the lower part of the leg and ankle where it rests in numerous folds. Shoes are in common use for the feet. From the girdle there hangs a knife, a flint box and steel for striking a light, and a small leather bag, in which the wearer carries his money and other small articles of every-day requirement. The hill people are fond of flowers, and in the topi or payri may often be seen a tuft of the wild flowers of the season, red berries, or other ornament. The chief ornament is the tabit, a square silver plate of varying size covered with carving and hung from the neck.\n\nThe Gaddi women wear a dress similar to that of the men, made of pattu and called cholu. It hangs straight like a gown from the neck to the ankles, and round the waist is the woollen cord or dora. A cotton gown of a special pattern is now common, and is called ghundu. It is worn in the same way as the cholu. The head is covered with a chadar, and the legs and feet are bare. The Gaddi women wear their own special ornaments, the chief of which is the galasari, and sometimes the tabit, similar to that worn by the men. They also wear heavy brass anklets, called ghunkure which are special to the Gaddi women(1).\n\nThe Gaddis say that they assumed the garb of Shiva and Parvati when they settled in Brahmaur which they call Shiv-bhumi or Shiv\u2019s land.\n\nIn the Bhattiyat wisarat the dress of both men and women is practically the same as that of Kangra.\n\nChurah.\u2014The men wear a coat of pattu similar in some respects to that of the Gaddis, but not so long nor so well finished. The dora is not worn, and instead of it a cloth waist-band is common, while some have no kamarband. On the head is a round cap or a pagri. The paijamas are loose above and tight at the legs and ankles, but not puckered up into folds as in Brahmaur. Leather shoes, or shoes made of the bark of the mahinda tree, are commonly used. The Churahis do not wear many ornaments unless on gala days. The women wear on their heads a small cloth cap called jajji with a long tail hanging down the back, and for the body a short bodice, named choli, reaching to the waist. The lower garment is a blanket fixed round the loins with a cloth kamarband, and hanging in folds to the ankles. They usually have shoes for the feet. As regards ornaments these are worn in the ears, (ba\u00efi), in the nose (balu), on the neck (lau), and on the forehead (jiniri) all of silver; armlets and anklets are also worn.\n\nPangi\u2014There the men wear a pattu coat reaching to the\n\n(1) Brass anklets called rekha, are worn by Gaddi children to ward off the evil eye, and to prevent the child from crying. They are made by the members of a mental caste, named Behria.\nknees with a kamarband of cloth, often coloured. The p\u0101ij\u0101mas are also of pattu, loose above, and tight below, with puckers at the leg and ankle. A small cotton cap is worn on the head, and grass shoes, called pull\u0101n, on the feet. A blanket is used like a plaid in cold weather, and pattu socks in winter and when walking on snow. The P\u0101ngi men wear few ornaments unless on special occasions. The original dress of the women consists of one blanket, which is wound round the body in a peculiar and not ungraceful manner. One end is brought over the left shoulder, and the blanket is then passed behind the back, under the right arm, and across the breast, where it is fixed to the end hanging over the left shoulder by a large brass pin. It then passes under the left arm and across the back, to the front of the right shoulder, where it is fastened with another brass pin. The ends hang down in front from each shoulder. Grass shoes are worn, but the arms and legs are often bare. On the head a small cap similar to that of the men is worn, except that it is always coloured. Little balls are often attached to the brass pins. In winter a second blanket is worn over the under one, and put on in the same way, also pattu p\u0101ij\u0101mas and socks. Sometimes a coloured kamarband is worn.\n\nAn older cap of thick pattu is worn by some of the middle aged women, but young women have discarded it. It is circular in shape with a round top, flat and red in colour. The hair is parted in the middle and plaited into a pig tail, with a tassel at the end which hangs down the back. It is becoming customary for women who can afford it, especially those who have been to Chamb\u0101, to wear cotton p\u0101ij\u0101ma, called s\u016bhan. Ornaments are worn in the ears and on the neck, also bracelets if means permit, but they are not displayed unless on special occasions. Great changes in dress are taking place in P\u0101ngi, owing to free intercourse with Chamba.\n\nLahul.\u2014The men wear a pattu coat reaching almost to the knees and usually of a dark colour. A cloth kamarband is common and fairly loose p\u0101ij\u0101mas of the same material as the coat. For the head they have a small black pattu cap, turned up at the rim, and grass shoes with leather soles on the feet. The dress of the women is similar to that of the men, with some personal adornment in the way of ornaments on the head and neck. The cap is smaller with a red top and the coat often has a red stripe down each side. The hair is plaited and hangs down the back, with a tassel or some shells attached to the end.\n\nIn recent years great changes have taken place in the dress of the people not only in the capital, but throughout the whole of the R\u0101vi valley.\n\nThe following is a list of ornaments worn by men in Chamba: kantha or necklace; kangan or bracelet; bauhnta, worn round the arms; b\u0101la, or ear-ring, chhalla (anguthi) or finger ring; murki, or ear-ring; m\u0101la or neck garland. Women wear as many ornaments as they can afford, especially on gala days, e.g., b\u0101li, jhumki.\nand pharalu, for the ears; chauk for the head; bindli, for the brow; bali, balak, chatki, latkan for the nose; mala and chaumpkali for the neck; sambh for the breast; kangan, gokhru, ponchi, chura, for the wrist; band for the forearm; drsi for the thumb; chhalla for the fingers; pazela, kari and phulla for the feet, ankles and toes.\n\nThose who have no ornaments borrow them from others if they can; if not, they wear such clothes and ornaments as they can afford. Coloured clothes are not worn in mourning, dirty clothes being worn, and women take off all ornaments except the kangan or bracelet.\n\nThe capital has been almost transformed in more recent years by the extensive building operations carried out by the State and private persons. The new houses in the town are better built, and greater regard is paid to ventilation and light. Windows are now considered essential, and more care is taken by the people to make their homes sanitary. The dangers resulting from damp are more fully realised and guarded against. Most of the houses in the town are two and three storeys high, and all the newer ones are roofed with slates. As a rule the floor is of mud, unless in the houses of the better classes, where wooden floors are common. The cooking is usually done in the bhor or upper storey. The general plan in building is a square round a central court-yard, but this plan is adhered to only where the house is large. As a rule, however, each house has its own court-yard in front, even when the more general plan has not been possible. The furniture varies in quantity and quality with the social position of the occupant. Among the better classes some of the rooms will be in English style. Among the poorer classes few articles of furniture are found beyond the bare necessaries of life, but the houses are generally neat and clean. The sanitary arrangements of the town as a whole are satisfactory.\n\nThere is considerable variety in the way of furniture in the different wiz\u00e1rats, but all are alike in this respect that everything is of the simplest kind. A charpai or two will usually be found in every house, except in P\u00e1ngi where they are not in common use. Cooking utensils and other vessels for food, of earthenware or brass according to the means of the family, are an essential part of the household equipment. The arrangements for storing grain are peculiar. In Bhattiy\u00e1t a large earthenware barrel is common; sometimes this receptacle is of wicker work smeared with mud, called dandu, and this variety is also in use in the Sadr and Chur\u00e1h wiz\u00e1rats. Wooden boxes of an oblong shape and different sizes are also common in all the wiz\u00e1rats except Bhattiy\u00e1t. They are called tuni and kanjal in the Ravi valley, and shik\u00e1ri and kanchar in P\u00e1ngi. Farming implements are often seen hanging on the walls. Baskets and boxes for clothing are also indispensable. In Bhattiy\u00e1t the older kind of box for clothes is made\nof earthenware, called mattan, but wooden boxes are now coming into general use. Lastly a hand-mill (chakki) for grinding grain will usually be found in every house and also a winnowing-fan (chhaj), and a spinning wheel (charkha).\n\nWhen a sick man is approaching death and there is no hope of his recovery, his relatives gather round him and persuade him to give, in the name of charity, all kinds of food-grains, oil, ghi, gur, cotton, fruits, sweetmeats and even more substantial things, such as couches, shoes, umbrellas, and so forth, according to the status of the sufferer. A cow, especially, is considered an indispensable gift on the part of a sick man, if he can possibly afford it, during the death agony. If there is no cow convenient, the price of one may be given instead. This charity is usually received by Gujarati Brahmans. It is called antrishthi, i.e., the offering made at the time of death. When this ceremony has been performed, til and kusha (a kind of grass) are spread over the floor, the sick man's bed is placed above them, and the sick man himself laid on the bed face upward and his feet towards the south. Then he is made to listen to the path (or recital) of the Gita, and the Ganga jal (water of the Ganges) is given him to drink. In the last moments tulsi patta (leaves of the tulsi, a sacred tree) and the panjratni (lit. five metals, \u2014gold, silver, copper, pearl and coral) are placed in his mouth, and when he breathes his last he is bathed, dressed in fine clothes, and, if a married man, the sehra (a woven net of flowers worn on the wedding day) is placed on his head.\n\nAll the members of his family, his relatives and his friends gather round the corpse and each person lays thereon a shroud. The widow walks round the body, and then putting some metal (a rupee or a pice) beneath the feet, bows down her head towards them and falls on them. Then comes the ceremony of pind dan, which is performed by the dead man's son, or, in the absence of a son, by some near relative.\n\nThe dead body is placed on a sheet of wooden planks made for the purpose called bahwan. The planks are covered with a red cloth and decorated with flags and flowers. All the women gather round and make a loud and prolonged \"keening\" over the corpse and beat themselves with their hands. The younger male members of the family shave their heads and faces, and then carry the body to the burning gh\u0101t, accompanied by the relatives and neighbours. Women do not go to a funeral. On the way almonds, raisins, and pice are thrown from behind over the bier. Conch shells and bells are sounded during the journey, and if possible the Dumnas supply music of other sorts, but the shells and bells are indispensable. The bier is occasionally laid on the ground to give the bearers a rest. At each stop the pind dan is again performed and the \"keening\" renewed. This occurs for the last time when the procession reaches the gh\u0101t, which is always\n\n(1) Pind dan is a ceremony performed, at the instance of the panchit outside the house before the corpse is taken away. The panchit recites Sanskrit verses.\non the bank of a river. The body by this time has been placed on the funeral pyre. The son, or other person performing the pind d\u0101n, and the near relatives take small pieces of wood (usually of deodar), light them, and walk round the pyre, and then the performer of the pind d\u0101n applies his torch at the head of the deceased, the other relatives following his example at the feet and sides. All present then throw wood on the pyre and all, save the members of the deceased\u2019s family, return home. The latter remain until the body has been completely burned. They then gather the bones and ashes, which they subsequently bring to the house. Before going, however, they wash away the remains of the pyre and bathe themselves in the river. All who accompany a funeral are obliged to bathe before again mixing with the world. The women perform their ablutions indoors and the whole house is purified with gobar (cow-dung).\n\nBrahmans remain for ten days in mourning, R\u0101jp\u016bts for twelve and Khatr\u012bs for fourteen, after the day of death. When this period is over the ceremony of kiria karm is performed. There are two sorts of kiria karm; the first is called brikhod surg, and on that day articles, such as clothes, ornaments, and domestic utensils, are bestowed in charity. The proper recipient of these is a Brahman who is called Ach\u0101raj. The second sort of kiria karm is called suphandi, and on that day charitable offerings are made to a Brahman called Goh\u0101lu. The Ach\u0101raj and Goh\u0101lu are male or female according to the sex of the deceased. On the day of kiria the Ach\u0101raj is dressed up in all the clothes bestowed in charity, and loaded with the ornaments so given. On the conclusion of these ceremonies the performer of the pind d\u0101n and the other near relatives go to some temple of Vishnu and drink there the charnamrit (the sacred water from the bath of Th\u0101kur). This ends the mourning period, and the relatives may then resume their ordinary avocations and religious duties. They are strictly debarred from the latter during the days of mourning. The bones of the deceased (called phul, i.e., flowers, or ash, i.e., bones) are sent to the Ganges. It does not matter whether they are carried by one of the family or by a Brahman paid for the duty.\n\nThe hill people are merry and light-hearted, and with them sports and pastimes are more general than among the people of the plains. Almost all of them are fond of dancing, there being no social restrictions as elsewhere, and each wiz\u0101rat of the State has its own peculiar style. In Bhattiy\u0101t alone is dancing discomfited. Men and women always dance apart. The women\u2019s dance is called ghorai. Forming themselves into two groups, they move in a circle, swaying the body half way round at each step in an easy and graceful manner, with the arms alternately over the head and hanging down. One of their number acts as leader. The dancing is accompanied by singing, the song being sometimes amorous, but often a metrical setting of some\nold legend or tradition. The two groups sing alternately, repeating the same words.\n\nThe dancing of the men is vigorous, and even boisterous, especially among the Gaddis. A dancer will sometimes continue to wheel round so long, that he at last drops down from giddiness. At all the village melas dancing is an essential part of the procedure, and is often accompanied with drinking. The town people do not dance, and regard the practice with disfavour.\n\nWrestling for amusement is very common among the hill folk, all through the State, and especially in the Chur\u00e1h, Sadr and Bhattiyat wizarats. In most of the pargan\u00e1s of these wizarats there is a yearly wrestling match called chhinj. On the appointed day the people flock to the meeting place from far and near, and all being seated in order on the green sward, the wrestling begins to the sound of music. When it is finished, prizes are distributed to the victors, and the people disperse to their homes.\n\nDaurna, or running, is another common form of sport.\n\nMugdar pherna.\u2014The mugdar is a section of a tree trunk, about one and a half feet long, with a handle cut in the side. It is quite a mauld in weight, and is raised with one hand, and held at arms length, or poised over the head, a feat which none but a strong man is capable of. Mogari, or Indian clubs, are also sometimes seen.\n\nChhal\u00e1ng m\u00e1rna, or jumping, and patihar sutna, or \"putting the stone,\" are also common.\n\nKhinnu, or hockey, is a game of ancient origin in the hills, and every town has its own chaug\u00e1n or hockey ground. The hockey goal-stones were to be seen on the Chaug\u00e1n at Chamba, till removed some years ago in the course of improvements. When polo was played at the Mughal Court it was also probably in vogue in the hills, but there is no tradition of this in Chamba. Its Persian name is chaug\u00e1n, but this is quite a distinct word etymologically from the word in use in the hills, which is of Sanskrit origin, and means four-sided.\n\nGames of Chance.\u2014These are Shatranj, chess; T\u00e1sh, cards Chonpar, dice; and Chhakri. The last game is played with cowries on a cross figure, marked on wood, stone, or the ground. To these may be added Goli khelna and Gatti khelna, both of which are played with pice, or coins of larger value, and are akin to gambling.\n\nBoys' games.\u2014Of these the following are the more common:\n\nChuh-chuh\u00e1n\u00ed.\u2014This is similar to the Scotch game of Tig. From among a company of boys one takes his place in the centre, his object being to touch any one of the others, all of whom try to avoid him. The boy touched must take his turn in the middle.\nHudu bharna:\u2014A boy stands on one foot, and tries to hop a specified distance without letting the other foot touch the ground. If unsuccessful he must begin again.\n\nKabaddi.\u2014Two bands of boys confront each other, a line being drawn between them. Any boy may cross this line, and try to touch a boy of the opposing side, who is thereby put out of the game. All the time he is across the line he continues to call \"Kabaddi.\" If caught before he can return to his own side; he is out.\n\nGuli danda.\u2014A small piece of wood, one inch long, and pointed at both ends, is laid on the ground, and struck near one end with a stick so as to make it rise into the air. It is then struck a second time and sent to a distance. This game, too, is played in sides.\n\nGindi-br\u00e1g.\u2014Similar to the game of \"Hen and Chickens.\" In a company of boys one is a shepherd, one a leopard, several are dogs, and the remainder sheep. The shepherd goes before, and the sheep follow bleating. Suddenly the leopard tries to seize one of the flock, who is rescued by the dogs.\n\nLuk-luk\u00e1ni.\u2014\"Hide and Seek.\" This is played in much the same way as the English game. Dhilo is another form of Hide and Seek, usually played at night.\n\nAkh-mit\u00e1ni.\u2014\"Blind man's buff.\" It is played in much the same manner as the English game.\n\nOhiunkal.\u2014A plank is balanced on the top of an upright support, and a boy leans on each end. The plank is then made to swing round.\n\nKal\u00e1i-chhur\u00e1na.\u2014The wrist is firmly caught by some one, and has to be forcibly released.\n\nOther games are Ping jhutna, swinging, Patang-ur\u00e1na, kite flying; Gulel, slinging as with a bow and arrow, a stone taking the place of the arrow.\n\nGirls' games.\u2014Some of the above-mentioned games are played by girls as well as boys, as chuh-chuh\u00e1ni, luk-luk\u00e1ni, akh-mit\u00e1ni, ping jhutna. Girls also play khinnu with a ball, which is kept rebounding from the ground as long as possible, the player repeating a formula all the time.\n\nDode.\u2014This is played with five soap-nuts, one being in the hand and the rest on the ground. One is thrown into the air, and the rest picked up, and the first caught before it can reach the ground. Ghor-puna\u2014two girls swing round with a grasp of each other's hands, the feet being in contact.\n\nA large part of the social life of the Hindus in Chamba is connected with their festivals and melas which are many and varied. The following is a description of some of the chief of these:\n\n1. Bais\u00e1khi or Basoa.\u2014This festival is held on 1st Bais\u00e1kh, the Hindu New Year's day. Earthenware pots (gharas) full of water\nare placed on some grain strewn on the floor with other fruits of the season. After puja by a priest these are given, in name of the pitrs (ancestors) to Brahmans or to a sister's children.\n\n2. Hori.\u2014This is held from 1st Baisakh with the same observances as are customary during the Holi. For some reason these observances seem to have been discontinued at the regular time, and a separate mela instituted, called Hori, which is unknown on the plains. Possibly a Raja may have died while the Holi was going on, or a later date was adopted owing to the unsuitableness of the season at which the Holi is held. The Hori used to be held with much more enthusiasm than it is now. The rough play began in the palace, and was adjourned first to the public gardens, and then to the Chaugan. A pile of coloured flour having been prepared, small bags were filled with it, and each player had a supply with which he pelted his neighbours. The players were either on foot or horseback, and the play went on for several days, not only young, but also middle aged men joining in it.\n\n3. Somavati Amavas.\u2014The new moon falling on a Monday, women go round the pipal tree a certain number of times with fruit.\n\n4. Puran mashi or Punya of Sat Nardin.\u2014This is a fast and is observed at every full moon. The family purohit recites the story of Sat Narain, and people present sweetmeats to him, some of which he keeps, and the rest he returns, and this is called purshad or a holy thing. Newly born infants are taken out to look at the first full moon after birth, this being regarded as lucky.\n\n5. The Yatras.\u2014These are twenty-one in number, and continue from 1st to 21st Baisakh. One day is added for every heir-apparent born to a Raja after his accession, provided the child lives till the next mela comes round. They were more strictly observed in past times than now. On each day it was the custom for the Raja, or his deputy, to visit in fixed order certain temples in the town, starting from the Palace, and returning to the Champavati Temple. Thereafter wrestling took place daily on the Chaugan in the presence of the Court. On the last day a Durbar was held, at which prizes were distributed. The Yatras are closed with an amusing ceremony. An old man appears in soiled garments, with a cage on his head containing a cat, a bow and arrow in one hand, and a piece of paper in the other. Coming forward in a manner fitted to excite the mirth of the onlookers, he hands the paper to the Raja or his deputy, and putting down the cage lets out the cat. As it runs away he pretends to shoot an arrow after it, and this is the signal for the mela being at an end. During this mela the devi of Devi Kothi in Baira and Lundi in Dhundi are brought to Chamba on a visit to the Chaund and Champavati devis, all of whom are believed to be sisters. They remain till the Yatras are over.\n6. **N\u00e1g-panjam\u00ed**.\u2014This is held on the fifth day of the dark half of Jeth and seems to be a form of snake worship. Men draw pictures of snakes in their houses and worship them. They also cook *khir* and *mahiri*, and give them to the Brahmans and to their own relatives. *Khir* is rice and milk with sugar, and *mahiri* is made of butter-milk and rice, with salt.\n\n7. **Nirjala Ek\u00e1dashi**.\u2014Held on the 11th day of the light half of the moon, in Jeth or H\u00e1. It is observed as a fast, and falls in the dry beat before the beginning of the rains. People give *sharbat* to one another and eat *phulan*, *suil*, fruits, &c.\n\n8. **Sankr\u00e1nt of As\u00e1r or H\u00e1**.\u2014Falls on the first of H\u00e1, called also *S\u00edle Suh\u00e1le k\u00ed Sankr\u00e1nt*. Starch is cooked with sugar and *gh\u00ed* by the people, and distributed among their friends.\n\n9. **S\u00e1wan k\u00ed Sankr\u00e1nt or Bars\u00e1l\u00e9 k\u00ed Sankr\u00e1nt**.\u2014Held on the first of S\u00e1wan. People draw a line with cowdung round the walls of their houses, about three feet above the ground. The meaning of this is unknown, but is probably a superstition connected with the averting of sickness and calamity during the rainy season.\n\n10. **Minjr\u00e1n k\u00e1 Mela**.\u2014This *mela* is held on the third Sunday in S\u00e1wan. In its main features it is peculiar to Chamba, though the name is known, and some of the ceremonies are observed in other parts of the hills. The essential part of the *mela* consists in the throwing into the R\u00e1vi of a male buffalo as a sacrifice to the river god. A week before the time comes round each person has a silk tassel made, which is attached to some part of the dress and worn. This is called a *minjar*. On the day appointed, the R\u00e1ja and his Court proceed to the spot, where the *mela* has been held from time immemorial. There a great concourse of people assembles. The R\u00e1ja gives the signal by throwing into the river a cocoanut, a rupee, drub grass, and some flowers, and thereupon the live buffalo is pushed into the flood. The R\u00e1ja throws his *minjar* in after the buffalo and all the people follow his example. The animal is then closely watched, as its fate is believed to foreshadow prosperity or adversity for the coming year to the reigning family and the State. If carried away and drowned, the event is regarded as propitious, the sacrifice having been accepted. If it crosses the river and gets out on the other bank, this also is propitious\u2014the sins of the town having been transferred to the other side of the river. But if it emerges on the same side, coming evil is portended to the State. Being a devoted thing, the animal, if it escapes, is retained till the following year, doing no work, and is then cast in again, and so on till finally carried away and drowned. The buffalo is provided at the expense of the State. This *mela* is probably of aboriginal origin, and connected with the earth-worship, which was so prevalent among the aborigines of the hills. It was probably intended to\nsecure good rains and a bountiful harvest. The ancient name of the river god in Aryan times was Varuna and the present name is Birbatal, but he also bears a Muhammadan name, Khw\u00e1ja Khizr, and is worshipped all over the Punjab, as the god of wells, springs, streams, and rivers. The fact of the mela being always held on Sunday may have some connection with sun-worship.\n\n11. Bhojri.\u2014This fair is held for the two days following the minjar mela, and is attended only by women and girls. These in gay apparel, climb the flight of steps to the Ch\u00e1munda Temple, singing as they go, and offer flowers. It is probably a continuation of the minjar but the meaning is now unknown.\n\n12. Bh\u00e1don k\u00ed Sankr\u00e1nt.\u2014Called Patroru k\u00ed Sankr\u00e1nt. P\u00e1trorus are made of the leaves of the Kach\u00e1l\u00fa plant, on which are spread flour, salt, condiments, &c., and the whole is cooked in gh\u00ed or oil and eaten, and some given to Brahmans.\n\n13. Rakhar Punya.\u2014Held at the time of the new moon in Bh\u00e1don. A silk thread called Rakhr\u00ed, made by a Brahman, is tied round the right wrist, and worn till the Rath Rathani mela comes round, when it is taken off and thrown at the Rath.\n\n14. Durb\u00e1shtmi.\u2014Held on the eighth day of the light half of As\u00faj or Bh\u00e1don. This is the day for bathing in the Man\u00ed Mahes lake, in the Budhil valley. Pilgrims come from long distances, and from beyond the confines of the State, and in passing through Chamba in bands, call aloud, \u201cMan\u00ed Mahes k\u00ed jai.\u201d On the day of the mela at the Man\u00ed Mahes lake a man starts with water from the lake, which he carries to Chatr\u00e1r\u00ed. With it Satk\u00ed Devi, the goddess of the place, is bathed, and the mela there is held on the third day after that at Man\u00ed Mahes.\n\n15. Janam ashtmi.\u2014This is a fast in honour of the birth of Krishna held on the eighth day of the dark half of Bh\u00e1don. Women visit the Lakshmi N\u00e1r\u00e1yan Temple, and special puja is done. Only phulan and grains suitable to fasts are eaten. Bh\u00e1don is called the k\u00e1l\u00f3 mah\u00edn\u00e1, owing to Krishna\u2019s birthday falling in it, he being always depicted as black.\n\n16. Anant Chaudas.\u2014A fast held on the fourteenth day of the dark half of the moon in Bh\u00e1don, and one day before the Rath Rathn\u00ed mela. An \u00e1nant or armlet is put on the arm, which may be either of thread or silver. If of silver, it is left on for good; if of thread, it is renewed at the end of a year with certain ceremonies. Every night in Bh\u00e1don, a number of d\u00edv\u00e1s or earthen lamps, are lit for a short time in the name of the pitrs (ancestors), and after burning a little while are allowed to go out. The number varies from five to seven.\n\n17. Sair k\u00ed sankr\u00e1nt.\u2014The first day of As\u00faj. This ceremony is held to mark the ingathering of the autumn harvest. New grain is worshipped with the kimb or lemon. Sanj or sweet bread\nfried in ghi is made, and worshipped along with the new grains of the season. On this day Shiva is believed to forsake his abode on the Kailas peak, near Brahmsur, and retire for the winter to the lower regions of the Earth called Payilpur, where he remains till Shiv\u00e1tr\u00ed comes round in the month of Ph\u00e1gun. On the same day the Gaddi shepherds in P\u00e1ngi and L\u00e1hul begin their return journey towards the outer hills.\n\n18. Rath Rathni.\u2014This mela is held at the new moon of As\u00faj. The Rath is a square frame of wood with a piece of cloth tied round it, and is prepared at the Hari Rai Temple. The Rathni is the figure of a woman made up with clothes, and is prepared in the precincts of the Lakshmi N\u00e1riyan Temple. All being ready, the people throw their rakhars or silk armlets, worn since the Rakhar Punya mela, at the Rath, and it is then carried to the Chaug\u00e1n, and is met by the Rathni, which has been brought from the Lakshmi N\u00e1riyan Temple. The two figures are made to touch each other, and the bearers then rush apart. The Rathni is taken to the Champ\u00e1vati Temple, and the Rath is carried through the town, brought back to the Chaug\u00e1n, and torn in pieces. The mela seems to be associated with marriage and widowhood, but the true significance has been lost. It is probably of ancient origin.\n\n19. Purnhout or R\u00e1m Nawmi.\u2014These are the first nine days in the light half of As\u00faj, and Purnhout is the last of them. They are considered to be very lucky. As far as possible, all new undertakings are begun in these days. Parents send their children to school for the first time. On Purnhout young unmarried girls are given sweetmeats and worshipped.\n\n20. The Nier\u00e1tr\u00e1s.\u2014This is much the same as the preceding. These \"nine nights\" occur twice a year, in As\u00faj and Ch\u00e9t, and the ninth or last is called Purnhout in As\u00faj, and R\u00e1m Nawmi in Ch\u00e9t. On each occasion they are the first nine nights of the light half of the moon.\n\n21. Durga ashtami.\u2014This mela is held in honour of Durga or K\u00e1l\u00ed, and is on the eighth day of the light half of As\u00faj. There is a special service in Shiva and K\u00e1l\u00ed temples, with ceremonies in the houses of the people.\n\n22. Vijai Dashmi.\u2014Held on the tenth day of the light half of As\u00faj. It is the same as the Das\u00e9hra on the plains, but is not much observed. Puja is done to the hearth, and fires are lit for the first time, for the winter.\n\nThe same date is observed as the birthday of horses, and a horse from the R\u00e1ja's stable, gaudily caparisoned, is led round from house to house, the grooms expecting a present. This birthday is observed at night in the Palace on the approach of winter.\n\n23. Karva Chauth.\u2014Held on the fourth day of the light half of As\u00faj, and is a day of fasting for women, who are not in widowhood.\nMothers send something specially prepared, and called *baya*, to their daughters, or if the mother is dead the woman cooks it herself. At night the women of a family sit in a circle, sing, and pass the *baya* round among themselves and their friends. They worship the moon on its appearing, and break their fast by partaking of food, giving it first to the oldest person present.\n\n24. *Hoi.*\u2014This *mela* is held in As\u00faj. Mothers of sons fast, and at night, after giving dinner to the *jhinwari* or water-carrier, they take new grain, and place it on a board with figures on it. This is then given to the *jhinwari*.\n\n25. *Panj Bhikh\u00e1mi Ek\u00e1d\u00e1sh.*\u2014This is the first of five days of fasting, and falls on the 11th day of the light half of K\u00e1tak. Only fruit or grain is eaten, no cooked food.\n\n26. *Diw\u00e1l\u00ed.*\u2014Held two days before the new moon in K\u00e1tak. They make a drawing of the feet of Lakshm\u00ed, wife of Vishnu, the goddess of wealth, and worship her. At night they distribute sweets, and light up their houses and shops for the goddess to come in, with the wealth she is supposed to bestow on favoured votaries. The law against gambling being relaxed, by order of the R\u00e1ja, for two or three days, the people give themselves up to this practice, both in public and private.\n\n27. *Bhali R\u00e1j.*\u2014Held one day before the new moon in K\u00e1tak, being the day following the Diw\u00e1l\u00ed. On this day all Hindu workmen and artificers worship the tools used in their several trades or occupations. The day is observed as a holiday, no work of any kind being done in which their tools would be employed; incense is burnt to his tools by each workman, and sweetmeats are distributed.\n\n28. *Bh\u00e1i Duj.*\u2014Held on the day of the new moon, following the previous festival. Sisters visit their brothers with sweets and *tambol* (a napkin containing sugar, cardamoms, and dried cocoanut) and present these presents. Brothers in their turn give a dinner to their sisters.\n\n29. *Lohri.*\u2014This *mela* is held on the last two days of Poh, the first day being called *J\u00e1gra*, and the second *Lohri*. A fire is lit by the boys and young men in each of the 12 *mahallas*, or quarters, into which the town is divided, and each of these is named *Lohri*. The one near the palace is called *R\u00e1ja ki Lohri*. On the first night the young men engaged in the *Lohri* proceedings are, by common consent, and ancient custom, allowed to carry away and burn any wood they can lay their hands on. A careful watch has to be kept on all heaps of timber, gates, &c., even gate posts, if of wood, being pulled up and burnt. No respect is shown to State property any more than to that of private persons.(1) The doors used to be wrenched off houses, and shop-keepers sleeping in front of their shops were liable to have themselves deposited on the ground, and\n\n(1) The rough play in connection with this *mela* has greatly diminished in recent years.\nthe charpai seized and burnt. On the second night, or night of the Lohri, after certain rites, a mash\u00e1ra or torch of wood is lit at the R\u00e1j\u00e1\u2019s fire, carried round to the others in order, and thrust into each of them. From each a fresh torch is lit and joins the procession, the R\u00e1j\u00e1\u2019s torch leading. At each Lohri or fire a struggle takes place, the young men of the mahalla trying to wrench the torches from the hands of the intruders, and burn them. Only the R\u00e1j\u00e1\u2019s torch is unmolested. In trying to do this, fierce fights used to take place, sometimes with injury to life and limb. The proceedings are now controlled by the police. Having made the circuit of the town the torch bearers come down to the Chaug\u00e1n where there are three fires. After thrusting their mash\u00e1ras into them, the remnants of the torches are carried back to the different mahallas, unless they have been entirely lost in the struggle. At this mela brothers give khichri (d\u00e1l and rice) to their sisters and other relatives and also to the Brahmans.\n\n30. M\u00e1gh k\u00e1 Sankr\u00e1n\u0303t.\u2014This is the first day of M\u00e1gh, which is observed as a holiday. They feast their relatives and friends, give to Brahmans, and make special offerings in the temples. Khichri is eaten.\n\n31. Bhim Sen Ek\u00e1dash.\u2014A fast in honour of Bhim Sen, a hero of antiquity, and held on the 11th day of the light half of M\u00e1gh.\n\n32. Sanghat Chauth.\u2014Held on the fourth day of the light half of M\u00e1gh. Women fast during the day, and prepare balls of til with sugar, and break their fast after the moon rises.\n\n33. Basant Panjm\u00ed.\u2014Held on the fifth day of the light half of M\u00e1gh, this being regarded as the first day of Spring. People offer flowers in the temples and also sweets, which are afterwards distributed. It is customary to wear something yellow on this day, such as a yellow pagri, this being the prevailing colour of the season in nature.\n\n34. Sh\u00edvr\u00e1tri.\u2014This mela is held on the third day before the new moon of Ph\u00e1gun, being the night in which Shiva is believed to return from Pay\u00e1lpur, or the lower regions, where he spends the winter, to the Kail\u00e1s at Brahmaur. Earth worms, snakes, etc., which have been deep in the ground all winter, are believed to come up to the surface along with Shiva, and this would seem to indicate that Shivaism is essentially an earth worship, probably of aboriginal origin. The day is observed as a fast with special offerings in the Shiva temples. On this day the Gaddi shepherds begin their return journey towards the higher mountains, from their winter pastures near the plains.\n\nDholru k\u00ed Sankr\u00e1n\u0303t. This is the first day of Chet being New Year\u2019s Day of the S\u00e1lav\u00e1hana era. The people think it lucky to hear the name of the month first from the mouths of Dumnas\nor low caste musicians, who in accordance with ancient custom, go round for eight days from door to door, each with a dhol or drum, singing and playing. Presents of clothes, grain and money are given them.\n\n35. Hol\u012b.\u2014The festival is held on the day of the full moon of Ph\u00e1gun or Chet. As already mentioned, the rough play with throwing of coloured flour, so general at this season on the plains, does not take place in Chamb\u0101; it having been transferred for some reason to the Hor\u012b festival in the beginning of Bais\u0101kh. Firewood is collected from the different parts of the town during the day, and piled up near the palace, where two large bonfires are prepared. As evening sets in, these are lit, and many others may be seen blazing on the adjacent hills. Some religious ceremonies are performed by a Brahman before the fire is lit, and the people afterwards throw in grains of Indian corn and other cereals, and walk round the flame. Puja is again done to the hearth and fires are discontinued for the season from the time of this mela. The people also observe the festival privately in the same manner in their own homes. It is doubtless connected with the advent of the New Year, which formerly began in Chait.\n\n36. Suhiy\u00e1n.\u2014This mela begins on the 15th Chet, and lasts till 1st Bais\u0101kh, inclusive. The circumstances from which it took its origin have already been related (page 78). It is believed to date from the time of R\u00e1ja S\u00e1hila Varma, A.D. 920-40. The first five days are for low caste women, the second five for girls of high caste, and the third five for high caste women. The three last days are the chief days of the mela, and the last day is called Sukhr\u00e1t, meaning \"peace be with you.\" On these three days especially, the women of the town and neighbourhood may be seen in their gayest attire, climbing the steps to the R\u00e1m\u2019s shrine, where they sing her praises and present their floral offerings. Only women and girls are present, and on this great occasion even the Palace Ladies are allowed to mingle with the throng and join in the celebration. They are all entertained at the R\u00e1ja\u2019s expense.\n\nMost of the above festivals are observed, more or less fully in the villages of the Sadr wiz\u00e1rat as well as in the capital, and many of them in the other wiz\u00e1rats.\nCHAPTER II.\u2014ECONOMIC.\n\nSection A.\u2014Agriculture.\n\nThe general appearance of the country has already been described, and the agricultural system is just what one would expect in such surroundings. The terraced fields, with which the traveller in Switzerland is familiar, are here the commonest of sights. They are laid out with a regularity and eager care to secure every cultivable inch, that shews a wonderful diligence and pertinacity on the part of the peasants. When the valleys open out into level places, as at Chamba itself, we find large fields parcelled out as in the plains. These level spots are frequently of many acres in extent, and present a picturesque appearance of comfort and simplicity, as they nestle at the foot of some beetling promontory. Another feature of the landscape are the plateaux along both banks of the principal rivers, and in many of the side valleys and ravines; often projecting to a considerable height above the surrounding country, with almost perfectly level tops, like sugar loaves with the conical end sliced off. These flat tops lend themselves to cultivation, but the crops necessarily depend solely on the rainfall for their existence. This is not so constant as might be expected, or rather the rain, though frequent enough, does not always fall in sufficient quantities at the proper time of the year. What renders many fields unproductive, when all other circumstances are favourable, is the presence of stones which crop up in perfectly astonishing numbers. The more they are cleared away the more stones there seem to be. Here and there one may see evidences of the unavailing labour of the farmer in this respect, in the lines of stone walls, which make the fields present a very good imitation of some of the best hunting-country in the west of Ireland.\n\nThe people divide the soil into the two main classes of kuhli, i.e., that irrigated by kuhls, and otar, i.e., that dependent solely on the rainfall. Each of the two classes is divided into three kinds, according to the situation and nature of the land, viz., maidan, oti, and gaggal. Maidan means land more or less level and open, oti means land that is rugged and uneven, and gaggal land that is full of stones. Thus we have the six sorts of soil:\n\nMaidan Kuhli, Oti Kuhli, Gaggal Khuli; Maidan Otar, Oti Otar, Gaggal Otar.\n\nSome further divisions of the kinds of soil will be noticed under the heading \u201csystem of agriculture\u201d; they are peculiar to one or two wiz\u0101rats, and are not recognised throughout the State.\n\nThe spring or rabi harvest is here known as b\u0101hri, and the autumn harvest or khur\u012bf as saur\u012b. There are variations of these words in the different wiz\u0101rats, for instance in l\u0101ngi the harvests are called b\u0101sti and shirw\u0101n, respectively. The b\u0101hri crop is sown\n\n(1) These are composed of alluvial conglomerates, and are probably of lacustrine origin.\nin Asuj (September-October) and reaped in S\u00e1wan (July-August), the sa\u00fari is sown in S\u00e1wan and reaped in Asuj. It will be seen that the spring crop is particularly late in these regions as compared with the plains, and this makes the hill peasants' summer a very busy time. However, it is not in many places that two crops are obtained.\n\nRotation of crops is fairly well understood and its importance realised by the hill farmers, but the order varies with the different conditions natural to a mountainous country. In the Bhattiy\u00e1t and the lower parts of the R\u00e1vi Valley wheat alternates with rice in kuhli or irrigated land, and wheat or barley with makki, m\u00e1sh, etc., in otar or unirrigated land. In the higher mountains little rice is grown, and the winter crops, consisting of wheat, barley and masur ka ddt, are usually followed by makki, phullan or bres, etc. The general order of rotation is somewhat as follows:\n\nWheat, phullan, m\u00e1sh or bres, after which the land meant for the makki crop is often left fallow for the winter, and wheat is sown on this land after the makki is cut; and is followed by phullan, bres or m\u00e1sh the next summer. The rotation is not carried out on any fixed system and seems to depend very much on the individual practice of the farmers.\n\nIn P\u00e1ngi much the same order is observed, but there hardly any maize is grown, and after cutting the wheat and barley crops the unirrigated land lies fallow all winter and is used for ela in the following spring. Phullan and bres are sown in irrigated land after the wheat and barley crops are cut. In L\u00e1hul and the Bhota\u00fari villages of P\u00e1ngi the land is all el\u00edfa\u0161i, the crops being sown in spring and reaped in autumn, but there too a certain rotation of crops is customary.\n\nThe fields are manured as far as possible for every crop, but special manuring is provided for the wheat, maize and tobacco crops. The materials used as manure are: (1) goha or mail, that is cattle dung, fresh or dry, which is collected in a heap, called malch, near the village; (2) the leaves and grass used for bedding the cattle, which after being soaked with the excreta of the animals is, like the cattle dung and any other refuse material or sweepings, daily added to the heap. This goes on fermenting all winter till in Bais\u00e1kh or Jeth the first demand for manure is made upon it, and this is repeated for every crop sown. After the first ploughing, called ogh\u00e1r, the manure is scattered over the field and a second ploughing, called j\u00e1l, then takes place to mix it with the soil. The seed is then sown and for the third time, called berak, the plough is passed over the ground, being followed by the suk\u00e1ga or dah to level off the surface and complete operations. Owing to the great labour involved ploughing is seldom done more than thrice in the hills, but great importance is attached to proper manuring. For some crops the ploughing is only done twice, or even once.\nFor the rice and wheat crops especially manure is often obtained by folding sheep and goats in the fields; and for this purpose passing Gaddis are induced by liberal payment to allow their flocks to settle for several nights in different fields. Indeed there is often a brisk competition for this favour among the farmers, which the Gaddis do not fail to turn to their own advantage. This kind of manure is considered the most valuable of all.\n\nThe principal staples in the Sadr wiz\u00e1rat are wheat, barley, rape seed, masur (lentils), dh\u00e1n, (rice) makki, kodr\u00e1,(1) tobacco, til,(2) m\u00e1sh,(3) mung,(4) kulth,(5) phullan,(6) suil,(7) and bres.(8) Chur\u00e1h produces the same crops, with the addition of a little opium. This wiz\u00e1rat and the Bhatity\u00e1at are the most fertile in the State, the latter being especially rich in moist land like that known as \u00e1bi in the plains. It produces most of the crops mentioned above, but the principal crop is dh\u00e1n or rice, in the cultivation of which a large proportion of the population is engaged. Brahmaur also produces these crops, but in a lesser degree, with kauni(9) and chinai(10) in addition.\n\nWheat, barley, bres, phullan, and potatoes are common to both P\u00e1ngi and L\u00e1hul, whilst P\u00e1ngi also produces elo, suil, baj\u00e1r bhang, chinai, kodr\u00e1, mas\u00far and peas. All hilly tracts and sunny villages produce potatoes. The following kinds of vegetables are also grown in P\u00e1ngi:\u2014(1) Pabain, a kind of chukri (rhubarb) which is stored in September, and threshed and ground with wheat or barley, (2) Tila or sweet p\u00e1tis, which is eaten when fresh and green, with salt, or sometimes it is boiled first. The flour made from it is mixed with wheat, and then baked into loaves. (3) When grain is scarce, a kind of grass, called kangash, is threshed, steeped (to remove the bitter taste), and eaten with butter, milk, or curds. The fruit of the Pav\u00eda Indica (gun) is also collected for food for man in times of scarcity; after being soaked in water for several days to remove the bitter flavour, it is ground and eaten, either alone or mixed with flour, as when taken alone it is very bitter.\n\nChur\u00e1h supplies Bakloh and Dalhousie with grain, and P\u00e1ngi also has often to make demands on the same wiz\u00e1rat for all sorts of food-grains. The surplus produce of Sihunta, Bhattitikri and Tundi is sometimes sent to N\u00farpur and K\u00e1ngra, but very often a return is required in times of scarcity. In Brahmaur, Trehta and Chanota\u00ed it is impossible to get rid of surplus produce, and in the days of scarcity no help can be given; so cut off are these places from the neighbouring wiz\u00e1rats. Hence arises the proverb:\u2014\n\nMata ho\u00ed\u00e1, t\u00e1n p\u00e1na kot\u00e1\u00edn.\nN\u00e1hin ho\u00ed\u00e1, t\u00e1n j\u00e1n\u00e1 kot\u00e1\u00edn.\n\n(1) Eleusine coroconos.\n(2) Sesamum Indicum.\n(3) Phaseolus radiatus.\n(4) Phaseolus mungo.\n(5) Delichos uniflorus.\n(6) Fagopyrum emarginatum.\n(7) Amaranthus anardana.\n(8) Fagopyrum esculentum.\n(9) Pennisetum Italicum.\n(10) Panicum miliaceum.\nIf the harvest is plenty,\nThere's no one to buy;\nIf the harvest is scanty,\nWe must lie down and die.\n\nArable land comprises kohli and otar; the former irrigated by kuhls or outs, and the latter dependent on rain. In Chamba proper many small fields, watered by streamlets, produce dh\u00e1n or rice, and it is also produced in the lower parts of Chur\u00e1h, but not in P\u00e1ngi or Brahmaur. It is grown in abundance in the plain tracts of the Bhattiy\u00e1t, and this makes it the richest tract in the State. Land which produces dh\u00e1n with the aid of rain is called amr\u00e1ni kohli, and is regarded as equal to otar. Though the R\u00e1vi flows through the State, it irrigates no portion of it, but water for irrigation is mainly drawn from small streams, by means of kuhls or outs. Land near the capital, irrigated by streams, is termed kuhli; similar land in Chur\u00e1h is called kohli or sh\u00e1li, and in Bhattiy\u00e1t kuhli, ruhni or dh\u00e1n\u00ed. Crops and grass cannot be grown in fields in P\u00e1ngi or L\u00e1hul without irrigation.\n\nRice is grown in three ways termed ruhni, battar and chhaip.\n\nRuhni.\u2014Early in Jeth, dh\u00e1n is kept moist for eight or tendays, till it has germinated. Then it is sown in nurseries in which the water is retained, called orih\u00e1n. First the field is twice ploughed, and ridges (bir) are then made in it. When the field is full of water, the owner summons the people of the neighbouring villages to his aid. Next morning, men and women with their bullocks all come to the fields, and all get in the morning one or two chap\u00e1ttis as their nuh\u00e1ri or breakfast. The men plough the fields and repair the ridges. Some take up the plants from the nursery, and pass them in small bundles (juri or roli) to the women to plant in the fields. These women are called ruhi. At noon, they are given wheaten bread, d\u00e1l, k\u00e1ri, ghi, and ladhu, at the owner's cost. The women amuse themselves by throwing mud on the passers-by, and sing merrily all the while. Those who work reciprocally for one another are only fed, but the menials, who are not helped in return, are paid thus:\u2014a woman gets six rotis (loaves) and one m\u00e1ni (1\u00bd sers) of wheat flour, and a man two sers of wheat; but these rates vary in different localities.\n\nBattar.\u2014In Bais\u00e1kh the fields are twice ploughed to crush the clods, and then watered in Jeth. After the water has dried up, the field is levelled with a clod-crusher, and the rice sown.\n\nChhaip.\u2014The field is prepared as in the ruhni method, and germinated rice grains are sown in it, without being sown in a nursery. The ruhni and then either the battar or chhaip methods are used alternately every second year, the object being to level the fields, which have been made uneven by the battar and chhaip.\nprocesses, by the ruhni. The ruhni is a more expensive method than either of the other two, as it involves more labour. The chhaip yields an abundant crop, but it is very liable to result in loss if the rains fail, and so it is not popular.\n\nThe chhaip and battar methods of sowing rice are common in the Bhattiy\u00e1t, and in lands near the capital, where the fields are large. But the ruhni is in vogue where the irrigated fields are small, and the fields are allowed to lie fallow in the Rabi. Kuhls are also called challas, and the opening from a challa into a field is called oniy\u00e1ri or muni\u00e1ri.\n\nIn the Bhattiy\u00e1t, in large irrigated villages, the State kuhls are managed by paid officials. Elsewhere the zamind\u00e1rs, by themselves or through the k\u00e1md\u00e1rs, appoint a man as their kohli, and it is his duty to collect labour and repair the kuhls either late in Bais\u00e1kh, or early in Jeth. He distributes water to the zamind\u00e1rs in turn, and settles all disputes connected with it himself, or submits them to the k\u00e1md\u00e1rs of the pargana. The kohli is unpaid but gets his food on the ruhn day; besides a l\u00e1ngh (man's load) of grain at harvest, according to the extent of the land irrigated. In some places the kohli gets a m\u00e1ni of dh\u00e1n for each kunnu or ghumao. If the kohli is of impure caste, he receives both food and l\u00e1ngh, on the ruhn day. He receives this as a gift and not as of right.\n\nMakki, maize or Indian corn, is the staple product and food of the people, who sow it largely throughout the State, except in P\u00e1ngi, L\u00e1hal, the higher and colder villages of Brahmanr, and the level irrigated parts of the Bhattiy\u00e1t, which only grow dh\u00e1n. Makki is universally called kukari, and is consumed all the year round. Its merits have passed into a proverb in Chamba:\n\nKukari sig\u00e1n, : R\u00e1thi puchhiy\u00e1n.\nWith kukari to feed him,\nThe Hillman is strong;\nWith a R\u00e1thi to lead him,\nHe'll never go wrong.\n\nThis grain is produced more abundantly than any other crop of either the Khar\u00edf or Rabi. If the makki crop fails, it means famine in Chur\u00e1h and the b\u00e1rv\u00e1ni villages of the Bhattiy\u00e1t. In the colder parts a piece of land is kept fallow in the Khar\u00edf. Such a plot is called bas\u00e1nd or baind in Ch\u00e1krohi(1) and Chur\u00e1h, phalli in Brahmanr, and braydh in the Bhattiy\u00e1t.\n\nThe bas\u00e1nd is either manured, or sheep and goats are penned on it, and after a shower of rain makki is sown in it in Bais\u00e1kh, or early in Jeth. In warm villages it is sown after the Rabi has been out. The crop first sown is called jethi and the last sown kanhi, from jetha elder and kanha younger.\n\n(1) Ch\u00e1krohi means four kos all round Chamba town. It is not an il\u00f3go, but includes portions of several il\u00f3gos.\nThe method of cultivation is as follows:\u2014The land is first manured, then ploughed, (the first ploughing is called ogh\u0101r), and finally sown. When the makki appears above the ground within a week or so, the field is weeded. When the crop grows high, it requires a second ploughing. One man drives the bullocks, and two or three men follow him to lift up the plants, etc. If the crop is too thick, the plants are thinned out. This is called halodni or gudni. Jackals, pigs, and bears damage the crops, which require constant watching at night, especially if near or in a forest, and both men and women light fires in the fields, and keep watch on pah\u1e5b\u0101tis (mach\u0101ns). The produce is generally excellent, but the labour required is considerable. After the maize crop has been cut the cobs are separated from the stalks and spread out on the saran, or flat roofs of the village houses, to dry; affording a very pretty sight in autumn. The grain is then separated from the cobs and stored away.\n\nIn some parts of P\u0101ngi two crops are always sown. Though it is a mountainous tract, some parts of it are warm and adapted to the cultivation of kukari. The produce is excellent, but the crop is not a favourite one, as it is coveted by the people, who either steal the cobs or beg for them. In fact the whole crop is thus consumed, or eaten, and the owner reaps no benefit from it.\n\nTobacco is grown only for private use, and four varieties are recognized:\u2014(1) tam\u0101k\u012b, the common or desi plant. (2) Tam\u0101k\u012b, a variety of the first. These two are most in favour. The plants, if not kept down, grow to a good height. (3) Gobi, which is not so tall, but the leaves spread out like those of a cabbage. (4) Bimbaru or Sappu grown in the higher mountains and P\u0101ngi. The first two kinds are sown in beds and transplanted; the other two are sown in the open field, but for all the soil must be well prepared and manured. Of the first two varieties only the leaves are used; but, in the case of the last two, leaves, stems and seeds are all pounded together for use, and they are said to be strong-flavoured and somewhat nauseous. All the varieties are planted at the beginning of the rains and cut in October.\n\nThere are two varieties of potatoes grown in the State; one of which is called Desi and the other Angrezi. The first are small and yellowish and the second large and whitish. Both kinds are planted in the spring\u2014March or April\u2014and the Angrezi kind ripen in June, the Desi not till September\u2014Potatoes were introduced into P\u0101ngi as late as 1878, and are now grown all through the valley; indeed one finds them more or less in every part of the State. A good market for them exists in Dalhousie during the season, and they are frequently exported to the plains in the cold weather.\n\nWheat is grown all over the State to the utmost limits of P\u0101ngi and L\u0101shul, and two varieties are recognized. The first, called b\u0101thru, is grown in Bhattiy\u0101t and the lower part of the R\u0101vi.\nValley, where it ripens early and is usually reaped in Jeth: the second, called barey\u0101ru, is found especially in the higher mountains and P\u0101ngi. It takes longer than the first variety to ripen and is not cut till H\u0101r or S\u0101wan. The b\u0101thru variety has a tall stalk and the grain is whitish in colour, while the other variety is short with a reddish grain.\n\nThe hill wheat is inferior in quality to that grown on the plains, and is sparingly used among the villagers; who prefer makki which is cheaper and more plentiful. Most of the wheat grown in the R\u0101vi Valley is sold in Chamba. This, however, does not apply to Bhattiy\u0101t where the people live chiefly on wheat and rice.\n\nBarley too is extensively grown and used by the villagers as food, either alone or mixed with wheaten flour. In P\u0101ngi the only variety is called elo, a kind of rye from which the spirituous liquor, named lugri is made. Sattu is made from parched barley and other grains. In Bhattiy\u0101t wheat and barley are sometimes sown in the same field, called berar.\n\nThe B\u0101hri or spring crops consist of the following:\u2014Wheat, barley, sarson, mas\u016br ka dal.\n\nThe Saiv\u012b or autumn crops are:\u2014Rice, makki, kodri, mash, mung, kuth, raung, chinai, kauni, bajari-bhang, salan, sul, phullan, bres, bangari, mol, tobacco, potatoes, til, a little kap\u016bs, peas, kesar.\n\nAs might be expected in a country which has not yet been opened up to foreign trade to any great extent, the cultivation of garden fruit is not extensively carried on. P\u0101ngi has an excellent climate, and is eminently adapted for the production of many kinds of fruit, but the people are chary of growing it, owing to the absence of markets and assured profits. The orchard planted by the Forest Department yields all kinds of fruits.\n\nThe wild and cultivated apricot (desi chir and kh\u016bmd\u0101ni), the walnut, peach, apple, pear, plum and quince are grown in the Sadr wizarat. Chur\u0101h produces apples, pears, walnuts, and quince. The wild apricot is also gathered and dried: it is then called kishta or sukera. In P\u0101ngi, the edible pine, (chilgoza), th\u0101ngi (hazelnut), and a walnut with a very hard shell grow wild in the forests and fields. The wild gooseberry and the black and red currant are common, also wild rhubarb. The bramble, raspberry and strawberry are found in various parts of the State. L\u0101bul gives no fruit but the wild apricot. In Brahmaur the walnut, peach, wild apricot, and other similar fruits are very common. The warmer parts of the Bhattiy\u0101t are the only places in which the mango is cultivated. Oil is expressed from the stones of the various fruits, and used for lamps.\n\nThe only place in which tea is cultivated in the State is in those parts that are nearest to Sh\u0101hpur and Kangra, in British territory. The climate is very favourable for its cultivation. The soil also is all that would be desired.\nHops were tried at one time, but abandoned, as the outturn decreased in quantity and quality. Pangi was found to be very suitable for hops. Sericulture was also tried with good results, but was abandoned on the closure of the filature at Sujanpur.\n\nThe cattle are generally small in size. Buffaloes are a rather recent importation: they are mostly kept by Gujars, but some of the village people also keep them for their domestic purposes. Sheep are almost universally kept, and blankets and wearing apparel are manufactured from the wool. The ponies of Lahul are well known; they are small and rough-coated, reminding one strongly of the shelties of the North of Scotland, but they are not quite so shaggy. As might be expected, they are excellent ponies for the rugged and dangerous mountain paths. They are very largely used in the State. Goats are even more numerous than sheep. It is a very pretty sight to see a Gaddi bringing his flock home at night, down some steep mountain ravine. The shepherd leads the way with a heavy bundle of faggots on his back, and an axe in his hand, which he uses as a support, or balancing pole. He comes down the most awkward-looking paths imaginable, paths which, to the ordinary eye, seem to be no paths at all, with a quiet, easy gait, turning round at intervals to utter the quaint musical call to his rambling followers, the yodel of the Himalayas. Meanwhile the sheep and goats are proceeding in a long zigzag line, bounding up and down the hillside feeding as busily as if they thought they would never eat again, but holding on their way steadily, all except some young giddy member of the flock, who wishes to try for a path for himself. On this one the shepherd constantly keeps his eye, sending special calls and imprecatious in his direction, and sometimes having to go back and administer reproof with no gentle hand. Occasionally a brawling torrent has to be crossed, and then the largest and boldest of the flock, the mountain hero, is seized and thrown headlong into the stream. After the first shock, he buffets his way manfully across, and then stands on the further side, as if to encourage the others by his presence, and to urge them to emulate his example. Generally the rest follow with a little persuasion, but the last timid half dozen or so have to be hauled across by sheer force, and sometimes a sickly one is carried over in the shepherd\u2019s arms.\n\nThe cows are not of a good breed; they give little milk, and that of an inferior quality.\\(^{(1)}\\) Mention should be made of the Gaddi dogs, which are of a singularly handsome appearance, large, strong, and with beautiful glossy black coats. They are much more companionable than the pie dogs of the plains. Cats are common in Chamba.\n\n\\(^{(1)}\\) A number of Ayrshire cows were imported about forty years ago for the Raja\u2019s dairy, and though the breed has deteriorated since then it is still much superior to any other in Chamba.\nIn Pangi, Lahul, and in the village of Kugti in Brahmaur ploughing is done by churs (a kind of hill bullock used for ploughing), and not by desi bullocks. The churs are bred from jut-churs (yaks) which are brought from the high ranges of Pangi, Lahul, or Zanskar, as they cannot be bred in a warm country. One or two jut-churs, according to requirements, are kept for breeding in each village. The animal is either bought by the villagers jointly, or by a well-to-do man. In Pangi its price ranges from Rs. 20 to Rs. 25, and in Zanskar from Rs. 14 to Rs. 15. By cross-breeding from a desi hill cow and a jut-chur, the bull (chur) and cow (churi) are produced. The churs are generally castrated. The jut-chur and churi do not breed together.\n\nCross-breeding has been successfully attempted from desi bulls and churs. The bullocks are generally sold off in Churah; but the cows are fed for milk. Two churs are yoked in a plough, but in Mindhal village a single chur is used, under an order of the Devi of the place, as the tradition is that, if two are used, one will die. The plough chur is led by one man, who holds a rope fastened to a ring in its nose, another following to guide the plough.\n\nOn the 1st of Katik, when all the cattle are brought home, the jut-chur is left on the mountain pastures until snow falls, when it is brought home by five or six men. As soon as the weather gets warm, the animal is again taken up to the high mountains.\n\nBrahmaur landholders only keep a few animals, which they feed indoors. Almost all the people go to Kangra or Chamba, in winter, and in large villages they leave behind them one or two families, termed hiundasi (or those who remain in winter) to look after their houses and cattle. The hiundasi receives a pira of grain for each head of cattle with 5 seers of salt, Chamba weight; and when the owner returns early in summer, he takes charge of his cattle again. Churah landholders have generally acquired some lands on the high mountains, where they drive up their cattle in summer to graze in the rich pastures, called adhwara or dushdra.\n\nOwing to lack of fodder, the Bhattiyat people keep few animals, but those who live in the higher hills and have plenty of fodder, can keep as many as they choose. The Zamindars of Brahmaur, Trehta, Chanota, Koti-ranhu, and Piura leave their cattle in charge of hiundasis, and either come down to Kangra or Chamba, or seek a home in other parganas of the State for their families and cattle. In the winter they earn a living in these places by daily labour; the men threshing rice, and the women serving in other people's houses. There they live for six months, returning home in Baisakh or Jeth. On arriving home they find the rabi ready to cut, and then sow the kharif.\n\nPoultry are very common in Churah and also to a less extent in the Sadr wizarat; but are not reared in Brahmaur or Bhattiyat, owing to the caste prejudices of the people. They are found\nchiefly with Muhammadan and low caste farmers, and a brisk trade in fowls and eggs is kept up all the summer with Dalhousie, while the season lasts. A few fowls and eggs are also now procurable by travellers in P\u00e1ngi, where in recent years the villagers have begun to rear them, but they are always very dear. In Chamba fowls sell at six to ten annas each, and eggs at six to eight annas per dozen. In winter they are cheaper. The breed is the ordinary country fowl. In 1879\u201485 Colonel C. H. T. Marshall, while Superintendent of the State, did much to improve the breed, and was very successful in Chamba town, but it has now almost reverted to the original type.\n\nBeehives may be found in almost every village in the inner hills. The hive (gan\u00e1r) is a portion of the trunk of a tree\u2014some 4 feet long and $1\\frac{1}{2}$ feet in diameter\u2014hollowed out from end to end so as to leave only a thin shell. In building a house this is laid across the wall, one end being flush with the outside and the other projecting a little into the interior. Both ends are closed with a circular slab or a piece of wood\u2014the outer end having a small hole in it for the bees to come and go. When the comb is ready the inner end is opened and a smouldering wisp of straw held near it, and as the bees retire from the smoke the comb is extracted and the aperture closed up. The people never eat the comb with the honey, and the honey sells at 4 sers for the rupee and the wax at 3 sers. The same colony of bees may continue for a long time in the same place, and there are often several hives in the same wall, but it is rare for any of the villagers to be stung. There are usually two crops of honey, one in spring called bahria which is red in colour and the other in autumn called sairia, which is white.\n\nThe agricultural implements are of the simplest description. The plough is the ordinary light country plough (hal) used in the hills. The names of some of the implements vary in different parts of the State, and those given below are in use chiefly in the R\u00e1vi Valley.\n\n| No. | Name   | Description                  |\n|-----|--------|------------------------------|\n| 1   | Hal    | Plough.                      |\n| 2   | Bhela  | Adze.                        |\n| 3   | Nih\u00e1ni | Chisel.                      |\n| 4   | Dar\u00e1t  | Sickle.                      |\n| 5   | Dar\u00e1ti | Small sickle.                |\n| 6   | Jhontu | Axe.                         |\n| 7   | Knd\u00e1li | Hoe.                         |\n| 8   | Chini  | Wooden prong.                |\n| 9   | Kur\u00e1n  | Wooden spade.                |\n| 10  | Pharwa | Indian spade.                |\n| 11  | Chhaj  | Winnowing basket.            |\n| 12  | D\u00e1h    | Clod-crusher.                |\n| 13  | Karandi| Trowel.                     |\n| 14  | Kilta  | Large cone-shaped basket.    |\n| 15  | Tokri  | Basket.                      |\n| 16  | Karotari | Saw.                       |\nCHAP. II A.\n\nAll these implements are made by the village artisans, or by the farmers themselves, and the artisans are remunerated in kind at harvest time.\n\nWherever water power is available the gr\u0101\u1e6d or water-mill, which plays an important part in village life, is a conspicuous object beside the village stream. Though of the most primitive construction it yet exhibits much ingenuity in its details. A roughly built hut with a low doorway stands on the brink of the stream or on any other suitable spot near the bank. In this are placed in position the upper and nether millstones, the former being movable, and the latter fixed. The upper stone has a circular hole in the centre for the grain, and across it on the lower surface is an iron bar, fixed into the stone. To the middle of this is attached at right angles an iron spike, which passes downwards through a similar hole in the centre of the nether millstone, and is joined to an upright wooden cylinder with spokes at the lower end on which the water falls. The water-supply is brought from the nearest point and conveyed to the back of the mill where it falls with some force on the spokes. The cylinder is thus made to revolve, and with it the upper millstone. The hole in the nether millstone is closed with wood around the iron spike, so that no grain can escape. By a sluice above, the water-supply is turned on and off at pleasure. Above the upper stone is suspended an ordinary kilta or conical basket, full of grain, and from the bottom projects a small spout which, by a simple contrivance, is kept in constant motion, so that the grain falls automatically into the hole and is ground. The gr\u0101\u1e6di or miller is allowed a percentage at the rate of \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\)th part of the grain ground.\n\nSection B.\u2014Rents, Wages and Prices.\n\nProduce rents are the rule in the State though cash rents are becoming more and more common. The oldest and most general form of produce rent is called g\u0101h\u1e5b and consists in an equal division of the produce, of every kind, between landlord and tenant. This is a troublesome arrangement for the landlord, as he has to maintain a careful watch on the fields, especially at harvest time, to prevent leakage, and this has resulted in a modification of the g\u0101h\u1e5b system, called mudda, being adopted. Under it the landlord receives a fixed amount of produce according to agreement, whether the harvest is good or bad, which is sometimes commuted into a money payment.\n\nSometimes a landlord finds his land unremunerative in his own hands, and yet is unwilling to part with it. In such circumstances he may sublet it to a tenant on condition that the latter pays the whole revenue demand. This may be done either through the landlord or directly, but in the latter case the payment is made in the landlord\u2019s name. Under this system there is some risk of the tenant claiming possession after a certain number of years.\nThis is obviated by a clause in the agreement, providing for the resumption by the landlord of full rights in the land after a certain time. Sometimes a small sum of Re. 1 or Rs. 2 per l\u0101hri over and above the revenue demand is taken, called hagg m\u0101lik\u0101na; or this is imposed by the Court on an appeal being made to the law. If the occupant tenant has been in possession for a long time he can be ousted only if he fails to pay the revenue demand and the hagg m\u0101lik\u0101na for a year or two.\n\nWithin the Ch\u0101krohi, i.e., four miles around the capital, and near Dalhousie, the revenue demand on new land is double the ordinary rates.\n\nIn P\u0101ngi and L\u0101hul only one form of tenure is customary called adhig\u0101hri or g\u0101hri, that is an equal share of the crop between landlord and tenant; and no deduction is allowed to the tenant for seed.\n\nWages are given for quinquennial periods in table 25 of Part B. Wages have risen considerably in recent years. Formerly a day labourer received from two to two and-a-half annas; and in the mufassil parts of the State these rates are still prevalent where remuneration for labour is made in cash among the villagers. In the capital, however, owing to greater demand for labour and the proximity of Dalhousie and Dharamsala, the usual rate is now four annas for men and three annas for women. This increase in rates also applies to skilled labour. Formerly a carpenter or mason used to receive six or eight annas or even less, but a good workman cannot now be had under ten or twelve annas and the tendency is to rise still higher. In the capital all labour is paid for in cash, but in the villages all village servants are remunerated in kind, twice a year, at the spring and autumn harvests, also on special days called tijh\u0101r, and at marriages. This kind of remuneration remains much the same as formerly. Skilled artisans from the plains and also Pathan and Tibetan coolies usually receive considerably more than the regular rate of pay, as they do more work than the local hillmen.\n\nPrices of food stuffs are affected by local supply and demand, the proximity of Dalhousie, and the state of the market on the plains. The effect of these different factors is most felt in the capital. When prices are high on the plains in any one commodity, e.g., potatoes, export trade is brisk with a corresponding rise in local prices. Prices in the capital have lately been much enhanced by the influx into the State of several thousand sawyers and coolies in connection with the Timber Company working for the Forest Department. The Bhatriy\u0101t is the first part of the State to feel the effects of a rise of prices on the plains.\nThe following is a list of prices of the principal food staples in the State in 1909:\n\n| Article of food | Quantity per rupee |\n|-----------------|--------------------|\n| Rice            | 6 seers.           |\n| Maize           | 15 \"               |\n| Wheat           | 11 \"               |\n| Barley          | 18 \"               |\n| Phullan         | 12 \"               |\n| Brea            | 16 \"               |\n| Chanai          | 16 \"               |\n| Masar           | 8 \"                |\n| Thangi          | 2 \"                |\n| Zira            | 2 \"                |\n| Milk            | 16 \"               |\n| Ghi             | 1\u00bd \"               |\n| Makhan (in P\u00e1ngt, chopar) | 1\u00bd \" |\n\nOn the whole a decided advance in the material condition of the people is noticeable in recent years. This is most conspicuous in the capital, where a great change for the better has taken place. The houses now being erected are built on more sanitary principles, with greater attention to ventilation and light. The dangers resulting from damp in the floor and walls are more fully realised, and as far as possible obviated. The houses are also better furnished by those who can afford it. Much more money is now spent on dress, and the introduction of the sewing machine and cheap fabrics has brought about a marked change in the clothing of the people, with only a small increase in cost. This change is not so pronounced in the villages, but there too improvement is becoming visible, especially in the matter of dress. The fact of this improvement being concurrent with a steady advance in the cost of food stuffs points to a general rise in the standard of living and comfort. It is, however, much to be regretted that litigation is steadily on the increase, with, it is to be feared, its usual accompaniment, indebtedness.\n\nSection C.\u2014Forests.\n\nPrevious to 1864 the Chamba Forests were entirely under State control, but no records exist to show either the system on which they were managed or the revenue which was realised.\n\nIn 1864 the control of the reserved forests was, under the terms of a lease entered into with R\u00e1ja Sri Singh, vested in the British Forest Department; these forests forming one of the Punjab Forest Divisions. The lease was for 99 years, subject to a revision of rules every twenty years. Under the original rules Government paid a sum of Rs. 21,000 annually, of which a sum of Rs. 2,500 was returned to be expended on the planting and con-\n\n(1) By Mr. C. G. Trevor, Conservator of Forests, Chamba State.\nservation of forests. At the revision in 1884 it was arranged that no part of the annual payment of Rs. 21,000 should be returned and that the State should receive two-thirds of the net profits. At the revision in 1904 it was decided that the State should receive the whole income accruing to the British Government under the agreement, after deducting therefrom all sums advanced for the entire cost of working, supervision, protection and improvement as well as all other charges which are ordinarily held to form part of the expenditure connected with the management of the said forests. With effect from 1st April 1908 Government has now restored the management of the reserved forests to His Highness the Raja experimentally, for a period of five years, on the condition that the management is to be conducted on lines approved by Government.\n\nFor administrative purposes the Chamba Forests are divided into two classes:\n\n(a) Reserved Forests or those controlled by the State Forest Department and managed chiefly with a view to profit, and\n\n(b) Unclassed Forests or those controlled by the Civil Department of the State, which are generally of less value than the reserved forests and are chiefly useful for the supply of timber to zemindars for local consumption, and as summer grazing grounds.\n\nThe reserved forests are divided into five ranges, viz., Dalhousie, Chamba (including Brahmaur), Tisa, Bh\u00e1ndal and P\u00e1ngi, corresponding generally to the principal divisions of the State; and the exploitation of the produce in these areas is controlled by three working plans, one for Dalhousie forests, one for the Upper R\u00e1vi and one for P\u00e1ngi. These forests have all been surveyed on a scale of 4 inches to the mile and their areas are as follows:\u2014Dalhousie 4,635 acres, Upper R\u00e1vi 69,086 acres and P\u00e1ngi 26,925 acres. The yield of these forests is approximately as follows:\n\nDalhousie\u201415,000 cubic feet of sawn timber for the Dalhousie market and 50 first class chil trees, which are sold standing to local purchasers.\n\nUpper R\u00e1vi\u20142,400 first class deodar and 500 blue pine which are now sold standing at rates varying with the size of the trees.\n\nP\u00e1ngi\u20141,000 first class deodar and 350 blue pine which are now sold standing.\n\nThe produce of the Upper R\u00e1vi forests is extracted in the form of railway sleepers, and other sawn scantlings, and is floated down the R\u00e1vi to Shahpur, in the Gurd\u00e1sipur district, near Path\u00e1nkot on the North-Western Railway, and also to Lahore. The produce of the P\u00e1ngi forests is chiefly extracted in the form of logs\nand is floated down the Chen\u00e1b River to Akn\u00far where the logs are caught, tied into rafts, and rafted down to Wazirabad.\n\nRevenue.\n\nFrom the beginning of the lease in 1864 to the end of 1903-04, the revenue from the leased forests amounted to Rs. 73,38,000, and the expenditure to Rs. 69,24,000; this, however, includes the lease money and share of profits paid to the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Chamba.\n\nThe revenue, expenditure and surplus of the Division for the last five years are shown in the following table:\n\n| Year | Revenue | Expenditure | Surplus |\n|------|---------|-------------|---------|\n| 1904-05 | 3,75,301 | 88,033 | 2,87,268 |\n| 1905-06 | 2,69,955 | 89,322 | 1,70,633 |\n| 1906-07 | 2,22,740 | 61,443 | 1,61,303 |\n| 1907-08 | 1,87,173 | 41,808 | 1,45,365 |\n| 1908-09 | 2,02,531 | 48,140 | 1,54,391 |\n\nWorks of improvement\u2014such as the construction and repair of roads, buildings, improvement fellings, thinnings, cultural operations, etc., having for their object the improvement of the existing stock of deodar in the forests and its extension, are carried out in all the ranges. Sowings and plantings of deodar are also carried out in the Upper R\u00e1yi forests to the extent of about 50 acres a year, but these artificial reproduction works have not been attended with any great success.\n\nThe unclassed forests have not been demarcated or surveyed and their area is estimated to be about 65,000 acres. Part of this is valuable deodar-producing forest, but the greater portion is only of value for supplying the local wants of the people. These forests afford valuable summer grazing for sheep and buffaloes and a considerable revenue is obtained by the State from this source. Their protection is chiefly entrusted to the local k\u00e1rd\u00e1s and trees are not allowed to be cut without permission.\n\nThe rights of user in the reserved forests have been recorded in detail and rights of grazing, fodder, grass and building timber have been recorded in favour of the villages in the vicinity of the forests, but the forests are by no means overburdened with rights. In the unclassed forests the rights have not been recorded, and they are generally grazed free by the neighbouring villagers in the immediate vicinity of their homes. Large tracts of these forests are, however, auctioned yearly for sheep and buffalo grazing.\nThe forest vegetation of the State varies considerably, chiefly owing to elevation and rainfall. Starting from the S.W. boundary of the State, adjoining the Kangra and Gurdaspur districts\u2014along the Hathi dhar and the low hills between Dunera and Dalhousie\u2014the principal forest tree is the chil (Pinus longifolia). This species is found either as open forest mixed with scrub undergrowth, or as dense pure forest near Bakloh and Dalhousie. The chil is also found along the banks of the Siul and Ravi rivers up to an elevation of about 5,000 feet, and near Dalhousie is associated with the ban oak (Quercus incana) and brad (Rhododendron arboreum) up to 7,000 feet. Throughout the region of the lower hills the following trees are commonly met with: Tun (Cedrela toona), tali (Dalbergia sissoo), ber (Ziziphus jujuba), siris (Albizia sp.), kakarain (Pistacia intergerrima), simbal (Bombax malabaricum), bohr (Ficus bengalensis), pipal (Ficus religiosa), dhak (Butea frondosa), amaltas (Cassia fistula) and kral (Bauhinia), the last three being remarkable for their fine flowers.\n\nThe second region may be roughly described as the basin of the Ravi and Siul rivers in which, at elevations between 7,000 to 12,000 feet, the principal timber trees are the deodar (Cedrus lebani), the spruce or tos (Picea morinda) and the silver fir or rai (Abies Webbiana); throughout these forests the blue pine or kail (Pinus excelsa) is commonly found mixed with the deodar, and towards Brahmaur this tree becomes the principal species. The deodar is found either growing by itself to form pure forest, or mixed with its associated species, the blue pine and spruce, at elevations between 7,000 feet to 9,000 feet, and more rarely with the silver fir up to 10,000 feet. The great majority of the Chamba deodar forests are of the mixed type in which the deodar only forms a small proportion of the stock, being generally found along the ridges and spurs, the intervening hollows being occupied by the firs. In these forests natural reproduction of deodar is generally poor. Outside the deodar producing area there is a large extent of fir forest; sometimes mixed at higher elevations with the krao oak (Quercus semicarpifolia). These forests are chiefly of value as summer grazing grounds and for the protection they form to hill sides. They are also of use in conserving the water supply in springs and streams.\n\nIn this region three oaks are met with, the ban (Quercus incana), the mohru (Q. dilatata) and the krao (Q. semicarpifolia). The ban is generally found about 7,000 feet, the mohru between 7,000 and 9,000 feet and the krao at elevations up to 12,000 feet, where it sometimes forms pure forests. At 12,000 to 13,000 feet the bhoj or birch (Betula utilis) is found growing with the white rhododendron (R. campanulatum) and the stunted dhub (Juniperus recurva). All three oaks are eagerly lopped for fodder when in the vicinity of villages.\nThe other principal trees of this region are the walnut (akrot, khor), Juglans regia; elm (marar), Ulmus Wallichiana; maples (mandar), Acer sp.; horse chestnut (gun), Aesculus indica; hill t\u00e9n (daunt), Cedrela serrata; (khark), Celtis australis; (kakarain), Pistacia integerrima; (arkhol, titri), Rhus sp.; ash (sunnu), Fraxinus excelsior and floribunda; box (shamshaid), Buxus sempervirens; olive (kaul), Olea ferrugina; alder (piik), Alnus nepalensis and nitida; (chirindi), Litsea zehlanica; willows (bed), Salix sp.; poplars (sufeda, kanlu), Populus ciliata, hornbeam (chakhre), Carpinus sp.; yew (barni), Taxus baccata and (br\u00e1s) Rhododendron arboreum.\n\nThe third region to be described is the P\u00e1ng\u00ed valley. There the forests are found along the banks of the Chandra Bh\u00e1g\u00e1 river, here flowing at an elevation of 7,000 feet. Owing to its remoteness, and to the high passes over which the monsoon has to cross, the rainfall of this region is very much less than that of Chamba, and the character of the forest vegetation alters accordingly. In these forests the deod\u00e1r and blue pine are predominant, easily holding their own against the firs, which do not attain the same size as in Chamba proper and occupy a quite subordinate position. The deod\u00e1r and blue pine here grow in profusion, and there is no lack of natural reproduction in the forests. In the neighbourhood of Dharwas is also found the edible pine or chilgoza (Pinus gerardiana).\n\nThe following points peculiar to the vegetation of this country are worth notice:\u2014(1) There are no oaks although the elevations are suitable for them; (2) the birch (Betula utilis), in other places only found at the highest altitudes, here grows mixed with conifers at moderate elevations; (3) the prevalence of Fraxinus xylanthoides and F. excelsior, the ash, and also walnut trees which are cultivated in all the villages for the sake of the oil extracted from the nut. This is exported in large quantities to L\u00e1hul in exchange for wool.\n\nThe following is a list of the principal trees, shrubs and wood-climbers found in the State. It has been compiled from Mr. Lace's P\u00e1ng\u00ed working plan, Brandis' Indian Trees, and other sources; but the list is by no means exhaustive and does not pretend to include the whole flora of the country:\n\n| Natural order | Botanical name | Vernacular name | Remarks |\n|---------------|----------------|-----------------|---------|\n| Ranunculaceae | Clematis montana | Garol | Climbers.

Iron is found at Kul\u00e1l in P\u00e1ngi and in Brahmaur and Chur\u00e1b, and was worked to some extent in former days, but owing to the cheapness of imported iron operations have now entirely ceased. Mica is found in the Darw\u00e1s il\u00e1qa of P\u00e1ngi, and in other parts of the State. A tradition exists of a copper mine having been worked in the Hul porgana in the reign of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Prat\u00e9p Singh Varma (A.D. 1559-86), and the old workings may still be seen. Gold-washing is carried on at certain spots on the banks of the Chandrabh\u00e1g\u00e1 in P\u00e1ngi and Lah\u00fal, and the discovery more than 20 years ago of a sapphire mine in the neighbouring district of P\u00e1dar\u2014formerly Chamba territory\u2014suggests the probability of some parts of the State being rich in mineral wealth.

There is abundance of clay for the manufacture of ordinary pottery, and the inhabitants make all their own domestic utensils; but there is no export of such materials, as they are in no way better than those of neighbouring districts. Mineral springs exist in some parts of the State\u2014at Mothila, Saho, Udaipur, Kalhel and Manj\u00edr\u2014which are frequented by the people certain seasons, especially in Jeth and H\u00e1r; but the waters have not been analysed. They are chiefly hot and saline, the hottest probably being those at Mothila and Kalhel. Gypsum, called gach, is found near B\u00e1thri and is used locally by the villagers. It was at one time used in Chamba to make plaster of Paris for ceilings, but is not safe in earthquakes, and its use has now been abandoned.\n\nSection E.\u2014Arts and Manufactures.\n\nManufacture as a means of adding to the wealth of the State is almost unknown. All that the people do is to make whatever utensils they require for their day's work or household purposes. The blacksmith, the carpenter, the shoemaker, the brasssmith and the silversmith exist to supply the ordinary requirements of the village folk in general, and vessels of wood and stone are made in one or two places and sent as presents to friends. Some pretty silver ornaments are made in Chamba town. Zam\u00ednd\u00e1rs also weave blankets of pattu for their own use, not for sale to traders, nor can they be had ready made. All sheep are shorn when in the plains and the wool is sold to traders there. A rough kind of floor cloth called thobi is made from goat's hair in P\u00e1ngi. The thobis are woven in strips, of about 40 feet long and 9 to 11 inches wide, in a variety of colours, from natural dyes, some of which are very pleasing. For a floor cloth the strips are cut to the required length and sewn together.\n\nThe leather trade is chiefly in the hands of Cham\u00e1rs and they make their own leather from hides purchased in the State. Only a small quantity of leather is imported, chiefly from Amritsar, but it is superior to the local article, as the process of tanning is better understood on the plains. Leather shoes are in common use only in the capital and Sadr Wizarat and to a less extent in Brahmaur. In Chur\u00e1h bark shoes(1) are commonly worn, and grass shoes, called pull\u00e1n, in P\u00e1ngi and L\u00e1hul. But the use of leather shoes is spreading everywhere among those who can afford to buy them. Excellent chaplis or sandals are made in Chamba, which are generally regarded as superior to those made anywhere else in the hills.\n\n(1) These are made from the bark of the mahinda tree.\nIn the city of Chamba itself there is some very pretty embroidery work, called kasida, done by the women. Bright coloured silk threads are used, and the combination of colours is generally pretty in the extreme; some of the scenes from the Hindu epic poems are portrayed, with events in the life of Krishna. This work has deteriorated a good deal since the aniline dyes, which are easily procured, took the place of the natural dyes, used in former times. It is now very difficult to get specimens of the old work which are far superior to anything one sees now. The pattern is worked exactly the same on both sides.\n\nSome of the rooms in the Raji's palace are wonderfully decorated with oil paintings on the walls. Whole stories are shown in detail, and there are some splendid pictures of battles in which each single combat is drawn as carefully and circumstantially as if they were done from the descriptions in the Iliad. It is not known who was the artist, but it is unlikely that he was a native of Chamba. In the Bhuri Singh Museum there is a large collection of pictures, believed to be old, consisting of portraits and mythological subjects. They show that in Chamba, as in other Hill States in former times, the art of painting stood in high favour. For a full description of these paintings reference may be made to the Museum catalogue.\n\nBrickmaking as an industry does not exist in the State, stone being almost everywhere used for building purposes. In some parts of Bhattiyat sun-dried bricks are used, and in Chamba town the superstructure of the Rang Mahal is of burnt bricks.\n\nThere is an abundant supply of limestone in the State, from which lime is made. Most of the lime used in Chamba comes from the Saho and Hol Nalis, which cross the limestone outcrop. The kiln, called bhati, is a round structure roughly built, in the bottom of which a thick layer of fuel is laid. Over this the limestone boulders, broken small, are spread to a depth of 1\u00bd feet, and these layers are repeated alternately till the well is full. It is then closed in with a layer of earth plastered over with mud. At the bottom is an opening through which the kiln is lighted and it usually continues to burn for four or five days\u2014the process of cooling taking about the same time. The lime is then taken out and slaked and the cost, including carriage to Chamba, is from Rs. 55 to Rs. 60 per 100 mannds. In Dalhousie the cost is considerably greater.\n\nSection F.\u2014Commerce and Trade.\n\nTrade and commerce are very backward, chiefly owing to the fact that the State is very much cut off from the outer world; and also partly from the contented disposition of the inhabitants who, as a rule, gain sufficient by their vigorous toil to support life and generate their species. The common mode of conveyance is by\nponies, mules or bullocks, which bring up loads from the plains or outer hills and return with Chamba exports. They are usually the property of Kumbhars, who are the great carriers in the hills. Pangi and Lahul would be the chief beneficiaries of a brisk trade, but the roads seem to forbid all thought of large undertakings. Chamba sends various articles to Riblu, such as phullan,\\(^{(1)}\\) suil,\\(^{(2)}\\) honey, ghi, walnuts, rapeseed, quince-seed, kaur, til\\(^{(3)}\\) and apples, and receives in exchange Guma salt. Churah makes practically the same exports with the addition of banafsha and kuth (a root). To the plains are sent ghi, honey, potatoes, suil, phullan, bajor-bhang, kuth, thuth (a root), dhup (incense), nari\u00e1n (for hooka stems), walnuts, walnut bark, zira (cummin), banafsha (violets), apples, pears, lal-mirch (cayenne pepper), beeswax, khaskhas (poppy seeds), dhanya (coriander), kaur (a root), sukri (dried apricots), attis (medicine), dode (soapnuts), thangi (hazelnuts) and chilgoza or edible pine. There is a large export of fruit of every kind, during the season, to Dalhousie, and the export of wheat and other food stuffs is controlled by a tariff at the bridges over the Ravi to prevent depletion, which would cause scarcity. Most of the ordinary articles on sale in the bazar are imported from the plains and the outer hills, and the export and import trade is chiefly in the hands of the banya class, who are shopkeepers and money-lenders. In the hot weather the Gujars, who temporarily settle in the hills, carry on a brisk trade in ghi. Some villagers carry ghi and honey to Shahpur in the Gurdaspur District, and bring back salt. Chamba itself is a busy market\u2014the bazar presenting a cheerful vision of industry and thrift. The shops are remarkably clean and neat and no signs of poverty are evident. Many of the shopkeepers are Muhammadaus while Khanna and Co. of Dalhousie have a large agency in Chamba. Salt and brasswork are the principal articles dealt in, and cheap country jewellery, of which the natives are extremely fond, is sold in the majority of the shops.\n\nWoollen patt\u00fas are made in all parts of the State and are exported occasionally via Shahpur. Pangi produces these patt\u00fas along with thobis, in a small quantity and exports them with zira or cummin, kuth, thangi, edible pine, tilla (sweet patt\u00eds) and banchauk\\(^{(4)}\\); there was once an export trade in Pangi hops, but this has now entirely ceased. The hops were sent to the brewery at Murree.\n\nThe trade of Lahul is confined to the export of black cummin and a few hill ponies. Brahmaur exports honey, ghi, rams, he-goats, kuth and walnuts. The Bhattiy\u00e1t only exports rice (basmati-oryza sativa) and ghi.\n\n---\n\n\\(^{(1)}\\) Fagopyrum emarginatum.\n\n\\(^{(2)}\\) Amaranthus acerba.\n\n\\(^{(3)}\\) Sesamum Indicum.\n\n\\(^{(4)}\\) A small seed, like cummin, used for adulteration.\nSection G.\u2014Communications.\n\nThere is no line of railway in the State; the nearest station of the North-Western Railway is Path\u00e1nkot, distant from Chamba 70 miles via Dalhousie; 50 miles via N\u00farpur; and 57 miles via Sindh\u00e1ra.\n\nThere are no ferries in the State; a ferry formerly existed on the Siul river near Manjir, but was discontinued on the completion of the new road via the Kothi Bridge.\n\nThe R\u00e1vi and Siul can be crossed at many spots by dries.\n\nThe tonga and cart-road from Path\u00e1nkot to Dalhousie is the only metalled road within the confines of the State; and it is British territory, with a width of 80 feet. The road from Bakloh to Dalhousie is also British territory, but is only 8 feet in width.\n\nThere are about 324 miles of unmetalled roads in the State, forming the main lines of communication, with an average width of 4 feet. In addition there are numerous tracks, fit only for pedestrians, some parts of which are fairly good, while others are rough and difficult.\n\nIn P\u00e1ngi and other parts of the State even the main roads are for the most part narrow and dangerous.\n\nThe roads and public buildings are all maintained by the State.\n\nApproach Routes.\u2014There are three main lines of road to Chamba from the plains, all of them diverging from Path\u00e1nkot, not to re-unite till they reach the suspension bridge over the R\u00e1vi, close to the town. They are named, respectively, the Dalhousie, Sindh\u00e1ra and Ch\u00fa\u00e1ri roads.\n\nDalhousie Road.\u2014The road in most common use, especially in summer, is the tonga and cart-road from Path\u00e1nkot to Dalhousie. This road has been in existence only since the founding of the Hill Station of Dalhousie, in A.D. 1852, and was not completed till some years later. After traversing the outer Siw\u00e1l\u00edks to Dunera it enters State territory on the summit of the H\u00e1thi Dh\u00e1r, and runs round the shoulder of the Bakloh spur to Karundi. It then passes Banikhet and ascends by the Balun spur to Dalhousie. This road is British territory.\n\nBranch Roads.\u2014The following branch roads leave the Dalhousie road:\n\n(1) At the 16th mile from Dalhousie a branch ascends to Bakloh and runs on by Mamul to Dalhousie, ending at the Post Office. As already stated this road is also British territory.\n\n(2) At Banikhet another branch diverges on the left to join the Sindh\u00e1ra road at Pukher.\n\nScenery.\n\nAt Dalhousie the crest of the Dh\u00e1ula-Dh\u00e1r is gained, and from a point of vantage at this altitude, or from Dayan Kund at 9,000 feet, a magnificent panorama is spread out before one. To the south are the ridges and valleys of the Siw\u00e1l\u00edks, running parallel to one another, and becoming more indistinct.\nas they recede towards the plains. In the far distance may be seen, on a clear day, three of the great rivers of the Punjab,\u2014the R\u00e1vi, Bias and Satluj\u2014glittering in the sunshine, and losing themselves in the plains beyond which seem to melt away into infinite space.\n\nTurning to the north the gaze rests on an amphitheatre of lofty ranges, with a foreground of mountain and valley, forest, gorge and stream. Closing in the horizon to the west and north-west are the rounded summits of the Kund Kap-l\u00e1s and D\u00e1gani Dh\u00e1r, which in summer are entirely free of snow.\n\nTo the north and east the snowy pinnacles of the P\u00e1ngi Range stretch out in majestic array, many of them rising to an altitude of 18,000 and 19,000 feet. Towering up from behind them are two lofty peaks usually covered with snow, one slightly rounded and the other pointed and precipitous\u2014which among Europeans are known as the Bride and the Bridegroom. These are in the Gurdh\u00e1r range in P\u00e1ngi and are about 18,500 and 20,658 feet, respectively, in altitude; the latter being almost the highest peak in the State. Far to the east the eye can trace the line of the Dh\u00e1ula-Dh\u00e1r, till the range is lost in a mighty maze of snowy mountains; chief among which is the Kail\u00e1s at whose base rests the sacred lake of Mani Mahes. Within this wide expanse it is easy to detect the tortuous course of the R\u00e1vi gorge, though not more than a mere glimpse of the river can anywhere be seen. The Siul also is hidden from view, but a considerable part of the open valley is clearly visible, as well as the general trend of its many converging tributaries from the snowy range. Finally, all over the valleys and mountain slopes are scattered the hamlets of the peasantry\u2014each in its own area of cultivation\u2014lending an additional charm to the landscape, and presenting a fascinating picture of rural beauty and repose.\n\nThere are four roads from Dalhousie to Chamba, named, respectively, the Khaji\u00e1r, Kolhri, Chil and B\u00e1thri roads.\n\nKhaji\u00e1r Road.\u2014The Khaji\u00e1r road starts from the Post Office and rising to Bakrot\u00e1 and K\u00e1l\u00e1top, winds through a dense forest of pine and cedar to Khaji\u00e1r\u2014a sylvan glade of great beauty. On the brink of a small lake stands an ancient shrine to Kh\u00e1ji N\u00e1g, from which the place takes its name; a soft green sward slopes on all sides towards the lake, and the glade is encircled by a forest of cedars which stand out in stately array. Khaji\u00e1r is 6,300 feet above sea level and during the season is much frequented by visitors. From there the road runs for a short distance on the level, and then descending rapidly the R\u00e1vi Valley is suddenly displayed to view, with Chamba far below nestling like a fairy paradise in the bosom of the mountains. Reaches of the R\u00e1vi are visible in the vicinity of the town, and to the south the valley seems closed in by a high granite peak of the Dh\u00e1ula-Dh\u00e1r, named Kankot, which for nine months in the year is covered with snow. The road then drops by an easy gradient to the R\u00e1vi, and having crossed by the suspension bridge ascends to the town.\n\nThe distance from Dalhousie to Chamba is 19 miles.\n\nThe Khaji\u00e1r road is usually closed with snow from December to April. There are d\u00e1k bungalows at Khaji\u00e1r and Chamba, but the former is closed for some months in winter.\nKolhri Road.\u2014The Kolhri road is an alternative route to Chamba, 22 miles in length. Leaving Dalhousie at the Post Office it runs with a gentle gradient, to Kolhri, and descending to the R\u00e1vi joins the Sindh\u00e1ra road at Udaipur.\n\nChil Road.\u2014At the 7th mile on the Kolhri road a cross road runs on the level to Chil, and connects the Kolhri and Sindh\u00e1ra roads. The route to Chamba via Chil is 20 miles.\n\nB\u00e1thri Road.\u2014The B\u00e1thri road, after leaving the Post Office, descends to the B\u00e1thri Valley, to join the Sindh\u00e1ra road at B\u00e1thri. Being mostly at a low level it is much used in winter, when the other roads are usually under snow. The distance to Chamba is 20 miles. The Kolhri and B\u00e1thri roads are more exposed and less interesting than the Khaji\u00e1r road, and are, therefore, little frequented by travellers in summer, though much used for mule transport.\n\nSindh\u00e1ra Road.\u2014The Sindh\u00e1ra road is an ancient line of communication with the plains, probably dating from the very earliest times.\n\nIt first touches the R\u00e1vi at Sh\u00e1hpur, and following up the left bank by Phangota, enters Chamba at Kairi. At Sindh\u00e1ra it leaves the river and ascends the hill to the Gaggidh\u00e1r ridge north of Dalhousie, where a branch from Banikhet connects it with the Dalhousie road. Sinking into the B\u00e1thri valley it rises again to cross the Chil spur, and descending rejoins the R\u00e1vi at Udaipur, and runs up its left bank to the suspension bridge. The distance from Path\u00e1nkot to Chamba via Sindh\u00e1ra is 57 miles, and via Dunera, Banikhet and B\u00e1thri, 65 miles. Since the opening of the Dalhousie road this route has fallen into disuse for through traffic; but the portion from Chamba to Banikhet is much used in winter. The scenery on the R\u00e1vi, between Sh\u00e1hpur and Sindh\u00e1ra, is picturesque and interesting; but the road is rough, and in places dangerous for laden animals.\n\nThere are State rest-houses at Sindh\u00e1ra, B\u00e1thri and Chil.\n\nBranch Roads.\u2014The following branch roads leave the Sindh\u00e1ra road:\n\n1. A branch road goes from B\u00e1thri to the Cha\u00far\u00e1l Bridge, and after crossing the R\u00e1vi, runs up the right bank of the Siul, by Bhalai, to join the Bhadraw\u00e1h road at Kothi Bridge. From the Cha\u00far\u00e1l Bridge a branch ascends to Gal\u00ed and drops to the Siowa stream which it follows via Banaird to Bani in Balaur. These roads are rough and unfit for ponies or laden animals.\n\nChu\u00e1ri Road.\u2014The Chu\u00e1ri road is also an ancient line of communication with the plains.\n\nLeaving the Kangra Valley road at N\u00farpur it runs north into the low hills, in the direction of the Dh\u00e1ula-Dh\u00e1r, and near Maluk\u00e1l enters Chamba. From this point it follows the bed of the Chakki for four miles. At Ghat\u00e1sn\u00ed it leaves the Chakki and rises over a spur to reach Chu\u00e1ri; and after crossing the Dh\u00e1ula-Dh\u00e1r by the Chu\u00e1ri or Basodan Pass, emerges into the R\u00e1vi Valley opposite the town of Chamba. The portion in the bed of the Chakki is rough, but otherwise the road is good throughout. The distance from Path\u00e1nkot to Chamba is only 50 miles, and is thus shorter than by either of the other routes. This road is used all the year round, but the fording of the Chakki during the rains is often difficult and dangerous. After heavy rain the stream may be impassable for a day or two, and accidents with loss of life occasionally occur. In winter the Chu\u00e1ri Pass\nis usually under snow for two or three months, but the road is seldom closed to pedestrians for more than a few days at a time. Above Jajjari may be seen the ruins of Taragarh Fort built by Raja Jagat Singh of Nurpur, A.D. 1625\u201430.\n\nBranch Roads.\u2014The following branch roads leave the Chuari road:\n\n(1) From Chuari a branch road runs by Sihunt\u00e9 to Shahpur in the Kangra Valley. The distance from Chamba to Dharmasala or Kangra by this route is about 54 miles; but some of the streams are not bridged, and difficulty may be experienced in fording them during the rains; otherwise the road is good.(1)\n\n(2) From Chuari one branch runs to Bakloh, distant 10 miles, and another via Dura-sappar to Dalhousie, 16 miles; and from the top of the Chuari Pass one road runs to the rest-house at Kainthli and another follows the ridge of the Dhaula Dhar, via Dayan Kund and Kalatop, to Dalhousie, 19 miles, joining the Khajjar road at the wood-sheds.\n\nThere are State rest-houses at Chuari, Sihunt\u00e9, and Kainthli.\n\nMain routes in interior.\u2014The main routes into the interior of the State diverge from the capital; the two principal roads running, the one up and the other down the Ravi Valley.\n\nBrahmaur Road.\u2014The Brahmaur road runs up the right bank of the Ravi to Rakhi and the Bagga bridge where it crosses and continues on to Gehra. To this point it is level, but here the new road ends, and the line reverts to the old road which ascends the slope to reach Chhatrar\u00ed. When the new level road was commenced, in 1878, the alignment was carried as far as Brahmaur, but the road was not completed owing to the cost it would have involved.\n\nBeyond Chhatrar\u00ed the road descends to the Chirchind Nala and rises by a long ascent to Kothi and the Sarali Pass (9,000 feet). It then drops to Ulans\u00e1, and the left bank of the Ravi at Gurola, and having crossed rises to Khani, whence it passes on up the Budhil Valley to Brahmaur. An old and rough track, shown on the maps, runs direct from Chhatrar\u00ed to Ulans\u00e1. Harser is the next stage and so far the road is good, but from there to Kukt\u00ed it is narrow and rough most of the way.\n\nFrom Kukt\u00ed the road crosses the Kukt\u00ed Pass to Jobrang in British Lahul, and Jarma is reached by a jhula over the Chandrabhaga.\n\nBranch Roads.\u2014The following branch roads leave the Brahmaur road:\n\n(1) At Mahla a branch crosses the Ravi by a wire suspension bridge and runs up the left bank, at a high level, to Baka, Basu and Gehra. This was the main road previous to the completion of the new level road and is still in good condition, though little used. From Mahla also two roads ascend the Mabledi Nala to cross the Kali Nali and Mahli Passes, respectively, in the Dhaula Dhar, the first to Raipur and the second to Tundi; and a third ascends the Durged Nala from Daruh and crosses the Loa Pass to Tikri in Bhatriyat.\n\n(1) Near the Chamba border may be seen the ruins of the ancient fort of Ganeshgarh, erected by Raja Ganesh Varma about A.D. 1560.\nCHAP. II.G.\n\n(2) From R\u00e1kh a branch ascends the Bak\u00e1n\u00ed N\u00e1l\u00e1 and crosses the Boh\u00e1r Pass to Boh in Rihl\u00e1. There is a rest-house at Kh\u00e1rpok.\n\n(3) At Churi Bridge a branch crosses to the right bank of the R\u00e1vi and joins the road from Jamw\u00e1r and Chiminu to Lihl, M\u00e1nda, and Brahmaur.\n\n(4) From Dan\u00e1li a branch ascends the Baleni N\u00e1l\u00e1 to Barai, and joins the road from Bas\u00fa, which crosses the Baleni Pass to Dareni in Rihl\u00e1. There is a rest-house at Barai.\n\n(5) From Kothi a branch runs up the Chirchind N\u00e1l\u00e1 and crosses the Bag or Bhimgasutari Pass to Kareri in Rihl\u00e1, but being somewhat difficult is seldom used. A rough track from Kothi crosses the Grij\u00e1h\u00e1r Pass to Chanota and a branch runs from the top of the pass along the ridge to Ku\u00e1rs\u00ed and the Indr\u00e1h\u00e1r Pass.\n\n(6) At Brahmaur a branch descends to cross the Budhil and then rises to Tat\u00e1hn. Here it is joined by a branch from Khani, and then runs up the Tund\u00e1h Valley to Badr\u00e1 and Banaser. From Tat\u00e1hn the road is only a hill track and very rough. Coolies for Trilokn\u00e1th via the Kalichu Pass are engaged at Badra, and the journey takes three days.\n\n(7) From Brahmaur a branch crosses to the right bank of the Budhil and runs on to Chobia; here coolies are engaged for the Chobia Pass leading to Trilokn\u00e1th.\n\n(8) From Brahmaur another branch runs by Grima to Shear and Ti\u00e1ri; and at the latter place crosses the R\u00e1vi to join the Bara Bang\u00e1hal road at Holi. This road is good except a small part on the bank of the R\u00e1vi near Ti\u00e1ri.\n\n(9) From Harser a rough track ascends to the Mani Mahesh lake, and crosses the ridge to Ti\u00e1ri in the R\u00e1vi Valley.\n\n(10) From Kukti a branch, after crossing the Budhil, ascends the G\u00e1f ravine and crosses the Chobu Pass to Bara Bang\u00e1hal.\n\nBara Bang\u00e1hal Road.\u2014From Ul\u00e1nsa the road follows up the left bank of the R\u00e1vi to Bara Bang\u00e1hal. The stages are Chanota, Holi, Garoh, Chanair, Sind, Kanaur and Bara Bang\u00e1hal. This road is fit for pedestrians only, and in many places is rough and dangerous, especially between Chanair and Bang\u00e1hal.\n\nBranch roads.\n\nFrom the Bang\u00e1hal road the following branches diverge to cross the remaining passes in the Dh\u00e1ula Dh\u00e1r to the Kangra Valley:\n\n(1) From Chanota a rough road runs up the Choli N\u00e1l\u00e1 to Ku\u00e1rs\u00ed and crosses the Indr\u00e1h\u00e1r Pass to Dharm\u00e1s\u00e1la.\n\n(2) From Ku\u00e1rs\u00ed a rough track crosses the Kundl\u00ed Pass to Kaniy\u00e1ra but is seldom used.\n\n(3) From Lam\u00fa a very rough track runs up to the Toral Pass, which it crosses to Narw\u00e1na.\n\n(4) From Holi a branch, seldom used, ascends the Holi N\u00e1l\u00e1 and crosses the T\u00e1lang Pass to Narw\u00e1na.\n\n(5) From near Garoh a branch runs up the Kuredh N\u00e1l\u00e1, and crosses the Singr\u00e1h\u00e1r Pass to Kandi, north of P\u00e1lampur.\n\n(6) From Chanair a road passes up the Tanaiter N\u00e1l\u00e1, and crosses the Satn\u00e1lo Pass to Bandla, near P\u00e1lampur, but is very little used.\n\n(7) Another road from Chanair runs up the left bank of the Channi N\u00e1l\u00e1 and crosses the W\u00e1har Pass to Baudla, and a third, going by Sarai\n\n---\n\n(1) From Bara Bang\u00e1hal three roads cross the Thams\u00e9r (16,025 feet), Ganri and Makori passes, respectively, in the Dh\u00e1ula Dh\u00e1r to Chhota Bang\u00e1hal; and a fourth road crosses the Bara Bang\u00e1hal Range by the K\u00e1l Him Pass (17,000 feet) to Dhubi in Kulu. The road by the Bara Bang\u00e1hal Pass (18,000 feet), in the Mid-Himalaya to British Lahul, is now never used.\nfollows up the right bank of the same Nala and crosses the Sarai Pass to Baijuath.\n\nThere are State rest-houses at Mahla, Rakh, Karpok, Chhatrari, Ulansa and Brahmasar.\n\nPangi Road.\u2014The Pangi road on leaving Chamba descends to the Sal Nala which it crosses to reach the right bank of the Ravi.\n\nAt Kiyani it leaves the river and ascends a ravine to Pukhri, on the watershed between the Ravi and the Siul. Continuing to rise to Masrud it drops by a steep descent to cross the Karair Nala, and again rising winds along the slopes overhanging the Siul to the rest-house at Kalhel. Here it descends to cross the Kalhel stream, and regaining its former elevation runs on the level till it drops again to the Nakror bridge where it crosses the Chanju Nala. It then winds along the slopes for some distance and crossing the Tisa Nala ascends to Tisa. From the top of the ridge above Tisa the road gradually descends to the Baira Nala which it crosses at Guari. (1) It then runs up the Alwas Nala to Tharela, and a few miles on reaches Alwas. Here coolies are engaged for the S\u00e1ch Pass, which is crossed in three marches to Kil\u00e1r in Pangi. The intermediate stages are Silrundi and Donci or Bindr\u00e1ban.\n\nNear Dhid the road enters the main Pangi Valley, and crossing the Chandrabh\u00e1ga by a wooden bridge ascends to Kil\u00e1r.\n\nThe Pangi road is good all the way, except for the toilsome ascents and descents at the different tributaries of the Siul. Ponies can go as far as Alwas and may cross the pass in July, and later, but are of little use in Pangi; laden animals can go as far as Tisa; but are not usually taken beyond Masrud.\n\nThere are State-rest-houses at Pukhri, Masrud, Kalhel, Tisa, Rest-houses, Alwas, Bindr\u00e1ban and Kil\u00e1r.\n\nBranch Roads.\u2014The following branch roads leave the Pangi Branch roads, Road:\n\n(1) At Kiyani a track runs to Rajnagar and crossing the end of the Sah\u00f3 Range descends by Tariod to the Siul to reach Bhulai. The river is spanned by a gururu or rope suspension bridge at Palai; road rough.\n\n(2) From Kalhel a branch ascends the Kalhel Nala to Chatri rest-house and crosses the Sah\u00f3 Range to Sil\u00e1h Gr\u00e1t in the Hul Valley. This is a fairly good road.\n\n(3) At the top of the descent to the Nakror bridge, a road leaves, on the right and runs up the Chanju Nala at a high level to Jasaur and Bagai, joining the following road; but is rough.\n\n(4) From Tisa a road runs by Tikri to Bagai, and Chanju and is fairly good most of the way. (2) From Bagai a branch ascends the Charar Nala to cross the Marhu (Charar) Pass, to Tindi in Chamba-Lahul; and from Chanju a good road leads up to the Dr\u00fati Pass and also crosses to Tindi; the journey in each case taking three days.\n\n(1). An old track runs from Bairs along the ridge by Gudia to Alwas; it is passable but little used.\n\n(2). A branch descends from Tikri and joins the Pangi road at the Nakror bridge.\n(5) From Tisa one road runs to Himgari and another ascends the Tisa N\u00e1l\u00e1 to the B\u00e1ra rest-house. From the top of the ridge above Tisa a road runs up the B\u00e1ra N\u00e1l\u00e1 to Debri Kothi; and then on to Hail, and crosses the Cheni pass to Mindhal in P\u00e1ngi. The road is fairly good except on the pass, which is precipitous on the south side.\n\n(6) Opposite Sai Kothi a branch descends to the Bair\u00e1 stream and crosses to Sai. From Sai one road ascends the Barnota N\u00e1l\u00e1 to Bag\u00f3r, Barnota and Makan; and crosses the Bar\u00e1ri Pass to Jagesar in Baleasa. Another road runs up the Alw\u00e1s N\u00e1l\u00e1 to Tharela, and joins the main road to Alw\u00e1s. From the bridge over the Mangli stream a branch runs to Mangli and crosses the Mailw\u00e1r pass to Baleasa; all these roads are in fairly good condition for pedestrians but are not suitable for ponies.\n\n(7) From Alw\u00e1s a rough track, used by sportsmen, runs up the Jamuni N\u00e1l\u00e1 to the D\u00e1gani Dh\u00e1r and crosses the Nirangw\u00e1ri Pass to Nirangw\u00e1ri and Guintrer in Bhunjw\u00e1r. From Silrundi a road ascends to the Danetar or Gillu Pass in the P\u00e1ngi Range and crosses to Chitoa in P\u00e1dar.\n\n**Bhadraw\u00e1h Road.**\u2014The Bhadraw\u00e1h road leaves the P\u00e1ngi road at Pukhri, eight miles from Chamba, and descends a narrow ravine to the Kothi bridge over the Siul river. After crossing it rises to Saluni, on the Prithvijor ridge, separating the upper and lower portions of the Siul. From there it gradually descends to the Pala bridge and after crossing runs on to Gaggal near Kih\u00e1r. There it re-crosses to the right bank and follows it up to Bh\u00e1ndal which is reached by a bridge near that place. The whole of this line, from Suudla near the Kothi bridge to Bh\u00e1ndal, is new.\n\nThe old line from Sundla runs up the right bank of the Siul to Manj\u00edr, where it rises to Saluni, and descends to cross the Siul at the Kalor bridge, rejoining the new line at Pala bridge. From Bh\u00e1ndal the old road runs up the left bank of the Siul to Langer\u00e1 and is in places very rough. From Langer\u00e1 the road rises to cross the Padari Pass and descends rapidly to Than\u00e1la in Bhadraw\u00e1h. The State boundary is at Kundi Mar\u00e1l, five miles from Langer\u00e1.\n\nThe Bhadraw\u00e1h road is very good, with an easy gradient, as far as Bh\u00e1ndal, and when completed pack animals will be able to go all the way to Langer\u00e1. Riding ponies go through to Bhadraw\u00e1h, but the road on the Padari Pass is rough and unsafe for laden animals.\n\nThere are State rest-houses at Pukhri, Sundla, Manj\u00edr, Saluni, Kalor, Bh\u00e1ndal, Chadbhent and Langer\u00e1.\n\n**Branch Roads.**\u2014The following branch roads leave the Bhadraw\u00e1h road:\n\n(1) From Kothi bridge a rough track rises to Jhund, and follows up the Sal\u00e1ngri N\u00e1l\u00e1 to Band\u00e1r in Balaur.\n\n(2) From Manj\u00edr a rough road crosses the Prithvijor ridge and descends to the Siul to reach Himgari.\n(3) From Saluni a road runs up the crest of the Prithvijor ridge to Kalor rest-house, and then descends to a point opposite Bh\u00e1ndal, which is reached by a bridge over the Siul.\n\n(4) From Kih\u00e1r a fairly good road runs to Diyur and H\u00edmgari, and then crosses the Barnota N\u00e1l\u00e1 to reach Sai. From Diyur on this road, a branch crosses the ridge to Kh\u00e1ngu rest-house, and descends to the Barnota N\u00e1l\u00e1 to join the road from Sai to Makan. From H\u00edmgari another branch descends to cross the Chandresh N\u00e1l\u00e1 and joins the P\u00e1ngi road near the Nakror bridge.\n\n(5) From Bh\u00e1ndal a road ascends the Sangni N\u00e1l\u00e1 to Gamgul, and crosses the D\u00e1gani Dh\u00e1r Pass to Bhanencha in Balesa. The road is good as far as Gamgul, but rough onwards.\n\nThese roads are all fairly good for pedestrians but unfit for ponies.\n\nS\u00e1ho Road.\u2014The S\u00e1ho road also starts from the capital, and after crossing the S\u00e1l N\u00e1l\u00e1 runs up its right bank to S\u00e1ho.\n\nFrom S\u00e1ho it ascends the Keri N\u00e1l\u00e1 and crosses the Panjungla Range to Sacraina, and over another low range to Bailj; finally crossing the Tund\u00e1h Range by the Bagair Pass to M\u00e1nda. From there one branch crosses the Tundahen N\u00e1l\u00e1 to Badra and the Kalicho Pass; and another branch runs to Bargr\u00e1 and Brahmaur. Ponies can go to S\u00e1ho, where there is a rest-house; beyond this the road is very rough.\n\n(1) From Chiminu a branch leaves the S\u00e1ho road and crosses the S\u00e1l stream. It then runs up the Jamw\u00e1r ravine to the summit of the ridge, where it joins the Jamw\u00e1r road.\n\n(2) From Chiminu another branch leaves the S\u00e1ho road and runs up the Hul N\u00e1l\u00e1 to Silahgr\u00e1t, it then crosses the S\u00e1ho range at Banatu and descends to Bhangor and Lunek in the Ch\u00e1nju N\u00e1l\u00e1; joining the road from Ch\u00e1nju to the Dr\u00e1ti Pass. This road is good almost all the way. Another road runs from Bhangor to Bagai and joins the road to the Marhu Pass. Ponies and pack animals go as far as Silahgr\u00e1t.\n\n(3) From S\u00e1ho a branch road crosses the S\u00e1ho range and descends to the Ch\u00e1nju N\u00e1l\u00e1 joining the road to the Dr\u00e1ti Pass at Kalpra. This road is fairly good to the top of the pass, but the descent is rough.\n\nJamw\u00e1r Road.\u2014From Chamba also a road rises to Jamw\u00e1r and runs along the crest of the Jamw\u00e1r ridge till it meet the road from Chiminu. It then descends to Lilh and Guh and follows up the Beljedi N\u00e1l\u00e1 by Batot to Girir; finally crossing the Tund\u00e1h range by the Jhundal Pass to M\u00e1nda, and on by Bargr\u00e1 to Brahmaur. Ponies can go as far as Jamw\u00e1r, and the road is good; but onwards it is very rough. There is a State bungalow at Jamw\u00e1r for which special permission is necessary.\nMain road in Pangi. The main road in Pangi is a continuation of that from Kashtw\u00e1r and P\u00e1dar, and enters Pangi at the jh\u00fala over the Sans\u00e1ri N\u00e1l\u00e1.\n\nRising to Darw\u00e1s it crosses the Sur\u00e1l N\u00e1l\u00e1 and runs up the right bank of the Chandrabh\u00e1ga, at a high level, to Kil\u00e1r. There it crosses the Hun\u00e1n stream and gradually drops to the bank of the main river at Siddh-ka-dera and farther on passes through a narrow chasm where the planking, forming the roadway, is supported on iron bars fixed in the face of the cliff.\n\nThe Parmaur and Saichu N\u00e1l\u00e1s are crossed near Cheri, on the river bank below S\u00e1ch.\n\nAt Mindhal bridge the road passes to the left bank and runs on the level to Purthi.\n\nThe Cheni and Shil\u00e1l streams are bridged by tr\u00e1ngaris, and on a rock near the latter stream are the glacial markings referred to on page 26 of the Gazetteer. At Purthi the river is crossed by a wooden bridge to reach the Forest rest-house; while the main road runs on by Ajog to the jh\u00fala at Shor. The scenery all the way from Kil\u00e1r to Shor is exceedingly beautiful.\n\nThe road from Kil\u00e1r to Shor was made in 1869-70, and is fairly good all the way, except at four spots where special care is necessary; these are, at the rocky chasm near Phindru; from Cheri to Mindhal bridge; on the approach to Purthi; and between Purthi and Shor.\n\nThe old road ascends from the Parmaur N\u00e1l\u00e1 to S\u00e1ch, and after crossing the Saichu N\u00e1l\u00e1 rises steeply through forest to reach the higher mountain slopes, along which it runs to Reh and Purthi, rejoining the lower road at the Shor jh\u00fala. Except for a short distance to the east of Reh this road though toilsome is good, and from it fine views are obtained of the main valley. There is a picturesque bridge over the Mujar N\u00e1l\u00e1 near Purthi.\n\nFrom Shor the road follows up the left bank at a high level to Toth\u00e1l, a small flat opposite the point where the Karun N\u00e1l\u00e1 joins the river, and is in some places difficult.\n\nBeyond Toth\u00e1l it runs along the face of the precipices overhanging the Chandrabh\u00e1ga to Rauli, and for most of the way is narrow and dangerous. Between Rauli and Tindi the road is fairly good. From Tindi to the Harser N\u00e1l\u00e1 is an open flat, but the rest of the way to Silgr\u00e1on is along the face of the cliff and somewhat difficult. At Silgr\u00e1on the road crosses to the right bank, and except at the Kurcher N\u00e1l\u00e1 and one other spot, is narrow and dangerous all the way to the Darer N\u00e1l\u00e1 near Margr\u00e1on. At Margr\u00e1on the Urgad N\u00e1l\u00e1 is crossed and from this point the valley is open and the road good. At Udeipur the Miy\u00e1r N\u00e1l\u00e1 is crossed by a wooden\nbridge, and Triloknath, on the left bank, is reached by a bridge over the main river. Another bridge above Triloknath carries the road back to the right bank, along which it runs to the border at Tirot and then to British Lahul and Kulu. The Tirot Nala is crossed by a wooden bridge.\n\nThere are State rest-houses at Darwas, Kil\u00e1r, S\u00e1ch and Purthi, with small huts at Cheri and Rauli.\n\nBranch roads.\u2014The following branch roads leave the main road in P\u00e1ngi:\n\n(1) From Darwas a branch ascends the Sur\u00e1l N\u00e1l\u00e1 and crosses the Sarank Pass into the Danlong N\u00e1l\u00e1.\n\n(2) A similar branch from Kil\u00e1r runs up the Hun\u00e1n N\u00e1l\u00e1 and crosses the Shinkil Pass; the two roads unite in the Danlong N\u00e1l\u00e1 and cross the Kang La in the Western Himalaya or Zanskar Range to Bardan Gompa in Zanskar, the whole journey taking five days.\n\n(3) From S\u00e1ch a branch ascends the Saichu N\u00e1l\u00e1 to Saichu and Tuan and crosses the Mun La to the Danlong N\u00e1l\u00e1, the road then crosses the Poat La in the Western Himalaya and joins the previous road to Bardan Gompa.\n\n(4) In the Saichu N\u00e1l\u00e1 an upper road runs from Katal near S\u00e1ch to Shan and rejoins the previous road at Hilu, but is rough and in places dangerous.\n\n(5) From Saichu a branch runs up the Chasag N\u00e1l\u00e1 to Bhotaur and crosses the Gurdh\u00e1r Pass to the Miy\u00e1r N\u00e1l\u00e1. This pass is so named owing to its being passable for ponies, which are brought from Lahul by this route to P\u00e1ngi and over the S\u00e1ch Pass to Chamba.\n\n(6) At Udaipur a branch runs up the Miy\u00e1r N\u00e1l\u00e1 and is narrow and difficult for four miles. From Chimrat the valley is open and the road good, up to the head of the valley, where it crosses the Kang La in the Western Himalaya to Bardan Gompa in Zanskar. The journey from Kanjer, the last village, occupies five days.\n\n(7) Beyond Kanjer a branch ascends a side n\u00e1l\u00e1 to cross the Th\u00e1rang La to the head of the Kado Tokpo stream. The journey to Darcha in British Lahul takes four days.\n\nPonies and laden animals come down the main valley as far as Margri\u00f3n; below this point the roads are passable only for sheep, which are utilized to carry grain, salt, etc., to and from different places in the valley and over the passes in the P\u00e1ngi Range.\n\nIn addition to the main lines of road there are in all parts of the State, but especially in the R\u00e9vi Valley, numerous by-paths in every valley, and from one valley to another, which are known to, and used by, the villagers.\n\n---\n\n(1) In former times a considerable amount of the Central Asian trade from Path\u00e1nkot and N\u00farpur came over the S\u00e1ch and Obeni Passes, to P\u00e1ngi; and went on by routes, (1), (2), (8); and also by P\u00e1d\u00e1r and the Um\u00e1i Pass to Zanskar and Lad\u00e1kh. Toll was levied at N\u00farpur and Chamba.\n### V.\u2014Passes in the North P\u00e1ngi Range,(1) in order from the North-West.\n\n| Name of Pass | Remarks |\n|--------------|---------|\n| Sarsank      | Between Sur\u00e1l N\u00e1l\u00e1 and Danlong N\u00e1l\u00e1; height about 16,200 feet; large glacier, road difficult, takes two days from Kansar. |\n| Shikul       | Between Hun\u00e1n N\u00e1l\u00e1 and Danlong N\u00e1l\u00e1; height about 16,300 feet; road very difficult and seldom used. |\n| Mun La       | Between Tu\u00e1n in Saichu N\u00e1l\u00e1 and Danlong N\u00e1l\u00e1; height about 16,500 feet; very difficult and seldom used. |\n\nThe first two roads unite in the Danlong N\u00e1l\u00e1 and then cross the Kag Pass to Bardan Gompa in Zansk\u00e1r; the third road crosses the Poat La and joins the first two roads in Zansk\u00e1r. Passes open July, August and September, and the whole journey takes five days.\n\n### VI.\u2014Passes in the Western Him\u00e1laya or Zansk\u00e1r Range,(2) in order from the North-West.\n\n| Name of Pass | Remarks |\n|--------------|---------|\n| Kag          | Between Danlong N\u00e1l\u00e1 in P\u00e1dar and Bardan Gompa in Zansk\u00e1r; height about 17,500 feet; rough road. |\n| Poat La      | Between Danlong N\u00e1l\u00e1 in P\u00e1dar and Bardan Gompa in Zansk\u00e1r; height about 17,500 feet; rough road, one day on snow. |\n| Kang La      | Between Miy\u00e1r N\u00e1l\u00e1 in Chamba-L\u00e1hul and Bardan Gompa; height about 17,500 feet; road rough, three days on snow, journey takes five days. |\n\nThe Kag Pass and Poat La are just outside State territory, but are crossed by travellers from P\u00e1ngi.\n\n### VII.\u2014Pass in the East L\u00e1hul(3) Range.\n\n| Name of Pass | Remarks |\n|--------------|---------|\n| Th\u00e1raug La   | Between Miy\u00e1r N\u00e1l\u00e1 and D\u00e1rcha in British L\u00e1hul; height 17,188 feet; four marches, road rough, one day on snow. |\n\n### VIII.\u2014Pass in the Gurdh\u00e1r Range.\n\n| Name of Pass | Remarks |\n|--------------|---------|\n| Gurdh\u00e1r      | Between Miy\u00e1r N\u00e1l\u00e1 and Bhotaur in Saichu N\u00e1l\u00e1; height 16,791 feet; road difficult in one place; three marches. |\n\n---\n\n(1) The range running to the south of the Danlong N\u00e1l\u00e1.\n(2) The name \"Zansk\u00e1r Range\" locally applied to the Western Him\u00e1laya is now used by the Trigonometrical Survey for a branch range running to the north of Zansk\u00e1r. Here and in the Description it is used in its local meaning for a section of the Western Him\u00e1laya\u2014the direct continuation of the main Himalayan chain.

Two men to each pony are necessary to render help at difficult parts of the road.\n\nThe postal arrangements are conducted under an Imperial Postal convention, concluded in January 1887 and are entirely under State control, all the officials being appointed by the R\u00e1j\u00e1; but the Superintendent of Post Offices, Ambala Division, has the right of inspection. The Postal Department is in charge of a Post Master-General. Dalhousie is the Imperial office of Exchange. Chamba is the head office in the State with seven branch offices in the wiz\u00e1rats; and a daily arrival and despatch service is maintained, except to Brahmaur and P\u00e1ng\u00ed where climatic conditions make this possible only in summer.\n\nThe postage stamps are those used in the rest of India with the words 'Chamb\u00e1 State' surcharged in black. Letters,\npost-cards, &c., addressed to places outside India must bear ordinary Indian stamps and not the surcharged ones.\n\nService stamps are surcharged 'On State Service' instead of the familiar O. H. M. S. Table No. 31 gives the names of the Post-offices in Chamb\u00e1 and Table No. 32 furnishes full details of the working of Post-offices.\n\nAll letters, parcels, &c., are carried by runners, and along all the principal roads there are chauk\u00eds or stage rest-houses at which the runners are relieved.\n\nTelegraphic communication was opened in 1904 and is under the control of the Imperial Telegraph Department. The only Telegraph office in the State is in Chamb\u00e1 town and is of the 3rd class.\n\nSection H.\u2014Famine.\n\nFamine is unknown in the State, but great scarcity verging on famine sometimes prevails in P\u00e1ng\u00ed, when the winter sets in early and the autumn crops are damaged or destroyed by snow. The last occasion was in 1878-79, when grain had to be imported from Chur\u00e1h.\nCHAPTER III.\u2014ADMINISTRATIVE.\n\nSection A.\u2014General Administration and State Staff.\n\nIn ancient times, as the copper plates of the 10th and 11th centuries show, the administration of the State was modelled on that of India generally, and lists of high-sounding official titles from the R\u00e1j\u00e1 to the executioner are given, and allusions made to 'the highest Brahmans, who held a prominent position among the eighteen elements of the State', down to the 'Medas, Andrakas, fishers and Chand\u00e1las.'\n\nIn later times there used to be five principal officials of the State at the capital:\n\n(1). Waz\u00edr or Chief Minister.\n(2). Thare da Mahtq or Chief Financial Officer.\n(3). Bakhsh\u00ed, who used to keep the military accounts and was responsible for the internal administration of the forces. This title is now borne by the Chief Revenue Officer of the State.\n(4). H\u00e1zre da Kotw\u00e1l, who was in attendance on the R\u00e1j\u00e1 and carried out his orders.\n(5). Thare da Kotw\u00e1l, who performed miscellaneous duties and disposed of petty cases occurring in the town; all other cases were settled by the Chief Minister, while those of a special or serious nature were adjudicated upon in the R\u00e1j\u00e1's Court.\n\nThere were separate Waz\u00edrs in P\u00e1ng\u00ed and Brahmaur, but in the other parganas a Mah\u00eda and a Kotw\u00e1l were appointed. These posts of Mah\u00eda and Kotw\u00e1l were often held by men selected in the town, and they transacted the business of their respective parganas from the capital. These posts were more or less sinecures.\n\nThe State naturally falls into five divisions as regards climate, people and products, and these form the five wiz\u00e1rats:\n\n1. Chamb\u00e1 or Sadr wiz\u00e1rat in the centre, containing the capital.\n2. Chur\u00e1h wiz\u00e1rat to the north and north-west, bordering with Basohl\u00ed and Bhadraw\u00e1h in Jammu State.\n3. P\u00e1ng\u00ed wiz\u00e1rat, which comprises a portion of L\u00e1h\u00fal and is geographically distinct from the rest of the State.\n4. Brahmaur or Gaderan, an old wiz\u00e1rat lying to the south and sout! east of Chamb\u00e1.\n5. Bhattiy\u00e1t wiz\u00e1rat, lying to the south and south-west of the Dhaula Dh\u00e1r and adjoining Kangra and Gurd\u00e1spur.\n\n(1) For a full account of the State officials in ancient times reference may be made to the Antiquities of Chamb\u00e1, Vol. I, pp. 107\u2014123.\nThe Civil and Criminal Courts of Justice are located at the capital where the higher officers of the State reside, and they are presided over by Judges with 1st class magisterial powers appointed by the R\u00e1j\u00e1; and are under his supervision and control. The final Court of Appeal is that presided over by the R\u00e1j\u00e1 himself. Next after the Chief in authority is the Waz\u00edr, who has much the same functions as attached to the office in former times. In the R\u00e1j\u00e1's absence he is invested with full charge of the State. Of the old titles that of Bakhshi is now held by the Chief Revenue Officer, through whom all revenue payments are made, and credited into the treasury. The title of Kotw\u00e1l is now borne by the Superintendent of Police, who has functions analogous to those of the Thare da Kotw\u00e1l of former times. All criminal cases in the capital or from the parganas pass through his hands, and he makes the preliminary investigation and forwards the record to the Sadr Court for disposal.\n\nEach of the five wiz\u00e1rats is under the control of a Waz\u00edr, who, however, is non-resident, and has the title only when on duty in his wiz\u00e1rat. In every wiz\u00e1rat there is a Court with civil and criminal powers, and the presiding officer is vested with the powers of a 2nd class Magistrate, and can also hear and decide civil suits up to Rs. 1,000 in value. These Courts can receive, hear and investigate petitions regarding revenue, and can send up the cases with their opinions to the Sadr Court. P\u00e1ng\u00ed and Brahmaur have Courts only in summer.\n\nThe Vak\u00edl of the State at Dalhousie, having jurisdiction separate from the Bhattiy\u00e1t wiz\u00e1rat, exercises the same powers as the other Waz\u00edrs and holds his Court at Dalhousie under special arrangements with Government. He hears all cases within his jurisdiction, comprising the parganas of B\u00e1thr\u00ed, Sherpur, Nag\u00e1ll, Chun, Hub\u00e1r, &c. Cases which are beyond his powers are instituted in, and decided by, the Courts at Chamb\u00e1. Cases of parganas in Bhattiy\u00e1t, other than those falling under the jurisdiction of the Vak\u00edl at Dalhousie, are decided in the Court of the Bhattiy\u00e1t wiz\u00e1rat.\n\nEach wiz\u00e1rat is subdivided into a certain number of parganas, or small administrative districts. The original designation of each administrative district was mandala, as shown by the copper plate deeds. The present name pargana or il\u00e1qa probably came into use during the period of Mughal ascendancy. It is a popular belief that the State was formerly subdivided into 84 of these mandalas or parganas, and there is good reason for thinking that this belief is well founded.\n\nThe State was considerably larger in former times than it is now, including as it did the provinces of Rihlu and P\u00e1lam to the south of the Dhaua Dh\u00e1r, and Bhadraw\u00e1h and P\u00e1dar in the Chen\u00e1b Valley. Even in 1846-47, when it came under British control there were still 72 parganas in the State (vide Vol. II, Treaties, Engagements and Sanads, pages 370, 371 and 372). The number has\nbeen much reduced since then by the amalgamation of two or more small parganas into one large administrative district, and now stands at 52. There were till recently 12 parganas in the Bhattiyat wisarat (where now there are only 10), hence the name \"Barah Bhattian.\"\n\nEach pargana has a State Kothi which is the headquarters and place of residence of the pargana officials when on duty. These Kothis differ much in size and general appearance, but most of the older ones have been erected according to a design very common in the State. This is a large square, measuring 20 or 30 yards on each side, with an open court-yard in the centre. The building is usually two or three storeys in height, and is divided into rooms and dalans or open verandahs. There is a principal entrance door, and a staircase in the court-yard leading to the upper storeys. Some of these Kothis are very ancient, several of them dating from the time of the Ranas. The more recently erected Kothis are of small size, and consist usually of a few rooms in line, with a verandah in front.\n\nThe work of each pargana is carried on by a Char, a Likhnehra and a Batwal, called collectively Kardars or Kamdars. The jurisdiction of a Char is called Charri. The most ancient officials are probably the Char and the Batwal, and it seems certain that reference is made to them in the old title deeds, under the names chata and bhata. The office of Likhnehra is probably of more recent date. In certain places there is an office-bearer known as Chhota Char with jurisdiction separate from that of the Bara Char.\n\nIn former times the Char was the chief pargana official, and, indeed, he is still generally regarded as such; though the tendency now is to look on the Likhnehra as having precedence, owing to his being responsible for the revenue and the accounts of the pargana. The Char had formerly much larger powers than now, being able to inflict a fine or imprisonment. The larger powers were withdrawn by the European Superintendents, except in the case of the officials at Brahmar who in certain cases are allowed to impose a small fine. At the present time the pargana officials can only apprehend criminals and send them to Chambal for trial. In both civil and criminal cases they make the preliminary investigation. They also carry out all orders from the central authority, and provide coolies for State service as well as for travellers.\n\nThe other pargana office-bearers are subordinate to the Kardars, and their functions, including those of the Kardars, are as follows:\n\n1. Char.\u2014Already described.\n2. Likhnehra.\u2014Keeps the revenue accounts, and does all clerical work.\n3. Batw\u00e1l.\u2014Carries out the orders of the Ch\u00e1r and Likhne-h\u00e1ra, holding under them a position analogous to that of the H\u00e1re da Kotw\u00e1l under the R\u00e1ja in former times.\n\n4. Jhutiy\u00e1r.\u2014A servant under the orders of the Batw\u00e1l. He carries out the orders of the K\u00e1rd\u00e1rs conveyed through his immediate chief, the Batw\u00e1l.\n\n5. Ugr\u00e1hik\u00e1\u2014A peon who collects the revenue demand under the K\u00e1rd\u00e1rs.\n\n6. Jins\u00e1l\u00ed.\u2014Was in charge of the magazine of the pargana, an office now abolished.\n\n7. P\u00e1hri.\u2014The guardian of the State Koth\u00ed, records, and the revenue, both cash and kind.\n\n8. Bh\u00e1nd.\u2014Cooks the K\u00e1rd\u00e1rs' food, and cleanses the utensils.\n\n9. H\u00e1li\u2014Keeps the Koth\u00ed clean and looks after the storage and safe-keeping of the grain.\n\n10. K\u00e1gud\u00e1ru.\u2014Carries letters.\n\n11. Lakarh\u00e1r.\u2014Supplies firewood to the Koth\u00ed.\n\n12. Ghiy\u00e1r\u00fa.\u2014Collects ghi from those who pay ghi as revenue.\n\n13. Dudhy\u00e1r\u00fa.\u2014Collects milk for officials.\n\nGenerally speaking, there is only one Koth\u00ed in each pargana; but in large parganas, which have been made up by the amalgamation of two or three smaller ones, there is more than one Koth\u00ed, and in each of them are separate P\u00e1hris, H\u00e1lis and Jhutiy\u00e1rs.\n\nIn the parganas of the Sadr wiz\u00e1rat, outside the capital, the ordinary office-bearers Nos. 1 to 13 are in charge, excepting Nos. 6, 10, 12 and 13, which are now abolished.\n\nIn the Chur\u00e1h wiz\u00e1rat there used to be an officer, called Odhru, superior to the K\u00e1rd\u00e1rs, in the parganas of Jhund, Bhalai, Koh\u00e1l, Bh\u00e1ndal and Kih\u00e1r. This post, along with Nos. 6, 10, 12 and 13, has now been abolished, but the others are maintained.\n\nIn the P\u00e1ng\u00ed wiz\u00e1rat there used to be an officer, called P\u00e1l\u00e1s\u00e1d below the W\u00e1zir; and subordinate to him were all the office-bearers Nos. 1 to 12 described above. The post of P\u00e1l\u00e1s\u00e1d is now abolished, but the rest exist as elsewhere. In P\u00e1ng\u00ed the Ugr\u00e1hik\u00e1 is called Muqaddam, and he also does the work of a Jhutiy\u00e1r, there being no separate office-bearer of that name.\n\nIn P\u00e1ng\u00ed there are three Ch\u00e1ris, viz., Kil\u00e1r, S\u00e1ch and Darw\u00e1s, each under the management of a Ch\u00e1r with a full staff. In spite of its being thus subdivided the whole of P\u00e1ng\u00ed is regarded as one single pargana.\nIn Lakhul the Ch\u0101r resides at Margraon, and the Likhneh\u0101ra at Tindi, each with a Muqaddam subordinate to him, but the Kothi in this il\u0101qa is at Udaipur. Most of this pargana is included in the j\u0101g\u012br of the R\u0101na of Tiloknath, which is therefore regarded as the headquarters.\n\nIn Brahmaur there used to be an officer under the Wazir called Amin, but this post has been abolished. All the other posts, as in other parganas, have been maintained. The Ugr\u0101hik\u0101s of other parganas, the Muqaddams of P\u0101ngi and the Durbiyals of Brahmaur perform similar duties, as already described. The post of Jhutiy\u0101r is not unknown in Brahmaur proper, but his work is done by the Kotheru. There is also an additional office-bearer, called Ahru, below the Durbiyal. The Kotheru and Ahru are not paid servants of the State, but are allowed certain concessions and privileges in their wiz\u0101rat. In former times there was an office-bearer named Pattu\u0101ri, who had woollen blankets made for the R\u0101ja. The wool supplied for the blankets was realised from the people in lieu of revenue.\n\nIn Bhattiy\u0101t the office-bearers resemble in name and function those of Chamb\u0101 and Church\u0101, with the following exceptions:\n\nThe parganas of Chun, Hub\u0101r and Ch\u016br\u0101 had each an officer called Odhru; and Tund\u012b and Silhunta each an Amin, but these posts have now been abolished. They were superior to the K\u014drd\u0101rs. In Bhattiy\u0101t the Bateval is called Th\u0101reth; the Jhutiy\u0101r, Bateval; the Ugr\u0101hik\u0101, Muqaddam; and the Bh\u0101nd, Jiwar or Jhur.\n\nThe Wazir, Odhru, Amin, Mahta, Kotw\u0101l, Ch\u0101r, Likhneh\u0101ra, and Bateval of the parganas formerly received no salary direct from the State, but were allowed to collect certain other emoluments, called rakm, over the revenue demand. This formed a separate charge of cash and kind on the malguz\u0101r. Each office-bearer, entitled to rakm, was obliged to pay a fixed amount in lieu thereof to the State. This payment went under the name of b\u0101jh. Such men were supplied with food free of charge, by the State.\n\nThe other petty office-bearers rendered service on payment; or in lieu of revenue on rent-free land, called bajoh; or in consideration of not rendering personal labour in the shape of beg\u0101r, etc.\n\nIn some parganas, also, where there was a scarcity of artisans, blacksmiths, potters, etc., such workmen were granted bajoh land and their services taken without further payment in their respective parganas. All these forms of remuneration have now been discontinued, and every man is paid for his services in cash.\n\nThe State revenue, both in cash and kind, is realised in two instalments, and credited into the Treasury. All kinds of grain appropriate to each crop are accepted, but under the head an (an\u0101j) if that occurs in the patla (lease), only barley, millet (kodra) and maize are taken. Gh\u016bl is also collected in two instalments.\nGrain required for State use is brought to the capital and the surplus is sold at the mufassil Kothis.\n\nAn abstract showing the parganas in each wiz\u00e1rat, with the cultivated area and revenue is appended:\n\n| Parganas, areas and revenue | Name of wiz\u00e1rat | Names of parganas in each wiz\u00e1rat | Cultivated area in acres | Revenue collection in rupees |\n|-----------------------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|\n|                             |                 |                                   | Kohli or Irrigated | Utar or Undrilled | Total | Cash | Kind to the value of | Total |\n| Sadr or (1) Chamb\u00e1          | R\u00e1jnagar, Tarlod, Dhund, Kharot, Gudiy\u00e1l, S\u00e1ho, Panjila, Kalandra, S\u00e1mis, Lihl, Piura, Basu, Baskin, Mahla, Bhariyan, Karedh, S\u00e1ch, Udaipur. | 1,581 | 30,466 | 32,067 | 47,449 | 9,304 | 56,804 |\n| Chr\u00e1h                       | Jhund, Bhalai, Manjir Bh\u00e1ndal, Kih\u00e1r, O\u00edur, Hamgiri, Barnota, Bagor, Sai, Ch\u00e1nju, Reira, Tisa, Loh Tikri, Jasnur, Koh\u00e1l. | 386 | 32,235 | 32,624 | 54,224 | 14,120 | 68,344 |\n| P\u00e1ngi*                      | K\u00edlar, S\u00e1ch, Darw\u00e1s, L\u00e1hul. | ... | 3,019 | 3,019 | 5,818 | ... | 5,818 |\n| Brahmasur                   | Brahmaur, Tretha, Chanota, Kothi-Rahnu. | 14 | 11,256 | 11,270 | 17,282 | 44 | 17,326 |\n| Bhattiy\u00e1t                   | B\u00e1thri, Sherpur, Nagalli, Chun, Hub\u00e1r, Chu\u00e1ri, Raipur, Tundi, Sihunta, Bhatti-Tikri. | 6,614 | 23,453 | 30,067 | 53,636 | 16,271 | 69,907 |\n| Total                       | ...             |                                   | 8,505 | 100,452 | 109,047 | 178,400 | 39,793 | 218,193 |\n\n* The total cultivated area in P\u00e1ngi wiz\u00e1rat contains 1,433 acres of land irrigated by kuhls, but on account of the high altitude it does not produce rice, and so it should be considered as unirrigated.\n\nSection B.\u2014Civil and Criminal Justice.\n\nThe R\u00e9j\u00e1 is essentially the fountain-head of justice in the State. He appoints all Magistrates and Munsiffs, he confers and withholds all judicial powers, he determines which officers shall hold jurisdiction in each pargana, and finally there is not an order given in the State which may not be reversed by him, either on appeal or in the exercise of his powers of revision. In all civil and criminal cases he is the last Court of Appeal, all sentences of death, however, passed by the R\u00e9j\u00e1 must be confirmed by the Commissioner of Lahore. This official generally pays an annual visit to the State during which he inspects the Courts, the Jail, the Schools, Hospitals, &c.\n\n(1) The parganas of Tarlod, Dhund and Kharot, in Chr\u00e1h, have, for administrative purposes, been included in the Sadr wiz\u00e1rat.\nThe judicial staff consists of the following Officers:\n\n1. Pandit Mohan Lal is the principal Judicial Officer of the State. He exercises the powers of a 2nd class Munsiff in civil suits and of a 2nd class Magistrate in criminal cases.\n\n2. Bakhshi Prabh Dyal, the Chief Revenue Officer of the State, is also invested with the civil powers of a 2nd class Munsiff and the criminal powers of a 2nd class Magistrate.\n\n3. Lala Manak Chand, the Raja's Agent at Dalhousie, is a Magistrate of the 3rd class, and a Munsiff with power to hear suits not exceeding Rs. 500 in value.\n\n4. Lala Jai Dayal, and\n\n5. Lala Karm Singh. Both these officers are Judges of Small Cause Courts, their powers being limited to suits, the value of which does not exceed Rs. 50. They are also empowered to try petty criminal cases and to inflict imprisonment not exceeding 3 months, and fines not exceeding Rs. 30.\n\nFrom all the Courts, whether Criminal or Civil, the appeal lies to the Raja whose decision is final. The Raja alone has the power to inflict the punishment of whipping.\n\nThe permanent place of sitting for all the Courts is the city of Chamba. In the summer months the Raja sends any or all of the Magistrates and Judges into the other wizarats to do whatever judicial work is required; there is no permanent judicial officer in any of the wizarats, all cases and suits being kept till the arrival of the travelling officials. Tables Nos. 34 and 35, show the working of the various Courts. The Indian Penal Code is in force, as are also the Codes of Criminal and Civil Procedure.\n\nSection C.\u2014Land Revenue.\n\nThis subject may appropriately be introduced by the following extracts from the Kangra Gazetteer, which, though primarily referring to Kangra, are equally applicable to Chamba:\n\n\"Under the Rajas, the theory of property in land was that each Raja was a landlord of the whole of his Raj or principality, not merely in the degree in which everywhere in India the State is, in one sense, the landlord, but in a clearer and stronger degree. The Mughal Emperors, in communications addressed to the Hill Rajas, gave them the title of zamindar, i.e., landholder. Documents are preserved in some of the Rajas' families in which this address is used. The Raja was not, like a feudal king, lord paramount over inferior lords of manors, but rather, as it were, manorial lord of his whole country. Each principality was a single estate, divided for management into a certain number of circuits. The circuits were not themselves estates like the mauzas of the plains; they were mere groupings of holdings under one collector of rents. The waste lands, great or small, were the Raja's waste: the arable lands were made up of the separate holdings of his tenants. The rent due from the holder of each field was payable...\"\ndirect to the R\u00e1j\u00e1, unless he remitted it, as an act of favour to the holder, or assigned it in j\u00e1gir to a third party in lieu of pay, or as a subsistence allowance. So also the grazing fees due from the owner of each herd or flock were payable to the R\u00e1j\u00e1, and these were rarely or never assigned to any j\u00e1gird\u00e1r. The agents who collected these dues, from the waz\u00edr down to the village headmen, were the R\u00e1j\u00e1's servants, appointed and paid directly by himself. Every several interest in land, whether the right to cultivate certain fields, to graze exclusively certain plots of waste, work a water-mill, set a net to catch game or hawks on a mountain, or put a fish-weir in a stream, was held direct of the R\u00e1j\u00e1 as a separate holding or tenancy. The incumbent or tenant at the most called his interest a w\u00e1ris\u00ed or inheritance, not a m\u00e1l\u00edki or lordship.\n\nThe artizans and other non-agriculturists resident in villages held their l\u00e1hi b\u00e1ni, or garden plots, of the R\u00e1j\u00e1, not of their village employers and customers, and paid their cesses and were bound to service to him only. They were not the only class bound to service: the regular landholders were all liable to be pressed into service of some kind, military or menial. The R\u00e1j\u00e1s kept a tight hold upon the wastes: certain portions of forest were kept as rakh, or shooting preserves; and trees, whether in forest or open waste, could not be felled, except with the R\u00e1j\u00e1's permission. No new field could be formed out of the waste without a patta or grant from the R\u00e1j\u00e1. No waz\u00edr or other revenue agent, and no j\u00e1gird\u00e1r could give permission to reclaim waste. Such a power was jealously withheld, as it might have led to the growth of intermediate lordships. I have heard it said that, from a feeling of this kind, waz\u00edrs or k\u00e1rd\u00e1rs were never chosen from the royal clan, and j\u00e1girs were generally given in scattered pieces. Certain rights of common in the waste round about their houses were enjoyed, not only by the regular landholders, but by all the rural inhabitants; but these rights were subject to the R\u00e1j\u00e1's right to reclaim, to which there was no definite limit. In short all rights were supposed to come from the R\u00e1j\u00e1; several rights, such as holdings of land, etc., from his grant; others, such as rights of common, from his sufferance.\n\n\"With regard to cultivated lands, the gist of the description (that given by Mr. Barnes) is, that there were two separate properties in the soil, the first and paramount being the right of the State to a share of the gross produce, and the second the hereditary right of cultivation, and claim to the rest of the produce on the part of the cultivator. This hereditary right to hold and cultivate land was known as a w\u00e1ris\u00ed, i.e., an inheritance. It was contingent on the proper cultivation of the land and the punctual payment of the Government dues. Directly these conditions were neglected, the Government had an undoubted right to transfer the tenure to another; but at first the alienation was only temporary, and the claim to recover within a certain period was universally recognized. The right was not saleable, for the holders never considered their tenure of that absolute and perfect character that they could transfer it finally to another. The land, they argued, belongs to Government; ours is simply the right to cultivate. But, though not saleable, the right could be mortgaged for a time, and when the incumbent had no heirs, he was permitted to select a successor, and transfer his land to him in his life-time.\"\n\n(1) The R\u00e1j\u00e1s took a share of every kind of income:\u2014The best hawk caught in a net, the largest fish caught in a weir, a share of the honey of the beehives, and of the fruit of the best fruit trees; even trees planted by a man in his own field were held to be royal property if of certain valuable kinds.\n\n(2) Called b\u00f3r in Chamba.\n\n(3) Kangra Settlement Report, by Sir J. B. Lyall, paragraph 25.\n\n(4) Kangra Gazetteer, pages 192-3.\nThe above description may be applied nearly word for word to Chamb\u00e1, where almost all the conditions of land tenure described are still in force. The principality as a whole forms one estate of which the R\u00e1j\u00e1 is the landlord, and he is the acknowledged fountain-head of all rights in the soil. The zam\u00ednd\u00e1rs are only his tenants, with no rights in the land except the hereditary right to cultivate, conferred by a patla or title-deed and conditional on the punctual adjustment of all State claims. They are, however, permitted, as an act of grace,\u2014to mortgage, and of late years to sell their rights in their holdings; and are never dispossessed unless their land is required for public purposes. The next step in the sub-division of the principality is its distribution into wiz\u00e1rats. These are for both executive and revenue purposes and their boundaries have been determined chiefly by the physical and especially the orographical features of the country. In the Brahmaur wiz\u00e1rat it is probable that the ancient limits have been preserved since the time when it formed the nucleus of the State. Bhattiy\u00e1t is separated from the other wiz\u00e1rats by the mountain range of the Dhaula Dhar, while Chur\u00e1h practically includes the whole of the Sin\u00fa valley. P\u00e1ngi is geographically isolated from the rest of the State by the P\u00e1ngi Range. The Sadr wiz\u00e1rat is the only sub-division with more or less ill-defined natural boundaries chiefly owing to the fact that, for convenience of administration, three of the parganas of Chur\u00e1h have been attached to this wiz\u00e1rat. Thus it happens, as in Kangra and other parts of the hills, that \"the nature of the country has stamped an impress of permanence upon its sub-divisions, which have survived unchanged from the earliest time and have acquired a deep hold on the feelings and prejudices of the people.\"\n\nEach wiz\u00e1rat is sub-divided into a certain number of parganas, and these too, like the wiz\u00e1rats, have clearly defined boundaries, which in most cases have been fixed according to the natural landmarks of the country. Several of these parganas, anciently called mandalas, are referred to in the copper-plate title-deeds of the 10th and 11th centuries, showing that even at that early period these sub-divisions were fully recognized. In more recent years the number of parganas has been much reduced by the amalgamation of two or more into one administrative district. But in many such cases the parganas have continued to preserve their identity to this extent that they still retain a separate staff of officials for fiscal management.\n\nAgain, each pargana is sub-divided into several small circuits, which bear different names in different parts of the State. In Brahmaur the circuit is called durbiy\u00e1li; in Bhattiy\u00e1t and P\u00e1ngi, muqaddami; and in the Sadr and Chur\u00e1h wiz\u00e1rats it is designated jhuliya\u00e1ri. Each circuit contains a varying number of villages, and\n\n---\n\n(1) In the Revenue Records the State is designated m\u00e1l\u00ed'ala Sirk\u00e1 (proprietor), the zam\u00ednd\u00e1rs, ksh\u00e1thar m\u00e1l\u00edg\u00e1dar (tenant paying revenue); and the j\u00f3sir d\u00e1s and m\u00e1l\u00eddd\u00e1rs, m\u00e1l\u00ed ad\u00e1rs (inferior proprietors).\nthe idea underlying this sub-division seems to have been to demarcate an area of such a size that it could be efficiently supervised by one man with an adequate staff of assistants. In the wiz\u00e1rats of Brahmaur, Bhattiy\u00e1t and P\u00e1ng\u00ed the circuits are arranged for executive as well as revenue purposes, and the same official discharges both functions. He is called Durbiy\u00e1l in Brahmaur and Muqaddam in Bhattiy\u00e1t and P\u00e1ng\u00ed. In the Sadr and Chur\u00e1h wiz\u00e1rats the Jhutiy\u00e1r's duties are purely executive; and for the collection of the revenue another official, called Ugr\u00e1hika, is appointed, whose circuit is called ugr\u00e1hk\u00edy\u00e1i. Of these there are several in each pargana, and each official does not confine his duties to one circuit but may go wherever his help is needed, within the limits of the pargana.\n\nIn former times the revenue was assessed according to the amount of seed and quality of the soil, and was realised in kind and cash, called collectively s\u00e1l b\u00e1chh. The s\u00e1l or grain revenue was generally taken in the kind of grain produced. Cesses were also levied on the other products, such as ghi, honey, wool, salt, etc. Later on the revenue fluctuated considerably from time to time, and for a long period was not assessed on any fixed principle. The system of land tenure being feudal the holding of each man was called a nanwa, i.e., a name in the rent roll; and each nanwa or holding meant one ch\u00e1k\u00e1r or servant to the State, which employed them in three ways:\n\n1. H\u00e1zr\u00ed and Chaukid\u00e1r: who paid b\u00e1chh or revenue in cash, and acted as orderlies to the State officials, or as soldiers. These were respectable men of good families.\n\n2. Kotw\u00e1li servants: who paid s\u00e1l b\u00e1chh or revenue in grain and cash, and were of two kinds:\n   (a) Those who were called upon to serve in war.\n   (b) Those who carried loads for the R\u00e1j\u00e1 and troops on a campaign, or for State officials when they went out of the State. These generally belonged to the Bhattiy\u00e1t.\n\n3. Beg\u00e1rus: who in addition to paying s\u00e1l b\u00e1chh were required to furnish beg\u00e1r or forced labour in the capital.\n\nThese different employ\u00e9s were drawn chiefly from the Sadr, Chur\u00e1h and Bhattiy\u00e1t wiz\u00e1rats; the samind\u00e1rs of Brahmaur and P\u00e1ng\u00ed being employed in their own wiz\u00e1rats. In the rent roll each holding stood in the name of the head of the family who alone was responsible for the revenue and State service and on a holding becoming vacant it was customary for the State to confer it on a man who followed the same occupation as the previous holder, as it was often difficult to obtain the requisite number of men of each calling owing to the frequent wars. The amount of service rendered by each family varied according to the size of the hold-\ning; those owning a l\u00e1hri (three acres) provided one servant (ch\u00e1kar) for six months in the year, and those owning two or more l\u00e1hris, for all the year round.\n\nThe dh\u00e1l b\u00e1chh or distribution of the cash revenue varied every year as it was imposed in a lump sum on each pargana, and distributed locally according to the capacity and position of the zamin-d\u00e1rs; and when too heavily assessed, they used to appeal for a reduction through the K\u00e1rd\u00e1rs and leading men of the villages.\n\nIn 1863-64 the State army was disbanded, only the police force being retained, and the services of most of the employ\u00e9s referred to, being no longer required, were dispensed with. The H\u00e1zvis and Chaukid\u00e1rs were then called upon to pay enhanced b\u00e1chh, or cash revenue, at the rate of Rs. 12 on each l\u00e1hri of kohli land, and Rs. 6 on each l\u00e1hri of utar land. And in addition to paying s\u00e1l b\u00e1chh the Kotw\u00e1li servants and Beg\u00e1rus were required to give a cash equivalent, at the rate of Re. 1 per month, in lieu of the service they used to render; being Rs. 6 a year for those owning one l\u00e1hri, and Rs. 12 for those owning two or more l\u00e1hris. This cess was named ch\u00e1krunda, from ch\u00e1kri (service). It was not imposed on the people of Brahmaur and P\u00e1ng\u00ed as they were generally employed only in their own wiz\u00e1rats and were not required to come to Chamb\u00e1. Only a few from the Trolita pargana of Brahmaur used to be summoned in winter to attend shooting excursions, and in consideration of this a small remission was made in the amount of their assessments.\n\nThe posts of Kotw\u00e1l and Mahta of the parganas were at the same time abolished and a system of cash salaries to the ordinary K\u00e1rd\u00e1rs was introduced, instead of the allowances in grain and cash, called rakm, formerly leviable on every holding. The cesses then became an asset of the State and are collected as such with the revenue.\n\nIn the hills wheeled conveyance is not available owing to the absence of suitable roads, and ponies, mules and bullocks are utilized, wherever this is possible. In many parts of the State, however, animal transport even for ordinary purposes, such as traveller\u2019s baggage, is not practicable, and there human labour is the only alternative. As a result, a custom has been in force from ancient time that all who cultivate the soil are under obligation to give up a portion of their labour for the exigencies of the State. This custom formerly prevailed all through the hills and is thus referred to in the K\u00e1ngra Settlement Report:\n\n\u201cUnder former dynasties the people were regularly drafted and sent to work out their period of servitude wherever the Government might please to appoint. So inveterate had the practice become that even artizans and other classes unconnected with the soil were obliged to devote a portion of their time to the public service. The people, by long pro-crip-tion, have come to regard this obligation as one of the normal conditions of existence; and so long as it is kept within legitimate bounds they are content to render this duty with cheerfulness and promptitude. Certain\nclasses...were always exempt, and the burden fell principally on the strictly agricultural tribes. Even among these races there are gradations of beg\u00e1r well recognized, which, for the convenience of the people it was necessary to define. The meanest and most onerous species of forced labour was to carry loads pand beg\u00e1r.(1) A lighter description of beg\u00e1r was termed satb\u00f3hak, and consisted in carrying messages or letters, or any parcel which could be conveyed by the hand. The fulfilment of this duty implied no degradation and involved no great sacrifice of personal comfort. A third species of beg\u00e1r was to provide wood and grass for camp, and under former Governments this labour devolved upon Cham\u00e1rs and other outcast tribes, whose supposed impurity alone saved them from carrying loads.\"\n\nOn the final abolition of the beg\u00e1r system, in 1871-2, as it formerly existed in the State, it became necessary to provide for State service in the capital and the parganas. For the capital this was done by a certain number of men being requisitioned in fixed rotation for one month at a time, from the parganas of the Sadr and Chur\u00e1h wiz\u00e1rats: the present number is about 20 and their service is paid for in cash at the rate of Rs. 6 per coolie per mensem. If more men are required, as for transport, etc., they are specially summoned by the officials. In the parganas all cultivators, not exempted, are liable for State service on special occasions without payment, in addition to the revenue dues; and also for the transport of baggage belonging to State officials and travellers, for which they receive remuneration at fixed rates. They are summoned by the paryana officials in fixed rotation, and if for transport they are not liable for more than one stage, unless where no change of coolies is possible, as on a snowy pass. A man's caste makes no difference: the beg\u00e1r is regarded as a burden on the land to be borne in turn by each landholder not specially exempted. The distribution of the beg\u00e1r is in the hands of the State officials in the capital and the parganas, and the demand for transport is heaviest on the cultivators along the main lines of road.\n\nThe special forms of unpaid beg\u00e1r are five in number, called panj hagg, and are as follows:\u2014(1) If the R\u00faja is on tour in the State those of the cultivators who are called upon must be in attendance for any work that is necessary, whether ordinary service or shik\u00e1r. Those who carry loads on such occasions are remunerated at the rates fixed for travellers, but all other forms of service are unpaid. (2) This rule also applies in the case of the heads of the Administration in British India travelling on duty in the State. (3) The cultivators are also liable for service on the occasion of a marriage or death in the royal family; (4) for the repair or rebuilding of the palace; (5) and also for the repair of roads and bridges within their wiz\u00e1rat. All new roads and bridges, however, are constructed mainly at the cost of the State. As no ch\u00e1khrunda cess is paid in Brahmaur and P\u00e1ngi the cultivators in these wiz\u00e1rats are liable for the various forms of State service.\n\n(1) Called b\u00edch b\u00e9pdr in Chamba.\nwithin their wizarat, without payment, but they are not summoned to the capital. The people of Bhatiy\u00e1t are also exempt from service at the capital.\n\nThe classes who are exempt from beg\u00e1r are chiefly the following: (1) All State officials in the parganas: the subordinate staff such as Jhuliydars, etc., are exempt while in office but again become liable on demitting State service. (2) All persons holding the rank of Akkar: these may be employed in carrying letters or for any other similar light service, but are exempt from bearing loads. (3) Respectable men of lower grade than the Akkars: these may on special occasions be called upon to collect coolies or bring firewood, milk, etc., for the R\u00e1ja's camp, but are not liable for loads. (4) The zamindars in jagirs and s\u00e1san grants attached to temples: these render service to their own superiors and to the State in their own pargana; but are exempt from State beg\u00e1r at the capital. (5) Special cases in which exemption from beg\u00e1r has been granted by an order of the R\u00e1ja, but such cases are not numerous.\n\nIn 1874 Colonel Blair Reid commenced measurements of the cultivated area according to each man's actual possession, and the area and revenue were regularly entered in the register in the name of each holder, and not in that of the head of the family as was the previous custom. The old system of levying grain as revenue was also partly replaced by one of cash payments. Later on the revenue rates were modified by fixing Rs. 4 per acre on kohli land, and Rs. 2 per acre on utar land. The unemployed people in the State were then encouraged to reclaim waste lands, the demand for grain in Dalhousie and Bakloh having greatly increased.\n\nThe separate assessment of each holding has greatly facilitated the collection of the revenue, as the larger holdings were sub-divided, and the entries made in the rent-roll in the names of the individual holders, making all directly responsible for the payment of revenue. The sal, or revenue in grain, remained the same as before the sub-division, but, in order to ensure prompt adjustment of the demand, the following procedure was adopted. When grain was collected and threshed and its sale had begun, the State notified a rate in every pargana, higher than the local rate prevailing at the time. This rate was fixed for that portion of the sal required for the R\u00e1ja's use in Chamb\u00e1, and its effect was to restrain the zamindars from disposing of their grain to the dealers until the State demand had been met. When a sufficient portion of the sal had been secured the State notified a lower rate, enabling the zamindars to sell their surplus grain at a profit and satisfy the balance of the sal demand in cash. This system is still in force, and the grain revenue on each khata has thus been much reduced. The income of the State is always affected by the fluctuating rates of grain. The State is entitled to raise or lower the revenue rates.\n\n(1) By ancient custom the zamindars are liable to be summoned, for the five special kind of beg\u00e1r, if necessary from all parts of the State.\nIn Brahmour revenue was formerly realised in several ways. A money cess, called *bachh dasrit* (dasrit-country-custom), was imposed on all Gaddis, whether settled in the State for many generations or immigrants from Kangra and Jammu. In addition to this, wheat and various other articles, such as wool, yarn and even woollen cloth were also levied from the cultivators. The *bachh dasrit* cess was paid by every person who held land in the Brahmour *wizarat*, whether resident or non-resident. Other dues were paid by those who cultivated land in the absence of the owner. If an absentee landholder continued to pay the *bachh dasrit* he was entitled, despite his absence, to recover his hereditary share of the land from his tenants on his return, including the crop on the ground. When revenue rates were fixed in 1891, the *bachh dasrit* cess was transferred from the names of those not in possession (*i.e.*, *ghair-kabis*), and a cash revenue in proportion to the area was imposed on those in actual possession. No revenue in kind is taken in Brahmour.\n\nFormerly all Gaddis who used to pay the *bachh dasrit* cess enjoyed certain privileges, in that persons of other tribes were prohibited from marrying a Gaddi woman or keeping a Gaddi widow. In such cases women of loose character were tried by the *Drubiyal*, who exacted a penalty according to custom. But this custom is now obsolete, and the Gaddis are governed by the ordinary law.\n\nThe greater portion of Lakhul in Pangi *wizarat* is assigned in *jagir* to the Kan\u00e2 of Triloknath, who realizes the revenue and pays the amount fixed as *bachh*. A peculiar custom of levying land revenue is in force in Lakhul. This custom is called *pher\u00e2*, and its origin is that the *Wasir* of Pangi used to visit Lakhul every third year, when grain and cash were paid to him as of right over and above the land revenue. The ordinary State dues were raised every year by the *Kardars*, but the extra cesses were only realized every third year on the arrival of the *Wasir*. This custom still exists but under the present management of the State, the salaries of the State servants are fixed, and all the cesses formerly received by officials are now considered to belong to the State as of right, and the revenue in Pangi and Lakhul is now paid in cash instead of in grain, etc.\n\nA yearly Darbar, called *Bhriri Jalsa*, has been held by the Rajas from ancient time in the month of Asuj. On this occasion the heir-apparent and members of the ruling family, State officials, men of good families and *Harris* and *Chaukidars*, who were exempt from *begar*\u2014all in their proper order of precedence\u2014enjoyed the privilege of presenting a *naarana* to the Ruling Chief. The amount, called *rular bhriri*, was fixed for each and varied according to the status of the person presenting it. In addition to these every member of the general community who cared to do so, could present a *naar* in\n\n---\n\n(1) *Bhriri* is probably from *bhrind*, meaning \"in a line\", as in arranging presents.\nkind according to his occupation or calling. The gardener brought a basket of fruit and flowers; the carpenter a sample of his skill in carpentry; the goldsmith a silver or gold ornament; the wood-carver a bowl or cup; the oilman a pot of oil, and so on.\n\nOn the accession of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Sh\u00e1m Singh in 1873 the privilege of presenting Re. 1 as a nazr on this occasion was extended to all respectable men in the State. These are called Akkars, and correspond very much to the H\u00e1z\u00eds and Chaukid\u00e1rs of former times. They are all exempted from beg\u00e1r. The sum realised at the Bh\u00edr\u00ed Jalsa is credited into the Treasury.\n\nThe collection of revenue, as already stated, is carried out by the Durbiy\u00e1ls, Muqaddams, or Ugr\u00e1hik\u00e1s of the different parganas, with a staff of assistants and under the orders of the K\u00e1rd\u00e1rs of each pargana. To them is assigned the duty of collecting the b\u00e1chh or cash revenue only, and when realised it is paid over to the Likhneh\u00e1ra in each pargana, who credits it into the Treasury at Chamb\u00e1. The s\u00e1l or revenue in kind is differently dealt with in different wiz\u00e1rats. In Brahmaur and P\u00e1ng\u00ed no s\u00e1l is received, the whole revenue demand being payable in cash: in Bhattiy\u00e1t the s\u00e1l is delivered at the Kothis, where it is retained: in the Sadr and Chur\u00e1h wiz\u00e1rats one portion is retained at the Kothis and the other sent into Chamb\u00e1: the proportion varying according to the requirements of the State. When cash is accepted in lieu of grain revenue it is paid over to the Likhneh\u00e1ra of the pargana.(1) The revenue is collected twice a year, called bahria and sairia, and all the accounts are submitted at the end of each financial year, by the Likhneh\u00e1ras of the parganas to the Bakhshi or Chief Revenue Officer of the State. For these, as well as the revenue demand the Likhneh\u00e1ra in each pargana is responsible, but he has the assistance of the Char in all the details of his work.\n\nAs already stated, the highest form of property recognized in the State is the hereditary right to cultivate. This right is conferred by a patia or title-deed from the R\u00e1j\u00e1 which in every case clearly specifies the fields or plots of ground for which the deed is granted, as well as their name, area and rental. Beyond this the grantee acquires no ownership in the land, which in all circumstances continues to be the property of the State. Waste lands are never included in such grants, but by custom the cultivator enjoys the rights of user (bartan) in the wastes near his holding. These rights are chiefly as follows:\u2014the right to pasture sheep and goats and also cattle; to cut grass (gh\u00e1li) and the leaves of certain trees for fodder and thorns for hedges; to gather or break dry wood for fuel; to cut pine or cedar splinters for torches (jagni) from dry and fallen trees within the bartan; to fell small trees of inferior quality, called bans\u00e1ti, for fuel at marriages and funerals. Other rights are also enjoyed, such as\n\n(1) In addition to the ordinary grain revenue the State also takes the following products from the samind\u00e1rs\u2014ghi, sarson oil, ginger, apricot seeds, kach\u00e1lu and til. Honey and other products used to be taken, but an equivalent is now given in cash.\nthe grant of timber for building purposes, but for this a written permit must be obtained from the central authority at Chamb\u00e1. These privileges are not confined to the actual cultivators, but are also enjoyed by the farm servants and others resident in the village, who do not own land but keep a few sheep and goats. In the case of the forests also the rights of user have all been clearly recorded, but the State reserves the right to modify or annul these privileges at any time if it is considered advisable to do so. The cultivators may not cut trees, the timber of which is valuable, even when they grow within the limits of their arable land.\n\nAs all the land in the State is the property of the R\u00e1j\u00e1, the cultivators being only his tenants, no new land can be broken up without his permission given through a patta or title-deed; and such land is liable to revenue in the same way as the older holdings. On the other hand, if the person who reclaims the land comes from another pargana he at once becomes entitled to the same bartan or rights of user as the other residents in the locality. When any area is surrendered by a cultivator or washed away by a stream it ceases to be entered in its holder's name, and he is then relieved of all burdens in connection with it.\n\nThe rights of user enjoyed by the cultivators in waste land are, in most cases, general, that is, grazing, cutting of fuel, etc., are allowed to all in any part of the waste near their holdings, subject only to considerations of mutual convenience. In the case of gh\u00e1li or hay fields this is not so. Here each farmer usually has a special plot, near his holding or at some distance away, which by common consent is recognized as, in a sense, private. If necessary this plot is enclosed for some months in the year to protect it from cattle, and in it the grass grows long and thick. In October or later this is cut for the supply of hay in winter and then the fence is removed, till the following summer, and there is no distinction between the hay field and the common waste. Though permanently attached to the holding the farmers are not considered owners of their gh\u00e1li lands in the same way or degree as of their cultivated fields; for no patta is granted for them and no rent is paid to the State.\n\nBy ancient custom the State claims the title to all natural streams and rivers, subject to rights of user held by cultivators for irrigation purposes; owners of gr\u00e1ts or water-mills; and those entitled to erect chips or fish-weirs. A tax on gr\u00e1ts, called gr\u00e1tid\u00e1na, also on chips and fishing with the net or hook is payable to the State.\n\nNo Regular Settlement of the State has ever been carried out. The tenants in the State may be arranged in the following classes:\n\n(1). The k\u00e1shtk\u00e1r m\u00e1lguz\u00e1r or crown tenants, comprising the great bulk of the cultivators in the State. They pay their revenue demand direct through the K\u00e1rd\u00e1rs of the parganas and in addition\nare liable for certain kinds of State service which are fully detailed under beg\u0101r (vide pp. 271-3).\n\n(2). The jhumri\u0101lu.\u2014These are of three kinds. The highest class sub-rent land from the crown tenants and reside on it, cultivating with their own agricultural implements. They give half the produce to the zamind\u0101r, after all demands for farm service have been satisfied and the seed has been put aside for the next sowing. They are also under obligation to give service in cutting wood and grass; and at marriages and funerals as well as on other special occasions in the zamind\u0101r's family.\n\n(3). The jhumri\u0101lu aw\u0101s\u012bd\u0101r.\u2014This class hold land in lieu of service, and therefore retain the whole of the produce. They are at liberty to cut leaves for fodder and graze their cattle within their own land.\n\n(4). The third class of jhumri\u0101lu are farm servants. A portion of land is assigned to each for his support in lieu of cash payment; which is cultivated along with his master's land and the produce made over to him at each harvest. He also receives food and clothing.\n\n(5). The gh\u0101ra, who may or may not reside on the zamind\u0101r's land, which he cultivates. He gives half the produce after the seed for the next sowing has been put aside, and is liable for service at special times according to agreement.\n\n(6). The mudiy\u0101ri. This class give a fixed quantity of grain as rent after each harvest, and they are only liable for such service as is specified in their agreement.\n\n(7). The tikid\u0101r pays cash rental, and gives service according to the terms of his contract.\n\nIn P\u0101ngi and L\u0101hul the only form of tenancy is called adhi-gh\u0101ri, that is, an equal division of the crop between landlord and tenant, but even this form is not common as the zamind\u0101rs usually work their own lands.\n\nThe State contains rich and extensive pasture lands, some near the villages and others on the high mountain ranges, especially on the slopes of the Dhaula Dh\u0101r and the P\u0101ngi Range. The pastures near the villages are called juh, munchar and gorch\u0101r; those at a greater distance, but from which the animals can be brought home at night, are named trakar; while the high mountain pastures, only accessible to sheep and goats in summer, are spoken of as dh\u0101r, g\u0101har and nigdh\u0101r.(ii) The name dh\u0101r is most common in the B\u012bs and R\u0101vi Valleys, while g\u0101har and nigdh\u0101r are found in P\u0101ngi.\n\nThe high fields, above the villages and near the trakar pastures, to which the sheep and goats are taken for grazing in summer, are called adw\u0101ri or dudh\u0101ri in Chur\u0101h; kat and katohar in Brahmaur;\n\n(ii) The name nigdh\u0101r is from n\u012bra, \"a kind of grass\" and g\u0101har \"pasture land.\"\nand puhali in P\u00e1ng\u00ed. The pastures near the villages are grazed by the village cattle as well as the sheep and goats; and the trakar pastures by sheep and goats only. The dh\u00e1r, g\u00e1har and nig\u00e1har pastures are visited only by shepherds who spend several months every summer in these rich uplands.\n\nThe people of the Sadr, Bhattiy\u00e1t and Chur\u00e1h wiz\u00e1ruts excel in the rearing of cattle, while the Gaddis of Brahmaur, who are a pastoral people, own large flocks of sheep and goats, which constitute their chief wealth.\n\nIn P\u00e1ng\u00ed and L\u00e1hul, on the other hand, owing to the scarcity of fodder, a zam\u00edn\u00e9d\u00e1r cannot afford to keep more than 20 or 25 cattle and 100 sheep and goats.\n\nFor all the pastures grazing dues, called trini, are levied by the State. In former times the trini dues for grazing used to be collected in kind, i.e., in wool and sheep or goats; a small amount only being taken in cash: and the graziers paid these dues direct to the State.\n\nIn 1863-4 the system was adopted of selling the trini by auction, and when roads were opened many Gujars from all parts flocked to the pastures, thus enhancing the value of the contract. The same trini rate prevails for all the different pasturages, viz., 2 chakkis(1) per head, or Rs. 2-8-0 per 100 head of sheep and goats; being the maximum rate which the contractor is entitled to demand from the graziers. The amount payable to the State depends on the terms agreed upon at the time of auction.\n\nThe contract is now sold yearly in April for each pargana of the Sadr, Chur\u00e1h, Bhattiy\u00e1t and Brahmaur wiz\u00e1ruts.\n\nIn P\u00e1ng\u00ed wiz\u00e1rat the procedure is somewhat different. The Chandrabh\u00e1ga river divides P\u00e1ng\u00ed into two tracts\u2014one on the left bank, in which are situated only a few villages, the other on the right bank, comprising most of the populated area, with its pasturages. The whole of the pastures of the latter tract, as well as the special pastures held by the few zam\u00edn\u00e9d\u00e1rs in the former tract, are reserved for the use of the people of P\u00e1ng\u00ed, who are also exempt from the payment of trini dues for their own pastures. All other pastures on the left bank are sold by auction, and flocks from Chur\u00e1h and other parts are allowed to graze in them.\n\nIn L\u00e1hul, most of which is held in j\u00e1gir by the R\u00e1n\u00e1 of Trilokn\u00e1th, both the State and the J\u00e1g\u00edrd\u00e1r have their own g\u00e1hars.\u2014Those of the State are called s\u00e1lpan, and were probably taken over from the J\u00e1g\u00edrd\u00e1r in former times as grazing ground for the private flocks of the R\u00e1j\u00e1. As no flocks are now owned by the State the s\u00e1lpan g\u00e1hars are sold by auction, and in addition to the trini dues payable to the State the J\u00e1g\u00edrd\u00e1r enjoys the privilege of receiving a sum of money called kar from those who graze their flocks in them.\n\n(1) 5 chakkis = 1 anna.\nThe dh\u00e1rs of the Sadr, Chur\u00e1h, Bhattiy\u00e1t and Brahmanr wiz\u00e1rats are occupied by Gujars who pay trini at the rate of Re. 1-8-0 for a milch buffalo, 12 annas if not in milk and the same for a calf, being the maximum rates chargeable by the contractor. The Gujars come up in April and retire in October, but some of them have settled in the hills like the ordinary zam\u00ednd\u00e1rs. Their settlements have greatly increased the amount of trini collected, and the trade in ghi.\n\nThe State also auctions, along with its own pastures, the trini of Lodu\u00e1n, Poarha, Kal\u00e1kh, Mua, Dehra, Pirhain, Lakhanpur and Behaur, etc., in British and Jammu territory. This right seems to have been enjoyed for a long period, but there is no record as to how and when it was acquired. The tax, called mal\u00e1na and utkar, is realised by the contractor and the rate varies in different localities. In the forests of Ladu\u00e1n, etc., the utkar and mal\u00e1na are realised in the following manner:\u2014In December the contractor arranges with a number of m\u00e1lundis (shepherds) who, in return for grazing rights, pen their flocks for 60 nights on the fields of any zam\u00ednd\u00e1rs he may name, for the sake of the manure. This is called got, for which the zam\u00ednd\u00e1r pays to the contractor a fee called mal\u00e1na and provides one of the m\u00e1lundis in turn with food. After the shepherd has fulfilled the contractor\u2019s requirements he is at liberty to manure the fields of any one who may pay him for doing so. No one is allowed to herd his flocks in the jungles before the got begins, and in such cases the offender has to compensate the contractor for his loss.\n\nThe utkar tax is levied from the owners of the flocks at the rate of Re. 1 for every 100 head of sheep or goats.\n\nThe animals which are kept at home all the year round, that is, are grazed in the near pastures and not taken to the dh\u00e1rs and g\u00e1hars in summer or the low hills in winter are called ghareri, and the grazing dues for these are named trini-ghareri.\n\nThe flocks of sheep and goats, other than ghareri, are constantly migrating between the low hills and the inner mountains. In the beginning of the cold weather\u2014October and November\u2014they are driven to the low hills of K\u00e1ngra, N\u00farpur and Path\u00e1nkot, from which they are brought back in April to their villages to manure the fields, and in June they are all entrusted to a m\u00e1lundi(1) or shepherd, for the summer months. After a month in the trakar pastures some are led up to the dh\u00e1rs of Chur\u00e1h, Brahmaur and other parts; and others are taken over the passes of the P\u00e1ng\u00ed Range to the g\u00e1hars of P\u00e1ng\u00ed and L\u00e1hul, where they remain during July and August. In the beginning of September the flocks commence the return journey over the P\u00e1ng\u00ed Range, and\n\n(1) The m\u00e1lundi is a man who possesses a large number of sheep and goats, and also grazes those of others at a fixed rate of remuneration. Each of the latter is called gana and he pays the m\u00e1lundi one mani (nearly 2 seers patta of grain) per head for the season in addition to salt and tax.\nare brought back to the *trakar* pastures. In October they are taken to the villages to manure the fields, whose owners have to provide food for the shepherds and their dogs, as well as fuel at night. In some parts the *s\u0101m\u012bnd\u0101rs* pay money, in addition, to the owners of the flocks. After October the flocks are again led to the jungles of Bhattiy\u0101t, N\u016brpur and Path\u0101nkot, where they remain till March.\n\nIf a man wishes to have his flock grazed with the flock of someone else he must provide a *puh\u0101l* (shepherd) of his own for every hundred head of sheep and goats: or else pay a fee of about Rs. 15, besides the grazing tax, and salt for the use of the flock, for the cold weather only. The *puh\u0101l* is not remunerated in cash but is provided with food, wool, etc., in return for his services. A man who has only a few sheep and goats generally makes a private arrangement with a *mal\u016bndi* to graze them.\n\nIn P\u0101ngi the cattle and flocks are driven early in June up to the *puh\u0101lis* on the mountain slopes, and while there the fields are manured. In July they are taken up to the *g\u0101hars*, where they remain till October, after which they are again brought back to the *puh\u0101lis*. In October all return to the villages for the winter; and are penned in one end of the living rooms, and fed on the grass cut and stored during the leisure months.\n\nIn L\u0101hul the animals are kept at home and grazed on the pastures near the villages.\n\nThe *J\u0101gird\u0101rs* in the State represent old families who in most cases have held their lands for several hundred years, and, in the case of the R\u0101n\u0101s, for a very much longer period. A full account of each family will be found under Principal Families and R\u0101n\u0101s; several of them are branches of the ruling family. In accordance with ancient custom, and the terms of their title-deeds the *J\u0101gird\u0101rs* are under obligation to serve the State, as horsemen in the R\u0101j\u0101's Body-guard, providing their own horses, and to accompany the Chief with their retainers on military expeditions: but in recent years the privilege has been granted of substituting a cash cess, called *ghori\u0101na*, for this obligation. Some *J\u0101gird\u0101rs* are allowed special privileges.\n\nAll the *J\u0101gird\u0101rs* are liable for the *b\u0101chh*, or revenue in cash, and according to an old usage *ghar\u016b b\u0101chh* is also realised from the *J\u0101gird\u0101rs* in addition to the *b\u0101chh* cess. *Ghar\u016b b\u0101chh* means simply cash paid from the *J\u0101gird\u0101r*'s purse, that is, from his own private income, as distinct from *b\u0101chh*, which is a fixed portion of the cash revenue drawn from his tenants. All *beg\u0101r\u016bs* in the service of *J\u0101gird\u0101rs* (*i.e.*, those who hold land on the tenure of liability to give service) are liable to pay *ch\u0101krunda* (*i.e.*, a cash payment by a *beg\u0101r\u016b* in lieu of the service formerly rendered to the State or a *J\u0101gird\u0101r*, in the town or at the *J\u0101gird\u0101r*'s house) except those of\na Jagirdar to whom a certain number of begaris is allowed free by the State, according to the extent of his jagir.\n\nNo Jagirdar can eject a cultivator, as long as he pays his revenue in full, and renders due service to his landlord, nor can the Jagirdar reclaim waste or realise revenue on it.\n\nThe following are the Jagirs in the parganas of the Sadr Wizdrot:\n\n1. Kharot, held by Mi\u00e1n Budhi Singh, B\u00e1gaw\u00e1la.\n2. Kuh\u00e1l . . . Pandit Mohan L\u00e1l, R\u00e1j\u00e1-gurn.\n3. Gudi\u00e1l . . . Mi\u00e1n Antrindh Singh, Bijlw\u00e1n.\n4.

Jotsh\u00ed Chandermani.\n8. Dhund . . . Kh\u00e1kwa R\u00e1m D\u00e1s, Baratru.\n\nEach of these jagirs comprises a certain number of assigned villages, except Kharot where the whole pargana is held in jagir.\n\nThe Jagirs in Chur\u00e1h are\u2014\n\n1. Bagor, held by Mi\u00e1n Moti Singh, Bijlw\u00e1n.\n2. Bagai . . . Mi\u00e1n Jodh Singh, Behandral.\n\nThe Jagirs in P\u00e1ng\u00ed Wizdrot are\u2014\n\n1. L\u00e1bul, held by R\u00e1n\u00e1 L\u00e1l Chand.\n2. Do . . . R\u00e1n\u00e1 Amin Chand.\n\nIn each case the jagir includes the whole pargana.\n\nThe Jagirs in Brahmanur are\u2014\n\n1. Ul\u00e1nsa, held by R\u00e1n\u00e1 Juddhbir Singh.\n2. Suai . . . R\u00e1n\u00e1 Suchet Singh.\n3. Gurola . . . R\u00e1n\u00e1 Sahib Singh.\n\nThe Jagirs in Bhattiy\u00e1t are\u2014\n\n1. Ch\u00far\u00e1i and R\u00e1ipur, assigned villages, held by Mi\u00e1n Part\u00e1p Singh, Chambial.\n\nRent-free land.\u2014In former times it was customary for the R\u00e1j\u00e1s to confer grants of rent-free land on Brahmans and temples. The five oldest copperplate deeds extant, dating from the 10th and 11th centuries, record such grants, and in the case of one of them\u2014that of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Vidaghda Varma A.D. 960-80\u2014the descend-\n\n---\n\n(1) Mi\u00e1n Moti Singh, Bijlw\u00e1n, died in 1906, but the succession to his jagir is still unsettled and his name is therefore retained.\n\n(2) R\u00e1n\u00e1 L\u00e1l Chand holds almost the whole of L\u00e1bul in jagir, vide p. 177. R\u00e1n\u00e1 Amin Chand has a small jagir in the village of Margraon.\n\n(3) Vide p. 177.\nants of the original grantee, living in the village of Sungal, are still in possession of the land conferred on their ancestor. This form of grant is called s\u00e1san and the holder of it, s\u00e1sani or s\u00e1sand\u00e1r. Most of the rent-free grants in the State are of this nature, while others, called mu\u00e1fi, are held by men of lower caste. The term mu\u00e1fi, however, is now applied to all rent-free grants of land, but the name s\u00e1san is properly used only for grants to Brahmans and temples. The holder of a mu\u00e1fi grant is called mu\u00e1fid\u00e1r.\n\nThe temple of Th\u00e1kur Lakshm\u00ed N\u00e1r\u00e1yan enjoys a large area of rent-free land. Other temples and Brahmans also hold lands in mu\u00e1fi.\n\nThe mu\u00e1f\u00eds assigned to temples are either\u2014\n\n(1) purchased by the temple from other mu\u00e1fid\u00e1r, or\n(2) granted by the State, or\n(3) granted by the persons who purchased the land from other mu\u00e1fid\u00e1rs and dedicated it to the temple,\n\nThe Superintendents of the State put a stop to further sales and mortagages of mu\u00e1f\u00eds.\n\nMost of the mu\u00e1f\u00eds are in the Bhattiy\u00e1t and Sadr Wiz\u00e1rats, owing to the large number of temples and Brahmans in the capital. Mu\u00e1f\u00eds attached to temples are exempt from taxation, but those held by Brahmans are liable to all the b\u00e1chh or cash cesses. In some parts a grain cess, called mangni, is paid. All the mu\u00e1fid\u00e1rs in the capital are also exempt from the b\u00e1chh cess, but, with a few exceptions, those who live in the villages are subject to both mangni and b\u00e1chh.\n\nAbstract of j\u00e1g\u00edrs and mu\u00e1f\u00eds in Chamb\u00e1 State in acres:\n\n| Name of Wiz\u00e1rat | J\u00e1g\u00edr | Mu\u00e1fi |\n|-----------------|-------|-------|\n|                 | Kuhli | Utar. | Total | Kuhli | Utar. | Total |\n| Chamb\u00e1          | 28    | 1,850 | 1,878 | 440   | 4,443 | 4,883 |\n| Chur\u00e1h          | 9\u00bd    | 1,157\u00bd | 1,167 | 22    | 964   | 986   |\n| P\u00e1ngi           |       | 791\u00bd | 791\u00bd |       | 169   | 169   |\n| Brahmaur        |       | 1,008 | 1,008 | 1     | 158\u00bd | 159\u00bd |\n| Bhattiy\u00e1t       | 47\u00bd   | 53\u00bd   | 101   | 855   | 1,239\u00bd | 2,088\u00bd |\n| Total           | 85    | 4,800\u00bd | 4,945\u00bd | 1,318 | 6,908 | 8,226 |\n\n(1) The village of Sungal, ancient Sumangala, is said to have possessed the right of sanctuary down to the reign of R\u00e9j\u00e1 Charat Singh. A. D. 1808\u201444.\nSection D.\u2014Miscellaneous Revenue.\n\n1. There is no distinction between Judicial and Non-Judicial stamps.\n\n2. The values of the stamps are as follows:\n\n| Stamps | Talabanas |\n|--------|-----------|\n| Rs. a. p. | Rs. a. p. |\n| 0 4 0   | 0 4 0     |\n| 0 8 0   | 0 8 0     |\n| 1 0 0   | 1 0 0     |\n| 2 0 0   | 2 8 0     |\n| 4 0 0   | 5 0 0     |\n| 8 0 0   | 12 0 0    |\n| 16 0 0  | 24 0 0    |\n| 32 0 0  |           |\n| 50 0 0  |           |\n\nHalf-sheet foolscap paper is used for stamps, and one-eighth of a sheet of the same kind of paper is used for talabanas.\n\nThe supply for the year is estimated and papers are stamped and valued. The value is stamped in English and Tikri figures. All such stamps and talabanas are made over to the Treasurer. There is but one stamp-vendor in the Sadr Wizarat who sells both stamps and talabanas. In the Wizarats of Pangi and Brahmaur, and in the Vikalat of Dalhousie, they are sold by the Court muharris. There are no stamp-vendors in any other place, because the stamps are used only as court-fees in civil suits and for other proceedings of the Court, as also for registration and wasiqas; they are not used for bonds and other deeds. Hence stamps are required only in places where there are Courts.\n\nStamps are not required, nor are stamp-vendors appointed where there are no Courts.\n\n3. The Stamp and Court-fees Acts are not in force.\n\nThe following is the scale of Court-fees in the Civil Courts:\n\n| For suits not exceeding 16 | Rs. a. p. |\n|---------------------------|-----------|\n| \" exceeding 16 but not exceeding\" | 32 2 0 0 |\n| \" 32 \" | 64 4 0 0 |\n| \" 64 \" | 150 8 0 0 |\n| \" 150 \" | 300 16 0 0 |\n| \" 300 \" | 800 32 0 0 |\n| \" 800 \" | 1,600 50 0 0 |\n| \" 1,600 \" | 3,000 100 0 0 |\n| \" 3,000 \" | 5,000 275 0 0 |\n| \" 5,000 \" | 10,000 400 0 0 |\nSince the establishment of the Courts and the introduction of court-fees the following rates have been in force, and no other charge has ever been made:\n\nFor Criminal cases ... ... Stamp As. 8.\nFor Registration and Wasiga ... \" As. 8.\nFor an appeal against the decision of a Civil Court ... The Court-fee.\nFor an appeal against the decision of a Criminal Court ... Stamp As. 8.\n\n1. Country spirit is made from treacle and molasses in stills according to the old system of distillation. A few days before the commencement of the Hindu New Year the licenses for the sale of such spirit in the different parganas are sold by public auction, and the bidder is given a patta for one year. The patta contains the amount of the lease, permission to distil and sell the spirit wholesale and retail, and other important conditions. No duty of any kind is levied from the contractor.\n\n2. The following is the list of country-spirit shops:\n\n| Name of pargana | Name of locality |\n|-----------------|------------------|\n| Chamb\u00e1          | Chamb\u00e1           |\n| Bhatti-Tikri    | Hatl\u00ed            |\n| Sihunta         | Jolna and Sihunta |\n| Chu\u00e1ri         | Chu\u00e1ri and J\u00e1jri |\n| Ch\u00fan            | Eled, Khairi and Dhalog |\n| B\u00e1thri          | Bhagud           |\n| S\u00e1ch            | Khejh\u00e1r and Mangla |\n| Karedh          | Karedh           |\n| Tariod          | Pukhri           |\n| Bh\u00e1ndal         | Bh\u00e1ndal          |\n| Tisa            | Tisa             |\n| Dhundi          | Masrund          |\n| Basu            | Lothal           |\n| Lilh            | Bunkhri          |\n| Piuta           | Chhatr\u00e1ni        |\n| Kothi-Ranhu     | Kothi Ranhu      |\n| Brahmaur        | Ul\u00e1nsa, Khani and Brahmaur |\n| Trehta          | Holi and Chan    |\n| Chanota         | Ku\u00e1rsi and Sunas |\n\nThe contract is sold separately for each pargana and the contractor gives sub-contracts to open shops in his pargana. In addition to opening shops the contractor is authorised to sell spirits at the local fairs.\n\n3. No restriction is put upon the sale of European liquor nor is any license issued for it.\n\n1. Some opium is grown in the Chur\u00e1h Wiz\u00e1rat of the State, and the rest is imported from Amritsar and Hoshi\u00e1rpur. Charas is exclusively imported from these two Districts. No duty is imposed.\n2. A contract is given for wholesale and retail sale, and each contractor gives sub-contracts to open shops in his own il\u00e2qa. The following is the list of drug shops:\n\n| Name of il\u00e2qa | Name of locality |\n|---------------|-----------------|\n| Chamb\u00e2        | Chamb\u00e2           |\n| Bhatti-Tikri  | Hatli            |\n| Sihunta       | Sihunta and Jolna|\n| Raipur        | Raipur           |\n| Chu\u00e2ri        | Chu\u00e2ri and J\u00e2jri |\n| Hub\u00e2r         | Kokira           |\n| Ch\u00fbn          | Khairi           |\n| B\u00e2thri        | B\u00e2thri           |\n| S\u00e2ch          | Khaj\u00eear          |\n| Tisa          | Tisa             |\n| Bh\u00e2ndal       | Bh\u00e2ndal          |\n| Mahla         | Mahla            |\n| Brahmaur      | Brahmaur         |\n\n3. The contracts for the sale of opium and charas are sold together, not separately.\n\n4. The contracts for the sale of drugs and spirits are never sold jointly.\n\n5. No income-tax is levied in the State.\n\n1. The Indian Registration Act is not enforced, only deeds for mortgage and sale, etc., of immediate property being registered.\n\n2. Every deed is written on an eight-anna stamped sheet and the registration fees are as follows:\n\nFor amounts not exceeding Rs. 25 ... As. 4\n\" exceeding Rs. 25 but not exceeding Rs. 50 ... As. 8\n\" \" Rs. 50 \" \" Rs. 75 \" \" Rs. 100 Re. 1\n\nFor every additional sum of Rs. 100 ... Re. 1\nFor every additional sum of Rs. 25 or fraction thereof ... As. 4\n\n3. Registration is only effected at the following places:\n\n| Locality     | Agency                  |\n|--------------|-------------------------|\n| Sadr Chamb\u00e2  | The Prime Minister      |\n| F\u00e2ng\u00ee        | The Waz\u00eer-i-Wiz\u00e2rat     |\n| Chur\u00e2h       | Ditto                   |\n| Bhattiy\u00e2t    | Ditto                   |\n| Brahmaur     | Ditto                   |\n| Dalhousie    | Vakfl, Dalhousie        |\n\nThe estimated gross revenue of the State is Rs. 4,57,543, of which Rs. 2,18,199 is land revenue, and Rs. 2,39,344 profit derived from the forests and miscellaneous revenue. Out of this Rs. 3,800 are paid annually as tribute to the British Government.\nSection E.\u2014Local and Municipal.\n\nThere are no municipalities in Chamb\u00e1. The only town of sufficient size to require municipal works is the capital itself, and it is under the direct charge of the head of the Public Works Department. Being built on a slope the town is very easy to keep clean, and indeed the cleanliness of the streets reflects great credit on the management. There is an octroi duty levied on goods imported into the town. The bridge over the R\u00e1vi, below the town, is maintained by a toll levied on beasts of burden, riding horses, dandies, sheep and cattle, and on coolies bearing loads. Similar tolls are levied at the other bridges across the R\u00e1vi.\n\nSection F.\u2014Public Works.\n\nAll public works carried on in the State are under the control of the Superintendent of the Public Works Department. The main roads, bridges, and public buildings are under his care, and he also looks after the conservancy of the capital.\n\nSection G.\u2014Army.\n\nThere are no Imperial Service troops in Chamb\u00e1. There is, however, a State army consisting of about 300 men, including 30 horsemen. They are under the command of Captain Sri Kanth, Baratru, who received his military training at Bakloh with the IVth Gurkha Rifles. The army is in an excellent state of discipline. It is mainly used on occasions of ceremony as a guard-of-honour to H. H. the R\u00e1j\u00e1. There is a good parade ground just outside the city of Chamb\u00e1 on which the troops are drilled. There are three sets of barracks capable of holding the entire army. The R\u00e1j\u00e1 takes a keen interest in the welfare of his soldiers who are most comfortably housed. The army is mostly recruited from amongst the Rajputs and R\u00e1this, principally the latter. There are a few Brahmins. The service is a popular one. The men are armed with the rifle. There is no artillery. The cavalry are well mounted. Dr. Chatar Blnj is in medical charge of the troops.\n\nThere are no British or Indian Army regiments permanently stationed in Chamb\u00e1. But through the kindness of His Highness the R\u00e1j\u00e1, in recent years a wing of the IVth Gurkha Rifles from Bakloh has been permitted to camp for a few weeks in the summer on That, a hill in the neighbourhood of Dalhousie. The R\u00e1j\u00e1 also always accords permission to the General of the IIIrd (Lahore) Division to have British troops exercised in Chamb\u00e1 territory by route marching, regimental manoeuvres and military picnics. The relations existing between the British Military and the R\u00e1j\u00e1 have always been most cordial, though great care has to be exercised on the part of the former to avoid offending the caste feelings of the inhabitants of Chamb\u00e1. Friction of any sort has happily been non-existent up to the present.\nSection H.\u2014Police and Jails.\n\nThe head-quarters of the police are at the capital whence investigating officers are sent out when occasion arises. The only outpost is at Dalhousie where a Jamadar and 8 constables are stationed under the control of the State Vakil. Sometimes when an outbreak of epidemic disease occurs in a village a detachment of police is sent to the place to preserve order, and render any assistance that may be required. The whole body is under the direction of Mi\u00e1n Moti Singh, Superintendent of Police. They are recruited from amongst the Rajputs, Rathis and Batwals, and there are also some Muhammadans in the force. They are trained in Chamb\u00e1 itself, and the officers do not go to any British or other school to learn their duty. Beyond the annual visit of the Commissioner of Lahore, there is no European inspection or supervision exercised. Crime not yet having become a science in Chamb\u00e1, the methods adopted to combat it are not so scientific as in the rest of India. The system of identification by finger impression has not found its way into the State, nor do the police employ professional trackers in the search for criminals; there are no criminal tribes in Chamb\u00e1, nor have the police to exercise constant supervision over particular individuals. In fact the whole State is so backward in the profession of crime that it would be absurd to use the common standards in estimating the usefulness of the police force. It is sufficient to know that crime has not yet assumed proportions large enough to call for an elaborate provision of police methods, as they exist in places where crime is the sole means of support of a considerable portion of the community. Tables Nos. 47 and 48 shew the strength and working of the Police force.\n\nThere is but one jail in the whole State. It is situated in the capital and has accommodation for 120 prisoners. Table No. 49 gives detailed information as to the number of prisoners. All imprisonment is rigorous; that is, all prisoners are made to work if they are pronounced medically fit.\n\nThey work at road-making and similar occupations. They are also employed in the gardens of the R\u00e1j\u00e1 and the Jail garden.\n\nThe produce of the latter, after the daily wants of the prisoners themselves have been supplied, is sold and the average net profit on the working of the garden amounts to Rs. 150 per annum. There is no other jail industry carried on. The prisoners always wear light fetters on their ankles. There are no special arrangements for juvenile offenders. The health of the prisoners is looked after by the Chief Medical Officer of the State. The annual expenditure of the Jail, including the pay of the establishment, amounts to about Rs. 5,700.\nSection I.\u2014Education and Literacy.\n\nChamb\u00e1 Town has two English schools, one a High School maintained by the State, and the other an Anglo-Vernacular Middle School maintained by the Church of Scotland Mission which receives a grant-in-aid. The number of boys attending these schools in the year 1906 was 206. There are also several schools for girls in the capital in which the scholars are taught to read and sew. Two of the girls' schools are maintained by the Mission with a grant-in-aid from the State. The State Girls' School is held in the Rang Mahal. Some very attractive embroidery work is done in these schools. All the State schools are perfectly equipped, and the R\u00e1j\u00e1 takes as keen an interest in this branch of civilisation as in the many others introduced either by himself or his immediate predecessors.\n\nOutside the capital, as may be easily imagined, there is almost no school education. There is a small school in Churh under State control, but it is not largely attended. Tables Nos. 51-52 give the statistics as to the schools, and the amount expended on them by the State. The figures shewing the amount of literacy are given in Table No. 50.\n\nSection J.\u2014Medical.\n\nThe State Medical Department was first inaugurated in 1866 (vide page 111). The Sh\u00e1m Singh Hospital is the chief medical institution in Chamb\u00e1, and was built by the R\u00e1j\u00e1 whose name it bears. Along with a large out-patient department there are 40 beds for the accommodation of in-patients, and all medical and surgical requisites have been provided on a liberal scale. The building replaced an older structure erected in 1876 by Colonel Blair Reid, Superintendent of the State, which was demolished in 1891, when the Chaug\u00e1n was being enlarged.\n\nThe hospital staff consists of a State Surgeon with three hospital assistants. Dr. Barkhurdar Khan, the present State Surgeon, has been in charge since 1868, and to his skill and devotion the prosperity and efficiency of the hospital are chiefly due. The subordinate staff includes compounders, dressers and servants.\n\nThe popularity and usefulness of the institution may be gauged from the following table, showing the number of new patients and operations for the quinquennial period ending with 1906:\n\n| Year | Total number of new patients | Total number of operations |\n|------|-----------------------------|----------------------------|\n| 1902 | 11,720                      | 497                        |\n| 1903 | 10,896                      | 494                        |\n| 1904 | 9,681                       | 418                        |\n| 1905 | 10,935                      | 459                        |\n| 1906 | 9,729                       | 421                        |\n\n(1) These figures include patients treated by a Vaid in the town, whose services are retained by the State.\nAs the population of the capital is only 6,000, these figures show that patients come in considerable numbers from the out-lying parts of the State. The State also maintains a dispensary at Tisa\u2014the head-quarters of the Church Wizarat\u2014opened in 1881. It is under the charge of a Hospital Assistant and had an attendance of 3,372 new patients, and 178 operations in 1906.\n\nA leper asylum, begun by the Mission to Lepers in 1876, was taken over by the State in 1881, and since then has been wholly under State management. It usually has about 20 inmates, of whom more than half are supported by the Mission to Lepers.\n\nTable No. 54 shows the working of the Vaccination branch of the Medical Department, which is also under the control of the State Surgeon. Vaccination has practically been compulsory since 1876 and the State has been altogether free from the scourge of smallpox. Sporadic cases of the disease have occasionally been imported from without, but there has been no epidemic during that period.\n\nThe entire cost of the Medical Department is borne by the State and in 1906 it amounted to Rs. 12,520.\n\nThe Church of Scotland Mission also maintains a dispensary in Chamba, at which 6,080 new patients were treated in 1906; with 388 operations. Every year extensive medical missionary tours are also made throughout the State, during which a large amount of medical and surgical work is done. In addition, the services of a trained European nurse have for the past ten years been at the disposal of all who required them, especially in midwifery cases. The whole cost of the medical work is borne by the Mission.\nCHAPTER IV.\u2014PLACES OF INTEREST.\n\nChamba.\n\nChamba, the capital of the State, is situated on a plateau near the junction of the Saho with the R\u00e1vi (32\u00b0 33' N. and 76\u00b0 8' E.) and has a population of 6,000 souls. Behind and to the east rises the Sh\u00e1h Mad\u00e1r Hill crowned by a Muhammadan ziarat of the same name. To the south a small rocky spur from this hill slopes down towards the R\u00e1vi, and limits the town in that direction. To the north is the deep gorge of the Saho. In front and to the west the R\u00e1vi flows at the foot of a precipitous cliff 200 feet high.\n\nThe town occupies two terraces. On the lower terrace is the Chaug\u00e1n, or public promenade, a beautiful grassy sward, about half a mile in length, by eighty yards in width. It is almost level, and was used in former times for the game of hockey, as indeed it still is. Till recently the stone goals might be seen at both ends, but they were removed in 1890, in the course of some improvements carried out by the late R\u00e1j\u00e1. There is no tradition of its having been used as a polo ground in former times, though the name suggests this. It is, however, etymologically distinct from Chaug\u00e1n, the Persian name of polo, being of Sanskrit origin with the meaning \"four-sided.\" In addition to being a public promenade and place of recreation, the Chaug\u00e1n is also utilized on the occasion of all great State Darb\u00e1rs.\n\nAt the southern end of the Chaug\u00e1n is the Residency, standing in its own grounds, which are tastefully laid out and kept in good order. It is a large building in the ordinary bungalow style, and is elegantly furnished. The house was originally erected as the residence of the European Political Officers, on special duty from A.D. 1863 to 1885, but is now used as a Guest-house; and here Lord and Lady Curzon were entertained on the occasion of their visit to Chamba in 1900. On the eastern side of the Chaug\u00e1n are the H\u00e1zi B\u00e1g, the Club and the covered Tennis Court; and farther on is a line of shops, forming the chief bazar in the town. On the western side, the Chaug\u00e1n for nearly half its length overlooks the R\u00e1vi. Near the Chaug\u00e1n Gate are the Post and Telegraph Offices; and from this point another line of shops stretches as far as the Kotw\u00e1l\u00ed, close to which is the Bhuri Singh Museum. Between these and the precipice, the space is crowded with houses, forming the Kashmiri Mahalla.\n\nThe State Hospital, a picturesque looking building, stands at the north end of the Chaug\u00e1n, and behind it is the Forest Bungalow, while the new Guest-house occupies a very pleasant site overlooking the R\u00e1vi. The Mission Compound is to the north-east of the Hospital and contains two Mission Houses, a Dispensary and a Church.\n\n(1) The Bhuri Singh Museum was opened in 1906 and contains many objects of archaeological interest, of which an account will be found in the Museum Catalogue.\nOn the upper terrace the most conspicuous building is the palace, arranged in two large blocks. The northern portion contains the public Darb\u00e1r halls and living rooms, while the southern portion is the \"Bhera\" or Zan\u00e1n-Kh\u00e1na. The present building is modern, most of it having been erected during the reign of the late R\u00e1j\u00e1. The oldest portion is the north-west corner, called the Kandchandi, which was built in the reign of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Ummed Singh A.D. 1748-64. The Darb\u00e1r halls and apartments are all furnished in European style. The entrance to the palace is from the northeast, into an outer courtyard which is tastefully laid out in flower beds, with water fountains. To the south of the palace and adjoining it is the residence of the present R\u00e1j\u00e1, also tastefully furnished in European style.\n\nThe chief part of the town is situated to the east and south of the palace, and between it and the Sh\u00e1h Mad\u00e1r Hill. It consists of the dwelling houses of many of the high caste inhabitants, and of most of the State officials. Conspicuous among them is the Rang Mahal or Old Palace, though no portion of this building is really old, the foundations having been laid by R\u00e1j\u00e1 Ummed Singh A.D. 1748-64; and the superstructure, which is of brick, is probably of an even later date. The southern portion in English style was built about 1860 by R\u00e1j\u00e1 Sri Singh, who lived there in preference to the other palace. His remaining widow R\u00e1ni still reside in the Rang Mahal.\n\nThe water-course from the Sarota stream, made in the time of Sahil Varma (p. 73) enters the town at the foot of the Sh\u00e1h Mad\u00e1r Hill, and divides into several channels. At this point a flight of steep stone steps built by R\u00e1ni S\u00e1rd\u00e1, queen of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Jit Singh, A.D. 1794-1808, leads up the hill to the R\u00e1ni's shrine (p. 74). Another long flight of steps leads up the line of the rocky spur to the south of the town, as far as the Ch\u00e1munda Temple. These are said to have been built by R\u00e1j\u00e1 R\u00e1j Singh, A.D. 1764-94. From this temple a fine view is obtained up and down the valley. A new and commodious D\u00e1k Bungalow occupies a site to the south of the Residency in the suburb of Darogh, and the barracks for the State troops are situated to the south of the town near the village of Jal\u00e1khri.\n\nThe most striking objects of interest in Chamba are the old temples, which exhibit much architectural beauty of design and execution. On all the principal ones are to be seen carvings of an elaborate and ornate character and in general appearance they bear a strong resemblance to the temples in R\u00e1jp\u00far\u0101na, from which the design was probably taken. Chief among them are the six temples standing in a line on a platform near the north-west corner of the palace, three being dedicated to Vishnu and the same number to Shiva. The Hari R\u00e1i temple near the Chaug\u00e1n Gate is believed by the people to be very old, and a tradition runs that a shallow portion of the R\u00e1vi then flowed\nacross the Chaug\u00e1n, and the temple was reached by stepping stones. This is improbable as the R\u00e1vi cannot have flowed across the Chaug\u00e1n within the human period. At the north end of the H\u00e1zi B\u00e9gh stands the Champavati temple, whose legend will be found on page 74. It is the family temple of the Chamba R\u00e1j\u00e1s. Two other temples in the same style are found on the upper terrace\u2014that of Bans\u00ed-Gop\u00e1l near the eastern gate of the palace, and that of Sita R\u00e1m near the R\u00e1j\u00e1's house. Another temple, called Vajreshvari or Bhagavati, with fine carvings, stands at the entrance to the Sarota N\u00e1l\u00e1, and is seldom seen by visitors. The temples referred to are all shikhara, or spired temples as distinct from hill temples. Of the latter class one temple\u2014Ch\u00e1mund\u00e1 or Chaund\u2014stands on a small spur of the Sh\u00e1h Mad\u00e1r Hill. These temples have all been fully described in the Archaeology.\n\nThe new water-works now in course of construction will take the place of the open water-course made in the reign of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Sahil Varma, A.D. 920-40, and will greatly contribute to the health and comfort of the community and the salubrity of the town.\n\nThe works for an installation of the electric light in all the principal buildings of the town are also in progress and will soon be completed.\n\nKhaj\u00e1r.\n\nKhaj\u00e1r\u2014half-way between Chamba and Dalhousie (32\u00b0 38' N. and 76\u00b0 5' E.)\u2014is a very beautiful forest glade with a small lake in the centre in which is a floating island. The lake is about 13 feet deep, and near it stands an ancient temple to Khaji N\u00e1g, from which the place has received its name. The D\u00e1k Bungalow is open from April to November, and during the season Khaj\u00e1r is a favourite resort of visitors from Dalhousie.\n\nBrahmaur.\n\nBrahmaur is situated in the Budhil Valley, (32\u00b0 26' N. and 76\u00b0 82' E.) 48 miles to the south-east of Chamba, and is interesting as having been the ancient capital of the State for probably 400 years. The State kothi, destroyed in the earthquake of 4th April 1905, was believed to occupy the site of the old palace, but it is improbable that any part of the building was of great age. The temples with their images are remarkable as being among the oldest archaeological remains in the Chamba State.\n\nThe principal temples are those of Lakshana Dev\u00ed and Ganesa in the hill style and Mani Mahesa and Narsingh in the shikhara style of architecture. A description of these temples will be found in the Archaeology. A brazen bull of life size stands in front of the Mani Mahesa temple. There are inscriptions on the idols of Lakshana Dev\u00ed and Ganesa, and also on the pedestal of the\nbull which prove that they all date from the reign of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Meru Varma (A.D. 680-700). The level ground on which the temples stand is called the Chaur\u00e1si. Brahmaur is the headquarters of the winder of that name and has a season Post Office for six or seven months in summer. There is a Forest rest-house on a beautiful site, about a mile from the State koth\u00ed.\n\nAs the whole country around Brahmaur is supposed to belong to Shiva, it is sometimes spoken of as \"Shiv-bhumi,\" and being the home of the Gaddi tribe, it is also for this reason called Gadderan.\n\n**CHHATR\u00c1RI**\n\nChhatr\u00e1ri is situated 24 miles from Chamba (32\u00b0 27' N. and 76\u00b0 24' E.) on the way to Brahmaur, and is a tirtha or place of pilgrimage. The only object of interest is an ancient temple containing a brass image of Shakti Devi or K\u00e1li, which, as the inscription shows, was erected by R\u00e1j\u00e1 Meru Varma (A.D. 700, vide pp. 46 and 189). The workman, named Guzga, who erected the temples at Brahmaur, is said to have first built a house at Koth\u00ed Ranhu for the local R\u00e1na, and had his right hand cut off to prevent him from erecting as fine a residence for any one else. The hand is believed to have been miraculously restored by the goddess, Shakti, when he was called upon to build her temple at Chhatr\u00e1ri. Another tradition exists to the effect that Gugga was accidentally killed by a fall from the roof of the temple porch, after having all but completed his work. The name 'Chhatr\u00e1ri' is derived from the two words 'chhattis' and 'k\u00e1ri', meaning 36 l\u00e1rhis of land, the amount of the sisan grant formerly attached to the temple. This grant was made by R\u00e1j\u00e1 Bala Bhadra (A.D. 1589-1641). A mela is held here on the third day after the Durbashtmi mela at the Mani Mahesa Lake, on the arrival of a man with a lota of water from the lake, with which the idol at Chhatr\u00e1ri is bathed.\n\n**MANI MAHESA LAKE**\n\nTwo marches beyond Brahmaur in the Budhil Valley is Mani Mahes, (32\u00b0 23' N. and 76\u00b0 40' E.), one of the chief tirthas or places of pilgrimage in the State.\n\nThe lake is situated on a small plain in the Mani Mahes Range at an altitude of 13,000 feet above sea level, and at the base of the Kailas peak, 18,564 feet. The lake is of no great size, and on its margin is a small marble image of Shiva, called Chaumahha.\n\nA mela is held here every year on the eighth day of the light half of the moon in Bh\u00e1don or Asuj, which is frequented by pilgrims who come to bathe in the lake, from all the surrounding districts, and also from places far beyond the confines of the State, and even from distant parts of India.\nTisa.\n\nTisa is the headquarters of the Churah wizdrat and is 38 miles to the north of Chamba, on the way to Pangi (32\u00b0 50' N. and 76\u00b0 10' E.). Next to the capital it is the largest centre of trade in the State and has a Post Office, Dispensary and Rest-house.\n\nKilar.\n\nKilar is the headquarters of the Pangi wizdrat and is distant from Chamba about 68 miles (33\u00b0 5' N. and 76\u00b0 26' E.). The place is only a cluster of villages; Kilar itself being the seat of the State kothi and a forest rest-house. A season Post Office is open during summer from May till October, when all ordinary postal business is transacted. In a cedar grove near the rest-house is the temple of Dot Nag; whose legend is given on page 189; and in addition to the ordinary offerings a buffalo is said to be sacrificed every third, fifth or seventh year, in the month of Katak (October). A State official from Chamba visits Kilar for several months every summer for the disposal of Court cases and the collection of the revenue. He has the title of wazir.\n\nMindhal.\n\nMindhal is the name of a village in Pangi on the left bank of the Chandra-Bhaga, opposite Sich (32\u00b0 59' N. and 76\u00b0 27' E.). Here the temple of Chamunda or Mindhal Basan Devi is situated. This shrine has been a place of pilgrimage from ancient time, and its legend will be found on page 189. It is square in shape, with a pent roof in the usual style of devi temples in the hills. The structure is of wood and stone, and consists of a central cella with two verandahs, one being enclosed and the other open. The image is of black stone in human form, which is believed to have risen out of the ground, and to extend downwards to a great depth. A mela is held here in Bhadon, and is frequented by people from all the neighbouring valleys. As many as 100 sheep and goats are sacrificed on this occasion, and the blood flows into a hole near the temple door, and is believed to run down under ground to a pool near the river, which it tinges red. The people spend their time at this mela in drinking and dancing. The priest and chela are Brahmins.\n\nTriloknath.\n\nTriloknath temple is situated in Chamba-Lahul, (32\u00b0 40' N. and 76\u00b0 41' E.) at the village of Tunde, which is the residence of a local Rana or Thakur. The shikhara temple is similar to those of Chamba, but in front of it is an older shrine in the style of the hill temples. This is a Buddhist shrine, and the shikhara temple contains an image of the Bodhisattva Triloknath or Avalokiteshvara. The image is artistically carved in white marble and represents the figure of a man seated cross-legged, with six arms, three on each side; and about three feet in height. In front of the temple, and adjoining it, are places for the accommodation of\npilgrims, and others who may visit the shrine. There is a mela in August which is accompanied by drinking and dancing. No sacrifices are offered at the shrine, and the puja seems to consist chiefly in burning lights continuously in front of the image, and reciting passages from the Buddhist sacred books. These lights are made of wicks fed with ghi, and great numbers of them are arranged in a platter, and then lighted. The officiating priest is a lama and the control of the temple is entirely in the hands of the local R\u00e1na, whose residence is close at hand (vide p. 44).\n\nThis tirtha is visited by pilgrims from all parts of India, and also from Ladakh and Tibet proper, as well as the neighbouring mountains. Here Hindus and Buddhists meet and intermingle as if they were one. The pilgrims come either from the Kulu or the Pangi direction, and the Hindu sadhus frequently lose their lives in attempting to cross the high snowy passes into the R\u00e1vi Valley.\n\nAt the village of Markula or Udaipur, near Trilokn\u00e1th, is a Hindu shrine to Markula Devi or K\u00e1li, in which are some fine wooden carvings. An inscription on the image contains the name of the donor who was probably an ancestor of the R\u00e1na of Trilokn\u00e1th. A stone inscription, recently found, points to the Markula temple having originally been a Buddhist monastery.\n\nNear Trilokn\u00e1th may be seen the first signs of Buddhism, in the long low walls covered with loose stones, on each of which is inscribed the Buddhist prayer \"Om mani padme hun.\" \"Om, the jewel in the lotus, hun.\" These become more numerous, and also longer and more elaborate in British-L\u00e1hul. These walls are called m\u00e1ni, and it is considered an act of great merit to have contributed to their construction. The lettering is usually done by the lamas, who must be well remunerated for their trouble, and therein lies the merit of the deed.\nCHAMBA DIALECTS.\n\nBY\n\nThe Rev. T. Grahame Bailey, B.D., M.R.A.S.\n\nINTRODUCTION.\n\nFrom a linguistic point of view the State of Camba is intensely interesting. Situated, as it is, entirely in the hills, it lends itself to the perpetuation of diverse dialects. It is traversed from east to west by the Candra-Bh\u0101ga or Cin\u0101b River in the north, and the R\u0101vi in the south, which for part of their course through the State are no more than twenty miles apart. To the north and west lies the State of Jammu, to the east British L\u0101hul (frequently pronounced by Europeans Lahaul), to the south the British district of Kangr\u0101. The area of Camba is just over 3,000 square miles, yet there are six distinct forms of speech found within its borders. Speaking roughly we may allocate them as follows:\u2014in the north-west Cur\u0101hi, in the north-central portion of the State P\u0101ngw\u0101li, in the north-east Camba L\u0101huli, in the south-west Bhat\u0113\u0101li, in the south-east Bharmauri or G\u0101di; while round about Camba city, which lies in the south-west (but further north and east than the Bhat\u0113\u0101li area) the dialect spoken is Cam\u0113\u0101li. Of these all, except L\u0101huli, belong to what is at present called the Western Pahari language of the Northern Group of the Sanskritic Aryan Family, while L\u0101huli is classed as belonging to the Tibeto-Himalayan branch of the Indo-Chinese Family. (See Census of India 1901, Chapter on Languages.)\n\nThe grammar of Cam\u0113\u0101li is very much what we should expect from its geographical position. It makes its Genitive in -\u0101, its Dative in -\u014d, its Future in -\u016bt, it has a Stative Participle in -\u0101d, thus t\u012br\u0101d, in the state of having fallen, m\u0101r\u0101d, in the state of having been beaten, for the participle with having, it uses k\u0101r\u012b, as t\u012br\u012b k\u0101r\u012b, having fallen.\n\nBhat\u0113\u0101li has, in consequence of its position, affinities with Dogri, spoken in Jammu State, and with Kangr\u0101i, spoken in Kangr\u0101. In the Genitive it has -\u0101, in the Dative -\u012b or -\u0113, in the Future -\u0101 or -\u0101, (The dialects of Kangr\u0101, Mandi State and Suket State have also a Future in -\u0101 or -\u0101). Like Cam\u0113\u0101li it uses k\u0101r\u012b for the participle with\nhaving. Its Stative Participle is very interesting; it has two forms e.g., p\u0101da or p\u0101da, in the state of having fallen, \u0101ya or ay\u0101da, in the state of having come. A form very similar to p\u0101da or ay\u0101da is found in Kangra, but for the form in -\u0101da we have to go all the way to the State of Bagh\u0101t, south of Simla, where we find \u0101ya, r\u0101da, with the same meaning as Bha\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101l\u012b ay\u0101da, p\u0101da. Similarly g\u0101da, r\u0101da, in Bha\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101l\u012b correspond to g\u0101da, r\u0101da (or r\u0101da) in Bagh\u0101t, and mean 'in the state of having gone' and 'remained' respectively. The accent of participles in -\u0101da is on the antepenultimate.\n\nIn pronunciation Bha\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101l\u012b very much resembles Cam\u0101l\u012b. Both employ the cerebral l and n, and in both the sound given to h is midway between the sound in Urdu and Hindi and that in Panjabi. In Urdu and Hindi h is pronounced practically as it is in English. In Panjabi, when it appears either alone or in conjunction with b, g, j, d, \u1e0d, \u1e63, w, m, n, l, it has a deep guttural sound not wholly unlike the Arabic ain. In Bha\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101l\u012b and Cam\u0101l\u012b it is half-way between the two, while their pronunciation of h when it follows a vowel is nearly the same as in Panjabi, that is to say, h is almost inaudible itself, but raises the tone of the syllable in which it occurs. The pronunciation of h, found in these two dialects, is common to many hill dialects.\n\nCur\u0101hi, spoken in the north-west of Camba, has many features deserving of study. Its Genitive ends in -\u0101 or -\u0101, its Dative in -\u0101, its plural is generally the same as the singular, except in the Vocative, in this reminding us of dialects in Kal\u016b and the Simla States and also of the G\u0101di dialect of Camba. Its Pres. Participle ends in -\u0101da and its Stative Participle in -\u0101da. It is remarkable that if we reckon from the south (near Simla) northwards Cur\u0101hi is the first dialect we find with traces of the vocalic change known as epenthesis. Thus, kh\u0101ga, eat (inf.) fem. kh\u0101ni, kh\u0101da, eating, fem. kh\u0101ti. As we go north and north-west we find epenthesis to a greater extent in dialects like Bhadraw\u0101hi, still more developed in others more distant such as P\u014dgul\u012b and Kish\u1e6daw\u0101r\u012b, till we reach the highest stage of bewildering completeness in Kashmiri. The normal ending of the Cur\u0101hi Future is -\u0101da, -\u0101da in the 1st Pers. Sing. and Plur. and -\u0101da, -\u0101da in the Sing. and Plur. of the other persons, though -\u0101da, -\u0101da are also found in the 3rd Pers. Sing. and Plur. and occasionally -\u0101da in the 1st Pers. This matter of the Future is only one example of the deeply interesting problems arising out of Northern Himalayan dialects. If we take the distribution of the Future in l, we find that the following dialects have a Future with l, appearing in every person, Singular and Plural: Jammi Sir\u0101j\u012b, Bhadraw\u0101hi and P\u0101d\u0101ri in Jammi, Pangw\u0101li, Cam\u0101l\u012b and Bharma\u1e47i or G\u0101di in Camba, Inner Sir\u0101j\u012b in Kal\u016b, and the dialects of Jubbal in the Simla area. The following have l in the 2nd and\n3rd Persons\u2014Kul\u0101l, K\u016b\u1e6d\u1e6dhal\u012b (K\u016b\u1e6d\u1e6dhal and neighbouring States, including the Simla municipal area), the dialect of the British district of K\u014d\u1e6d Kh\u0101\u012b, and Bagh\u0101\u1e6d\u012b (Bagh\u0101\u1e6d State). Punchi in Punch State has the 2nd and 3rd Plur. in l, and Bha\u1e37\u1e63\u012b in Jammu State has l in the 2nd and 3rd Sing. and 1st and 2nd Plur. The dialects which like Cur\u0101\u1e25\u012b have m in the 1st Plur. are the Simla States dialects of K\u014d\u1e6d Gur\u016b, K\u014d\u1e6d Kh\u0101\u012b, K\u016b\u1e6d\u1e6dhal and Bagh\u0101\u1e6d, while the Jammu dialects of the Sir\u0101j, Bhadraw\u0101h and Bha\u1e37\u1e63 have both m and l combined in the 1st Plur.\n\nWe notice then the interesting fact that, in the middle of the dialects which have l in the Future, extending from Punch to Jubbal we have as a wedge an area which has its Futures in g or gh, comprising the dialects of Bha\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101l (Camba), Kangr\u0101, Mandi and Sukh\u0101t, this wedge extending right up to the Tibeto-Himalayan language area. We notice, too, that the central portion of the districts, which make the Future in l, keeps the l purer than the more outlying: thus Cur\u0101\u1e25\u012b and the dialects beyond to the north and north-west, in common with the Simla dialects in the south, introduce m.\n\nThe great interest in Cur\u0101\u1e25\u012b lies in the fact that it is the first stage on the linguistic road to Kashmiri. South and east of Cur\u0101\u1e25\u012b we do not notice special Kashmiri characteristics, but as soon as we begin to study this dialect we feel the force of those tendencies which find fuller and fuller scope as we go north and west till we reach the Kashmiri area.\n\nThe Bharmauri or G\u0101\u1e0d\u012b dialect is spoken by the Gaddis who inhabit the district called Gadh\u0101ran, which includes Bharmaur in Camba State and the adjoining part of Kangr\u0101 District. It has been somewhat fully treated of along with the Kangr\u0101 dialect itself in the Appendix to the Kangr\u0101 Gazetteer, to which I may perhaps be permitted to refer the student. To have bound it up with the rest of the Camba dialects would have unduly swelled the dimensions of this volume in its Gazetteer form, so I deemed it better to omit it.\n\nTo my great regret I was unable when in Camba to meet with any speakers of Panjw\u0101l\u012b, the dialect of P\u0101ng\u012b. Grammatical information bearing upon it exists in two manuscripts, both compiled by the orders of H.H. the R\u0101ja of Camba, one a few years ago for the Linguistic Survey of India, and one two years ago for myself. These manuscripts, however, differ, in important particulars, and while undoubtedly valuable facts can be gleaned from a comparison of the two, one cannot feel the same certainty as to the accuracy of the result, as one would if one had had opportunity of making a personal study of the dialect. It resembles in a number of details the P\u0101\u1e0d\u0101r\u012b dialect spoken in the district of P\u0101\u1e0dar in Jammu State two or three stages further down the Cin\u0101b than P\u0101ng\u012b.\n\nLinguistically the chief interest of Camba centres in L\u0101h\u016bli, spoken\nin the north-east portion of the State. In British L\u0101hul to the east of Camba L\u0101hul, there are three dialects of L\u0101huli. There the Bh\u0101ga flowing from the north-east in a south-westerly direction is joined by the Candra coming from the south-east in a north-westerly direction. The united stream flows for some little distance before entering Camba L\u0101hul. The dialect spoken in the Bh\u0101ga Valley is called Ban\u016bn or G\u0101r\u012b or G\u0101r\u012b, that in the Candra Valley is called Rangloi, and the dialect of the valley of the united stream is known as Patni, Patan or Man\u0101\u1e6di. The dialect of Camba L\u0101hul we may call, for want of a better name, Camba L\u0101huli. L\u0101huli will thus be seen to comprise four dialects. L\u0101huli bears some resemblance to Tibetan, to Kan\u0101shi (the remarkable language spoken in a single village in Kul\u016b called Mal\u0101\u1e47a or Mal\u0101\u1e47i), and to Kan\u0101wari, spoken in Kan\u0101war in Bashahr State. The resemblance of Camba L\u0101huli to the other dialects and languages mentioned, as brought out by a list of between thirty and forty common words taken at a random, may be seen at glance in the following table:\n\nPercentage of words in which Camba L\u0101huli resembles:\n\n| Language   | Percentage |\n|------------|------------|\n| Patni      | ... 63     |\n| Rangloi    | ... 37     |\n| G\u0101r\u012b       | ... 30     |\n| Kan\u0101shi    | ... 29     |\n| Tibetan    | ... 22     |\n\nand in a briefer list of Kan\u0101wari words 47. The number of words in the lists, which appeared identical with the corresponding Camba L\u0101huli words, was Patni 14, Rangloi 8, G\u0101r\u012b 2, Kan\u0101shi 6, Tibetan 3, Kan\u0101wari 3. The lists with which the Camba L\u0101huli words were compared are those printed by Mr. A. H. Diack in 1896. Such a comparison may lead, however, to an incorrect conclusion. A similar comparison between, say, English and German, would yield a very high percentage of resemblances, yet the two languages are perfectly distinct. We may feel quite sure that an inhabitant of Camba L\u0101hul would find it impossible to understand any dialect or language in the list except Patni.\n\nThe chief difficulty of Camba L\u0101huli lies in its verb. A number of questions suggest themselves to which I am not at present able to give an answer. Thus there seem to be two forms of the Present and Imperf. Indic., each tense having a form connected with the Infinitive, and one connected with the Future, thus:\u2014k\u0101, strike, beat, (Infinitive), Fut. k\u0101d\u014dg. The Present tense has k\u0101d\u014d and k\u0101d\u014d, Imperf. k\u0101d\u0113g, k\u0101d\u0113g.\n\nk\u0101r\u012b, say, Fut. k\u014d (k\u014dg). Pres. Ind. k\u0101r\u014dd\u014d, ku\u0101d\u014d, Imperf\nAPPENDIX I.\n\nA CHAMBY\u0100LI VOCABULARY\n\nDrawn from title-deeds of the 16th and 17th Centuries.\n\nSkr. = Sanskrit  H. = Hindi\n\nVERBS.\n\n1.

In the case of the Verb pipi, arrive, Fut. pip\u014d (pip\u014dg) we have in addition to Pres. pip\u0101do, and Imperf. pip\u0101d\u0113g, forms from some other root p\u012bjido, and p\u012bjideg.\n\nThe questions suggest themselves\u2014are the forms derived from the Infinitive and the Future identical in meaning or not? Should we expect to find them in every verb?\n\nThe Past is even more interesting. It appears to have seven forms, ending in -t\u0113g, -d\u0113g or -d\u0113g, -ta, -da, -do, -to, and a shorter form ending in -g. Thus we have:\n\n- from k\u016bri, say, kut\u0113g, kuta, k\u016big, I said.\n- th\u0101t, do, th\u0101teg, th\u0113g (th\u0101deg is probably Imperf.).\n- rand\u0113g, give, rand\u0113g, randa, reg.\n- pipi, arrive pig.\n- sh\u012bzi, take away, sh\u012bda.\n- id\u0113, go, id\u0113g, id\u014d.\n- shubi, become, shuteg, shute.\n\nThere is even another form in -ga as kh\u014dsiga from kh\u014dsi, be obtained. We have also r\u0113 from rand\u0113g, give. Have all these forms the same meaning, or do they really represent different tenses?\n\nThe rules for the formation of the negative are sometimes very complicated, or the formation is very irregular. The general rule is that the negative is formed in the Imperative by prefixing tha and in other tenses by prefixing ma, but we have:\n\n- n\u0113g, I shall know, mai\u0113ng, I shall not know.\n- id\u0113g, I went, neg. iggi\u0113mu.\n- d\u0113p\u014dg, I shall fall, neg. ma dag.\n- ab\u014dg, I shall come, neg. m\u0101ng.\n- il, go (Imperative) neg. thel.\n- \u0101dani, come (Imperative plural) neg. th\u0101dani.\n\nIn iggi\u0113mu, I did not go, and \u0101gg\u0113mu, I did not come, (from and\u0113g I came), the ma of the neg. seems to have been changed to mu and added at the end.\n\nIt is worthy of note that the agent case of the subject is employed with every tense and mood of transitive verbs.\n\nSome of the final consonants, particularly the letter g, are frequently pronounced so faintly that it is almost impossible to say whether a word ends in a vowel or a consonant. This doubt arises especially in the case of the 1st Sing. of various tenses. Possibly in some cases it is equally correct to insert and to omit g.\n\nAn examination of the grammatical forms of Camba L\u0101huli which are given in their place will, it is trusted, reveal many points, in addition to those mentioned above, which are linguistically of the highest\ninterest, and which are worthy of full investigation. The grammar of L\u0101huli has an Aryan air about it, although the vocabulary is Tibeto-Himalayan. It might be equally correct to class it as an Aryan language.\n\nIn the Census of 1901 the number of speakers returned for the Camba dialects was as follows:\u2014Cam\u0101\u1e63\u012b, 37,433; C\u016br\u0101hi, 26,859; Bharmauri or G\u0101di 26,361; Bh\u014d\u1e6dia 24,299; Paggw\u0101li, 4,156; L\u0101huli 1,543. It is probable that the Bhat\u0113\u015b\u0101li speakers are included under Cam\u0101\u1e63\u012b; the figures returned under Bh\u014d\u1e6dia seem quite incorrect.\n\nThere is no literature in any Camba dialect except Cam\u0101\u1e63\u012b, in which the Gospels of Matthew (out of print), Mark and John, the Sermon on the Mount and the Ten Commandments have been printed. The Gospel of Luke is ready for the press. The character used is a slightly adapted form of T\u0101kri.\n\nThe system of transliteration adopted in the following pages is that of the Asiatic Society of Bengal. c stands for the sound of ch in child, ch being its aspirate; sh is sh in shout, while in sh the s and h are separate; \u0101, \u0113 denote \u0101, \u0113 followed by nasal n, and so for other vowels; \u1e5b denotes the sound of ng in singing, \u1e5b is a sound mid-way between r and r, u in italics occurring in a word in ordinary type denotes the sound half-way between \u016b and \u016b, and eu in italics denotes the short sound corresponding to \u016b.\n\nIn conclusion, I have to express my cordial thanks to the Rev. S\u014dhan L\u0101l, of the Church of Scotland Mission in Camba, for most valuable assistance, very willingly given, in connection with the Cam\u0101\u1e63\u012b dialect. In following his authority one cannot go wrong. If there are mistakes under the heading of Cam\u0101\u1e63\u012b the responsibility is mine. To Dr. Hutchison of Camba I am indebted for much personal kindness while engaged in this work. He lent me a copy of the parable of the Prodigal Son in Camba L\u0101huli, which he had in his possession, and which, although differing considerably from the translation here given, was of assistance to me in making it.\n\nThe enlightened ruler of Camba, H.H.

Cond. thus\u2014\n\nga\u012b\u0101 for gal\u0101\u0101, j\u0101 for j\u0101\u0101.\n\nHabit or continuance is expressed either by the Past Partic. with the required tense of karna, do, in which case the Past Partic. is indecl., or by the Pres. Partic. with r\u0101hna, remain. In the latter case both verbs agree with the nominative. Thus\u2014\n\ns\u0113 p\u0113\u0101 karda hai, he is in the habit of falling,\ns\u0113 p\u0113\u0101 kardi hai, she is in the habit of falling.\ns\u0113 p\u0101di r\u0101hndi hai, she continues falling, she is always falling.\n\nVery interesting examples of what appears to be the organic passive in \u0113 are found in some verbs, e.g., c\u0101hi\u0101da hai, from c\u0101ha\u1e47\u0101, wish, it is needed or fitting or necessary; samajhd\u0101 hai, from samajhd\u0101, understand, it is understood, &c. C\u0101hiy\u014d generally stands for the Hindi c\u0101hiye.\n\nIn Cam\u010d\u0101lt practically every Infinitive is pronounced with cerebral n, the ending being \u0101\u0101. In Panjabi after r, r, rh, rh, and in some parts of the Panjab after l, n is changed to n. In Urdu there is no cerebral n.\n\nNUMERALS.\n\nCardinal.\n\n| 1\u2014ikk. | 19\u2014unni. |\n| 2\u2014d\u0113. | 20\u2014b\u012bh. |\n| 3\u2014trai. | 27\u2014sat\u0101\u012b. |\n| 4\u2014caur. | 29\u2014upatt\u012b. |\n| 5\u2014panj. | 30\u2014trih. |\n| 6\u2014chi. | 37\u2014satattri. |\n| 7\u2014satt. | 39\u2014upt\u0101\u012b. |\n| 8\u2014\u0101\u1e6d\u1e6dh. | 40\u2014c\u0101j\u012b. |\n| 9\u2014nau. | 46\u2014chat\u0101\u012b. |\n| 10\u2014das. | 47\u2014sat\u0101\u012b. |\n| 11\u2014y\u0101r\u0101. | 49\u2014ann\u016bj\u0101. |\n| 12\u2014b\u0101r\u0101. | 50\u2014panj\u0101b. |\n| 13\u2014tshr\u0101. | 53\u2014trapunj\u0101. |\n| 14\u2014cand\u0101. | 57\u2014satunj\u0101. |\n| 15\u2014pandra. | 59\u2014un\u0101ht. |\n| 16\u2014so\u012b\u0101. | 60\u2014sat\u0101\u012b. |\n| 17\u2014sat\u0101r\u0101. | 67\u2014sat\u0101ht. |\n| 18\u2014\u0101\u1e6dh\u0101ra. | 69\u2014unhattar. |\n70\u2014sahattar.  \n77\u2014sathattar.  \n79\u2014un\u0101si.  \n80\u2014\u0101si.  \n87\u2014sat\u0101si.  \n89\u2014un\u0101n\u016b\u1e0d.\n\n90\u2014nabb\u0113.  \n97\u2014sat\u0101n\u016b\u1e0d.  \n100\u2014sau.  \n200\u2014d\u014d sau.  \n900\u2014naan sau.  \n1000\u2014haj\u0101r.\n\n100,000\u2014lakkh.\n\nOrdinal, \u00a7c.\n\n1st, pail\u0101.  \n2nd, d\u016bw\u0101.  \n3rd, triyy\u0101.  \n4th, cauth\u0101.  \n5th, panj\u0101s.\n\nik w\u0113ri, once.  \nd\u014d w\u0113ri, twice.  \npaili w\u0113ri, first time.  \nd\u016bwi w\u0113ri, second time.  \nd\u014d gu\u1e47\u0101, two fold.  \ntrai gu\u1e47\u0101, three fold.  \naddh\u0101, half.\n\n6th, chath\u0101.  \nchath\u016b\u1e0d.  \n7th, sat\u016b\u1e0d.  \n10th, das\u016b\u1e0d.  \n50th, panj\u0101h\u016b\u1e0d.\n\ndaidh, 1\u00bd.  \npaun\u1e0d d\u014d, 2\u00bd.  \nsaw\u0101 d\u014d, 2\u00bc.  \ndh\u0101i, 2\u00bd.  \ns\u0101\u1e0dh\u0101 caur, 4\u00bd.  \nikk p\u0101o, \u00bc.  \ntrai cauth\u0101i \u00be.\n\nIt should be noted that in sathattar, seventy-seven, the t and h are pronounced separately. The word is sat-hattar, not sa-thathar.\n\nOrdinal numerals are ordinary Adjectives declined like Adjectives in -\u0101; those ending in -\u0101 retain their nasalization when inflected.\n\nEven cardinal numbers are generally inflected when used with nouns in an oblique case. Thus the inflected form of d\u014d is da\u016bh, of trai tr\u0101th, of caur ca\u016bh, of chi ch\u012b\u1e0d\u0101.\n\nThere is still a further inflection sometimes seen in the Locative case, as ca\u016bhni bakkhi, on four sides, all round.\n\ni\u014d, is sometimes added for emphasis, d\u014di\u014d, the two of them.\n\nSentences.\n\n1.

A list of all the letters of any historical interest, giving their general purport, will be found in the Museum Catalogue. Most of these letters were found after the History had been printed.\n\nC, I. Sanad in Persian given in the reign of Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n, regarding a boundary dispute between Prith\u00ed Singh of Chamb\u00e1 (A.D. 1641\u20141664) and Sangr\u00e1n P\u00e1l of Balaur in which it is set forth that the pargan\u00e1 of Bhalai belongs to Chamb\u00e1 territory. It bears the autographs in T\u00e1nkar\u00ed of various R\u00e1j\u00e1s and officials, and some seal impressions in Persian. Its date is the 19th of the month of Safar, A.H. 1058, corresponding to the 5th March, A.D. 1648. Vide pages 92 and 94 of Gazetteer.\n\nC, 4. Sanad of the reign of 'Alamg\u00edr Aurangzeb (A.D. 1658\u20141707) under the seal of M\u00edr Kh\u00e1n, an imperial officer to R\u00e1j\u00e1 Shatar Singh of Chamb\u00e1 (A.D. 1664\u20141690) in which it is notified that the pargan\u00e1 of Bhalai, which had been seized by Sangr\u00e1n P\u00e1l of Balaur is made over to Chamb\u00e1 and that the pargan\u00e1 of Bhadraw\u00e1h which had been given to Sangr\u00e1n P\u00e1l, is now transferred to Chamb\u00e1. If a sanad for the two pargan\u00e1s is required, it will be procured from the Emperor. Sangr\u00e1n P\u00e1l is directed to make over both 'il\u00e1g\u00e1s to Shatar Singh and afterwards present himself before the Viceroy. Dated 22nd Ramz\u00e1n in the 8th year of Aurangzeb's reign. (As Aurangzeb ascended the throne on the 1st of Zu-l-q\u00e1'dah, A.H. 1068 corresponding to the 1st of May, A.D. 1658, the 8th year of his reign began from the 1st Zu-l-q\u00e1'dah, A.H. 1075; and the date of the present document would fall in the ensuing Hijr\u00ed year 1076, and correspond to Sunday, the 18th March 1666).\n\nC, 6. Sanad in Persian issued under the seal of Zakariy\u00e1 Kh\u00e1n, Governor of the Panj\u00e1b, in the reign of Muhammad Sh\u00e1h. In it the pargan\u00e1 of Pathy\u00e1r in the K\u00e1ngr\u00e1 district is bestowed as a j\u00e1g\u00edr on R\u00e1j\u00e1 Diler Singh of Chamb\u00e1 (A.D. 1735\u20141748) on account of his loyalty to the king of Delhi. It is dated in the 27th year of the reign of Muhammad Sh\u00e1h, (A.D. 1710\u20141748) and on the 5th of the month of Safar, A.H. 1157, corresponding to the 9th March, A.D. 1744.\n\nC, 7. Order under the seal of Muhammad Hay\u00e1t Kh\u00e1n, an imperial officer, in the reign of Muhammad Sh\u00e1h, to the Zam\u00edn-d\u00e1rs, Q\u00e1n\u00fangos, Muqaddams and cultivators of Pathy\u00e1r pargana. It states that the j\u00e1g\u00edr of Pathy\u00e1r, worth 3,80,000 d\u00e1ms (i.e., Rs. 9,500) was for a long time in the possession of the R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Chamb\u00e1, but the Katoches seized it and brought the Zam\u00edn-d\u00e1rs under their control. As R\u00e1j\u00e1 Diler Singh of Chamb\u00e1 had always been faithful to the Emperor, to whom the pargan\u00e1 of right belongs; and as Udai Singh, his elder brother, had held high rank and also the 'il\u00e1g\u00e1s of Dun and Nadaun in j\u00e1g\u00edr, therefore the above-mentioned pargan\u00e1 (Pathy\u00e1r) is confirmed to Diler Singh and the Zam\u00edn-d\u00e1rs are enjoined to look to him as j\u00e1g\u00edrd\u00e1r and to render all due service. It is dated 11th Muharram in the 20th year of Muhammad Sh\u00e1h's reign or A.H. 1159 (=23rd January 1746).\n\nNote.\u2014The j\u00e1g\u00edr held by R\u00e1j\u00e1 Udai Singh was probably the same as that granted to R\u00e1j\u00e1 Prith\u00ed Singh (vide p. 93) which seems to have remained in the possession of the State till the reign of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Ugar Singh. Its annual value was Rs. 16,000 and it is said to have been in Jav\u00e1n.\nERRATA.\n\nC. 4. For 1st of May read 20th July.\nC. 6. \" A. H. 1157 read A. H. 1158.\nC. 6. \" 9th March A.

Sanad under the seal of Mu'in-ud-din Khan (Mir Mannu), Viceroy of the Panjab, in the reign of Ahmad Shah (A.D. 1748\u20141754) to the Chaudhri, Qanungos and cultivators of Palam and Barne. It states that as this jagir has been the hereditary property of Raja Umed Singh of Chamba, it is now again declared to be his of right, in return for services rendered to the Emperor. They are enjoined to pay the revenue to him and to be obedient to his orders. Dated on the 5th of Jamad-us-sani in the 4th year of Ahmad Shah's reign or A.H. 1164 corresponding to 20th April 1751 A.D.\n\nC, 11. Order in Persian under the seal of Rahmat Ali Khan in the reign of Alamgir II (A.D. 1754\u20141759) to the Zamindars, Muqaddams and cultivators of Pathyar pargana stating that since the death of the Rana of Pathyar the said pargana has been the jagir of Raja Umed Singh of Chamba, and on account of his services and faithfulness, the jagir is confirmed to him. Therefore the Zamindars, etc., should render all dues to the said Raja and not be disobedient. It is dated on the 15th Jamad-ul-awwal, and in the 5th year of the reign of Alamgir. The seal date is A.H. 1171.\n\nThe corresponding Christian date for A.H. 1172 would be Sunday, 14th January 1759.\n\nC, 12. Order in Persian under the seal of Adina Beg Khan in the reign of Alamgir II (1754\u20141759) to the deputies of the Chakla of Jammu. They are advised that the ilaq of Jundh with its 17 castles was in the possession of Chamba under Raja Ugar Singh, but owing to his unfaithfulness it was given to Medini Pal, Balauria. Now since Raja Umed Singh is faithful to the Emperor the ilaq with its castles is restored to his control. He should take and retain possession, and the Balaurias are to have no authority in the ilaq. The officers of the Chakla are directed to carry out these instructions. It is dated on the 21st Zilhijja in the 5th year of the reign of Alamgir. On the seal the date is A.H. 1163 (A.D. 1754-5).\n\nThe date for A.H. 1172 corresponds to 26th August 1758 A.D.\n\nC, 13. Order in Persian under the seal of Rahmat Ali Khan in the reign of Alamgir II (1754-59) to the Chandhris, Zamindars and subjects of the pargana of Pathyar. As the pargana has, since the death of Rana Sila Chand of Pathyar, been in the possession of Raja Umed Singh of Chamba and in accordance with the parvada of Nawab Bahrnam Jang has been free of all revenue charges, and as the said Raja has always been zealous and faithful, the jagir is granted free of revenue dues. The Zamindars, etc., are enjoined to perform their duty to the Raja. The letter is dated in the 2nd Jamad-us-sani, A.H. 1172. Seal date A.H. 1171. (The date for A.H. 1172 would correspond to Wednesday, 31st January 1759).\n\nBahrnam Jang is better known as Adina Beg. He died on the 11th Muharram 1172 A.H.\n\nC, 15. Royal sanad in Persian, issued under the seal of Ahmad Shah Durani, by which the pargana of Pathyar in the Kangra district is confirmed as a jagir to Raja Umed Singh of Chamba (A.D. 1748\u20141764) on the recommendation of Raja Ranjit Dev of Jammu who is described as a relative of the Chamba Raja. The date is the month of Ziya'dah, A.H. 1175, corresponding to May-June, A.D. 1762. It was, consequently, issued at the time of Ahmad Shah's sixth invasion of the Panjab, and shortly after his victory over the Sikhs at Kot Rahira near Ludhiana, in February 4762 (cf. Latif, History of the Panjab, p. 283 f).\n\nNote.\u2014Letters C 6, C 15, were found after the History was printed. It is clear from them that the pargana of Pathyar in Palam was conferred on Raja Dalel or Diler Singh, and afterwards confirmed to Raja Umed Singh, vide page 98.\nC, 16. Royal sanad in Persian, in which R\u00e1j\u00e1 Umod Singh of Chamb\u00e1 (A.D. 1748\u20141764) is admonished to make over to Saif \u2019Al\u00ed Kh\u00e1n, the Governor of Kangr\u00e1, the revenue of certain lands belonging to the village of Chari in the Kangr\u00e1 district, of which \u201ccertain persons\u201d (apparently the R\u00e1j\u00e1 himself) had taken possession. The letter is dated in the month Rabi-ul-awwal, A.H. 1176, corresponding to September-October A.D. 1762, and, therefore, falls (like No. C, 15) in the time of Ahmad Sh\u00e1h\u2019s sixth invasion of the Panj\u00e1b.\n\nThis is evidently the letter referred to by Mr. Barnes in the Kangr\u00e1 Settlement Report (vide page 98 of the Gazetteer), but it is clear that it was issued by Ahmad Sh\u00e1h Dur\u00e1n\u00ed and not by his namesake, the king of Delhi, who was blinded and deposed on the 5th June A.D. 1754. It was found after the History was printed.\n\nC, 17. Royal sanad in Persian, issued under the seal of Tim\u00far Sh\u00e1h and addressed to R\u00e1j\u00e1 Raj Singh of Chamb\u00e1 (A.D. 1764\u20141794), in answer to a letter in which the R\u00e1j\u00e1 had offered his services to the king and invited him to visit the country. In his reply the king praises the rulers of Chamb\u00e1 for their devotion to him and his father \u201cnestled in Paradise,\u201d and promises that when time allows, he will accept the R\u00e1j\u00e1\u2019s invitation. The document, which is composed in very high-flown language, is dated on the 18th of the month Rabi-us-s\u00e1n\u00ed, A.H. 1191, corresponding to the 26th May, A.D. 1777, and, consequently, falls in the time of Tim\u00far Sh\u00e1h\u2019s invasion of the Panj\u00e1b in A.D. 1777 (Latif, op. cit., p. 299).\n\nC, 22. Agreement in T\u00e1nk\u00e1r\u00ed between R\u00e1j\u00e1 Raj Singh of Chamb\u00e1 and Fateh P\u00e1l of Bhadraw\u00e1h. Fateh P\u00e1l is made R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Bhadraw\u00e1h on the following conditions which he accepts:\n\n(1). That he will be faithful to Chamb\u00e1. (2). That whenever summoned he will come to Chamb\u00e1. (3). That he will give Jai Chand\u2019s j\u00e1gir to Bh\u00fap Chand. (4). That he will not enter into an alliance with Balaur, Kashtw\u00e1r or Behandr\u00e1t\u00e1, and will do nothing without consulting Chamb\u00e1. (5). That the Chamb\u00e1 troops will remain at Bhadraw\u00e1h, and Fateh P\u00e1l will provide supplies and give no trouble. (6). That if he has any communications from Balaur, Kashtw\u00e1r or Behandr\u00e1t\u00e1, he will keep the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Chamb\u00e1 fully informed regarding them. (7). That he will maintain his alliance with Chamb\u00e1 only. (8). That Chamb\u00e1 is supporting Mi\u00e1n Kundan Singh in his attempt to gain Kashtw\u00e1r, and Fateh P\u00e1l must also send a force. (9). That his tribute money shall be Rs. 3,000 yearly, which must be regularly paid. It is not dated. (Fateh P\u00e1l, the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Bhadaw\u00e1h, was born in A.D. 1732. His younger brother was Mi\u00e1n Bh\u00fap Chand who was married to the Chamb\u00e1 princess Atharb\u00e1nu. Both Fateh P\u00e1l and Bh\u00fap Chand died at Chamb\u00e1 in the Pakk\u00ed Chauki, i.e., the old palace, and Atharb\u00e1nu became a sati on the Chandrabh\u00e1g\u00e1. Pah\u00e1r Chand, the son of Bh\u00fap Chand and Atharb\u00e1nu, was the last of the Bhadarw\u00e1h R\u00e1j\u00e1s. He died at Amritsar. Cf. Annual Progress Report, Archaeological Survey, Panj\u00e1b and United Provinces, 1903-04, pp. 63 ff.)\n\nC, 25.

The document is dated on the 7th of the month of K\u00e1ti (K\u00e1rttika) in the S\u00e1stra year 58, corresponding to A.D. 1782. It belongs to Captain Sr\u00ed Kanth Baratru.\n\nC, 29.

Dated 18th Bh\u00e1don, S\u00e1stra year 59 (A.D. 1783). (This letter was evidently an immediate result of the conquest of Bas\u00f3hl\u00ed by R\u00e1j Singh, which took place A.D. 1782. Cf. Forster op. cit., Vol. I., p. 270).\n\nC, 33. Agreement in T\u00e1nkar\u00ed between R\u00e1j\u00e1 R\u00e1j Singh of Chamb\u00e1 and Day\u00e1 P\u00e1l of Bhadarw\u00e1h, similar to C, 22.

Letter in T\u00e1nkar\u00ed from R\u00e1j\u00e1 Jit Singh of Chamb\u00e1 to R\u00e1j\u00e1 Tegh Singh of Kashtw\u00e1r, stating that if Kashtw\u00e1r is invaded, Chamb\u00e1 will send a force and that Kashtw\u00e1r must help if Chamb\u00e1 is at war with another power. Kashtw\u00e1r is asked to send a force to Bhadarw\u00e1h for which Chamb\u00e1 will provide supplies. The tenor of the letter implies that Kashtw\u00e1r was then subject to Chamb\u00e1. It is dated 1st Jeth Sambat 79, A.D. 1803 (Tegh Singh was the last of the Kashtw\u00e1r R\u00e1j\u00e1s. Cf. Vigne Travels, Vol. I., p. 181.)\n\nC, 54. Treaty in T\u00e1nkar\u00ed between R\u00e1j\u00e1 Sans\u00e1rd Chand of Kangr\u00e1 and R\u00e1j\u00e1 Jit Singh of Chamb\u00e1, concluding an alliance between the two States and stipulating that Chamb\u00e1 must send a force to the support of Kangr\u00e1 in case of war. Dated 17th Maghair, Sambat 79, A.D. 1803.\n\nC, 57. A letter in N\u00e1g\u00e1r\u00ed from Amar Singh Th\u00e1p\u00e1 and Ranjor Singh to R\u00e1j\u00e1 Jit Singh. He is admonished not to be afraid of Kangr\u00e1 (Trigadh). The Gurkh\u00e1s, Chamb\u00e1 and Kahl\u00far (Bil\u00e1spur) are all one and Chamb\u00e1 is the Waz\u00edr of the Gurkh\u00e1s. Jit Singh is asked to obtain help from the R\u00e1j\u00e1s of the Dugar States, he is to keep a part of his army at Rihlu and send the rest to Sampat P\u00e1l. The letter states that the Katoch troops had seized P\u00e1l\u00e1m, but the Gurkh\u00e1s drove them out and occupied the Pathy\u00e1r fort. There is much need of money and the Waz\u00edr (probably Nathu of Chamb\u00e1) had written for Rs. 4,000. This sum is to be sent at once and news will be received in two months. The letter is not dated but was probably written in A.D. 1806. Vide pp. 102\u20143.\nC, 59.

In exchange for Rihlu the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 confers the State of Bhadraw\u00e1h on Chamb\u00e1, the only condition being that Mi\u00e1n Pah\u00e1r Chand of Bhadraw\u00e1h is to receive a j\u00e1gir of Rs. 3,000. The tribute money due from Chamb\u00e1 to the Sikhs is also remitted, as well as certain obligations of service to Sikh Sard\u00e1rs, except to Des\u00e1 Singh (who was then Governor of the Hills). It is stipulated that Nathu Waz\u00edr is to be in attendance on the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1. A village in Rihlu of the value of Rs. 1,000 is also conferred on R\u00e1j\u00e1 Charhat Singh for the sake of the rice. Dated 27th Jeth Vik. 1878, A. D. 1821.

The ruling families were all of the Surajbansi race, except Chaneoi, Balaur, Bhadu, Bhadraw\u00e1h and Kashtw\u00e1r, which were Chandarbansi.\n\nJammu.\u2014This State which is very ancient, was originally of small size, and is first mentioned in two Chamba copper plates of the 11th century under its former name of Durgara,(2) of which Dugar is a derivation. These inscriptions prove that Dugar existed as a State, ruled by its own chief, in the beginning of the 10th century. The capital was then probably at Babbapura\u2014now Babor\u201417 miles east of Jammu, where ancient remains are found. Two, and possibly three, R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Babbapura are referred to in the R\u00e1ja Tarangini as having been subject to Kashmir in the 11th and 12th centuries. Jammu became the capital in the 13th or 14th century and is frequently referred to in Muhammadan history, from the time (A.D. 1398) when it was captured by Tamarlang. In the 35th year of Akbar (A.D. 1595) a force was sent to subdue the hills, and the R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Jammu, Jasrota, Mankot, Lakhapur, Bhadu and Ballaur tendered their submission. It is noteworthy that, of the eleven States of the Dugar group no fewer than four(3)\u2014Jammu, Jasrota, Mankot and S\u00e1mba\u2014were ruled by branches of the same family, from the Manh\u00e1s clan of Surajbansi R\u00e1jputs. Jasrota, Mankot, S\u00e1mba and Lakhapur were probably all founded by cadets of the Jammu family and were originally dependent on Jammu. Among the later rulers of Jammu the most famous was R\u00e1ja Ranjit Dev (A.D. 1750\u201481). The senior branch of the Jamw\u00e1l family was expelled by Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 Ranjit Singh in 1816, and now resides at Akhrota near Dinanagar in the Gurdaspur District. In 1820-21 Jammu was conferred as a fief on R\u00e1ja Gul\u00e1b Singh\u2014the head of the junior branch of the Jamw\u00e1l family. The Punch State was about the same time conferred on his brother, R\u00e1ja Dhi\u00e1n Singh, and still remains in his family.\n\nJasrota.\u2014This was a small State with the capital at Jasrota in the outer Siwaliks. It was probably founded in the 14th or 15th century, and may have been previously a fief dependent on Jammu. Very little is known of its subsequent history, and it was overturned and annexed to Jammu in 1835. The family resides near Nagrota in Jammu territory.\n\nMankot.\u2014This place is now called R\u00e1mkot, and is situated in the Siwaliks, to the north of Jasrota. The State seems to have been founded about the same time as Jasrota and maintained its existence till 1821, when it was annexed by R\u00e1ja Gul\u00e1b Singh. The family resides at Sal\u00e1ngari, Kotlehr, in the Kangra District. The late head of this family, R\u00e1ja Balbir Singh, served for 19 years in the 13th Bengal Lancers, and rose to the rank of Ress\u00e1ldar-Major. He took part in the Afghan War, 1879\u201481, and also in the Egyptian War with Arabi Pasha for both of which he held decorations.\n\n(1) In addition to the 11 States named there were 11 more between the R\u00e1vi and the Jhelum; four being between the R\u00e1vi and Chen\u00e1b, and seven between the Chen\u00e1b and the Jhelum. Hence the saying current in the hills, \"B\u00e1idn vich Jammu Sird\u00e1r hai.\" \"Among the 22 Jammu is Head.\"\n\n(2) V\u00edde J. R. A. S., 1907, pp. 403\u20146.\n\n(3) Originally five, for Lakhapur was also ruled by a branch of the Jamw\u00e1l family. It afterwards became merged in Jasrota.\nS\u00e1mba.\u2014This was a small State to the west of Jasrota, also ruled, like Jasrota and Mankot, by a branch of the Jamw\u00e1l family. It was annexed by R\u00e1j\u00e1 Gul\u00e1b Singh about the same time as the two previous States, and the direct line of the ruling family is now extinct.\n\nCh\u00e1neni.\u2014Ch\u00e1neni, the capital, is situated to the north of Jammu on the Tawi. The ancient name of the State, which was founded probably in the 11th century, was Hiunta, Himta, or Himat and it was ruled by a family of Chandarbansi R\u00e1jputs from Kahl\u00far (Bil\u00e1spur) which originally came from Ch\u00e1nd\u00e9ri in Malwa.(1) The State was seized by R\u00e1j\u00e1 Gul\u00e1b Singh in 1822, but the R\u00e1j\u00e1 was allowed to reside in his own territory in the enjoyment of a jagir, which is still held by the family. The present R\u00e1j\u00e1 is related by marriage to the Jammu royal family. Bhoti was a small State, ruled by a family of Surajbansi R\u00e1jputs which also still enjoys a small pension. Vide p. 133: the two States were distinct, and the families not related.\n\nBehandr\u00e1lta.\u2014The capital of this State was R\u00e1mnagar on the Tawi\u2014about 30 miles north-east of Jammu. The State was founded in the end of the 10th century by a brother of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Vichitar Varma of Chamba (A.D. 1000). Nothing is known of its subsequent history, and it was finally overthrown by R\u00e1j\u00e1 Gul\u00e1b Singh in 1821. The family resides at Sh\u00e1l\u00e1z\u00e1dpur in the Amb\u00e1l\u00e1 District.\n\nKashtw\u00e1r.\u2014The name of this State occurs as Kashtav\u00e1ta(2) in the R\u00e1j\u00e1 Tarangini, and in the 11th century it was subject to Kashmir. It was founded towards the middle of the 10th century by a R\u00e1jput adventurer from Gaur in Bengal. Kashtw\u00e1r, the capital, is on the Chec\u00e1b in the inner mountains to the east of Kashmir. In the time of Aurangzeb (A.D. 1687) the ruling R\u00e1j\u00e1 embraced Isl\u00e1m, and the family has ever since been Muhammadan. The State was for a short time subject to Chamba, and was annexed to Jammu in 1820-21, and the family now resides at Tilokpur in the Kangra District.\n\nThe three following States\u2014Basohli, Bhadu and Bhadraw\u00e1h\u2014were ruled by branches of the same family, an offshoot from the ruling family of Kulu, which came from Mayapuri (Hardw\u00e1r) and settled in Balaur:\n\nBasohli.\u2014The original capital was at Balaur (Skr. Vall\u00e1pura), 12 miles to the west of the R\u00e1vi from Basohli, where ancient remains are found. The State was probably of ancient origin, and may have been older than Chamba. Vall\u00e1pura(3) is several times referred to in the R\u00e1j\u00e1 Tarangini in the 11th century, and its R\u00e1j\u00e1s were then subject to Kashmir. The name of the State may then have been Sumata, and the people are referred to in a Chamba copper plate of the 11th century under the name of Saum\u00e1tika, as having joined with Durgara in an invasion of Chamba. It seems probable that Bhadu and Bhadraw\u00e1h were originally fiefs subject to Vallapura. Recently discovered inscriptions point to the Chur\u00e1h wiz\u00e1rat of Chamba having also been under Vall\u00e1pura previous to the 10th century; and for many centuries afterwards, down to quite modern times, it continued to be a constant bone of contention between the two States. Forster, the traveller, passed through Basohli in April 1783, and speaks of the country as still bearing evident traces of the devastation caused by such a border war in the previous year (vide p. 99 of Gazetter). The capital was removed to Basohli, on the right bank of the R\u00e1vi, in the 16th century. The country was annexed to Jammu in 1835, and, the last R\u00e1j\u00e1 dying childless, the family became extinct in the direct line.\n\n---\n\n(1) The States of Kahlur, N\u00e1l\u00e1g\u00e1th and Chaneni were all founded by branches of the same family.\n(2) R\u00e1j\u00e1 Tarangini (Stein), vii, 690.\n(3) Do., do., vii, 220, viii 537\u201442.\nBhadu.\u2014This is the Padoo of the maps and is situated to the south of Balaur. It was ruled by a branch of the Balauria family and seems to have become independent of Balaur in the latter half of the 11th century, and continued as a separate State till annexed by Jammu about 1840-41. The family now resides at Tilakpur in Kangra.\n\nBhadraw\u00e1h.\u2014According to the genealogical roll of the R\u00e1j\u00e1s this State was founded about the 15th century(1) by a scion of the Balauria family. It seems to have been more or less dependent on Balaur and Jammu, but later on came under the control of Chamba by which country it was annexed in 1821 under a sanad from Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 Ranjit Singh. It finally passed into the possession of Jammu in 1846. The ruling family has long been extinct in the direct line.\n\nThe whole of the Dugar States were subject to the Mughals from the time of Akbar till A.D. 1752, when they came under Dur\u00e1ni rule, and later on were subjected by the Sikhs.\n\nOn the conclusion of the First Sikh War a treaty was made between the British Government and the Sikh Darbar, at Lahore, on 9th March 1846, by which the Panjab Hills between the Satluj and the Indus were ceded to the British Government as part of the war indemnity. On the 11th March a supplementary treaty was agreed to, which bound the Government to respect the bon\u00e1 fide rights of the Hill chiefs within the ceded territories. The whole of the territories between the R\u00e1vi and the Indus in the Hills were thereafter on 16th March 1846, by the treaty of Amritsar, sold to Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 Gul\u00e1b Singh of Jammu, and the British Government, by the 38th Article of the treaty, imposed on the new ruler the obligations they had already come under as regards the rights of the Hill chiefs. In fulfilment of these obligations an agreement was made between Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 Gul\u00e1b Singh and the chiefs, under the guarantee of the British Government, by which cash allowances amounting to Rs. 62,800 per annum were assigned in perpetuity to the dispossessed chiefs of the outer hills between the R\u00e1vi and the Jhelum. They were at the same time given the option of remaining in or leaving Jammu territory, and most of them chose the latter alternative. The Government, therefore, became responsible for the payment of most of the annuities and to provide for these the districts of Suj\u00e1npur, part of Path\u00e1nkot, and certain lands between the Chakki and the Bi\u00e1s, belonging to Jammu and valued at Rs. 42,800 were ceded by Gul\u00e1b Singh to Government. The chiefs who elected to remain in Jammu territory receive their annuities direct from the Jammu State.(2)\n\n(1) The country is called Bhadraw\u00e1h Kh\u00e1s in the R\u00e1j\u00e1 Tarangini\n(2) Vide Treaties, Engagements and Sanads, No. CLXV.\nAPPENDIX VII.\n\nThe following list of altitudes above sea-level has been compiled partly from the maps of the Trigonometrical Survey and partly from local observations.
