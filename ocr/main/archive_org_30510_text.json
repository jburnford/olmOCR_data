under Sir William Meyer's scheme.\n\nChapter VII, page 120\u2014Lines under construction.\u2014The construction of the two branch lines, one from Bellary to Rayadurg and the other from Hospet to Kottur, was completed in 1905 and the lines were opened for traffic from 1st April 1905. They are of much service to the taluks of Rayadurg, Kudligi, Hadagalli and Harpanahalli.\n\nChapter X, page 147\u2014The Wardlaw College.\u2014The institution was reduced in 1908 from a Second-grade College to a High School.\n\nChapter X, page 148\u2014Lower Secondary schools.\u2014The management of the Lower Secondary School at Hospet has since been transferred from the Taluk Board to the Hospet Municipality. The management of the Harpanahalli Secondary School has lately been transferred from the Taluk to the District Board.\n\nChapter XI, page 176\u2014Existing Divisional charges.\u2014The constitution of a division at Rayadurg from 1st October 1910, increased the number of revenue divisions from three to four. The taluks comprised in the divisions are as shown below:\n\nAdoni division ... Adoni and Alur taluks.\nBellary ,, ... Bellary and Siruguppa taluks.\nHospet ,, ... Hospet, Harpanahalli and Hadagalli taluks.\nRayadurg ,, ...

Only the Tahsildars of Hadagalli, Harpanahalli and Rayadrug regularly exercise second-class magisterial powers, being assisted by their Taluk Sarishtadars. The criminal cases in the remaining six taluks and in the Bellary town are heard by Stationary Sub-Magistrates and the Sub-Magistrate, Bellary town. There is only one Deputy Tahsildar at Yemmiganur in Adoni exercising second-class powers within his jurisdiction. The four Divisional Magistrates and the District Magistrate have the usual first-class powers.\n\nChapter XIV, page 191\u2014The Local Boards.\u2014There are four taluk boards at Adoni, Bellary, Hospet and Rayadrug, the last having been formed on the 1st April 1911. The Taluk Boards manage the affairs of the taluks comprised in the revenue divisions of the same name.\n\nThe Unions.\u2014The conversion of Hospet Union into a Municipality reduced the number of unions from 19 to 18. The several unions comprised in the Taluk Boards are as shown below:\n\nAdoni Taluk Board. ... Alur, Holagondi, Kowtalam, Kosigi and Yemmiganur.\nBellary ,, ... Hirebal, Kudatin\u00ed, Siruguppa and Kuragodu.\nHospet ,, ... Harpanahalli, Hadagalli, Kamalapuram, Kampli and Narayandevarkeri.\nRayadrug ,, ... Rayadrug, Kudligi, Kanekal and Kottur.\n\nChapter XIV, page 192\u2014The two municipalities.\u2014Hospet was constituted a Municipality from 1st April 1913. The three municipal towns are Bellary, Adoni and Hospet.\n\nChapter XV, pages 211, 226, 234 and 235.\u2014The narrative portion of the notable places of Harivanam, Kenchanaguddam, Siruguppa and Tekkalakotta, which is now shown under Alur (211) and Bellary (226, 234 and 235) taluks, should be grouped separately under the Siruguppa taluk, as these villages have been included in that taluk.\n\nChapter XVI, page 316\u2014Administration. The present system.\u2014The present Raja of Sandur was installed in July 1913 and he thereafter took charge of the administration of the State. He is now assisted by a Diwan.\n\"A book that is shut is but a block\"\n\nCENTRAL ARCHAEOLOGICAL LIBRARY\n\nGOVT.
