In\nconsequence of the receipts having recently fallen off\nconsiderably, Sergeant Crane was communicated\nwith, and on the 18th December he re-\nsorted to the usual method of marking a quan-\ntity of half-crowns and florins. When Mr. Jack-\nson came down on the morning of the 19th, he,\nin Sergeant Crane's presence, called him into the\nprivate parlour and asked him to turn out the con-\ntents of his pockets. He produced altogether two\nhalf-crowns and two florins of the marked money,\nbut one of the latter being insufficiently marked, it\nwas not included in the indictment.\u2014For the de-\nfence the same plea was advanced by Mr. Geoghe-\ngan as that given by the prisoner when arrested\u2014\nthat, his employer having paid him his wages in\nsmall money on the previous day, he had simply ex-\nchanged the shillings for the larger pieces, as they\nwere more convenient.\u2014The jury, believing this to\nbe the case, returned a verdict of \"Acquittal.\"\n\nTHE ROBBERY AT APSLEY HOUSE.\u2014Alfred Sutton,\npainter, again surrendered to his bail, to answer an\nindictment charging him with having stolen a purse\ncontaining 10s., the property of Fanny Hartridge,\none of the housemaids at Apsley house, the town\nresidence of the Duke of Wellington.\u2014The prisoner,\nit will be remembered, was placed on his trial last\nsessions, and, after a prolonged hearing, the jury\nfailed to agree.
