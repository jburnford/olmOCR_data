DANIELLS.\u2014This bankrupt was described as a merchant, having formerly been in business as a perfumer, receiving about \u00a31,000 a year, and living like a gentleman. He disposed of his business for about \u00a31,500, and then entered very largely into railway speculations, being at one period worth about \u00a312,000, but his speculation resulted in a very heavy loss. This case was before the court a short time since, upon application for certificate, and it was adjourned till this day, for the purpose of investigation, and more particularly respecting the proof of Mr. More for \u00a3644 odd, being a balance of account resulting out of railway speculation. The bankrupt's debts and liabilities amount to about \u00a316,000, running over a period of about three years, and the assets appear on the balance-sheet to be \"property, \u00a3162 9s. 8d.\" He commenced with a capital of \u00a33,139 14s. 11d., and the losses and expenses amount to about \u00a310,000, the profits being stated at \u00a3285 6s. 6d. Mr. More, who opposed, had been in business as a spirit merchant in Liverpool, and in 1839 became bankrupt, but owing to some negligence on his own part he did not obtain his certificate until July, 1845, at which period he entered the Liverpool market as a share broker; and he did not know what was the amount of his debts, or the dividend, if any, paid under that bankruptcy. He was not a sworn broker. He had not offered to withdraw his opposition upon payment of \u00a3300.\u2014Mr. Lawrance, on behalf of the bankrupt, stated that the last item in the account between the bankrupt and Mr. More, upon which the proof of \u00a3644 odd, was now sought to be made, bore date the 11th of August. The certificate was dated the 25th of July, and twenty-one days was required for the certificate to remain at the Court of Review. Therefore the whole of these transactions upon which the proof was made, took place at a time when Mr. More was an uncertificated bankrupt. Under these circumstances he (Mr. Lawrance) must submit that Mr. More was not entitled to prove.\u2014After some further discussion the proof was admitted for the full amount claimed.\u2014Mr. Shultz, a stock-broker, stated that he had had transactions to the extent of thousands of pounds with various persons, and that the bankrupt was the most punctual of any.\u2014Upon the part of Mr. Ripley, a stock-broker, an adjournment of the case was prayed for. Mr. Ripley was a creditor for \u00a35,000, being the result of a loss upon Birmingham and Oxfordshire shares, occasioned by Emanuel Danielis, who, it was stated, had represented his employer to be a man of fortune, but had always refused to disclose his name. Upon going, however, to the office of the official assignee (Mr. Edwards), a bond of Lord Ventry's for \u00a37,000 being mentioned in the bankrupt's proceedings, and the same having been shown to Mr. Ripley, it was concluded that the bankrupt, being the brother of Emanuel Danielis, was his employer, and hence the attempt to prove against this estate. The bankrupt denied having employed his brother in any such transaction.\u2014Mr. Lawrance objected to an adjournment under such circumstances, and the court concurred.\u2014Mr. Bagley and Mr. Lawrance having been heard pro and con, his honour said that he did not consider that More stood in the position of a creditor entitled to much favour. The bankrupt had stated on a former occasion that More would be unable to prove himself a creditor against this estate, but it appeared to him (the commissioner) that he was a creditor. Upon the last occasion, also, the bankrupt stated that he had nothing to do with West Riding shares, but it appeared that he had, and he now sought to excuse himself by stating that he was merely an agent. The objection appeared to be, that the bankrupt had been trading out of his avocation as a trader; and it also appeared that he had been speculating in that which a trader ought not. In order to show traders that they were not to enter into illegitimate speculation, incurring losses, and then enter into one or two legitimate speculations, for the purpose of coming to this court and being made free of all the debts, the judgment of the court was that the certificate be suspended for twelve months, with protection from month to month.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3206190465.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 924, "total-output-tokens": 1023, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 4262, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
