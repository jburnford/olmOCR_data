The first issue of the calendar contained the names of 80 prisoners, 66 charged with felony and 14 with misdemeanour.\n\n**THE WATCH ROBBERY AT KING'S CROSS.**\u2014The first case taken was that of a prisoner named Robinson, who was tried at the last sessions on a charge of stealing a watch from the person of a man whose name to the jurors was unknown, near the Victoria hotel, King's cross. On that occasion the jury were discharged at midnight without a verdict, being unable to agree. The evidence given on that trial was again gone into, and two additional witnesses were examined whose evidence removed the doubt which existed on the former trial, and the prisoner was found \"Guilty.\"\u2014Lockyer and Houlsham, the prison officers, said the prisoner was known in the gaols, but they were not then prepared to state what he had been there for. Upon this sentence was respite till next session, to allow of inquiry being made.\n\n**THE JEWEL ROBBERY BY A YOUTH.**\u2014Wm. Giles, seventeen, a simple and inoffensive looking lad, was indicted for stealing 49 watches, 157 watch-guard chains, 65 ear-rings, 2 diamond crosses, 439 finger-rings, 204 brooches, 80 bracelets, 50 lockets, 300 shirt-studs, 12 sets of waistcoat buttons, 200 seals and charms, 189 breast pins, and 22l. in money, the goods, &c., of Herbert Henderson, his master, in his dwelling-house.\u2014He pleaded guilty.\u2014The prosecutor, a jeweller, in Regent-street and Piccadilly, stated, in answer to questions put by the court, that the prisoner had been errand boy in his service, and had provided himself with false keys, by means of which, on Sunday, the 16th of September, he got into the shop, during his master's absence, and packed up the property mentioned in the charge in two bags. The value of the whole was about 4,000l. The prisoner made off to France and procured at Calais a passport by which he proceeded to Paris. Information was forwarded to the Paris police, a clue having been obtained as to where the prisoner had started to, and he was found at the Hotel du Louvre, in possession of the greater portion of the stolen property. He was about leaving the hotel, with an interpreter, to dispose of some of the property, when the police caught him. While in Mr. Henderson's service he had 3s. a-week, with lodgings and part board. He was the son of a respectable man, by business a cheesemonger, somewhere at Hackney. It was not suggested that the prisoner had any accomplices in the robbery; it was all his own doing. Nearly the whole of the property had been recovered, but the prisoner had spent all the money he took with him.\u2014The assistant judge said the court felt great difficulty in dealing with the case. The prisoner was too old to be sent to a reformatory, and they felt that under all the circumstances, considering his age and character, they could consistently with their public duty refrain from passing a sentence of penal servitude. The learned judge then sentenced him to two years' hard labour, and hoped he would yet endeavour to make a good man of himself.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3206210019.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 878, "total-output-tokens": 765, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 3093, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
