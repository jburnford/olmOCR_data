Even first-class commercial bills can only be negotiated at full rates; and the bankers and bill brokers exercise considerable caution in the paper they receive. Taking into consideration, however, the healthy condition of trade, the absence of speculation, and the discrimination exhibited by all classes of the commercial community, there appears little ground for apprehension. The prevailing tightness is principally attributable to the instalments due this day and on Tuesday next upon the Turkish and English loans; but the manufacturers now require additional accommodation as preparations are making for the spring trade. It is not considered that the money market will manifest any decided symptoms of improvement until the commencement of 1856; and even then, owing to the anxiety which will be experienced until the contents of the budget are known, there may be no sensible relief.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3206312027.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 2074, "total-output-tokens": 256, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 1175, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
