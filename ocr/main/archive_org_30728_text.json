Its length from Kam\u00e1l on the west to Bar\u00fana on the east is 43 miles and its width from Damandar on the north to Bar\u00e1l on the south is 50 miles, as the crow flies. It is bounded on the north by the Simla Hill States of Balsan and Jubbal, on the east by the Tons river which divides it from the Dehra D\u00fan District of the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh, from which the Jumna also separates it on the south-east. On the south it borders on the State of Kalsia and the Ambala District of the Punjab. It is bounded on the west by Patiala territory, and on the north-west by Keonthal. Its area is 1,108 square miles, and its population in 1901 was 135,626 souls.\n\nThe whole territory of the State is, with the exception of the broad valley of the Ki\u00e1rda D\u00fan, mountainous, with deep valleys lying between ranges of varying elevation. Its main stream, the Giri, which enters the State at its northernmost point, runs at first from north-west to south-east, and for 25 miles forms the boundary between Sirmur and Keonthal. It then turns sharply to the south-east, and for a course of 55 miles divides the State into two almost equal portions, the Giri-w\u00e1r or cis-Giri country, south-west of the river, and the Giri-p\u00e1r or trans-Giri, north-east of it. The people of these two parts differ considerably in their characteristics.\n\nThe trans-Giri territory comprises the wild mountainous country which lies between the great range culminating in the Ch\u00far* peak and the Giri river. From this great peak, 11,982 feet in height, run two lofty ranges, one north-north-west, the Dh\u00e1r Japroi-Jadol, with its westerly spurs, the Dh\u00e1r Pain Kuffar and Dh\u00e1r Deothi: the other south-east, called the Dh\u00e1r Nohra, to Haripur Fort (8,802 feet), whence it divides into two ranges, of which one runs almost due east to the valley of the Tons. These ranges divide Sirmur from the State of Jubbal. From the Ch\u00far peak also run two other great spurs, north-west, the D\u00fadham Dh\u00e1r, and south-west, with many minor spurs springing from them, towards the Giri. From Haripur Fort the second range first runs southwards under the name of the Dh\u00e1r Nigali and then turns to the east under the name of Dh\u00e1r Kamrau. North of and parallel to this eastern spur runs the Dh\u00e1r Shillai, and between these hills lies the valley of the Neweli river, which falls into the Tons.\n\nThe cis-Giri country is intersected by three main ranges, all of which run from north-west to south-east. Of these the first is the Sain Dh\u00e1r or range which lies parallel to the Giri, and the\n\n* The native name is \"Ch\u00far ch\u00e1ndni ki dh\u00e1r\" (the hill of the silver bangle).\nsecond is the Dh\u00e1rthi or Little Range. Between these flows the Jal\u00e1l. The third is the low range which runs from near K\u00e1l\u00e1 Amb to the south of N\u00e1han and forms with the Dh\u00e1rthi an open valley through the western half of which flows the M\u00e1rkanda. Between the eastern extremities of this and the Dh\u00e1rthi ranges lies the wide open valley of the Ki\u00e1rda D\u00fan, whose eastern border is on the G\u00edri, the Jumna separating it from Dehra D\u00fan.\n\nThe Ki\u00e1rda D\u00fan itself may also be sub-divided into three distinct tracts:\u2014\n\n(i) the D\u00fan proper, which lies between the Jumna and the lower parts of the Dh\u00e1rthi range and Poka hills, and is partially watered by the G\u00edri and the B\u00e1t\u00e1 streams:\n\n(ii) the tract which comprises the N\u00e1li Khera and the adjacent hills of the lower Dh\u00e1rthi on the north of the B\u00e1t\u00e1, east of J\u00e1m\u00fan-Kh\u00e1la, west of tilla Ghar\u00edb N\u00e1th, and south of R\u00e1jban which indeed may be regarded as included in it, as it is a plain; in the north-east of this tract and on the south bank of the G\u00edri lies Sirm\u00far, the old capital of the State:\n\n(iii) the P\u00e1r-D\u00fani tract, which is surrounded by hills and lies near M\u00e1jra village. This is a natural fortress, only accessible by one road and now a deserted waste-forest\u2014though remains of wells show that it was once cultivated.\n\nA kh\u00f3l is a long, narrow valley. Its soil is usually stony and of inferior quality. But good pasture is abundant. The population is sparse and in Tahsil N\u00e1han chiefly consists of G\u00fajars, who rear numbers of cattle. In Tahsil Paunta the kh\u00f3ls are mostly inhabited by G\u00fajars, Banj\u00e1ras and Kanets. Wheat, barley, gram, cotton, maize, jwari and rice are grown in them, and gold is found in the sand of the streams. The chief kh\u00f3ls are:\u2014\n\n| N\u00e1han Tahsil | Paonta Tahsil |\n|--------------|--------------|\n| 1. Bhud.     | 1. Haripur.  |\n| 2. T\u00edlokpur. | 2. Nagli.    |\n| 3. Matar Beheron. | 3. Pahlori. |\n\nThe Ki\u00e1rda D\u00fan is watered by the B\u00e1t\u00e1 which rises nearest the Dh\u00e1r in the centre of the lower part of the Dh\u00e1rthi range and flows south-eastward, in the reverse direction, to the M\u00e1rkanda, until it falls into the Jumna at B\u00e1t\u00e1 Mandi. It is a perennial stream, subject to heavy floods in the rainy season, though usually fordable.\nBy far the greater portion of the State is drained by the Giri or its tributaries. None of these are important, except, on its right bank, the Jal\u00e1l, which joins it at Dad\u00e1hu below Satib\u00e1g\u00e1h at the south-eastern extremity of the Sain Dh\u00e1r. On its left bank the principal streams are the Lojla and Palor, which rise on the southern slopes of the Ch\u00fbr peak. The Giri is of varying width, in places 260 feet broad when in flood, but it is for the most part shallow and easily fordable, except in the rainy season. Its floods do great damage to the fields and houses along its banks, and it is useless for irrigation until it reaches the Ki\u00e1rd\u00e1 D\u00fan, but timber in considerable quantities is floated down it into the Jumna. Its water is reputed to cause indigestion, and to have an unpleasant odour. It falls into the Jumna below Mohkampur.\n\nThe Jal\u00e1l, which rises below Nahi in Tahs\u00edl Pachh\u00e1d, is a shallow stream of transparent water, rarely impassable even when in flood. Below Nahi, in the west, rises the Kawal, a stream which first flows westward, till it reaches the Pati\u00e1la border, and thence turns north till it falls into the Giri.\n\nThe Tons forms the eastern boundary of the State from Koti, on the Jubbal border, southward for some 30 miles, dividing the State from Jauns\u00e1r.\n\nIn the east of the Dh\u00e1r Nig\u00e1li rise two streams which flow into the Tons. These are the Bangal, which drains the north-eastern corner of the State, south of Jubbal, and the Neweli, already mentioned. In the south-west corner besides the M\u00e1rkanda three seasonal torrents rise in the hills near Madhan Kid\u00e1r and combine midway between P\u00e1pri and Bhojpur to form the R\u00fan, which flows southwards from the Dh\u00e1rthi Dh\u00e1r into the Amb\u00e1la District.\n\nThe M\u00e1rkanda, rising below the temple of Devi Kat\u00e1san at Bar\u00e1ban, flows westward and waters the village gardens at M\u00e1luw\u00e1la; below M\u00e1luw\u00e1la it turns south-west and waters the lands of Sambhuv\u00e1la and Rukheri and the garden of Bir Bikram\u00e1b\u00e1d, after which it enters the Amb\u00e1la District near K\u00e1l\u00e1 Amb. It is a sluggish, perennial stream, shallow and always fordable. Its only tributary of any importance is the Sail\u00e1ni.\n\nRegarding the geology of the State, Mr. H. H. Hayden writes as follows:\n\n\"The greater part of the Sirm\u00far State lies on rocks of tertiary age, with beds belonging to the carbonaceous system (Krol and Blaini groups) on the north-east. The lower tertiary rocks are particularly well developed, and the Sirm\u00far series, which includes the Sub\u00e1thu, Dagsh\u00e1i and Kasauli groups, takes its name from the State. The upper tertiary, or Siw\u00e1lik, series is largely developed in the neighbourhood of N\u00e1han, where the lower beds consist of great mass of sandstones, the N\u00e1han group; these are\noverlain by sandstones and conglomerates (middle and upper Siwalik) containing a rich mammalian fauna of pliocene age.\"\n\nThis system is more fully described in the Manual of the Geology of India as follows:\n\nIn the neighbourhood of Nahan this system was originally divided into two members; a lower, to which the name of Nahan was applied, and an upper, to which the name of Siwalik was restricted. In this area the boundary between the two groups is a great fault, but there must be a real, if local, unconformity, for the upper Siwalik conglomerates contain numerous pebbles of the Nahan sandstones they are faulted into contact with. The distinction between the Nahan and Siwalik zones appears to be well maintained in a south-easterly direction as far as the borders of Nepal, but to the north-west it disappears, and there appears to have been a continuous series of deposits, ranging from the bottom to the top of the upper tertiary formations. No fossils have yet been found in the typical Nahan, though it would appear that they do occur, but to the north-west representatives of the Siwalik fauna occur low down in the series, in beds, which very possibly represent the Nahan group as originally defined. Under these circumstances it has been found inadvisable to retain the separation between Nahan and Siwalik, and the former are now classed as lower Siwalik, though the term may be retained as a useful local designation for a particular type of formation.\n\nThe Nahan group is composed of alternating beds of a fine grained, usually grey, firm sandstone, and of clays, usually bright and red in colour, and almost always some shade of red or purple which weather in a nodular manner. The clays usually prevail in the lower part of the group and the sandstones in the upper.\n\nThe lithology of this group resembles very closely that of the Dagshai group, and one might be tempted to regard them as equivalent to each other. The equivalence cannot be absolutely disproved till the area west of the termination of the typical lower Himalayas, in the Kangra Valley and the Jammu Hills, has been examined in greater detail than has yet been done, but in the meanwhile there are good reasons for supposing that the lithological similarity between the two groups is due to a similarity in their condition of deposition, and does not mean contemporaneity of origin.\n\nIn the first place the two groups are found in distinct areas, separated by a marked structural feature, exhibiting itself at the present day as a fault of many thousand feet throw. This fault\u2014commonly known as the main boundary\u2014is connected in a peculiar manner with the elevation of the Himalayas, and it is highly improbable that the beds exposed south of it are of the same age as those found to the north. Another argument depends on the fact that no exposure of the Subathu group has been found even in the deepest cut sections of the typical Nahan group, and a third may be derived from the smaller degree of induration, indicating, though not proving, a younger age. In the country north of Nahan town, where the Nahan and Dagshai groups are brought into contact with each other, on opposite sides of the main boundary fault, the sandstones of the former always weather into soft rounded lumps, while the Dagshai sandstones weather into angular fragments, which have lost the sharpness of their angles, but exhibit a much less degree of weathering than that which the Nahan beds have undergone.\n\nFinally, the red clay beds which have already been mentioned as occurring at the top of the Kasauli group, though they differ somewhat from the typical Nahan clays, resemble them sufficiently to point to a return of the conditions of deposition which prevailed in the Dagshai and Nahan periods, and suggest that on an unbroken section the Nahan would be found to overlie the Kasauli group.\n\nNo fossils have been described from the typical Nahans. It is possible that some of the lower Siwalik fossils found in the North-West Punjab may have been derived from beds of the same age, but the supposition lacks proof. There seems, however, to be little room for doubt that Sir Proby Cautley did find fossils on the northern side of the hill on which the town of Nahan stands, and consequently in the beds of the Nahan group, but the specimens were lost before they had been examined by a paleontologist.\n\nThe Sirmur State possesses a variety of vegetation in which both tropical and temperate species are represented, but in these brief notes it is impossible to do more than give an outline of its salient points. As the climate of Sirmur derives its character from different elevations, so its flora varies with the conditions of the locality under which the various species thrive. That of the Kiarda and Bijara Duns, the Siwaliks and other low hills is\n\n---\n\n1Second Edition, page 356.\n2H. B. Medlicott, Memoirs, III, Part I, pages 17, 101 (1864).\n3H. B.

Medlicott, Memoirs, III, Part II, page 16 (1864); Records, XIV, 71, footnote (1864).\nvery similar to the flora of the Dehra D\u00fan and Sah\u00e1r\u00e1npur Siw\u00e1liks, while that of the mountains or temperate zone resembles that of Jaunsar and Simla.\n\nConsidering the small area of the State, it is comparatively rich in vegetation. Of that of the tropical zone, more than forty-four natural orders are represented, and these embrace many species (vide appendix). Of these eighty are trees, the smallest of which attain a height of thirty feet, while *Anogeissus latifolia*, *Bombax malabaricum*, *Ficus religiosa*, *F. bengalensis*, *Terminalia belerica*, and *Terminalia chebula* reach a height of a hundred feet and have massive crowns. The *Shorea robusta* (s\u00e1l) and *Terminalia tomentosa* (sain) are the most valuable trees, but do not grow so large as those east of the Jumna. The s\u00e1l, with occasional admixture of sain, form close forest clothing the greater part of the D\u00fans, while on the slopes to the west of N\u00e1ban, in parts of the Siw\u00e1liks and on the lower terraces of the hills north of the D\u00fan as far the Tons, the s\u00e1l extends into a forest of mixed species. Next in importance to the above are:\u2014the *Dalbergia sissoo*, found always on alluvial deposits near rivers and streams, but of small height and girth; the *Bouchinia retusa*, only found in a few places and valuable for its gum, known as *semia* or *chakera*: the *Cedrela toona*, *Ougenia dalbergioides*, the timber of which is considered good for agricultural implements, though it is a small stunted tree, and the *Pinus longifolia*, which finds its lower limit in the Siw\u00e1liks, but the trees are more or less stunted and of small girth.\n\nBy far the greater part of the State area is covered with forests of mixed, and for the most part inferior, species called locally *kok\u00e1t* forests, which contain, so far as has been observed, one hundred species of trees and shrubs (vide list). Many are of economic value, yielding gums, dyes, medicines, edible fruits, and nearly all are utilized for timber, fuel, or fodder. These are described in Brandis\u2019 \u201cForest Flora\u201d\u00b9 and their products in Dr. Watt\u2019s \u201cEconomic Products.\u201d Bamboo (*Dendrocalamus strictus*) occupies areas of the southern slopes varying from seven to eight hundred acres. Near R\u00e1jpur are a few rattan cane brakes which, if extended, would support a small industry.\n\nAmong the shrubs the following may be mentioned as of economic value:\u2014*Woodfordia floribunda*, *Adhetoda vasica*, *Carissa carandas*, *Carissa diffusa*, *Zizyphus vulgaris*, *Zizyphus oxyphylla*, *Zizyphus jujuba*, *Zizyphus nummularia*, *C\u00e6salpinia indigofera*, *Abrus precatorius* (a climber), *Bauhinia vahlii*, *Rubus flavus*, *Prinsepia utilis*, *Rubus lasiocarpus*, *Combretum decandrum*, *Myrsine semiserrata*, *Nerium odorum*, *Cryptolepis buchanani*, *Cordia myxa*, *Myrsine Africana*, *Tecoma undulata*, *Euphorbia royleana*, *Agave Americana*, *Putranjiva*, *Mimosa rubicaulis*.\n\n\u00b9 And Stewart\u2019s Punjab Plants.\nHerbaceous plants, wild flowers, ferns, lichens, orchids and algae abound. A valuable grass (thabber) (*Andropogon involutus*) covers many southern slopes, and is largely used for ropes and paper making.\n\nThe fruit trees found growing at low elevations are the mango, custard apple (*sharifa*), orange, lemon, citron, pomegranate, peach, plantain, plum, grape, *lich\u00e9*, loquat, walnut and guava. The sweet chestnut has been planted in some gardens, but the trees have not yet borne fruit.\n\nIn the temperate part of Sirmur, so far as has been observed, the flora consists of fifty species, more or less. Among the trees the deodar stands first as producing the most lasting timber for buildings and railway sleepers, etc. The Blue Pine (*P. excelsa*) and *chil* (*P. longifolia*) come next, and lastly, the oaks, which yield inferior timber, charcoal, fuel and fodder. The firs (*Abies Smithiana* and *Webbiana*) occupy the highest elevations, but at present have no market value. They form in some places fairly dense forests in which trees twelve feet in girth and a hundred and forty feet high are plentiful. The yew, maple, elm, and birch are found in considerable numbers.\n\nThe shrubs are numerous (*vide list*) and on the higher slopes there is a large variety of wild flowers, ferns, and lichens. Near villages and cultivation the apricot, peach, pomegranate, *kaifal* (*Myrica sapidda*), raspberry, wild cherry, wild pear, and walnut all grow wild. A small wild strawberry grows on some of the upper slopes. Rhubarb grows wild.\\(^1\\)\n\nPerhaps no State in the Punjab contains such a variety of fauna, due chiefly to the different climates found in the tropical D\u00fcn, the Siwaliks and other hills, long river basins, and sub-Alpine heights. Other favouring causes are the comparatively large extent covered by forest and the measures for the protection of game taken by the Forest Department.\n\nNot many years ago elephants and tigers were plentiful in the D\u00fcn, and the former were sometimes captured. Both animals have now, however, decreased sadly in numbers, though a few elephants occasionally visit the D\u00fcn for brief periods. Tigers remain longer, in fact are never absent, but they have a wider range than the Sirmur D\u00fana and low hills for their hunting grounds, and hence their depredations are not much felt.\n\nThe leopard, or panther is common and is known under various names, as *b\u00e1gh*, *baghera*, and *annith*. Other carnivora are the hyena, jackal, wild dog, leopard, cat, the yellow jungle cat, and fox. The *s\u00e1mbar*, *chital*, hog-deer, *chau-*\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) For a complete list of the flora of the State see Appendix XV.\nSirmur State.] Climate. [Part A.\n\nsingha, barking-deer, ghural, and pig are all found in the tropical tracts. The sambhar prefers the low hills, the chital the sal forests of the D\u00fcn, and the chausingsha its open grassy lands and glades. The barking-deer (kakar) keeps to the forests on the hills and the ghural to the precipices. The former is also found at higher elevations. The black bear wanders from the higher forests to the lower ones, where he remains during the winter. Hares, jungle-fowl, pea-fowl, partridges, and bush-quail are plentiful in parts of the D\u00fcn and low hills; and the kalej pheasant (kolsar) is found here and there on the low hill slopes. Serow and musk deer (kastura) are found on the higher hills. The mun\u00e1l (also called ratnal), kokt\u00e1s and cheer pheasants are common in suitable localities.\n\nThe rivers contain many kinds of fish, the most important being the mahser, guje, sayol, launchi, daulah and g\u00fainch.\n\nThe climate of the State varies according to its elevation. That of Nahan Tahsil is fairly good, but that of the D\u00fcn during the rainy season and the autumn is bad, and malarial fever is prevalent. Tahsils Raink\u00e1 and Pachh\u00e1d and the upper part of P\u00e1onta are healthy. The water in these places is popularly supposed to possess digestive properties. In the D\u00fcn the summer months are exceedingly hot and water is scarce, but the hill il\u00e1g\u00e1s have a temperate climate, though the Dh\u00e1rthi also is hot. Panjhota, Sain and the trans-Giri country are cool even in the hot weather. Trans-Giri snow falls every year, and occasionally in Sain, while in the Dh\u00e1rthi it falls rarely. In 1901 and 1905 all the higher peaks of the Dh\u00e1rthi were covered with snow. The snowfall on the Chaur peak is heavy from January to March and frequently in April. The zamind\u00e1rs dread the fall of snow in December, but snow after December is looked upon as beneficial, and the cultivators say it is as good as manure.\n\nThe marginal statement gives the average rainfall for the ten years 1892\u20141902. Cis-Giri the rains last from June to September, and trans-Giri rain falls in April also. In the cold weather rain falls from December to February. Trans-Giri the rainfall is heavier than it is cis-Giri.\n\nThere are very few wells in Sirmur and hardly any tanks in the high hills. The only lake in the State is at Raink\u00e1. Drinking water is obtained from natural streams and springs, and the supply is often deficient in the lower ranges, even Nahan itself being insufficiently supplied with water during the hot weather.\nSection B.\u2014History.\n\nThe early history of Sirmur is mingled with legend. In 1139 Sambat, Madan Singh, a S\u00farajbansi R\u00e1jp\u00fat, was King of Sirmur, now a ruined village in Paunta Tahsil, on the Giri. Sirmur was his capital, and the kingdom was known as Sirmur or Silm\u00far after it. During Madan Singh\u2019s reign\u00b9 a woman, expert in necromancy, presented herself before the R\u00e1ja and boasted of her skill. He showed himself sceptical of her powers and challenged her to cross the Giri between the Toka and Poka ranges by means of an acrobat\u2019s rope, called bharat in the tumbler\u2019s language, promising her half his kingdom if she crossed the river and returned by this means. She succeeded in crossing, and was returning on the rope when one of the R\u00e1ja\u2019s officials treacherously cut the rope to prevent her claiming half the kingdom, and the woman fell into the river and was drowned. This act of treachery resulted in a flood which swept away the town, and the R\u00e1ja with all his kin perished. The country was thus left without a ruler.\n\nIn Sambat 1152 Ugar Sain, R\u00e1wal, of Jaisalmer, visited Hardw\u00e1r, and there met Hoshang Rai N\u00e1th, a Bh\u00e1t or Badfarosh by caste, of Sirmur, who sang his praises and invited him to assume the sovereignty of the kingdom. The R\u00e1wal sent a force under his son Sobha R\u00e1wal to conquer Sirmur. Sobha subdued the country, and made R\u00e1jban his capital,\u00b2 taking the title of Subhans Park\u00e1sh. His rule lasted only four years, and he died in Sambat 1156. His successors are shown in the following list:\n\n\u00b9On 27th Ph\u00e1g\u00e1n, 1152 Sambat.\n\n\u00b2On 27th Ph\u00e1g\u00e1n, 1152 Sambat.\n\nThe Jubbal State history gives a different version of this legend, and says that the name of the last of the old rulers of Sirmur was Ugar Singh, not Madan Singh.\n| Sambat | Name of R\u00e1j\u00e1 | A.

This admission of subjection was resisted and the forces of both States met on the Besu Dhar. Sirmur was defeated, but aided by his father-in-law, the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Goler, Mah\u00ed Park\u00e1sh attacked H\u00e1t Koti whereupon R\u00e9p Chand was defeated and his son gave him his sister in marriage.\n\nThe chronology of the R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Sirmur offers a few difficulties. It is drawn from two sources\u2014one a list of the R\u00e1j\u00e1s kept in the State archives, the other a list in the custody of the mahant of Jagannath, at N\u00e1han. The former list shows the dates of each R\u00e1j\u00e1's accession and death; the latter only the length of his reign. The few discrepancies are most marked in the first few reigns (1099\u20131127), and for the period 1127\u20131283 the two lists are in strict accord with one or two exceptions. But with the reign of Bahhat Park\u00e1sh a period of confusion begins. The mahant's list omits Bhupat Park\u00e1sh but makes Bahhat's reign 32 years instead of 22, making the total number of years from Bahhat's accession to Ude Chand's demise 33, as in the state list. From 1616 to 1754 both lists give a total of 138 years, but there are numerous discrepancies in the lists of the R\u00e1j\u00e1s, and, even when the names agree, in the length of the reigns. These probably point to dynastic troubles or interference in the succession on the part of the Mughal Emperors to which the State chronicles do not allude. Lastly, there is a discrepancy in the reign of Karm Park\u00e1sh who abdicated in 1815.\nThe earliest mention of Sirmur by the Muhammadan historians occurs in the Tabaqat-i-Nasiri under the year 634 H., when the Nizam-ul-Mulk, Muhammad Junaidi, who had rebelled against the Sultan Raziyyat, the daughter of Altamas, took refuge in the hills of Sirmur-Bardar, where he died.\n\nThe chronicles of the State do not mention the events of 655 H. when Qutlugh Khan in his retreat from Hindustan to Lahore sought a refuge in Santur-garh and the Hindu Chiefs afforded him an asylum. Thereupon Mahmud Shah I attacked Santur, and Ulugh Khan-i-Azam penetrated as far as the fort and territory of Silmurr and devastated the Koh-i-Silmurr or hill tract of Sirmur. The fort and territory of Sirmur were then apparently in possession of that great Rai, Ranu Ranpal of Santur, and he fled before the Muhammadans who plundered the marketplace and town of Silmurr. The historian observes that before this time no Muhammadan army had ever penetrated this territory.\n\nIn the year 781 H., the Sultan Firoz Shah III made a progress through Ambala and entered the hills of Saharanpur. After taking tribute from the Raids of Sirmur and the other Hill States he returned to Delhi.\n\nThe next event of importance was the invasion of Taimur. In his autobiography Taimur says: \"On the 14th of Jamadi-ul-Awal I crossed the Jumna with the baggage and encamped in another part of the Siwalik hills. Here I learnt that in this part of the Siwalik there was a raja, of great rank and power, by name Ratn Sen.\" A road had to be cleared through the jungle, and on the 15th of the month Taimur found himself between two mountains,\u2014one the Siwalik, the other the Koka mountain. \"The hills on both sides raised their heads to the clouds. In the front of this valley Raja Ratn Sen had drawn out his forces as numerous as ants or locusts.\" But the Hindus broke and fled at the first onset, many being killed in the pursuit, and the victors obtained a great booty.\n\nCunningham identifies Ratn Sen of this account with Raja Ratn Parkash, who reigned from 1460 to 1490, but Taimur invaded India in 1398-99. The chronological difficulty appears insoluble, but it is certain from Taimur's account that he invaded the Kiarda Dun.\n\nThe Raja Malhi Parkash was a good ruler, religious and charitable. He wrested the fort of Malda from the Raja of Srinagar in Garhwal. Raja Udit Parkash removed his capital from Rajban to Kalsi in Dehra Dun, and abdicated his throne in favour of his son. Raja Somer Parkash captured the fort of\n\n---\n\n1 Bardar is probably Bhadra Tibba in Saharanpur.\n2 The ruins of Santur or Santaur lie at a place called Sindhupand, near Chhachhrauli, the capital of the modern State of Kalsia in the Ambala District.\n3 T. N., pages 706 and 839-40.\n4 R. H. I., iv, page 14.\nRatesh, now in Keonthal, and made it his capital, but S\u00faraj Park\u00e1sh returned to Kalsi, whereupon his subjects rose in revolt and attacked his palace, which was vigorously defended by his daughter, who fell in the struggle. Upon this S\u00faraj Park\u00e1sh hastened from Kalsi and subdued the rebels, and also overcame the Th\u00e1kars of Jubbal, Balsan, Kumh\u00e1rsain, Ghond, Sahri, Theog, Raw\u00e1in and Ketgur\u00fa, making them pay tribute, and appointing his brother Kaly\u00e1n Chand to their charge. Kalsi continued to be the capital of the State. R\u00e1j\u00e1 B\u00edf S\u00e1l Park\u00e1sh abdicated the throne in order to devote himself to a religious life. Under R\u00e1j\u00e1 Jagat Park\u00e1sh the Th\u00e1kars of Jubbal, Balsan, Kumh\u00e1rsain, Sahri, Raw\u00e1in and other chiefs revolted, owing to the R\u00e1j\u00e1\u2019s mal-administration, but B\u00edf Park\u00e1sh, an energetic ruler, reduced them to obedience, and built the fort of H\u00e1th-Koti on the boundary of Sahri, Raw\u00e1in and Jubbal. Nakat Park\u00e1sh made Neri his capital, but Garbh Park\u00e1sh resided in H\u00e1th-Koti. After him Brahm Park\u00e1sh made Kot and Garjari in Ratesh pargana the seats of government, and they so continued until Bubbal Park\u00e1sh removed to Kalsi. Karam Park\u00e1sh founded N\u00e1han in 1678 Sambat. This valiant chief became the spiritual disciple of B\u00e1wa Banw\u00e1ri D\u00e1s, whose descendants still hold the temple of Jagann\u00e1th at N\u00e1han. In the 8th year of the reign of Shah Jah\u00e1n, Nij\u00e1bat Kh\u00e1n, faujdar of the country at the foot of the Kangra hills, offered to conquer Srinagar, in Garhw\u00e1l, and asked for 2,000 horse to effect this object. These the emperor gave him, and accompanied by the army of the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Sirm\u00far, Nij\u00e1bat Kh\u00e1n marched on Srinagar. On the way he took the fort of Shergarh which had been erected by the Zamind\u00e1r of Srinagar on the bank of the Jumna in his own territory. He also took the fort of Kalsi and made it over to the Zamind\u00e1r of Sirm\u00far, its rightful owner, who complained that the fort of Bair\u00e1t had also been wrested from him by the Zamind\u00e1r of Srinagar, and declared that if a force were given him he could recover it. Troops were accordingly given him, and the fort was taken and made over to him. Nij\u00e1bat Kh\u00e1n then marched on, took Sant\u00far and entrusted it to Jagtu, the Zamind\u00e1r of Lakhapur with 100 horse and 1,000 foot.\n\nNij\u00e1bat Kh\u00e1n\u2019s troops met with disaster in his invasion of Garhw\u00e1l. He lost his mansab and j\u00e1gir, which were bestowed upon Mirza Kh\u00e1n, son of Shah Naw\u00e1z Kh\u00e1n and grandson of Abd-ur-rahim Kh\u00e1n, Kh\u00e1n Kh\u00e1n\u00e1n, who became faujdar in his stead.\n\n---\n\n1 The Raj\u00e1 of Garhw\u00e1l. The hill chiefs were ordinarily styled Zamind\u00e1rs by the Mughal emperors. But the rulers of Sirm\u00far have always been addressed as R\u00e1j\u00e1s.\n\n2 Kalpi or K\u00e1lsi.\nR\u00e1j\u00e1 Mandh\u00e1ta was a contemporary of the emperor Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n, who by a firm\u00e1n, dated 23rd Jam\u00e1d-us-S\u00e1n\u00ed, 1064 H., advised the R\u00e1j\u00e1 that he had deputed Iraj Kh\u00e1n, fowjd\u00e1r of Jammu and K\u00e1agra, to conquer Sr\u00ednagar in Garhw\u00e1l, and invited the R\u00e1j\u00e1 and the Zamind\u00e1rs of the hills to assist, promising that the adjacent territories of Kamaun should be conferred upon the Zamind\u00e1rs of that country, and those adjacent to his own dominions upon the R\u00e1j\u00e1 in addition to his own possessions, while the Dehra D\u00fan was to be added to the imperial dominions. By a second firm\u00e1n, dated the 24th Moharram 1065 H., Khalil-ull\u00e1h Kh\u00e1n was nominated commander, vice Bair\u00e1m Kh\u00e1n, 10,000 troops being placed under his command. Sr\u00ednagar was conquered in the reign of Subh\u00e1g Park\u00e1sh, who, in recognition of his services, received a firm\u00e1n, dated the 11th of Rabi-us-S\u00e1n\u00ed, 1065 H., confirming the promised grant of territory and granting the R\u00e1j\u00e1 whatsoever Khalil-ull\u00e1h might propose in his favour. In consequence by an imperial firm\u00e1n, dated the 22nd of Jam\u00e1d-ul-Awal, 1065 H., the R\u00e1j\u00e1 was granted the ul\u00e1qa of Kot\u00e1ha, and the R\u00e1j\u00e1 accordingly expelled the Zamind\u00e1r of Kot\u00e1ha and annexed that territory. Before his accession in 1068 H., Alang\u00edr sent the R\u00e1j\u00e1 a firm\u00e1n, through Prince Muhammad Sult\u00e1n, to notify his resumption of power. This firm\u00e1n bears the seal of Alamg\u00edr as prince, not as emperor.\n\nIn 1069 H., Alamg\u00edr sent a second firm\u00e1n calling upon the R\u00e1j\u00e1 to prevent and intercept all correspondence between Sulaim\u00e1n Shikoh, then at Sr\u00ednagar, and his father, D\u00e1ra Shikoh, passing through the State. This firm\u00e1n also conveys news of the defeat of Shuja, and states that Sult\u00e1n Muhammad, through whom it was sent, had been despatched in pursuit. Another firm\u00e1n of this year reiterates the request that the guards placed to prevent the correspondence in question should be carefully supervised, and states that R\u00e1j\u00e1 R\u00e1j R\u00fap had been deputed to chastise the Zamind\u00e1r of Sr\u00ednagar, and that the R\u00e1j\u00e1 should assist in the extirpation of his enemy, the Zamind\u00e1r. A further firm\u00e1n informs the R\u00e1j\u00e1 that R\u00e1j\u00e1 R\u00e1j R\u00fap would attack Sr\u00ednagar from one side, and Ra'ad Kh\u00e1n from the other, and that the R\u00e1j\u00e1 should cooperate with the latter.\n\nThis R\u00e1j\u00e1, Subh\u00e1g Park\u00e1sh, was a good administrator, and improved and encouraged agriculture. This led the emperor\n\n---\n\n1Khalil-ull\u00e1h's campaign occurred in 1065 H., according to the Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n-n\u00e1ma, which adds that the Zamind\u00e1r of Sirmur had never before allied himself with the Delhi empire, and that on his joining the imperial forces he was distinguished by the issue of an edict conferring on him the title of Subh\u00e1g (Sabh\u00e1k) Park\u00e1sh. The campaign is fully described in the Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n-n\u00e1ma, E. H. I., vil, pages 106-07.\n\n2Uncle of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Jaswant Singh of Jodhpur.\n\n3The firm\u00e1ns of Alamg\u00edr address the R\u00e1j\u00e1 by the title of Qudwat-ul-Ims\u00e1il, thus showing that he ranked higher than R\u00e1j\u00e1 R\u00e1j R\u00fap, who is addressed as Zubdat-ul-Ims\u00e1il.\nAlamgir to confer upon him in the third year of his reign the il\u00e1qa of Kal\u00e1kh\u00e1r by firm\u00e1n, on the ground that its Zam\u00ednd\u00e1rs had mismanaged it. This would seem to be the modern il\u00e1qa of Kola-gadh, which lies near Dehra D\u00fan, and is still held by the State in proprietorship.\n\nR\u00e1j\u00e1 Subh\u00e1g Park\u00e1sh left two sons, Beh\u00e1ri Mal and Hari Singh, of whom the former succeeded him under the title of Budh or Bidhi Chand Park\u00e1sh, receiving a firm\u00e1n, dated 10th Safar in the 10th year of the reign of Alamgir (1075 H.), in which that emperor recognised his succession. By a firm\u00e1n, dated 11th Zulhij in the 16th year of his reign (1084 H.), the emperor asked him to permit a contractor to take s\u00e1l timber from the Kal\u00e1kh\u00e1r forest free of charge and to refund to him any dues which had been levied. Timber worth Rs. 8,000 was, in consequence, taken for imperial use.\n\nBy a firm\u00e1n, dated the last day of Safar in the 17th year of Alamgir's reign (1085 H.), the R\u00e1j\u00e1 was required to expel S\u00faraj Chand, a son of the late Zam\u00ednd\u00e1r who had usurped the Pinjaur pargana which formed part of the estate of Naw\u00e1b Fida Kh\u00e1n, the emperor's foster-brother. This firm\u00e1n was duly executed by the R\u00e1j\u00e1, who took possession of Pinjaur, Sah-w\u00e1na, and the forts of Jagatgarh and Muzaffargarh, now in the Amb\u00e1la District. The firm\u00e1ns addressed to S\u00faraj Chand appear to have been taken in these operations, for they are preserved in the State archives. In 1093 H. the R\u00e1j\u00e1 represented to the Emperor that the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Sr\u00ednagar had seized some of his parganas, and the Emperor accordingly despatched a force to aid him in recovering them. In consequence, the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Sr\u00ednagar surrendered the fort of Bairath Kalsi to R\u00e1j\u00e1 Budh Park\u00e1sh. In 1100 H., the R\u00e1j\u00e1 received a firm\u00e1n acknowledging his letter of thanks and directing him not to interfere with the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Sr\u00ednagar in future. The R\u00e1j\u00e1 also carried on a curiously interesting correspondence with the Begam Jah\u00e1n Ara to whom he used to send musk, wild pomegranates and game, receiving valuable khillats in return. The Begam's fondness for jungle-fowl and pheasant is expressed in her letters. Ice or snow was also sent to her, being stored at the foot of the hills in ice-pits, and thence sent to Delhi in the hot weather. The Begam once complains of its bad quality, and in reply is told by the R\u00e1j\u00e1 that her darogh\u00e1 (steward) is careless and omits to pay the labourers honestly, whereupon the Begam warns the darogh\u00e1.\n\nJog R\u00e1j, son of Budh Park\u00e1sh, succeeded Bidhi Chand under the title of Mat or Medni Park\u00e1sh, receiving recognition and\n\n---\n\n1For a Fidal Khan, see E.

There it was packed in boxes and sent in rafts to Dary\u00e1pur in pargana Khizr\u00e1b\u00e1d, and thence again in boats to Delhi. The journey from Dary\u00e1pur to the capital occupied three days. E. H. I., vii, page 106.\na khillat from the Emperor. In his reign Gur\u00fa Govind Singh came to Paunta in this State, and made it his residence.\n\nThe Gur\u00fa resided in Anandpur, then in the Kahl\u00far State, but on refusing to surrender an elephant to R\u00e1j\u00e1s Bh\u00edm Chand and Hari Chand of Bil\u00e1spur he was compelled by them to quit that place and went to Toka. Thence he was brought to N\u00e1han by the R\u00e1j\u00e1, Mat Park\u00e1sh, and from there he proceeded to Paunta. Meanwhile the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Kahl\u00far had gone to Sr\u00ednagar to celebrate the marriage of his son with the daughter of Fateh Sh\u00e1h, R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Sr\u00ednagar, and found that the Gur\u00fa had sent wedding presents to R\u00e1j\u00e1 Fateh Sh\u00e1h. These presents he compelled the latter to return as the Gur\u00fa was his enemy. Upon this the Gur\u00fa made ready for war, and Hari Chand, with Fateh Sh\u00e1h, advanced to attack him. The opposing forces met at Bhangani on the Jumna, and the Gur\u00fa was completely victorious, both Fateh Sh\u00e1h and Hari Chand being slain\u2014the latter, it is said, by an arrow from the Gur\u00fa's own bow. The R\u00e1n\u00eds of both the fallen leaders became sat\u00ed, and their eight tombs are still shown at Bhangani. The Gur\u00fa pitched his flag of victory here also, and a Gur\u00fadaw\u00e1ra still marks the spot. Mat Park\u00e1sh died childless in 1761 Sambat. Hari Park\u00e1sh, the second son of Budh Park\u00e1sh, now ascended the throne, being recognised by the firm\u00e1n of Alamg\u00edr, dated the 2nd of Rabi-ul-Akhir, 1115 H. His reign of only eight years ended in 1769 Sambat, and he was succeeded by his son Bije Park\u00e1sh\u2014a title which he chose in preference to that of Bh\u00edm Park\u00e1sh, suggested to him by the Emperor Bah\u00e1dur Shah. He was succeeded, in 1793 Sambat, by Part\u00edp Park\u00e1sh, whose weak rule caused his feudatories to rebel. His eldest son and successor, Kir\u00e1t Park\u00e1sh, effected great reforms. He was victorious over the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Sr\u00ednagar, and after routing him turned his arms against the Sikhs, taking Nar\u00e1ingarh, R\u00e1m-pur, Th\u00e1nad\u00e1ra, R\u00e1mgarh, Morni, Pinjaur and Jagatgarh. Having consolidated his power and secured internal peace, he entered into an alliance with R\u00e1j\u00e1 Amar Singh of Pati\u00e1la, and recovered Saif\u00e1b\u00e1d for that ruler when it had been lost to him in the rebellion headed by his was\u00edr, Ganga R\u00e1m. Again, when Ghul\u00e1m Q\u00e1dir Kh\u00e1n, Rohilla, invaded Kahl\u00far, Kir\u00e1t Park\u00e1sh sent an army to its assistance, and he led his forces in person to aid the Garhw\u00e1l R\u00e1j\u00e1 against the Gurkh\u00e1s. In this campaign, however, his ally abandoned the field, leaving the Sirm\u00far forces without provisions, but Kir\u00e1t Park\u00e1sh was, nevertheless, able to make headway against the Gurkhas single-handed, and concluded with them a treaty which fixed the Ganges as the boundary between their kingdoms. Unhappily the R\u00e1j\u00e1 died suddenly on the return march at Lakargh\u00e1t in Sambat 1827.\n\nHe was succeeded by his sons Jagat Park\u00e1sh and Dharm Park\u00e1sh. The latter's reign was an eventful one. R\u00e1j\u00e1 R\u00e1m Singh of N\u00e1l\u00e1garh encroached on the lands of his tributaries, and\nDharm Park\u00e1sh marching against him made the R\u00e1n\u00e1, Jagat Chand, of Bh\u00e1gal, prisoner, and halted at Pinjaur where he levied the tribute due from his feudatories. There he received intelligence that Kanwar Pr\u00e1kram Sh\u00e1h of Sr\u00ednagar had seized the fort of Khushh\u00e1lpur near the Dehra D\u00fan, and despatched an army under Kanwar Isri Singh to recover it. This was effected after a pitched battle in which Pr\u00e1kram Sh\u00e1h was wounded.\n\nAbout this time Sans\u00e1r Chand, Katoch, the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of K\u00e1ngra, invaded the dominions of Mah\u00e1 Chand, R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Kahl\u00far, and took possession of his strongholds north of the Sutlej. Mah\u00e1 Chand thereupon sent men to Dharm Park\u00e1sh to solicit help, promising to pay him a lakh of rupees as nazr\u00e1na, and Dharm Park\u00e1sh accordingly marched at the head of his own troops and those of Kahl\u00far, with his Th\u00e1k\u00e1r allies and R\u00e1m Singh of Hind\u00far, to Charartu on the north bank of the Sutlej and on the boundary of the Katoch territory. In the engagement which ensued he met Sans\u00e1r Chand in single combat and fell by his hand. This event occurred in 1850 Sambat.\u00b9\n\nDharm Park\u00e1sh left no issue and was succeeded by his brother Karm Park\u00e1sh, whose indolence and inexperience were disastrous to the State. The most influential of Dharm Park\u00e1sh's officials, Ajib Singh, Prem Singh and Kishen Singh, conspired with Kanwar Ratan Singh, the R\u00e1j\u00e1's brother, whom they desired to place on the throne. They besieged the R\u00e1j\u00e1 at K\u00e1ngra, a fort, now in ruins, in the D\u00fan, some 32 miles from N\u00e1han. In the fighting that ensued, one Cholu Mi\u00e1n, who closely resembled Karm Park\u00e1sh in appearance, was killed and the rumour spread that the R\u00e1j\u00e1 had been slain. Taking advantage of this the R\u00e1j\u00e1 managed to escape with his family from the fort and reached T\u00e1nor\u00fa, whence, aided by Jhanju headman, he fled to Kalsi. Ratan Park\u00e1sh then seized the throne, but Karm Park\u00e1sh appealed to K\u00e1ji Ranjor Th\u00e1pa, the Gurkha chief, for aid, promising to acquiesce in the Gurkha's seizure of the Dehra D\u00fan, though it lay west of the Ganges. The Gurkhas promptly seized their opportunity and invaded Sirm\u00far, expelled Ratan Park\u00e1sh, and established their own government, leaving Karm Park\u00e1sh in no better position than before. The officials of Kot\u00e1ha, R\u00e1mgarh, L\u00e1harpur, Morni, Pinjaur, Jagatgarh and other places threw off their allegiance to the State, and these fiefs were thus lost to it for ever. Kanwar Gop\u00e1l Singh, the heir-apparent, died about this time, but the Goler R\u00e1ni bore three sons, named Fateh Park\u00e1sh, M\u00e1n Singh and Jai Singh, to the R\u00e1j\u00e1, and thus saved his line from extinction. The R\u00e1j\u00e1 was at this period a refugee in Sub\u00e1thu in the il\u00e1qa of R\u00e1mgarh, which had been granted for faithful service to Khushh\u00e1l Singh, but his sons\n\n\u00b9For a legend, in which Fateh Park\u00e1sh is represented as Sans\u00e1r Chand's opponent, see Temple's Legends of the Punjab, II, page 144.\nM\u00e1ldeo and Nar\u00e1in Singh, though bound by the terms of their grant to furnish troops, renounced their allegiance and told the R\u00e1j\u00e1 to quit Sub\u00e1thu. Upon this the R\u00e1j\u00e1 appealed by a masharn\u00e1ma or protocol, dated May 1st, 1812 A.D., to the neighbouring rulers, but though the document bore the seals of Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja Sahib Singh of Pati\u00e1la and other chiefs, it was fruitless, and the R\u00e1j\u00e1 with his family and wazir, Mauji R\u00e1m Mahta, was compelled to seek an asylum at Buria. The Goler R\u00e1ni, a wise and courageous woman, now took upon herself the direction of the R\u00e1j\u00e1\u2019s affairs and appealed to Colonel Ochterlony, then Political Agent at Ludhi\u00e1na.\n\nThis appeal coincided with the British declaration of war against the Gurkhas, and a force advanced to recover N\u00e1han from them. Having driven the enemy out of Kalingar fort in the D\u00fan the British encamped at N\u00e1han, while K\u00e1ji Ranjor Thapa shut himself up in Jaitak, a fort which stood on a lofty peak, seven miles from N\u00e1han. On the 7th December 1814 the British attacked this stronghold. The Gurkhas evacuated, but fell suddenly upon the British troops, exhausted and disorganized by the difficulties of the ascent. The result was a severe reverse for the British, whose loss was heavy. Jaitak held out for four months until K\u00e1ji Ranjor evacuated it in pursuance of the treaty entered into by the Nep\u00e1l Government with the British in 1815.\n\nS\u00edrm\u00far was in the same year restored to its ancient rulers, but Karm Park\u00e1sh was not reinstated, the sanad being granted to his son Fateh Park\u00e1sh and the Goler R\u00e1ni being appointed regent during his minority. The pargana of Jaunsar, with the forts of Morui, Jagatgarh and the Ki\u00e1rda D\u00fan were, however, retained by the British Government, and that of Hanro Gurchari made over to Keonthal.\n\nKarm Park\u00e1sh continued to reside at Buria till his death in 1826. He had four daughters, one married to Sukhdarshan Sh\u00e1h of Garhw\u00e1l, two to R\u00e1j\u00e1 Bije Chand of N\u00e1l\u00e1garh and the fourth to R\u00e1j\u00e1 Kharak Chand of Bil\u00e1spur. The proposed marriage of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Fateh Park\u00e1sh with a daughter of the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Garhw\u00e1l was not carried out as the expense would have been too great, and General Ochterlony had stopped the levy of the ph\u00e1nt-bi\u00e1hlari or benefice, levied to meet the cost of marrying the R\u00e1j\u00e1\u2019s children. Under the Goler R\u00e1ni\u2019s regency the affairs of the State were not well administered, owing to the self-seeking apathy of the officials, but Mi\u00e1ns Devi Singh and Dal\u00edp Singh, sons of the Mi\u00e1ns Khushh\u00e1l Singh and R\u00e1m Deo, of R\u00e1mgarh, executed a deed of allegiance in 1823, thus attaching R\u00e1mgarh firmly to the State. In 1827 Fateh Park\u00e1sh was invested with full powers under a proclamation of General Ochterlony, and in 1833 the Ki\u00e1rda D\u00fan was restored to him on payment of Rs. 50,000.\nIn 1838 the R\u00e1j\u00e1 offered a contingent for the 1st Afghan War and was thanked by Government for this offer.\n\nOn the outbreak of the 1st Sikh War the R\u00e1j\u00e1 sent a contingent under Dh\u00edraj Singh Khw\u00e1s to join the British at Hari-ki-pattan, where it rendered good service.\n\nR\u00e1j\u00e1 Fateh Park\u00e1sh died in Jeth, Sambat 1907, after a reign of thirty-five years, twenty-three of which were subsequent to his minority. He was an able administrator. He was succeeded by his elder son R\u00e1j\u00e1 Raghb\u00edr Park\u00e1sh. R\u00e1j\u00e1 Raghb\u00edr Park\u00e1sh left three sons, of whom the youngest Kanwar Devi Singh (an illegitimate son) became an Extra Assistant Conservator of Forests, and two daughters, of whom the younger is the mother of Major R\u00e1j\u00e1 Jai Chand of Lamb\u00e1graon.\n\nThe next R\u00e1j\u00e1, Shamsher Park\u00e1sh, inaugurated a new era in the State. During his minority the administration was carried on by the State officials. He was married to a daughter of the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Keonthal, a lady of great beauty and ability, who used to conduct the judicial and administrative business of the State in his absence. On her death he abandoned the palace, making the Shamsher Villa, which he had built, his residence. In her memory he laid out the gardens known as the R\u00e1ni Tal\u00e1b B\u00e1gh at N\u00e1han.\n\nR\u00e1j\u00e1 Shamsher Park\u00e1sh\u2019s policy was to anglicise the administration of the State. He toured incognito throughout India, making himself minutely acquainted with the administration of public offices. He established regular police, judicial and revenue courts, a district board and a public works department, and gave N\u00e1han a municipality. Dispensaries, schools and post-offices were opened and an attempt made to develop the iron mine at Chehta, but this proving unremunerative he established the foundry at N\u00e1han where the well-known sugarcane mills are manufactured. His greatest achievement however was the colonization of the Ki\u00e1rda D\u00fan, hitherto a wild and densely forested tract. The land revenue of the State was also settled and proprietary rights conferred on the zam\u00ednd\u00e1rs. The forests were preserved and became a source of revenue. These and his other reforms will be found fully described in the sections relating to the various State departments.\n\nR\u00e1j\u00e1 Shamsher Park\u00e1sh received a khillat for services rendered in 1857. In Lord Lytton\u2019s viceregency he was appointed a member of the Imperial Legislative Council. He received the K. C. S. I. in 1876 and the G. C. S. I. in 1886, his salute being raised to 13 guns as a personal distinction. He was also accorded the honour of a return visit from the Viceroy. In 1896 the State was removed from the political control of the Superintendent, Simla Hill States, and placed under that of the Commissioner of Delhi.\nAfter a reign of forty-two years, during the last three of which he suffered from ill-health induced by his strenuous devotion to his State, R\u00e1j\u00e1 Shamsher Park\u00e1sh died in October 1898. He was succeeded by the present Chief, R\u00e1j\u00e1 Sarindar Bikram Park\u00e1sh, who was installed by Sir Mackworth Young on October 27th of that year. The R\u00e1j\u00e1 had been carefully educated in the late R\u00e1j\u00e1's time. Born in 1867, he had been raised by degrees to the position of Mu\u00e1wan of the State and had married a daughter of the late R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Suket by whom he has one son, the Tikka Amar Singh, and a daughter. In 1901 the R\u00e1j\u00e1 received the K. C. S. I., and in 1902 he was appointed a member of the Imperial Legislative Council. Accounts of his various reforms will be found under the sections dealing with the Departments concerned. The R\u00e1j\u00e1 made a present of 20,000 lbs. of tea to the Government for the soldiers engaged in the South African War.\n\nThe R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Sirm\u00far ranks sixth among the Punjab R\u00e1j\u00e1s, and is the senior of the R\u00e1jp\u00fat rulers of the Simla Hills.\nRAJAS OF SIRMUR.\n\nR\u00e1j\u00e1 Dharm Park\u00e1sb.\n\nR\u00e1j\u00e1 Karm Park\u00e1sb.\n\nR\u00e1j\u00e1 Fateh Park\u00e1sb, d. 1850.\n\nR\u00e1j\u00e1 Raghb\u00edr Park\u00e1sb, d. 1856.\n\nS\u00e1rjan Singh, d. 1881.\n\nBfr Singh, d. 1883.\n\nRanjor Singh, b. 1874.\n\nR\u00e1j\u00e1 Shamsher Park\u00e1sb, G.C.S.I., b. 1842, d. 1898.\n\nKanwar S\u00farat Singh, b. 1853.\n\nSir Surandar Bikram Park\u00e1sb, K.C.S.I., b. 1867.\n\nMajor P\u00edr Bikram Singh, C.I.E.\nSection C.\u2014Population.\n\nSirmur, with 122 persons to the square mile, stands twelfth in density among the Native States under the Punjab Government (the Simla Hill States being taken as one). The density of the total population on the cultivated area is 935\u00b78 souls to the square mile and the pressure of the rural population on the cultivated and culturable areas is 892\u00b76 and 570\u00b72, respectively.\n\nThe population and density of each Tahsil are shown in the table in margin. The density on the cultivated area is also added to show the actual pressure on the soil. Raink\u00e1 and N\u00e1han are densely populated Tahsils as regards the cultivated area.\n\n| Tahsil | Population (1901) | Density |\n|--------|------------------|---------|\n|        | On total area    | On cultivated area |\n| N\u00e1han  | 17,886           | 86      | 1,111\u00b76 |\n| Paunta | 29,072           | 116\u00b73   | 632     |\n| Raink\u00e1 | 53,243           | 142     | 1,157\u00b74 |\n| Pachh\u00e1d| 35,486           | 126\u00b78   | 959     |\n\nThe State only contains one town, N\u00e1han, its capital, which had, in 1901, a population of 6,256 souls.\n\nThe increase since 1891 is only nominal. The State contains 973 villages. The average population per village (133) is lower than in any other Punjab District or State, except Chamba. 95 per cent. of the population live in the villages. The village of the census returns is purely a revenue unit comprising a number of isolated houses and hamlets. Trans-Giri the natural and ancient unit is the bhoj, which has a common burning ground and a common meeting place for amusements and social or religious gatherings, subscriptions being raised throughout the bhoj in cash and kind for common objects. The people of a bhoj moreover have common leaders, and the bond which unites them is a close one. On the other hand, each large group of houses has a temple of its own, a common thrashing floor and a common stove for frying grain for sattu. Both cis- and trans-Giri detached habitations (dohchis) are common, being used in winter or summer according as the real house is too cold or too hot. Large villages are rare, and the tendency in the newly founded villages is to build a number of detached hamlets near the cultivation, in contrast to the older villages, which were compact, with dohchis near the water-courses, pastures and fields.\n\nTable 6 of Part B shows the population of the State as it stood at the three enumerations of 1881, 1891, and 1901. No census was taken in 1868, but in 1875, at the first settlement, the population was found by a rough census to be 93,099 souls. An increase of 10\u00b75 per cent. in the decade 1881-91 was followed by a further advance of 9\u00b73 per cent. in 1891-1901,\nthe actual increase being 11,553 since 1891. The State's advance in population is wholly due to immigration, but for which it would have actually decreased.\n\nThe increase in population has not been by any means uniform in the different Tahsils, as the marginal table shows. The most prosperous Tahsil is P\u00e1unta which has nearly doubled its population since 1881. N\u00e1han lost in 1891-1901 the increase gained in the preceding decade. Pachh\u00e1d and Raink\u00e1 have increased since 1881 at an equal rate, the period of advance in the former being 1891-1901 and in the latter 1881-91.\n\nThe following table shows the effect of migration on the population of the Sirmur State according to the census of 1901:\n\n| Tahsil | Total Population | Percentage of Increase or Decrease |\n|--------|------------------|-----------------------------------|\n|        | 1881             | 1891                             |\n|        |                  | 1901                             |\n| Total for the State | 112,371          | 124,134                          |\n| N\u00e1han  | 17,525           | 19,320                           |\n| Paunta | 14,414           | 19,476                           |\n| Pachh\u00e1d| 32,179           | 32,493                           |\n| Raink\u00e1 | 49,253           | 52,845                           |\n\nMigration:\nTables 8 and 9 of Part B.\n\n| Immigrants | Persons | Males | Females |\n|------------|---------|-------|---------|\n| I.

The following statement shows the age distribution of 10,000 persons of both sexes:\n\n| Age period | Males | Females | Persons |\n|------------|-------|---------|---------|\n| Infants under 1 | 120   | 116     | 246     |\n| 1 and under 2 | 72    | 70      | 142     |\n| 2 n. 3       | 132   | 123     | 255     |\n| 3 n. 4       | 127   | 133     | 260     |\n| 4 n. 5       | 125   | 114     | 239     |\n| 5 n. 10      | 646   | 574     | 1,220   |\n| 10 n. 15     | 639   | 472     | 1,111   |\n| 15 n. 20     | 486   | 390     | 876     |\n| 20 n. 25     | 473   | 397     | 870     |\n\nIn the lower hills fever is the commonest malady, typhus being unknown. Cholera only appears on an average about once in ten years, and small-pox has not been epidemic since 1890 though isolated cases occur.\n\nIn N\u00e1han town and the lower hills malaria becomes prevalent in April or May, and lasts all through the rains, being at its worst when they cease, in September, after which month till the middle of November the daily average of attendance at the hospital is very high. Enteric is rare. In the upper hills, trans-Giri, malaria and its complications are unknown, and cases of enlarged spleen are always traceable to residence in the lower hills or in the plains.\n\nRelapsing fever is common in the hills nearly every year in the hot weather, and in some years causes a great many deaths. The 'Pah\u00e1ris' dread it as much as they do cholera, isolating the patient and surrounding his house with a thorn hedge.\nSyphilis is unfortunately widespread in the hills, and is a potent factor in determining the population.\n\nIn other respects the health of the people is good.\n\nThe State is entirely free from plague, thanks to the strict enforcement of quarantine rules.\n\nThe custom of placing little children where a stream of water trickles on to their heads (n\u00e1l\u00e1 dena) is as common here as in the neighbouring Hill States. It is said that this process makes the head strong enough to bear the severe cold of a hill winter.\n\nCurious superstitions exist in connection with the ailments of childhood. Two of these are known mith\u00e1 and mas\u00e1ni. The symptoms of mith\u00e1 are coldness in the ears, and it is cured by taking a reed, one foot long, with its roots and repeating a mantra over it. If the child is really suffering from mith\u00e1, the reed is supposed to grow longer by virtue of this mantra, and the extra length is cut off with a sickle. This is done thrice, and the reed is then broken, spat on and thrown away. The exorcist repeats this process for three days. In mas\u00e1ni the child gets thinner day by day, and his body has an offensive smell. To cure this, a herb called g\u00e1tod, which grows in the R\u00e1jpura forests and elsewhere, is used. This root is dried and two ratis of it mixed with the milk of a tigress, k\u00e1li jiri and ajwain (or Ligusticum ajowan). These drugs are rubbed into milk drawn from the mother's breast, and the mixture is given to the child. Another cure is effected with an earthen lamp with thirty-two wicks. In this mustard and other oils are burnt. The lamp is called gain\u00e1. It has a hollow in the centre in which pistachio nuts, flowers and perfumes are placed. Seven marks are made with vermilion on the lamp and one on the forehead of the child. All the thirty-two wicks of the lamp are lit, and after it has been waved round the head of the child and the bead of the mother it is taken beyond the limits of the village and placed in the forest.\n\nThe m\u00e1tri havan or worship of the family deota is observed in the 7th or 9th month of pregnancy to avert miscarriage, by G\u00fajars, Jats and other immigrant tribes, but the hill tribes have no such ceremonies. In Raink\u00e1 the husband refrains from killing any animal with his own hand during his wife's pregnancy, but he may eat meat.\n\nTrans-Giri the mother is attended at birth by her husband, a midwife only being called in in difficult cases, and she herself\nburies the placenta. Rich people usually retain low caste women for general service on such occasions. Gurani (coarse sugar boiled in water) is prepared for the mother by her husband, and ajwain is also given her. The people of Kangra and the adjoining country give sur, their national drink, to the mother; in some cases meat is also given. On the sixth and again on the eleventh day, she plasters the whole house and is then purified, havan being performed, and branches of paja padam and bhikon trees being burnt. Only occasionally are Brahmans fed or a dham (feast) given or a jag held. At the birth of a boy dhakis play music, the fee for which service is one rupee. The period of impurity only lasts eleven days, for which period the mother uses a separate hugga and eating utensils. The chhut or impurity only affects her household, not other relatives. A pujari (priest), however, does not eat anything at their hands for a month, and if a birth occurs in his own house, he does not worship the god for eleven days.\n\nA Brahman casts the child's horoscope on the seventh, ninth, eleventh, or at latest twentieth day after its birth. His fee is one rupee. The child is named when six days, one, three or five months old, on an odd day of the month, and after it has been taken out of the house for the first time.\n\nIn Tahsil Raink\u00e1 and in the trans-Giri parts of Pachhad and Paunta the name is proclaimed aloud by a Brahman or a relative. Sometimes walnuts, or til-chawali (oil-seeds and rice mixed with coarse sugar) are given to the people assembled on this occasion.\n\nWhen a boy is taken out of the house for the first time the people of Nah\u00e1n Tahsil put a piece of silver in his hands and make him touch the earth. The dasuthan or purification ceremony is the most important of the birth customs.\n\nMuch superstition attaches to the naval cord among the hill people.\n\nIn Raink\u00e1 Tahsil, in the higher hills of Paunta and in those parts of Pachhad where the people do not usually employ a midwife, the mother cuts the child's naluwa. In other parts of the country the midwife cuts it. In Nah\u00e1n and amongst those who follow the customs of the plains the part of the naluwa is buried in a secure place, while the trans-Giri people keep it safely. It is generally cut on a piece of silver. The hillmen preserve it carefully to avoid its falling into the hands of a magician or ill-disposed person. Trans-Giri it is believed that its preservation makes the child brave and successful. Both cis- and trans-Giri some people put a small portion of it in a silver case and tie it round the child's neck before it is\n\n---\n\n1 A jag or jay\u00e9 (from jay\u00e9) is the celebration of religious rites through a whole night.\nbrought out of the house. It is also believed in the higher hills that the loss of the *naluwa* is fatal to long life and prosperity. The cloth in which the child was wrapped for the first time is also preserved. In N\u00e1han Tahsil a mother shows it to her children at their marriage and thus reminds them of their obligation to her.\n\nTrans-Giri the midwife is a Chan\u00e1l or a Koli by caste. Elsewhere women of the weaving, cotton-cleaning, Bhand\u00e9la and even Bh\u00e1t castes officiate. Only in N\u00e1han town are skilled midwives found. The lady doctor at the female hospital there teaches the work practically.\n\nThe duties of a midwife differ according to the status of the family. In good families she is not allowed to go out of the house for the first eleven days and is in constant attendance on the mother. On no account is she allowed to serve two patients at once. In other families she is only present at the accouchement, and pays occasional visits after it. Her wages are not fixed, but depend chiefly on the means of the family. They are never less than a rupee with a little grain and *gur*, or coarse sugar, but at the birth of a girl poor people give no money. In rich houses a midwife gets a reward for every service. At the birth of a son she receives a gold or silver ornament or one or more coins according to the father's means. Again, when she cuts the *naluwa* she gets some gold or silver coins; similar gifts are put in the water in which the mother takes her bath, and this is repeated two or three times. When dismissed she gets gifts of clothes, ornaments and cash, and she claims as a right the clothes and bedding used by the mother during her confinement.\n\nIn the Dh\u00e1rthi *il\u00e1ga* of Tahsil N\u00e1han women with large families act as wet-nurses. They take the child to their own home, few going to the child's house. People of the adjoining districts, Amb\u00e1l\u00e1, Sah\u00e1ranpur, Karn\u00e1l, and of Pati\u00e1la and Kalsia States are their chief customers. A wet-nurse gets a cow or its value, clothes and a little cash at the beginning of her service and monthly wages averaging Rs. 5 per month. She is also given clothing for herself and the child, with bedding. When the child is taken from her at the age of four or five she gets a substantial gift of ornaments, clothes and cash, and she is treated on subsequent social occasions in the family as the child's half mother. Wet-nurses of the Dh\u00e1rthi are generally Kanets.\n\nTrans-Giri the father selects a name for the child. Some children are named after the family god or the god, goddess or saint who is supposed to have caused its birth. One whose elder brothers have died in infancy is given an opprobrious name.\nOn the tenth day after the birth ten Brahmans are feasted. Trans-Giri only three Brahmans are fed on the third day. The mother's relations send clothes and ornaments for the child Cis-Giri the father sends some gur with the news of a son's birth to his wife's people and on the Dasuthan day they send silver bangles (karas) and clothes for the child. Other relatives and friends also send clothes and bangles. Rich people also feast relatives and friends on this day.\n\nThe number of males in every 10,000 of both sexes is shown below:\n\n| Census of | In villages | In towns | In the State |\n|-----------|-------------|----------|--------------|\n| All religions |             |          |              |\n| 1881      | ...         | 5,624    | 5,835        | 5,634        |\n| 1891      | ...         | 5,661    | 5,952        | 5,580        |\n| 1901      | ...         | 5,551    | 5,772        | 5,561        |\n| Hind\u00fas    |             |          |              |\n| 1901      | ...         | 5,627    | 5,907        | 5,542        |\n| Sikhs     |             |          |              |\n| 1901      | ...         | 7,341    | 5,500        | 7,020        |\n| Muhammadans |           |          |              |\n| 1901      | ...         | 5,921    | 5,338        | 5,801        |\n\nYear of life.\n\n| Year of life | All religions |\n|--------------|---------------|\n| Under 1 year | 470\u00b75         |\n| 1 and under 2| 490\u00b74         |\n| 2 \" 3        | 481\u00b76         |\n| 3 \" 4        | 508\u00b79         |\n| 4 \" 5        | 475\u00b74         |\n\nThe marginal table shows the number of females to every 10,000 males under five years of age in the census of 1901.\n\nAt N\u00e1han, and in the D\u00fan, both Hind\u00fas and Muhammadians follow the customs of the plains, but the ceremonies in the hills and trans-Giri tracts merit some description. Trans-Giri early marriage is the rule, and children who cannot walk are wedded. In most parts betrothal is arranged before the age of one, but no evils result from this practice, as the girl can dissolve the contract.\nat any time by paying compensation. If, when she comes of age, she dislikes her husband, she returns home, arranges a marriage with some one else, pays *rit* to her first husband, and goes to live with the new one. Her first husband cannot refuse to accept the *rit*, though he may haggle over the amount. Women can thus change their husbands when, and as often as, they choose, and this liberty is not considered an evil. The payment of *rit* is essential, and no second marriage is valid unless and until the first has been dissolved by its payment. It is unlawful to accept payment from a widow, as she is at liberty to remarry without paying it. The same customs prevail in Sain and Dh\u00e1rthi.\n\nA regular betrothal is effected thus:\u2014The bridegroom's people send a seer of *ghi* and a lump of sugar to the bride's relatives. If they accept them, the betrothal is complete. Some people also send clothes, myrtle, *mauli* (red, yellow, and white coloured thread) and even cash. Cis-Giri the age of betrothal varies from five to fifteen, but R\u00e1jp\u00fats effect betrothal and marry between fifteen and twenty, both ceremonies being performed almost simultaneously. The Jamm\u00faw\u00e1l G\u00fajars favour early marriages, as do the Brahmans, B\u00e1nias and similar castes in and around N\u00e1han. Trans-Giri, and to some extent cis-Giri, it is customary to sell daughters, only R\u00e1jp\u00fats avoiding the practice. Brahmans and B\u00e1nias as well as Koh\u00eds and other artizan and trading castes have no objection to it. Well-to-do people, however, avoid it. Thus *pun* marriage, in which the bride's parents receive nothing from the bridegroom, are confined to the upper classes, but the mass of the Kanets and Bh\u00e1ts consider themselves entitled to some compensation for bringing up a daughter. A betrothal is usually cancelled if one of the parties to it becomes insane or is attacked by leprosy or some other incurable disorder. Though it is considered most improper to wantonly cancel a betrothal, the discovery of any physical defect in one of the parties is held to justify it.\n\nTrans-Giri the dowry given to the bride is very small. Even rich people do not give more than thirty or forty rupees worth of articles of all sorts, such as jewelry, clothes and some utensils. Cattle and household furniture are not given. In the cis-Giri hill tracts the dowry is small. On betrothal clothes, utensils, beds, and other household requisites are given, cattle being given at the *phernu ghirnu* (or *mukl\u00e1wa*) when the bride goes to her husband. The idea in giving a small dowry is that on dissolution of the marriage when the husband has to refund the dowry difficulties may not arise.\n\n*Neodhari* are presents made by guests to their host. Among the rural population of the hills these consist of one or more rupees, a little flour and *ghi*, and a he-goat.\nOf the eight distinct forms of marriage recognised by the Hindu Law, the *asur\u00e1* or marriage by purchase is the one peculiarly distinctive of the indigenous people in Sirm\u00far. Whether this form was of Aryan origin or whether it was handed down from the older population, it marks a stage in advance of the system of marriage by capture, but it differs fundamentally from the orthodox Hindu theory of marriage as a sacrament, in that it regards it as a civil contract terminable by the mutual consent of both parties, and the Hindu idea that the wife is one-half of her husband's body is hardly existent in this State, except amongst the R\u00e1jputs and other castes which follow the customs of the plains. At a virgin's wedding religious rites are performed, but they are not essential in a widow's remarriage or in that of a woman purchased from a former husband. In most cases the only ceremonies observed in practice are the fixing of an auspicious day, the putting on of the nose-ring by the priest who officiates for the bride's family, a feast to friends and relations, and the lighting of a sacrificial fire by the village priest, whose knowledge of the Sh\u00e1sstras is limited. Both in the Sain *il\u00e1ga* and trans-Giri, if a man and a woman cannot be married owing to some astrological obstacles, the marriage rites are performed with a brother of the real bridegroom, but he has no claim on the wife whom he has formally married.\n\nAmong some of the Kanets, Bh\u00e1ts, Kol\u00eds, etc., and generally trans-Giri, marriage is not performed in the orthodox manner (*phera*) by circling round the sacred fire, but the *jhajra* form is used or the simple rite of putting the nose-ring into the bride's nose is resorted to. Sometimes in *rit* marriage even this ceremony is dispensed with. *Jhajra* marriage is thus solemnized:\u2014After the betrothal, the bride-groom's father, or in his absence some near relation, goes to the bride's house, with two or three friends, taking with him a *nath*, some dresses and as many ornaments as he chooses to give. The *pandit* recites *mantras* at an auspicious time and the women sing wedding songs. Then the *pandit* places the *nath* in the bride's nose, *gur* or *shakar* is distributed among those present, and then the bride, wearing a red dress, follows the visitors to her husband's home, followed by a relative or two. At an auspicious\n\n---\n\n1 In the Sain *il\u00e1ga* there is a special custom in regard to the fixing of the wedding-day. Each party deputes a number of male relatives and friends, accompanied by the family Brahman, to choose a day, and they usually meet in the bride's parent's house. If they agree on a day, Rs. 2 and five seers of grain are given to the bride on the bridegroom's behalf, and then the whole party goes to a place on the road by which the *bard\u00ed* is expected to enter the village. Here a straight line intersected by thirteen cross lines is drawn. This is called *kar dharna* (*kar*-line), and each cross-line represents a misfortune, the idea being that even if thirteen calamities befall the contracting parties, they will celebrate the wedding. The number of persons in the *bard\u00ed* and even the sum to be paid to the bride's people is also settled, and sometimes paid, at this spot. After this none of the bridegroom's party may enter the bride's village, and the bridegroom may eat no salt until after the wedding.\n\n*Nath lag\u00e1na* or wearing of the nose-ring ceremony is essential both for a *jhajra* and a re-marriage.\nmoment she enters the house. In it has been placed a pitcher of water and on its walls quaint figures are painted, with an earthen lamp put near them. In front of these the bride and bridegroom are seated. Incense is then burnt, and gur given to the bridegroom. This he places in the bride's hand and she eats it. She then gives him gur which he eats in the same way. This completes the marriage. This ceremony is called gir\u0101sni. Two or three days after it, the bride's father comes to the husband's house, with a number of friends and relations, sometimes as many as three hundred or four hundred. These have all to be entertained first with sweets, then with meat, but if the bride's father has accepted compensation for bringing her up, no such entertainment is given. Jhaya is not prevalent in the Sain and Dh\u00e1rthi il\u0101gas in which marriage is by phera. The bridegroom, with his wedding party, goes to the bride's house where they are feasted by her people. Among Kanets and Bh\u0101ts, the bridegroom goes in a p\u0101lki, and the bride is brought to his house in a doli. Kol\u012bs and others go on foot or on horseback, and are not allowed to have a naq\u016bra (or kettledrum) beaten. Trans-Giri the use of a p\u0101lki or doli is considered ill-omened, as only the dead are so carried. In the Dh\u00e1rthi and other il\u0101gas the bride only remains one night in her husband's house, and is then taken home by him and her near relations. Then they are invited to eat four times, after which they return to the bridegroom's house. This custom is called ghernon phernon. Cattle are given to the bride on this occasion, the dowry given at marriage consisting of utensils, ornaments, and clothes.\n\nPolygamy is common both cis- and trans-Giri. A second wife is taken very often, and sometimes a man has as many as four. The main object is to obtain the women's help in cultivation as they do much field-work, besides bringing home grass and fuel. In the Dh\u00e1rthi tract a second wife is often taken, because she can become a source of income by wet-nursing. Other motives also promote polygamy, and a childless man or one who has only girl children will often marry more than one wife. Indeed a sonless wife will often insist on her husband's taking a second wife. At the wedding the second wife is made to sit in one corner of the room, the first wife sitting in the opposite corner, while a woman with a lighted lamp in her hand stands by each of them. Then the family Brahman or an elderly woman stands in the middle of the room and the co-wives, advancing slowly from their respective corners, approach the person in the middle of the room, and he or she joins their hands and they give each other a rupee. The lamps are lighted to prevent the shadow of the one falling on the other. This custom is common in the hills on both sides of the Giri.\n\nBartering away a wife is an ordinary incident of life in the hills, and the full payment of a sum of money to the husband, or to some\none else on his behalf, is sufficient to dissolve a marriage and the woman's subsequent re-marriage holds good both legally and socially, and it has always been held valid for the purposes of a prosecution under section 497 or 498 of the Indian Penal Code and in a suit for the recovery of a wife. Such a marriage is called *rit* (lit. 'custom'), and there are only two essentials for its validity, (i) the husband's consent to the wife's release, and (ii) the payment to him of consideration. This is usually paid, according to the agreement arrived at, to the woman's father, brother or other near male relative, who then arranges with the husband for the dissolution of the marriage. As soon as the husband has received the sum agreed upon the woman is free to live with her new partner.\n\nIt has been judicially decided by the Ijl\u00e1s-i-Kh\u00e1s that the husband's consent is essential to the dissolution of a marriage. The facts were these:\u2014\"One V\u012br Singh, a carpenter, in which caste marriage by purchase prevails, sued his wife Mussamm\u00e1t Gurdevi and others for the restitution of conjugal rights. It was alleged that the wife had left her husband and was living with her parents with the intention of paying consideration to the plaintiff and dissolving the marriage without his consent. It was argued that according to the custom of the country, a wife of her own accord and without the consent of her husband is competent to pay off the consideration (for dissolution of marriage) after removing to her parent's house, but it was held that it did not appear from the provisions of the Riw\u00e1j-i-Am that a woman without the concurrence of her husband can finally conclude the negotiation for the payment of consideration. Even if this proposition is accepted for the sake of argument, yet such a custom is opposed to morality and not in accordance with the doctrine of any religion. There is no provision in the Hindu scriptures enjoining so much liberty to a woman.\"\n\nThe effect of non-payment of consideration to the husband was discussed and decided in the case of Dhania v. Matia. In that case plaintiff Matia alleged that Mussammat Jaino was his lawfully married wife and that the defendant, Dhania, had enticed her away without paying *rit* and kept her under his protection as his wife. There were two children of this cohabitation. The defendant Dhania replied that he had paid Rs. 140 to the relations of Mussammat Jaino, but the plaintiff denied this allegation. The parties were Rajputs, of a caste which adheres to the customary marriage by purchase. It was found as a fact that the sum of Rs. 140 had not been received by the husband, nor was he a consenting party to the dissolution of the marriage, although Mussammat Jaino had\n\n---\n\n1 Civil Appeal No. II of 1958 Sambat, Ijl\u00e1s-i-Kh\u00e1s, dated 13th As\u00e1r, 1959 Sambat;\nbeen living apart from him for many years. The District Judge gave a decree in favour of the plaintiff, holding that the payment of rit to the plaintiff was not proved. The defendant Dhania appealed to the Ijl\u00e1s-i-Kh\u00e1s against this decree, and it was held by that court that the question for decision was whether the plaintiff Matia had received this consideration for the dissolution of marriage.\n\nIf a woman is pregnant at the time of the dissolution of the marriage, the child goes to the first husband unless he waives his claim to it, in which case the new husband is deemed to be the father of the child. But when a claim to a child in the womb is waived its value is taken into consideration in fixing the amount of the rit money. The children already born are taken by their father. In a family in which polyandry is allowed the children may choose the father with whom they wish to live. But when a partition is effected the children generally go to the brother to whom their mother is allotted.\n\nPrimitive as the system is, there can be no doubt that any attempted reform would be strenuously opposed by the people. The natural result of the system is a considerable laxity in morals, there being a good deal of freedom before marriage, while married women often elope in anticipation of its dissolution.\n\nIn the trans-Giri country and in the Pachh\u00e1d and Sain il\u00e1q\u00e1s of Tahs\u00edl Pachh\u00e1d, Sirm\u00fari Pah\u00e1ri is spoken. It differs from the Pah\u00e1ri of other districts in idiom and even in vocabulary, and varies in different waz\u00edris. The language of the trans-Giri waz\u00edris retains more Sanskrit words and many Hindi words which have now been abandoned in the plains: for instance bhalk\u00e9 means \"early morning\" in the Panjhota il\u00e1qa, trans-Giri. It bore this meaning in the Punjab a hundred years ago, and with the meaning of 'to-morrow' is still used in the central Punjab. In fact the trans-Giri Sirm\u00fari is a mixture of Hindi Bh\u00e1sha, the Pah\u00e1ri of the Simla District, the Bil\u00e1spur State Panj\u00e1b\u00ed, and Sanskrit with a little Urdu. In Dh\u00e1rthi, Pachh\u00e1d, and Sain, Urdu has generally replaced Hindi.\n\nIn N\u00e1han Urdu is spoken, but, with a few exceptions, in an impure form. The ruling family and educated people speak good Urdu, while with others it is mixed with Panj\u00e1b\u00ed. Indeed Panj\u00e1b\u00ed is the language of immigrants. In the khol\u00eds the dialect of the Amb\u00e1l\u00e1 District is the language of the rural population.\n\nThe Jats, Sain\u00eds, Lab\u00fanas, Banj\u00e1ras, Baht\u00eds and Gujars are all immigrant castes which have settled in and colonised the Ki\u00e1rda D\u00fan. Most of them are Sikhs. The Baht\u00eds are an industrious community, and the Gujars, immigrants from Jammu, are stalwart and turbulent cow-herds who winter in the D\u00fan, and drive their buffaloes to the higher hills in the hot weather.\nOne minor caste meriting notice is the Bhand\u00e9la, known as sikligar or M\u00e1rw\u00e1ri in the plains. They appear to have come from M\u00e1rw\u00e1r in the Mughal times, and retain their peculiar speech and intonation. They also are Sikhs by religion, and by occupation are dealers in arms, etc. They are much given to crime.\n\nThe R\u00e1jp\u00fats are numerically few, mustering 2,964 Hind\u00fas, 159 Sikhs and 553 Muhammadans in 1901, and it is noteworthy that the Sikhs among them are not 'Singhs' and have not taken the pahul. Their g\u00f2ts, 54 in number, include Chauh\u00e1n, Atri, Pand\u00edr, Panw\u00e1r, Tunw\u00e1r, K\u00e1shyap and Taoni, with a few Kachhw\u00e1h\u00e1. The R\u00e1jp\u00fats are chiefly found cis-G\u00edri. They marry within the g\u00f2t, but not in the same branch of it. R\u00e1jp\u00fat families are of two classes\u2014ruling and non-ruling; the former being sub-divided into legitimate and non-legitimate branches, while the latter are sub-divided into Mi\u00e1ns and those who are not so called. R\u00e1jp\u00fats of the ruling family used to be called Kanwar or Bh\u00e1o, but owing to their numbers these titles now command little respect. The sub-divisions of the R\u00e1jp\u00fat families arise out of the typical R\u00e1jp\u00fat custom of giving one or more slave-girls (khw\u00e1s) in marriage with the bride. With these a part of the marriage rites are performed, and their sons, though legitimate in a sense, cannot inherit, but receive maintenance. Such sons are called Kanwars, and intermarry as a class. Some of them have sunk to Kanet status. Mi\u00e1n is not so exalted a designation as it is in the K\u00e1ngra District. The R\u00e1jp\u00fats of Sirm\u00far follow rather the customs of R\u00e1jp\u00fat\u00e1na than those of K\u00e1ngra and have less scruple about ploughing. While preferring to marry their daughters into a class higher than their own, they do not doom them to remain unwed, if no such alliance offers. In other respects they are as punctilious as the R\u00e1jp\u00fats of the K\u00e1ngra hills.\n\nOnly pure and Khas Kanets are found in Sirm\u00far, the latter generally trans-G\u00edri. Each group claims superiority, but the former are the more civilised. Intermarriage between these groups is unusual. The Sharai (or followers of the Muhammadan law) form a sub-division of the Kh\u00e1s Kanets. They are descended from an ancestor who, being hardpressed, submitted and acknowledged himself to be a Koli of his oppressors. The Kh\u00e1s Kanets of Shillai, Badnaur, Ankot and Jadaur will not give their daughters in marriage to Sharai Kanets. The N\u00e1han Kanets prefer to marry their daughters in a higher family, if they can. They wear the sacred thread (janu), imitate R\u00e1jp\u00fat customs, and stand higher, socially, than the other Kanets. Kanets are generally agriculturists and owners of land. A Kanet by marrying a Brahmani remains a Kanet, but if he marry a low-caste woman he is out-casted. Some Kanet families, by performing the duties of priests, have acquired the sect name\nof Dewa or Negi. A Dewa will generally marry in a Dewa and a Negi in a Negi family.\n\nKanets, both simple and Kh\u00e1s, are divided into khels or clans within which they do not marry. These khels are named either after a village or an ancestor. Besides these clans the Kanets have g\u00f4ts, such as Chauh\u00e1n, Panw\u00e1r, etc., which are also R\u00e1jp\u00fat clans. Generally they intermarry within the g\u00f4t, but the more civilized Kanets of N\u00e1han and Sain do not marry in their own g\u00f4t. Thus a Chauh\u00e1n Kanet of N\u00e1han will not marry a Chauh\u00e1n Kanetni. One of the most important khels is Jaitki, so called after the village of Jaitak. The ancestor of this khel was a Khatri of Sam\u00e1na, who took a Kanetni wife and thus became a Kanet.\n\nA Kanet may marry two sisters. Trans-Giri a Kanet may marry his mother's brother's daughter, and even his father's sister's daughter. But the more civilized do not allow this. Occasionally too a wife's niece is married.\n\nA Kanet may not marry an aunt, a son's wife, a nephew's wife, nor the wife of a son or nephew. Generally Kanets marry Kanet women, but in Karli a Kanet may ordinarily marry even a Bh\u00e1t wife. The principle is that a Kanet may marry, or cohabit with, a woman of the higher caste, but if he does so with one of a lower class, he is out-casted. Similarly a Kanetni may cohabit with a Brahman without being out-casted, but if she does so with a low-caste man, she will be out-casted. A Brahman by cohabiting with a Kanetni remains a Brahman, but if he marries a Kanetni his children become Kanets.\n\nThe Brahmans, mostly adh-Gaurs, are confined to the townships or villages inhabited by immigrants from the plains. The Gaurs have two divisions, pure Gaurs and gattas, the latter of illegitimate descent. These are said not to intermarry. The adh-Gaurs are further divided into chitt\u00e9 and k\u00e1li kanthiv\u00e1l\u00e1s, who do not intermarry. The latter do not take food or drink from the hands of a woman who has reached puberty.\n\nThe highest section among the trans-Giri Brahmans is the Pabuch. They do not intermarry with Bh\u00e1ts, and may eat food cooked by Bh\u00e1t girls, but not if cooked by another Pabuch. Similarly a Pabuch may not eat food cooked by a girl of his own group when she has been married to a Bh\u00e1t. The Pabuch refrain from killing any animal and abstain from eating flesh.\n\nThere appears but little doubt that the Bh\u00e1ts are by origin Brahmans. They were by occupation genealogists, and adopted karewa, whereby they lost status. Many are now cultivators, and, trans-Giri, intermarry with Kanets. In all other respects\n\n---\n\n1 Of their 69 g\u00f4ts, Bh\u00e1rudw\u00e1j and Sahal are numerically the strongest. Panw\u00e1r, Chauh\u00e1n, Itri are also Bh\u00e1t g\u00f4ts, pointing to an admixture of R\u00e1jp\u00fat or Kanet blood.\n\nThere is a Bh\u00e1t sub-division in the higher hills called D\u00e9ti, but the rest of the Bh\u00e1ts do not intermarry with them, and they are inferior to the other sub-divisions. Dewas are priests of temples and may be either Kanets or Bh\u00e1ts.\nthe Bh\u00e1ts of N\u00e1han retain Brahman customs, but in the interior they have adopted those of the Kanets. Trans-Giri, their numbers are double those cis-Giri.\n\nTrans-Giri the R\u00e1jp\u00fats, Kanets and Bh\u00e1ts can smoke together, take water from, and eat kachi and pakki roti at, each others hands. They can drink fresh water brought by a Koli in a metal vessel, and can prepare their food in the house of a Loh\u00e1r, B\u00e1jgi or Koli when it has been plastered with cow-dung. The order of precedence of castes is:\u2014Bh\u00e1t, Deva, Dethi, Kanet, Loh\u00e1r, B\u00e1di, B\u00e1jgi, Koli, Chan\u00e1l and D\u00e1mra.\n\nA Loh\u00e1r does not eat at the hands of a B\u00e1di or B\u00e1jgi. Cis-Giri, Kanets and Bh\u00e1ts will not even drink water touched by a Koli. No caste except R\u00e1jp\u00fats, Bh\u00e1ts and Kanets can enter a temple. A Koli or other low-caste man should not let his shadow fall upon a high caste person.\n\nIf a person marries one of lower caste he is expelled from his caste for ever, but if he merely cohabits with one of lower caste, or smokes or eats with or at the hands of such a person, he is excused. If the act is unintentional, re-entrance into the caste is easy, but if intentional, it is expensive and troublesome. When an accusation of this kind is brought against a person, a panch\u00e1yat is convened and holds an enquiry. If the allegation is proved, the accused is made an outcast, but if it is disproved, the complainant is made to pay a dand or fine. Not only is the condemned man out-casted, but those who eat, drink or smoke with him are also considered outcasts. If an out-cast desires to re-enter his caste, he again convenes the panch\u00e1yat and craves forgiveness. If his fault was unintentional, he is made to give a dinner to the bar\u00e1dri and to feast Brahmans; sometimes he is also sent to bathe in the Ganges. But if the offence was intentional, he must perform par\u00e1schit, go to the Ganges and give a big feast to Brahmans and the bar\u00e1dri. In either case a he-goat is sacrificed. Trans-Giri, this latter panch\u00e1yat should consist of the members of at least four khels. In N\u00e1han and cis-Giri more orthodox measures are taken to re-admit an outcast.\n\nIf a man marries a wife of lower caste, he sinks to that caste and both trans- and cis-Giri his descendants cannot inherit as collaterals from a member of the family who has died childless. Though this custom has not yet been upheld in a court of law after full enquiry, it is alleged that such a man is debarred from all inheritance, but he may no doubt keep ancestral property which has already come into his possession. The present custom does not deprive him of his property, but trans-Giri his descendants are alleged to receive no share in it.\n\n*Thus a Kanet by marrying a Koli becomes a Koli, a Bh\u00e1t becomes a Kanet by marrying a Kanet, and so on.*\nTrans-Giri, sons inherit on equal terms without regard to the status of the mother or how she was married, but the eldest son receives an extra share called *jithong*, and the youngest one called *kanchhong*, the intermediate sons receiving no extra shares. The *kanchhong* consists of an extra share of the dwelling house and the *jithong* of an extra and selected field. But in the Pachh\u00e1d *il\u00e1qa* of Tahs\u00edl Pachh\u00e1d the eldest brother receives a *jithong* of four *pathas* of land (equal to $1\\frac{1}{2}$ *bighas kachcha*), and the youngest receives Rs. 8 in cash, or a few utensils.\n\nIn a family which practises polyandry a brother inherits from a brother so long as partition is not made. The principle is that in a joint family sons do not become fatherless when a reduction occurs in the number of fathers. The connection of son and father still survives and the children have a claim to the inheritance of the surviving fathers. Sons by a woman who is kept as a wife, but for whom no *rit* has been paid, or with whom no formal ceremony has been gone through, generally inherit their father's property. This custom has been contested, but is generally accepted.\n\nA woman of lower caste kept as a wife or a woman of whatsoever caste openly kept as a concubine (*khv\u00e1s*) is not a lawful wife and her sons do not inherit.\n\nA childless widow has a life interest in her husband's estate which she cannot alienate without lawful necessity. This is the general custom of Sirm\u00far. A widow may make an adoption with the consent of her collaterals. She cannot make a gift of the immovable property. On re-marriage a widow looses her life interest in her deceased husband's property.\n\nDaughters are not heirs, but if there is no collateral within the seventh generation, then a daughter's son, or, in his absence, a sister's son inherits. Both trans-Giri and in the hill tract of the cis-Giri a father or a brother can give a part of landed property to a daughter or a sister in charity. But there should be a written deed of gift.\n\nOn a partition brothers are divided if possible into equal groups and the wives are also equally divided, but where the wives or brothers are an odd number those who take the wife or wives pay the marriage expenses of the one who does not get a wife. Other property is divided according to the brothers' shares, i.e., equally in a family which does not follow the *jithong* custom, or, in a family which does follow that custom, unequally, according to that custom.\nA childless man can adopt a boy of his own family or caste, but he cannot make a gift of his estate to any one in preference to his collaterals. A gift of a portion of the immovable property in charity is allowed.\n\nThe custom of ch\u00e1ndawand (per stirpes) does not prevail here. The pagwand (per capita) is the prevailing custom. Grandsons inherit their father's property. Daughters cannot inherit, but trans-Giri a father can give a share of his property to his daughter for his life-time only.\n\nDaughters, however, receive equal shares in the absence of any male heir or collateral.\n\nThe following is a short account of some of the most notable men in the State:\n\nSird\u00e1r Rand\u00edp Singh is the son and successor of the late Sird\u00e1r S\u00farat Singh, and grandson of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Raghb\u00edr Park\u00e1sh and first cousin of the present R\u00e1j\u00e1. He lost both his parents in 1901, when he was six years old. His estate is managed by the old officials of his father under the direct control of His Highness the R\u00e1j\u00e1.\n\nKanwar Ranzor Singh is the grandson of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Fateh Park\u00e1sh. He has large estates both in and out of Sirm\u00far and is the wealthiest man in the State. He enjoys the powers of a 2nd class Magistrate, Munisif and Assistant Collector in his j\u00e1g\u00edr villages. He has no legitimate son.\n\nK\u00e1nwar Devi Singh is the illegitimate son of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Raghb\u00edr Park\u00e1sh and is serving in the State Forest Department as an Extra Assistant Conservator. His youngest son is a graduate of the Punjab University and is employed in the Military Department of the Baroda State.\n\nMahant Paras R\u00e1m D\u00e1s is seventh in descent from Mahant Banw\u00e1ri D\u00e1s at whose suggestion R\u00e1j\u00e1 Karm Park\u00e1sh made N\u00e1han his capital. He enjoys a j\u00e1g\u00edr.\n\nThe bulk of the population of Sirm\u00far is by religion Hindu, but there are a certain number of Muhammadans, and a few Christians, Sikhs and Jains, the exact data being given in Table 15 of Part B.\n\nThe Hind\u00faism of Sirm\u00far is of two types, the orthodox Brahminical type cis-Giri and a more primitive type trans-Giri; the latter resembling in many respects the Hind\u00faism of the Himalayas as found in Kumaon to the east and the Simla Hills to the north, and regarded as unorthodox by the Hind\u00fas of the plains. Orthodox Hind\u00faism has been described and discussed in many standard works, and it is unnecessary to touch here upon its characteristics, but the cults and beliefs peculiar to this State or to the Himalayas generally merit some notice.\nTrans-Giri Brahmin influence is weak, but the priests who are often Bh\u00e1ts and sometimes Kanets, appear to have considerable power, and religious ideas are potent for good or evil. For instance, a god is invoked (deot\u00e1 lag\u00e1na) out of enmity, love or greed, and the man against whom he is invoked dare not do the act to prevent which the invocation is made. Thus a husband will supplicate a god to prevent her from being unfaithful in his absence, and the precaution is effective, for severe punishment would assuredly be inflicted by the god if she were not faithful.\n\nThe legend of Paras R\u00e1m and Jamdaggan\u2019s wife, Raink\u00e1, is well known and need not be given here. The centre of the cult of Paras R\u00e1m is at Raink\u00e1-jio in the Tahsil of that name. Here, after Paras R\u00e1m\u2019s mother had become jal sar\u00fap or water, she fell into the larger tank at Raink\u00e1, his brothers falling into the smaller.\u00b9\n\nThere are two temples at Raink\u00e1,\u2014one, the old temple, on the shores of the lake; the other built on a hillock on the bank of the Paras R\u00e1m tank. The former is built like a hill house with a slate roof. Its door faces west. It has a single image of Ganeshji made of stone. The new temple is approached from the east by a broad flight of steps leading to a spacious courtyard. It is square in shape with a dome roof surmounted by a bronze pinnacle. The doors of the temple face east, north and south, but the two latter are only open on a fair day. This temple contains seventeen images:\u2014Of Paras R\u00e1m, two, one of stone and one of Jodhpur marble; of Jamdaggan Rishi, Raink\u00e1ji, Ganesh, Shivji, Durga, Khsetrp\u00e1l, Digp\u00e1l, five images of the P\u00e1ndavas, one of Kid\u00e1r Bhairon, and one of P\u00e1walia.\u00b2 Of these, the images of Paras R\u00e1m, Raink\u00e1 and Jamdaggan are asth\u00e1pan, or fixed in the ground, and have silver canopies, chhatr\u00e1s, over them. The fair is held on the Deo-uthni ik\u00e1dshi in K\u00e1tik, lasting two days, and twelve images visit the temple on that day. These are four images of Paras R\u00e1m from Jambu, from Kot\u00e1ha, from Masho in bhoj Mast and from Dog\u00e1na, all in Raink\u00e1 Tahsil; three images of Shirigul, from M\u00e1unal Dewa in bhoj Nohra in Raink\u00e1, and from Shaia in bhoj Pajhota, Tahsil Pachh\u00e1d, and from Jaitak in N\u00e1han Tahsil; the images of L\u00e1 Devi from Barla, in N\u00e1han, of M\u00e1nar Devi from M\u00e1naria, and of Nai\u00e1 Devi from Baila in bhoj Nanoa in Tahsil Raink\u00e1; and the images of the gods Gau, from Mohar Kotla, and\n\n\u00b9 H\u00edra, puj\u00e1ri of Raink\u00e1, says that Paras R\u00e1m\u2019s brothers did not become water, and no tank is attributed to them, the smaller tank being generally known as Paras R\u00e1m\u2019s tank. Jamdaggan called the brothers cowards, and turned them into women, so that they are now known as Paras R\u00e1m\u2019s sisters and called dev\u00e1s or goddesses. The eldest is L\u00e1 Devi in Birla village (described amongst Dev\u00e1s); the second Dormai; the third Bhadmachhri (or Bhador-K\u00e1li); these two live together and have several temples, the most important in Sirmur being at Detar (a village in Paunta Tahsil); and the fourth Kamli, whose temple is at Chana in Raink\u00e1 Tahsil.\n\n\u00b2 Or Paulia, lit. \u2018door-keeper.\u2019 An attendant of Paras R\u00e1m, as Hanum\u00e1n is of R\u00e1ma, who was born at Sirmur and so also called Sirm\u00fari.\nof B\u00e1rah R\u00fapi, from K\u00e1non Ongar, both in Raink\u00e1 Tahs\u00edl. These images are brought in State to visit the fair at Raink\u00e1, each being carried in a palanquin and accompanied by men bearing flags and silver maces, musicians, and the people of its village. The image of Paras R\u00e1m from Jambu is treated with special ceremony, and as it passes through the fair, the shop-keepers offer to it a little of everything they have on sale. The images arrive about 4 p.m. on the first day of the fair, remaining the next day and returning in the evening, or early on the third day.\n\nThe temple of Paras R\u00e1m at Jambu, the birth-place of this god, has three storeys, the image being kept in the topmost storey. The door faces south. The nine puj\u00e1ris are Bh\u00e1ts of Hiun, and take the duties for a month each in turn. The puj\u00e1ri on duty must not go to his house or visit his wife, but lives in the temple. At day-break the b\u00e1jgi or musician awakens the god by playing on his flute,\u00b9 and in the evening he goes round to all the houses enquiring if every one has eaten the evening meal, and then plays the flute, after which no one may eat, as the deota is then believed to sleep. Worship is held twice daily, in the morning and evening. In the morning the puj\u00e1ri bathes and himself fetches water which he sprinkles over the idol. He then sounds the conch and lights a lamp of ghi, reciting the following mantra:\n\n'Pahle B\u00e1rah R\u00fapi aut\u00e1r uttare, B\u00e1rah ki m\u00e1t\u00e1 Chandrawati, pit\u00e1 Padhm\u00e1vati; phir Budh R\u00fapi aut\u00e1r uttare, Budh ki m\u00e1t\u00e1 Udhm\u00e1vati, pit\u00e1 Kanval Rishi.'\n\nOnce more the image is sprinkled with water and the conch sounded. During the service the b\u00e1jgi plays the flute and the puj\u00e1ri rings a bell continuously. There are some seventy images in the temple. That of Paras R\u00e1m, which is of brass, is alone asth\u00e1pan, being fixed in the place reserved for the presiding god. It has a gold chhatar, a necklace of rupees with a gold mohar, in which is set a diamond in the middle, a silver palanquin with a golden dome, and a mace. The god is worshipped as a guardian against disease in men or cattle, and if a man has suffered wrong, he invokes curses (jag\u00e1r dena) on his enemy who becomes possessed by the god and falls sick. The god does not possess the puj\u00e1ri.\n\nThe temple at Dog\u00e1na is a small one of one storey only. It contains three images of stone and two of brass; one of the latter was broken by the Gur\u00fa's jhalla\u00b2 or deputy in a fit of frenzy.\n\n\u00b9 In every large temple, trans-Giri, music is played twice daily, once early in the morning to awaken the god, and again late in the evening to make him sleep. After the evening music, people are prohibited from taking food, but, at the same time, if any one goes to bed hungry, the god gets the blame. Accordingly the musicians, before playing, ascertain whether there is any person in the village who has not supped.\n\n\u00b2 Lit. 'idiot.' He is supposed to have every now and then fits of ecstasy during which he is endowed with superhuman powers.\nThis involved the villagers in a curse, and so the third stone image was brought from Raink\u00e1. The unbroken brazen image is asth\u00e1pan. Both the brazen images came from Keonthal. The rites are similar to those at Jambu and the puj\u00e1ris here are also Bh\u00e1ts.\n\nThe temple at Mah\u00e1su originally covered a stone brought from Raink\u00e1 to protect the people against evils. Two brazen images, each eleven inches high, were added; both are of Paras R\u00e1m. The ritual and offerings are the same as those at the Jambu temple, and the god possesses the puj\u00e1ri (deot\u00e1 utart\u00e1 hai or puj\u00e1ri par ut\u00e1r\u00e1 j\u00e1t\u00e1 hai) as at Raink\u00e1. There is no fair, but if the deota does not visit Raink\u00e1 as described, the people celebrate a j\u00e1ga on the day of the Raink\u00e1 fair.\n\nAs a god, Paras R\u00e1m, when angry, causes poverty and sickness, both among men and cattle. A vow to the god, if unfulfilled, brings down his wrath upon one's children, but his favour brings offspring and success. In worshipping the god, a pitcher of silver or brass is filled with water from a sacred spring, and no shadow must fall on it while being filled. Conches are sounded, lamps lighted, and leaves of the bet or bael and lotus, and rice are placed before his image. Incense also is burned, and the following mantra repeated:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Diw\u00e1 bal\u00e9 Ghant\u00e1 hal\u00e9,} \\\\\n\\text{J\u00e1gli jot bikham tal\u00e9,} \\\\\n\\text{Loheka b\u00e1r, lohek\u00e1 bandarv\u00e1r,} \\\\\n\\text{R\u00e1chhi\u00e1 kar\u00f3 M\u00e1t\u00e1 K\u00e1lk\u00e1,} \\\\\n\\text{Tumh\u00e1re n\u00e1m ka jai-jai k\u00e1r.}\n\\]\n\nThe god does not descend upon the worthy or the noble, but only upon men of evil life, or upon the puj\u00e1ri, upon whom he is invoked by the people who assemble in his dwelling with music, prayer and obeisance. The man possessed is offered incense, or ghi burnt as incense. At first the god only manifests himself gently, but at last the person possessed begins to shiver, and with loud cries beats the ground with both hands. The man who desires to consult the oracle then states his wrongs, and is told their causes and the measures to be taken to remove them.\n\n---\n\n1 The lamp shines bright, the temple bell rings clear,\nLet light remain, let evil disappear,\nIn iron trappings is no refuge found,\nO Mother K\u00e1lk\u00e1, keep us safe and sound;\nAnd give Thy name the Victory,\nThe direct worship of Shiva is not very popular in the hills, but the cults of Shirigul and Mah\u00e1su are branches of Shivaism. Cis-Giri some temples are dedicated to Shiva, and on the top of the Ch\u00far peak is a Shivling. There is also a temple of Mah\u00e1deo at Bechar Deothi, but it is significant that he is not unanimously identified with Shiva. At Pair\u00edw\u00e1la,\u00b9 two or three miles below Nah\u00e1n, is a temple of Shiva said to have been built by Shankara Acharya, near what are said to be of ruins of wells and a palace ascribed by the people to the famous R\u00e1j\u00e1 Ras\u00e1lu, son of Saliv\u00e1han.\n\nThe head-quarters of this god are at Sion village in Raink\u00e1 Tahsil, where he has a temple on a small hillock at the foot of which flows the Giri. It is close to the village and shaped like a hill house with two storeys only. The gods are kept on a gambar or wooden shelf. There are one large brass idol and several smaller ones including Sirm\u00fari and Devi Shiml\u00e1asan. The former is the tutelary deity of Sirm\u00far, but has no temple of his own. All these idols, except those of Sirm\u00fari and Shiml\u00e1asan, represent Mah\u00e1su. If there is a death or birth in the family of the Deva, the temple must be closed for 20 days because neither a pilgrim (j\u00e1tri) nor a Deva can enter the temple within 20 days of a domestic occurrence. The morning worship is called dh\u00fap dena and the evening sandh\u00edria. Legend says that one morning the god Mah\u00e1su appeared in a dream and told the ancestor of the present Deva to seek him in the Giri and build him a temple in the village. Accordingly the Deva went to the Giri and found on its banks the big idol which is also called Jal\u00e1san (i.e., set up in water). Mah\u00e1su is not so widely worshipped as Shirigul or Paras R\u00e1m. The present Deva says he is 12th in descent from the man who found the idol.\n\nOne of the oldest and most important temples of Shirigul (whose name is probably a corruption of Sri-Guru) is on the Dh\u00e1r Ch\u00far or Ch\u00far Peak, and regarding it a long legend is related in which the Muhammadan emperor of Delhi plays a not very dignified part. Shirigul, a devotee, went to the Ch\u00far peak upon which Shiva dwelt. Having acquired superhuman power from his association with the god, Shirigul caused all the boys of the neighbourhood to be afflicted with worms, while he himself assumed the form of a Bh\u00e1t, and wandered from village to village proclaiming that if the boys' parents built him a temple on the Dh\u00e1r he would cure them all. The temple was built and Shirigul began to be considered a separate deity.\n\n\u00b9There is a famous kund (or pond) near the old ruins. It is called the mdy\u00e1 ka kund (or pond of wealth), and it is said that once a she-buffalo fell into it, and when dragged out a gold kant\u00ed, or necklace, was found tied to her horns. The cow herd took the kant\u00ed and set off home, but became blind. In his terror he threw the necklace back into the kund and regained his sight.\nThe temple of Shirigul is square and faces east. It has but one storey, with a verandah, and its roof is a gable, the topmost beam (khinwar) of which is adorned with brass vessels (anda) fixed to it by pegs. Outside the temple is hung a necklace (m\u0101la) of small pieces of wood (kharori). There is only one door, on which figures have been carved. Inside this temple is another smaller temple also of deodar shaped like a dome and in this is kept the ling, which is 6 inches high and 4 inches in circumference. It is made of stone, and is placed in a jalauri, or vessel of water, which too is of stone. No clothes or ornaments are placed on the ling.\n\nA worshipper brings with him his own Bh\u00e1t who acts as puj\u00e1ri. The Bh\u00e1t must not eat until he has done worship and made offerings. He first bathes in the adjacent spring, puts on clean clothes and lights a lamp, burning ghi, not oil, before the idol. Then he takes a brass lota of fresh water, and sprinkles it over the idol and the floor of the temple with a branch of the bhikhon or chh\u00e1nbar shrub. He next fills a spoon with embers ghi and the leaves of the katharch\u00e1l and lahesri (odoriferous plants found on the Dh\u00e1r), and burns them before the idol, holding the spoon in his right hand while he rings a bell with his left, and repeats the names of tirthas and avatars only. After this office he blows a conch, and finally prostrates himself before the idol. Worship may be at any time. The j\u00fatri or worshipper now bathes, puts on clean clothes, and prostrates himself before the idol. After this he may make the offerings which ordinarily consist of a ratti of gold or silver, money, ghi (but not more than two chhitt\u00e1s), a pice or two, small vessels (anda) of pewter or copper which are hung on the temple, and a he-goat. The benefits sought are secular, not spiritual.\n\nThe legend of Bijat, the lightning god, which is connected with that of Shirigul, relates that when the Asur Agyasur, the great demons who were hostile to the gods, assailed the Ch\u00far peak and the temple of Shirigul thereon, the god fell upon them in the form of lightning, whence an image fell to earth at Sar\u00e1han in Jubbal, and at that place a temple was built for the image, which was placed, with other images, in it. From Sar\u00e1han a Deva, the ancestor of the present Devas of Deona, brought a stone idol of Bijat to Deona, and this is now the principal image in the temple, and is considered to possess the most power. There are twenty-seven other images, all of brass.\n\nThe stone idol is to the left of all the minor images, and is never clothed or ornamented. Of the rest four are covered with old silk (masru), and have pieces of woollen stuff round their necks,\n\n---\n\n1 *Precedence of deities in a temple.*\u2014The presiding image is that which is the most powerful and is placed in the centre, the others being placed on either side of it in the order of their powers, the more powerful being seated near the presiding image, and the others farther from it. Dependants occupy lower seats, in front. All the images face to the west in the high hills.\nstudded with eighty rupees, and fifteen gold mohars. The remaining twenty-three have no clothes or ornaments. All have human faces.\n\nThe fair of Bijat is held on any three days between Bais\u00e1kh Ist and the end of Jeth. It is called Bisu, because it is usually held in Bais\u00e1kh, and is held annually in Deona, and every third or fourth year in Chokar, Sanej and Andheri villages. It resembles the fair at Manal, and the thoda game is played.\n\nThe temple of Bijat at B\u00e1ndal was founded in this wise. The Devas at Deona multiplied, and so one of them came to B\u00e1ndal with a brass image of Bijat from the temple there, and built a separate temple. There are now fifty-two images of Bijat in the B\u00e1ndal temple. All are of brass, with human faces. Only the five primary images are clothed, and these have garments studded with rupees and gold mohars. They are considered to possess more power than the remaining forty-seven, and the principal of them, the one brought from Deona, is placed in the centre and reposes in a silver chauki.\n\nBijai, as a goddess, has a temple, seven storeys high, at Batrol, where the image is of brass and has a woman's face. It is clothed in silk and ornamented. The Bh\u00e1ts, but not the Kanets, serve as puj\u00e1ris. A pilgrim to the temple is fed once on behalf of the god. When a he-goat is sacrificed the blood is sprinkled over the temple. For a j\u00e1g\u00e1\u00b9 the idol is taken to a worshipper's house where a he-goat is killed and the flesh distributed among those present. The ritual resembles that of Shirigul, but there is no fair.\n\nClosely connected with the cult of Bijat is that of the goddess Ghatri\u00e1li, who has a temple at Panj\u00e1han in Raink\u00e1 Tahsil, similar to that of Bijat at Batrol. The ritual is also the same, and no fair is held. The legend regarding this temple avers that a certain Kanet chieftain, Bija by name, of Tathwa village, once sallied forth with eighteen of his followers to attack his enemies in D\u00e1har. When the assailants reached D\u00e1har they were seized with a sudden panic and fled homewards, but on reaching Bholu\u00e1, a mile from D\u00e1har, they met some women bearing pitchers. On asking who they were, they were told that the women belonged to Jam-log, a village at which a j\u00e1g\u00e1 in honour of Bijat was being celebrated, and that they had come to fetch water. Bija asked if he and his companions could see the j\u00e1g\u00e1, and was told that they could come and\n\n\u00b9 See footnote at page 26 ante.\nsee it, but must show no fear of what they saw even when offered seats of serpents and scorpions by the people of Jam-log. The women also said they would be offered grains of iron to eat, and gave them rice which they could eat instead, concealing the iron. Lastly, the women said that if they were desired to take the image to their house for the celebration of a j\u00e1g\u00e1, they should seize it and flee with it, but must on no account look back. Accordingly Bija and his men went to Jam-log where they found three images being worshipped with great pomp, and were told that the finest image to which the greatest reverence was paid was that of Bijat, the second that of Bijai and the third that of Ghatri\u00e1li. Bija, on the pretence that he desired to worship the images, was allowed to draw near with his companions, and they then seized the images and fled. The men of Jam-log pursued them without success, but Bija's eighteen companions looked back and perished. Bija, however, reached his house in safety, and concealed the image in his granary which was nearly empty. When he opened the granary in the morning it was full to overflowing. Bija fell senseless at this portent, and was only revived by the sacrifice of eighteen he-goats over him. Then one of the three gods took possession of a man, who began to nod his head, saying he was Bijat, the god, and could not remain in Tathwa, as it was not becoming for him to live with his sisters, so the image of Bijat was sent to Sar\u00e1han in Jubbal where it still remains. The people of Tathwa then separated, dividing their property, some going to settle in K\u00e1nd\u00ed, and the others remaining in Tathwa. The image of the goddess Bijai fell to the men of K\u00e1nd\u00ed, and is now at Batrol of Das\u00e1kn\u00e1 bhoj, while Ghatri\u00e1li remained at Tathwa and her temple was established at Panj\u00e1han in Thakri bhoj.\n\nEvery year Bijat gives his sister Bijai a rupee for sweetmeats, and whenever either of them goes to visit the other, the host entertains the guest with a he-goat, and gives him or her a rupee. Bijat always gives Bijai twice as much as she gives him.\n\nThere is a temple of Devi Jaw\u00e1la Mukhi ('goddess of the flaming mouth') at L\u00e1n\u00e1 Raw\u00e1na, concerning which the following legend is told:\u2014Mahant I'w\u00e1r N\u00e1th and the Devi met at Hardw\u00e1r, where they had gone to bathe, and, when leaving, the mahant asked the Devi when he should meet her again. The goddess promised to meet him after two years at Raw\u00e1na, and duly manifested herself in his mouth, but the mahant being unaware of her advent struck his mouth and thus caused the goddess to flee from him. Simultaneously the whole surrounding forest caught fire, and the people, thinking the mahant must be an evil spirit who had enraged the goddess, called in Brahmans who found\nout the truth. It is said that the stones are still black from the fire which consumed the forest. The place having been purified, a temple was built and a Brahman puj\u0101ri appointed. The puj\u0101ri offers incense and lhog every Sunday morning and on the first day of the month (sankr\u0101nt). The fair is held on the Durg\u0101 Ashtmi day in Asauj.\n\nNagarkoti Devi has her home at Sh\u00e1y\u00e1 Pajotha and Sharauli, and the legend states that the P\u00e1ndav\u00e1s on their way from Kail\u00e1s to Kurukshetra stopped at Sh\u00e1y\u00e1, and built a temple here for the goddess, or, as some say, brought the goddess here. The temple faces south, and on the eighth day of the bright half of the month offerings are made to the goddess. Sap\u00e1ra is also associated with Nagarkoti Devi, but the place is one of peculiar sanctity whether the goddess be present or absent from it. There is also a Nagarkoti Devi at Dal\u00e1h\u00e1n, known also as Dal\u00e1h\u00e1n Devi.\n\nBis Nana is the home of Bh\u00e1rt\u00ed Devi, who is said to have been brought from Kid\u00e1r N\u00e1th Badri Nar\u00e1in in Dehra D\u00fan. She is also called K\u00fashki Devi.\n\nThere is a temple of Devi on the hill of Lai, built by Bhera Rangar, the famous robber. Worship is performed here on the sankr\u0101nts and every Sunday and nauratra in Asauj and Chet.\n\nDevi Bhangain has a ling temple in Dh\u00e1r village, a mile north of Bhung. The legend runs that certain cowherds used to graze cattle in a forest, and their children, seeing a pointed stone, broke it in pieces, but next day the pieces had joined together and all traces of injury had disappeared. This occurred several times, and so the cultivators of Das\u00e1kna, convinced of the ling's miraculous power, erected a temple there. The Shiv Ling, four inches high and as many in girth, is known as Devi Bhangain, and is never clothed or ornamented. There is no special puj\u0101ri, and pilgrims bring their own Brahmans. The offerings consist of milk, ghi and he-goats. The flesh of the latter is eaten by the pilgrims, the head being given to the Brahman puj\u0101ri. The fair is held on different dates in As\u00e1rh, and is attended by the goddesses Bijai and Ghatri\u00e1li. Only the people of Bhojes Thakari and Das\u00e1kna attend.\n\nThe arrangements for the worship of Naina Devi at Baila are of interest. The puj\u0101ris belong to eight families of Deva Bh\u00e1ts, each family taking the duties for a month in turn and receiving a share of the produce at each harvest from the neighbouring villages. If the puj\u0101ris perform their service inefficiently and fail to exhibit in a convincing manner the virtues of the goddess,\nthey receive no dues. The Deri has no temple, but her images are kept in the house of a Bh\u00e1t. The original image when brought from Keonthal was first placed in that house, for which reason the people do not venture to place it elsewhere. The images are 15 or 16 in number, the oldest being fixed (osth\u0101pan). It is about a foot in height, with four hands, but only the bust is carved. It has a canopy of silver, and wears a necklace of rupees, silver ornament (sis-phul) on its head and a silver necklet, (gal-siri) and has also a silver palanquin. The fair is held on the R\u00e1nwi Dh\u00e1r above the village on the first three days of S\u00e1wan, and is attended by the men of Kar\u00e1l\u00ed and the neighbouring bhojes, who sing and dance. On each evening of the fair the image of the goddess visits Thauntha, Mashwa and Tati\u00e1na villages, but in the daytime it remains at the fair. It is believed that if cholera or any other epidemic breaks out in a village it can be stopped by taking the image there.\n\nThe fair of the goddess L\u00e1 is held in the jungle near Nagl\u00e1 Toka on the sankr\u00e1nt of each month. The temple is small and of great antiquity, containing a stone image of the goddess. She is worshipped by Hind\u00fas and Muhammadan G\u00fajars.\n\nAbout sixty years ago the people of bhoi Bajga proclaimed the appearance of the goddess of Tilokpur at Shak\u00far, so they built a temple to her as the new goddess. At her fairs on the sankr\u00e1nt of each month the goddess possesses a Kanet who dances in the temple, and then coming outside shows himself to the assembled multitude who hail him with shouts of jai-jai, and bow before him. In his ecstasy he prescribes remedies for afflicted men and beasts.\n\nThe goddess at Kaw\u00e1g on the dh\u00e1r of that name is worshipped by Bh\u00e1ts alone, and only Bh\u00e1ts dance in her honour. Her ritual is the same as that of the new goddess. The temple is old, and now roofless.\n\nThe goddess at Belg\u00ed is known under that name, but is also worshipped as Shnl\u00e1san.\n\nDevi Kud\u00edn has her temple at D\u00fadam in Tahsil Pachh\u00e1d. The legend is that she was a daughter of Sur Park\u00e1sh, R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Sirm\u00far, who was blind, and lived in N\u00e9ri J\u00e1gil\u00e1. When the R\u00e1j\u00e1 refused to pay tribute to the Mughal emperor the latter sent a host against him through Dehra D\u00fan, which was met by the R\u00e1j\u00e1's army under the princess herself. The Sirm\u00far forces were annihilated in the battle, and the parohit of the princess brought her head to D\u00fadam where he erected a temple, and began to worship the princess. Another version says that the princess fell in an attack on Delhi, and after her death\nrevealed to the parohit that he would find her at a certain spot, at which after a search the parohit found the image now in the temple. The fair is held on the ik\u00e1dshi before the Dew\u00e1li, on which day the image is placed on a singh\u00e1san or throne. This is also done on each Sunday in H\u00e1r.\n\nAt N\u00e1og, now in Pati\u00e1la territory, lived Lag\u00e1san Devi, the sister of Kudin. Her temple is at Kharg\u00e1on. Her fair is held on the ik\u00e1dshi before the Dew\u00e1li. It is said that she appeared at the source of the river Giri, but others say she appeared from that river at Kharg\u00e1on.\n\nAt Tilokpur is the temple of Devi B\u00e1la Sundri. There is held a large fair in her honour in the month of Chait when the R\u00e1j\u00e1 attends and a buffalo and several he-goats are sacrificed. She is as commonly worshipped by hillmen as by people of the plains.\n\nThe goddess Kat\u00e1san has a temple at Bar\u00e1ban, eleven miles south of N\u00e1han on the road to Paunta. In a battle between the R\u00e1jp\u00fats and Ghul\u00e1m Q\u00e1dir, Rohilla, a woman appeared fighting for the former when their defeat seemed imminent, and the Muhammadans were routed. The temple was built to commemorate the R\u00e1jp\u00fat victory. On the sixth day of the naur\u00e1tras in Asauj and Chet h\u00e1wan is performed in the temple, and the R\u00e1j\u00e1 occasionally visits the temple in person or deputes a member of the royal family to be present.\n\nThe Kol\u00eds and Dumr\u00e1s believe in Gugga P\u00edr's powers, and there is always a temple to him in a Koli village. But in Shal\u00e1i hamlet, in Shal\u00e1i bhoj, Gugga is also worshipped by the Kanets of the villages turn by turn to avert snake-bite, or fatal results in case anyone is bitten.\n\nThe god D\u00fam is said to have been a r\u00e1j\u00e1 of Kumh\u00e1rsain. Shirigul, deota, failed in his quest for the two colossal vessels of brass which the Turks had seized, but D\u00fam went to Delhi and boring holes in the vessels tied a thread to them, and then, raising them by the thread in one hand, sent them to Kumh\u00e1rsain with a blow of his club. So the worshippers of D\u00fam considered him to be endowed with greater power than any other god, and his cult is spread throughout Kumh\u00e1rsain, Keonthal, Balsan, Theog and Jubbal.\n\nThe god Koilo has in some villages a platform, and it is believed that snake-bite can be cured by lying down on it.\n\nA girl of Manon village was married in Keonthal, and returning when pregnant to her father's house on the occasion of some festivity, she was seized with the pains of labour while crossing the Giri and gave birth to two serpents, which fell into the stream. For some hours the serpents remained in each other's embrace.\nand then parted, one going to Tarhech, in Keonthal, the other to Dh\u00e1il\u00e1 Deothi in Sirm\u00far, where it died shortly afterwards and where a temple was erected to it. It is worshipped as Chawind deota.\n\nP\u00e1l\u00fa, the ancestor of the H\u00e1mbi khel of Kanets of H\u00e1bon and other villages, is worshipped at P\u00e1l\u00fa with great pomp. The image, which is of metal, is richly ornamented.\n\nThe temple at Pejarl\u00ed is dedicated to Bhur Singh and his sister Debi, the children of a Bh\u00e1t of P\u00e1nw\u00e1h village. When their mother died the Bh\u00e1t married again, and their step-mother during his absence from home used to treat them harshly. Once she sent Bhur Singh to tend cattle in the forest, and as on his return home in the evening one of the calves was missing, she sent him back to find it by hook or by crook. When the Bh\u00e1t reached home he found his son had not returned, and in going to search for him found him and the lost calf both lying dead at the spot where the shrine now stands. Meanwhile Debi, who had been given in marriage to a one-eyed man, was, in her mortification, returning home; she passed the place where Bhur Singh lay dead, and stricken with grief threw herself from her doli over the cliff. The brother and sister are now worshipped together as Bhur Singh. There are two temples, one at Pejarl\u00ed, the other on the high hill known as Bhur Singh k\u00ed dh\u00e1r. The puj\u00e1ris are two Bh\u00e1ts, one for Bhur Singh and one for Debi, and at the fair, on the K\u00e1tik sudi ik\u00e1dshi, no one dances save the puj\u00e1ri of Debi, and he dances by night in the temple so that the people may not see him, and at midnight coming out of the shrine leaps on to a great rock above a high cliff. Standing there for a few moments he gives one oracle, and no more, in answer to a question. On returning to the temple he swoons, but is speedily and completely revived by rubbing. Meanwhile, when the secret dancing begins the men of the Pan\u00e1l family form a line across the door of the temple, and those of the Kath\u00e1r temple rushing upon them with great violence break the line and enter the temple, but leave it again after touching the idol. As Bhur Singh is known to live on nothing but milk, animals are never sacrificed.\n\nAt Thor in Pachh\u00e1d is an ancient temple with a gilt dome which contains no image. Worship is held every evening with music, incense, and the sound of conches. Pilgrims offer walnuts, rice, etc., as they choose. The investment of the Gur\u00fa is like that of the R\u00e1j\u00e1, goats, etc., being sacrificed with worship. The present Gur\u00fa, Mayagir, rebuilt the temple, which was founded by Tw\u00e1rn\u00e1th, from whom he is eleventh in descent.\n\n1. Tw\u00e1rn\u00e1th.\n2. B\u00e1lgir.\n3. Bhawanagir.\n4.

Mayagir.\n\nDeothi is a place dedicated to a god or goddess or the abode of a god.\nThere is a legend that once R\u00e1j\u00e1 M\u00e1hi Prak\u00e1sh of Sirm\u00far attacked Keonthal, but was repulsed with heavy loss. The R\u00e1j\u00e1 on enquiry found that the Chief of Keonthal was helped by a fak\u00edr who shielded the Keonthal army with a sheet which missiles could not pierce. Hearing of this his R\u00e1ni advised him to invoke the blessing of Gur\u00fa Twarn\u00e1th\u2019s successor B\u00e1lgir. The R\u00e1j\u00e1 accordingly went to Thor and caused the mahant to accompany him to Keonthal. This time the R\u00e1j\u00e1 succeeded in subduing the Keonthal Chief, and in gratitude to the mahant, who had made the fak\u00edr\u2019s magic ineffective, told him to ask for anything he liked. The mahant said he was a fak\u00edr, and had no desires. The R\u00e1j\u00e1 offered him a j\u00e1g\u00edr, but he refused it, saying his j\u00e1g\u00edr was begging alms. Upon this the R\u00e1j\u00e1 had a bowl (pattar) made and begged alms in it. The grain thus collected was sent to the mahant with the pattar, and a general order that every house in the Sirm\u00far territory should give him a pattar full of grain at each harvesting. This pattar is of copper, round and hollow like a p\u00e1th\u00e1 (the ordinary hill measure). It is sent by the mahant to the villages to collect the grain, and is used as the royal warrant for the tax. As there was a difficulty in collecting the grain in a single pattar, the mahant has had three similar pattars made, and can now send out four men at a time.\n\nTw\u00e1rn\u00e1th and his successors are Sany\u00e1s\u00eds.\n\nGharib N\u00e1th is a well-known shrine in Paunta Tahs\u00edl on a hill of the same name, on which is a temple with two visible wells. It is popularly supposed that there are in reality four wells near this temple, but two of them are invisible except to the eye of faith. At the foot of the hill the puj\u00e1ris have built a second temple to which also five wells are attached. If a woman who is barren or whose children die in infancy, bathes in the water of these wells, her prayers are granted. The effect is more certain if the husband himself draws the water. The woman herself while on her return from the temple must not live, eat or cook in any one\u2019s house, lest she transfer her own defects to its inmates.\n\nIn Paunta Tahs\u00edl, north of the Giri and near the ancient city of Sirm\u00far, is a small stream called Sahans\u00far Dh\u00e1r, or the thousand torrents. It is the place of pilgrimage called the B\u00e1r\u00e1h-chhetar, and the three tanks, two of masonry and one of earth, which are found there, are believed to be all that remain of the twelve tanks which once existed, when the god was incarnate in a boar\u2019s form. These tanks fell into ruins and were overgrown by forests, until some 35 years ago, B\u00e1w\u00e1 S\u00edta R\u00e1m D\u00e1s, Bair\u00e1gti, discovered the place which he identified with the pools mentioned in the twelve Pur\u00e1n\u00e1s. People bathe here whenever the fifteenth day of the month is a Monday and at any eclipse of the sun. The puj\u00e1ri offers worship twice daily, morning and evening, to the gods, offering incense with the blowing of a conch and the lighting of lamps.\nThe Sikhs have four gurdw\u0101ras in the State. Of these the chief is that at Paunta, where the tenth Gur\u016b, Gobind Singh, lived for nearly five years. This gurdw\u0101ra is on the bank of the Jumna, twenty-six miles from N\u0101han, and was built by Was\u0101wa Singh, Sindh\u016bw\u0101lia, in Sambat 1882. The ruins of the fort built by the Gur\u016b still exist. The gurdw\u0101ra enjoys a mu\u0101fi of 100 bighas granted by the State, and allowances of Rs. 125 and R. 20 from Pati\u0101la and N\u0101bha respectively. It also enjoys a mu\u0101fi in Kalsia. The chief fair is held on the full moon of Ph\u0101g\u0101n (sudi p\u016branm\u0101shi), when some two thousand persons assemble, the flag-staff (jhanda) is washed and a new cover put on it. Smaller fairs are held on the Dasehr\u0101 of Jeth, the Somawati Massiya and Bais\u0101khi. The gurdw\u0101ra contains a picture of the tenth Gur\u016b and of the Five Friends (p\u0101nch piy\u0101re). The pahul is given here. The second gurdw\u0101ra is at Bhangani, eight miles from Paunta, and commemorates the victory of Gur\u016b Gobind Singh over the R\u0101j\u0101s of Bil\u0101spur and Garhw\u0101l. A bije kamb or triumphal arch was built on the site of the battle. The fair is held on the day after the chief fair at Paunta. A third gurdw\u0101ra is at N\u0101han, at the spot where the Gur\u016b once halted. It is in bad condition, but is shortly to be rebuilt. It contains a copy of the Granth, and on the Dasehr\u0101 the heir-apparent worships here, with certain ceremonies. The fourth gurdw\u0101ra is at Tokah, but it only consists of a small platform near a well, built by Fateh Singh, Ahluw\u0101lia, when he held the Nar\u0101ingarh il\u0101qa in the latter part of the 19th (Bikrami) century. About 100 bighas in the State are attached to the gurdw\u0101ra, and it also enjoys a mu\u0101fi in Nar\u0101ingarh Tahsil and an annual grant of 100 mans of grain from Pati\u0101la. The income is appropriated by the descendants of the late puj\u0101ri.\n\nBesides the gods who are worshipped for secular as well as for spiritual benefits, there are several kinds of spiritual beings in whom the people believe, such as the par\u012bs (fairies), sohars, N\u0101r Singh, d\u0101gs, and dauns. N\u0101r Singh, like the pari and sohar, is the evil spirit that causes demoniacal possession, the symptoms of which are clenching of the teeth, screaming and insensibility, and for the cure of which the Bh\u0101t has a charm invoking a number of fairies by name. While repeating this charm, the Bh\u0101t holds a branch of the sambh\u0101l\u016b tree with which he sprinkles water over the person possessed, until N\u0101r Singh enters into him, causing him to nod his head. After a while the demon makes the patient ask for a r\u014d\u1e6d (a large loaf) or a he-goat, and this is at once offered to the demon. If a r\u014d\u1e6d is given, it is placed at a spot where four roads meet, or on the bank of a stream, while if a he-goat is offered it is slaughtered and eaten or kept in the demon's name.\n\n1 From 1741 to 1746.\n2 Sohar is a god of evil spirits.\n3 P\u0101y\u0101 is a man or woman possessed of the evil eye.\nFor barrenness in a woman the sacrifice varies according as the evil is supposed to be due to possession by one or other of these spirits: thus for possession by a par\u00ed, a she-goat is sacrificed, for a sohar a khidu or hill sheep, and for a N\u00e1r Singh a kh\u00edtra or lamb which has not yet cut its teeth. The animal is sacrificed over the woman's head.\n\nDains are witches or the spirits of woman, which inflict injury in unknown ways. To avert their influence a charm is written on a sheet of paper which is held over burning incense and then tied round the arm or neck of the person possessed. These charms also contain pictures of Bhairon or Mah\u00e1n\u00e1b\u00edr (Han\u00fam\u00e1n) with a charm inscribed in a circle.\n\nAnother method of averting the influence of a d\u00e1g or dain is to call in a Bh\u00e1t or Dhaki who has a reputation for skill in such matters. He first cooks a loaf which is placed on the patient's head. Then a lamp of ghi with four wicks is lighted and certain mantr\u00e1s recited thrice, the loaf being waved round the patient's head meantime, and finally placed on the ground. A he goat is then decapitated and the blood caught in a tumb\u00e1, which, with the goat's head, is also waved round the patient's head. Lastly, the loaf, the lamp, and tumb\u00e1 with the blood and goat's head are all placed by night at a spot where four roads meet.\n\nWhereas possession by the god is, as a rule, invoked, possession by evil spirits is dreaded, and various remedies resorted to for their expulsion. Such spirits are known by various names, but Bhairon and K\u00e1l\u00ed are also believed to cause demoniacal possession. When a man becomes thus possessed, the pandit ascertains by astrology whether the possession is really due to evil spirits, and if this appears certain, he takes the man to the abode of the god. The people assemble and invoke the god with incessant cries, the puj\u00e1ri remaining still and silent for a time. Soon he begins to tremble and nod his head. He then asks the god to cure the sufferer. Casting rice at the people he curses them until in terror they offer to propitiate the god with sacrifices of goats, etc., whereupon he advises that sacrifice be made. He then offers rice to the god and says that the evil spirit will depart. Dh\u00fap is not offered, nor his music played, and as a rule, no mantr\u00e1s are read, but in rare cases K\u00e1l\u00ed is thus invoked:\n\nK\u00e1l\u00ed chari char chari k\u00e1t k\u00e1t,\nDehi ko kh\u00e1i,\nP\u00e1ni bahi samundar k\u00e1, bh\u00fat\nChurel bhasam ho j\u00e1i.\u00b9\n\n\u00b9 Lit., K\u00e1l\u00ed has arisen and devours the sacrifice. Let the ocean flow, let ghost and demon turn into ashes. [Bh\u00e1t is a male and churel a female ghost.]\nDisease is attributed to one of three causes, viz., physical, divine wrath, or possession by an evil spirit. The wrath of a god is averted by making offerings or sacrificing a goat, according to one's vow, but if a d\u00e1g be the cause of the sickness, the ceremonial is elaborate. An evil spirit is usually worshipped by night, water from seven places, earth from a public square, flowers and essences of all kinds being placed on a th\u00e1l or plate, on which is also put an earthen lamp with four wicks. The plate is waved round the patient's head and then placed in a public space, and this constitutes the chhoti p\u00faja, or lesser worship. In the greater, called bare p\u00faja, or sarsanch\u00e1n in the hill dialect, the rites are the same, but bread is also made of seven kinds of grain cooked in an inverted pan. Or in cases of illness the sick man is taken to a public square and a goat sacrificed. To propitiate Bhairon, halwa or bread made in the same way is given to a black dog, and a black goat is sacrificed.\n\nThe p\u00e1pra is the ghost of a deceased person which causes barrenness or disease, and if any one is thus afflicted a Bh\u00e1t is consulted, and he makes an astrological calculation with dice thrown on a board, (s\u00e1nch\u00ed). There the sufferer summons all the members of the family, who sound a tray (th\u00e1l\u00ed) at night, saying 'O p\u00e1p kisi upar utar \u00e1,'\u2014'O soul descend on some one,' and (though perhaps not before the third or fourth day) the p\u00e1pra or imp takes possession of a child, who begins to nod its head, and when questioned explains whose ghost the p\u00e1pra is and shows that the patient's affliction is due to some injury done by him or his forefather to the ghost, and that its wrongs must be redressed or a certain house or place given up to a certain person or abandoned. The patient acts as thus directed.\n\nAs a rule in Pachh\u00e1d and Raink\u00e1 Tansils when an old man is not cared for and dies aggrieved at the hands of his descendants, his curse is supposed to cling to the family. Whenever subsequently there is illness in the family, or any other calamity visits it, the family Brahman is consulted and he declares the cause. If the cause is found to be the displeasure of the deceased, his image is put in the house and worshipped. If the curse affects a field, a portion of it is dedicated to the deceased. If this worship is discontinued, leprosy, violent death, an epidemic or other similar calamities overtake the family. Its cattle do not give milk or they die, or children are not born in the house.\n\nA person endowed with the evil-eye is called d\u00e1g or d\u00e1gni, and to avert his influence seven kinds of grain are mixed with cow-dung and plastered on the house door, an obscure mantra being recited.\n\n---\n\n1P\u00e1pra, lit. 'sin.'\nThe hill people of Sirmur, especially those of the trans-Giri country, are divided into two great factions called S\u00e1thar and P\u00e1sar, who are believed to be the descendants of the P\u00e1ndavas and Kauravas or of their followers and disciples. These factions do not intermarry with each other, nor do they care to eat and smoke together, indeed until quite recently they were at feud with each other. Though open fights have long since ceased, the old enmity still subsists. Neither faction has any leader. Formerly all the people of a bhoj belonged to one and the same faction, but this principle is not now strictly adhered to, and though, generally speaking, the villages and communities observe this rule, there are numerous exceptions. Even the rule against eating and smoking together has almost disappeared. The menials of a village belong to the faction of their landholders. Immigrants from a village where people belong to the other faction generally attach themselves to the faction of the people of their new abode, but they are not compelled to do so, and this freedom seems to have led to bhojes being divided between the two factions. Besides this division, there are smaller parties in every clan, but they are not established factions. They rise and sink as their founders or leaders rise and sink.\n\nMen exchange pagris or topis and women the snood or handkerchief which is tied round the head, and this exchange makes them brothers and sisters as the case may be. Besides this there are several other methods of forming relationship. At Hardw\u00e1r or any other sacred bathing place people exchange handfuls of sacred water and thus become kin. Both parties enter the water and each gives the other a handful of it to drink. Hardw\u00e1r and the Raink\u00e1 Lake are the most popular places for this ceremony. A woman can in like manner make a brother on an auspicious day. She paints his forehead with saffron and presents him with some cash together with a cocoanut and something sweet, such as gur or shakar. The man returns the cash to her with a suit of new clothes. Some people give a feast to Brahmins and their relations and friends. The connection thus established is regarded as a real blood tie, and the descendants of the parties cannot inter-marry. A dharam brother cannot, without disgrace, form an illicit connection with his dharam sister.\n\nThere are several ways of taking an oath. The most important are to drink the water of Raink\u00e1 Lake, to go to a temple and have the idol bathed by the priest and drink this water together with rice offered on the image, to swear by taking a vessel full of Ganges water in one's hand, or to take an oath in the name of a god or a cow, or to say \"May I eat beef if I lie.\" Sometimes a man vows that if he speaks false, the god may kill his son or otherwise visit him with his wrath within a definite time. If he gets into trouble within the fixed period, he is proved a liar and must give a feast to the Panchayat and a sacrifice\nto the God. Besides he will have to make amends to his opponent. During this fixed period the opposing parties cannot eat or live together. If there is anything in dispute, the winning party receives it and in other cases the winner is supposed to get a present.\n\nThat is the oath of the local god or R\u00e1j\u00e1. It is used to bind a person to do, or to restrain a person from doing, a certain act. The That oath is held in awe, and disregard of it leads to certain calamity. One who breaks the oath of the R\u00e1j\u00e1 must pay one rupee four annas into the treasury, but if the \"That\" be of a \"deota\" (godling) only, the sacrifice of a goat suffices. The taking of this oath is expressed by the phrase \"deota Deota lagana, lagana\" or \"appointment of a God.\"\n\nWhen two or more parties quarrel and wish to become enemies they call a deota to witness it and from this time they cannot eat, drink or smoke together. Reconciliation is effected only by paying a penalty to the deota.\n\nWhen a man falls ill the Bh\u00e1t or deota whose aid is invoked often declares that his house, field, or other property is spell-bound or possessed of demons and in fear of them it is abandoned. No rite is observed at this time, but when the property is again taken possession of, a penalty is paid to the deota or demon, and a goat is sacrificed to propitiate the demon.\n\nA man will invoke the curse of a god upon his enemy's land or house. Similarly, a jealous husband effectively protects himself by putting his wife under the care of a God.\n\nMany are the superstitions attaching to husbandry. An auspicious moment must be chosen for beginning to plough for a crop in the rabi. This is the case with the khar\u00edf also in Tahs\u00edl Pachh\u00e1d. In Raink\u00e1 Tahs\u00edl once in a year, in Bh\u00e1don, an auspicious day is chosen for beginning to plough; a Tuesday or a Wednesday is selected and a handful of flour given to a mandar or a Brahman. Sowing must be begun on a Tuesday under an auspicious phase of the moon (nakshatra). In the case of a bijandri\u00b9 the field is not harvested by the cultivator, but is given to the local Bh\u00e1t to cut and take the produce.\n\nIn Raink\u00e1 the sacrifice of a he-goat is said to ensure a bumper crop.\n\nIf two cobs grow on one ear of maize or if a snake is killed by the plough or an ugal (spring of water) appears in the field, a he-goat must be sacrificed and its head and feet buried in the ugal.\n\n\u00b9 Bijandri (= \"not growing\"), i.e., failure of a portion of the crop on a field.\nGrain may not be used until one s\u00e9r of it has been given to a Brahman and one to the astrologer. In the Sain and Pachh\u00e1d \u00fal\u00e1qas of Tahsil Pachh\u00e1d it is offered to the deota.\n\nIn Tahsil Raink\u00e1 before grain is removed from the threshing floor 1\u00bd s\u00e9rs of it are sent to the local shrine. At the time of separating the grain from the ear one's back must be turned to the unlucky direction for the day (disa-sul and jogmi) and all present keep silence. Green grass and cowdung are placed on the wooden post in the centre of the threshing ground. A Brahman is feasted with food prepared from the new grain before other people touch it.\n\nWhen grain is carried home from the threshing ground the carrier must not face the unlucky direction.\n\nIn Pachh\u00e1d and nearly all over the country it is considered auspicious if the sankr\u00e1nt, or first day, of Bais\u00e1kh be fine, and that of As\u00e1r be rainless. On the first day of S\u00e1wan heavy rain should fall. In Magsar there should be rain, but no snow, though snowfall on the hills is welcome then. In Chet rain is wanted in the high hills, but cloudy weather nowhere. Bais\u00e1kh must be fine. In Jeth rain is not wanted. The sankr\u00e1nt of As\u00e1r must be fine. S\u00e1wan and Bh\u00e1don require heavy rain. The sankr\u00e1nt of Asauj should have rain. K\u00e1tik must be fair. Rain in this month means scarcity. It should rain in Magsar, but be fine in Posh. Rain and snow must continue through M\u00e1gh and Ph\u00e1g\u00e1n. In Tahsil Raink\u00e1 when grain is taken out of the store for the first time green grass and cowdung are placed by the store. This day must be either a Thursday or a Saturday.\n\nOn the Krishen-Chaudas or 14th of the dark half of the lunar month of Bh\u00e1don the land is worshipped. The earth of seven tibbas or hillocks, the water of seven springs, and earth from every field of the worshipper is mixed together and mantr\u00e1s are recited over the mixture. Then a little of this mixture is buried in every field possessed. In Sain and Pachh\u00e1d and even in N\u00e1han Tahsil in the month of K\u00e1tik cattle are decorated with flowers, whitewash and red colours. This is a Brahmanical custom and is not peculiar to Sirm\u00far. Trans-Giri cattle are neither sold nor purchased on a Thursday or a Sunday, nor during certain phases of the moon (panchak or mul).\n\nWhen a house is occupied for the first time a cow is tied in one corner and a pitcher of water placed in another.\n\nSome ten years ago, in 1895, the American Presbyterian Mission of Ludhi\u00e1na took up mission work in the State, but the work was carried on by Indian evangelists only, American Mis-\nSirmur State.] Food. [Part A.\n\nsionaries from Ambala making occasional visits to inspect the work of the native missionary at Nahau. The work at Nahau formed a portion of the Home Mission field occupied by the Presbytery of Ludhiana and managed by a Board of Control composed of both Indian and American ministers. In 1902 however the station was made over to the Scandinavian Alliance Mission Society, which sent out two European Missionaries to Sirmur. They have settled down in Nahau, and at present the workers include besides these two a lady missionary and two evangelists. All the Christians in the State are, with one exception, immigrants.\n\nOf the total population of the State 81 per cent. are dependent on agriculture. Cis-Giri the women immigrants from the plains do not work hard, though they grind corn and make clothes. Trans-Giri people are up before sunrise, and the men go straight to their fields or the forest. If sowing, weeding or harvesting, they work all day in the fields where food is brought to them, but if work is slack, they return home for the mid-day meal. Besides field work the men have to cut and carry home fuel and grass. Grazing is usually entrusted to boys.\n\nIn the evening they rub the body with clarified butter, take a hot bath and a meal, and settle the division of the next day's work; then they assemble in the house of an influential man and talk and smoke till late in the evening. It is the business of the men to carry grain to the mill and produce to market for sale. One who is above the average in intelligence is entrusted with the duties of shopping and borrowing or lending money, and he alone settles the village shopkeeper's or family banker's accounts. When not occupied otherwise the men spin wool or twist thread.\n\nA woman is equally hard-worked. Rising early in the morning, she goes to a spring or stream to fetch water, then milks the cows and makes butter. After that she goes out to cut grass or fuel, and on her return prepares food, which is her duty to take to the men in the fields. In the afternoon she goes out again to cut grass or work at weeding, and on her return she prepares the evening meal. She also bathes in the evening, and if any social gathering is being held, goes and joins in the singing and dancing. She very seldom spins and never grinds corn, unless she has nothing else to do. She mends and washes clothes. She works like a man in the fields, but does not plough.\n\nTrans-Giri, and elsewhere in the hills, the people eat curds or buttermilk with their food on winter mornings, and bread at night. In hot weather, or when travelling, they use makki ka\nsattu (maize flour, parched before grinding). Cultivators eat three or four meals a day. Trans-Giri, they eat g\u00e1ucati in the morning, chol\u00e1i bread and mandiw\u00e1 at noon, and rice with wheaten cake at night.\n\nThe morning meal is called jahhalnu, the mid-day one chelhi and supper bi\u00e1lu. Sattu is eaten twice or thrice a day during the hot weather, but it is used at all times in the Sain and Dh\u00e1rthi il\u00e1g\u00e1s, where bread made of maize flour is also eaten. Buttermilk and curds are always used, and meat and fish are eaten. Potande is much liked in the hills. To make it gh\u00ed is put in a hot iron pan and \u00e1t\u00e1, diluted with water, is carefully spread with the hands over the entire pan. When fried, the potande is ready for use. It is practically the same as the mande or pura of the plains; but it contains no sugar or salt. It is prepared on festive occasions.\n\nAnother standard food is uskali\u00e1n, which consists of ground rice. Potande is eaten with milk and khir (rice boiled in milk), and uskali\u00e1n with gh\u00ed and raw sugar.\n\nPotande, uskali\u00e1n and khir are festive dishes, only made at the Diw\u00e1li, as a rule.\n\nTrans-Giri the agriculturists go to their fields early in the morning after a meal of cold rot\u00ed prepared during the previous day. Koti is also sent to them at sunset.\n\nOpium and bhang are very rarely indulged in. Tobacco is most popular and is enjoyed by men and women, old and young alike. The people are also fond of liquor, both men and women being addicted to it in the Kangra il\u00e1ga. The State has removed all restriction on the sale and distillation of liquor for the benefit of the people of this part. The people distil a peculiar beverage called sur. It is less alcoholic than ordinary liquor, and according to a good hakim it is harmless and invigorating. Its smell, however, is repulsive.\n\nSur may be described as the national beverage of the people in Waziri Kangra of Tahsil Raink\u00e1. To make it the dried root of the jaingti\u00e9 or karond\u00e1 are well pounded and two s\u00e9r of the powder mixed with four of barley flour and enough water to make a large chap\u00e1tt\u00ed, which is then wrapped in leaves of the chir and bhang or hemp, and the whole is then well covered up with a blanket, so that it may ferment in the warmth. In about 20 days this cake turns red, and it is then taken out of the blanket and leaves and dried in the sun for about a week. At this stage it is called kh\u00edm. This, mixed with ten s\u00e9r of cooked chap\u00e1tt\u00ed made of mandiw\u00e1 flour, or twenty s\u00e9r of sweetened maize, is then put in an earthen vessel filled with water. After 10 or 12\ndays spirit is distilled from this mixture, the quantity given above CHAP. I. C. yielding five s\u00e9r\u00e9s of the first, seven of the second or eight of the third quality of spirit.\n\nAnother kind of spirit is made by mixing a piece of khim Food. with cooked chap\u00e1ttis made of gram or flour in a pot full of water and allowing this mixture to remain unstirred for about three months. It is then strained off and the liquid, which is red in colour, is a pure spirit called pikht\u00ed.\n\nA third and inferior kind of spirit is made by keeping the mixture described above for a fortnight only and then mixing its contents up by hand. This liquid is not strained. It is called ghaugh\u00e1ti.\n\nThe roots of the beri and bat\u00faca are also used for this purpose; in fact any of these four plants can be used to make khim. The roots are gathered and dried in Ph\u00e1g\u00e1n, Chait, Bais\u00e1kh and Bh\u00e1don.\n\nTea is extensively used throughout the State.\n\nIn N\u00e1han and cis-Giri the dress of the people does not differ Dress. from that seen in the plains. Trans-Giri a man's dress consists of a white woollen unbuttoned coat, black woollen tight trousers, and a woollen cap. A woman ordinarily wears a lehnga or petticoat ankle deep, and a kurti (miniature anga) and her head in a piece of white cloth. But for social gatherings a woman wears a white coat of fine cloth and uses for her head-dress a coloured handkerchief. Every married woman throughout the State is bound by custom to wear a nose-ring (nath) and a hair-binder (chok). Kol\u00eds and castes below them wear silver naths or nose-rings, while upper castes wear gold ones. A chok is ordinarily of silver and is adjusted to the hair a little behind the head.\n\nIn N\u00e1han Tahs\u00edl the zam\u00ednd\u00e1rs' houses are made of stone Houses, and mud, usually of one storey, and are built contiguous to one another in \u00e1b\u00e1dis, of which there are several in each village. But besides the house in the \u00e1b\u00e1di most zam\u00ednd\u00e1rs possess an outlying dwelling house near their fields, called a b\u00e1s. The cattle-shed or ob\u00e9ra is a separate building and is usually built at some little distance from the \u00e1b\u00e1di as there is no danger of cattle-lifting.\n\nTrans-Giri the houses are of a different type, being built of squared stone on a rectangular foundation, stout beams of deod\u00e1r or some other strong timber being inserted after every foot or so of stone to ensure strength. These beams run the whole length of the wall and are equal to it in width. The houses are two or three storeys high, the lowest storey being about 5 feet and the second about 4 feet in height. The latter is often used for the storage of grain, the inmates living in the third storey. The upper storeys have each a verandah\n(tung), about 2 feet broad, running round two or more sides of the building. The verandah is usually painted in bright red ochre. It is reached by stairs or, in the poorer houses, by notched beams. The walls of the topmost storey contain cupboards for household necessaries, and the whole space is often partitioned off into two or three rooms, but only one door leads out from them on to the verandah. The roof is sloping and made of slate. Trans-Giri a house costs from Rs. 200 to 1,500, and as only one mason is employed it takes from one to ten years in building. During its construction the mason is fed by the owner, and when the house is finished a panchayat decides the amount to be paid as the mason's remuneration. In the D\u00fan the houses or banglas are one-storeyed and made of mud or grass with thatched roofs.\n\nTrans-Giri beds are not used. The floor is made of planks planed smooth and the whole family sleeps on it under a single covering. In winter the door is kept shut and a fire kept burning on the hearth throughout the night, while for economy a pot of aruncolocasia roots is also kept boiling all night. In the Dh\u00e1rthi and Sain il\u00e1g\u00e1s beds are more common and in the D\u00fan their use is general. In the hill tracts mats or goat-skins are used to cover the floor. Daris made of several pieces of cloth sewn together are also used as coverlets.\n\nTrans-Giri, when the house only contains two storeys, a part of the upper room is partitioned off to form a kuth\u00e1r or dharothi for storing grain. This receptacle is often roofed in cases where it does not reach to the roof of the house. In the Sain and Dharthi tracts the granaries are made pyramid-shape of bamboo plastered with mud, n\u00e1m or other pungent leaves being placed in them to preserve the grain.\n\nTrans-Giri no rites are performed immediately before death but the followers of orthodox Brahmanical ideas give a cow to the family Brahman. No lamp is put in the dying person's hand. Four or five hours after death the corpse is put on the bier and carried to the burial ground by only two men. It is accompanied by musicians, and at several places on the road it is placed on the ground while music is played. On reaching the burial ground the corpse is placed on the pyre, prepared by the family Koli, and the nearest relative sets fire to it with a bunch of burning grass. To take this bunch one hand is stretched out behind the back and into this the Koli puts the bunch. The corpse is covered with red cloth or silk. By the pyre are placed rice, barley, milk, ght, tobacco and a hugga. Friends and relations accompany the corpse and place clothes on it. Some of the people send a few of the bones at once to the Ganges by the family Brahman who ties the bag containing them to his neck, only removing it when answering the call of nature when he ties it to a tree.\nThose who die of a wound or epidemic disease are buried. Cis-Giri Brahmanical ceremonies are performed with a few alterations, e.g., no lamp is lighted at the time of death, the dying person is made to lie on a cloth which is buried with the body, and the dying person is bathed before death. The period of mourning is from seven to seventeen days. Low caste people such as Kolis, Chamars, etc., complete the death ceremonies (kirya) on the seventeenth day.\n\nTrans-Giri mourning lasts for three, five, seven, eleven or thirteen days. On the last of these kirya is performed and a Brahman feasted. There are no Mah\u0101 Brahmans, nor is the pind ceremony gone through. If a Mah\u0101 Brahman happens to arrive within a year or so, he sometimes performs this ceremony. Generally speaking Kanets keep mourning for five days, Bh\u0101ts for seven, and Dhethis1 for three days. The family of the deceased does not eat turmeric, spices, pepper or urd (pulse) during this period and nobody takes food or drink from their hands until the mourning is over. Relatives and friends are informed of the last day of mourning, and on it they assemble outside the village and the family Brahman brings them to the house of the deceased where they give gh\u012b and grain in small quantities to the surviving head of the family and condole with him and the other members of the family on their loss. This ceremony is called paulao. After this the mourning is over and all restrictions are removed. If a sankr\u0101nt (or first day of a month) or a festival occurs during the period of mourning, the mourning ends a day before this unless the bones are being sent to the Ganges at once, in which case the period does not expire before the thirteenth day.\n\nA woman who dies during pregnancy or confinement is supposed to be apt to cause injury to her relatives, and one who dies in giving birth to a child but before it is delivered is much dreaded. In such a case the womb is cut open and the child taken out and buried separately, while iron nails are fixed in the eyes, mouth and breasts of the mother, and her feet and hands are bound with iron chains to render her powerless. When the corpse is taken out white mustard seed and embers are scattered on the road traversed by the procession. Brahmanical ceremonies are also performed at Th\u0101nesar, Hardw\u0101r and Gaya if possible.\n\nIf a person dies accidentally or suddenly, his ghost is held in awe and must be rendered powerless by Brahmanical ceremonies. It is supposed that if a bachelor (especially one between the ages of twelve and twenty) dies, his soul can be tamed and used as one chooses. The ghost of any one, but more especially of a Brahman, who is burnt on a Sunday in the bright half of the lunar month, is much dreaded. To get control of the soul one who knows the art goes to the burning ground during the night, and by reciting certain mantr\u00e1s, and performing certain ceremonies, converts the ghost into a mas\u00e1n, or obedient spirit.\n\n---\n\n1 A group of Brahmans.\nThe national game is *thoda*. It is very popular in Sirnur State. The game derives its name from *thoda*, the arrow with which it is played (Sirnauri). It is an ancient game supposed to date from the time of the P\u00e1ndav\u00e1s. The players wear black woollen caps, in shape like a Delhi jeweller's *pagri* with a silver mounted tuft of peacock's feathers worn as an aigrette. Below this, on the right side, are worn silver chains which cover nearly half the head and hang down to the ear. Bound the waist an ordinary coat or *chola* is worn, with trousers made of some thick, coarse material, such as felt, and very tight below the knee. A long heavy boot covering the whole foot and ankle is also worn. The attacking party takes a bow and arrow in his left hand, and, in his right, a *dangra* or axe which he brandishes until the moment comes to use the bow when the *dangra* is put in the belt. The bows, which are very long, are made of bamboo, and the arrows of bamboo or *oans*, but they are not pointed. The game requires two players. One of them aims an arrow at his adversary, who wards it off. The arrow must only hit the back of the leg below the knee. The defender keeps his back turned towards his opponent and moves rapidly. If the shooter misses, the parties change places, but if he hits his adversary, the winner sings a song of triumph. Throughout the game the players, especially the assailants, sing the praises of their ancestors and relatives famous for their bravery. The players become very excited when it is played between Sathors and Pasars. The following are a few of the phrases sung during the game.\n\n(Bir Singh is the assailant, Moti R\u00e1m the pursued).\u20141. *Jago ra Chunvi, chhota Sham Chand k\u00e1, Birsingh n\u00e1m mora.* 'My home is Chunvi, and I am son of Sh\u00e1m Chand, and my name is Bir Singh.'\n\n2. *Dasakni ka nalia, Bhagw\u00e1nu, Ghulabu ka chhota, K\u00e1nshi R\u00e1m n\u00e1m bati mera tu bhi chita le. Jo thia koi tu bhi j\u00e1n le.* 'Moti py\u00e1ra churi bhire ra Kathra pher tu bhi j\u00e1n le jo thia koen.' 'Bow of Dasakna, son of Bhagw\u00e1nu and Ghulabu, whose name is K\u00e1nshi R\u00e1m. Know you me? O beloved Moti R\u00e1m, who are the musk of the musk deer of the Chaur forest, you know me, what I am.'\n\n(The latter sentence is ironical. K\u00e1nshi R\u00e1m tells his adversary Moti R\u00e1m that he is like a beautiful woman, he cannot fight. Dasakna is the name of a village.)\n\n3. *Hae meri kathori.* 'Ho! my musk!'\n\n4. *Hae mera bichhua.* 'Ho! scorpion!'\n\n5. *Hat mera jhatka.* 'Oh, good shot!'\n\n(3, 4 and 5 are ironical.)\n\n6. *Thoda ka bhukha deo Bijat ka hajri.* 'I hunger for thoda; I am an attendant of Bijat.' (This is the challenge.)\nThe title of the chief is R\u00e1j\u00e1, and of his consort R\u00e1ni. Tika is the title of the heir-apparent and R\u00e1j Kum\u00e1r that of a R\u00e1j\u00e1\u2019s son, Kanwar being a male member of his family, and at present a title of little dignity in Sirm\u00far as it has become common. Bh\u00e1\u00fa is a descendant of a R\u00e1j\u00e1. This title is not officially recognized, nor is it ever recorded, but elderly people, particularly women, address a R\u00e1j\u00e1\u2019s descendant by it. The titles Bh\u00e1\u00fa and Kanwar attaches to twenty or more generations. A girl of the R\u00e1j\u00e1\u2019s family is called Dei.\n\nThe old titles of officials are of some interest. Des\u00e1val means a chief official or manager. Guld\u00e1r (a corruption of ghallad\u00e1r, lit. a store-keeper) was an official who was in charge of a waz\u00edr before the new system was introduced by the late R\u00e1j\u00e1. He was also called jamad\u00e1r. Chauntru corresponded to a zaild\u00e1r, a qu\u00e2si official in charge of a group of several bhojas. Si\u00e1na was a village headman, and a Dhimadar was his deputy.\n\nPaulia was a gate-keeper, and bhand\u00e1ri a store-keeper. The descendants of royal store-keepers are still known by this name. Bar\u00e1ti was a peon, and sanj\u00e1li, a head butler or officer in charge of the wardrobe.\n\nA family held in high respect for its bravery is spoken of as Khund and one of low status as Gwayon.\n\nTrans-Giri there are four important festivals, which ordinarily last three days. The chief day of festivities is known as S\u00e1j\u00e1. These festivals themselves are also called S\u00e1j\u00e1s, which is equivalent to the Teohar of the plains. Each of these S\u00e1j\u00e1s has its own peculiar customs.\n\nThe Bisu festival falls on the last two days of the solar month of Chait and the first of Bais\u00e1kh. The first day is Ashkalanti, the second Bashri and the third is S\u00e1j\u00e1. The Bisu fair is held in several villages, and the dates of Bisu vary in different places. The fair is held on a high summit under the flag of the village Deota. People dance, play Thoda, and feast their friends.\n\nHury\u00e1li is celebrated during the rainy reason on the first of S\u00e1wan and the last two days of the preceding month of \u00c1s\u00e1r\u2014milk and rice take a large part in the preparations of the appropriate dainties.\n\nD\u00edv\u00e1li cis-Giri is celebrated on the same day on which it is observed in the plains, but in the high hills it comes a full month after it. The first day of the festival is Ask\u00e1nt\u00ed, the middle S\u00e1j\u00e1, and the last Prainth. On this festival Kol\u00eds and Dhok\u00eds sing, dance and give farcical performances during the night in the houses of those of their landlords who have been blessed with a son during the preceding year. In return they are given presents. They also visit the villages in which girls of their own villages are married. Sometime a barricade is put on their route to close it, and unless they sing the songs specially potent to open the\nroute, they cannot go on. Those who do not know these songs return to their homes. The party who violates this rule or enters a house before sunset is liable to be fined by the Panchayat.\n\nThe M\u00e2gh festival is the greatest of all. No fair is held, but rich and poor, young and old, man and woman, celebrate it. It commences on the 28th of Poh. The first day is Askl\u00e2nt\u00ee, the second Dawl\u00e2nt\u00ee, the third Altr\u00e2nt\u00ee and the fourth S\u00e2j\u00e2. Sheep and goats that have been reared in the preceding year specially for this festival are killed on the S\u00e2j\u00e2 day. Every household kills at least one goat. Nearly the whole month of M\u00e2gh is spent in feasting and merry making. The preparations for this gay period take at least a month. M\u00e2gh is the coldest time of the year and the husbandman, forced by the climate to spend his days indoors, does his best to make them merry.\n\nBesides these four S\u00e2j\u00e2s, Janamashtmi (the anniversary of Krishna's birth day) is celebrated in the temples throughout S\u00eem\u00fbr on the eight day of the dark half of Bh\u00e2don. The celebration takes the form of a general feast.\n\nDuring the S\u00e2j\u00e2s and on the first day of every month landlords feast their Kam\u00eens.\n\nThe following are the less important fairs:\n\nRaink\u00e2 fair is held on the 11th day of the bright half of K\u00e2tak on the bank of Raink\u00e2 Lake. It is much frequented by people from the plains. Ginger, both green and dried, turmeric, walnuts and wooden utensils are sold in large quantities.\n\nTelokpur fair is held in Chait.\n\nNomayash fair takes place in October or November at N\u00e2han. It is a secular fair and was inaugurated by the R\u00e2j\u00e2 in 1900 to promote commerce. Agricultural produce and implements and other articles of industry are exhibited and prizes awarded. A horse show is also held. Hill people dance the Thoda and play their music. Lectures on social and religious topics are given. His Highness makes a speech on the last day, and fire-works close the fair. It is the largest fair in the State, and about 20,000 people attend it.\n\nThe Dusehr\u00e2 is celebrated for four days in N\u00e2han in Asauj. It opens with a private Darb\u00e2r and an elephant procession to the temple at K\u00e2li-Osth\u00e2n. On the chief day (the 10th of the bright half of Asauj) His Highness holds a Darb\u00e2r at K\u00e2li-Osth\u00e2n and a review of the State army in the Chougan.\n\nThe Hola is both religious and secular, and is held round the Sikh temple at Paunta on the day of the full moon in Ph\u00e2gan.\nCHAPTER II.\u2014ECONOMIC.\n\nSection A.\u2014Agriculture.\n\nThe diversities of soil and climate in the State are so considerable that the systems of husbandry naturally vary greatly from place to place. From an agricultural point of view the State may be divided into three distinct tracts:\u2014(1) the high hills of Tahsils Pachh\u00e1d, Raink\u00e1, and the hilly part of Paunta, (2) N\u00e1han Tahs\u00edl, which may again be subdivided into the Dh\u00e1rthi range and the khols of N\u00e1han and Paunta, (3) the Ki\u00e1rda D\u00fan.\n\nIn the higher hills few fields are allowed to lie fallow for a whole year, even the inferior soils, khil and dh\u00e1ng, which lie at a distance from the habitations, being cultivated every Khar\u00edf and, if the rains are abundant, for the Rabi also.\n\nSpeaking generally, two crops a year are taken throughout the hills. This is avoided only by those who can afford to lose the extra crop. But in the Dh\u00e1rthi a system of fallows is practised, the land being allowed to remain untilled for two or three years after a single crop. Generally the soil is fertile, and manuring is freely resorted to.\n\nThe chief Rabi crops are wheat, barley, gram, sarson, opium, masur (lathyrus sativus) and tobacco. The sowing season begins in Asauj (September to October) and ends in Poh (December to January). Wheat is sown in the hills liable to snowfall as early as September. The crops are harvested in April, May and even as late as the beginning of June.\n\nThe Khar\u00edf crops are maize, rice, sugarcane, oil-seeds, ginger, cotton, pepper, chol\u00e1i (amaranthus), mandw\u00e1 (millet, Clousyne coroocana), kulthi (Dolichas uniflorus), urd (Phaseolus radiatus), gaugati (Arum colocasea), Kach\u00fati (Arum colocasea, var.) and turmeric. Maize sowing begins in April, the precise time depending on the rain.\n\nOwing to the improvement in the means of communication the hill tracts have been opened up and their agricultural system has much improved. Cultivators, finding a profitable market, have taken to growing the more valuable crops on a large scale, and even sugarcane has been introduced, some villages producing the fine ponda variety. Owing to the conservative instincts of the hill people however it has not yet become a popular crop.\n\nThe method of harvesting in the hills differs markedly from that of the plains, in that in the hills the ears of the crop alone are reaped, the straw being left standing as it grew. The hill people carry the ears when gathered to the common threshing floor (khali\u00e1n) of the village, and they even store them in a common shed (kharoli), and have a common oven (bh\u00e1t) in\nwhich to parch sattu. Gaugati is one of the staple foods of the hill people. It is sown in June, with turmeric and ginger, and harvested from October to December.\n\nThe only crop grown for fodder in the higher hills is phaphra (Fagopyrum sativum). Cattle graze readily on the leaves of bihil (Grevia appositifolia) and other trees, so much so that in the hills no fodder crop is grown and even the wheat-straw is thrown away.\n\nNo Rabi crop is grown in land on which manduc\u00e1, urd, chol\u00e1i or kulthi has been harvested in the preceding Khar\u00edf, but any Rabi crop may be grown after maize or rice, and any Khar\u00edf crop may be grown after wheat, barley or gram. Wheat or tobacco is sown on land on which ginger or turmeric has been harvested.\u00b9\n\nIn the khols cotton is sown as soon as rain falls in June, and after gathering the harvest in October s\u00e1\u00e1n is sown in it. In the following Khar\u00edf a crop of maize is taken; and this is followed by wheat in the Rabi. In the June following manduc\u00e1 is cultivated, and after that the land must lie fallow until it can be manured again. This rotation is only practised in rich soils.\n\nThe most valuable products of the State are poppy, ginger, turmeric, rice and tobacco.\n\nPoppy is cultivated only on the high hills and on irrigated land. The land is watered and ploughed six or seven times in October; after that it is again watered and left till it becomes somewhat hard, when it is again ploughed and levelled with a soh\u00e1g\u00e1 and divided into small plots called ki\u00e1r\u00eds, to facilitate the even flow of water over it. The poppy crop is weeded and earthed up three or four times. The plant flowers in Chet or Bais\u00e1kh (March and April), and when the heads begin to ripen small deep cuts are made in the cup in the evening with a three-edged lancet, and on the following morning the opium juice is scraped off with a sharp edged piece of iron. Almost all the opium produced is exported to Pati\u00e1la, N\u00e1bha, the neighbouring Hill States and surrounding British Districts, very little being consumed locally. The Pajhota il\u00e1ga of Tahsil Pachh\u00e1d is famous for the fine quality of its opium and tobacco, which sell dearer than that produced in other parts of the State.\n\nThe tobacco grown in Sirm\u00far is of two kinds, Pah\u00e1ri and kakar. The former is cultivated in the hills. The seed is sown in Chait or Bais\u00e1kh (March and April) together with ginger, ordinarily in the kh\u00e1ls (small water channels) of a field and the seedlings are transplanted to fields specially prepared for them in As\u00e1r or S\u00e1wan (August). The growth is then weeded and earthed up thrice before it flowers in Bh\u00e1don or Asauj (September). The\n\n\u00b9 In the Dh\u00e1rthi onions also follow ginger on irrigated lands.\nflowers are cut off, as this improves the quality of the tobacco. In K\u00e1tak (November) the stalks, together with the leaves, are cut a few inches above the root and buried in the earth for ten days, after which they are dried and pounded. This tobacco is called k\u00e1taki (i.e., cut in K\u00e1tak), and is of the first quality. The parts of the stalks left uncut sprout again and produce leaves which are picked off in January, and they make the inferior kind of tobacco called t\u00e1l\u00fa, which is either used separately or mixed with tobacco of the better quality. The stalks sprout again in the spring, and the process gone through in K\u00e1tak is repeated in Bais\u00e1kh (May). This produce is called baishai (i.e., cut in Bais\u00e1kh) and forms the second quality. The plants produce tobacco leaves for three years in succession if well watered. The hill people generally grow tobacco in irrigated lands. In unirrigated lands the plants die after the first harvesting. The kakar tobacco is grown in the D\u00fan and low hills of N\u00e1han Tahs\u00edl. It is cultivated on irrigated lands and produces only one crop. The seed is sown in Maghsar (December), and transplantation takes place in Ph\u00e1g\u00e1n or Chait (March-April). The tobacco of the Pajhota il\u00e1ga is famous for its superiority, both in smell and taste, and is widely appreciated.\n\nRice is either planted or sown. The former method can only be applied in irrigated land, and is briefly as follows:\u2014The unhulled rice is washed in fresh water, placed in a pur\u00e1 (a receptacle made of m\u00e1ljhan leaves) and put beneath a water-fall for three days, after which the pur\u00e1 is put in the sun for a few days to dry the rice. The pur\u00e1 is next buried in the earth for three days. The process makes the grain sprout. The shoots are first soaked in water and then planted in fields, flooded knee-deep. Where there is a scarcity of m\u00e1ljhan trees the rice is put in an earthen pot with water and kept in the house for three days, after which the first water is poured away and the pot is refilled with fresh water and shaken. Its mouth is then tied up in a white cloth, and it is placed upside down on a big stone and left there for three clear days, when the rice plants sprout and are ready for planting. B\u00e1smati, ziri, chhuh\u00e1ra, jhinjan, magor\u00e1, magori, m\u00fanji, begam, r\u00e1mjwain and s\u00e1nthi are the kinds of rice grown in irrigated land, and k\u00e1l\u00f3n, dhol\u00e9, champ\u00e1, bolon, ujla, \u00fakhal, sandr\u00fa, banksar, ratw\u00e1, tishal, are those sown on rain land. B\u00e1smati sells dearest, and next to it come jhinjan, r\u00e1mjwain, chhuh\u00e1ra and ziri. R\u00e1mjwain is most common in the low lands and D\u00fan, while b\u00e1smati is usually grown in the hills. The b\u00e1smati of Majh\u00e1i, J\u00e1nch\u00e1, Bhainkar Kun\u00e1r and Kotla is famous for its good quality. Jhinjan, magor\u00e1, magari, m\u00fanji, kalon, sundri, banksar, ratw\u00e1 and tishal can only be grown in the high hills. S\u00e1nthi can be cultivated in unirrigated lands, but it requires a heavy rainfall.\nThe cultivation of sugarcane was introduced into Sirmur by the late Raja Sir Shamsher Prakash. In the hill tracts the same plants produce two or three crops, and of these the second is the most productive. The cane is crushed in the mills at Nahan.\n\nThe cultivation of ginger and turmeric yields a good profit. Ginger is sown in Chet in the Sain illaqa, but in the high hills sowing goes on up to Asarh (June). In December it is harvested, i.e., the roots are taken out and again buried in the earth till April when the green ginger is put in a big wicker receptacle, called dall, with a few small stones. The dall is hung on a tree and kept constantly moving for an hour, and then the ginger is put in the sun to dry and again placed in the dall and kept moving as before. It is grown on irrigated land preceded by a crop of barley or a fallow. Ginger cannot be grown in the same land for two successive years. It requires a good deal of watering and weeding. Turmeric is cultivated in the same way as ginger, but those cultivators who can afford it keep it in the ground for two years, and the root grows larger and heavier. After harvesting, the roots are boiled and the turmeric is ready for use. The ginger produced in the Dharti is the best in quality and that of the higher hills comes next, while that grown in unirrigated lands in the higher hills is not fit for making dry ginger and is only used green. In Dharti people do not store ginger for seed as their ginger sells at a high rate and they can purchase seed cheap.\n\nIn the hill tracts grass is cut and stored in October. It is gathered into small bundles and these are stacked on any open ridge or hillock near the cattle sheds, in conical stacks or pohs. The hill people divide their waste into two parts, the charand or grazing land and the ghasan or grass reserve.\n\nThe crops have many enemies. Hares and rats do much damage to the young crops and the mature crops are devastated by monkeys, hares and pigs. The zamindar requires no license to keep a gun for protection of his crops. Lightning, thunder and cloudy weather appear to be favourable to white ants which injure the gram, while westerly winds in March not only help to ripen the crops, but kill the white ants. Easterly winds in the cold weather, especially in February and March, are injurious if accompanied by rain. High winds following rain are apt to uproot plants which are in the ear or coming to ear, and in September they blow down the maize stalks. Hail not followed by rain does much damage, but if it is accompanied by rain the hail is said to act as a manure to young crops not yet in the ear. If the winter rains fail, the crops are liable to suffer much\nfrom frost and on irrigated lands they are watered to protect them from severe cold. *Darnas* or scare-crows usually consist of a black earthenware pot stuck on a stick. They are placed in fields to avert the evil eye as much as to scare off wild animals.\n\nWith the exception of the sugar mills which the N\u00e1han foundry supplies to subjects of the State at reduced prices, there has been no improvement in agricultural implements in historical times. The cultivator of a small holding can provide all the implements he requires at a cost of Rs. 5, but one cultivating a large holding, of twenty acres or so, requires a set of implements which cost about Rs. 10, and some cultivators like to have spare sets. A pair of plough bullocks can be had in the hills for about Rs. 25, but in the D\u00fan bigger animals are used and the average cost is about Rs. 50 a pair. There are no carts in the hills, and manure and produce are carried by the cultivators on their backs. A good many animals are usually kept, and these help in providing good manure. Fodder being abundant, the people have no difficulty in keeping cattle. Big *zamind\u00e1s* in the hills keep mules to transport their produce. The price of cattle is increasing slightly, but this is not much felt by the hill people. Cattle are not imported from other parts. The plains cattle (except buffaloes) do not flourish in the hills and the bullocks are useless. In the hills only small-sized animals can work in the fields. There is not work enough for big animals, and the fodder does not suit them. The hill cattle thrive on the coarse grass and the leaves of the hill trees, such as the *bih\u00fal*, a diet quite insufficient for the cattle of the plains. Bull buffaloes are not used in the hills for agricultural purposes, but in the D\u00fan the people (who come mainly from the Bist Do\u00e1b in the Punjab) use them freely.\n\nIn the hill tracts which comprise the Tahsils of Pachh\u00e1d and Raink\u00e1 and the northern parts of Paonta and N\u00e1han Tahsils, the fields are generally manured once a year, the quantity of manure varying from forty to five hundred *mans* per *bigah pakka*. The usual time for manuring is Maghsar and Poh (15th November to 15th January) when the people can, as a rule, spare time for the work. Fields for ginger, turmeric and *gaugati* are manured twice a year, once in the winter and again in As\u00e1r after sowing, and therefore about five hundred *mans* of manure are required for a *pakka bigah* of these crops. But no manure is required if wheat or barley is sown after ginger, turmeric or *gaugati* has been harvested. Maize requires about three hundred *mans* of manure, wheat two hundred and sugarcane one hundred per *pakka bigah*; no manure is required for other crops. In land in which maize has been harvested, Rabi crops of all kinds can be cultivated without manure. The land is ploughed, manured and levelled with a *soh\u00e1g\u00e1* in December or January and left lying till the time for sowing ginger, turmeric and *gaugati* in May or June or sugarcane in March. Similarly wheat land is ploughed...\nand sown in October, but in the snowy ranges wheat is sown as early as September. Rice lands are not manured. In the khols and Dh\u00e1rthi land is only manured once every three or four years. The average amount of manure per pakka bigah is a hundred and fifty mans. Wheat and maize lands are generally manured, but other crops can be sown on unmanured land or in land in which maize or rice has been harvested. For gram rice land is generally used. In the hills the chief manure used is cowdung.\n\nWood being abundant in the hills, cowdung cakes are not made for fuel, and manure is thus available. Cattle are very often kept solely for the sake of the manure they afford.\n\nDecayed leaves and herbage carried over the fields by streams in flood, and the straw of crops left standing after the grain has been harvested are natural manures of considerable efficacy.\n\nThe cattle of the hills are very small; cows give on an average from one to two s\u00e9rds of milk a day, but a trans-Giri cow is milked thrice daily, and can give on an average five s\u00e9rds a day. The cattle in the higher hills are kept in the ground floor of the house, or in separate sheds called obera, which are commonly made in or near the pasturage. The cattle are shut up in them during the night, without any one to watch them, but the sheds are carefully made secure against bears and panthers. They have small wooden doors and are warm even in cold weather. Well-to-do or industrious people keep buffaloes, but not in the house, separate sheds being built for them and the men in charge near a river or tank. These sheds are called dohchis. The man in charge milks the buffaloes and prepares the gh\u00ed. Generally all the dohchis of a village are built together. Besides the landholders, the Jamm\u00faw\u00e1l G\u00fajars keep a very large number of buffaloes, usually fine stock. They have their own camps with a lambard\u00e1r and a zaild\u00e1r of their own. In winter they live in the low hills or in the D\u00fan, but in the hot weather they move to the high hills, or into the adjacent State of Jubbal. Some of their camps are very well off and own as many as a hundred and fifty head of cattle. Their only occupation is breeding buffaloes and trading in gh\u00ed as their name denotes. They originally came from the Jammu Hills.\n\nThe hill people breed goats and sheep. A good kh\u00e1du (sheep) costs as much as twenty or twenty-five rupees, but the common animal sells for eight or ten. Sheep are kept solely for the sake of the wool, but goats are also kept for good. In the hot weather the sheep of the lower parts are sent up to cooler pastures and in the cold the Jubbal people bring their sheep down into Sirm\u00far territory.\nPonies are bred only in the D\u00fan. The State encourages horse and mule-breeding, and keeps a horse and donkey stallion at Paunta. Prizes are offered for well-bred ponies and mules at the R\u00e1m Lila fair. The District Board maintains a salotri who is constantly on tour in the interior.\n\nPigs are only kept by sweepers at N\u00e1han, and in the hill by a few Kolis. Kanets will not keep them. Though fond of wild boar's flesh, the hill people will not eat home-bred pork, and villages swarming with pigs, as in the eastern Punjab, are not to be seen. The hill people do not keep poultry.\n\nThere is no well irrigation. Even in the D\u00fan plain the water is far below the surface. The Tahsils of Pachh\u00e1d and Raink\u00e1 have plenty of k\u00fals or small water channels, but there are comparatively few in the D\u00fan. The average cost of a new k\u00fal in the Dh\u00e1rthi is forty to fifty rupees and in the high hills from fifty to a hundred. In some places the k\u00fals are made by hired labour, but the villagers generally invite their friends and the people of the surrounding villages to work on a new k\u00fal, giving them sattu for breakfast and a good meal of meat and rice, or sugar and rice, together with clarified butter in the evening. Where the spring is at a long distance from the field and the water is not abundant a pond (called khall) is made a little below the spring, and used as a reservoir for irrigation. The annual repairs to the k\u00fals are generally effected after the monsoons. State aid for repairs to k\u00fals can be obtained either in the form of tak\u00e1vi or remission of revenue for a limited period, but is not always applied for and k\u00fals are often allowed to fall into disrepair and disuse.\nSection B.\u2014Rents, Wages and Prices.\n\nZamindars in the hilly tracts settle Kol\u00eds and Cham\u00e1rs on their lands as necessity arises. Tenants get food in the morning and evening together with clothes for the cold and hot weather, and their relatives get a field rent free according to their needs. They are also advanced loans in cash free of interest at weddings and other occasions. Besides these tenants there are dhiddehis, who get cattle and implements free from the landlord, paying him half the produce of the fields they cultivate. Tenants-at-will are scarce. Besides these, blacksmiths, carpenters, barbers, shoemakers, potters, and blanket-makers, settled as menials in the villages, receive a share of the produce at harvest for their services. Blacksmiths and Badhis get sixteen s\u00e9r\u00eds of grain for each plough, shoemakers sixteen s\u00e9r\u00eds for each man and eight for each woman, and barbers five s\u00e9r\u00eds per head. Each village menial also gets a rupee or eight annas at the wedding of a boy or girl respectively. But the rates of wages in kind vary with the status of the landowners and the nature of the work. Kam\u00edns are feasted on the first day of every month and on holy days.\n\nIn the hills daily labourers are not employed for agricultural work. Kol\u00eds generally work for the cultivators in return for a share of the produce, and they are indispensable to every village. Extra labourers are required to help in ploughing, manuring and weeding, and for this the neighbours are invited, some one plays the dhol and the rest work, all receiving some sattu at noon and a meal in the evening.\n\nIn the level tracts of the D\u00fan and N\u00e1han Tahsil, however, hired labour is employed at harvest time, and paid in kind. If wages run high ten s\u00e9r\u00eds [kh\u00e1m] per head are paid, if low six or seven s\u00e9r\u00eds, but as much as twenty-five s\u00e9r\u00eds per head have been paid. For cultivators three annas a day is the usual wage, and this is the common rate for other kinds of labour, carriers being paid three annas per stage. At N\u00e1han in building work men earn three to four annas daily and women two to three annas. The Cham\u00e1rs, Kol\u00eds, Dumras and the poorer Muhammadans and Purbias work as labourers, Kol\u00eds in N\u00e1han are generally masons and earn about eight annas which is also the usual wage for carpentry.\n\nOf recent years the value of land has risen greatly in the D\u00fan, where the best fetches a hundred rupees per bigah pakka and land which no one would have for a gift some years ago is now sold at fifty. Land in the hills is not so dear, though its value has greatly increased. Trans-Giri, in Raink\u00e1 Tahsil, ni\u00e1i land sells at a hundred and fifty rupees the bigah pakka, kal\u00e1hu of the 1st class at a hundred, and obar land at from ten to fifty according to quality.\nIn N\u00e1han Tahsil kal\u00e1hu land only fetches twenty-five to fifty rupees per bigah pakka and dhar or bar\u00e1ni eight to fifteen rupees. In Pachh\u00e1d Tahsil the price of kal\u00e1hu is put at fifty rupees, and that of bar\u00e1ni at ten. In Paunta Tahsil the price of both kinds is said to vary from ten to a hundred rupees per bigah. In some places the price is as low as one rupee per bigah.\nSection C.\u2014Forests.\n\nGeologically and physically the State is connected with the Himalayan and sub-Himalayan series and the Nahan Siwaliks, being divided as regards climate and vegetation into temperate and tropical zones.\n\nThe highest elevation is the Chaur peak (11,982 feet), which is the axis of the trans-Giri system. The lowest point, 1,400 feet above the sea, is on the southern boundary. About two-thirds of the whole area of the State is occupied by forest, some portions of which form connected tracts of several miles in extent; but besides these there are many smaller, spread over considerable slopes of village grass lands. The following is a description of them as they occur in their natural divisions:\n\nA compact belt of forests twenty miles long and from one to five miles broad, containing for the most part oak, stretches across the upper western face of the Chaur spur at an elevation of between 7,000 and 11,900 feet. Besides the oaks, portions are stocked with silver fir, Himalayan spruce, yew, birch, a little blue pine (Pinus excelsa) and a few other species, while deodar occurs pure in twelve areas varying in size from ten to four hundred acres.\n\nOutside the belt at a lower elevation oak and chil are found in large and small areas and also a few patches of deodar. The forest immediately above the Giri is composed of trees of subtropical species and of low scrubs.\n\nThe Kawal stream rises on the Kawal Marri ridge which connects the Sain and Dh\u00e1rthi ridges. Several forests of chil occupy portions of the upper slopes, and two patches of oak occur. These streams drain into the Giri. A more or less open forest, twenty-three miles long and from half a mile to two miles broad, of oak associated with a few other species covers the higher slopes below the Chandpur Marolani and Haripur ridges up to an elevation of 7,000 feet. Lower down, distributed over extensive grass slopes and village cultivation, are numerous small patches of oak, three small areas of deodar and a few chil forests.\n\nThe forest tract between the Giri and the Dh\u00e1rthi ridge occupies the Sain ridge from the Giri to the Jal\u00e1l river and thence to the Dh\u00e1rthi, Nahan and Dagshai ridge. The north-east and south-west slopes of the Sain ridge are for the greater part covered with scrub jungle consisting of indigofera, Zizyphus carissa, etc. There are also a few chil areas. On the north-east slopes below the Dh\u00e1rthi ridge are several large forests of chil and a few small ones containing oak. On the lower declivities the forest for the most part is composed of scrub and subtropical trees, such as albizia, acacia terminalia, odina, odier and some sal.\nThe tract on the Ghaggar and R\u00fan streams lies west of N\u00e1han, and is fairly or densely covered with sub-tropical forest, in which are included some areas of s\u00e1l and bamboo. The tract to the east of N\u00e1han extending from the M\u00e1rkanda river to the Jumna and Tons rivers includes (1) the Kansar ridge, a continuation of the Dh\u00e1rthi spur, bounded on the north by the Giri; (2) the Ki\u00e1rda D\u00fan through which the B\u00e1ta river runs; (3) the Siw\u00e1liks between the D\u00fan and the Amb\u00e1la District. Its whole area is approximately a hundred and seventy-six square miles, of which a hundred and four square miles are uniformly stocked with pure and mixed s\u00e1l forest, three square miles with chil, chiefly on the northern slopes of the Kansar, and sixty-seven square miles excluding the areas of rivers, etc., with forests of tropical species, such as Buchanania latifolia, Eugenia dalbergioides, Terminalia tomentosa.\n\nThe Forest Department is controlled by a Conservator who has the powers of a Deputy Conservator in British territory. There are two divisions, the R\u00e1jgarh or Upper, and the N\u00e1han or Lower, each in charge of a Divisional Officer, who is usually a trained man from the Dehra D\u00fan Forest School.\n\nThese divisions are each subdivided into five ranges:\n\nR\u00e1jgarh ... { 1. Narag,\n            2. R\u00e1jgarh,\n            3. D\u00e1diu,\n            4. Haripur,\n            5. Chandpur,\n\nN\u00e1han... { 1. Kal\u00e1-Am,\n           2. Dh\u00e1rthi,\n           3. M\u00e1jra,\n           4. Faunta,\n           5. R\u00e1jpur,\n\nand each range is under a Range Officer. Each range is divided into beats, of which there are in all sixty-nine in the State.\n\nAll the forests in the R\u00e1jgarh Division, except a few in Narag range, have been demarcated, as have those in the D\u00fan. All the forests in the R\u00e1jgarh Division are classed as protected, and those in the D\u00fan as reserved, many of the latter being absolutely closed.\n\nThe management of the tea plantations is also in the hands of the Forest Department.\n\nThe zam\u00ednd\u00e1rs are allowed to cut grass and wood at half rates. The District Board and Municipal Committee manage their own forests independently, but they too are bound by the laws and regulations governing the Forest Department. The supervision of the forests made over to zam\u00ednd\u00e1rs rests with the Revenue authorities.\n\n---\n\n1 Mr. B. H. B. Thompson, of the Indian Forest Department, was Conservator from 1896 to 1901, and Mr. G. Q. Minniken, also of that Department, from April 1902-1904.\nThe only plantations are three small areas in the R\u00e1jgarh Division planted with *deod\u00e1r*, and one with cane in Simbalb\u00e1ra. The *p\u00e1n*, a climber, was introduced into the Pachh\u00e1d Tahsil, and a few plants still remain.\n\nThe settlement of the forests was made at the same time as the last land settlement, and all rights are set forth in the Settlement Records in the District Office.\nSection D.\u2014Mines and Minerals.\n\nMagnetic ore is found at Chehta, twenty-four miles north of N\u00e1han, and the mine used to be worked; but owing to its inaccessibility and the poor quality of the ore its working proved unprofitable. Its analysis was as follows:\n\n| Per cent. | Per cent. |\n|-----------|-----------|\n| Vesuloxide of Iron | 79-62 |\n| Protoxide of Iron | 14-62 |\n| Protoxide of Manganese | Nil. |\n| Aluminium | 2-10 |\n| Lime | 0-80 |\n| Magnesia | Nil. |\n| Sulphuric Acid | Trace. |\n| Phosphoric Acid | Traces. |\n| Bilsalphide of Iron | Nil. |\n| Mycroscope | 0-06 |\n| Combined | 0-23 |\n| Alumin | 1-33 |\n| Silica and Metallic Iron | 1-34 |\n| Insoluble Water | 70-52 |\n\nOld iron mines exist at Pila L\u00e1na, Khera, Sirm\u00far and K\u00e1nsar villages, but these are no longer worked. Lead used to be mined by the people at Bhatnol, in bhoj Chandu, on the southern bank of the Tons, but the mine has fallen in. A copper mine exists at Ch\u00e1ndni, one of alum in Narag, and mines of mica and marble in Joghar and in the Nahra Dh\u00e1r.\n\nOchre is mined at Hi\u00fan and Bhalar villages in Raink\u00e1 and gold is found in very small quantities in the sands of the M\u00e1rkanda, R\u00fan, B\u00e1ta and of streams in the khols, such as the Lohgar, Gumti, Tilokpur, Kh\u00e1ri, Bheron and Matar. The washers (Son\u00eds) obtain permits from the Forest Department on payment of a royalty which varies in amount. Very little gold is obtained, and the washing is not remunerative, though the gold is very pure and much in demand.\n\nLimestone is found throughout the State, and slate in ample quantities in Raink\u00e1 and Pachh\u00e1d Tahs\u00edls. The best quarry is at Bhalag in Raink\u00e1. The Forest Department levies a royalty on the slate quarried.\nSection E.\u2014Arts and Manufactures.\n\nThe foundry at N\u00e1han was started in 1867, and was known chiefly for its manufacture of weights. But as this work brought no adequate return, the late R\u00e1j\u00e1, Sir Shamsher Prak\u00e1sh, G.C.S.I., decided to make wrought iron, thus turning to account the large deposits of ore to be found in his territory. For this work he obtained an engineer from England (Mr. F. B. Jones, M.I.M.E., the present Superintending Engineer and patentee of the several types of sugarcane crushing mills now manufactured), who on arrival found this to be an exceptionally good magnetic iron ore. Machinery was got out from England, and a blast furnace was erected. Charcoal was to be used as fuel, and this of course made the iron very expensive, but as the ore contained practically no phosphorous or sulphur, the iron produced equalled the best Swedish brands, for which there was a large market in India at high rates. Unfortunately for the prospects of the N\u00e1han Iron Works, just at this time Swedish iron was replaced by English mild steel at a greatly reduced price. The idea of making wrought iron at N\u00e1han was abandoned, and the present manufacture of sugar mills was instituted.\n\nDuring the last ten years the original works have been greatly enlarged, the number of moulding shops being more than doubled. The capacity of the foundry is 75 tons a week. The pig-iron and coke are obtained from Burakar in Bengal. Sand for moulds is brought from Dera, 13 miles away, on camels. The machine shops have also been added to, and now contain some of the latest designs of both English and American machinery. They are arranged as far as possible on the modern principle of keeping the work progressing from tool to tool until they reach the fitting shops without traversing the same ground twice over.\n\nAn extensive system of standards, templates, guages, etc., is followed, so that all parts broken or worn out while at work in the crushing season can be replaced at a moment's notice.\n\nIn the smithy there are twenty-two fires and a small furnace in which three dozen roller spindles can be treated at one time. Two power hammers are in use, and a hydraulic forging press driven by an oil engine. The pattern and carpenters' shop has the usual wood-working machinery. Two Lancashire boilers supply steam for driving the works, the fuel being wood, which is brought in from the surrounding jungles.\n\nThe foundry gives employment to six hundred men, the majority of whom have been taught their trade here. Besides mills, a few lathes, planing machines, fans, vices, etc., are turned out every year, but these are put to work in N\u00e1han or sent to the foundry repairing shops in the plains.\nIf the foundry and the Jail workshops at N\u00e1han itself be excepted, there are hardly any manufacturing industries in the State. Receptacles for storing grain are made of bamboo at Tilokpur and some other places. In the hills par\u00e1ts or large platters, matkas or large vessels, etc., are made of the wood of the bar\u00e1e and kem\u00ed trees. Wooden churns are also made and sold in large quantities at the Raink\u00e1 and Tilokpur fairs. Cane furniture is also made at Amboha. Native musical instruments, coarse cotton clothes, and darris are made in N\u00e1han. In the hills woollen blankets are woven by hand.\nSection F.\u2014Commerce and Trade.\n\nWheat, gram, turmeric, dried ginger, opium, maize, rice, honey, dried pomegranate seeds, harar (yellow myrobolan), kishla timber (*Prunus armenica*), bamboo and walnuts are exported from the State. The only manufactured articles exported are the sugarcane-pressing machine and appliances made in the N\u00e1han foundry. Wheat and gram are also generally exported from the D\u00fan to Chuhrpur, in the Derah D\u00fan, which is the nearest market for the D\u00fan people, and to which they carry their own produce in their own conveyances.\n\nGrain is also exported to the Amb\u00e1l\u00e1 District, from the D\u00fan, but only by foreign traders. Surplus grain and other produce of the hills is brought down to N\u00e1han or exported to Simla, Dagshai, Kasauli and Solon, whichever is nearest to the producers\u2019 home. The hill people generally bring down wheaten and maize flour to N\u00e1han for sale, the trade being considerable at the times when the State revenue is paid. The trade of the hills consists chiefly of dried ginger and turmeric, next to these opium and walnuts. The zamind\u00e1rs themselves generally carry their dried ginger and turmeric down to Bilaspur or Jag\u00e1dhri in the Amb\u00e1l\u00e1 District, but sometimes traders buy these articles in the hills and carry them down themselves. Contractors cut logs, shafts and sleepers from the forests and after obtaining permission and giving due notice, float these down the Jumna to Jag\u00e1dhri Railway Station. Opium is exported to Jubbal and other States, and also to the plains. Opium was formerly largely exported to Ph\u00fal Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j in the N\u00e1bha State, but this trade has now greatly decreased. Tobacco is exported in small quantities as is the fine b\u00e1smati rice. Chillies are also exported.\n\nAll kinds of cloth, metal and other utensils, salt, and sugar are imported from the plains. If the harvest is a bumper one, Sirm\u00far produces sufficient grain for its own consumption, and even has a surplus for export, and grain is almost always exported from the D\u00fan. There is very little demand for imported grain in the State except in Tahsil N\u00e1han.\nSection G.\u2014Means of communication.\n\nThe nearest railway station is Bar\u00e1ra on the North-Western Railway, and this is connected with K\u00e1l\u00e1 Amb by a road which is now being metalled. From K\u00e1l\u00e1 Amb to N\u00e1han, a distance of eleven miles and two furlongs, there is a good road eighteen feet wide. There is also an excellent road between N\u00e1han and Nahna Tikar. Light carts can go from N\u00e1han to Sar\u00e1han, twenty-seven miles. The carriage road, twenty-nine miles long, from N\u00e1han to R\u00e1mpur on the Jumna is in excellent condition. For four and-a-half miles from N\u00e1han it descends, but the remaining twenty-three miles are level. A road runs from N\u00e1han via Paunta and Bhang\u00e1ni to R\u00e1jpur, and one from Paunta to Kalesar in Amb\u00e1la District.\n\nThe road from N\u00e1han to Raink\u00e1, a distance of sixteen miles, after the first four miles is only passable for mules and ponies. There is a permanent establishment for the repairs of the K\u00e1l\u00e1 Amb, Simla and Paunta roads.\n\nThe road, nine miles long, which connects K\u00e1l\u00e1 Amb with S\u00e1dhaura was constructed by the State. The establishment for its up-keep is under the control of the Public Works Department.\n\nThere is a spacious sarai of pakka masonry, with b\u00e1l\u00e1-kh\u00e1n\u00e1s on either side of the gateway, at K\u00e1l\u00e1 Amb. One of the rooms in the upper storey is furnished in European fashion. At N\u00e1han itself there is a good sarai, and also a D\u00e1k Bungalow on a spot commanding a good view of the Ki\u00e1rda D\u00fan. A Kh\u00e1ns\u00e1ma is attached to the D\u00e1k Bungalow. There is a separate sarai for the use of hill people near the spring below the town. Several temples at N\u00e1han also offer accommodation to travellers. In the temples at Paunta there is ample accommodation for Hind\u00fas and Sikhs, and a room in the Tahs\u00edl may be used by officers on circuit. The District Board is also about to build a bungalow there. At M\u00e1jr\u00e1 there is a good bungalow belonging to the District Board, and at Kolar, twelve miles from N\u00e1han, there is a rest-house. On the Simla road, twelve miles from N\u00e1han, there is a beautifully situated bungalow at Banethi. There is accommodation for travellers at several other stages on this road.\n\nThe Simla-N\u00e1han road runs by Ph\u00e1g\u00fa through Keonthal State to Bhojal. Thence to Chalha, in Jubbal and on to K\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1gh near the crest of the Chor mountain. The stages between this and N\u00e1han are Tisri, Chehta Lena (where are iron mines), An\u00fan, Pany\u00e1li, M\u00e1hipur.\nThere is only one telegraph office, that at N\u00e1han. There are Post Offices at N\u00e1han, Sar\u00e1han, Raink\u00e1, Paunta, Nahna Tikar, Sangra, R\u00e1jgarh, M\u00e1jra and Shalai. The Post Offices have, however, been made over to the British Government on certain conditions, the principal one being that Government shall maintain a Tonga Service between N\u00e1han and a Railway Station. The road between K\u00e1l\u00e1 Amb and Bar\u00e1ra is accordingly being metalled by the Punjab Public Works Department.\nCHAPTER III.\u2014ADMINISTRATIVE.\n\nSection A.\u2014Administrative Divisions.\n\nThe old administrative divisions were called *waziris*. These were twelve in number, and their names were as follows:\n\n| Tahsil | Tahsil |\n|--------|--------|\n| N\u00e1han | Faunta |\n| 1. Dh\u00e1rthi. | 1. D\u00fan. |\n| 2. Khol. | 2.

Sain. |\n\nEach of these *waziris* consisted of several *bhojes* which were further sub-divided into *b\u00e1ses*. The statement below gives the *bhojes* in each Tahsil:\n\n| Tahsil | Bhojes |\n|--------|-------|\n| N\u00e1han | (1) Sar\u00e1han. |\n|       | (2) Porli. |\n|       | (3) Dand\u00e1. |\n|       | (4) J\u00e1tak. |\n|       | (5) Panj\u00e1b\u00e1l. |\n|       | (6) Jh\u00e1jar. |\n|       | (7) Kath\u00e1na. |\n|       | (8) Naoni. |\n|       | (9) Sall\u00e1r\u00f3\u00ed. |\n|       | (10) Mogi-Nand. |\n|       | (11) Dandor. |\n|       | (12) Gird-Naw\u00e1b. |\n|       | (13) Baj\u00e1hara. |\n|       | (14) Barhm\u00e1-Bh\u00fad. |\n|       | (15) B\u00e1rtthal. |\n|       | (16) Jamli. |\n|       | (17) B\u00e1gerat. |\n|       | (18) Nab\u00e1w\u00e1g. |\n|       | (19) Maidh\u00e1r. |\n|       | (20) Jhh\u00e1la. |\n|       | (9) Haripur. |\n|       | (10) M\u00e1lgi. |\n|       | (11) Lohgarh. |\n| Faunta | (1) Kathw\u00e1r. |\n|        | (2) Korgah. |\n|        | (3) Sakh\u00e1oli. |\n|        | (4) Girip\u00e1r. |\n|        | (5) K\u00e1m\u00e1ru. |\n|        | (6) Au. |\n|        | (7) Korla. |\n|        | (8) D\u00fan. |\n|        | (18) Keontan. |\n|        | (19) Dh\u00e1mla. |\n|        | (20) Gh\u00e1t. |\n|        | (21) Mohanaki. |\n|        | (22) Bohari. |\n|        | (23) Thalera. |\n|        | (24) Chamrog. |\n|        | (25) Bhajcra. |\n|        | (26) Tiparya. |\n|        | (27) Dh\u00e1rthi. |\n|        | (28) Gharar. |\n|        | (29) Khalog. |\n|        | (30) Pargiy\u00e1l. |\n|        | (31) M\u00e1ndhar. |\n|        | (32) Goshain. |\n|        | (33) H\u00e1ban. |\n|        | (34) Diman. |\n|        | (35) Bakhog. |\n|        | (36) Badhor\u00ed. |\n|        | (37) Sarasbh\u00e1rag. |\n|        | (38) Babelgi. |\n|        | (39) Sarsh\u00e1n. |\n|        | (40) Bajga. |\n|        | (41) Bhelan-Kh\u00e1s. |\n|        | (42) M\u00e1rsary\u00e1. |\n|        | (43) Sheli. |\n|        | (44) Dharoli. |\n|        | (45) Panjerl\u00ed. |\n|        | (46) P\u00e1ori. |\n|        | (47) Shial. |\n|        | (48) M\u00e1ngan. |\n|        | (49) Shilli. |\n| Pachh\u00e1d | (1) Dadbog. |\n|         | (2) Chagroti. |\n|         | (3) Chehta. |\n|         | (4) Salsatho. |\n|         | (5) R\u00e1iki. |\n|         | (6) Sangr\u00e1h. |\n|         | (7) Sh\u00e1ma. |\n|         | (8) P\u00f3m\u00e1r. |\n|         | (9) Gandhori. |\n|         | (10) Bhaw\u00e1i. |\n|         | (11) Das\u00e1kana. |\n|         | (12) Tikri. |\n|         | (13) S\u00e1nghna. |\n|         | (14) Ganog. |\n|         | (15) Senj-Salora. |\n|         | (16) Ludh\u00e1na. |\n|         | (17) Raj\u00e1na. |\n|         | (18) Ch\u00e1ma. |\n|         | (19) D\u00e1m\u00e1n. |\n|         | (20) Nam\u00e1su. |\n|         | (21) Kar\u00e1l\u00ed. |\n|         | (22) Jail. |\n|         | (23) Sharg\u00e1o. |\n|         | (24) Hal\u00e1l\u00e1n. |\n|         | (25) Banog. |\n|         | (26) Sangt\u00fa. |\n|         | (27) Nen\u00eddh\u00e1r. |\n|         | (28) Jhak\u00e1ndaun. |\n|         | (29) Chandah. |\n|         | (30) Shil\u00e1. |\n|         | (31) Mast. |\n|         | (32) Ghandw\u00e1r. |\n|         | (33) Shila. |\n|         | (34) J\u00e1m\u00fan. |\n|         | (35) N\u00edbar. |\n|         | (36) K\u00e1chhiy\u00e1. |\n|         | (37) M\u00e1hipur. |\n|         | (38) Sanorah. |\n|         | (39) Ratank. |\n\nAn official called *guldar*, a corruption of *ghal\u00e1d\u00e1r* (literally a store-keeper of grain) was in charge of each *waziri*. He was also called *jamand\u00e1r*, and had a *bar\u00e1t\u00ed* or *chapr\u00e1si* under him. These officials often used to live in the capital and visit their charges when they pleased. Each *bhoj* had a *si\u00e1na* or headman and over each group of two or more *bhojes* there was a *chontr\u00fa* or *zaild\u00e1r*. A *si\u00e1na* had a *dhim\u00e9d\u00e1r* as his deputy, but the latter was not recognized as a public servant.\nThe whole State is now divided into four Tahsils which are further divided into zails, patw\u00e1r circles (halk\u00e1s) and mauzas.\n\nThe zails are as follows:\n\n| Tahsil | Zail |\n|--------|------|\n| N\u00e1han | 1.

The remaining members, who are all nominated, are Major Vir Virkrama Singh, Kanwar Ranzor Singh, Mr. R. Warburton, Sard\u00e1r Nar\u00e1in Singh, and B\u00e1bu Bishambar D\u00e1s. In the event of his being absent from the State, the R\u00e1j\u00e1 nominates a President. The President with three members form a quorum, and the decision of the Council is that of the majority of the members. The President and members each send their opinions in writing, separately, to the Secretary to the Council who compiles the judgment from them, the opinion of the majority being followed. This judgment, having been signed by the President and the members, is pronounced in open court. The Council only exercises appellate powers.\n\nThe court of His Highness, sitting alone, is called the Ijl\u00e1s-i-Kh\u00e1s, and exercises the functions of the Chief Court and of a Divisional Court in the Punjab. Appeals lie from this court to the Judicial Council. Below it is the court of the District Judge, and subordinate to the latter are a Munsif with 2nd class powers at N\u00e1han and an Honorary Munsif (Kanwar Ranzor Singh). The Tahsild\u00e1rs are also Munsifs, but have only power to hear cases of the nature of Small Causes, up to the value of Rs. 15.\n\nThe Hindu Law does not recognize pre-emption, and no such custom appears to have been enforced in Sirmur until the Punjab Laws Act (IV of 1872) was made applicable to the State by the late R\u00e1j\u00e1. Since that Act was introduced it appears that authoritative decisions recognizing the existence of such a custom have been passed by the State courts.\n\nThe Indian Penal Code and Code of Criminal Procedure are in force. The Criminal Courts are organised as follows. The highest tribunal is the Judicial Council which has already been described. The court of His Highness sitting alone is called the Ijl\u00e1s-i-Kh\u00e1s, and it exercises the functions of the Chief Court and of a Sessions Court in the Punjab. Appeals lie from this court to the Judicial Council. Below the Ijl\u00e1s-i-Kh\u00e1s is the court of the District Magistrate and below that again the courts of the Tahsild\u00e1rs, who exercise the powers of 2nd Class Magistrates. There is also an Honorary Magistrate exercising 2nd Class powers.\n\nThere were no regular courts in Sirmur before the accession of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Sir Shamsher Parkash who introduced the new system which has been remodelled by the present ruler.\nLegal practitioners are admitted to practice before these courts, both civil and criminal, and petition-writers are licensed according to the rules framed by the Chief Court of the Punjab. Persons who have passed the examinations of that Court are admitted to practise as legal practitioners and petition-writers without re-examination in the State. There are six pleaders, all of the first grade, regularly practising at N\u00e1han, and twelve petition-writers, five at N\u00e1han, three at Paunta and two at Pachh\u00e1d and Raink\u00e1.\n\nThe Indian Registration Act is in force. The District Magistrate and Collector is Registrar, and the Tahsild\u00e1rs at N\u00e1han, Paunta, Raink\u00e1 and Sar\u00e1han are Sub-Registrars.\nSection C.\u2014Land Revenue.\n\nBefore Sambat 1870 B. (A.D. 1813) the revenue of the State was collected in two ways, called in the Pah\u00e1ri dialect k\u00e1r\u00e1 and k\u00e1ila, k\u00e1r\u00e1 meaning cash revenue and k\u00e1ila revenue in kind. The unit was the k\u00e1in, i.e., the amount of land which could be sown by a given amount (usually four kachcha mans) of seed-grain. This unit however was not constant, as the area which can be sown with a given amount of seed varies with the productivity of the soil. Moreover the k\u00e1in itself varied, being sometimes five or even six kachcha mans in capacity. The k\u00e1in unit was however uniformly assessed at one rupee in cash or two kachcha mans of grain in kind.\n\nIn 1883 B., during the reign of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Fateh Park\u00e1sh, a cash assessment was first imposed throughout the State, except in the khols of Haripur and N\u00e1han, where revenue in kind was collected by the bhand\u00e1ri. The State demand was fixed at one-sixth of the gross produce, with the addition of a b\u00e1chh or extra cess on each k\u00e1in of land.\n\nIn 1902 B. the bat\u00e1i system was abolished in the two khols mentioned above, and they too were assessed at a cash revenue. In 1902 B. the revenue of 1883 B. was increased by 20 per cent.\n\nThe first Regular Settlement was carried out under the orders of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Sir Shamsher Pr\u00e1k\u00e1sh in 1935 B., the assessment being fixed for a period of fifteen years. The whole State was surveyed and regular revenue records drawn up. At this settlement, in addition to the revenue demand, lambard\u00e1ri, and patw\u00e1r cesses and local rates were imposed. The State was then divided into four Tahs\u00edls, N\u00e1han, M\u00e1jra, Pachh\u00e1d and P\u00e1lwi (Raink\u00e1). The settlement operations met with considerable opposition in Raink\u00e1, fostered by certain officials who thought their interests threatened under the old r\u00e9gime. The zam\u00edn-d\u00e1rs were ignorant of the precise amount of the demand and were mere puppets in their hands.\n\nThe second Regular Settlement was commenced in 1944 B. under the direction of R\u00e1\u00ed Parmeshari Sah\u00e1i, a retired Superintendent of Settlement in the United Provinces, and completed in 1949 B. The zam\u00edn-d\u00e1rs offered no opposition to it. Only Tahs\u00edls Paunta and N\u00e1han and waz\u00edr\u00eds Sain (partly in Tahs\u00edl Pachh\u00e1d and partly in Raink\u00e1) and Karl\u00ed in Tahs\u00edl Raink\u00e1 were re-surveyed, zaild\u00e1rs were appointed and the cesses were increased by one per cent. for zaild\u00e1ri dues.\nThe cesses finally sanctioned were as follows:\n\n| Land Revenue | Rs. A. |\n|--------------|-------|\n| Patw\u00e1r       | 6 8   |\n| Lambard\u00e1ri   | 5 0   |\n| Za\u00edld\u00e1ri     | 1 0   |\n| Local Rate   | 12 8  |\n\nTotal ... 25 0\n\nThe revenue at this Settlement was enhanced by 50 per cent, this increase being based on several considerations:\u2014(1) the increase of the cultivated area, (2) the rise in prices, (3) the colonization of the D\u00fan il\u00e1qa, and (4) the development of irrigation due to the increase in the number of k\u00fals. The State demand was maintained at one-sixth of the gross produce. To arrive at a fair assessment the average of the following four estimates of produce was accepted:\u2014(1) the produce estimated by the samind\u00e1rs of the chak, (2) that estimated by Tahs\u00edld\u00e1rs, (3) that arrived at by an appraisement (kank\u00fat) of selected fields, and (4) the estimates accepted at the previous settlement. The part\u00e1 rates varied in different places according to the degree of productiveness of the land and the quality of the produce. Further, owing to the rise in prices, the part\u00e1 rates of the previous settlement were slightly increased. But the most important factor in enhancing the revenue of the State was the colonization of the D\u00fan il\u00e1qa. In 1938 B. the attention of the R\u00e1j\u00e1 was directed to the scheme, and the tract was colonized by Bhatis, Sain\u00eds and J\u00e1ts of the Hoshi\u00e1rpur and Jullundur Districts and of the R\u00fapar Tahs\u00edl in Amb\u00e1l\u00e1. These sturdy and industrious people had very small holdings in their own districts, and as they were granted land on very favourable terms by the State, they rapidly colonized the D\u00fan. At the first Regular Settlement the cultivated area of Tahs\u00edl Paunta was only 20,775 bigahs pakka, most of it being barren waste, and the number of cultivators was small. The cultivated area is now (1902) 33,016 bigahs pakka, and though the value of land has also risen considerably, the number of pre-emption suits shows that competition for the land is keen. A new canal taking out from the Giri, a little above Sirm\u00far, the old capital, is now under consideration, and it is expected that this will increase the productivity of the tract considerably.\n\nAt the first Regular Settlement the State was divided into estates (mauz\u00e1 or ilh\u00e1g), each comprising several b\u00e1ses. The small size of the mauzas caused inconvenience both to the revenue officials and the people, so at the second Regular Settlement the mauzas were enlarged. The number of patw\u00e1r\u00eds was increased, and the headmen, who used to get fixed sums by way of remuneration, were now given a pachotra of 5 per cent. on the land revenue, according to the rules under Act XVII of\n1887, and made responsible for the collection of the State revenues.\\(^1\\)\n\nIn order to increase the number of k\u00fals the State decided to levy no water-rate for two years on every new k\u00fal which had cost less than one hundred rupees, and for five years on those which had cost more.\n\nThe land revenue was to be collected in four instalments, viz., on the 15th As\u00e1r and 15th S\u00e1wan in the Rabi and on the 15th Manghsar and 15th Poh in the Khar\u00edf.\n\nThe land in the State being of very different qualities and productive power, each Tahsil was divided into several chaks or assessment circles: N\u00e1han into five, Paunta and Raink\u00e1 into six each and Pachh\u00e1d into seven.\n\nSome common land is attached to every village, and where the village is divided into separate pattis each patti has its own common land. Every resident of the village or patti has the right to cut grass or fuel and to graze cattle in it. In the hills two kinds of lands are set aside for grass and attached to each village, viz., (1) char\u00e1nd, i.e., grazing land, (2) gh\u00e1san, i.e., land on which grass is grown but which is not used for grazing, the grass being cut and stored for use during the winter or rainy season. The zamind\u00e1rs are allowed to graze cattle or cut grass and trees for fuel in the zamind\u00e1ri forests, but wood for building purposes may be cut only with permission of the Collector. In villages where there is no zamind\u00e1ri jungle the zamind\u00e1rs are allowed to graze cattle or cut trees for fuel in the unreserved forests. In all unreserved State forests agriculturists are exempted from payment of half the grazing dues.\n\nThe malbah is not realized in cash. In the hills the amount required for expenditure in the common interest is collected by a b\u00e1chh or contribution realised in equal shares\\(^2\\) from every family in the bhoi, and not according to the area of land held or the amount of land revenue paid. When any article is needed it is generally collected in kind by a b\u00e1chh, cash being seldom collected and only on special occasions. Collections are generally made for feeding fak\u00edrs or holy men, and for celebrating festivals. Cash is also collected by b\u00e1chh to meet the expenses of cases relating to common interests or for the construction of temples. There being no bhojes in the D\u00e1n il\u00e1ga, the villagers arrange the amount of contribution (or b\u00e1chh) among themselves, but in the hill tracts the lambard\u00e1rs or dhim\u00e9d\u00e1rs have this respon-\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The lambard\u00e1rs were also made responsible for maintaining correct registers of all marriages, and for reporting them to the Tahsil. As remuneration they receive a rupee at each marriage and annas eight for each r\u00edt.\n\n\\(^2\\) The more important families pay a larger share.\nsibility. *Lambard\u00e1rs* in the plains have power to incur all expenditure necessary for the community. Money or grain is borrowed from some shop agreed upon, and the sum realized afterwards from the land-owners in proportion to the land revenue paid. *Dhim\u00e9d\u00e1rs* (Deputy *lambard\u00e1rs*) collect revenue under the supervision of the *lambard\u00e1rs* and perform their duties in their absence.\n\nAll income derived from the common land, *viz.*, from contracts for grass, sale of fuel, timber, etc., is divided by the owners among themselves.\n### Rates of Revenue in Sirmur State\n\n| Name of Tahsil | Kalahu salana, irrigated throughout the year | Kalahu shashwahi, irrigated in autumn and winter only | Obar khadi, unirrigated but manured | Obar phair-khadi, unirrigated unmanured | Khil, inferior | Jadil, new | Arable |\n|----------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------|-----------|--------|\n| Nahan          | Rs. 1-10 to 2-0                             | Rs. 1-4 to 1-8                                       | Rs. 1-1 to 1-4                     | As. 12 to Re. 1                        | As. 5 to 8    | As. 7 to 12 | As. 3 to 6 |\n| Faunta         | Rs. 1-10 to 1-12                            | Rs. 1-4 to 1-8                                       | Rs. 1-0 to 1-6                    | As. 10 to Re. 1                       | As. 6         | As. 8 to 12 | As. 3 to 6 |\n| Rink\u00e1          | Rs. 2-4 to 3-0                              | Rs. 1-14 to 2-10                                     | Rs. 1-2 to 1-1-14                 | As. 12 to Rs. 1-2-3                   | As. 10-6 to 12| As. 10-6 to 12| As. 3     |\n| Pachhad        | Rs. 1-14 to 3-12                            | Rs. 1-8 to 2-10                                      | Rs. 1-2 to 2-4                    | As. 12 to Rs. 1-8                     | As. 6 to 12   | As. 6 to 12 | As. 3     |\n\n**Note:** These rates are for a *bigah pukhta*. Both the minimum and maximum rates are given, as the rates vary in different villages according to the fertility and character of the soil.\nGenerally speaking the soil of this Tahs\u012bl, which on the south adjoins the Amb\u0101la District, is sandy and stony. It comprises the 5 chaks shown in the margin. The Dh\u00e1rthi Dh\u00e1r and N\u00e1han khols lie wholly within it. With the exception of a small portion irrigated by the Giri and Jal\u00e1l which flow along its borders and the M\u00e1rkanda which flows through it, it is almost entirely dependent on the rainfall. The zamind\u0101rs are of an inferior class, and the people living round N\u00e1han itself make more by selling grass and fuel than by cultivation. In the vicinity of N\u00e1han self-cultivating owners are few, and most of the land is cultivated by tenants. These are mostly G\u00fajars in the part adjoining Amb\u0101la and Kanets in the Dh\u00e1rthi, but tenants are difficult to obtain, and land is often left fallow in consequence. Steps have been taken by the State with good results to prevent tenants being enticed away by one proprietor from another. Sugarcane, ginger and turmeric are grown on the banks of the Jal\u00e1l and Giri, and mango trees are plentiful.\n\nChak K\u00e1nsar,\n\nChak K\u00e1nsar in the Dh\u00e1rthi, though hilly, is the richest chak in the Tahs\u012bl, and pays a rate two annas higher than the rest. 24\u00b78 per cent. of its area is irrigated by the Giri and other streams, and 65\u00b72 of it is cultivated by the Kanet proprietors themselves, there being few tenants, and occupancy tenants only cultivate 10\u00b75 per cent. Kol\u00eds are the principal tenants.\n\nChak Panj\u00e1hal,\n\nChak Panj\u00e1hal on the Dh\u00e1rthi range, adjoining N\u00e1han, is also hilly and of average fertility, with some irrigation from kh\u00e1ls or natural torrents. It is assessed at the same rate as the Dh\u00e1rthi il\u00e1ga, and below that of K\u00e1nsar or Jhajar. The owners are Bh\u00e1ts, Kanets and Kol\u00eds, and generally indifferent cultivators. Owners cultivate 60\u00b78 per cent. of the area under cultivation. Only 16\u00b712 per cent. of that area is irrigated; cultivation is dependent on the rainfall and the people are not well off.\n\nChak Dh\u00e1rthi,\n\nThe soil of the Dh\u00e1rthi chak is bad, and there is little irrigation, only 10 per cent. of the cultivated area being scantily watered by hill torrents. The rate on irrigated land is only 45 per cent. of that paid in K\u00e1nsar chak. Only 48 per cent. of the area is cultivated by the owners themselves who are poorly off, and 10 per cent. by occupancy tenants. Kanets, Bh\u00e1ts and Kol\u00eds are the principal cultivators. The chak lies in the hills on the road to Simla.\n\nChak Baj\u00e1hra,\n\nChak Baj\u00e1hra comprises some khols and is traversed by the M\u00e1rkanda, Sail\u00e1ni Nadi and R\u00fan, which irrigate less than 10 per cent. of its area. Its produce is, however, excellent,\nand the irrigated area pays twice the rate imposed in all the other chaks, except K\u00e1nsar. As a whole the chak equals Nar\u00e1in-garh Tahsil in fertility, and the people are fairly well-to-do. Many of its villages are held by officials of the State. The people also sell grass, wood and milk in N\u00e1han. Only 15\u00b73 per cent. of the area is cultivated by occupancy tenants.\n\nJh\u00e1jar, a rugged uneven chak, adjoins Baj\u00e1hra and the Kot\u00e1ha il\u00e1qa of Amb\u00e1l\u00e1. It contains some khols. More than half the area is cultivated by tenants, and 10\u00b78 per cent. is held by those who have rights of occupancy. 20\u00b74 per cent. is irrigated, and the rate assessed is the same as that in Panj\u00e1hal and Dh\u00e1rthi, but lower than in K\u00e1nsar or Baj\u00e1hra as the supply of water is smaller. The cultivators are Kanets, Bh\u00e1ts and Kol\u00eds with some Path\u00e1ns, Jog\u00eds and Bagg\u00e1ls.\n\nPaunta Tahsil contains 169 villages, distributed as shown in the margin. It comprises three natural divisions,\u2014the D\u00fan plain, the hill tract and the Haripur khol. Of these the D\u00fan is the most productive, being watered by the Giri and B\u00e1ta rivers. Hill torrents also irrigate parts of the khol and hill tracts. In the D\u00fan the land of the P\u00e1rd\u00fani tract, which is under the Forest Department, is very fertile, but it is not cultivated. N\u00e1li Khera is a very rich tract in the D\u00fan, but it receives no irrigation, and even its cattle have to be watered at the Jumna. A few wells exist in the D\u00fan, but the supply is short in the hot weather. Though the Giri traverses the Tahsil, there is little irrigation from it. There are extensive s\u00e1l forests. The people of the Tahsil are well off. Since the former settlement the cultivated area has largely increased, as already noted, and owing to this and the rise in prices its revenue was trebled at the current settlement.\n\nChak Har\u00edpur lies in the midst of the forest of Har\u00edpur khol adjoining Jag\u00e1dhri Tahsil. It is less stony than the Pah\u00e1ri chak, but more so than the D\u00fan. Parts of it are level, parts uneven, and its soil is generally full of stones, but more productive than the D\u00fan or N\u00e1li Khera. The cultivators include many G\u00fajars. Fuel and grass is abundant, and the chak pays a rate 50 per cent. above that of the D\u00fan, and slightly in excess of that levied in the hills.\n\nThe D\u00fan chak is almost a level plain, extending from Kolar village between the hills up to the B\u00e1ta, by which some part of it is irrigated. It is a fertile chak, though part of it is stony. The cultivators include Banj\u00e1r\u00e1s, Jats, Sain\u00eds and Baht\u00eds from Hoshi\u00e1rpur and Jullundur Districts and Tahsil R\u00fapar. These\ncolonists are well off, and most of them are land-owners, who cultivate 49\u00b72 per cent., occupancy tenants only holding 1\u00b73 per cent. Only 6\u00b77 per cent of the cultivated area is irrigated, and the assessed rates are much below those of the hill chaks; few valuable crops being grown.\n\nChak N\u00e1li Khera is also level, lying between the hills and the Jumna. It is intersected by the Giri from the north. Paunta lies within it. The surface is irregular and covered with hillocks, but the soil is productive. N\u00e1li Khera proper, between Tibba Gharib N\u00e1th and the Jammu Kh\u00e1la range, has no wells, and elsewhere wells are only used for drinking water. Wells have a limited supply and run dry in the hot weather, when cattle have to be watered at the Jumna. Only 3\u00b79 per cent. of the area is irrigated from the Giri and B\u00e1t\u00e1. 63\u00b712 per cent. is cultivated by owners, and 6\u00b79 by occupancy tenants. The cultivators are the same as those in the D\u00fan, and the rates of assessment slightly higher on irrigated, but lower on b\u00e1r\u00e1ni land than in the D\u00fan.\n\nThe chak Girip\u00e1r contains ten villages and lies between the Giri and the Jumna. It is more level than the N\u00e1li Khera and D\u00fan chaks, and consists of kh\u00e1dir land, which is not very fertile. Wheat, gram and til are the chief crops. The cultivating castes are the same as in the N\u00e1li Khera and D\u00fan, but self-cultivating peasant owners only hold 24 per cent. and tenants 13 per cent. of the cultivated area, the rest being owned by Sard\u00e1r S\u00farat Singh and other large proprietors. A considerable area is irrigated by k\u00fals, and the supply of water is more abundant than in the D\u00fan or N\u00e1li Khera. Owing to the proximity of the forests, grazing is abundant and many cattle are kept. Some Ranghars also own land in this chak. The cultivating classes are well off. Produce is sold in Dera D\u00fan and Amb\u00e1l\u00e1 and the chak, like the N\u00e1li Khera and D\u00fan, is open to cart traffic.\n\nChak Korla is a hilly circle lying across the Giri, and about 12 per cent. of its area is irrigated by kh\u00e1ls. G\u00e1tu, one of its villages, is a health resort for Paunta Tahs\u00edl, and the Tahs\u00edd\u00e1r has his head-quarters there during the rains. Turmeric, ginger and other hill crops are grown, the cultivating classes being Kanets, Bh\u00e1ts and Kol\u00eds. Cultivating owners hold 33 per cent. and occupancy tenants 3 per cent. of the cultivated area. Irrigated land pays the highest rate in the State, but b\u00e1r\u00e1ni pays As. 1\u00b79 a bigah less than similar land pays in the hill tracts. The circle is surrounded by forests. The people are moderately well-to-do.\n\nThe Pah\u00e1ri or hill chak comprises 52 villages in the Tons, no less than 29 per cent. of the cultivation being irrigated. Turmeric and ginger are grown in all the villages, except those\nat the base of the hills, the leaves of the b\u0101n trees which grow along the kh\u0101ls being used for manuring the latter crop. Sugarcane is grown in Ch\u0101ndni village. Gum is produced by the j\u0101gu tree. More than 51 per cent. of the cultivated area is held by self-cultivating owners, occupancy tenants only holding 6 per cent. The assessment rates are as high as those in Haripur, and the people are well-to-do. The tracts round Ch\u0101ndni and Ratewaha, both owned by Kanwar Rand\u012bp Singh, are especially fertile.\n\nTahs\u012bl Raink\u0101 lies to the north of Tahs\u012bl N\u0101han. It consists of six chaks\u2014Karli, Sain, Sangrah, Bhawai, K\u0101ngra (I) and K\u0101ngra (II). The soil is fertile and the people are comparatively rich. The revenue demand was increased by 50 per cent. at the last settlement. The Giri river flows for a considerable distance through the Tahs\u012bl, but irrigates only a small area. The greater part is owned by Kanets and Bh\u0101ts; a little by Kol\u012bs. The chief products are rice, ginger, turmeric, wheat, maize, walnuts and opium.\n\nOf the chaks, Karli is the most fertile. 70 per cent. of the whole area is cultivated by the owners themselves, while tenants with rights of occupancy possess 7 per cent. 59 per cent. of the area is irrigated. The rate of revenue is 40 per cent. higher than the rate in Paunta Tahs\u012bl on irrigated land and 30 per cent. higher on unirrigated.\n\nThe soil of chak Sain produces rice of the best quality. 40 per cent. of the area is irrigated. Owners cultivate 51 per cent. of the whole cultivated area, while tenants with rights of occupancy possess 3\u00b716 per cent. A considerable part of the land is owned by the inhabitants of N\u0101han, some of whom got it in return for services rendered to the State, while others were given it in charity, while others purchased it from impoverished owners. The rate of revenue was increased by 25 per cent. at the last settlement.\n\nChak Sangrah.\u2014In this chak the rate of revenue is the same as in chak Sain. The chak is mountainous country. Manure of all kinds is used. The area cultivated by the owners themselves is 64 per cent. of the whole cultivated area. Tenants with rights of occupancy cultivate 15\u00b719 per cent.\n\nIn chak Bhawai the area cultivated by the landlords themselves is 76\u00b712 per cent. and that by the tenants with rights of occupancy 7\u00b712 per cent. of the total cultivated area. The chak is remarkable, in that no village in it is owned by an outsider. Landowners are for the most part Kanets and Bh\u0101ts, but Kol\u012bs are also found with proprietary rights. The soil of this chak is of the same quality as of chak Karli. The rate of revenue is the same as in that chak.\nThe people of Kangra (I) chak are comparatively prosperous. They are of good physique and industrious habits. The soil is poorer than that of Kangra (II), and the rate of revenue proportionately lower. The area cultivated by the landlords themselves is 68\u00b712 per cent. of the total cultivated area. Tenants with right of occupancy cultivate 3\u00b717 per cent. The area irrigated is 25 per cent. of the cultivated area. Land-owners are Kanets and Bhats.\n\nIn Kangra (II) owners cultivate 62\u00b715 per cent. of the whole area cultivated, and 18\u00b714 per cent. is cultivated by hereditary tenants. The irrigated area is one-fourth of the whole cultivated area.\n\nPachhad Tahsil has been divided into seven chaks. It yields the largest revenue of all the Tahsils. At the last settlement the revenue was increased by Rs. 3,549. The whole Tahsil is hilly. The rivers Giri and Jalal flow through it, but irrigate a very small area. The Sain Dh\u00e1r produces basmati rice of the best quality. The chief landowners are Kanets and Bhats. In some villages Kol\u00eds own the land. Manure of all kind is used throughout the whole Tahsil. The tobacco of Panjhote is famous for its quality. Walnuts, pomegranates and the \"Halla\" nut (Halela) are among the important products. The road to Dagshai from Nah\u00e1n passes through the Tahsil. It contains the jagirs of Kanwar Randip Singh and Kanwar Ranzor Singh.\n\nIn Majhgaon the irrigated area is 37 per cent., and the area cultivated by the landlords themselves is 67\u00b712 per cent. of the whole area and under cultivation. Tenants with rights of occupancy possess 7\u00b73 per cent. The inhabitants are comparatively wealthy. The soil is of excellent quality. The revenue is at the highest rate in the State. The landowners are Kanets and Bhats.\n\nOf the whole area of chak Karg\u00e1nun 42 per cent. is irrigated. The area cultivated by owners themselves is 69\u00b712 per cent., while the tenants with rights of occupancy cultivate 1\u00b74 per cent.\n\nIn chak Rajgarh the people are fairly well-off. The irrigated area is 30\u00b78 per cent. of the whole cultivated area. Owners themselves cultivate 59\u00b711 per cent., while tenants with right of occupancy cultivate 5\u00b717 per cent. The rate of revenue is two annas in the rupee lower than the rate in Majhgaon and Karg\u00e1nun.\n\nThe area irrigated in Mangadh is 38\u00b717 per cent. of the whole cultivated area. The area cultivated by owners is 42\u00b717, that by tenants with rights of occupancy 5\u00b715 per cent. Its soil is fertile. The chak is noted for its walnuts. The rate of revenue is 20 pe cent. above the rate is Majhgaon.\nIn chak Sar\u00e1han the area cultivated by the owners themselves is 67\u00b72 per cent. and that cultivated by tenants with rights of occupancy is 3\u00b711 per cent. of the whole area cultivated. Only 22\u00b719 per cent. of the cultivated area is irrigated. The people are poor. The rate of revenue is only half as heavy as the rate in Mangadh. It was decreased at the last settlement.\n\nIn Narag the rate of revenue is the same as in R\u00e1jgarh. Its inhabitants are prosperous. The irrigated area is 38 per cent. of the whole area cultivated. The area cultivated by owners themselves is 69\u00b715 per cent. Tenants with rights of occupancy cultivate 6 per cent.\n\nOf the cultivated area in chak Ponw\u00e1la 8 per cent. is irrigated, 40 per cent. is cultivated by owners, and 10 per cent. by occupancy tenants.\n\nThe important jagird\u00e1rs are:\n\n1. Kanwar Rand\u00edp Singh.\n2. Kanwar Ranzor Singh.\n3. Kanwar Devi Singh.\n4. Mi\u00e1n Jagat J\u00edt Chand.\n5. Mi\u00e1n Part\u00e1b Singh, Bil\u00e1sputri\u00e1.\n6. Mahant Paras R\u00e1m D\u00e1s of Jagan N\u00e1th\u2019s temple.\n7. Mahant Sumer N\u00e1th, R\u00e1j Guru.\n8. Kanwar Surchet Singh.\n9. Kanwar Kundan Singh.\n10. Kanwar Mohan Singh.\n\nThe memory of Mahant Banw\u00e1ri D\u00e1s, at whose instance Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja Karam Park\u00e1sh founded the town of N\u00e1han, is held in great reverence. A j\u00e1gir is assigned to his successors. Their pedigree table is given below:\n\nMahant Banw\u00e1ri D\u00e1s.\n\n| Mahant Singi Rikh. |\n|-------------------|\n| Mahant N\u00e1r\u00e1in D\u00e1s. |\n| Mahant K\u00e1nshi D\u00e1s. |\n| Mahant R\u00e1m Krishan D\u00e1s. |\n| Mahant M\u00e1dho D\u00e1s. |\n| Mahant Mohan D\u00e1s. |\n| Mahant Lachhman D\u00e1s (who died before he succeeded). |\n| Mahant Paras R\u00e1m D\u00e1s. |\nAnother personage worthy of mention is the R\u00e1j Guru, from whom the ruler and members of his family receive religious instruction (gur-mantra). A great concourse (jashan) takes place on the Dusehra at K\u00e1li's temple (where the R\u00e1j Guru lives), and incense is burnt and prayers offered (hav\u00e1n). Buffaloes and goats are sacrificed, and there is dancing. The R\u00e1j\u00e1 seats the G\u00faru by his side and offers a nazr\u00e1na to him. Then the other members of the R\u00e1j\u00e1's family and the darb\u00e1r\u00eds offer him presents. The Mahant is a jogi worshipper of the goddess K\u00e1li.\n\nA j\u00e1gird\u00e1r collects and keeps the revenue of his j\u00e1gir village. He is entitled to every kind of revenue of his village, even local rate and income from excise. He appoints his own lambar\u00edd\u00e1r, zaild\u00e1r and patw\u00e1ri.\n\nThe rule as to the resumption of j\u00e1girs is that one-third lapses on the death of the assignee, another third on the death of his successor, while on the death of the third holder his successor is given a life allowance.\n\nThe State has endowed several temples and religious persons with assignments of land revenue. In some cases proprietary rights, as well as the revenue, have been conferred on these.\n\nThe gross annual income of the State is Rs. 8,59,896, of which sum Rs. 3,47,896 is derived from estates outside Sirm\u00far.\nSection D.\u2014Miscellaneous Revenue.\n\nThere is no license for the wholesale vend of country spirit, and still-head duty is not levied. Country spirit is made in the State, retail vendors being allowed to distil their own liquor. The licenses for retail sale are auctioned as in the Punjab. There are shops at\u2014\n\nTahsil N\u00e1han: N\u00e1han, Tilokpur, and Bank\u00e1b\u00e1r\u00e1 (kept by one contractor).\n\nTahsil Paunta: Sataun, B\u00e1ta Mandi, Paunta, Kolar, and M\u00e1jra.\n\nTahsil Raink\u00e1: Raink\u00e1.\n\nTahsil Pachh\u00e1d: Thaur, Naw\u00e1r, Sar\u00e1han, Argusina, K\u00e1l\u00e1 Gh\u00e1t, Karg\u00e1nun, J\u00e1l\u00f3n, N\u00e1rag and S\u00e1ndna.\n\nEuropean liquor is only sold retail at N\u00e1han by a firm trading under the name of 'Universal Supplier,' which obtains its supply from British territory. Rum imported from British territory is sold at N\u00e1han both in this shop and by the retail vendor of country spirit.\n\nThe hill opium grown in the State is alone used, twenty-four licenses for its wholesale vend being issued. The retail licenses are auctioned as in the Punjab. The shops are distributed as follows:\n\nTahsil N\u00e1han: one shop at N\u00e1han.\n\nTahsil Paunta: ten shops\u2014Paunta, Kolar, M\u00e1jra, B\u00e1ta Mandi, Bhang\u00e1n\u00ed, R\u00e1jpur, Ch\u00e1ndn\u00ed, M\u00e1npur, Puruw\u00e1la and Sataun.\n\nTahsil Raink\u00e1: one shop\u2014Raink\u00e1.\n\nTahsil Pachh\u00e1d: ten shops\u2014N\u00e1rag, Thaur, Naw\u00e1r, R\u00e1jgarh, Kag\u00e1nun, Sar\u00e1han, Galon, Argus\u00edna and Kotl\u00e1 B\u00edrog, S\u00e1nidn\u00e1 and K\u00e1l\u00e1 Gh\u00e1t.\n\nHemp grows wild in the State, but bhang only appears to be used in small quantities. Some charas is imported from British territory. The licenses for the vend of opium also cover that of drugs.\n\nThe Indian Stamp and Court-fees Acts are in force, the judicial stamps being distinct from the non-judicial. Judicial stamps are for 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12 annas and for 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 16, 20, 30, 40, 60, 70, 100, 200 and 400 rupees. Non-judicial stamps are for 2, 4 and 8 annas and for 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 rupees. All these stamps are obtained from Messrs. Waterlow and Sons in England. Stamps are sold at the Sadr and Tahsil Treasuries. There are ten licensed vendors, two at N\u00e1han and at Paunta and three at Raink\u00e1 and Pachh\u00e1d, one at each place being an official.\nSection E.\u2014Local and Municipal Government.\n\nThe amalgamated offices of the District Board and Municipal Committee are called the District Municipal Board. The President of the Municipal Committee, who is *ex-officio* Vice-President of the District Board, is in charge of the Board.\n\nThe District Board has a President, a Vice-President and nineteen members.\n\nThere is only one District Board for the whole State. The only municipality is N\u00e1han.\nSection F.\u2014Public Works.\n\nThe Public Works Department of the State is in the charge of a superintending engineer, subordinate to whom is an assistant engineer actual charge of the work of the department, which construc all public buildings and looks after the Simla-Paunta and K\u00e1l. mb Roads. The District and Municipal Boards carry out their own works. The Public Works Department has recently built the Jubilee Hospital at N\u00e1han, the Tahsil buildings at N\u00e1han and Raink\u00e1, the Public Works Office at N\u00e1han and the State stables.\nSection G.\u2014Army.\n\nThe late R\u00e1j\u00e1 Sir Shamsher Park\u00e1sh had a well-disciplined force of about 400 infantry and 150 cavalry. During the second Afghan War, he, early in 1879, offered his personal services on the staff of General Roberts, but these were declined, though the R\u00e1j\u00e1 received the thanks of the Government of India. In the following year, however, the R\u00e1j\u00e1, in common with other Punjab Chiefs, and in fulfilment of the terms of his sanad, asked to be allowed to send a contingent to Afghanistan, and 200 men, under the late Colonel R. C. Whiting, formerly an officer of the Indian Staff Corps, served with distinction in the campaign. As a reward for these services the R\u00e1j\u00e1 was definitely accorded the honour of a return visit from His Excellency the Viceroy. In 1888 the R\u00e1j\u00e1 offered to raise a body of Imperial Service Troops, consisting of 500 infantry with 2 Maxim guns. Government accepted 150 infantry with 30 sappers and two companies of Pioneers were raised. These were subsequently (in 1889) formed into the Imperial Service Sappers and Miners and served with distinction in the Tirah campaign of 1897-98 under the command of Major Bir Bikram Singh, the younger brother of the present R\u00e1j\u00e1. He received the Order of the Indian Empire in recognition of his services, together with the rank of Captain in the British Army in which capacity he is attached to the Bengal Sappers and Miners.\n\nThe Sappers were employed from March 1901 to April 1902 on the construction of the Khush\u00e1lgarh-Kohat Railway. Their work and discipline were highly commended. Major Bir Bikram Singh represented the Imperial Service Sappers at the Coronation of His Majesty the King-Emperor of India in 1902 and was made an A.-D.-C. to the Commander-in-Chief of the British Army and given the Coronation Medal. Jamadar Chattar Singh represented the State Sappers at the opening ceremony of the Commonwealth Parliament of Australia.\n\nIn addition to the Imperial Service Troops the State maintains a force of 200 infantry and 30 cavalry. The former are armed with Sniders and are as well-drilled and efficient as the Sappers and Miners. The State also possesses 7 pieces of artillery and maintains a military band. The men enlisted in both corps are Rajputs, Muhammadans, Gurkhas, Punjabi and a few Purbiyas.\nSection H.\u2014Police and Jails.\n\nThe Police Department is in charge of a Superintendent who is directly responsible to the R\u00e1j\u00e1. There are four police stations, with head-quarters at N\u00e1han, Sar\u00e1han, Raink\u00e1 and M\u00e1jra, each in charge of a Deputy Inspector. There are four out-posts, at K\u00e1l\u00e1-Amb, Haripur M\u00e1jra, Haripur Raink\u00e1 and Tali. The total strength of the police force is 129, excluding chauk\u00edd\u00e1rs. The Department is administered on the lines of the Police Act and Punjab Police Code.\n\nThe one jail in the State is at N\u00e1han. It is in charge of a Superintendent, under whom are a jailor, an assistant jailor, a hospital assistant, a head warder, a drill instructor and fifteen warders. The Department is managed on the lines of Punjab Jail Manual and the Indian Prisoners and Prisons Acts. The jail can accommodate a hundred male and female prisoners. In 1903-04, one-hundred and forty-seven males and seven females were imprisoned, and the daily average prison population was over fifty-six. The expenditure was Rs. 92-11-0 per head.\n\nIn the same year there were only seventy-nine admissions to the jail hospital, with one death, and the general health was exceptionally good.\n\nThe jail industries are the manufacture of carpets, durries and matting.\nSection I.\u2014Education and Literacy.\n\nThere are five State schools in Sirmur, viz., the High School and a Girls\u2019 School at Nahan and primary schools with one teacher each at Tilokpur, Sarahan and Paunta. The High School has a staff of eleven masters including a Gymnastic Instructor and a Sanskrit teacher, and it is inspected annually by the Inspector of Schools, Ambala Circle.\n\nThe Girls\u2019 School is under a head mistress with one assistant. The average attendance is thirty-five. Needle-work is the principal subject, with some Nagri and Urdu, but the girls do not remain after the age of fifteen. Two or three Muhammadan women at Nahan also teach girls of good families the Qor\u00e1n, and some Hindu women teach girls and women Nagri, especially the Vishnu Sahansar Nam (\u201cThe thousand names of God\u201d), but in both cases the object is religion rather than education.\n\nIn addition to the State schools, there are a few indigenous schools, e.g., at Banur in Paunta Tahsil, where Nagri is taught; Badog in Sain, Tahsil Raink\u00e1, where Urdu is taught; at Kufarmand in Pachhad, where a pandit teaches Hindi and Sirmuri,1 and at several places in Nahan Tahsil Urdu and the Qor\u00e1n are taught to both girls and boys.\n\nBrahman boys get a certain amount of instruction in pa dh\u00e1\u00ed from the Ghorachakra, the Saraswat and similar books, and the Gita and some grammar are also taught.\n\nThe shop-keeping class teach their sons the Mahajani script. They learn arithmetic and the rules of interest, but their learning is purely mechanical.\n\n---\n\n1 Sirmuri script is peculiar to some extent.\nSection J.\u2014Medical.\n\nIn 1872 His Highness the late R\u00e1j\u00e1, Sir Shamsher Park\u00e1sh, opened a small dispensary in N\u00e1han where medical treatment according to European methods could be obtained. Since then the medical department has grown in popularity and in efficiency, and there are now a Central Hospital, a Female Hospital, Military and Jail Hospitals at N\u00e1han, and three Tahsil dispensaries at Paunta, Sar\u00e1han and Dad\u00e1hu, head-quarters of Raink\u00e1 Tahsil, and three small village dispensaries, providing European medical treatment for all comers at Shillai near at Chakrota at R\u00e1jgarh, five stages from Simla, and at Sangr\u00e1h, midway between that place and R\u00e1jgarh. These village dispensaries are off the main roads, and are intended for the benefit of the inhabitants of the higher hills.\n\nThe Municipal Committee employs a hakim for the treatment of those who prefer native medicines, but their number is small, and the hakim has lately applied to be allowed to attend the Central Hospital and learn the European system.\n\nThe present R\u00e1j\u00e1 has engaged a European graduate in medicine and surgery as Superintendent of the Medical and Sanitary Departments of the Department, with an experienced Assistant Surgeon as Officer in charge of the Civil Dispensary, a lady Assistant Surgeon in charge of the Female Hospital, and Hospital Assistants for the dispensaries, besides a staff of compounders and servants.\n\nMedical stores are mostly procured direct from England on indent by the Medical Adviser through the Commercial Department of the State, by which they are supplied as required, to the hospitals and dispensaries, on indents countersigned by the Medical Superintendent. Surgical requisites, stationery, etc., are supplied in the same way under the same control.\n\nThe hill people willingly take medicine from Hind\u00fas or Christians (especially Europeans), but in many parts they will not do so from a Muhammadan, and so only Hind\u00fas are employed as compounders in the medical department. This prejudice is, however, gradually disappearing, as all treatment at the dispensaries is absolutely free, and as the prospects of the Hospital Assistants depend largely on their popularity in their districts, the attitude of the hill people towards the Department is decidedly friendly. In 1902 the Central Hospital was moved into a new and handsome building called the Jubilee Hospital, which was erected by the present R\u00e1j\u00e1 at a considerable cost in memory of Her Imperial Majesty the late Queen-Empress. His Highness intends to build a new female hospital, as the present one has little accommodation.\nThe female hospital was started in 1896. Miss Balfour, a graduate of Edinburgh, was appointed superintendent. She remained in charge till March 1902. In 1902 Mrs. Collin was appointed in charge. She was not so successful, and was followed in 1903 by Mrs. Winter.\n\nThe marginal table shows the yearly total of patients from 1899 to 1906.\n\n| Yearly total |\n|--------------|\n| 1899         | 6,090       |\n| 1900         | 7,487       |\n| 1901         | 6,057       |\n| 1902         | 7,818       |\n| 1903         | 4,291       |\n\nThe average daily attendance of new patients is now only five a day, but it is hoped that the hospital will gradually regain its former popularity. Under Miss Balfour the expenditure was about Rs. 4,200 a year, but at present it is only about Rs. 3,700. The staff has from the first comprised a Lady Doctor, a d\u0101i, a cook, a kah\u0101rni, a sweeperess and a dhoban, and in 1903 a compounder was added to the staff.\n\nThe R\u0101ja himself is head of the plague department. He has under him a superintendent and an inspector. No one can enter the State territory except by the authorised routes, each of which is in charge of an hospital assistant and a police guard. There are quarantine camps on these routes where travellers have to remain during their term of quarantine. There are separate camps for people coming from infected and non-infected areas. Kah\u0101rs, sweepers and washermen are maintained in the camp, and even cooking utensils and blankets are supplied by the hospital assistant. The term of quarantine is from twenty-four hours to ten days. The rules are strict and are carefully enforced. Up to the present time, thanks to these arrangements, the State has been free from plague. The routes open for ingress are by K\u0101l\u0101-Amb, Talehr\u012b, Pr\u012btnagar, Haripur, Konch and R\u0101mpur. All other routes are open for egress only.\nCHAPTER IV.\u2014SOME PLACES OF INTEREST.\n\nBanethi.\n\nBanethi lies on the Sar\u00e1han road at an elevation of 4,943 feet, twelve miles north-west of N\u00e1han. There is a good rest-house which commands a fine view of the N\u00e1han Siw\u00e1liks. It is the first stage from N\u00e1han to Dagshai.\n\nBhujjal.\n\nBhujjal is merely of interest as a camping ground, being the third stage from Simla on the Simla-Chakr\u00e1ta road in 77\u00b0 25' N. and 30\u00b0 55' E. on the Bachhi\u00e1ri naddi. The camping ground is on a plateau and commands a fine view of the Jubbal hills. The Chaur peak is two stages from this camping ground, and N\u00e1han six.\n\nB\u00edr Bikram\u00e1b\u00e1d.\n\nB\u00edr Bikram\u00e1b\u00e1d is a good head-quarters for shooting, six miles south of N\u00e1han on the eastern bank of the M\u00e1rkanda. It has large fruit and vegetable gardens, and mangoes and ponda (sugarcane) are grown. The gardens are irrigated from the M\u00e1rkanda. The place belongs to Major B\u00edr Bikram Singh, C.I.E.\n\nChaur Peak.\n\nThe Chaur peak, an elevation of 11,982 feet above the sea, is one of the highest summits among the mountains which occupy the sub-Him\u00e1lay\u00e1n tract. Its position is 30\u00b0 52' N. and 77\u00b0 32' E. From its peculiar shape and great height it forms a conspicuous element in the landscape for many miles around. The Chaur presents a striking appearance from the plains of Sirhind, and the view from its summit embraces a vast lowland tract on the south, and a wide panorama of the snowy range to the northward. Though below the limit of perpetual snow, drifts remain in the shady chasms on its flanks throughout the summer months. A dense forest of deod\u00e1rs and other conifers clothe the northern and north-eastern declivities, and rhododendrons, ferns, and gentians grow in patches on the detritus of its granite slopes. On the top of the peak, is a small Shieling which is worshipped. At its foot lies the temple, beside a spring. The Ling and temple have been described in Chapter I.\n\nDad\u00e1hu.\n\nDad\u00e1hu, the head-quarters of Tahsil Raink\u00e1, is about sixteen miles north of N\u00e1han and lies on a low hill at the confluence of the Giri and Jal\u00e1l, surrounded on all sides by mountains. Satib\u00e1gh, which lies within the village, is a well known resort for members\nof the Giri Fishing Club. About a mile from the Tahsil lies the famous Raink\u00e1 lake and Pars R\u00e1m\u2019s tank. Satib\u00e1g commands a fine view of the Giri and of the trans-Giri hills which are covered with dense jungle. The climate is malarious after the rainy season. Its population in 1901 was 141. The head-quarters of the Raink\u00e1 th\u00e1n\u00e1 are in the tahsil building which was finished in 1900. There is a dispensary and post office in the village.\n\n**Dingarh Kiner.**\n\nDingarh Kiner stands on a picturesque site, in the gorge traversed by the route from N\u00e1han to R\u00e9jgarh in Tahsil Pachh\u00e1d, in $30\u00b0 44' N.$ and $77\u00b0 21' E.$ Northwards, it looks towards the Chaur mountain, southwards, along the valley of the Jal\u00e1l river. The village consists of well-built flat-roofed houses, arranged in rows on the solid lime-stone ledges of the mountain. The surrounding country, though rocky, contains some fertile spots, which produce luxuriant crops of wheat.\n\n**Haripur Fort.**\n\nHaripur, formerly a fort on the borders of the Jubbal State, is now occupied by a police outpost. The fort is 8,802 feet above sea level, in $77\u00b0 35' N.$ and $30\u00b0 45' E.$\n\n**Haripur Khol.**\n\nHaripur lies in $77\u00b0 25' N.$ and $30\u00b0 25' E.$, and commands the pass of that name. The direct route from Raink\u00e1 to Jag\u00e1dhri passes through it, and a plague quarantine post has been established here. The village, which is built like a village in the plains, stands on level ground amid the low hills of the N\u00e1han Siw\u00e1liks. The pass, which is about two miles from Kolar, is narrow and steep. Kolar, on the N\u00e1han-Paunta road, twelve miles east of N\u00e1han, in the Ki\u00e1rda D\u00fan at the head of this pass, is a mart for the hill trade.\n\n**Jaitak.**\n\nThe hill fortress of Jaitak crowns a steep ridge of slate, which rises above the Ki\u00e1rda D\u00fan, in $30\u00b0 36' N.$ and $77\u00b0 24' E.$ During the war in 1814, the G\u00farkhas occupied this position with a garrison of 2,200 men. They were attacked by two British detachments 1,700 strong, but without success; and it was not until after a tedious series of operations that the fort was finally captured in the following year. The elevation above sea-level is 4,854 feet.\n\nThe fortress was subsequently used as a prison, but is now in ruins. A small hamlet is the only remnant of old Jaitak. It commands a fine view of the Sain, N\u00e1han and Dh\u00e1rthi hills. The famous Jaitak Khel of Kanets derives its name from this village.\nK\u00e1l\u00e1-Amb lies in 77\u00b0 15' N. and 30\u00b0 30' E. on the borders of the Amb\u00e1l\u00e1 District. Its sarai is eleven miles two furlongs from N\u00e1han. This is the most frequented route in the State and almost all travellers to and from the Punjab use it. The M\u00e1rkanda flows by it on the east. The ascent to N\u00e1han commences here. K\u00e1l\u00e1-Amb has a good pakka sarai with two b\u00e1l\u00e1kh\u00e1n\u00e1s on either side of the gateway, one of which is furnished in European style. It is the chief plague quarantine chauki, and contains a police and forest outpost. The quarantine post is in charge of a hospital assistant. Travellers from non-infected areas are allowed to stay in the sarai, but all others are detained in large huts, of which a regular village has been built on the west bank of M\u00e1rkanda.\n\nKat\u00e1san Devi.\n\nThe Kat\u00e1san Devi pass runs over the crest of a low transverse ridge, which crosses the Ki\u00e1rda D\u00fan from the sub-Him\u00e1lay\u00e1n chain to the Siw\u00e1lik, in 30\u00b0 31' N. and 77\u00b0 28' E. The ridge divides the waters of the B\u00e1t\u00e1, a tributary of the Jumna, from those of the M\u00e1rkanda flowing south-west towards the Sutlej. The route from Dehra to N\u00e1han runs through the pass. The elevation above sea level is 2,500 feet. The pass lies eleven miles from N\u00e1han. The K\u00e1lar and rest-house are one and-a-quarter miles from the temple. The place was once a resort of tigers, but none are now found. The Devi's temple lies in a thick forest of sal trees with no habitation near it. Ghul\u00e1m K\u00e1dir Rohilla was defeated by the Sirm\u00far forces at this spot. It is owned and inhabited by Lab\u00e1n\u00e1s.\n\nM\u00e1jra.\n\nM\u00e1jra lies in 77\u00b0 35' N. and 30\u00b0 25' E., 20 miles east of N\u00e1han. It was the head-quarters of the Tahsil till 1893 when they were transferred to Paunta. It now only possesses a police station, post office and forest chauki, with a comfortable bungalow which can be used as a rest-house, situated near forests abounding in big and small game. The famous Jambu Khala is close by. The bungalow was originally built for Lord Lytton who came to shoot in Jambu Khala.\n\nMoginand.\n\nMoginand (Moganand) is the name of a village and low pass across the Siw\u00e1lik range on the route from S\u00e1dhaura to N\u00e1han, nine miles south-west of the latter town, in 30\u00b0 32' N. and 77\u00b0 19' E. The path leads up the valley of the M\u00e1rkanda, past the village of Moginand, which formed the rendezvous of the British column for the attack on N\u00e1han during the Gurkha war in 1815. The approximate elevation of the crest of the pass is 2,600 feet above sea level.\n\nThe population in 1901 was 231.\nN\u00e1han, founded by R\u00e1j\u00e1 Karam Park\u00e1sh in Sambat 1678, is the capital of the State. Situated on an isolated ridge, it has a small population (6,256 souls in 1901). It is a picturesque town and well organised. Including the Civil Station its length is about two miles. The palace stands on the highest point, the town lying on its west, north and south. East of the palace is a plain called the Chaugan, surrounded by neat buildings, including the Club and the gurdw\u0101ra of Guru Gobind Singh at its southern corner. Shamsherpur Cantonment, over a mile in length, lies west of the town.\n\nIn and about the town are several tanks and springs. The water of the Shivpuri spring is the purest, but as it lies some distance from the town, only the wealthier inhabitants can make use of it. Bathing and washing in the tanks used for drinking are prohibited. The town is surrounded by forest.\n\nR\u00e1j\u00e1 Shamsher Park\u00e1sh built a house in the Italian style called the Shamsher Villa on the eastern extremity of the N\u00e1han Dhar. The present R\u00e1j\u00e1 transacts the daily business of the State in a handsome building called the Head Office, erected on a small isolated hill in its compound; a new office is in course of construction. The Villa is also used as a guest house for the Viceroy, Commander-in-Chief or Lieutenant-Governor.\n\nThe District courts lie close by, with the offices of the Accounts, Forest and Police Departments, all on a ridge above the road leading from N\u00e1han to the Villa. The Tahsil is close to the District courts. In the centre of the town is the R\u00e1ni-t\u00e1l B\u00e1gh Garden. It contains a round tank on the bank of which is a fine temple. The iron foundry stands midway between the town and the Villa.\n\nThe hospital, which is of modern design, lies outside the town, and the Zen\u00e1na Hospital is inside it near the Chaug\u00e1n. The boys' school, a commodious building, lies east of the Chaug\u00e1n, and the Zen\u00e1na Madrasa inside the town.\n\nIt is said that the hill, on which the town now stands, was once the strong-hold of Bera Rangar, a notorious dacoit. A proverb runs: \"Bere l\u00e1i na chaure kaunth\u00e1 aur saher,\" i.e., the cattle seized by Bera will never come back to you, get fresh ones. Bera had a kund or pit of stone on the L\u00e1\u00ed hill. In this he used to light a fire of cotton seed and oil, and after his raids the beacon guided him back to his lair.\n\nThe Devi temple built by him on the summit of this hill still exists, and his cattle-shed lay by the kachcha tank in the town. B\u00e1wa Banw\u00e1ri D\u00e1s, a well-known S\u00e1dhu, lived on this\nhill, where the State b\u00e1r\u00e1dari now stands. R\u00e1ja Karm Park\u00e1sh once arrived at this hill when hunting from Kalsi, and the B\u00e1wa begged him to found a town here. The R\u00e1j\u00e1 did so and constructed a b\u00e1r\u00e1dari on the spot where the B\u00e1wa lived. The b\u00e1r\u00e1dari stands on a high tibba. It can be seen from the train near Bar\u00e1ra Station. In those days tigers abounded in N\u00e1han, and the B\u00e1wa had reared several. A tiger's roar at a propitious moment suggested the foundation of the town. The derivation of the name N\u00e1han is either from Nahar (Sanscrit = tiger), or n\u00e1h (= king) and \u00e1in (= abode).\n\nN\u00e1han is 3,057 feet above sea level. In the hot weather punkhas are not usually required. The rains set in about the middle of June, and even on the hottest day the temperature does not rise above 100\u00b0. Usually at noon it reaches 90\u00b0. In the hot weather the temperature ranges between 80\u00b0 and 90\u00b0. In the winter it is between 50\u00b0 and 65\u00b0.\n\nThe climate is moist. Epidemics seldom attack the town. Towards the end of September there is, however, some malarial fever. The water contains much lime, and tends to cause constipation. Snow never falls, but it rains heavily in January and February.\n\nThe Municipality, constituted in 1887, consists of nine members, four elected and five nominated, all serving for a period of three years. The president is a paid official appointed by the R\u00e1j\u00e1, but the vice-president is elected.\n\nThe income, mainly derived from octroi, was Rs. 15,243 in 1903-04, and the expenditure Rs. 13,910. The Committee owns a number of houses and manages the forests round N\u00e1han. From these it derives a considerable income. The Cantonment is administered by a Cantonment Magistrate. It contains a military hospital and a workshop which turns out accoutrements for the troops.\n\nMahipur.\n\nMahipur lies sixteen miles north-west of N\u00e1han on a low spur of the Sain range. It is a small but pretty place with some picturesque waterfalls to the south. It is situated on a plateau between lofty hills on three sides, its southern edge overlooking low hills. The plateau is intersected by a hill stream which makes it very fertile.\n\nM\u00e1ngadh.\n\nM\u00e1ngadh is a scattered village with a population of 380. It is built on a wide level plain surrounded on all sides by high hills and traversed by a torrent. It possesses an ancient Hindu temple which tradition connects with the P\u00e1ndavas, but was probably built by R\u00e1j\u00e1 Ras\u00e1l\u00fa of Si\u00e1lkot, whose style of building it recalls. It has been described in Chapter I. M\u00e1ngadh is connected with Sar\u00e1han, about ten miles off, by a six-foot path.\nPaunta.\n\nPaunta lies in $77^\\circ 40' N.$ and $30^\\circ 45' E.$ It has a population (1901) of 609. The Jumna flows close by on its east and south. It commands a fine view of the Dera D\u00fan and its hills. The town contains a famous Sikh temple where fairs are held on the Holis in March and the Bais\u00e1khi in April. Guru Gobind Singh resided here for about three years (1742\u201445 Bikrami) and therefore the place is considered sacred. The colonization of the Ki\u00e1rda D\u00fan by Sikhs has increased its population. It also contains a fine Hindu temple, built by the daughter of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Fateh Park\u00e1sh on the bank of the Jumna. By her request she was cremated here, and a fine marble tomb was erected on the spot. Between the two temples is a spacious encamping-ground with fine avenues of trees. The R\u00e1mpur ferry is only three miles distant. The Tahs\u00edl (twenty-six miles from N\u00e1han) is built of good pakka masonry. Bhag\u00e1ni, where Guru Gobind Singh defeated the combined forces of the R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Garhw\u00e1l and Bil\u00e1spur, is about eight miles from Paunta. The town has a dispensary, rest-house and post office. The Western Jumna Canal authorities have a telephone office near the camping-ground, whence information of the daily rise and fall of the Jumna is sent to Bogrew\u00e1la.\n\nR\u00e1jgarh.\n\nR\u00e1jgarh fort lies in $30^\\circ 5' N.$ and $77^\\circ 23' E.$ on a natural terrace. It is square, with a tower at each corner about forty feet high and twenty square. Fired and nearly demolished by the Gurkhas in 1814, it was subsequently restored. Its elevation above sea level is 7,115 feet. R\u00e1jgarh is the head-quarters of the forest division of that name, and the Divisional Officer lives in the fort. About half a mile from the fort is a small bazar inhabited by K\u00e1ngra S\u00fads, who act as bankers for the surrounding villages. There is a post office and dispensary.\n\nSain.\n\nThe Sain range lies between $30^\\circ 37'$ and $30^\\circ 51' N.$ and $77^\\circ 15'$ and $77^\\circ 29' E.$ Thornton states that its length is about 25 miles, running from north-west to south-east. This range divides the basin of the Jal\u00e1l from that of the Giri. Its estimated elevation above sea level is from 6,000 to 8,000 feet. It is the most fertile range in the cis-Giri hills, and produces rice of the best quality.\n\nSangrah.\n\nSangrah lies in $77^\\circ 23' N.$ and $30^\\circ 40' E.$, trans-Giri, and commands a splendid view of the Sain range. It has a dispensary and post office, and was the head-quarters of Palvi Tahs\u00edl till 1948 B. (1892 A.D.).\nSarahan.\n\nSarahan, the head-quarters of Tahsil Pachhad, lies in 77\u00b0 15' N. and 30\u00b0 45' E., and has a population of 132. It is a sultry place, but possesses a healthy climate, as a brisk breeze blows every morning and evening throughout the year. Sarahan is twenty-six miles from Nah\u00e1n, with which it is connected by a fine road. Dagshai is twenty-one miles from the Tahsil building. The place has a dispensary, post office and primary school. It commands a splendid view of the low hills of Ghinni and Kot\u00e1ha and the plains of Naraingarh Tahsil. It lies 5,474 feet above sea level.\n\nSirmuri Tal.\n\nThe once famous town of Sirmur stood about ten miles north-west of Paunta on the southern bank of the Giri. Destroyed in 1139 Bikrami, the ruins of its wells and bazars are still to be seen, and close by is a tank called the Sirmuri tank which is now almost all under cultivation. The r\u00e1jban which lies about a mile to the south-east of the ruins of Sirmur was made the capital of the State on 27th Ph\u00e1van 1252 (1095 A.D.) by R\u00e1ja Subhans Parkash, the founder of the present ruling family of Sirmur. It too is now in ruins. Among the ruins of Sirmur is a stone pierced with a deep hole, lying on the top of a small hillock on the southern bank of the Giri. In this hole the pole is said to have been fixed for the rope on which the juggler girl, by whose curse Sirmur was destroyed, danced. The story is referred to at page 8. A similar stone is pointed out on the other side of the Giri.\n\nTilokpur.\n\nTilokpur stands on an isolated hillock, eight miles north-west of Nah\u00e1n, in 77\u00b0 15' N. and 30\u00b0 30' E., at an elevation of 1,413 feet. The place is famous for its temple of Devi B\u00e1la Sundri, described in Chapter I. An annual fair is held in April in her honour. A path connects it with the K\u00e1l\u00e1-Amb road at Sainwala, nearly six miles below Nah\u00e1n. A cart-road runs between K\u00e1l\u00e1-Amb and Tilokpur for a distance of four miles.\nSome agricultural terms.\n\nB\u0101dg : a large square field.\n\nBand\u012b : a sub-division of a hydr field; a hydr is divided into several parts each called band\u012b.\n\nB\u0101ngar : high lying land containing sandstone.\n\nB\u0101rd\u0101 : a small field near the village; the n\u012bs\u012b of the plains. In N\u012bz\u0101m town every house has, in front of or behind it, a b\u0101rd\u0101 or kitchen garden, but in the hills pepper and tobacco are generally grown in the b\u0101rd\u0101.\n\nBh\u0101nkh\u0101r : similar to bhil\u0101r.\n\nBhil\u0101r : dry, poor soil which is not improved even by manure.

These have to be broken up before ploughing, as they are so hard that the plough cannot break them. It is a first class soil.\n\nGahb\u0101r\u012b : a poor stony soil.\n\nGhor\u0113l : much the same as gahb\u0101r\u012b.\n\nJ\u0101bah : wet marshy land, always full of water. It only produces poor crops of rice.\n\nKal\u0101dh\u016b : any irrigated land.\n\nKal\u0101dwar : soil of specially good quality.\n\nK\u0101tal : land situated on the banks of small rivers and hill torrents.\n\nKh\u0101ddar : similar to pasj\u014dbal, but which bears crops even with a light rainfall. In the D\u016bn moist lands situated in an old river bed are called kh\u0101ddar. Kh\u0101dar is the opposite of B\u0101ngar. Generally any lowlying land that retains moisture is called kh\u0101ddar.\n\nKhil : newly made and very poor land.\n\nKydr : a field which remains constantly full of water from the time of sowing to the harvest. It generally bears rice.\n\nOb\u0101r ghair-kh\u0101ddar : land neither irrigated nor manured.\n\nOb\u0101r Kh\u0101ddar : land unirrigated, but manured.\n\nP\u0101ld\u012b : land frequently visited by frost and cold.

Such soil is also called mas\u012bt.\nAppendix IV.\n\nSh\u0101kh: soil, chiefly composed of sand and small stones, which does not produce good crops.\n\nSh\u0101r\u012bt: much the same as b\u0101rd, but smaller in size and more freely manured.\n\nShelat: land over-shadowed by hills, and which thus gets very little warmth from the sun. It is generally kept damp by the moisture of the hills. The crops grown in it take long time to mature and heavy rain is injurious to them.\n\nTika: a very good soil producing rich crops.\n\nAPPENDIX II.\n\nLAND MEASURES.\n\nThe State has two standards known as pukhta and kh\u0101m. The pukhta standard is used in the tahsil of N\u0101han and the Kh\u0101lda D\u016bn, while in the Tahsils of Pachch\u0101d and Raink\u0101 the kh\u0101m bigah is the standard. 99 inches make a gatha of a pukhta bigah and 57 inches that of a kh\u0101m bigah. A square gatha makes a bh\u0101nd\u0101ra, 20 bh\u0101nd\u0101ras make a biwa and 20 biw\u0101s make a bigah. 32 pukhta biw\u0101s are equal to an acre. Three samind\u0101ri kh\u0101m bigahs make a pukhta bigah. But the hill zamindars measure their fields by the weight of seed. In D\u016br\u0101rthi, Gh\u012bni and generally in the N\u0101han Tahsil kachcha s\u0113r and mans are in use, while in the hilly Haq\u016bs the patha is the general standard. A kachcha s\u0113r is equal to 32 teldas and a kachcha man of 40 kachcha s\u0113rs is equal to 16 Government standard s\u0113rs. The State standard kh\u0101m bigah is equal to 12\u00bd s\u0113rs kh\u0101m of wheat standards of the samind\u0101rs. In measuring only the wheat is taken into consideration. A patha is equal to 5 s\u0113rs kh\u0101m, or 2 s\u0113rs of Government standard. Seven-and-a-half p\u014dthas make a pukhta bigah, or in other words 37\u00bd s\u0113rs kh\u0101m of seed are sown in a pukhta bigah.\n\nAPPENDIX III.\n\nWEIGHTS AND MEASURES.\n\nThe samind\u0101rs weights are kh\u0101m, and according to this system one s\u0113r equals to 32 teldas. The weights in N\u0101han itself are pukhta, i.e., the s\u0113r equals 80 teldas. Zamind\u0101rs generally have weights, but measures are largely used in the hills. The solh\u0101, which is also called a th\u0101bri, and in Kang\u0101ra, Tabshl Raink\u0101, a th\u0101la, equals 14 s\u0113rs kh\u0101m. Four solh\u0101s make one patha. The samind\u0101rs keep weights, viz., \u00bd p\u016bn, p\u016bn, \u00bd s\u0113r, s\u0113r and 5 s\u0113rs in their houses. One patha equals 5 s\u0113rs kh\u0101m, 16 pathas one j\u0101ni and 20 j\u0101nis one kh\u0101r. 12 gir\u0101s make one kh\u0101m yard. Four fingers make one chopp\u0101 and 2 cubits make one adh\u0101. The h\u0101th is the distance from the tip of the forefinger to the elbow. The cubit is from the tip of the thumb to the tip of the little finger. The kh\u0101m yard is made of one h\u0101th and one cubit. The p\u0101kha yard is made of 2 h\u0101ths or 4 cubits. One qadam is equal to 3 h\u0101ths or 1\u00bd yards p\u0101kha. Hill people use the kh\u0101m yard, the p\u0101kha being used in the D\u016bn and at N\u0101han. The grocers' and retail vendors' weights are teldas and mas\u0101ds as used in the plains. Trans-Giri a solh\u0101 is equal to 40 teldas, but in the cis-Giri part of Tabshl Pachch\u0101d it has no fixed standard. Some people make it 40 teldas, others only 32. Its weight depends on the custom of the family, and it is only used in lending grain which is measured on repayment by the same solh\u0101 by which it was measured when lent. But the patha has a fixed weight, being equal to 2 s\u0113rs pukhta trans Giri, while in Sain it equals 3 s\u0113rs. Hence trans-Giri the j\u0101ni equals 32 manuds, while in Sain it is 48 manuds. Sain and the cis-Giri parts of Tabshl Pachch\u0101d have a measure called bah\u0101tra which is equal to 9 s\u0113rs kh\u0101m. It derives its name from bah\u0101tra, i.e., 72, having been invented in 1872 Bikrami. It is only used on the kh\u0101led\u0101ra or threshing floor for dividing the grain into shares. In Tabshl Raink\u0101 there is another measure called h\u0101rd, which equals 4 pathas.\n\nAPPENDIX IV.\n\nLIST OF FLORA OF THE SIRMUR STATE.\n\nI.\u2014Menispermaeae.\n\n(1) Cocculus laurifolius: kirka,\n\n(2) Cissampelos pareira.\n\nII.\u2014Berberideae.\n\n(3) Berberis aristata: kasmal,\n\n(4) Lychnis: hashmal,\n\n(5) Nepalensis.\n\nIII.\u2014Bixineae.\n\n(6) Flacourtia Ramontchi: langu or hongi,\nIV.\u2014Dipterocarpaceae.\n\n(7) Shorea robusta: sal.\n\nV.\u2014Malvaceae.\n\n(8) Kydia calycina.\n\n(9) Bombax malabaricum: simal.\n\nVI.\u2014Sterculiaceae.\n\n(10) Sterculia spp.\n\n(11) colorata.\n\nVII.\u2014Tiliaceae.\n\n(12) Grewia oppositifolia: bial.\n\n(13) sclerophylla: pharria.\n\n(14) vestita: dhamin.\n\n(15) asiatica: phalai dhawan, probably used for refining sugar in Saharanpur, fruit acid; rope made of its bark.\n\n(16) tilifolia: dhamin, fruit eaten, used for cart shafts, etc.\n\n(17) sapida.
