Mathews, Mr. H. Avory, and Mr. L. Baucroft presented for the Treasury, instructed by Mr. Frayling; Mr. Cannon and Mr. A. W. Sellars were counsel for the female prisoner; Mr. Warburton, and Mr. A. L. Cohen appeared for Paul Kozczula, and Mr. R. J. Murray represented other prisoners. The court was densely crowded, when the judge took his seat, a large number of ladies being also present.\n\nHis lordship immediately commenced to sum up the case, and occupied two hours and a half in doing so. He said the murder could not be disputed, and it was equally clear that robbery was the motive for the crime. The evidence, which his lordship reviewed at length, showed this. It was also remarkable that the Kozczulas had been led to believe that they would receive notice within a few minutes of the discovery of the body. It was for the jury to weigh all these facts. It might be that the murderer or murderers only intended to rob, but they would be equally guilty of the capital offence if death ensued from their violence in effecting the robbery.\n\nThe jury retired to consider their verdict shortly before one o'clock. After an absence of an hour and a half they returned, and Mr. Justice Lawrence said they had sent him two questions, which he thought it necessary he should answer publicly. The first was\u2014if the jury considered that the woman did not take an active part in the robbery leading to the murder, but knew that the robbery was being done, ought she to be found guilty of murder? The answer to that was \"Yes,\" but if they were of opinion that she did not know that the probable consequences would be murder then she ought not to be found guilty. The second question was\u2014if she knew of the probable consequences and the jury considered her to be acting under the control and influence of her husband, ought she to find her guilty? That he must answer in the affirmative, as there could be no question of control in a charge of murder.\n\nThe jury again retired, and were absent for a further period of about an hour, when they returned with a verdict of guilty against Paul Kozczula and Schmerfeld, and one of not guilty against the female prisoner.\n\nMr. Drake submitted, on behalf of Schmerfeld, that the evidence did not support a conspiracy to murder; that the crime committed was different from that intended by the conspiracy; and that the murder was not the probable consequence of such conspiracy.\n\nMr. Justice Lawrence held that those were questions of fact, and not of law, and that the jury had decided them.\n\nMr. Horace Avory said his friend was endeavouring to discuss questions of fact over again under the guise of questions of law.\n\nMr. Drake asked his lordship to reserve the pointe. Mr. Justice Lawrence was understood to say there were no points to be reserved.\n\nThe prisoner, Paul Kozczula, on being asked whether he had anything to say why sentence of death should not be passed, solemnly protested his innocence, and declared that Karl Rasch and other witnesses had committed perjury.\n\nSchmerfeld also said that he knew nothing about the matter and was innocent.\n\nMr. Justice Lawrence then passed sentence of death. In doing so he said that he entirely agreed with the verdict of the jury. It might be that there was no intention at first of murder, but there was of robbery, and that the subsequent robbery with violence, to no doubt doubt that what was done was done in pursuance of an agreement made between the prisoners; neither could it be doubted that Schmerfeld took Mr. Rasch away from the house in order that the robbery might be committed.\n\nThe prisoner Kozczula heard his doom apparently unmoved, but Schmerfeld visibly trembled and was assisted from the dock. Visibly trembling and walked determinedly, before declining almost rudely the approach of his wife, who stood near him.\n\nMr. H. Avory asked that the female prisoner might be detained until Monday, in order to give the prosecution time to consider whether they would proceed with the indictment of larceny against her.\n\nMr. Justice Lawrence assented, and the female prisoner was removed.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3200813268.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 602, "total-output-tokens": 1075, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 4805, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
