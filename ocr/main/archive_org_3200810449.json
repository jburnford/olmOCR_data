The specific allegations were that the prisoner conspired with Louis Leon Goldstein, otherwise Harry Roberts, to obtain by fraud \u00a321 and other sums from Lily Hilton in 1832 and 1830, and also indecently assaulting her. Mr. Lewis said that he appeared to prosecute on behalf of Mr. Labouchere, the proprietor of Truth. The prisoner was charged with indecent assault and conspiracy with a man named Goldstein, alias Harry Roberts, to fleece servant girls of their money. On the 10th of December, 1831, an article was published in Truth called \"The Stamford-street, Road to Ruin,\" charging the prisoner with carrying on an abominable traffic in Stamford-street under the guise of a school for preparing girls for the stage and music-halls. Roberts brought an action for libel against Mr. Labouchere, which was dismissed on the ground that the statements were true. Prisoner brought a criminal action, which was dismissed by the Lord Mayor, who stated that the statements in Truth were true, and were published for the public benefit. Both men then absconded, and Goldstein had not since been discovered.\n\nMr. Lewis trusted that the magistrates would be satisfied that the prisoner and Goldstein carried on a disgraceful traffic, and that Mr. Labouchere had done a public service in bringing them to justice. Inspector Henry Marshall, of the 17 Division, said he received warrants for the arrest of the prisoner and Goldstein on March 7th. He found that the house 165, Stamford-street, at which Goldstein had carried on business as a school, was shut up, and that he had absconded. He found that the prisoner had also left his lodgings and absconded. He was unable to trace him until that morning; when at half-past seven he found him at 21, Newington-green-road, Stoke Newington. He saw him receive a letter from a postman at the door. He said to him, \"I am Inspector Marshall, and hold a warrant for your arrest. I believe your name is J. Gardner.\" He said, \"Yes.\"\n\nWitness entered a room in which he had been sleeping, and read the warrant to him in the presence of Sergeant Partridge. He said, \"I deny having committed any fraud with Goldstein. I was simply his paid servant.\" Upon reading the warrant charging him with indecent assault, he said, \"I deny having assaulted the girl. What I have done in the matter has been as a servant to Roberts and under his instructions.\" Witness said, \"What about the action against Labouchere; you took an active part in that?\" He said, \"I was goaded on to that by Roberts and by a solicitor. I signed papers without reading them.\" Prisoner, who said he had nothing to say, was remanded.\n\nAN EXTRAORDINARY SUICIDE\n\nMarie Lalos, the seventeen-year-old daughter of a retired colonel in the French army, has committed suicide at Algiers, under the most extraordinary circumstances. She had for some time been engaged to a young man of excellent family, named Eugene Lefont, and they quarrelled. On Friday night the girl, after returning from a dance, chatted with her father for a while, insisting upon filling his pipe, and then kissing him good night, asked him, apparently in a jesting way, how he thought he could get along without her. The colonel made some affectionate reply. She then said, \"Well, you had better make up your mind; you may soon have to do so;\" and then blowing a kiss to her father\u2014which the latter responded to with a playful shake of his finger\u2014the young girl retired to her room. She was never seen alive again. It is assumed that she undressed herself, put on her nightdress, and then deliberately cut up the sheets, making them into a kind of rope. She then attached one end of the improvised rope to the balcony, and formed the other into a noose which she tightened round her neck. She must then have thrown herself out of the window.\n\nNext morning, at an early hour, some passers-by were horrified to notice the body of the young girl, attired in nothing but a thin nightdress, dangling between the first and second storeys in front of the house. They immediately gave the alarm. The body was cut down in the presence of the father, whose wild grief evoked expressions of the deepest sympathy. The medical men who were called in express the belief that the body must have been hanging from the window for at least five hours before it was discovered.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3200810449.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 648, "total-output-tokens": 1044, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 4501, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
