On the night of April 6th she was in the Sun public-house, Drury-lane, and the prisoner and the prisoner's brother were also there. The prosecutrix spoke to the brother, and asked him why he had assaulted her aunt a day or two before, and he replied that he would do it again. The prisoner at the same moment appeared to have snatched up a glass and struck the prosecutrix a violent blow with it. The consequences were very serious. The eye was very much injured, and two or three days after the prosecutrix had been at King's College hospital, where it was found necessary to remove the eye-ball. The other eye appeared to have also been seriously affected, and she will possibly be entirely blind through the injury.\u2014The prisoner, in her defence, expressed her regret for what had occurred, as she had never contemplated inflicting such serious injury upon the prosecutrix.\u2014The jury found the prisoner \"Guilty.\"\u2014Mr. Abinger said that he was instructed to state that the prisoner was ready to make some pecuniary compensation to the prosecutrix for the injury she had sustained.\u2014The Recorder remarked that if some substantial recompense were made to the prosecutrix by the prisoner's friends, it might have effect on the sentence, which was postponed to the next sessions.\n\nA BILL TRANSACTION.\n\nJohn Sydenham Kirby Wilson, a young man of gentlemanly appearance, was indicted for feloniously appropriating to his own use a bill of exchange for 300l., which had been entrusted to him for a specific purpose, with directions in writing to that effect.\u2014The prosecutor in this case was a gentleman named Lavender, residing in Ulster-terrace, Regent's-park. In the beginning of January last he had in his possession a bill of exchange for 300l., accepted by a firm in the City, and on the 11th of January he received a letter from the prisoner offering to procure discount for any bills the prosecutor might have on his hands. This led to an interview, and the bill was placed with defendant, who gave a receipt on which he undertook to return the bill, or the money he obtained for it, on the following day. The prosecutor could not obtain any money from the prisoner, and he insisted upon the bill being returned, which was done, the prisoner stating at the same time that if the bill had been left with him another day he should have discounted it. This induced the prosecutor to let him have the bill again, and he promised to bring the money on the following day. The prosecutor heard nothing more of the prisoner, and it turned out that he had discounted the bill, and received 230l. for it, the discount charged being 50 per cent.\u2014The jury found the prisoner \"Guilty,\" and he was sentenced to eight months' hard labour.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3206269241.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 924, "total-output-tokens": 681, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 2965, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
