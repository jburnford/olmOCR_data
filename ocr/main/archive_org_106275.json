Foreign Member of the Academies of Brussels and Caen. In a Letter to the Reverend Nevil Maskelyne, Astronomer Royal, F. R. S.\n\nTO THE REV. NEVIL MASKELYNE.\n\nREV. SIR,\n\nI RECEIVED, about a month ago, the favour of your letter, and return you many thanks for the Greenwich observations, which you were so obliging to send me. I wait, with impatience, the publication of your journey into Scotland, which must be very curious and interesting. I beg of you, sir, to present my respects to the Royal Society, with the inclosed astronomical observations, which I have contracted as much as I well could, consistently with a view of affording means to verify them, or rectify any mistake which, by inadvertency, may have crept in. I shall only add a short account of the instruments I used, and the elements I employed in the calculations, that a proper judgement may be formed, how far these observations may be depended upon.\n\nThe meridian altitudes were taken with a quadrant one foot radius made by Mr. Bird, very steadily fixed; free from any communication with the floor, and well placed in the plane of the meridian.\nRepeated observations for the error of the line of collimation gave $1'58''$, additive to the zenith distances.\n\nI always observed both the limbs of the Sun on the meridian, when the weather would permit: its declination was computed from the Nautical Almanac: its parallax and all refractions, account being always kept of the height of the barometer and thermometer, from Professor Mayer's tables, published by the Board of Longitude.\n\nThe declinations of the fixed stars were taken from the Connaissance des temps. The corrections on account of aberration and nutation, were either taken from the same ephemeris, or computed.\n\nMy son always observed u's satellites with a reflector, made by Short, of eighteen inches focal length, magnifying 95 times. I observed them with a reflector of two feet and a half focal length, made by Wing, magnifying the diameter of the object about 200 times.\n\nThe clock was a compound gridiron pendulum, made by the Sieur Le Paute at Paris.\n\nThe equal altitudes were taken with a quadrant of eighteen inches radius.\n\nThis astronomical journey was undertaken at the request of the government here. They expressed a desire that the situations of some of their towns, at least, should be determined by observation; and I readily concurred, without regretting either trouble or expense, in a project which had public utility in view.\n\nI am, &c.\n\nCor-\nCorresponding altitude of the Sun and Stars.\n\n| Date   | Event Description                                      | Altitude |\n|--------|--------------------------------------------------------|----------|\n| Aug. 30 | Clock at noon corrected by four obs. of Sun            | 11 54 7,9 |\n| Sept. 5 | Clock at noon corrected by seven ditto                  | 11 47 26,8 |\n|        | Clock at noon corrected by four ditto                   | 0 2 48,5 |\n|        | Clock at noon corrected by seven ditto                  | 11 57 21,1 |\n|        | Clock at noon corrected by seven ditto                  | 11 54 42,7 |\n| Oct. 10| Clock at noon corrected by eight ditto                  | 11 32 37,7 |\n|        | Clock at noon corrected by nine ditto                   | 11 31 20,2 |\n|        | Clock at noon corrected by five ditto                   | 11 22 33,1 |\n|        | Clock at noon corrected by five ditto                   | 11 21 31,0 |\n|        | Clock at noon corrected by six ditto                    | 11 20 30,5 |\n| Nov. 9 | Clock at noon corrected by five ditto                   | 0 21 23,6 |\n|        | Clock at noon corrected by three ditto                  | 0 23 10,4 |\n|        | Clock at noon corrected by three sets ditto             | 0 24 55,1 |\n|        | Clock at noon corrected by six ditto                    | 0 25 9,7 |\n|        | Clock at noon corrected by seven ditto                  | 0 30 30,5 |\n|        | Ditto.
