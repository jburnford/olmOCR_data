Mr. Breton Osborn prosecuted on behalf of the Post Office authorities, and said that the prisoner was charged with forging a telegram in order to obtain 10s. It appeared that he went on Saturday to a post-office in Peckham, and obtained 15s. in payment of two postal orders. This sum included a half-sovereign, and later in the day he went back to the office and gave the clerk in charge a gilt Jubilee sixpence, saying it had been handed to him by her in the morning for a half-sovereign. Miss Smith, the clerk, said she had not given him the coin, and declined to change it. The prisoner then appears to have gone to London Bridge Railway Station, and, saying he could not write, asked the telegraph clerk to write the following telegram for him:\n\n\"Miss Summerville, Rye-lane Post Office, Peckham. Please pay Elizabeth Cecilia Wakeling a half-sovereign in exchange for the bad one.\" This message the prisoner directed to be signed, \"From the Postmaster.\" He afterwards had the words \"and one shilling and sixpence expenses\" added. The Post Office orders which the prisoner had obtained payment for in the morning were payable to E. Cecilia Wakeling. Mr. Osborn suggested that the case came under the 11th section of the Postmasters' Protection Act, 40 and 47 Vic., which was meant to meet the difficulties which might arise with regard to forged telegrams\u2014the prisoner would also be charged with forging an authority for the payment of money. In addition to the forgery it appeared a most impudent attempt to obtain money by fraud. Miss Jelila Smith said that she was clerk in charge at the Peckham branch of the South-Eastern district office. She had been in service eighteen years, and was accustomed to the cashing of postal orders. On Saturday last the prisoner called at the office at about eleven o'clock in the morning, and cashed two postal orders for 10s. 6d. and 4s. 6d. respectively. She gave half a sovereign and 5s. in silver. She was sure that the half-sovereign was a good one. The prisoner came into the office again at about three in the afternoon, and produced a gilt Jubilee sixpence, stating that she had given it him that morning for a half-sovereign. She examined the coin, and noticed at once that it was light in colour and weight, and had no ring. She told him that she was quite sure that she had not given it to him, and declined to exchange it, and he left the office, leaving it behind him. He returned in three-quarters of an hour, and again demanded a half-sovereign, and she referred him to the South-Eastern district postmaster, in Blackman-street. He said he would go and see the postmaster, but declined to take the coin with him. He came back between four and five, and asked her whether she had received a telegram from the postmaster instructing her to pay him. She said \"No.\" Telegrams addressed to Rye-lane would be delivered from her office. He said she would receive one, as he had seen the postmaster. He returned again, and said that there was a telegram intended for her which had been sent to the wrong office. She said she would send in a special report to the Postmaster, and he then asked for the sixpence; which she gave him. The prisoner said he must have been out of his mind. He was not aware of the consequences when he sent the telegram. Sidney Thomas Birkenshaw, clerk at London-bridge Station, gave evidence in support of Dr. Osborn's opening statement. Herbert Henry Greenslade, a messenger attached to the Peckham branch office, said that he encountered the prisoner, who told him that he knew what was in the message he was carrying, and that it was intended for the office down the street. He asked him to give him the telegram, but the witness declined. The South-Eastern district postmaster stated that he had never had any interview with the prisoner, and that the telegram had not been sent by his authority; and Mr. W. T. Edwards, of the Confidential Inquiry Department, deposed that when interrogated as to what he had done with the gilt sixpence the prisoner replied that he had changed it at a tobacconist's in High-street, Peckham, as half a sovereign. He said, respecting the telegram, that he did not know the consequences of it, and that if he had he should never have done such a trick. The prisoner was remanded.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3200810153.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 832, "total-output-tokens": 1045, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 4429, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
