Of late, it would appear, fortune has smiled upon Mr. William Ernest Rennless, jobmaster, of Warmley, near Bristol, and remembering that in the days when he was not so well off he had a brother \"somewhere in London,\" he decided to journey to the metropolis and endeavour to find him. From a friend he heard his brother was a barman, and \"was employed at a public-house near the Round House, Vauxhall.\" Many a public-house bar did Mr. Rennless search, but all to no purpose. Tired and weary, the man entered a house near Vauxhall-cross, and the desire for companionship and a sympathising friend induced Mr. Rennless to communicate the object of his visit to a stranger in the bar. Over many a glass did they mourn the loss of the brother, and whilst Mr. Rennless replenished the glasses the stranger aforesaid begged to be excused for one minute. On his return a few moments later he offered to assist the Bristolian in a further investigation, when at that moment an individual entered. Mr. Rennless in the newcomer fancied he saw a faint resemblance in features to the long-lost brother. Presently Mr. Rennless was observed shaking the newcomer vigorously by the hand, and announcing him to the whole company as the long-forgotten relative. To celebrate such an auspicious occasion of course more corks were drawn. Subsequently Mr. Rennless's \"brother\" and his friend volunteered to see the opulent Bristolian to his hotel. The way seemed long\u2014through a lot of dark courts and alleys, but his surprise gave way to downright astonishment when he found himself suddenly thrown to the ground and his pockets rifled of watch, chain, and money. The constable on the beat escorted him to the station, when Detective-sergeant Brogden was able to get from him a description of the assailants. Two men, named Glover (the long-lost \"brother\") and Delourney, were arrested, and when brought before Mr. Rennless he seemed unable to identify them; but Sergeant Brogden, after the accused had been placed in the cells, arranged that the gaoler should lock him in the adjoining apartment, where he overheard a conversation between the men which led to their being indicted for the assault and robbery. Glover was discharged, but Delourney was sentenced to three months' hard labour. None of the property was recovered.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3200810314.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 1154, "total-output-tokens": 572, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 2415, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
