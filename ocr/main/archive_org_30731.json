The eastern boundary is formed by the ridge of the Nargu Dh\u00e1r as far as Bajaura, then by the Be\u00e1s and Tirthan rivers to Manglaur, from which it runs almost due south to a point 5 miles south of the Jalauri Range when it follows the Bisna stream to the State of Suket. Its extreme length from Baijn\u00e1th on the north-west to the south-eastern corner on the Bisna is about 54 miles, and its breadth from the Dulchi Pass near Bajaura in Kulu to the Bil\u00e1spur border is some 33 miles.\n\nThe Be\u00e1s, which enters Mandi territory about the middle of the eastern border and leaves it a few miles north of the centre of its western boundary divides the State into two unequal portions of which the northern is the smaller. This part is again trisected by two great parallel ranges running north-west by south-east of which the eastern and higher called the Ghoghar-ki-Dh\u00e1r is continued across the Be\u00e1s and extends down into the south-western corner of the State. The south-eastern corner is formed by the western end of the great Jalauri Range, which throws out three main spurs from its northern slopes and forms the tract known as Mandi-Sar\u00e1j.\n\nOf the ranges the most important is the Ghoghar-ki-Dh\u00e1r which enters the State at Harab\u00e1gh at the centre of its northern border. It is a continuation of the great range which forms the western limit of Chhota Bang\u00e1hal. It is fertile and well-wooded, abounds in game and is famous for its honey. It also contains the salt quarries of Guma and Drang and slate is obtained in many places. The Nargu Range, which has an elevation of from 9,000 to 12,000 feet, is also well-wooded with pine, deodar, walnut, chestnut and box, and contains iron-mines which would be of great value were they more accessible.\n\nAlmost the whole area of the State drains into the river Be\u00e1s. It enters Mandi territory at the village of Larji where it is joined by the Sainj and Tirthan streams. Thence it flows westward with several sharp windings until it reaches the town of Mandi, the capital, which is situated on its left bank almost in the centre of the State. From the city the river after a northern course of a few miles again turns westward and leaves the State below Sandhol.\nIts principal tributaries on the north bank are the Ul, Luni and Rena; and on the south bank the Hansa, Tirthan, Janjheli, Jiuni, Suketi, Ranodi, Son and Bakhari.\n\nRising in the snowy ranges of Bara Banghal the Ul drains the valley between the Nargu and Ghoghar-ki-Dh\u00e1r and after a southerly course of some forty miles through the Choh\u00e1r Waziri and the Drang il\u00e1qa falls into the Be\u00e1s, 3 miles above the town of Mandi. As it runs in a deep gorge, between steep high banks its waters cannot be used for irrigation. The Luni rises on the western slopes of the Ghoghar-ki-Dh\u00e1r, near Urla, and flowing southward for about 10 miles falls into the Be\u00e1s a mile above the Rena. The Rena has its sources in the numerous streams which descend from Chhot\u00e1 Banghal and drains the valley which lies between the Ghoghar-ki-Dhar and its parallel range to the west, running southward in the State for about 10 miles through the Banghal and Ner Waziris.\n\nThe southern tributaries are more numerous. To the extreme east of the State the Hansa (or Bah) forms the boundary between Mandi and Pl\u00e1ch for some 8 miles, until it joins the Tirthan at Manglaur. Thence the united streams flow northwards, still forming the boundary of the State for another 6 miles, and fall into the Be\u00e1s where it turns sharply eastwards at Larji. The Jhanjheli rising in the Mangru Range runs through Mandi-Saraj and Pindoh for 20 miles to meet the Be\u00e1s at Bakh\u00e1l. Rising in the hills of Kamru N\u00e1g in the N\u00e1chan il\u00e1qa the Jiuni irrigates some 800 ghumaons there and in the Pindoh Waziri, and joins the Be\u00e1s a few miles above Mandi town. The Suketi or Suket Khad enters the State from Suket territory and becomes after its junction with the Ratti and Kansa streams a considerable volume of water. It then flows north until it falls into the Be\u00e1s close to the town of Mandi. The Ranodi rising in the R\u00fapru Hill irrigates some 150 ghumaons in the Tungal Waziri and after a northern course of about 11 miles falls into the Be\u00e1s at B\u00e1h\u00fa. The Son or Seon Khad (so called because gold is found in very small quantities in its bed) rises in the Sar\u00e1ka-Ghatta hill and running northward for some 15 miles enters the Be\u00e1s at the Kanda ferry. It irrigates the Waziris of Kaml\u00e1h and Anantpur. The B\u00e1kkar Khad rises in the Dewi-wah hills and flowing northward forms the boundary between the State and the Tahsil of Ham\u00edrpur, until it joins the Be\u00e1s at Sandhol. There is a proverb about this stream:\n\nBakkar Khad sab h\u00ed khadd\u00e1n di R\u00e1n\u00ed,\nHeonda dh\u00fap na teond\u00ed p\u00e1n\u00ed,\nBars\u00e1ti kih\u00e1n jind bach\u00e1n\u00ed.\n\n\"The Bakkar is the queen of all the streams. There is no sun in winter nor water in summer, and in the rains how can one save one's life?\"\nThe Sikandar Range rises from the boundary of the Suket, Bilaspur and Mandi States and runs northward for 50 miles being broken through by the river Be\u00e1s two marches north of Mandi town. On its eastern slope some 3 miles from the Suket border is the temple of Murari Devi. A mile from the temple is the fort of Bair-kot and another mile beyond the fort is a \"galu\" or pass on the old road leading to Hoshiarpur. South-west of the pass there is a \"pakka baoli\" or tank with a spring sending forth water sufficient to quench the thirst of many hundreds. Tradition relates that about 375 years before Akbar's reign, Sikandar Lodhi marching to the conquest of Kangra arrived at this spring, and near it and close to the temple of Murari Devi he founded a cantonment which remained in existence for some time. Since then the range has been known as Sikandar Dhar. No monument, save (it is said) the ruins of a tomb near by, remains to mark the site. The correctness of this derivation, however, is disputed.\n\nStory tells that in the tank south of the pass a stone bore the following inscription:\u2014Sikandar dhar na urar na par, \"the hill of Sikandar is not on this side nor on that.\" The meaning of these words was not known, but was supposed to indicate hidden treasure. About 22 or 23 years ago a potter of Hoshiarpur came to these hills to sell merchandise. On his way back he halted for the night at a place west of the pass, and near the spring. While driving a peg to tether his mules he heard a hollow sound and accordingly pitched his tent over the spot. During the night he dug the place and is supposed to have found a hidden treasure, which he loaded on his animals and carried home. It is also said that cultivators in the neighbourhood, while reclaiming land above the spring, have found pieces of swords and some square rupees.\n\nThere is also a kotha of pakka masonry near this pass, which is called a gurdwara of the Sikhs, because Guru Gobind Singh used to halt there whenever he set forth to pillage.\n\nThe following list gives the heights in feet above the sea of some important places and peaks in the Mandi State:\n\n| Place                        | Height |\n|------------------------------|--------|\n| Aiju Fort (highest part of the building) | 4,967  |\n| Maruri Dhar in Bangabal      | 4,278  |\n| Chabutra Halti Bangabal on high road | 3,853  |\n| Karanpur do. do. do.          | 6,075  |\n| Sui Dhar in Ner              | 8,960  |\n| Langot Dhar (above Guma)     | 7,522  |\n| Guma village (above salt mines) | 5,183  |\n| Bunga Dhar in Chohar         | 6,526  |\n| Badwani                      | 6,700  |\n| Jhattingri                   | 6,610  |\n| Phutakal (above Drang)       | 7,184  |\n| Janjarilla (west of Bhubu-ki-Jot) | 11,522 |\n| Jaon Dhar do. do. do.        | 9,938  |\n| Gatiar                       | 9,651  |\n| Chyira Dhar (in N\u00e1chan)     | 10,283 |\n| Shikari Devi                 | 11,060 |\n\n| Place                        | Height |\n|------------------------------|--------|\n| Cheru (in N\u00e1chan)            | 10,134 |\n| Dabkar (in Pindoh)           | 6,150  |\n| Jiula do.                    | 5,929  |\n| Joker do.                    | 5,290  |\n| Sarogi (in Hat Garh)         | 5,000  |\n| Miroee                       | 3,500  |\n| Kaunwal Dhar (in Pichhit)    | 4,106  |\n| Shy\u00e1ma K\u00e1l\u00ed Temple (in Mandi town) | 3,000  |\n| Naina Devi (in Bagre)        | 6,350  |\n| Si\u00e1h Dhar do.                | 6,173  |\n| Sikandra Dhar                | 6,000  |\n| Marw\u00e1h Devi                  | 6,689  |\n| Mor\u00e1ri Devi (in H\u00e1tili)      | 6,149  |\n| Kamlah Fort                  | 4,477  |\n| Galma                        | 3,004  |\n| Bh\u00e1mla                       | 3,908  |\nOn the geology of the country Mr. H. H. Hayden writes:\n\n\"The State lies partly on rocks belonging to the central Himalayan zone of unknown age and partly on tertiary shales and sandstones. The rocks of the central zone consist of slates, conglomerates and limestones, which have been referred to the infra-Blaini and Blaini and Krol groups of the Simla area. The sandstones and shales of the Sub-Himalayan zone belong to the Sirmur series of lower tertiary age and to the Siwalik series (upper tertiary). The most important mineral of the State is rock salt. The age of the salt is quite uncertain: but it appears to be connected with the tertiary beds.\"\n\nA list of fruit and forest trees will be found in Chapter II, Section C. As in the hills generally, medicinal plants are common and form a valuable source of income to the people. They are of the ordinary hill kinds, e.g., violets (banafsha):\n\n- *amla* (Phyllanthus Emblia, Brandis, p. 454)\n- *ajwain* (Ficus, linum ajowan, Stewart, p. 107)\n- *chirreta* or gentian (Agalbotes sp., Stewart, p. 147)\n- *saunf*, fennel (Foeniculum vulgare, Stewart, p. 107)\n- *hard* (Terminalia chebula)\n- *bahega* (Terminalia bellerica, Brandis, p. 222)\n- *jhaq* (Tamarix gallica, Brandis, p. 20)\n- *karu* (Albizzia procera, Brandis, p. 175)\n- *kakkarsingi* (P. integerrima, Brandis, p. 122)\n- *pit-papra* (Fumaria parvifolia, Stewart, p. 11)\n- *gulaj* (Tinospora cordifolia, Stewart, p. 6)\n- *Brahni*, elm (Ulmus campestris, Brandis, p. 483)\n- *bhangra*, mistletoe (Viscum album, Brandis, p. 392)\n- *jal bhangra* (The trailing lalipta)\n- *mohra*, aconite (A. ferox, Stewart, p. 1)\n- *amaltas* or Indian Laburnum (Cassia Fistula, Brandis, p. 164)\n- *bilgiri* (Acute maruntos, Stewart, p. 28)\n- *Kashmiri patha* or Kashmiri tobacco\n- *chokri*, rhubarb (Polygonum sp., Stewart, p. 186)\n- *mehdi*, henna (Lawsonia atba)\n- *sonthi*, ginger\n- *bannha* (titex tegundo, Stewart, p. 166)\n- *basuti* (Adhatoda rasica, Stewart, p. 164)\n- *barin* (Acorus catamus, or Sweet Ledge, Stewart, p. 236)\n\n---\n\n(1) See Medlicott: On the Sub-Himalayan Range between the Ganges and Ravi Mem. G. S. I., III, pt. 2.\nAs regards the bannha, barin, and basuti there is a proverb, \"jis mulk men bannha basuti barin, us mulk men admi kyun marin,\" 'how should a man die in a country where these three are found?' The nagdun (Staplylaco Emodi, Stewart, p. 40) is found at high elevations where snow falls. Its twigs are kept in the house to drive away snakes.\n\nFAUNA.\n\nThe forests of Mandi abound with game. Of the larger animals the leopard, black bear, hyena and various kinds of deer are common. Leopards are very destructive to the flocks of sheep and goats which pasture on the hill-sides, and have been known to attack men. Jackals, foxes and wild pigs are met with in the lower ranges. The common hill monkey and langurs are found in Kamlah, musk deer in Saraj and Chohar, barking deer (kakkar) and gural generally throughout the State. Duck, geese and snipe are shot on the banks of the Beas, jungle fowl and quail in the lower valleys, and various kinds of pheasants in the higher hills. Snakes are not unknown in the rainy season. Locusts are seldom seen and very rarely in large numbers, though they visited Mandi in 1889 and 1890.\n\nThe river Beas and the Suket, Ratti and Rena streams contain many fish. They are usually caught by means of nets, but occasionally with hook and line. It is estimated that about 300 persons are engaged in and supported by river industries. Of these, half are boatmen and men who work the darus or inflated skins, and half are Niaryas who are employed in searching for gold in sandy beds of streams. They all supplement their larder and their income by catching fish.\n\nCLIMATE AND RAINFALL.\n\nThe monsoon generally breaks about the third week in June, and heavy rain continues on and off throughout July and August, often for several days together. The winter rains which fall in December and January are also very severe. Snow falls on the higher hills, at times descending as low as the town of Mandi. The crops in both harvests depend largely on a good winter rainfall for the melting snows provide the copious streams of water required to sow and plough the rice fields. The rainfall is exceptionally heavy on the upper ranges of the Nargu and Ghoghar-ki-Dhar hills.\n\nThe difference in elevation throughout the State gives it a very varied climate. Except in the capital which is surrounded by hills, and in the western districts which are not more than 2,000 feet above sea-level, the heat is seldom excessive.\nThe most unhealthy time of the year is the latter part of autumn when the inundated soil is drying. In the lower valleys malaria is common and in August and September intermittent and bilious fevers and bowel complaints are very prevalent. In winter the climate of Mandi town and the Ballh valley is far too cold for weak constitutions. In the mornings from the middle of December to the end of January, a white fog, very dense and cold, rises from the Be\u00e1s and Suket rivers, lasting far into the day. Cases of pneumonia are frequent in these months. Diarrhoea and enlargement of the spleen are somewhat common diseases, and the people are generally weak and pallid.\n\nSaraj, N\u00e1chan, Choh\u00e1r and Sanor, being on a higher level, are free from malaria and the inhabitants of these parts show great aversion from venturing down to the lower valleys during the fever season. They have a common belief that the smell of the ripening dh\u00e1n or \"paddy\" crops produces fever.\n\nThe climate of the country bordering on Ham\u00edrpur Tahsil is comparatively healthy and the people of Hatli, Anantpur, Kaml\u00e1h and Sandhol are above the average height, strong and hard-working.\n\nSection B.\u2014History.\n\nA complete history of Mandi from about 1200 A.D. to 1870 A.D. is to be found in Griffin's \"The R\u00e1j\u00e1s of the Punjab.\" This chapter is practically a resume of Griffin's account (with a few corrections and extra notes) to which is added a description of the administration of the State from 1870 to 1905.\n\nThe gross annual revenue of the State amounts to nearly Rs. 4,50,000. The ruling family in Mandi is R\u00e1jp\u00fat of the Chandra Bansi tribe and is known as Mandial. \"Sen\" is the name borne by the reigning Chief, the younger members of the family are called \"Singh.\"\n\nR\u00e1ja S\u00e1r Sen, the common ancestor of the ruling houses of Mandi and Suket, belonged to the ancient Gaur dynasty which succeeded the P\u00e1ls in Bengal about the middle of the tenth century.(1) The most eminent ruler of the Sena dynasty was Lakshman Sen. He is said to have extended his conquests to Kanauj, Nep\u00e1l and Orissa and to have founded Gaur in M\u00e1lda, which he himself called Lakhnauti after his own name. One of\n\n(1) In the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica the eleventh century is given but Lethbridge mentions a Sena king named Adisura who reigned in 964 A.D. Lethbridge is probably correct as the Sen\u00e1s reigned for about two centuries before they were conquered by the Slave kings.\nhis descendants, Ballala Sen chose Nadiya (near the junction of the Bhagirathi and Jalangi rivers) as a place of residence. S\u00far Sen, the last Sena ruler of Bengal, was driven out of Nadiya by Bakhtiar Khilji, a general of the Slave king Kutb-ud-din, about 1198-99, and died in exile at Allahabad. His son R\u00fap Sen left Allahabad at his father's death, and went to reside at Rupar in the Ambala District. Their old enemies however were still unsatisfied and in 1210 marched to the assault of R\u00fapar. In the ensuing struggle R\u00fap Sen lost his life and his sons were compelled to flee to the hills for refuge. Here they established themselves, Bir Sen becoming ruler of Suket, Gur Sen of Keonthal and Han\u00far Sen of the Kishtwar country.\n\nAbout 1330 A.D. in the time of S\u00e1hu Sen, the eighth ruler of Suket from Bir Sen, a younger brother named Bah\u00fa Sen quarreled with the R\u00e1ja and left Suket to reside in Manglaur, Kulu. His descendants lived there for eleven generations until Karanchan Sen, then head of the family, was killed fighting with the Kulu R\u00e1ja. His R\u00e1ni, a daughter of the Chief of Seokot in Mandi, although pregnant, was forced to take flight. She lost her way in the dense oak forest; and night coming on, fell exhausted beneath a \"b\u00e1n\" tree where to her a son was born named B\u00e1n or B\u00e1no. The R\u00e1na of Seokot having no male heirs recognized his daughter's son as his successor, and on the death of his grandfather, the boy B\u00e1n Sen became Chief of Seokot. He enlarged his inheritance and built himself a new residence at Bhi\u00fali, four miles above the present town of Mandi. Afterwards his son, Kali\u00e1n Sen, bought Batauhli across the river from Mandi and there constructed a palace, the ruins of which may still be seen. Very little of the history of the State is known until we come to Ajbar Sen, 19th in descent from Bah\u00fa Sen, who, in 1527, founded the town of Mandi. Chatar Sen, his son, succeeded in 1534. Then come Sahib Sen and Narayan Sen who vigorously extended the boundaries of the R\u00e1j, followed by Keshab Sen and Hari Sen of whom little is known beyond their names.\n\nThe following are the names of the first 24 Chiefs of Mandi:\n\n| 1 | Bah\u00fa Sen.          | 13 | Kaki\u00e1n Sen.       |\n|---|-------------------|----|------------------|\n| 2 | N\u00fan Sen.          | 14 | H\u00edra Sen.        |\n| 3 | Nirhabat Sen.     | 15 | Dharitri Sen.    |\n| 4 | Kahabat Sen.      | 16 | Narendar Sen.    |\n| 5 | Suhawan Sen.      | 17 | Harjai Sen.      |\n| 6 | Bir Sen.          | 18 | Dilawar Sen.     |\n| 7 | Samodar Sen.      | 19 | Ajbar Sen.       |\n| 8 | Keshab Sen.       | 20 | Chhatar Sen.     |\n| 9 | Mangal Sen.       | 21 | Sahib Sen.       |\n| 10| Jai Sen.          | 22 | Narayan Sen.     |\n| 11| Kanchan Sen.      | 23 | Keshab Sen.      |\n| 12| B\u00e1n Sen.          | 24 | Nari Sen.        |\nThe following genealogical table shows the descent from R\u00e1ja Hari Sen of R\u00e1ja Bhaw\u00e1ni Sen, the present ruling Chief:\n\nHARI SEN, d. 1623.\n\nRaja Suraj Sen, d. 1658.\nRaja Shiam Sen, d. 1673.\n\nGur Sen, d. 1696.\nD\u00e1n Chand.\n\nSidh Sen, d. 1758.\nM\u00e1nak Chand.\nJippu (illegitimate).\n\nJow\u00e1la Sen, d. 1758 approximately.\n\nShamsheer Sen, d. 1782.\nDhur Jatiya.\nSurma Sen.\nKalesar.\n\nIsri Sen, d. 1826.\nZ\u00e1h\u00edm Sen.\nT\u00f3gha Singh.\nDedar Singh.\n\nBaghunath Singh (illegitimate).\nBh\u00fap Singh.\nKanh Singh.\nSher Singh.\n\nGanga Singh.\nBichitar Singh.\nAnt\u00e1r Singh.\n\nPr\u00e1kram Singh.\n\nBalbir Sen (illegitimate), d. 1851.\nRatan Singh (illegitimate).\nKap\u00far Singh (illegitimate).\nBh\u00e1g Singh (illegitimate).\n\nPrem Singh illegitimate.\nKanh Singh.\n\nPhannu.\nThholu illegitimate.\n\nBejai Sen, d. 1902.\nPradhan Singh (illegitimate).\nM\u00e1n Singh (illegitimate).\n\nRaja Bhaw\u00e1ni Sen (present chief).\nKishen Singh (illegitimate).\n\nFrom R\u00e1ja Suraj Sen\u2019s succession in 1623 the events of Mandi history are related in greater detail. Suraj Sen was an ambitious Chief and sought to extend his territories at the expense of his neighbours. An attack on the R\u00e1ja of Bhang\u00fal led to a coalition between the latter and his brother-in-law, R\u00e1ja M\u00e1n Singh of Kulu. Suraj Sen was defeated by their combined forces and the boundaries of Mandi fixed at the villages of Bir and Aiju. Later Suraj Sen again invaded Kulu and again suffered defeat. The Kulu troops overran Mandi and seized the Salt Mines of Guma and Drang which provided the greater portion of Mandi revenue. Suraj Sen was compelled to sue for peace and had to pay all the expenses of the war, the boundary remaining as previously fixed. With the Goleria R\u00e1ja he was equally unsuccessful and the Kangra troops on two occasions sacked his capital.\nSuraj Sen built the celebrated hill fort of Kamla in 1625 and also the palace in Mandi known as Damdama. He is said to have introduced a system of fixed revenue assessments of grain and cash, but no details are known.\n\nAs Suraj Sen's 18 sons had all died during his lifetime, he despaired of an heir and caused a silver image to be made which he called Madho Rao and to which he assigned his kingdom (1638 A.D.). His brother Shi\u00e1m Sen who succeeded him and reigned for 15 years, is best known by the temple of Shi\u00e1ma K\u00e1li which he built in Mandi. On an invasion of Kah\u00far by the Mughals Shi\u00e1m Sen went to the assistance of T\u00e1ra Chand and appears to have been successful for land known as \"barto\" was granted afterwards in mu\u00e1fi to those who took part in the campaign.\n\nGur Sen died in 1686 and was succeeded by Sidh Sen who was a great warrior, and added large territories to his State at the expense of Suket, Bhang\u00e1l and Kulu. He treacherously murdered his father-in-law R\u00e1ja Pirthi P\u00e1l of Bhang\u00e1l when on a visit to Mandi. The head of the unfortunate R\u00e1ja is said to be under a pillar or pedestal in the centre of the tank constructed by Sidh Sen in front of his palace. The pillar at the top has space for a lamp which is still lighted every evening.\n\nTowards the end of the 17th century Govind Singh, the tenth Sikh Guru, visited Mandi where the R\u00e1ja entertained him hospitably. The Guru's promise however\u2014\n\nMandi ko jab lutenge\nAsm\u00e1ni gole chh\u00fatengne\n\nhas never been fulfilled.\n\nDuring this reign Jippu, an illegitimate brother of the previous R\u00e1ja, acted as Waz\u00edr of the State. He was obviously a man of considerable ability as he inaugurated the revenue system still in force, and framed rules limiting the expenditure on betrothals and weddings. He further introduced a system of state loans, whereby a man could borrow grain from the State stores, the grain being repaid at the next harvest plus saw\u00e1i, i.e., \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\)th the amount borrowed. Failing repayment a fresh bond was written every fourth year in which the principal was doubled. One paisa per rupee per mensem (nearly 20 per cent.) was charged as interest on cash loans. During this period the land revenue was paid chiefly in kind. If the fixed cash revenue demand could not be paid in silver, the current copper coins were received but with an addition of three takkas, i.e., 1\u00bd annas per rupee. Jippu remained as Chief Minister till his death when Dhur Jattiya the R\u00e1ja's brother appears to have become influential.\n\nThe Mandi chronicles relate that Jow\u00e1la Sen reigned three years. This appears to be a mistake. Griffin notes that he died in 1758. It appears however that he really died about 1752 or six years before his father.\nJudging from the stories related in a T\u00e2nkri history of Mandi, Shamser Sen must have been of weak intellect, capricious and cruel. During his reign the Mughals invaded the Kamla district but retired without doing much damage, the fort proving too strong for them to attack.\n\nGriffin does not refer to this R\u00e2ja although vernacular records speak highly of him. He was apparently a headstrong man with a violent temper. The result was that the Mians (his relations) and the officials had a healthy fear of him and, as the chronicles naively remark, \u201cin his reign all Mians were powerless and the State prospered.\u201d Has these pregnant words been laid to heart by his successors the State would have been saved much trouble. Bairagi Ram, Brahman, was his Waz\u00eer. It is interesting to note that Surma Sen paid yearly tribute to the Mughal Emperor, viz., Rs. 500 cash, a musk deer, a yak-tail, a pony and a hawk.\n\nDuring the minority of Isri Sen, who was only five years old at his father\u2019s death, the fortunes of the State were reduced to their lowest ebb. About 1792, R\u00e2ja Sans\u00e2r Chand of Kangra seized an opportunity to invade Mandi and plunder the town. Isri Sen was captured and carried off to Kangra. The rich district of Hatli was handed over to Suket, Chohar allotted to Kulu, and Anantpur kept by the victor himself, while the State thus impoverished, was ordered to pay an annual tribute of a lakh of rupees. In 1805, Sans\u00e2r Chand pursuing his victorious career turned to the conquest of Kahlur. Its R\u00e2ja invoked the aid of the Gurkhas who had already overrun the country from the Gogra to the Satlaj. In May 1806, the allies defeated the Katoch R\u00e2ja at Mahal Mori, released Isri Sen and, on submission to the Gurkha Amar Singh Thapa, restored him to his kingdom. The result however was to bring about the interference of a far more powerful and dangerous enemy, for R\u00e2ja Sans\u00e2r Chand, reduced to extremities, besought the assistance of the Sikhs. In August 1809, after a protracted struggle, the army sent by Ranjit Singh defeated the Gurkhas and compelled them to abandon all their conquests on this side of the Satlaj. Sardar Desa Singh Majithia occupied Kangra Fort on behalf of Ranjit Singh, and was appointed Nazim or Superintendent of all the Hill States including Mandi. R\u00e2ja Isri Sen recovered his lost districts but was compelled to pay a yearly tribute of Rs. 80,000. This sum was raised to one lakh in 1815 but again reduced by judicious bribery to Rs. 50,000 in 1816 or 1817.\n\nOn the death of Isri Sen without legitimate male heirs, his brother Z\u00e2lim Sen, who had perpetually intrigued against him, succeeded to the throne. He paid a lakh of rupees as succession duty to Lahore, and annual tribute of Rs. 75,000. Some years before his death he made over the administration of the State to his nephew Balbir Sen who was not only illegitimate but also one of the younger sons of the late R\u00e2ja. The Lahore Court was only\ninduced by the payment of a very large sum by Z\u00e1lim Sen to recognise Balb\u00edr Sen as the successor to the Mandi Gaddi.\n\nIn June 1839 M\u00e1har\u00e1ja Ranjit Singh died. The troops of the Khalsa were dangerous to their masters when not kept in active employment, and accordingly, though Mandi had not in any way offended, the reduction of the State was determined on. The Sikhs led by General Ventura occupied Mandi and captured the Kamla Fort after a poor resistance. Balb\u00edr Sen, taken prisoner during the campaign, was sent to Amritsar from whence, on his release in 1841, he returned to find Ghul\u00e1m Mohi-ud-din, the Sikh Governor, real ruler in his State.\n\nThe tyranny of the Sikhs was intolerable and in 1845, before the beginning of the Sikh War, Balb\u00edr Sen had opened negotiations with the British Government. After the Khalsa was crushed at Sobraon, the allegiance of Mandi was formally offered to and accepted by the British Government (24th October 1846). The following is a translation of the sanad given on that date by the Governor-General.\n\nWhereas, by the treaty concluded between the British and Sikh Governments, on the 19th March 1846, the hill country has come into the possession of the Honourable Company, and whereas R\u00e1ja Balb\u00edr Sen, Chief of Mandi, the highly dignified, evinced his sincere attachment and devotion to the British Government: the State of Mandi, comprised within the same boundaries as at the commencement of the British occupation, together with full administrative powers within the same, is now granted by the British Government to him and the heirs male of his body by his R\u00e1n\u00ed from generation to generation. On failure of such heirs, any other male heir who may be proved to the British Government to be next of kin to the R\u00e1ja shall obtain the above State with administrative powers.\n\nBe it known to the R\u00e1ja that the British Government shall be at liberty to remove any one from the Gaddi of Mandi who may prove to be of worthless character and incapable of properly conducting the administration of his State, and to appoint such other nearest heir of the R\u00e1ja to succeed him as may be capable of the administration of the State and entitled to succeed. The R\u00e1ja or any one as above described who may succeed him, shall abide by the following terms entered in this sanad, viz.:\n\n1. The Raja shall pay annually into the treasury of Simla and Subathu one lakh of Company\u2019s rupees as nazrana by two instalments, the first instalment on the 1st June and the second instalment on 1st November.\n\n2. He shall not levy tolls and duties on goods imported and exported but shall consider it incumbent on him to protect bankers and traders within his State.\n3. He shall construct roads within his territory not less than 12 feet in width and keep them in repair.\n\n4. He shall pull down and level the forts of Kamalgarh and Nantpur, and never attempt to rebuild them.\n\n5. On the breaking out of disturbances, he shall, together with his troops and hill porters, whenever required, join the British army, and be ready to execute whatever orders may be issued to him by the British authorities and supply provisions according to his means.\n\n6. He shall refer to the British Courts any dispute which may arise between him and any other Chief.\n\n7. In regard to the duties on the iron and salt mines, etc., in the territory of Mandi, rules shall be laid down after consultation with the Superintendent of the Hill States, and these rules shall not be departed from.\n\n8. The R\u00e1ja shall not alienate any portion of the lands of the said territory without the knowledge and consent of the British Government, nor transfer it by way of mortgage.\n\n9. He shall also put an end to the practice of slave dealing, satti, female infanticide, and the burning or drowning of lepers, which are opposed to British laws, that no one in future shall venture to revive them.\n\nIt behoves the R\u00e1ja not to encroach beyond the boundaries of his State or the territory of any other chief, but to abide by the terms of this sanad, and to adopt such measures as may tend to the welfare of his people, the prosperity of his country, and the improvement of the soil, and ensure the administration of even-handed justice to the aggrieved, the restoration to the people of their just rights, and the security of the roads. He shall not subject his people to extortion, but keep them always contented. The subjects of the State of Mandi shall regard the R\u00e1ja and his successors as above described to be the sole proprietor of that territory, and never refuse to pay him the revenue due by them, but remain obedient to him and act up to his just orders.\n\nAt the death of his father Bejai Sen was only four years of age. A Council of Regency was appointed, consisting of Wazir Gos\u00e1on, the all-powerful Prime Minister, Mi\u00e1n Bh\u00e1g Singh and Prohit Shib Shankar. In two years however it was found necessary to re-organize the Council and almost the entire control of the administration, judicial and financial, was given to Wazir Gos\u00e1on. This arrangement worked well for some years and the State greatly benefited.\n\nBut the training of the R\u00e1ja had been almost entirely neglected. Griffin says, \"Not only was the education of the R\u00e1ja neglected, but both the Prohit (Shib Shankar) and Wazir Gos\u00e1on...\"\nwinked at, even if they did not encourage excesses which seriously injured the constitution of the young prince.\n\nIn 1861 the Prohit was banished to Kangra and the Wazir fined Rs. 2,000.\n\nIn 1863 Mr. Clark, an Officer of the Educational Department, was appointed to superintend the Raja's education.\n\nWhen the Raja became of age and took charge of his State, the outlook was bright. Various works of utility were undertaken, including a road from Baijnath to Kulu, dak bungalows, a post office connected with the Government Postal Department, etc. Unfortunately the Raja proved to be of a weak vacillating disposition and was jealous of his strong Wazir. He was ruled by his zenana and by men who cared little for the State but much for their own profit.\n\nThe administration fell into the greatest confusion and the British Government found it necessary in 1870 to appoint Mr. E. Harrison, B. C. S., as Adviser to the Raja. This Officer put the State in such good order that, on his appointment to a higher post in 1872, administration progressed smoothly until 1879. In that year Colonel W. G. Davies, then Commissioner of Jullundur, with the assent of the Raja, drew up a scheme of administration under which a council of three members, Mi\u00e1n M\u00e1n Singh, Padha Jiwa Nand and Munshi Ganga Singh, was appointed. By the end of 1880, the system broke down, the Council was removed and Wazir Uttam Singh, dismissed in 1879, recalled.\n\nUttam Singh did good work until the year 1888 when he was attacked by paralysis. He died in October of that year.\n\nThe Tahsildar, Jowahar Mal, was appointed Wazir, but the hillmen showed signs of discontent, and the Raja early in 1889 asked for the assistance of a British official. Mr. H. J. Maynard of the Indian Civil Service was appointed Counsellor to the Raja, and during the year or so he was in Mandi, he effected great improvements.\n\nHe left at the end of March 1890, and at his suggestion the Raja engaged Mr. C. E. Fendall as Superintendent of Works to help in the forest administration especially, and to look after the roads, salt mines and beg\u00e1r labour generally. Appellate judicial work was also entrusted to him.\n\nIn June 1893, there was another disturbance among the Saraj hillmen, who were dissatisfied with Wazir Jowala Singh. The introduction of buffalo lymph for vaccination was seized upon as a pretext for showing open discontent, Jowala Singh was removed and Mi\u00e1n Udham Singh, a Rajput, appointed. The period from 1894\u20141900 was an unlucky one for Mandi. Two sons were born to the Raja but died in childhood. The Raja was constantly ill and developed cataract in both eyes. He\nwas therefore totally unable to look after his State, and unfortunately Udham Singh and Mr. Fendall did not work together. Both were removed in 1901 and Padha Jiwa Nand recalled from Jodhpore State where he was a Member of Council.\n\nBijai Sen died in December 1902 after long continued ill-health. Bhawani Sen, in default of legitimate heirs, was recognized as his successor by the British Government and formally installed by the Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab at Mandi in November 1903, while still a student at the Aitchison Chiefs' College, Lahore. The administration of the State was entrusted to Mr. T. Millar of the Indian Civil Service who remained in Mandi until October 1905 when the Raja was formerly invested with full powers by Mr. H. A. Anderson, c.s.i., Commissioner and Superintendent, Jullundur Division.\n\nThe late R\u00e1ja was an orthodox Hindu and very conservative. He was generous to a fault and unscrupulous persons took full advantage of this. He was beloved by his subjects generally.\n\nNotwithstanding the vicissitudes of the last 50 years, there have been many improvements made in the State.\n\n1. In 1868 the Baijn\u00e1th-Kulu and Baijn\u00e1th-Mandi roads were constructed and d\u00e1k bungalows built.\n\n2. In 1878 the Empress bridge over the Be\u00e1s at Mandi was built at a cost of Rs. 1,00,000.\n\n3. In 1881 the Sikandra-Mandi road, 25 miles long, was completed.\n\n4. In 1888 the Mandi-Kulu road, about 81 miles long, was constructed.\n\n5. In 1903 an excellent hospital was completed at Mandi and put under the charge of an Assistant Surgeon.\n\nThe Mandi State School, under a trained and experienced Head Master and supported by an adequate staff, promises to be popular.\n\nMandi is a leading Hill-state, standing 6th in order of precedence among the Punjab Chiefs. One lakh of rupees annually is paid as tribute to the British Government.

Their complexion is fair, but in stature they seldom exceed the middle height. The features of the higher classes are refined and well-formed. The Rajputs are famous for good-looks. The agricultural classes are of a tawny colour and very simple in their habits. Submissive, shy and reserved, they resent abusive language, but mild words will turn them into slaves and they will do any service to please one. They are not hospitable to outsiders and usually dislike them, but are generally affectionate among themselves. They are very fond of the hills and their own country, and will not undertake any enterprise, however profitable, if it obliges them to leave home. They have a bad opinion of the plains and of their people, where, according to their ideas, fever is common and thefts committed. They are very credulous and the stars are consulted for any public affair and every private undertaking. All misfortune or sickness is attributed to the malice of some local deity and chelas are consulted; who by whirling round, or by flogging themselves with chains, get into an exhausted state, and gasp out brief oracular answers. Magic and witchcraft and the existence of witches and sorcerers are firmly believed in. The hill-people believe in witchcraft and will point out witches who have destroyed children. If an epidemic disease or other misfortune befall a village, the chela or disciple is consulted, and he points out some woman as the witch. If the woman confesses, she is purified by the chela, the sacrifice of a goat being performed in the ceremony. But if she deny the accusation she will be tried by ordeal, that by water or hot iron being the principal forms in use.\n\nRajputs are fond of field sports and frequently hunt the wild animals of the hills. Hillmen are generally cowardly and not as strong, industrious or enterprising as the zamindars of the plains. They are very fond of music and take great pleasure in going to fairs. The lower castes drink till they are tipsy. As a rule they are truthful and in the shrine of Deva will never lie if put on their oath. The most solemn of all oaths is the Raja ke drohi, and a person encroaching on another's field is often checked by it. Serious consequences are involved if an oath thus taken is not regarded, and punishment is demanded for this offence in addition to that for the offence originally committed. In Saraj men and women dance together forming a circle, drummers and musicians playing in the centre. The residents of the hills are very dirty in person, but hardy and able to carry great loads. They themselves work at carpentry, and can hew down trees into timber and carry it on their shoulders with the help of neighbours, to build their huts. They shear their sheep and make cloth. They are also road-makers and work as labourers on new roads. They need cash only to pay their revenue, and to earn this, work on the roads, or in the forests, or sell their sheep, wool, and potatoes. Those living on\nthe borders of Ham\u00edrpur are a more industrious people. Large numbers of the R\u00e1jp\u00fats of Hatli, Kaml\u00e1h and Sandhol are in the military service of the British Government. The people of Anantpur are mostly employed in the service of the State. The Chautru peons of the Kotw\u00e1l\u00ed belong to this pargana and the Dhart\u00fas of the Wazir's court are residents of Dhartain in the same pargana. The agricultural classes are intelligent, but withal very ignorant. Reading or writing is almost unknown, and with a few exceptions the masses are quite illiterate and extremely ignorant.\n\nThe residents of the town of Mandi are quick-witted but slothful and luxurious, fond of wearing good clothes, quarrelsome and jealous of their neighbours' riches. They pass their leisure hours in idle amusements, and those of them who are dismissed from any office under Government generally intrigue against the officials.\n\nThey are remarkable for their strict adherence to the ancient customs, and spend large sums on the occasion of births of children, marriages and deaths. This leads them to extravagance and poverty.\n\nAll the natives of the State love and respect their ruler. They consider their R\u00e1ja a superhuman being and an incarnation of Vishnu. The people of the villages, whenever they pay a visit to the town, consider it incumbent on them to see the R\u00e1ja riding on his jh\u00e1pan for his morning or evening airing. Many are accustomed to say grace for the R\u00e1ja after their daily food. Khadha pid\u00e1 kit\u00e1 chain, jug jug jive R\u00e1ja Bije Sain. 'We have taken our dinner and are in peace, long live R\u00e1ja Bije Sain.'\n\nLitigation is increasing with the establishment of Law Courts. The natives of the town almost all marry their daughters in the town.\n\nThe State has a density of 154 persons to the square mile which is high for a hill country and exceeds that of the K\u00e1ngra District (80) but falls behind that of K\u00e1ngra Proper (200). It is 10th in respect of density on total area among all the Native States and 1st among the Hill States.\n\nExcluding the town of Mandi (population 8,144), the State contains 146 villages or garhs and 943 hamlets or chaks as noted in the margin.\n\n| Village       | Population |\n|---------------|------------|\n| Nagar Mandi   | 210        |\n| Chhechhiot    | 196        |\n| Gop\u00e1lpar     | 235        |\n| Harab\u00e1gh     | 302        |\n| Total         | 943        |\n\nThe capital of Mandi has increased by 18 per cent. since 1891. The average population of the villages is 114 souls.\n\nOf the total population 95 per cent. live in the villages.\n\nThe figures in the margin show the population of the State according to the results of the Census of 1901 as well as those of the previous years.\nThere is thus shown to have taken place an increase of 19,906 or 13\u00b78 per cent., between 1881 and 1891, and a further increase, between 1891 and 1901, of 7,122 or 4\u00b72 per cent., giving a total increase between 1881 and 1901 of 27,028 or 18 per cent.\n\nThe cause of the enormous increase in the decade 1881-91 was that the Census of 1881 was taken on the date when the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Mandi had left the State with a large following for Suket to be married there and in 1891, previously to the enumeration, a considerable number of Suketis had come to Mandi in search of forest labour, and there was a great influx of immigrants from the District of Kangra.\n\nThe following table shows the effect of migration on the population of the Mandi State according to the Census of 1901:\n\n| IMMIGRANTS | Persons | Males | Females |\n|------------|---------|-------|---------|\n| From within the Punjab and North-West Frontier Province | 7,578 | 4,169 | 3,409 |\n| From the rest of India | 609 | 354 | 255 |\n| From the rest of Asia and other countries | 217 | 129 | 88 |\n| Total immigrants | 8,404 | 4,652 | 3,752 |\n\n| EMIGRANTS | Persons | Males | Females |\n|-----------|---------|-------|---------|\n| To within the Punjab and North-West Frontier Province | 9,878 | 4,350 | 5,528 |\n| To the rest of India | 140 | 120 | 20 |\n| Total emigrants | 10,018 | 4,470 | 5,548 |\n| Excess + or defect \u2014 of immigrants over emigrants | -1,614 | +182 | -1,769 |\n\nThe bulk of the immigration is from the Districts and States in India noted in the margin.

Taking the figures for intra-imperial migration in India both within the Punjab and to or from other Provinces in India we have the marginal data.\n\nThe migrations from the Hoshiarpur District, and from Jammu, Bashahr, and N\u00e1l\u00e1garh States to the Capital of Mandi were a remarkable feature of the Census of 1901. The immigration from Hoshiarpur is due to the opening of the Una-Mandi road. The import of country-made cloth is increasing in the market of Mandi, and along with it many traders from the Una and Garhshankar Tahsils of Hoshiarpur have settled in the town. G\u00fajars from Jammu have largely settled in the Mandi forests.\n\nWithin the last five years some fifty families have immigrated from the Bashahr State and the Simla District. They make a living by weaving and other work.\n\nThe figures for age, sex and civil condition are given in detail in Part B.\n\nThe following statement shows the age distribution of 10,000 persons of both sexes:\n\n| Age period | Males | Females | Persons | Age period | Males | Females | Persons |\n|------------|-------|---------|---------|------------|-------|---------|---------|\n| Infants under 1 | 164 | 158 | 322 | 25 and under 30 | 446 | 431 | 877 |\n| 1 and under | 60 | 62 | 122 | 30 | 35 | 436 | 870 |\n| 2 | 124 | 129 | 253 | 35 | 40 | 319 | 589 |\n| 3 | 130 | 134 | 264 | 40 | 45 | 382 | 649 |\n| 4 | 114 | 119 | 233 | 45 | 50 | 200 | 348 |\n| 5 | 626 | 599 | 1,225 | 50 | 55 | 261 | 474 |\n| 10 | 644 | 522 | 1,166 | 55 | 60 | 88 | 149 |\n| 15 | 496 | 461 | 957 | 60 and over | 372 | 311 | 683 |\n\nBirths and deaths are not registered in this State.\n\nSomething has already been said on the subject of disease under Climate in Section A above, but the following remarks may be added. In B\u00e1gi t\u00e1chh, in the wasiri of Sar\u00e1j, bordering on Kulu Sar\u00e1j, goitre is common, and no one is free from it in the villages of Mani and Salano in that tract. Visitations of cholera have not been unknown in the lower valleys. It threatened the country in 1882 and 1885. Small-pox too is much dreaded, and the people are very careful to avoid the contagion. Of late years both vaccination and inoculation have greatly reduced the mortality from this cause. A most dangerous fever locally called cham\u00e9ri (typhus) breaks out in\nthe upper valleys and causes great havoc. A dreadful epidemic of this broke out in Sar\u00e1j in 1894 and caused great mortality. Venereal disease of all kinds is very prevalent in Gum\u00e1, Choh\u00e1r and Sar\u00e1j where dirty habits of living contribute to aggravate the disease. Leprosy prevails in the villages of Choh\u00e1r and Darangs\u00edr\u00e1 where the people live on inferior kinds of grain. The pleasantest times of the year are a little before or after the rains, from March to May and from October to December. The atmosphere is then very bracing and invigorating, and those subject to malarial affection and other diseases, in which a mountain climate is indicated, are highly benefited by going up in this season.\n\nIt is natural that in a remote and primitive community such as Mandi the people should retain their ancient customs and superstitions to a degree unknown in the Punjab plains, where contact with other creeds and more progressive races have obliterated many of the ceremonies of the ancient faith. Probably therefore the customs of the Mandi people at the present day differ but slightly from the universal practices observed by Hind\u00fas all over India in former days. It is for this reason that a somewhat detailed account of them has been thought worthy of inclusion in this Chapter. The customs noted here are principally those of the four highest castes, the Br\u00e1hmans, Khatr\u00ed, R\u00e1jp\u00fats and Mah\u00e1jans.\n\nTo begin with birth customs; the athwain ceremony takes place at the beginning of the eighth month of pregnancy. An auspicious day is selected by a Br\u00e1hman who accompanies the woman to a stream. There she bathes under the shadow of a tree in full bearing. Her parents send her a new dress and other relations send presents of rice, fruits, etc. A goat is killed and relations invited to the feast. The Br\u00e1hman does p\u00faja in honour of the nine gods (naugrah) and gets the clothes of the woman and some eight annas as his fee. When the child is born it is weighed against corn, and the corn goes to the midwife. The clothes of the mother are also the midwife's perquisite if the child is a boy, and her fee in that event varies from one to ten rupees. If, however, the child is a girl the midwife only gets one rupee at the outside and hardly any clothes. Among Khatris when the first child is born, the midwife goes to congratulate the mother's parents, taking some blades of grass (drubh) in her hand. They reward her with a new dress. The baby's father is similarly congratulated by his father-in-law's servants, and rewards them. The date of the purification ceremony (gontr\u00edala) varies in the different castes. Among Br\u00e1hmans it is the 11th day after confinement; among R\u00e1jp\u00fats and Kan\u00e9ts the 13th; among Bohras the 16th and among Suds the 30th. The house is white-washed, prayers are offered to the Sun, Moon, and the nine gods, and also to a jarfull of water, called kalas. A small earthenware dome is made and offered to the goddess Biha. Every man present gets a panchgayab (or panchamrit) to drink; a mixture of milk, butter, ghi, honey, and cow's urine. The midwife is again\npresented with money, from one to five rupees, while the officiating Brahman gets from two annas to a rupee. A boy's horoscope is cast on this same day and he is generally given a name, suggested by the constellation under which he was born. The child is dressed on the gontriala day in new clothes sent him by his sister, uncle or aunt. If he wears for a year clothes given to him by relations or friends his chances of long life will be greater.\n\nThere is no ceremony connected with the cutting of the teeth. If, however, a child cuts his upper teeth first it is a bad omen for his uncle, who must, if he wishes to avert ill fortune, present the child with clothes dyed blue.\n\nA child is weaned in the sixth month, and various articles are put before him\u2014a piece of cloth, a sword, a pen, a book, and some money. Whichever he first touches indicates his future profession.\n\nThe ceremony of taking the child outside the house for the first time is performed on a lucky day during the sixth month after his birth; charms are tied on to his limbs to frighten away devils, and a piece of gold or silver carved into the image of the Sun, the Moon or Mars, is hung round his neck to save him from the sinister influences exercised by the divinities.\n\nIf a woman constantly loses her children a devil-dancer is called in. The Br\u00e1hman fixes on a lucky day, and the devil-dancer takes the woman out to bathe in some sacred river. There prayers are offered and a goat sacrificed. If this plan fails, the failure is ascribed to fate. Another device is to discover by the aid of the Br\u00e1hman whose is the evil influence that destroys the children, and propitiate him with offerings, the Br\u00e1hman giving the woman a piece of his magical thread to tie round her neck and waist. If a child survives after this rite has been performed, his nose is bored and he is generally given a low-caste name, such as Domna, Chamaru, or Hijaru, to propitiate still further the angry deity.\n\nA child is shaved at the age of 3, 5 or 7. Kanets perform the ceremony at the shrine of their family deity: Br\u00e1hmans, R\u00e1jputs, and Bohras, at home. The hair tied with a couple of pice in a piece of red cloth is deposited by Kanets at the feet of the god, a goat is sacrificed and a Br\u00e1hman given a rupee. Among the other castes the maternal grandfather sends clothes for the child and his mother.\n\nAlthough only the four superior castes are bound to wear the janeo, but others, such as Kanets, goldsmiths and barbers, wear it when visiting some sacred place, or when they are married. To make the janeo cotton is specially separated by hand from the seeds and woven into thread by the wearer's mother, an unmarried girl, or some old woman of high caste. Three threads make a lari, three laris make an agar, and two agars make a janeo. For a Br\u00e1hman the janeo should be 96 times the double width of the four fingers; other castes do not make it so long. As a rule three knots are tied\nin the janeo but the number varies with the different parvars whose protection the wearers claim. When a boy assumes the janeo, puja is offered to Ganesh; sacrifices are performed in three different places and the boy bathes (punahi).\n\nThe priest clasps the boy's hands and bids him ask the company for alms. The boy's relations then ask the priest to unfasten the string tied round the boy's wrists. The priest is thenceforward the boy's spiritual adviser.\n\nA janeo composed of two agars is worn in making offerings to the dead, to deities or seers. For the dead it is worn from the right shoulder across the left, for deities from the left shoulder across the right side, while for seers it is worn like a necklace.\n\nFor calls of nature the janeo is put over the right ear. Wearers of the janeo are bound to observe the following rules of life:\n\n1. Get up early in the morning, answer the call of nature, wash the hands with mud and clean the teeth.\n\n2. Bathe, say prayers, offer libations of water to dead ancestors, and repeat the Gayatri quietly. Three prayers must be said daily; morning, noon and evening. One whose parents are alive has not to offer any libations.\n\nThese rules apply to Br\u00e1hmans, Khatris and R\u00e1jp\u00fats only.\n\nOn the last day of S\u00e1wan, the Br\u00e1hmans gather together and go to river or stream where they bathe and purify the janeo. It is only changed when broken or after mourning.\n\nIf a janeo thus purified is obtainable for a boy who is assuming it for the first time so much the better, otherwise one is purified by a Br\u00e1hman. When the janeo is broken, the wearer does not speak or eat anything until he has changed it. The Br\u00e1hmans, R\u00e1jp\u00fats, and Khatris take to it between eight and eleven years of age; Bohras wear it when they are married; and Kanets on occasion of ceremony. Bohras and Kanets are supposed to use janeo of 92 \"chap,\" but some take a longer or a shorter one. A Br\u00e1hman who has not got the janeo before he is eleven is considered a Sudra and is not compelled to perform any particular ceremonies. No penalty attaches to the omission. Any hungry man who happens to come by when the ceremony is proceeding is fed, some money is distributed among the Br\u00e1hmans, and clothes are given to daughters, sisters, their husbands and other chief relations. If the wearer is unable for any reason to go to a temple, his hair tied in a red piece of cloth, with some money and rice, are sent there for the god. A man without a janeo is looked upon as a Sudra. He is not allowed to say sandhiy\u00e1j (prayers) and provokes unfavourable comment if he does so.\nThe number of males in every 10,000 of both sexes is shown below.\n\n| Sex | Table 16 of Part B | Census of | In villages | In Towns | Total |\n|-----|-------------------|-----------|-------------|----------|-------|\n|     |                   |           |             |          |       |\n| All religions | 1881 | ... | ... | 5,136 | 5,282 | 5,141 |\n|           | 1891 | ... | ... | 5,148 | 5,744 | 5,173 |\n|           | 1901 | ... | ... | 5,182 | 6,051 | 5,233 |\n| Hindus | Census of 1901 | ... | ... | 5,173 | 6,072 | 5,212 |\n| Buddhists | ... | ... | ... | 5,961 | ... | 5,961 |\n| Muhammadans | ... | ... | ... | 5,593 | 5,770 | 5,626 |\n\nOut of the population of 174,045\u2014males 90,896 and females 83,149\u2014the proportion of males to females is as 100 to 91.\n\nThe marginal table shows the number of females to every 1,000 males of five years of age as returned in the Census of 1901.\n\nIt will be seen that the proportion of girl children to boys is as satisfactory as possible.\n\nChildren under 12 number altogether 50,815, the proportion of children to adults being as 41 is to 100. Of the adults 65,025 are males and 58,205 females. The proportion of male adults to females is therefore about 100 to 89 as compared with 100 males to 91 females in the total population. But among children under 12 we find as many as 58,871 boys to 54,944 girls or 100 boys to 96 girls.\n\nThroughout the whole State early marriage is customary among the higher classes of Hind\u00fas, the only exceptions being in the case of very high-caste R\u00e1jput girls for whom it is difficult to find a suitable match. Among Br\u00e1hmans and Khatris, betrothals are generally dharm or pun, no exchange or payment of any kind being made. A high-caste R\u00e1jput finds it difficult to marry his daughter to a R\u00e1jput of higher birth without payment of money, and a valuable dowry, and hence there are many R\u00e1jp\u00fats, who owing to poverty have daughters of the age of 14 or upwards still unmarried. On the other hand, a R\u00e1jput of high birth is often bribed by the payment of money to marry his daughter to a R\u00e1jput of lower status. The Khatris of Mandiseldom marry their daughters outside the town, although they themselves marry girls from elsewhere in case of necessity.\n\nIn both these castes betrothal takes place between the ages of 3 and 5, and marriage between 8 and 11. Although early betrothals are common among Kanets marriage does not take place until the\nparties have attained the age of puberty. In the higher hills, it is customary to marry young women, generally between 11 and 15 years of age.\n\nWidow re-marriage is strictly prohibited among the higher classes of Br\u0101hmans, R\u0101jp\u016bts, Khatris and Bohras, but it is common among the Kanets and the lower classes of Hind\u016bs. There is a proverb in the higher hills that a woman is never a widow, for women being of great assistance in agriculture a land-holder on becoming a widower has every inducement to re-marry as he needs a wife to till his land. A Kanet woman or widow of lower caste inheriting her late husband's land is not dispossessed of it even if she takes a consort to live with her, so long as she does not leave her deceased husband's house. In such a case the man is called linda or konsal, and his son gahhru or riondha. If a widow has land she can easily find a home with a protector because of her use as a worker in the fields.\n\nThe different tribes marry as a rule among themselves but cannot marry persons of the same clan or al. With reference to the g\u00f4t there seems less strictness, though among all the lower classes it is strictly forbidden to intermarry with members of the same g\u00f4t.\n\nThere are four kinds of betrothal among the lower classes:\n\n1. Exchange (batta satta), in which the bride's father receives no money for his daughter, but in exchange gets a wife from the relatives of the bridegroom for some one nearly connected with him. Such marriages always result in quarrels and disputes, because the wife thus married will not remain in her husband's family unless the wife promised in exchange has been supplied.\n\n2. Labour (ghari jovatri), in which the bridegroom is bound to work in the bride's family for a time mutually agreed upon, sometimes for nine or ten years. This custom is a very old one but is now decaying.\n\n3. Money, in which the bride's father receives a certain sum of money from the bridegroom for the hand of his daughter. The poorer agriculturists often have to borrow to satisfy the wife's father, and sometimes get so deeply into debt that it takes years to pay it off, and many poor peasants remain unmarried.\n\n4. Dharm or pun, where nothing is received in cash or exchange for the girl by her relatives. This sort of marriage is very rare among the lower classes.\n\nWeddings are celebrated in three different ways:\n\n1. Bishor; or marriage according to the laws of the Sh\u0101stras. The bridegroom wears a crown when he goes to his bride's house and the procession is accompanied by music.\n\n(1) Riondha means son of a riondha; and Linda means one who has no home.\n(2) Beokari, in which the Sh\u00e1stras are not followed nor astrologers consulted, but the wedding is performed in the simplest way. A corner of the husband's plaid is tied in a knot to the bride's dopatta and both garments knotted together are carried round the altar on which the worship of Ganpatri is celebrated. This kind of marriage is common in Sar\u00e1j and N\u00e1chan. The bridegroom followed by his bride makes four rounds round a vessel filled with liquor or sur and the marriage is thus performed.\n\n(3). The third is a very simple form. The bridegroom goes to the bride's house on a specified day and takes his betrothed away with him, no music or procession accompanying him. On the arrival of the bride in the bridegroom's house a goat is sacrificed in the name of the local deity. This form is common in the Choh\u00e1r and N\u00e1chan Districts.\n\nThere is a fourth kind of marriage which is curious. A wife is bought by a family quietly and without ceremony. When a child has been born to her, the husband and wife worship Ganesh, and receiving the newly-born child into their arms celebrate the marriage.\n\nWhen a marriage is not performed on a fixed day or a quarrel breaks out postponing the marriage, the bridegroom seeks an opportunity and carries off his betrothed by force and the marriage is performed round a fire made in the jungle with wild ber wood. The marriage thus performed holds good.\n\nThey sometimes pay no attention to the movement of the stars and marriages thus performed are held on the following days in the year:\n\n(1) The Shibr\u00e1tri day in February.\n(2) The Gur Teriya on the 13th Lunar day of M\u00e1gh.\n(3) The L\u00e1hul day on the 2nd of Bais\u00e1kh. These are called Bhat marriages, and are performed in case of emergency.\n\nAmong the agricultural classes the bride generally receives a new blanket (pattu) for her head-dress from her parents, and a string of black wool knitted together, called jutti, which is intertwined with the hair. At the time of the bride's departure a knife for cutting grass and rope are given her by her parents. The mukhl\u00e1wa ceremony is not separately performed. During the marriage days one night is fixed for the ceremony called soh\u00e1g-r\u00e1t. If the married couple are of mature age they live together from that date. If not, they have to wait until they have attained majority.\n\nThe marriage customs are unfavourable to a great increase of population, as among the hill people the marriage tie is a very loose\nPolygamy is common and polyandry also not unknown. A woman is, for a few rupees, passed on from one to another, and the result is that when offended with their husbands women often go away to Kulu or Kangra. In the same way many women of those parts leave their husbands and find homes in Mandi.\n\nPolygamy is more common than would appear from the Census returns of 1901, which shows 1,067 married women for every 1,000 married men, excluding widows and widowers. It appears from the returns of this Census that there are 1,288 Hindus and 23 Muhammadans who have more than one wife.\n\nRajputs, Brahmins, Khatris, Bohras and Kanets are below the average, while Hindu and Muhammadan Gujars are above it. The figures show that 7 per cent. of the married males of this class have more than one wife; next come the Nais, then the Lohars and Kumhars.\n\nPolyandry is still usual in Saraj where a woman brought into a family is the joint wife of all the brothers of the husband living together.\n\nIt is a belief generally prevalent among the agricultural classes that a woman brought by marriage into a family becomes the property of that family, and on her husband's death she is claimed by right of inheritance as his wife by any surviving brother of the deceased.\n\nThe term jhanjarar has a slightly different signification in Mandi and in Kangra.\n\nIn Mandi the marriage of an elder brother's widow is practised among all castes though among the four highest it entails excommunication. It is called dharewa karewa and never jhanjarar, which is only used in cases in which the woman is married to a man who is not her first husband's brother. Such cases are of frequent occurrence, as besides the ordinary chances of widowhood a woman may be divorced or sold by her original husband, and frequently leaves him of her own accord.\n\nThe marriage of a younger brother's widow is only allowable among the lowest castes.\n\nWhen a woman marries her husband's younger brother, and has children by her second husband, a part of her first husband's property will go to them, though the greater part is divided among his own children. A widow is entitled to possession of her late husband's property during widowhood on condition of chastity.\n\nThe four highest castes divorce their wives for misconduct only, other castes divorce them at will.\n\nLanguage.\n\nThe language of Saraj is mostly unintelligible to the people of the lower villages, but there is a lingua franca styled Pahari which is generally understood by all. It is more akin to Hindustani than...\nPunj\u00e1bi although all the pronouns of Punj\u00e1bi are in common use. The written character is T\u00e1nkri which is nothing more than a modification of Hind\u00ed. The Persian character is not generally popular, and one who uses it is nicknamed pheti qalam w\u00e1l\u00e1, or one who writes the wrong way, i.e., from right to left. The people are prejudiced against the learning of foreign languages, there being a common idea that children become disrespectful after such an education. The result is that few men send their sons to school and education is very backward. Although a primary school has existed since 1872, no progress has been made, only two persons, one a Br\u00e1hman, the other a Khatri, have passed the Entrance Examination of the Punjab University. Both are in the service of the State. In 1903 the school was raised to the standard of a Middle School and, some trained teachers having been engaged, a greater desire is now shown for education.\n\nTRIBES AND CASTES.\n\nThe whole population, with trifling exceptions, is Hindu, and the most important caste numerically and otherwise is that of the Kanets. They number (1901) 82,323 out of a total population of 174,045. Br\u00e1hmans come next with 18,710. The chief trading caste, the Khatris, number only 3,219 and many of them own land. Of the menial castes the cham\u00e1rs number 10,530 and the d\u00e1m\u00e1rs 14,184.\n\nTurning to the Muhammadans we find a colony of the ubiquitous Path\u00e1ns even in remote Mandi. Though they number 614, they are the largest Muhammadan body in Mandi except the G\u00fajars (745).\n\nThe more numerous bodies among the Hind\u00fas are discussed in greater detail below.\n\nThere are three groups of Br\u00e1hmans. The Parohit, Pandit, Tunait, Upadhay\u00e1, Lagw\u00e1l and Dichhat form the first class. The Aushdhi, Chhajwan, Ror, Si\u00e1t, Khal\u00e1t and 20 others come within the second circle. These two groups avoid agriculture and do not cultivate land themselves.\n\nThe Halb\u00e1i or agricultural Br\u00e1hmans form the third group. The chief of them are the Bat\u00e1hnu, Sur\u00e1hnu, Katw\u00e1r, Jamnoni, Harli\u00e1n\u00ed, Batehru, Ladw\u00e1l, Pandit, Khalroia, Nade, Chin\u00e1hl\u00fa, Barw\u00e1l, Asl\u00e1, Up\u00e1de.\n\nBr\u00e1hmans of the first group are religious guides, astrologers, ministrants in temples or family priests, and as such are respected by all classes. They intermarry as a rule among themselves, but sometimes accept wives from the group next below them, but never give daughters in marriage to those that rank low in the circle. These are the following:\u2014Riwaru, Marthw\u00e1l, Malhw\u00e1r, Dorm\u00e1r, Madhogar, Kamh Padhi, Parsw\u00e1l, Bhater\u00e1, D\u00e1ri-ki-padhi,\n\n(1) That is, each group intermarries only in itself, not with other groups.\nKas-ke-padhi, Chheri, Tharr, Sat Sao, Darangw\u00e1l, Gumw\u00e1l, Kat Bh\u00e1t, J\u00e1n, Amon Phor, Dhapon\u00e1.\n\nThe reigning family is Mandial R\u00e1jp\u00fat and the relations of the R\u00e9ja are called Mi\u00e1ns. The Heir-Apparent is called Tik\u00e1, the next heir is called Doth\u00e1in, the next Tirth\u00e1i, the next Choth\u00e1i, and so on.\n\nThe R\u00e1jp\u00fats of the first order are the following:\u2014Mandial, Katoch, Goleria, Sonkhl\u00e1, H\u00e1thi\u00e1l, Pathhania, Jamwalia, Jaswalia, Bhang\u00e1l\u00e1, Sibaya, Drol, Saroch. The Katoch, Goleria, Jaswal, Sibaya and Saroch have a common g\u00f3t, being descended from one and the same progenitor.\n\nJai Deva or \u2018Hail to the King\u2019 is the common salutation among R\u00e1jp\u00fats of the first class. They receive this salutation from R\u00e1jp\u00fats of a lower class, but do not return it to an inferior, and they reply to R\u00e1jp\u00fats of the inferior classes by the word jai only. In order to maintain the dignity and prestige of their rank, they must never drive a plough, never give their daughters in marriage to those inferior to them, although they may receive wives from the class next to them, and the females of their households must observe strict seclusion. R\u00e1jp\u00fats of the same al or clan do not intermarry although they sometimes disregard the prohibition against marriage within the g\u00f3t. They marry freely in the mother\u2019s clan, and sometimes also marry in their own g\u00f3t. Widow re-marriage is strictly prohibited among all the classes.\n\nThe following are the Halb\u00e1\u00ed or cultivating tribes or als of the R\u00e1jp\u00fats:\u2014Dhay\u00e1na, Pingliy\u00e1na, Patiyal, Mahle, Jamsual, Khaw\u00e1s, Mhotlu, Dharw\u00e1l, R\u00e1wat, N\u00e1y\u00e1l, Ranat, Katoghni. They give their daughters in marriage to the higher classes, but never receive wives from them. They are supposed to be an inferior class. Instances are found in which a wealthy R\u00e1jp\u00fat of a high class marries a daughter of the lower class, but his sons are married in the high class.\n\nThe Khatr\u00ed\u00eds of Mandi have distinction of tribe. All are socially equal.\n\nThe following are the tribes of the Khatr\u00ed\u00eds:\u2014Lamkiyar, K\u00e1yath, K\u00e1yath Kalru, Darangw\u00e1l, Baid, Bis\u00e1y\u00fa Ror, Saigal, Kami\u00e1na, Hatwali, Pah\u00e1r\u00fa, Kehuria, Jokhaya, Dhon Bhang\u00e1l\u00edya, Bhang\u00e1l\u00fa, Mher\u00fa, H\u00e1d, Pujale and Nery\u00e1l. They intermarry among themselves, but do not marry in the same al or clan. They cannot get a wife from any other caste whether it be a higher or lower one, because the issue of such a connection would be illegitimate or sirtor\u00e1.\n\nThe Khatr\u00ed\u00eds of Mandi are not of pure descent, but from a mixed caste. K\u00e1yasthas of Hindust\u00e1n and Khatr\u00ed\u00eds of the Punjab have become intermixed and there are some K\u00e1yath Khatr\u00ed\u00eds who trace their origin from the Bhatn\u00e1g\u00e1r K\u00e1yaths to Lucknow and Ayodhia (Oudh).\nThey are generally Hindi-writing clerks in the service of the State and take a pride in keeping up their profession of permanship; worshipping a pen and inkstand on the Deshra day.\n\nThe Bohras of Mandi are the same as the Mah\u00e1jans of K\u00e1ngra: they belong to the Vaisya caste of the Pur\u00e1nic period. The chief of them are:\u2014Ghandoar or Baid, Dharkaur, Toppor, Gagot\u00ed, Kaule Chane, Gatehe, Mahti Chaggghlar, Dharwar, Chettal, K\u00e1yath, Suketru, Katochu, Jabbh\u00e1th\u00fa, Chowdhr\u00ed, Kochru, Dogre, Chhotu and Baidu. They are mostly of the Mangal g\u00f3t. They intermarry among themselves without distinction, although they do not marry in their own clan. They intermarry with the Mah\u00e1jans of K\u00e1ngra, and the Bohras of Suket and Bil\u00e1sipur State. Some of them do not marry in the mother's g\u00f3t for five generations.\n\nThey take money for the marriage of daughters and also effect marriages by exchange or batta satta, but they never permit widow marriage, nor is an illegitimate son, or sirto\u00edd, married to a Bohra girl of pure blood. They wear a janeo of 96 threads, and are generally shop-keepers, traders, bankers and clerks. They are a very quiet race and not influential members of society in Mandi, although the Bohras of Suket once held some very important and influential posts, and had a high position in society.\n\nKanets claim to be R\u00e1jp\u00fats of impure blood. There is very little doubt that formerly they were Th\u00e1kur R\u00e1jp\u00fats. They debased themselves by adopting the custom of dhaereva or kareva, i.e., widow re-marriage, and were so called because they gave up the ancient kanet or custom of their religion, adopting a practice reprobated by the Sh\u00e1stras. They form 47 per cent. of the population. The Kanets of the lower valley are Rupurnw\u00e1l, Soklani, Lawai, Binyohe, Kamarth\u00fa, Landhi, Balyani, Glasni, Bandhi, Bar\u00e1ri Bharene, Lakhatri, Mandhatri, Garle, Kalthre, Sadhiane, Bar\u00e1ri, Pisach, Gumre, Bharin, Bharg\u00e1in, Nalyan\u00ed, Garohe, Badw\u00e1l, Naghw\u00e1l, Seohe. They wear a janeo and intermarry among themselves. When a man dies young his widow is taken to wife by any of his male relations. This sort of widow re-marriage is called jhan\u00edhr\u00e1r\u00e1, and in the absence of such a relation she can of her own free will marry any other man of her own tribe, and her issue are entitled to inherit their father's property. Some Kanets are addicted to drinking, others not, but it does not make any difference in their social rank. A rich land-holder may marry as many wives as he thinks he requires to cultivate his fields. Polyandry is also practised in Sar\u00e1j and Choh\u00e1r. The Kanets of these waziris and of the Kulu border do not wear a janeo nor do they perform marriage and death ceremonies according to the Hindu Sh\u00e1stras, and so they are supposed to be descendants of the aboriginal race of the hills. However, some Kanets of Sanor, Bad\u00e1r and Uttarsal are R\u00e1jp\u00fats of an inferior class. They are called Th\u00e1kurs and give their daughters in marriage to the R\u00e1ja or his relatives. Girls so given are called khaw\u00e1ris or concubines. Their customs maintain\nthe purity of the Hindu religion: they never drink and are extremely temperate and frugal in their habits. Their manners are simple and quiet, they are devoted to agriculture and are honest, industrious and loyal. They marry girls of the inferior tribes of R\u00e1hu and Khas, but do not give their girls in marriage to these classes. Some of them also wear a janeo.\n\nThe R\u00e1hu and Khas are two important tribes of the hill Kanets. They intermarry as a rule among themselves but sometimes marry girls of other tribes, such as Jats, Kumh\u00e1rs, N\u00e1is and Ghirths, and even give them their daughters in marriage. A widow is claimed as the property of her husband's family. Among the Khas tribe, (i) they get purified on the 13th day after the death of a relation, but among the R\u00e1hu tribe this is done on the 9th day, (ii) the Khas wears the janeo or sacred thread, which the R\u00e1hu does not. They are exclusively agriculturists and are industrious cultivators.\n\nThere is a very limited number of Ghirths, Jats and Jh\u00ednwars in Mandi and they seem to have immigrated into the State from the Kangra Tahsil.\n\nLoh\u00e1rs and Tarkh\u00e1ns make no distinction between themselves and each other socially. They are one and the same caste. Difference of profession does not effect any change. They intermarry among themselves. They have g\u00f4ts but no als. They do not marry in the same g\u00f4t. A man gets excommunicated from caste by marrying a woman of a different tribe or clan, and a younger brother's widow is never taken to wife, although an elder brother's widow is so taken by the jhanjhr\u00e1v\u00e1 rite. Some of them also wear a janeo. Their principal tribes are the Thathhiar, Birdi and Kondal.\n\nThere are different tribes of N\u00e1is\u2014Chandel, Khakri, Guhrya and Jamwal. They have no g\u00f4ts but regard the al. They do not intermarry in the same al, but intermarry among themselves, jhanjhr\u00e1v\u00e1 marriage is not practised, they do not take the widow of a deceased brother to wife, and a Kanet girl is accepted as a legal wife. Their chief profession is that of barber. They are also engaged as keepers of clothes but are chiefly employed for the performance of birth, marriage and death rites.\n\nTheir tribes are:\u2014Slah\u00e9, Ganjhe, Chaplaiy\u00e1, Brahim Bazarya, and Anot. They do not intermarry within their own g\u00f4t. Ganpati worship is performed at the house of the bride's father and the marriage is then celebrated.\n\nThe Gujars in these hills are exclusively a pastoral tribe, and they scarcely cultivate at all. They keep herds of buffaloes and live on the sale of the milk, gh\u00ed and butter. There are some Hindu Gujars in Mandi. They are of the following tribes:\u2014Khat\u00fana, Choh\u00e1n, Gurs\u00ed, Didhar, Bhumbhale, Katarya, Parswal, Malheria, Kol\u00ed, Kantiya, Motle Chaichi, Bhunch, Bargat, Kal\u00e1s, Chhore, L\u00e1di, Ch\u00e1i, Baj\u00e1r and Badh\u00e1na. They intermarry among themselves, and\nmarry a girl when she attains the age of puberty. Betrothal is settled by drinking liquor at the house of the bride's father. They may marry a Loh\u00e1r or a N\u00e1i girl, their inferior in rank, but they do not give daughters to an inferior caste. The widow of a deceased brother is claimed by the remaining ones. Widow re-marriage is also practised, the *jhanjh\u00e1r\u00e1* being performed.\n\nThe higher and lower classes are distinguished by the names *bhitarke* (in-door) and *baharke* (out-door). The latter term includes D\u00e1g\u00eds, D\u00famn\u00e1s, Cham\u00e1rs, Ch\u00edn\u00e1ls, Loh\u00e1rs and Kol\u00eds.\n\nThe D\u00famn\u00e1s have various *g\u00f4ts*. When they work in bamboo they are called Bhanjras. They make sieves, fans, matting, baskets, screens. They also follow the profession of Darzi, Loh\u00e1r, or Chhima. They do not marry in the same *g\u00f4t*, and generally marry a girl under 16 years of age. Darains are professional swimmers, who use *dar\u00e1\u00eds* or inflated buffalo skins in ferrying passengers across a river. They form a distinct caste.\n\nThey have no tribes nor clans. By marrying a girl from a D\u00famn\u00e1 or Ch\u00fahr\u00e1 clan a Cham\u00e1r is excommunicated from the caste. They are workers in leather.\n\nThey claim their origin from the Kanets. The offspring of a Kanet by a woman of low caste is called a Kol\u00ed. They perform menial services for Kanet land-holders at festivities and are also agriculturists, but are all notoriously lazy.\n\nThey form a branch of the Kol\u00eds, and in rank are inferior to them. Their profession is different. They extract oil and carry loads on ponies. Their tribes are:\u2014Lakkar, Choh\u00e1n, Takrial, Siy\u00e1hi, Mhotlu, Dhortung and Kathw\u00e1r\u00fa.\n\nThe Ch\u00fahr\u00e1s of Mandi are of two classes, claiming descent from R\u00e1jp\u00fats and Brahmans respectively. The former comprise three *g\u00f4ts*: Gh\u00fasar, Choh\u00e1n and Rathw\u00e1l; and the latter also three: Kaly\u00e1ne, Bains and Gaur.\n\nThe Ch\u00fahr\u00e1s of the Gaur *g\u00f4t* burn their dead and perform the *kirya* and *sr\u00e1dh* ceremonies. All other Ch\u00fahr\u00e1s bury their dead. They marry among themselves, and recognise the re-marriage of widows. The Ch\u00fahr\u00e1s have their own priests, called Ch\u00fahr\u00e1 Br\u00e1hmans, who eat and drink with them.\n\nThe Mir\u00e1s\u00eds of Mandi belong to Mokhar *g\u00f4t* and claim to be the hereditary bards of the R\u00e1jp\u00fats. Dhadis are of the Tan\u00far caste and the Jind *g\u00f4t*. Excepting these no other caste of either tribe is to be found in Mandi. The Mir\u00e1s\u00eds play on the *dholak* and *sitar* and Dhadis on the *dhadh* and they recite the deeds of the ancient heroes at the R\u00e1ja's table. Mir\u00e1s\u00ed women dance and sing before the women-folk of their *jajmans* (clients) but Dhadhi women do not. Mir\u00e1s\u00eds and Dhadis intermarry with one another. At a wedding, birthday or other festival they visit their *jajman's* house and receive their *l\u00e1g* (dues). Dhadis generally receive only half as much as the\nMandi State.] Descriptive. [Part A.\n\nMir\u00e1sis. They have no panchayats of their own although their chief receives the title of Rana from the State. He gets some additional dues and acts as a herald for which he is paid. The Karhali Mir\u00e1sis are considered of lower rank and the Mir\u00e1sis of the Moghar g\u00f4t and the Dhadhis do not marry with them.\n\nThey play on the tabla and sarangi and their women sing with them. They also beg when paying a visit to any house to which they have been summoned.\n\nThe Mirasis of Mandi only marry with the R\u00e1jp\u00fat Mirasis of the neighbouring States.\n\nThey are Muhammadans observing the rules of Islam though they are also believers in Devi Bhaw\u00e1n\u00ed, and the following is a hymn which they generally sing in praise of Devi B\u00e1kb\u00e1ni.\n\n\"Maiy\u00e1 ridh de, silh de, asht nau ridh de bans ki birdh de B\u00e1k B\u00e1ni.\n\nMaiya gy\u00e1n de dhi\u00e1n de, Sarb Sukhm\u00e1n de, abhai bardan de, B\u00e1k B\u00e1ni.\n\nMaiy\u00e1 dugh ko d\u00fbr kar Sukh bhurpur kar khalq k\u00ed \u00e1s p\u00faran kar\u00e1mi.\n\nSri j\u00e1gti jot Sri jagti jot t\u00fa Ambk\u00e1 R\u00e1ni.\"\n\n\"O Mother B\u00e1kb\u00e1ni, (goddess of eloquence) give us wealth and power, also the coveted nine virtues and increase of our race. O Mother B\u00e1kb\u00e1ni give us knowledge and meditation on God, give us all happiness and grants us the boon of fearlessness. O Mother remove all afflictions and give all comforts. Thou art powerful to fulfil desires of the world and thou art a brilliant light and all brightness O Ambk\u00e1 R\u00e1ni.\"\n\nThe entire population is agricultural, and as a rule every man, no matter what his caste is, has his holding which he either cultivates himself, paying the revenue to the State, or gets cultivated by others. Women perform all kinds of agricultural labour, except ploughing, and much of the field work is done by them.\n\nThe following are the recognized divisions of time. Day-break they call bhiy\u00e1g and sunrise tark\u00e1, noon is called dopahar, afternoon is dopahar dhale and sunset s\u00e1n\u00ed. When the night begins to get dark they call it tirk\u00e1l\u00e1n; 11 midnight is adh\u00ed r\u00e1t. In the higher hills of Sar\u00e1j, Sanor, etc., they call day-break jhabd\u00e1lyu (1), morning k\u00e1liol (2), noon, dopahar, and evening dhalka (3). The close of the day or sunset is dhira udeo or sanpari. About three hours after sunset is liyali (4), 6 hours after sunset bethi biyali, midnight adhi rachh, and three hours before day-break r\u00e1ch biyai.\n\n(1). Lit. 'breaking of light,' or day-break. (2). Fr. katwari 'breakfast.' (3). 'Passing,' hence 'passing day' or evening. (4) Biyal, means 'meal,' or evening meal time.\nThe agricultural classes before going to the fields eat bread, made of barley, maize, or course millet (mandal), with some vegetables cooked in chhach. This morning meal is called kalwar. The dopahri is eaten as mid-day, and consists of rice or cakes made of maize or millet. In the evening they have a supper which is called bidli, at which rice is seldom used. The people of Saraj are fond of cakes made of wheat and poppy seeds, which are boiled in water and with which they mix ghi and salt. All the higher classes undress and put on a dhoti when they take rice and dal. On festive occasions goats are slaughtered and several kinds of dishes prepared. The residents of Mandi town get up before sunrise, rub oil on their bodies and then take a very hot bath. Widows as a rule bathe daily but married women only occasionally. Meat is eaten by men and women of all classes, but widows abstain from it. All eat jhatka or the flesh of animals beheaded according to the Hindu rite, halal or the flesh of animals slaughtered according to the Muhammadan rite, being strictly prohibited. Men, not women, cook rice. The people are very fond of drinking jhol, which is prepared by boiling chach or butter milk with salt, ghi and spices at each meal. They generally abstain from the use of onions, turnips and carrots. They are not very fond of sweetmeats but eat sour pickles. All the lower classes are great consumers of liquor. The people of Ballh are much given to drinking. There the cultivating classes are ruined by the excessive use of liquor and affrays are of frequent occurrence. The hill men of Saraj and Sanor are more temperate.\n\nThe favourite drinks of the hillmen at fairs are lugri and sur. The former is prepared from rice, fermented with phap, a kind of yeast imported from Ladakh, and Lahulis manufacture this drink at fairs for sale. Sur is made of kodra (millet) fermented with dheli, a mixture of herbs, made into a cake and dried for some days, when it begins to smell and is ready for use.\n\nThe jhaggi, a long woollen garment reaching to the knees, is generally used by women, and they also wear trousers of the same material, tying a gachi or rope, also of wool, round their waists. They wear caps made by themselves and ornamented with flowers, and shoes which they make of grass for themselves. At fairs and large gatherings they wear waistcoats (kurta) and blankets from head to foot. Women of the better classes generally wear gold rings in the nose, silver rings in their ears, bangles of brass or zinc on their wrists, a silver necklace, a silver collar, of three or four strings round the neck, and brass anklets, weighing as much as a ser, on their feet. Among the higher classes in the town of Mandi, the women ordinarily wear a petticoat (ghaghra) which covers the breast, and long trousers (souhan), with a dopatta or mantle of various gay colours thrown over the head and body. Widows, however, use white dopattas instead of coloured ones. At marriages and other festivals instead of ghaghras they wear a pishwaaz or cloth gown of various\nbright colours, often made of very fine muslin, covering the breast and head with a waistcoat and dopatta. They put surma or antimony in the eyes, and a bindi or thin piece of gold or silver on the forehead. The ordinary dress of a man consist of a smock reaching to the waist, a chil or anga a long garment reaching to the knees, and breaches. A peasant wears a pattu or blanket as well. Hill-men wear caps, and men of the lower hills safas of various colours.\n\nKhatri, Bohras and Brahmins wear small pagri of a bright colour, while Rajputs of the ruling family wrap a sifa round the pagri, letting one corner of it hang down to serve as a hood to protect the ears from the cold after the fashion of the Sikh Sardar of the court of Lahore.\n\nThe grdon or village of Mandi, like the Tika of Kangra, bears very little resemblance to a village in the plains and the dwellings of the hill people are scattered, each family living upon its own holding at a distance from other families. In the higher hills there are a few patches of cultivation made by breaking up land, and dwelling sites are selected on a spot safe from the wind and commanding a view of the fields. The houses are generally grouped without any method or plan, their arrangement depending on the nature of the ground on which they stand. In the higher hills they are generally built with two storeys, corners of the land being utilized as cattle sheds. In Saraj however some houses are three or four storeys high. For timber the cultivators can generally get ban, chil, rai and tos trees from the forests free of charge. Houses are as a rule made of sun-dried bricks with thatched roofs, only 20 per cent. being roofed with slates. Cattle are kept in the gawai or lower storey, and there is a thambi or granary, and a bhar or store of grass. The rooms in the upper storey are called bahur; on one side is the sleeping-room, and on the other the kitchen. In the verandah adjoining these rooms fire is kept ready for use. A ladder leads from the verandah to the lower storey. The accommodation in the upper floor is extended by a wooden balcony on one or more sides. This is boarded in and rests on beams in the walls. It serves as a play-room for the children. The people themselves saw the timber for building but require the assistance of a Thhavvi or mason in constructing the walls. They plaster and whitewash their houses once a year, on the Sayar day in September. The houses are scantily furnished. In the old days they had wooden or earthen vessels for eating purposes, but now all kinds of metal vessels are to be seen. A stock of wood, ghi, baskets for grain, ropes, potatoes, mats of halidi, a scythe, a hood-grass sickle, knife and hatchet, and a pitara for clothes generally constitute the only property of the poorer classes.\n\nPeople of the higher classes in order to secure privacy build their houses in the form of a chauki or quadrangle, the rooms and windows all facing inwards and the whole being encircled\nby a hedge of trees and brambles which serve as a *pardah*. The Rajputs build their houses in secluded spots and do not allow anyone else to erect a house overlooking their own. They build a wall of stones about 6 feet high all round the compound for the sake of protection as well as seclusion.\n\nIf a child dies before it is 6 months old, the body is thrown into a river; between 6 and 18 months it is buried, and after that age burned. The body is cremated as soon as the preparations are complete; whether it is day or night. Balls of rice are offered inside the house, in the porch, in Shiva's temple, near the pyre, when setting fire to the pile, and when smashing the skull. A wick 10 cubits long is made, and is divided into 10 equal parts by 9 knots. The lamp in which this wick is used is kept burning for 10 days and is watched lest it go out. Balls of rice are also offered for 10 days in the morning, and in the evening the *dik\u0101\u015bhta* rite is observed for 9 days. This consists in making daily offerings to the dead in cups of leaves which are filled with water, milk, flowers, etc., and placed with a lighted lamp on the road by which the corpse was taken to the burning ground, a place where four roads meet being preferred. A *chatti*, with a small hole in the bottom through which water trickles drop by drop is also filled with water morning and evening. Relations, friends and others gather together for condolence and express their sorrow. On the 10th day the *chatti* and lamp are taken to a river or stream and thrown into the running water. *Pinni* is also performed the first 10 days after death. *Kirya* or the observance of funeral rites for 11 days among Br\u0101hmans, for 13 among Rajputs, for 16 among Bohras and 30 among Kanets. Men of all castes alike go to a river or *khad* to wash their clothes on the 10th day.\n\nIf a man dies in the *panchak* days, certain offerings are made and prayers said to remove any ill effects. No regard is paid to a death in the *chitra* or *m\u016bl*. No days are looked upon as unlucky for death, nor is any notice taken if a man whose name begins with the same syllable as that of a relation of his dies.\n\nIf a man falls ill, astrologers are consulted as to what charitable deed will secure his recovery. Burning grounds are not reverenced.\n\nIf a man dies suddenly or commits suicide, he is held not to have obtained salvation and *Nariin Bali* is performed.\n\nSome people send the ashes of their dead to the Ganges within 10 days after death; others send them before the next eclipse and, till then they are kept hanging on the wall in a silk purse. They are put in the purse after being washed with Ganges water and the *Panchamrit*. When being carried to the Ganges the purse is hung round the neck.\n\nAll castes in State perform *sudhak* within 20 days after death with the exception of the R\u0101hys and Khas divisions of the hill Kanets, who sacrifice a goat within 10 and 13 days respectively.\nBr\u0101hmans get purified in 11, R\u0101jp\u016bts, Kanets and Khatris in 13, Bohras in 16, and S\u016bdras in 35 days. R\u0101h\u016bs are purified in 10 days and Khas in 12. Meat, asafoetida, bread roasted in ghi, red d\u0101l and milk are not eaten for 10 days. Maski (monthly) and barkhi (yearly) offerings are made which only the Acharyas are allowed to take, other Br\u0101hmans refusing to accept them. On the maski day food and grain up to two maunds (32 sers) are given, and on the anniversary bedding, a cot, clothes, some vessels, etc., are given. In some parts two chhaubarkhar (fourth anniversary) are observed the expenses of which vary with the means of the worshipper.\n\nTwo shar\u0101dhs are given, one in each year on the date on which the death occurs, and the other on the corresponding date in the Kandrat fortnight.\n\nWhen a woman prepared to become sati she used to put a stone in a certain place. Others followed her example, so that a large cairn of stones was made. The cairn was called chharda and was worshipped twice a year, at the spring and autumn harvests.\n\nThe Naur\u0101tras in Chet are the most auspicious days for marriage. Betrothals and tonsure ceremonies are also performed in this month. Bais\u0101kh is supposed to be the best for charitable acts. Marriages are generally celebrated in this and the succeeding month of Jeth. In H\u0101r the Beas Puja ceremony is observed, at which people offer presents to their spiritual guides or Gur\u016bs and show reverence to them. Women of the higher classes worship the b\u0101r and pipal trees and platforms for the shelter of travellers are built round shady trees. On the first of S\u0101wan, priests send their followers a charm of 34 figures which is placed over the door of every room in the house.\n\nThe figures of this charm when added vertically, diagonally or horizontally make 34. Women visit the temple of Bh\u016bt N\u0101th every Monday and sing hymns of prayer with earthen lamps in their hands. Bh\u0101don is the most unhealthy month because a d\u0101yan or female monster of the hills thirsts for blood and kills people to satiate her desire. Hence on the R\u0101khri or Salcno days, Br\u0101hmans give threads to their followers for protection against the evil days, and on the first of Assuj the S\u0101yar festivity is held in joy at the close of the season. Houses are whitewashed and plastered, and sweetmeats distributed among friends and near relations. The Janam Ashtmi or birthday of Krishna is also celebrated in this month and all Hindus fast and pay their devotions to the god.\n\nThe Dasehra procession is celebrated with great eclat, buffaloes and goats being sacrificed before the altar of Shi\u0101ma Kali. K\u0101tik is observed by bathing in the river and giving alms to the poor.\nPos is a dull month and no festival is held in it. M\u00e1gh is auspicious for festivities and marriages are often held in it.\n\nThe Shiv R\u00e1tri is held in Ph\u00e1g\u00e1n and is followed by the Holi.\n\nThe population of Mandi State according to the Census of 1901 was 174,045, viz.\u2014\n\n| Religion     | Population |\n|--------------|------------|\n| Hindus       | 170,304    |\n| Mohammadans  | 3,187      |\n| Buddhists    | 510        |\n| Sikhs        | 41         |\n| Christians   | 3          |\n\nThe Mohammadans (not including the pastoral Gujars) originally came from Afghanistan, Kashmir, and the plains of the Punjab; many are in the service of the State. The Afghans, locally called Rohelas, were employed as soldiers in the time of Raja Balbir Sen. Their descendants are now permanent residents of Mandi and form as it were an hereditary class of palace guards.\n\nThe Kashmiri Musalmans are chiefly shawl-makers in Mandi town. There are two mosques in the town of Mandi. One was built by Shekh Ghul\u00e1m Mohi-ud-din in 1841 A.D. after his appointment by the Sikhs as Governor of the hills. The other was made by the Rohelas.\n\nBuddhists.\u2014The Buddhists are Residents of Lehul, Spiti and Bhutan. They come down to Mandi in winter to earn money by keeping rice beer shops. Some of them own ponies and carry wool, etc., to Hoshiarpur.\n\nSikhs.\u2014Sikhs include traders from the Hoshiarpur District. There are a few goldsmiths and carpenters resident in the town.\n\nA Sikh temple was built by Raja Sidh Sen to commemorate the visit of Guru Govind Singh to his capital at the end of the sixteenth century. The expenses are met by a grant of land. A gun, a pair of wooden shoes, a bed and a rab\u00e1b, presents made by the Guru, are held in great veneration.\n\nThere is another Sikh temple at K\u00e1ndhl\u00ed in charge of an Id\u00e1si S\u00e1dh\u00fa. Some R\u00e1jputs claim to be Masands or tithe collectors on the ground that they did some sort of service to the Guru during his stay in Mandi. They have been returned as Hindus in the Census papers.\n\nHindus.\u2014The Hindus nominally worship all the Pur\u00e1nic gods 33 crores in number. The higher classes are taught the Gayatri 'mantra' when children by the family priest. These sacred words are only imparted in a whisper. Later, an 'Isht Deota' or favourite god is chosen and specially worshipped.\nAn eclipse day is considered particularly favourable for religious ceremonies in honour of the Isht Deota. On such a day fasting is observed and religious instruction received from Br\u00e1hmans.\n\nGenerally speaking, Hindus worship five deities, viz., Vishnu, Shiva, Ganesh, Suraj and Devi.\n\nThese gods are usually placed on a platform, the Isht Deota being added and put in the centre in the place of honour. This form of worship is called Pancha-yatu.\n\n(1) Devi is a popular object of veneration all over the State. This goddess goes by several names, viz. Sri Vidya, B\u00e1l\u00e1, K\u00e1l\u00ed, T\u00e1r\u00e1, Bagl\u00e1 and Durg\u00e1. A goat is her usual sacrifice.\n\n(a) Sri Vidya, known also as Rajeshwri, is depicted as having four arms and holding the top of a man's skull (p\u00e1ka or p\u00e1sha), an elephant goad (ankush), a bow (dhanush) and an arrow (b\u00e1n). She wears red garments and has a half-moon on her forehead. She is supposed to be the giver of wealth and happiness. Her bedstead is supported by Brahma, Vishnu, Indra and Shiva. She lives in the M\u00e1n Dwip of heaven. There is a temple of this goddess in the Raja's palace, the old Rajas of Mandi being among her worshippers.\n\n(b) B\u00e1l\u00e1 Devi has also four arms. In one hand is a sacred book, in another a string of beads. A third hand is stretched forth as if in the act of giving what has been asked, fourth is supposed to be making a sign of having removed all fears.\n\n(c) K\u00e1l\u00ed has many forms. She is usually shown, holding a lotus, shell (conch or shaukh), discus and club. Her shrine is on the edge of the large tank in Mandi. Dichhat Br\u00e1hmans are her chief devotees.\n\n(d) T\u00e1r\u00e1 has four arms and holds a pair of scissors, a sword, a skull and a lotus flower. A four tongued serpent is shown in her matted hair.\n\nThe great Shiy\u00e1m\u00e1 K\u00e1l\u00ed temple built by Raja Shiy\u00e1m\u00e1 Sen in 1659 A.D. has a statue of this goddess.\n\nDuring the Nauratra days in September Hindus of all classes visit this temple and sacrifice a goat to the goddess. The ceilings of the temple are decorated with paintings in gold and silver.\n\n(e) Bagl\u00e1 Mukhi Devi is so named because her face resembles that of a heron. She wears yellow garments. In one hand she holds a club, in the other a demon's tongue.\n\nThe Prohits of the ruling family are followers of this goddess.\n\n(f) Durga or Bh\u00e1v\u00e1n\u00ed is represented as riding on a tiger. She is worshipped by all classes during the September Nauratras. Her sacred writings are the Devi Pur\u00e1n, a part of the Markanda Pur\u00e1n and the Chandi P\u00e1th. Her followers are divided into two\nCHAP. I. C. sects, viz., V\u00e1m\u00e1ch\u00e1r\u00eds and Dakshan\u00e1ch\u00e1r\u00eds. Most of the Br\u00e1hmans and Khatris are Dakshan\u00e1ch\u00e1r\u00eds. The V\u00e1m\u00e1ch\u00e1r\u00eds hold their religious meetings secretly and eat and drink freely. The Dakshn\u00e1ch\u00e1r\u00eds, also known as Sh\u00e1ktiks do not offer liquor to the goddess and look with disfavour on the loose practices of the V\u00e1m\u00e1ch\u00e1r\u00eds.\n\n(2) Shiva, whose emblem is the 'linga', is worshipped chiefly by Br\u00e1hmans, R\u00e1jp\u00fats, Khatris and Bohras.\n\nThe sacred bull Nanda, the Steed of Shiva, has his altar attached to all the shrines of the g.d. Shiva's consort Gaura is often shown as riding on the bull with him. Offerings of flowers and leaves are made to this deity.\n\nShiva is known in several forms. The commonest of these (whose temple is on the left side of the Beas) is that of 'Pancha baktra' or five faced Shiva, the three faced Shiva is known as Tirlokn\u00e1th. His temple is on the right side of the river. Another form of Shiva is that of 'Ardh Nareshwara', with half the body of Shiva and half of his consort P\u00e1rbati or Gaura. A temple in Samkhetar street in Mandi is dedicated to this form.\n\nThere is a very old temple in Mandi for Shiva worship known 'Bh\u00fat N\u00e1th'. The pinnacle of its dome is gold plated. The late Raja Bijai Sen had an entrance gate made in Lucknow decorated with gold and silver and presented it to the temple.\n\nThere is an interesting legend connected with the discovery of the Bh\u00fat N\u00e1th idol. In olden days the land on the left bank of the Be\u00e1s was waste and there the cattle of the neighbouring villages used to graze. A cow was seen to give her milk to a piece of stone on this waste land. Raja Ajbar Sen dreamt that he was ordered by the god (Shiva) to dig under the stone. The Raja did so and the idol now worshipped was discovered, and temple built for its reception.\n\nB\u00e1lakn\u00e1th, the son of Shiva has his followers. There is a temple dedicated to this deity on the bank of the Beas.\n\n(3) Ganpati or Ganesh the elephant headed divinity is worshipped by Hindus of the higher classes. He is the most dutiful son of Shiva and is the first invoked and propitiated in every undertaking. He is four armed and holds a disc, warshell, club and lotus. His steed is a rat. His image at the door of a house is considered a protection from evil. Raja Sidh Sen built a temple for this deity and added an image of his own size.\n\n(4) There are a few Br\u00e1hmans and Khatris who reverence Bhairon, a disciple of Shiva. His image is painted on a piece of paper and worshipped. A temple on the edge of the great tank in Mandi belongs to this deity and is known as Sidh Bhairon. Prayers are offered four times a day, viz., at day break, noon, sunset and midnight.\nOut of 49 places of worship in Mandi town (44 being temples proper) no less than 24 are dedicated to Shiva. The Gosains of Mandi are followers of Shiva. Their dead are buried in sitting posture and tumuli, generally conical in form, erected over them. This sect has declined in importance. The priests are known as Mahants, they do not marry but adopt chelas. Their shrines are called 'Mats'.\n\n(5) Vaishnavas. There are very few Vaishnavas in Mandi. They worship Salig Ram, Gop\u00e1l and Lakshmi. The women are worshippers of R\u00e1ma, not of Salig Ram, whose image they are not even allowed to touch.\n\nGop\u00e1l Ji (Krishna) the pastoral deity of Vrij is supposed to be a cow herdsman (g\u00e1o-pal).\n\nThe Madho Rai temple in Mandi is dedicated to him in his character of Murlidhar or flute-player. Bhima, a Mandi goldsmith, made a silver image of this god in Sambat 1705. The translation of the Sanskrit inscription on Madho Rai's image is as follows:\n\n\"Bhim the goldsmith made this irreproachable image of the blessed Discus-hearer, the Master of all the gods, Sri Madhava Rai (i.e., Krishna) in the reign of Surgya Sena the King, the destroyer of his rivals, the moon being in the lunar mansion Jivhya, in the year Arron (=5) air (=0) Prophet (=7) Jate (=1), on Thursday on the auspicious lunar day Arron (=5) Jate (=1) the month Japas (i.e., Phalguna).\n\nThis gives the date Thursday the 15th (lunar) day of Phalguna of the year 1705 (i.e., A.D. 1648).\n\nRaja Suraj Sen having lost 18 sons and having no successor to the throne in despair made over the State to the god Madho Rai administering it on the god's behalf. The fiction that this god is the head of the State is still nominally retained.\n\nAll the village deities pay a yearly visit to this the head god in Mandi during the 'Shibratr\u00ed j\u00e1t\u00e1'.\n\nA very large number of priests, musicians and followers accompany the deities.\n\nThe amount of drunkenness prevalent among the hill-men during this visit is not to be commended.\n\nThere are three other Vaishnava temples, viz., Ram Chandra, Jaggan Nath and one at Bindr\u00e1b\u00e1ni 2 miles up the river from Mandi. Married women, usually worship Gaura (consort of Shiva), whose image is given to a girl by her parents at the time of her marriage.\n\nLakshmi, the goddess of wealth is also worshipped as the wife of Vishnu. She is shown as holding a lotus flower and the p\u00e1kha.\n\n(6) Jog\u00eds and N\u00e1ths worship Gug\u00e1 only. Some R\u00e1jp\u00fats of the Saroch and Path\u00e1nia clans have built shrines of Guga in which\nstone images of Gorakh Nath, Machhendra Nath, Bhairo, Nar Sing, Kailu, Hanuman, Sirkhand, Fatt\u00e1, Gugri and Ghog\u00e1 are placed. Very few Br\u00e1hmans and Khatris are followers of this cult.\n\nThe Hind\u00fas of the lower classes believe in the Siddhas who are represented as pupils of Gorakh Nath. There is a large Siddh shrine at Balakr\u00fap\u00ed in Kami\u00e1h and a smaller one at Ha\u00edlf. A few Khatris and Kanets visit these places hoping to get cured of their diseases.\n\n(7) Among trees the 'pipal' is almost universally venerated. It is very common for platforms to be made under these trees by charitable persons for the comfort of travellers.\n\n(8) Br\u00e1hmans and Khatris erect a platform in their courtyards and plant the holy basil (Tulsi) which is worshipped by the women folk.\n\n(9) Local deities. The hill people are not followers of the Vedic form of religion. Nearly every village has its own local deity, and on all occasions of birth and marriage, devotions are paid to this Devi or Deota. Most of these deities are Rishis or Saints of the Hindu mythology, but others are named after the hills on which they are situated. Each idol has a collection of fairly well carved faces on metal plates which are joined together and put in rows one above the other.\n\nThe image is carried on a chair without legs. This chair is attached to 2 poles and decorated with cloths of different colours. The whole is carried by four men by means of poles. The metal plates are mostly brass though there are some of silver and gold. The idol is accompanied by priests, musicians and dancers, men and women. Some gods are supposed to be rain-givers. In time of scarcity their priests are commanded by the Raja to pray the Devi to supply rain.\n\nIf a downpour ensues it is attributed to the good will of the Devi, if not the priests say that some heinous offence has been committed by the people. Nar\u00e1yan, Pasakot and Phugni Devi in Choh\u00e1r are supposed to be rain-givers. Nar\u00e1yan and Pas\u00e1kot dislike smoking. Tobacco is not allowed in the compounds of their temples. Visitors get provisions from the temples free of charge. Tandi, Latogli, and Tungasi are famous deities in Sar\u00e1j.\n\nPar\u00e1sar, named after a Rishi, is situated in Sanor. In the month of Har a large fair is held. Kulu and Mandi people, to the numbers of four thousand gather together. Wood and cloth are largely sold. Barn\u00e1g of Tikoli is another important deity in Sanor. A fair is held, at which some five thousand pilgrims assemble. Blankets (patt\u00fa) opium and wool are sold.\n\nKamr\u00e1 N\u00e1g is a stone idol in N\u00e1chan. It is very old being said to be of the time of the Pandav\u00e1s. Its temple is situated on the borders of Suket and Mandi. This god is worshipped, because he is supposed to remove epidemic diseases.\nShik\u00e1ri Devi in N\u00e1chan inhabits a very high hill. She is very fond of the blood of goats. Tunga Devi in Sanor, when offended, said to kill people by lightning and is angry when any one is defiled by an evil action.\n\nB\u00e1lakrupi is another famous temple of Shiva in Bhang\u00e1l. The god is supposed to remove ailments of all kinds and is worshipped to ensure recovery from severe illness.\n\nTonsure ceremonies of children among the higher classes are performed at its shrine, and at each harvest a quantity of corn is offered to the deity before that harvest is used by the agriculturists.\n\nEvery year on the night of the 16th Bh\u00e1don all the deot\u00e1s congregate at Dh\u00e1r Kambogir in the Mandi State. The four jogn\u00eds from the east, west, south and north also come and a battle rages between them and deot\u00e1s, until one party defeats the other. If the deot\u00e1s win, the lands yield a good harvest that year, but the victory of the jogn\u00eds is calculated to bring famine.\n\nThe following facts have been given in proof of the above story:\n\n1. Buffaloes and other cattle graze day and night on the dh\u00e1r. On the night mentioned the owners of cattle bring their she-buffaloes down from the Dh\u00e1r Kambogir lest the jogn\u00eds kill them.\n\n2. On the night of the 16th Bh\u00e1don the Hindus of the Hill States in neighbourhood of Mandi distribute rapeseed in order to avert the influence of the jogn\u00eds.\n\nNangol Mahadeo in Lad has innumerable natural idols of Shiva. A Gaddi having committed some offence incurred its wrath and was turned into stone. On the 5th of Bais\u00e1kh a large fair is held at Nawah\u00ed Devi's temple at Anantpur. Some ten thousand visitors gather from Mandi and Ham\u00edrpur Tehsil. This temple has many smaller ones all round which have been traced back to an ancient date.\n\nOn the 2nd of Sawan a fair takes place at Bar\u00e1rt\u00e1 Deo on Lind\u00ed Dh\u00e1r. Some three thousand persons attend. This Deo is considered to have efficacy in the case of barren she-buffaloes.\nCHAPTER II.\u2014ECONOMIC.\n\nSection A.\u2014Agriculture.\n\nThough the country is hilly, and large tracts of it defy cultivation, the zamindars make the most of it, and every stream, however small, is made to contribute to irrigation. The system of embanking a khad is carried further in Mandi than in the rich plains of the Punjab, and it is not uncommon to see a succession of 50 or 60 fields, one above the other on a hill side, testifying to an infinite patience and capacity for labour, at least in the preliminary stages of agricultural operations.\n\nThe people distinguish three kinds of soil:\n\n1. Kulhi jahi or irrigated land.\n2. Autri barani or unirrigated land.\n3. Nad, an inferior kind of land.\n\nKulhi or irrigated lands yield a good crop of rice, maize, kodra or mandal (Eleusine coracana) and other millets in the autumn harvest, or sayar; and wheat, barley, tobacco and poppy in the spring harvest, or niyai. In the higher valleys these lands are called ropai or rice land. Autri or unirrigated land produces every sort of grain. In addition to the spring crop of wheat, barley, masar, oilseeds, gram, tobacco, and poppy, several kinds of millets, (kulth, bithu, kathu, bhiresa) and pulses as well as rice and maize are grown in the autumn harvest. Unirrigated lands in the upper valleys are called gadi.\n\nNad land produces one crop only a year, viz., rice, while the irrigated and unirrigated lands yield two crops. The lands in which two crops are regularly cultivated are called dhvad. Some pieces of land are cultivated alternately. Such lands as are not cultivated in sayar or autumn and are reserved for a spring crop are called basniar by the zamindars, while lands cultivated in autumn and left uncultivated in the spring are named bhrayi.\n\nThe number of ploughings varies according to the kind of crop, but the land is often ploughed ten or twelve times before the seed is sown. A plough driven by oxen breaks the soil to a depth of about three inches, and the ploughman on reaching the end of the field returns upon the same track. After ploughing, the clod crusher with a heavy club in his hands, reduces the stiff clods to dust. The mahi is then brought into use to smoothe the surface. The field is then ready to receive the seed, the plough is again brought, and the sower follows the furrow, throwing the seed from right to left and discharging his handful in five casts. When a field is thus reploughed and sown, the mahi again comes on the\nscene to level the soil. For wheat and the other spring crops weeding with hoes is never practised. After rain, when the surface of the field has hardened round the young shoots, the soil is broken and loosened with the harrow, and just before maturity weeds are pulled up by hand and given to the cattle. In reaping, corn is cut near the root with a sickle and tied into sheaves. Threshing is then begun, muzzled oxen tread out the corn. Maize is threshed by hand, as its hard cobs bruise and draw blood from the feet of the cattle.\n\nThe following list shows the principal agricultural implements and their approximate cost:\n\n| Vernacular name | Description | Probable cost |\n|-----------------|-------------|---------------|\n| Mahi            | a flat block of wood dragged by oxen over a field to smooth its surface | Rs. a. p. 0 3 0 |\n| Mahena          | the same, used only on muddy land | 0 2 6 |\n| Dandral         | a harrow with 9 or 10 bamboo teeth dragged by oxen to open the soil round the young corn | 0 6 0 |\n| Phalaunta       | a wooden club for crushing stiff clods of earth | 0 0 6 |\n| Triningul       | a three-pronged pitch-fork used for threshing corn | 1 0 0 |\n| Dranti          | a sickle | 0 4 0 |\n| Koddi           | a hoe | 0 8 0 |\n| Chhahu          | an axe | 1 0 0 |\n| Ghan            | a hammer for breaking stones | 1 0 0 |\n| Jhamb           | a mattock used for the repair of canals | 0 4 0 |\n| Nih\u00e1n           | a chisel | 0 2 0 |\n| Kahi            | a hoe for weeding | 0 2 0 |\n\nThe numbers of the agricultural classes are given below:\n\n(1) M\u00e1lguz\u00e1rs who cultivate themselves:\n   - Males: 37,852\n   - Females: 2,381\n   - Dependents: 67,840\n   Total: 108,073\n\n(2) Tenants who cultivate land-holders' lands:\n   - Males: 7,440\n   - Females: 560\n   - Dependents: 12,877\n   Total: 20,877\n\nGrand Total: 128,950\n\nOut of a total population of 174,045 nearly 75 per cent. thus depend entirely on agriculture, supplementing the yield of their fields by the produce of their flocks and by rude home manufactures with which they occupy themselves in their leisure hours.\n\nRice is the staple crop for the autumn harvest. It is sown broadcast in the lower hills, and when the monsoon rains are regular and plentiful a very large area is cropped.\nIt is sown in nurseries in inferior high lands where the grass growing wild would impede the growth of rice sown broadcast. It is sown in the nurseries in May and planted out in the fields in June and July and harvested in October.\n\nThere are many varieties of rice. Those of the 1st class are: basmati, begmi, jhunjhan, r\u00e1m ju\u00e1ni, ranghri, pardesi, tot\u00e1 r\u00e1m, salhi sukhd\u00e1s, jhiw\u00e1n, dh\u00e1nkar and ruhan.\n\nThose of the 2nd class are: nikand\u00e1, j\u00e1ndarl\u00e9, munji, sali, munjh\u00e1ra, ujl\u00e1, j\u00e1t\u00fa, nikand\u00ed, gy\u00e1li, gy\u00e1su. Those of the 3rd class are: s\u00e1th\u00fa, r\u00f3r\u00e1, katehri.\n\nBasmati rice is the most valuable: it is found in the Hatli and Ner waziris. Begmi, r\u00e1m ju\u00e1ni are also fine varieties and are exported on camels from Hatli and Anantpur waziris. All the other varieties of rice are found in H\u00e1t Garh, Mast Garh, Machhrot, K\u00e1san, Ner Garh, and Ballh.\n\nMaize grows everywhere throughout the hills. It requires but little rain and suffers from excessive rainfall and moisture of the soil. Being of small commercial value it is the commonest food of the agricultural classes. The best kind of maize is produced in Khanw\u00e1l, a village in Pichh\u00edt waziri. It grows abundantly in the Ballh, Hatli, Sanor and Kaml\u00e1h waziris.\n\nOf the various pulses m\u00e1sh or m\u00e1h (Phaseolus radiatus) is the best and most esteemed. Dr. ngsira and Tungal produce the best kinds. It is sown in July and harvested in November. The grain is used as d\u00e1l and made into bar\u00eds by being soaked in water, pounded with a stone and dried, Kulth (Dolichos reniflorus), the commonest and poorest pulse of all, is generally cultivated on high meagre soils. M\u00e1h and kulth are frequently grown together.\n\nVarious kinds of millet are cultivated on the higher hills. Of these kodr\u00e1 or mandal (Eleusine coracana), china (Panicum miliaceum), bhire-a (Fagopyrum emar inatum), kangni (Pennisetum vulgare) and saj\u00e1ra are sown in May and June in the higher lands. Chi-a and kangni are sown together and kodr\u00e1 as well as saj\u00e1ra are also added to the combination. All these millets are abundantly cultivated in Sar\u00e1j, Nachan, Choh\u00e1r, Bad\u00e1r and Uttars\u00e1l. Bread is made of kodr\u00e1 and bhiresa while china and kangni are stored to feed the cattle during the winter.\n\nCotton is cultivated in Ballh, Hatli, Anantpur, Kaml\u00e1h and Pichh\u00edt. It is sown in April and ripens about November.\n\nPotatoes grow abundantly in Choh\u00e1r, Sanor and Kaml\u00e1h. In Sar\u00e1j wild potatoes are to be found. Potatoes are largely exported to the plains from Choh\u00e1r.\n\nTurmeric is generally cultivated on the low, moist lands of Pindoh and Kippar. It is planted in May and does not mature till the end of November.\nThe staple crops in the spring are wheat and barley. Wheat is the more important of the two as a revenue-paying crop. It is usually sown in September as soon as the rains cease. In the lower hills it is sown soon after the Kharif crop has been cleared and is harvested in June. Barley is generally cultivated on poor soils. The best kind of wheat is produced in Pindoh, Balbh and Hatli. Wheat produced in the higher hills is large in the grain but its quality is inferior.\n\nGram is cultivated in the low lands. It suffers from excess of water during the rains, and is produced for local consumption only, in Balbh, Hatli, Anantpur and Kamliah.\n\nTobacco grows in the low valley on the best barani and sometimes on irrigated lands. It is sown in July and is matured in November and December. It is not much esteemed.\n\nSugarcane is largely cultivated on the best lands of the Balbh Valley. The gur produce appears to be of an average quality and is only used for local consumption. It is inferior to the Kangra gur, which is largely imported into the State.\n\nTea was introduced in the year 1865. As the results were favourable its cultivation was greatly encouraged, and in consequence many tea-gardens belonging to private persons were soon flourishing along the border of Bir Bangahal, where the climate is very suitable for tea cultivation. The State maintains two large gardens at Sukhabagh and Dhelhi and the outturn now amounts to about 40,000 pounds in all.\n\nThe poppy is sown in October on the best manured highlands. When the young plants shoot up, frequent weeding is necessary. When the poppy heads are ready, two or three slits are made in each of them in the evening and the next day the juice that oozes out of the slits is collected. The juice is extracted twice from the same poppy-head. Opium is prepared in Chohar, Badar and Saraj. The land in the Mandi valley does not suit the poppy.\n\nGrass is not cultivated for hay, as the steep hill sides incapable of cultivation are covered with grass suitable for fodder. Such lands are called kharyatir. The people cut grass in September and October, this when dried makes good fodder for all kinds of cattle in winter. This grass does not lose its greenness even when dried and is called sarli. If cut late its colour when dried changes to brown and is supposed to be inferior to sarli. It is called kattal. Grass growing in fields of maize, rice, mash or pulse is cut and serves as a green fodder for cattle. It increases the milk of cows and buffaloes, and is known as sanha. Its refuse collected and dried serves again as fodder and is called juth. Several varieties of hay of wild growth are found on the kharyatir hills. Kharmakora grows on barren hills during the rains and is cut in November and December. It is used for thatching huts. An inferior kind is called dhaula from its brown colour and brooms are made of it.\nBagga is grown on rocky hills and by twisting it together ropes are manufactured. Beohal is a tree whose leaves are also used as fodder.\n\nThe following statement gives the outturn of the principal crops per kh\u0101r on the best land:\n\n| Crop          | Soil                  | Quantity of Seed | Outturn |\n|---------------|-----------------------|------------------|---------|\n|               |                       | In lakhs         | In kachha manras | In kh\u0101rde and Zabbe, In kachha manras | Proportion of out-turn to seed |\n| Rice          | on irrigated land     | 5 lakhs          | 7\u00bd      | 4\u00bd   | 120 | 15 fold |\n|               | on unirrigated land   | 5                | 7\u00bd      | 1\u00bd   | 45  | 6     |\n| Wheat         | on irrigated land     | 2\u00bd               | 5       | 1\u00bd   | 60  | 12    |\n|               | on unirrigated land   | 5                | 7\u00bd      | 2\u00bd   | 60  | 8     |\n| Barley        | on irrigated land     | 5                | 7\u00bd      | 5    | 120 | 15    |\n|               | on unirrigated land   | 5                | 7\u00bd      | 1\u00bd   | 45  | 6     |\n| Buck-wheat    | Do, do                | 1\u00bd               | 2\u00bd      | 25   | 50  | 20    |\n| M\u0101sh (Phaseolus radiatus) | Do, do | 5 sars. | ... | 50 sars. | 10 |\n| Gram          | Do, do                | 5                | 5       | 25   | 12  |       |\n| Maize         | Do, do                | 14 lakhs         | 2\u00bd mds. | 25 lakhs | 50 lakhs | 20 |\n\nThe principal causes of debt among the agricultural classes are marriage expenses, and the high rates of interest. A woman will leave her husband and attach herself to another man, who then pays Rs. 150 or Rs. 200 to the first husband, with the result that the first marriage is annulled and the woman becomes the wife of her new lover. The poorer agriculturists on the failure of a crop have to borrow grain from the Khatri bankers, whose rates of interest are 2 or 3 per cent. per mensem and compound interest is generally charged. The law has, however, been changed and the courts now as a rule do not allow a higher rate than 1 per cent. per mensem.\n\nThere are some waste and grazing lands included within the boundaries of each village or gr\u0101on. The grazing land is left for cattle while all the waste belongs to the State and no tenant has power to reclaim without the permission of the Darb\u0101r. There are some small patches of waste in and among the fields and enclosures which are included in the leases granted by the State. These remain in the possession of their respective holders as waste and are charged with an increased rent when they are broken up and added to the field. The holders have, however, a right to construct channels through them for the use of their fields from a stream or river.\n\nThe m\u0101lguz\u0101rs who do not themselves cultivate land are more in debt than those who do. The tenants of j\u0101gird\u0101rs, m\u0101jidd\u0101rs, and s\u0101sand\u0101rs are comparatively poorer than the tenants of m\u0101lguz\u0101rs. Of the tenants, those who pay cash rents are in better circumstances than those whose rents are fixed at a share of the produce.\nSection B.\u2014Live Stock.\n\nThe cattle are generally very small in size but fairly strong. A bullock is not worked till he is four years old and a pair of ordinary plough oxen may be purchased for Rs. 20. A cow generally gives 2 sers pakka of milk and can be had for Rs. 16.\n\nA buffalo gives up to 6 pakka sers of milk and the best are sold for Rs. 50 each. They are kept principally by G\u00fajars and their milk is used to make ghi which is exported to Simla and the K\u00e1ngra District. The Hindu G\u00fajars settled in Mandi will often combine a little agriculture with their normal pastoral occupation, but the Muhammadan G\u00fajar never does so. The pastures are leased out just as they are in K\u00e1ngra, to zam\u00ednd\u00e1rs from that District, who bring their cattle in to Mandi for three months from May or June. On the higher hills some Muhammadan G\u00fajars who own large flocks have obtained permanent leases of their pasture grounds and pay a fixed annual sum. In all other cases, resident owners of buffaloes are taxed in kind, 5 or 6\u00bd sers of ghi being the charge on each milch-cow whether the property of a G\u00fajar or of an enterprising landowner who keeps a few buffaloes on the waste land near his own. Those who come in from K\u00e1ngra are taxed at the rate of 12 annas for a milch-cow, 8 annas for a barren one, and 4 annas for a calf. This tax brings in about Rs. 1,000 annually. Buffaloes are not employed either in field labour or in haulage.\n\nThere are but very few ponies and mules although there is plenty of grazing. An attempt has been made to promote mule-breeding, and two Syrian donkey stallions have been sent for.\n\nLand-holders who have waste lands close to their cultivation keep goats and sheep for their wool. Sheep are shorn two or three times a year and the average annual yield of wool per sheep is one ser pakka which realizes eight annas. The people manufacture blankets, pattus and other clothes of the wool for ordinary use; while selis or thick rugs are made of goat-skin, which serve as waterproofs in the winter rains. The cultivators of Mandi who keep flocks of sheep pay grazing dues called chhap\u00e1n\u00ed and gan\u00e1kar. Chhap\u00e1n\u00ed means a fifth or sixth. In the time of Raja Sidh Sen a number of goats for breeding purposes were lent to the cultivators and one-sixth of the produce was demanded from them as the State\u2019s share of the profit. These cultivators have still to pay chhap\u00e1n\u00ed on the number of the flock. Gan\u00e1kri, at the rate of one goat per lot of twenty, is realized as a grazing due from the other cultivators of Mandi. If they want to pay in cash Re. 1 is charged. The number of sheep owned by Mandi cultivators is roughly estimated to be 4,500. Some foreign Gadd\u00eds from K\u00e1ngra and Chamba with very large flocks of sheep and goats visit Mandi in the winter from October to March and farm the forests of the lower valleys for grazing. They have to pay grazing dues at the rate of 9 pies per head, or Rs. 4-11 per hundred. About 40,000 sheep are thus grazed in winter by the shepherds of\nBashahr, P\u00e1lampur, K\u00e1ngra and K\u00fal\u00e1 and the grazing dues amount to Rs. 1,860. In the beginning of winter many flocks coming from Lahul and K\u00fal\u00e1 on their way to the lower hills of K\u00e1ngra, Mandi and Suket cross the Bhabu and Dulchi Passes. A flock or kandah consists of from 500 to 1,200 sheep, three or four Gadd\u00eds followed by as many dogs accompanying the flock. A toll of Rs. 2 in cash plus a goat per flock is levied at the Ul bridge on the Bubu route, and at the Empress Bridge on the Be\u00e1s on the Dulchi route.\n\nSection C.\u2014Forests.\n\nThe State forests have always been looked after by r\u0101khas, or forest guards, but no scientific management has been attempted in the past. Now, however, two students have been sent to the Forest School at Dehra Dun to learn forestry and a Forest Department is being organized.\n\nThe commonest trees are on the higher ranges, rai, tos, chil, kail and kelo. Kail is found chiefly in Sar\u00e1j, Sanor and Nachan, growing with kelo. Box-wood is also found but less commonly. On the lower hills the principal trees are tun, alsan, simbal, ohi, khirak and khanur.\n\nThe fruit trees are those generally found in the hills\u2014walnut, apricot, plum, plantain, pear, peach and pomegranate; kafal, trumal and mulberry in Kamlah and Sandhol; oranges, jambolin, figs, lemons of several kinds, citron and apples are found also.\n\nThe following table gives useful trees and shrubs:\n\n| Hill name | English name | Botanical name | Remarks |\n|-----------|--------------|----------------|---------|\n| D.

Iron is the metal most widely found, but gold is also found in small quantities in the bed of the Son stream, a tributary of the Beas on its left bank. Lignite is also found in insignificant quantities and several slate quarries are being worked. The salt mines contribute about one-third of the State revenue.\n\nIron is found in Sarai, Nachan, Pandoh, Chohar and Sanor in small quantities in the form of crystals of magnetic oxide of iron embedded in decomposed and friable mica schists. Throughout the\nSaraj waziri, iron is found in practically inexhaustible quantities. It is collected during the rains when slips on the face of the hill expose the veins to a considerable extent and the schist at the same time is particularly soft. It is melted at several places. The method of working is very simple. It is melted in a smelting furnace, which is about two feet in height and one in diameter. The furnace stands upon an iron grating with a hollow in the ground underneath to receive the molten metal and bellows are attached to either side. The fuel used is charcoal of the chil, rai or tos. In manufacturing one man of iron, 15 mans of charcoal are required, and this means the consumption of a whole rai or tos tree costing at least Re. 1. Seven men have to work on it, each getting three annas a day; thus one man of iron costs about Rs. 2-5 and in the Mandi market it realizes about Rs. 2-2, so that the smelting results in a loss of three annas per man. In 1845, the income from iron was Rs. 14,000 but it fell to Rs. 2,737 in 1891 while wood was supplied by the Forest Department free of charge. The manufacture is carried on under petty leases granted yearly to the Mandi Khatris. The existing forests would be quite insufficient to work this iron on an extensive scale. The net annual value of the outturn is now Rs. 1,000 or Rs. 1,200.\n\nThere are slate quarries in Badar, Uttar S\u00e1l, Sanor, Choh\u00e1r, Saraj, N\u00e1chan and Pandoh. As all these places are on the higher ranges and in out of the way places, the cost of carriage prevents export and the greater portion of the outturn is consumed locally. The neighbouring cultivators get slates free of charge. B\u00e1kh\u00e1l in Pandoh produces the best slates for roofing purposes. It is at a distance of about 12 miles across the river Be\u00e1s above Mandi, and a mule road was constructed in 1902 to connect the quarry with the capital, the river Be\u00e1s being crossed by a wooden bridge now under construction.\n\nSalt is found in the Ghoghar range and is worked at Guma and Drang. It is quarried in the beds of ravines. The Guma salt is considered purer in quality than that of Drang, but both contain from 25 to 35 per cent. of foreign matter.\n\nFormerly Guma salt found its way as far as Gurdaspur and Dinanagar, and Drang salt as far as Nadaun and Una, but now it is being replaced by the Khewra salt, and its export to British territory is confined to a portion of the P\u00e1lampur and Hamirpur Tahsils and the Kulu Sub-Division of the Kangra District. Drang salt is exported to the surrounding Hill States, Suket, Bilaspur and Bashahr. During the year 1900-01 the quantity of Mandi salt consigned to Native States and exported to British territory amounted to 53,591 and 57,683 mans respectively. The British Government maintained an establishment costing about Rs. 7,000 a year for the supervision of the quarries, but in 1902 they made a considerable reduction. The State expenses come to about Rs. 15,000 a year,\nwhile the State revenue from this source amounts to about Rs. 85,000 a year and the British Government share to about Rs. 33,000. The working expenses amount to about Re. 0-2-6 per man. A light tramway was constructed in 1902 at Guma at a cost of about Rs. 5,000 and small waggons are used to remove the mud and stones and clear the ground. This saves considerable manual labour.\n\nThe officers of the Salt Department are known by certain local names.\n\n(1) D\u00e1ni is the Inspector or Head officer on the mines.\n(2) Dhauri, a miner under whom the labourers work on the mines.\n(3) Bhatungru, who keeps a register of attendance.\n(4) B\u00e1h\u00edl or godami who keeps the tools.\n(5) Batw\u00e1l, one who puts the weights in the scale, when salt is being weighed.\n(6) Jakhw\u00e1hi, who weighs the salt.\n(7) Dhadu, an assistant of the dhauri.\n\nThe protective establishment consists of two Inspectors and a number of peons under the general direction of the Commissioner, N. I. S. R. The apportionment of the duty and the protective arrangements are regulated by the sanad granted to the State in 1846 and by subsequent agreements. A history of these is given in the following extract from the Manual of the N. I. Salt Department, Vol. II, pp. 149-50.\n\nBy sec. 7 of the sanad granted to the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Mandi on the annexation of the Jullundur Do\u00e1b in 1846 provision was made for the regulation of the price of the salt produced within the State. The section runs:\n\n\"In regard to the duties on the iron and salt mines, &c., situated in the territory of Mandi, rules should be laid down, after consultation with the Superintendent of the Hill States, those rules should not be departed from.\"\n\n(2) The price of salt was accordingly fixed at 10 annas a maund in Nov. 1846, and this rate continued in force down to the 31st of Jany. 1871. The R\u00e1j\u00e1 received this revenue.\n\n(3) In 1869-70, it was brought to notice that the quantity of untaxed Mandi salt consumed in British territory was considerable, and to protect the salt revenue of the British Government, the charge made for Mandi salt at the mines was raised to Re. 1-4 a maund with effect from the 1st February 1871, 10 annas being the price of the salt as fixed in 1846, and 10 annas being added as a duty. It was further decided that on all salt consigned to British territory, the duty of 10 annas a maund should be paid to the British Government. An establishment was accordingly posted at the mines on behalf of the British Government to register the destination of the consignments of salt issued; and in accordance with the results recorded the duty realized was divided between the British Government and the R\u00e1j\u00e1.\n\n(4) Some friction between the R\u00e1j\u00e1's officials and the establishment posted at the mines resulted from this arrangement, which was accordingly modified under orders issued by the Government of India in a letter from the Foreign Department, to the Government of the Punjab No. 2654 P., dated\n12th November 1878. By the new arrangement, which was introduced with effect from the 1st May 1880, the duty of 10 annas a maund on all salt sold at the mines, whether consigned to Native States or to British territory, was divided between the British Government and the Raj\u00e1 on the basis of the ascertained consumption of Mandi salt in British territory and in Mandi and other Native States, in the proportion of two-thirds (6 annas 8 pies) to the former and one-third (3 annas 4 pies) to the latter. The Raj\u00e1 continued to receive the full price of 10 annas a maund on all salt sold at the mines.\n\n(5) In consequence of the reduction in the rate of duty on salt levied by the British Government to Rs. 2 a maund, the duty on Mandi salt was reduced from 10 annas to 6 annas a maund with effect from the 1st of April 1884; and under orders issued by the Government of India it was arranged:\n\n(i) that the duty on Mandi salt shall fluctuate with the British duty in the proportion of 1 to 5;\n\n(ii) that the price of Mandi salt, 10 annas a maund, shall not be lowered without the previous sanction of the British Government.\n\nThe total charge on Mandi salt was therefore reduced from Re. 1-4 to one rupee a maund. The distribution of the 6 anna duty was continued in the same proportions, and the British Government received 4 annas and the Raj\u00e1 2 annas a maund on all salt sold.\n\n6. In 1888, the duty on salt in British India was again raised from Rs. 2 to Rs. 2-8 a maund, and on the principle stated in the preceding paragraph, the duty on Mandi salt was raised from 6 annas to 7 annas 6 pies a maund. This rate took effect from the 26th Jany. 1888 at the Guma mine and from the 28th idem at the Drang mine. The duty of 7 annas 6 pies a maund was divided between the British Government and the Raj\u00e1 in the proportion of 5 annas to the former and 2 annas 6 pies to the latter.\n\n7. In Nov. 1889, the Raj\u00e1 was permitted to raise the price of salt at the mines from 10 annas to 10 annas 6 pies a maund. The charge on Mandi salt per maund is now as follows:\n\n| Duty | Rs. a. p. |\n|------|-----------|\n|      | 0 5 0     |\n|      | 0 2 6     |\n\nTotal 0 7 6\n\nPrice 0 10 6\n\nTotal cost 1 2 0\n\nA charge of 3 pies a maund also levied on all salt sold to traders at the mines to cover the cost of transport of the salt from the quarries to the dep\u00f4ts where it is weighed and issued; but this charge does not appear in the accounts. Agriculturists and others removing salt in kilos or headloads are exempt from this charge, but are required to work for one day without remuneration at the mines.\n\nIn February 1900, the Punjab Government proposed that the duty should be divided for ten years between the British Government and the Raj\u00e1 in the proportion of 3:2, as the statistics of the then existing consumption of Mandi salt in British and Native territories showed that three fifths and not two-thirds of the total quantity issued was consumed in British territory; and, in the opinion of the Lieutenant-Governor, the intention of the arrangement of 1878 was that the division of the proceeds of the duty then made should not be final, but should be subject to readjustment in accordance with the consumption of the salt. The so-called price of the salt, however, is to a large extent duty under\nanother name, and the Punjab Government, when recommending the adoption of the system of taking a fixed proportion of the duty in 1878, evidently did not intend that the proportion fixed should be liable to periodical readjustment, as it was proposed to abolish the registration of the destination of consignments. The Government of India therefore decided that the Raja has no equitable claim to revision in his favour of the existing arrangement. By the order of Government received on the 19th March 1903 the salt duty was again reduced from 7 annas 6 pies to 6 annas a maund. This took effect from the 20th March 1903. By this arrangement in force now, the duty of 6 annas is divided between the British Government and the Raja in the proportion of 4 annas to the former and 2 annas to the latter.\n\nSection E.\u2014Arts and Manufactures.\n\nBlacksmiths work in iron and make all the agricultural implements. Some also make ornaments of brass and zinc for the poorer agriculturists. The goldsmiths of Mandi cannot compete in skill with the Sunars of Kangra; but they make ordinary ornaments and earn 8 annas per tola for gold, 6 annas per tola for silver ornaments as wages. The carpenters are generally skilful, and during the summer some of them visit Simla where they earn high wages. In Mandi town, however, they generally earn only 6 annas a day. The carpenters of Chohar make pots of walnut wood. Thathiar or workers in metal are very few in number, but they are skilful and can make all the vessels in ordinary use as well as brass idols for the temples of the local deities, and a curious brass pen-and-ink case made to be carried in the waist band. The Thavis are industrious and some of them do good stone carving and also make idols. The Bhanjiras are an important and industrious class who make many useful articles of bamboo at very low rates. They also make baskets for grain of various sizes, boxes (patars) for keeping clothes, jirdas for screens and manjris for matting; also the killas in which hillmen carry loads on their back. A local proverb shows the esteem in which the bamboo is held for the variety of articles made of it.\n\nKanka re nan venja re vanan idhir kiya vakh\u00e1n.\n\n\"What can be said of the different kinds of bread made of wheat and of the various articles made of bamboo.\" They also make umbrellas of bhoj patr leaves, which are largely used by the poorer classes.\n\nWeaving is another important industry among the hill people. Nearly all the agriculturists of the upper hills make woollen clothes for their own use. Some of the people in Chohar and Sanor are improving in the arts of spinning and weaving wool, and make blankets of superior quality which realize good prices in the markets of Kulu and Mandi. The nilaris are well skilled in the art of dyeing, gay colours of great beauty and variety being much in use. There is a good deal of dyeing in Mandi, as married women never wear clothes which are not of a gay colour.\nFibrous manufactures are not neglected. From the fibre of the wild nettle and cultivated hemp are made ropes, shoes, bags, and nets for fishing and snaring hawks. The bark of the *bihul* tree (*Grewia elasticu*) is used as a fibre for ropes after the stalks have been well soaked in water. Ropes are also made of the *bagar* grass which grows on stony soil.\n\nThere are some Bohra and Khatri women who do needle work and make *pulkaris* or handkerchiefs of silk. They also make very pretty table-cloths which are greatly admired by Europeans.\n\nDistilling liquor affords a livelihood to many persons. The brewing of *lugri* or hill beer and *sur* is also not unknown.\n\n**Section F.\u2014Commerce and Trade.**\n\nThe State is rich in agricultural produce and exports a large quantity of grain. Rice and wheat from Hatli and Suranga are carried on camels to the markets of Hoshiarpur and also to P\u00e1lampur from Bangahal. There is a large trade in potatoes and *rasot* (a yellow powder used for various purposes, e.g. salve for the lips, dyeing, etc.). The former are exported from Choh\u00e1r and the latter from the Ballh District. Other staples of the export trade are tea, salt and *ghi*. Tea amounting to 30,000 to 40,000 lbs. is annually exported to Amritsar, and not less than 300 maunds of *ghi* to the Kangra and Simla Districts. Traders from Simla visit the Gujars at their homes and buy up their produce in small quantities. Spices and medicinal herbs of many kinds are also produced and exported to the plains. Salt is largely exported to the Kangra District and neighbouring Hill States of Bashahr, Suket, N\u00e1lagarh and Bil\u00e1s-pur. *Kar\u00e1his* (or frying pans), *tawas* (iron plates on which bread is baked), made of local iron, are exported to the plains, as they are very strong and durable and much appreciated by the people. The opium made in the State is chiefly kept for local consumption, only a very small quantity finding its way to the Hoshiarpur and Kangra Districts. Honey is largely sent to Hoshiarpur, but it is inferior to that found in Kulu.\n\nTimber is largely carried down by the Be\u00e1s and Sutlej rivers, and is collected at Waz\u00edr Bhular and Doraha for sale. As the forests have been worked by contractors for some years past all the timber belongs to them, the State receiving a royalty before the timber is floated into a stream. Hides, wool, hawks and musk are also exported to the plains.\n\nThe chief imports from the plains are English-made piece-goods, household vessels of brass, copper and other metals from Delhi, Amritsar and Jullundur. Gold and silver from the Amritsar market, sugar and oils from Hoshiarpur, also country-made coarse cloth from Garhshankar in the Hoshiarpur District are largely imported. Salt from Khewra has been replacing the local sal\nand about 5,000 maunds are now imported annually into Mandi territory.\n\nThousands of mules on their way from Hoshiarpur to Yarkand and Ladakh pass through the town of Mandi. They carry tobacco, tea, sugar, coarse cloth and English-made piece-goods to Yarkand and on their return bring coarse woollen cloth and carpets, chavas and spices from Yarkand.\n\nSection G.\u2014Means of Communication.\n\nMandi suffers from the want of easy and quick communication with the railway. It may be reached from the plains by the following routes:\n\n1. Kangra-Palampur Road.\n2. Jullundur-Hoshiarpur Road.\n3. Simla-Suket Road.\n4. Doraha-Rupar Road.\n\nRoute No. (1) Kangra-Palampur Road.\n\nBy route No. (1) Mandi is 131 miles from Pathankot, 81 from Kangra and 77\u00bd from Dharamsala. Ekkas run from Palampur to Baijnath whence traffic is by mules, ponies or camels. The following are the stages on this line:\n\n1. From Palampur to Baijnath, 11 miles ... A very ancient temple of Shiva, dak bungalow, serai, encamping ground, post and telegraph office; water plentiful, a small bazaar for the supply of provisions.\n\n2. Baijnath to Dhelu, 12 miles ... A dak bungalow, serai and encamping ground, road very good, water plentiful in the rains but scarce in summer, supplies and coolies procurable after due notice. Two miles up from Baijnath at the top of the Ghata, is the Mandi border; 5 miles further on is the Sukha Bagh plantation, then the Baigar stream is crossed and the road ascends up to the bungalow on the left hand side. Although a little higher than Baijnath temperature is the same as at Baijnath.\n\n3. Dhelu to Urla, 14 miles ... Half a mile from Dhelu the Gugli stream is crossed by a bridge, then the road ascends to Haras Bagh, a distance of about 6 miles, and 3 miles further on arrives at the tinna salt mines. Thence it ascends for 3 miles and finally descends to Urla 2 miles further on. Dak bungalow, serai and encamping ground, water plentiful.\n\n4. From Urla to Drang, 12 miles ... Good riding road, dak bungalow, serai and encamping ground, water sufficient.\n\n5. From Drang to Mandi, 11 miles ... After an ascent of 5 miles the road descends 6 miles to Mandi, crossing the Beas by the iron suspension bridge, large bazaar, dak bungalow, serai and encamping ground, water plentiful.\nThe Baijnath-Mandi Road was constructed in 1887 at a cost of a lakh of rupees. It is 47 miles in length from Baijnath Ghatta on the Mandi border. Its average slope varies from 7 to 10 in every 100 feet and it is from 10 to 12 feet in breadth. The road is being widened to 16 feet and up to Dhelu, 12 miles from Baijnath, it is now open for bullock carts.\n\nTravellers from Palampur to Kulu leave this road near Guma and ascend the hill on the left 4 miles up to Jhatingri. Badwani is 12\u00bd miles from Jhatingri. The Ul is crossed by a bridge 3 miles below Jhatingri. From Badwani the road crosses the Bhabhu Pass 9,480 feet to Karaon, 10 miles in Kulu, thence the road runs down the Sarwari valley to Sultanpur (8 miles). This road is covered with snow during the winter and remains closed from December to February or March, so travellers have to proceed to Kulu by the lower road from Drang, the 4th stage on the main road from Baijnath.\n\nDrang to Kataula, 16 miles\nKataula to Kandi, 9 miles\nKandi to Bajaura, 9 miles\nBajaura to Sultanpur, 9 miles\n\nThere are dak bungalows and serais at each stage, and provisions and coolies are supplied on due notice being given. A week's clear notice is required for Jhatingri and Badwani.\n\nRoute No. (2) Jullundur-Hoshiarpur Road.\n\nThis is the shortest route from any station on the North-Western Railway to Mandi. There is much mule and camel traffic on it, hundreds of mules passing through Mandi by it to Ladakh and Yarkand. It is not, however, liked by European travellers, as it is rather hot during the summer. Rest-houses have not been built at all the stages and servants are not kept at the rest-houses already built.\n\nJullundur to Hoshiarpur, 25 miles\nHoshiarpur to Una stages, 27 miles\nUna to Barsar in the Kangra District, 20 miles\nBarsar to Aghar, 14 miles\nAghar to Bhamla (in Mandi) 14 miles\nBhamla to Galma Devi, 13 miles\nGalma to Mandi, 11 miles\n\nThis road from the Sher Khad stream 2 miles below Bhamla is 27 miles from the town of Mandi. It was built in 1882 at a cost of Rs. 50,000. Its average slope is 10 to 12 in 100 and its breadth 8 or 9 feet. It is kept in thorough repair and is open for camel traffic.\n\nRoute No. (3) Simla-Suket Road.\n\nThis road is 96 miles long and the following are the stages on it:\n\nSimla to Bhajji, 24 miles\nBhajji to Alsindi (in Suket), 12 miles\nAlsindi to Chindi (in Suket), 9 miles\nChindi to Jhungi (in Mandi), 11 miles\nJhungi to Ghiri (in Suket), 12 miles\nGhiri to Bhojpur, 13 miles\nBhojpur to Mandi, 15 miles\n\nCross the Sutlej river by the bridge at Tattapani, near Bhajji.\n\nThere are rest-houses but servants are not kept, supplies and coolies are procurable after due notice.\n\nRoute No. (4) Doraha-Rupar Road.\n\nThe road is 106 miles from Mandi and pilgrims to Hardwar, Benares, and Gya travel by it. It is a bad road with no dak bungalows and no rest-houses. Travellers have to go by boat from Doraha to Rupar via the Sirhind Canal and cross the Sutlej by boat at Dihar between Bilaspur and Suket.\n\n(1) In 1904 it was closed till May, and in 1905 until the middle of June.\nMandi State.] Economic. [Part A.\n\nFrom Doraha Station on the North-Western Railway to Rupar by boat, 36 miles.\n\n| Miles | Miles |\n|-------|-------|\n| Rupar by boat | 38 |\n| Rupar to Kala Kund | 21 |\n| Kala Kund to Bilaspur | 15 |\n| Bilaspur to Dihar | 9 |\n| Dihar to Suket | 9 |\n| Suket to Mandi | 16 |\n| Total | 106 |\n\nAt Sandhol communication by ferry boat is suspended in the rainy season and travellers cross the river on darais or inflated skins. Between Mandi town and Sandhol there are also crossings where darais are used at Kun-ka-tar Kanda, &c.\n\nSection H.\u2014Famine.\n\nThe rainfall is usually sufficient. Sometimes however the low hills suffer either from a long break in the rains or from excessive rainfall.\n\nUntil 1893 the state seems to have been very prosperous. The Rabi of 1893 failed badly on account of drought, and cattle disease broke out. Next year (1894) there was too much rain. The produce of 1895 was below the average. The spring crop of 1896 was poor. The next monsoon failed and there was danger of famine. Takavi advances were given freely and relief works started. The Larji Bharwah road was constructed at this time as a relief work. Since then the crops have been uniformly good. It will be seen therefore that, generally speaking, the state is practically safe from famine; certainly from severe and general famine.\nCHAPTER III.\u2014ADMINISTRATIVE.\n\nSection A.\u2014General Administration and Administrative Division.\n\nThe State is divided into 4 Tahsils\u2014further sub-divided into 24 waziris, viz.\u2014\n\n| Tahsil | Waziri | Number of villages | Population (1901) | Revenue |\n|--------|--------|-------------------|------------------|---------|\n|        |        |                   |                  | Rs.     |\n| NAGAR MANDI | Mandi (proper) | 4 | 8,144 | 14,088 |\n|        | Ballhgarh | 3 | 4,360 | 14,088 |\n|        | Balbh Channtra | 6 | 5,641 | 8,250 |\n|        | H\u00e1tgarh | 4 | 5,940 | 11,514 |\n|        | Baira | 4 | 5,211 | 9,411 |\n|        | Bagra | 5 | 5,720 | 5,893 |\n|        | Pichhit | 4 | 4,618 | 3,764 |\n|        | Tungal | 7 | 5,589 | 2,754 |\n|        | Total | 37 | 45,103 | 55,674 |\n\n| Tahsil | Waziri | Number of villages | Population (1901) | Revenue |\n|--------|--------|-------------------|------------------|---------|\n|        | Hatl\u00ed | 8 | 8,706 | 51,959 |\n|        | Anantpur | 12 | 20,466 | 29,296 |\n|        | Kam\u00edlab | 12 | 13,985 | 19,588 |\n|        | Total | 32 | 43,157 | 64,843 |\n\n| Tahsil | Waziri | Number of villages | Population (1901) | Revenue |\n|--------|--------|-------------------|------------------|---------|\n|        | Lad | 5 | 7,679 | 9,651 |\n|        | Bhang\u00e1l | 6 | 7,971 | 12,887 |\n|        | Ner | 11 | 10,403 | 14,838 |\n|        | Chuh\u00e1r | 6 | 5,240 | 6,581 |\n|        | Gumma | 2 | 1,820 | 2,241 |\n|        | Drangseira | 5 | 5,999 | 5,007 |\n|        | Jittars\u00e1l | 2 | 1,890 | 1,979 |\n|        | Badk\u00e9 | 3 | 2,146 | 2,595 |\n|        | Sanor | 5 | 6,053 | 5,157 |\n|        | Naraingarh | 2 | 1,427 | 1,189 |\n|        | Total | 47 | 50,698 | 62,075 |\n\n| Tahsil | Waziri | Number of villages | Population (1901) | Revenue |\n|--------|--------|-------------------|------------------|---------|\n|        | Grand Total | 1,150 | 174,045 | 222,082 |\n\nThe above division into Tahsils is for revenue work only, the whole of the judicial work of the State being carried on at headquarters by the following staff:\n\n- Tahsild\u00e1r: 1\n- Q\u00e1n\u00edngos: 2\n- Amins: 6\n- Clerks: 11\n- Chapr\u00e1sis: 14\n\nRecently 2 Tahsildars have been appointed, their circles being respectively (1) Balh, Hatli, Gop\u00e1lpur, Sandhol thanas, (2), Drang Chachot, Kande Sar\u00faj, Har\u00e1b\u00e1gh thanas. No alteration has been made in their judicial powers.\n\nIn former times each waziri was administered by a waz\u00edr under the chief waz\u00edr of Chauntra, so called from the chauntra or court of justice at the capital where he held his court and in which he is still regularly installed. In the time of the Sikhs however the waz\u00edrs were replaced by k\u00e1rd\u00e1rs, or, as they were called locally, p\u00e1lsr\u00e1ds or neg\u00eds. The waz\u00edrs had full powers in all cases relating to land: they could authorize the breaking up of waste, effect partition, assess fluctuating revenue, arrest cultivators who failed to pay their revenue punctually, attach their crops and inflict minor...\ncorporal punishment. They collected the grazing and all other dues. Each k\u00e1rd\u00e1r had a k\u00e1yath, or accountant, under him to keep his accounts, and a pinjoli or mehar in each garh. The waziri was divided into several garhs or mehar\u00e1s. The garh or fort itself was the head-quarters of the meh\u00e1rdi and was selected as a safe stronghold for the storage of the revenue collected in cash or kind. Each garh was again sub-divided into several gr\u00e1ons or b\u00edsis which resembled the tikas in Kangra, and which were hamlets or groups of huts with their adjacent fields. The boundaries of the gr\u00e1ons were vague and ill-defined until the Settlement of 1870, when they were clearly demarcated and kishtw\u00e1r maps prepared for the more populous tracts. At this Settlement all the powers above described were withdrawn from the k\u00e1rd\u00e1rs, and since then they have only been responsible for the collection of the revenue and the keeping of the accounts. It is also their duty to allot the beg\u00e1r, sending a fixed number of men to the capital for service by turns. In these duties they are assisted by the pinjol\u00eds and meha-s, and have also a certain number of piy\u00e1l\u00e1s, jett\u00e1s or gur\u00e1kh\u00e1s. There are also lambars whose duty it is to act as watchmen and assist the police in criminal cases.\n\nThe R\u00e1j\u00e1 is assisted in the general administration by the Waz\u00edr, who exercises the highest powers, both executive and judicial.\n\nHis duties are varied and onerous, but his judicial responsibility is considerably lessened by the fact that every appeal which he decides can be taken, on further appeal or revision, to the R\u00e1j\u00e1's court even if the Waz\u00edr has confirmed the sentence of the original court.\n\nThe administration of the Land Revenue system is supervised by the Waz\u00edr, and his principal subordinate is the Tahs\u00edld\u00e1r, who besides his judicial functions is also a revenue officer. In the latter capacity the Tahs\u00edld\u00e1r is assisted by a k\u00e1n\u00edngo and 25 patw\u00e1r\u00eds or k\u00e1yaths. Appeals from the Tahs\u00edld\u00e1r's decisions on revenue matters go to the Waz\u00edr.\n\nSection B.\u2014Civil and Criminal Justice.\n\nThe Mandi Darb\u00e1r has adopted the Indian Penal Code in its entirety, with the exception of the section (70) relating to punishments. This has been modified in the following particulars:\n\n(i). As transportation cannot be inflicted, rigorous imprisonment for a term of 10 years or for life is substituted for it.\n\n(ii). Solitary confinement is not inflicted.\n\nAs regards procedure the Criminal Procedure Code is followed in its main principles but with considerable modifications in detail. Every offence is cognisable by the police, and on receiving informa-\ntion of an offence the police ch\u00e1l\u00e1n the case direct to the Waz\u00edr's court. In cases of cattle-trespass the th\u00e1na\u1e0d\u00e1r has power under an old law to inflict a fine commensurate with the damage done, but he must then report the matter to the Waz\u00edr. Minor cases of offences against the person or property are transferred by the Waz\u00edr to the Tahs\u00edld\u00e1r, who can impose a fine up to Rs. 25 and imprisonment up to one month. Assessors are not appointed in Sessions cases, which are always tried by the Waz\u00edr. Sentences of death need the confirmation of the R\u00e1j\u00e1, and are not carried out until the sanction of the Commissioner has been received. No appeal lies from a sentence of one month's imprisonment or Rs. 10 fine inflicted by the Tahs\u00edld\u00e1r, but any heavier sentence is appealable to the Waz\u00edr's court, whence a further appeal lies in every case to the R\u00e1j\u00e1.\n\nThe lowest civil court is that of the Tahs\u00edld\u00e1r who hears cases up to Rs. 100 in value, and suits for cultivating rights. A bench of four or five munsiy\u00e1s has power to hear cases up to Rs. 200. Appeals from the decisions of both these courts lie to the Waz\u00edr. The Waz\u00edr hears all other cases, and an appeal lies to the R\u00e1j\u00e1's court in all cases.\n\nLand suits are most common. They are decided in accordance with the ancient custom of the State. The body of tribal laws and customs has never been codified.\n\nThere are no definite rules relating to pre-emption.\n\nThe following rules of limitation are in force:\n\n| Claims for title in land | ... | ... | ... | 20 |\n|-------------------------|-----|-----|-----|----|\n| Claims based on bonds   | ... | ... | ... | 20 |\n| Claims based on book accounts | ... | ... | ... | 12 |\n| Claims based on verbal agreement | ... | ... | ... | 3 |\n| Applications for execution of decrees must be made within | ... | ... | ... | 12 |\n\nThe law of divorce is curious. A man may divorce his wife provided she is willing. A woman may claim a divorce from her husband when he is willing to part with her, provided some other man is willing to marry her, and to pay the expenses her first husband incurred at her marriage.\n\nThe Registration Act is not in force. The only documents which require to be registered are those relating to the transfer of property (without limit of value) and marriage contracts, i.e., contracts transferring a woman from one husband to another. The re-marriage of a widow who has no legal guardian must also be registered on the husband's application and no such marriage is legal unless so registered. Registration of betrothals was once enforced, but is so no longer. Documents are registered in the Waz\u00edr's court.\nSection C.\u2014Land Revenue.\n\nThe R\u00e1j\u00e1 is sole proprietor of all the land in the State and land-holders have no right to mortgage or sell their lands. However, to satisfy a decree passed in favour of a banker, a man can of his own free will give up possession of the produce of his fields for a limited period not exceeding 15 years, after the lapse of which period the land is resumable by the tenant. Many Koli zamind\u00e1rs of Ballh, Hatli, R\u00e1jgarh, H\u00e1tgarh, have effected transfers of land under the above conditions. A tenant who owed arrears of revenue and had not property to pay off the demand, might formally alienate his lands to a banker who paid off the arrears with the consent of the Darb\u00e1r, but now the rules have been revised, and such transfers are only allowed for a limited number of years.\n\nPersons who hold leases of lands from the Darb\u00e1r are called m\u00e1lguz\u00e1rs. Lands are assigned to them by a written lease, called s\u00e1ntha, granted by the R\u00e1j\u00e1, and in this are set forth the name of the lessee, the village and waz\u00edr\u012b he belongs to, the extent of his fields and amount of rent due thereon, with the condition 'zam\u00edn badh\u00e1ti badh\u00e1ni' which means that the revenue will increase as the cultivated area increases, at a fixed rate. The details of the beg\u00e1r or corv\u00e9e is also given, or if it is remitted, cash, in lieu thereof, is realized. This is called bith\u00e1ngna.\n\nLeases have been thus granted to the following persons:\n\n(1). M\u00e1lguz\u00e1rs, as mentioned above.\n\n(2). J\u00e1gird\u00e1rs, who are relatives of the R\u00e1j\u00e1 and hold lands for their maintenance.\n\nEach member of the ruling family receives a separate allotment of greater or less extent, according to the degree of his relationship to the Chief or to his influence in the State.\n\n(3). Mu\u00e1fidd\u00e1rs, to whom grants are made for services in time of war or peace. Such special services are rewarded by in\u00e1m or b\u00e1si grants.\n\n(4). Rozg\u00e1r land-holders: These are chiefly the R\u00e1j\u00e1's attendants and private servants, soldiers of the Body-guard, Tahsil and Th\u00e1ma peons, Guards of forts, servants attached to the kitchen or rasoi are also included.\n\n(5). L\u00e1rh\u00ed-B\u00e1si lands are granted to artisans and menials for services done to the State. Loh\u00e1rs, Kumh\u00e1rs, N\u00e1\u00eds and Thh\u00e1w\u00edns fall under this head. These men hold lands for service only.\n\n(6). S\u00e1san lands are given to Brahmins, or religious priests, for the performance of religious duties. The power of alienation of s\u00e1san lands to other Brahmins is recognised.\nThe Rabi crop is called *niy\u0101h* and its revenue is realized in two instalments, one in Ah\u0101r and the other in Bh\u0101don, while that of the *s\u0101yar* or Kharif is similarly realized in Pos and Ph\u0101gan. When the crop is ready and the corn has been reaped, the amount of seed is deducted from the produce. It goes to the *m\u0101lguz\u0101r* if he gave seed to his tenants at the time of ploughing, otherwise it falls to the tenant's share. Half the produce then goes to the *m\u0101lguz\u0101r* and half to the tenant who cultivated the land. Of the village menials only Loh\u0101rs receive a small fraction of the wheat or rice. The great mass of the agriculturists, owing to the small size of their holdings, do not employ hired field labour, but some of the wealthier ones employ village menials at harvest and also such poor agriculturists as have no land of their own. These men get a share of what is reaped or in some places food only. At the time of reaping the crop, the *m\u0101lguz\u0101r* employs a *besku* or guard to keep watch on the harvested crop and the *besku* is entitled to receive from the *m\u0101lguz\u0101r* 2 *pathas* or 8 *sers kuchcha* of wheat or rice. Ploughing is done by the tenant's (if any) of the *m\u0101lguz\u0101r* who are also bound to repair the irrigating channels.\n\nThe trees standing on the cultivated lands are felled by the *m\u0101lguz\u0101r* and the tenant with each other's permission. A tenant has free use of timber trees required for building his huts or for ploughing purposes.\n\nIn a very few instances a *m\u0101lguz\u0101r* receives one-third of the produce. Examples of this are met with in the Suranga and Pichh\u016bt *waz\u012bris* only.\n\nA *m\u0101lguz\u0101r* is only evicted from his land in the following cases:\n\n1. For default of punctual payment of revenue.\n2. For breach of loyalty and fidelity to the ruling prince.\n3. On refusal to pay additional revenue on the increased area of his land if an increase in the cultivated area is proved by measurement of the land.\n\nNo *m\u0101lguz\u0101r* has a right to alienate any portion of the land he holds and a tenant has no right to claim a *m\u0101lguz\u0101r*'s land during his lifetime or in the presence of his collateral male issue. No tenant can be evicted from the land he has been cultivating without the order of the R\u0101ja. An order for the ejectment of a tenant can only be granted in the following cases:\n\n1. If a tenant knowingly neglects his cultivation to the injury of the *m\u0101lguz\u0101r*.\n2. If he takes away harvested crops in the absence of the *m\u0101lguz\u0101r*.\n\nThe widow of a tenant retains possession on the death of her husband, and is allowed to have the lands cultivated by his male\ncollaterals, or, in the absence of such collaterals, by any tenant she chooses.\n\nDeod\u00e1r, kail, mango, sh\u00edsham, and toon trees cannot be felled without the permission of the Darb\u00e1r, even though they be standing on the cultivated area of the petitioner.\n\nIt depends on the pleasure of the R\u00e1ja to bestow j\u00e1g\u00edr lands on his relatives for their maintenance. Such lands usually are given according to the degree of relationship. These j\u00e1g\u00edr lands are always granted for the life of the j\u00e1g\u00edrd\u00e1r, and are resumed or reduced, as the case may be, by the State on his death. Some j\u00e1g\u00edrd\u00e1rs receive grain, others cash from their tenants; they are bound by the customs of the holdings granted to them, and have no power to make any change in them. They also exact labour from their tenants according to their requirements, but in no case may the amount exacted exceed the rate of labour fixed by the State. The tenants of a j\u00e1g\u00edrd\u00e1r are, as a rule, exempted from doing beg\u00e1r service to the State, but the State has reserved certain rights of beg\u00e1r even in j\u00e1g\u00edr lands. Labour is required from them as the occasion of a marriage in the R\u00e1ja\u2019s family: also on the R\u00e1ja\u2019s tours, and they must carry loads on the occasion of the Political Agent\u2019s or Lieutenant-Governor\u2019s tour within the territory of the State. They are liable for the carrying of game for the R\u00e1ja\u2019s kitchen, and for carrying supplies of snow. J\u00e1g\u00edrd\u00e1rs are entitled to all the dues which are received by the State except the hary\u00e1ng cess. Mu\u00e1f\u00eddd\u00e1rs and s\u00e1sand\u00e1rs also have the same rights on the lands they hold unless special conditions are made with them contrary to the established customs. A j\u00e1g\u00edrd\u00e1r receives revenue from his tenants while a mu\u00e1f\u00eddd\u00e1r gets rent.\n\n| Principal J\u00e1g\u00edrd\u00e1rs. | Income. | S\u00e1san Lands. | Income. |\n|----------------------|---------|--------------|---------|\n| Mi\u00e1n Mohan Singh     | 1,000   | Devi Rupeshri | 200     |\n| Ganga Singh          | 720     | Mah\u00e1deo Tirlok N\u00e1th | 120     |\n| Kishan Singh         | 750     | Balj N\u00e1th    | 200     |\n| Kahn Singh           | 150     | Parasar      | 160     |\n| Dh\u00e1n\u00fa                | 160     | Sri M\u00e1dho R\u00e1o | 200     |\n| Day\u00e1l Singh          | 160     | Parohit Bajreshri Datt | 1,000   |\n| S\u00e1wan Singh          | 160     | Devi R\u00e1ma\u2019s wife | 1,000   |\n| Bhima                | 225     |               |         |\n| Padha Gauri Datt     | 175     |               |         |\n| Taranga R\u00e1i          | 125     |               |         |\n| P.

Soils are distinguished by local names, such as\u2014\n\n(1). A small piece of land on the bank of a stream which, though unirrigated, gets moisture and yields rice, tobacco and sugarcane, is called *k\u00e1tal*.\n\n(2). Fields free from stones lying in a level space are called *ballh* lands. The soil is rich and yields all kinds of grain, but suffers if there is deficient rainfall in the monsoon.\n\n(3). Patches of land made by terracing the hillsides are usually called *gh\u00e1d* lands. They are also known by the names...\nof *gaihri* or *gaihri*. These are unirrigated and when rain falls, produce maize, rice, *mandal* and *sonk*.\n\n(4). Fields made by breaking up steep hillsides, where ploughing is impossible on account of the slope, are called *kutlis*. Instead of being ploughed, these lands are broken up with the spade and wheat only sown in Bh\u00e1don.\n\n(5). Lands on the ridges of hills which are too high to bear any Rabi crop but wheat, and are under very heavy snow in winter are called *bhray\u00e1\u00ed* or *sard\u00ed* lands. The crop ripens in May and June, sowing having taken place in August and September.\n\n(6). Lands on which huts are built are called *su\u00e1r\u00fa basi*. Such lands are granted on a *nazar\u00e1na* and are not liable to revenue.\n\n(7). Lands close to dwellings and on which vegetables are generally cultivated are called *su\u00e1r\u00fa*.\n\n(8). Lands made culturable by pulling down houses are called *gharw\u00e1n*.\n\n(9). Waste land on hillsides leading to a stream or forming a path for cattle to a stream is called *gohar*.\n\n---\n\n**Section D.\u2014Miscellaneous Revenue.**\n\nCountry spirit is made from *gur*, mixed with the bark of the *b\u00e9r* tree softened in water. The decoction is placed in earthenware pitchers and surrounded with horse dung. Thus it remains for about a week, by which time fermentation has started. The liquor is then transferred to metal pots which are put on the fire, the spirit being extracted by distillation in the ordinary way. An annual auction is held of the right to distil and sell country spirit throughout the State. The income thus realized averages Rs. 12,500.\n\nThe successful bidder sub-lets his rights to sub-contractors called Kakned\u00e1rs, but he alone is responsible to the State for the auction money.\n\nThere are some 83 liquor shops in the State.\n\nThe poppy is grown in Sanor, Chahar and Sar\u00e1j. Opium is prepared in small quantities for home consumption and for sale.\n\nAll opium imported has to pass through the customs house at Mandi where it pays duty.\n\nAll opium exported pays a duty of 9 annas per seer.\n\nThe license to sell *charas* is sold by auction annually. The contractor sub-lets the right to sell at recognised shops, and has the sole right of importing *charas*, which is obtained from Hoshiarpur.\nVarious other contracts are also sold by auction, e.g., bridge-tolls, the collection of hides and skins, the collection of the State dues on account of sugarcane and tobacco cultivation, leases of certain grazing grounds, &c.\n\nAfter the contracts are sanctioned the contractors are formally invested with pagris and each present Re. 1 to the State.\n\nThe average amount nominally realised by the State in contracts comes to Rs. 40,000 annually.\n\nCourt-fee stamps are manufactured in the Mandi jail and before issue are signed by the Wazir. Their values are As. 2, 4 and 8 and Rs. 1, 2, &c., up to Rs. 25. Three petition-writers are licensed to sell them, and stamps can only be obtained from them at the sadr bazar. Neither the Stamp Act nor the Court Fees Act is in force. In all Civil suits up to Rs. 100 in value a fee of one anna on the rupee is levied. Above Rs. 100 half that only is charged. Stamps of the necessary value are attached to the plaint. No fee is charged for process-serving. The same stamps may be used for agreements, &c., but the people rarely use stamped agreements.\n\nSellers of stamps are bound to keep a list showing the names of the purchasers and this operates as a quasi registration.\n\nSection E.\u2014Police and Jail.\n\nAn Inspector of Police, 8 Deputy Inspectors or Th\u00e1nad\u00e1rs and 137 constables are entertained.\n\nThe Th\u00e1n\u00e1s or police stations are at Har\u00e1b\u00e1gh, Dr\u00e1ng, Sar\u00e1j, Chachot, Ballh, Hatli, Gop\u00e1lpur, and Sandhol. Lockups and a cattle-pound are attached to each Th\u00e1na.\n\nThere are Lambars or Lambard\u00e1rs in each Garh, who report criminal offences to the Th\u00e1nad\u00e1rs and act as chowkidars in each village.\n\nThe people are generally peaceful and law-abiding and serious crime is of rare occurrence. Petty cases of theft are frequent and cases of adultery and kidnapping not uncommon.\n\nThe Bang\u00e1l\u00eds are the only criminal tribe. They number 93. They mostly live by begging, but a few cultivate land as tenants.\n\nThe Ballh people are given to excessive drinking and quarrels often resulting in hurt are very common.\n\nThe Chuh\u00e1r people on the Kulu road are addicted to petty thefts. They often take sheep and goats which stray from the flocks passing along that road during the summer and winter migrations.\n\nThe Th\u00e1nad\u00e1rs as already mentioned are empowered to inflict fines in cases of cattle-trespass.\nThe Mandi Jail contains accommodation for 50 prisoners. Paper-making and lithographing are the chief occupations of the prisoners.\n\nSection F.\u2014Education.\n\nThere are 12 schools in the State including an Anglo-Vernacular Middle School at Mandi.\n\nEducation is very backward, only Khatris and Brahmins and a few Rajputs take an interest in the subject.\n\nThe School at Mandi is efficiently staffed and is popular in the town.\n\nSection G.\u2014Medical.\n\nThe King Edward VII Hospital at Mandi, which has recently been completed, is a spacious building standing on the side of a hill just outside the town. Lala Thakar Das, an experienced Assistant Surgeon, is in charge.\n\nSome 10,000 to 15,000 patients are treated annually. There are numerous hakims, the most prominent of whom is Vaid Vidya Saggar who acted as a sort of Court physician to the late Raja.\nCHAPTER IV.\u2014PLACES OF INTEREST.\n\nMANDI TOWN.\n\nMandi town (31\u00b0 45' North, 76\u00b0 58' East) picturesquely situated on the Be\u00e1s River, is the capital of the State. The town itself is 2,557 feet above sea-level; the Shi\u00e1ma K\u00e1l\u00ed temple on a near ridge, which commands the town, is 500 feet higher.\n\nThe Be\u00e1s separates the old town from the new one and is spanned by a handsome iron bridge (the Empress bridge) which was opened for traffic in 1877.\n\nApproaching Mandi from the Baijn\u00e1th side the Residency, known as S\u00far\u00e1 Koth\u00ed, is conspicuous for a great distance.\n\nThe chief baz\u00e1r, which is square in shape, is known as Chauhatta, to the north of it is the Customs House. To the west and overlooking the baz\u00e1r is a large double-storeyed house known as the Chauntra. Here the Wazir used to hold his Court and here a newly appointed Waz\u00edr is installed. The Kotwal also uses it as an office. At festivals Darbars are held in it.\n\nClose at hand is the palace which has received additions at various times.\n\nThe oldest part is known as Damdama and was built by R\u00e1ja Suraj Sen in 1625. In this building are the Toshakhana, the Silahkhana and the M\u00e1dh\u00f3 Rao temple.\n\nThe officials of the Toshakhana look after the State jewels, valuables, and robes. In the picture room are illuminated manuscripts of considerable interest and value.\n\nThe Silahkhana is the armoury. There is a large collection of guns, swords, daggers and shields. The new portion of the palace called the N\u00e1wa Mahal, was built by the father of the present R\u00e1ja. In it is the great Darbar Hall.\n\nIn front of the palace is a large tank with a stone pillar in the middle.\n\nPirthi Pal, R\u00e1na of Bhang\u00e1hal, was invited to Mandi by his son-in-law R\u00e1ja Sidh Sen and treacherously murdered.\n\nThe unfortunate R\u00e1na's head is said to have been buried under the pillar.\n\nAt the south corner of the tank is the R\u00e1ja's stable which has accommodation for 100 horses.\n\nBeyond and near to the Suket road is the royal cemetery in which are to be found the monuments of the ruling family. There is but little doubt that 'Sati' was practised here in olden times by the R\u00e1n\u00eds. Further on is an excellent swinging bridge crossing the Suketi Khad and called after Sir Dennis Fitzpatrick.\nThe D\u00e2k Bungalow, the Residency and the New Hospital are close together near the Sukodh\u00ed stream.\n\nOn the left bank of the Sukodh\u00ed is a famous temple of Ganpati built by R\u00e1ja Sidh Sen, in which is a life-size image of that R\u00e1ja.\n\nThe town of Mandi is 131 miles from Path\u00e1nkot, 81 miles from Kangra, 124 from Jullundur, 106 from Dor\u00e1h\u00e1 and about 88 from Simla.\n\nIt contains a population of 8,144 souls according to the Census of 1901, 7,528 being Hind\u00fas, 591 Musalmans and 25 Sikhs. It is a busy trade centre, being on the main route from Y\u00e1rkand and Lad\u00e1kh to Hoshi\u00e1rpur and the plains. Trade is chiefly in the hands of Khatr\u00ed\u00eds. The streets are paved with stone and are kept very clean. Being shut in between two comparatively high ranges of hills, the heat is somewhat oppressive in summer. The place is damp and unhealthy, consumption being very common.\n\nKaml\u00e1h.\n\nThe Fort of Kaml\u00e1h is on the Ham\u00edrpur border, built in A.D. 1625 by R\u00e1ja Suraj Sen of Mandi on the crest of a precipitous and isolated hill. It was long considered impregnable, though modern artillery would make short work of it. For many years Kaml\u00e1h resisted invaders from the south-west, and later on it served as a refuge for fugitive Mandi princes. General Ventura captured it in 1840 and the Sikhs garrisoned it for some years until the last Sikh War diverted their energies and gave the Mandi R\u00e1ja a chance of driving them out. The garrison at present consists of a commandant and 25 men, with six unserviceable guns.\n\nFrom the reign of Suraj Sen down to that of Surma Sen all the wealth of the State was accumulated in this fort. A large quantity of grain is still stored here. The neighbouring tenants can borrow grain from this fort repaying with interest at 25 per cent.\n\nBa\u00edrkot.\n\nThe fort of Ba\u00edrkot in Mandi was built by Bir Singh, R\u00e1ja of Suket, who conquered the R\u00e1na of Hatli in order to defend the Ham\u00edrpur border. The Mandi R\u00e1j\u00e1s did not approve of this advance on the part of Suket, and made several attempts to wrest the fort from that State. Isri Sen, R\u00e1ja of Mandi, with the help of Kahl\u00far took it in 1808. It is still in good repair and used as a State granary.\n\nM\u00e1dhopur.\n\nThe fort of M\u00e1dhopur now in Mandi Sar\u00e1j was captured by Mandi in 1688 from a tributary of Suket. This period marks the highest pitch of prosperity that Mandi ever reached.\nKLIPEER.\n\nA fort in Mandi captured by that State in 1688, with that of M\u00e9dhopur.\n\nSHARFUR.\n\nThis fort is situated on a spur between the R\u00e1n\u00e1 and Binn\u00fa streams, about \u00be miles south-east of Baijn\u00e1th and \u00bd mile south-west of Aij\u00fa village near the road from Baijn\u00e1th to Mandi. It is 4,885 feet above the sea. It belonged to the R\u00e1n\u00e1 of Bhang\u00e1l and passed into the hands of R\u00e1ja M\u00e1n Singh of Kulu in 1534 A.D. It did not long remain a part of Kulu territory and was finally annexed by Mandi in the time of R\u00e1ja Sidh Sen who murdered P\u00edrth\u00ed P\u00e1l, the last R\u00e1n\u00e1 of Bhang\u00e1l. It is still kept in good order and used as a State granary.\n\nBAIRA.\n\nThis is a small fort on the summit of a hill 3,470 feet above the sea about 2 miles up the Sh\u00edr khad stream on the Ham\u00edr-pur-Mandi road.\n\nIt was under the rule of R\u00e1n\u00e1 of Hatl\u00ed and was captured by R\u00e1ja B\u00eer Sen of Suket. R\u00e1ja Gur Sen of Mandi with the help of the R\u00e1ja of Kahl\u00far took the fort in 1676 from Suket. R\u00e1ja Sansar Chand of Kangra having conquered Hatl\u00ed Il\u00e1k\u00e1 handed it over to Suket, but R\u00e1ja Isri Sen re-captured Hatl\u00ed and took the Baira fort in 1808.\n\nIt is still used as a State granary.\n\nGUMA.\n\nGuma situated on the range of hills known Ghoghar k\u00ed dh\u00e1r is celebrated for its salt quarries. Salt has been worked here for centuries and a very large quantity of it is every year exported to the Kangra district. Guma is 29 miles north-west of Mandi on the Mandi-Baijn\u00e1th road and is about 5,112 feet above the sea. It was once a separate State under the rule of a R\u00e1n\u00e1 and was conquered by R\u00e1ja Madan Sen of Suket about 1400 A.D. Later it seems to have fallen into the hands of R\u00e1ja Laskari and was annexed to Mandi by R\u00e1ja Narayan Sen. In the time of R\u00e1ja Suraj Sen, it was captured by the R\u00e1ja of Kulu and recaptured by R\u00e1ja Sidh Sen of Mandi.\n\nPAR\u00c1SAR.\n\nPar\u00e1sar is about 20 miles north-east of Mandi. It is a large lake with a wooden temple on its edge. A large fair takes place here in June when Mandi and Kulu people to the number of four thousand gather together; wool and blankets are largely sold.\n\nNAW\u00c1H\u00cd.\n\nNaw\u00e1h\u00ed is about 20 miles south-west of Mandi. There is a large temple dedicated to a goddess having nine arms, hence the name Naw\u00e1h\u00ed.\nThe temple is of an ancient date and supposed to be built by Mahla Rajputs of Mahal Mori district. This temple has got many smaller shrines all round. Here also are tombs of Gosains who are buried in sitting posture with tumuli, generally conical in form erected over them.\n\nA large fair is held here in June, about ten thousand people from Mandi and Kangra attend.\n\nThe Riwalsar lake lies about ten miles south-west of Mandi, some 5,000 feet above sea-level.\n\nIt was chosen as a place of retirement and devotion by the great Rishi Lomas, whose name is mentioned in the Skandh Purana of the Hindu Mythology. There it is said that the Rishi Lomas used to bathe in the waters of the Ganges and Jumna. By the power of God both the streams joining together made this great lake for his sake. The circumference of the lake exceeds a mile, and its waters are of immense depth. There are many large floating islands on its surface and this singular fact is attributed to its sanctity. Pilgrims from all parts of India visit the lake which is an important place of pilgrimage for the Lamas of Tibet who pay it a visit in the cold weather. A great fair is held here on the 1st of Baisakh every year at which about four thousand persons assemble. The Lamas built here a separate temple of their own a few years ago. Duck in large numbers frequent the lake, but as it is sacred, sportsmen are not allowed to shoot them.\nAPPENDIX I.\n\nTHE DIALECTS OF MANDI AND SUKET.\n\nBY\n\nThe Revd. T. Grahame Bailey, B.D., M.R.A.S.\n\nINTRODUCTION.\n\nMandi and Suket are two important states lying between Simla and Kangra proper with Kul\u0101 for their eastern boundary. They form part of the central linguistic wedge between Camba and the Simla States, it being noticeable that north of Kangra and south of Suket certain linguistic peculiarities are found which are not observed in the central area. The future in l alluded to in the Introduction to the Camba Dialects (see Appendix to Gazetteer of Camba State) is a good example of this. In the central wedge the future is in g or gh, whereas to the north and south and east it is in l.\n\nThe main Mandi dialect is rather widely spread. It is found with very little change over all the western and northern portions of the State. It is also spoken in the capital, and extends without much variation southwards into Suket. In the following pages a grammar of this dialect is given, followed by brief paradigms to illustrate the northern dialects. The centre of North Mand\u0113j\u012b may be taken to be Jhatin-gr\u012b half-way between Sultanpur and Palampur. Chot\u0101 Bangh\u0101l\u012b, as alluded to in the following pages, is spoken in that portion of Chot\u0101 Bangh\u0101l\u012b which lies in the extreme northern portion of Mandi State. In the south-east portion of the State called Man\u1e0di Siraj the dialect spoken is still Mand\u0113j\u012b, but it shows resemblances to Inner Siraji, the dialect of the northern half of the Siraj Tahsil of Kul\u0101.\n\nIn Mand\u0113j\u012b the genitive is formed by the postposition r\u0101, the Dative by j\u014d, and the Ablative by g\u0113 or th\u00e9.\n\nAlthough the dialect shows many traces of the influence of Panjabi, it keeps clear of that influence in the Plural of nouns, which is in the Oblique generally the same as the Singular except in the Vocative case. In parts of the State we have the special Fem. Oblique form for 3rd Pers. Pronouns so characteristic of Kul\u0101 and the Simla States. The future is either indeclinable in \u2014yy or declinable in\u2014gh\u0101.\n\nThe Pres. Part in composition is indeclinable, as kar\u0101 h\u0101, is doing, which reminds us of the Kashmiri participle kar\u0101n. Another\nresemblance to Kashmiri is in the confusion between \u0113 and ye. Thus we find t\u0113s used interchangeably with ty\u0113s, \u0113s with y\u0113s, \u0113thi with i\u0113thi (y\u0113thi). The interchange of s and h finds frequent exemplification in the hill states, e.g., in the Pres. Auxiliary h\u0101 and s\u0101 or \u1e63\u0101. See the dialects passim.\n\nMand\u0113\u0101li has a Stative Participle in\u2014\u012br\u0101, thus pa\u012br\u0101, in the state of having fallen, pitir\u0101, in the state of having been drunk. The peculiarity of the verb b\u0101h\u0101, beat, has been alluded to under the Verb in Mand\u0113\u0101li and Ch\u014d\u1e6d\u0101 Bangh\u0101li, and under the latter dialect will be found a reference to an interesting undeclined participle used in the Passive to give the sense of ability.\n\nIn Suk\u0113t there are said to be three dialects\u2014Pah\u0101r, Dhar and Bahal, but this is obviously an over-refinement. I have not had an opportunity of studying them at first hand, and therefore make the following remarks with some reserve.\n\nThe Singular of nouns is practically the same as in Mand\u0113\u0101li, but in the Plural Panj\u0101bi influence is shown in the Oblique termination\u2014\u0101. The Agent Plural, however, ends in \u2014\u012br\u0101. th\u0113 is used for the Ablative postposition, g\u0113 being generally kept for the purpose of comparison of Adjectives. The pronouns are almost the same as in Mand\u0113\u0101li.\n\nIn Verbs we find that the Dhar dialect resembles Panj\u0101bi in its Pres. Part. in\u2014\u0101, and in its Past Part. in\u2014\u0101. The Bahal dialect has its Pres. Indic. like Mand\u0113\u0101li, as m\u0101r\u0101 h\u0101, but in the Imperfect has the peculiar double form, m\u0101r\u0101 h\u0101 th\u0101, he was beating, m\u0101r\u0101 h\u0113 th\u0113, they were beating. The Suk\u0113ti dialects make their future in gh and possibly g or \u1e45g, and have the Stative Participle in\u2014\u012br\u0101, as m\u0101r\u012br\u0101, in the state of having been beaten. The Auxiliary Present and Past is the same as in Mand\u0113\u0101li.\n\nThe system of transliteration is that of the Asiatic Society of Bengal. i denotes the sound half-way between i and \u0113, u italicised in a word printed in ordinary type is half-way between u and \u016b; ou similarly italicised represents the sound of e in French je; c is the sound of ch in child, ch is the corresponding aspirate.\n\nT.

In the Settlement all the fields and wastes were measured by the chain, and the areas carefully calculated in ghumaos, kanals, and marlas from the measurements, though the field maps prepared were of a rough description, and not exactly according to scale. Saraj and Chohar ilaqas were not measured. As the common people could not understand chain measurements, the old system of seed measure was also retained and entered in the khataunis. A patha is the measure used to weigh seed, and a field receiving a patha of seed is said to be one patha, and so on; thus:\n\n20 pathas = one lakh.\n20 lakhs = one kh\u00e1r.\n\nThe weight of a patha varies with the kind of grain. The specific gravity of mash, saryura, maize, wheat and husked rice is about the same, and a patha of any of these grains weighs about 4 sers kachcha. Barley, dh\u00e1n (unhusked rice), kodra and kangni are of the same weight, and a patha of any of these grains is equivalent to 3 sers kachcha. An estimate for the quantity of seed required to sow each particular field in each tract was then prepared, allowance being made for the quality of the soil, and thus the revenue rate on a kh\u00e1r of land was fixed. This is still in force.\n\nThe returns by kh\u00e1rs are converted into ghumaos and acres by the following tables:\n\nKh\u00e1r measures.\n\nOne lakh = 6 kanals and 13 marlas.\nOne patha = 6 1/3ths marlas.\nOne kh\u00e1r = 16 ghumaos, 5 kanals, 6 marlas.\n\nOne ghumao = 24 pathas.\nOne kanal = 3 pathas.\nOne marla = 3/5ths of a patha.\n\nGhumao measurements.\n\n57 1/2 inches = one karam\n3 sq. kurams = 1 marla = 22.96 sq. yds.\n20 marlas = 1 kanal = 459.2 \"\n8 sq. kanals = 1 ghumao = 3,673.6 \"\n1 acre = 4,840 sq. yds.\n\nThere are two kinds of kh\u00e1rs in use in Mandi, one the Chauntra-ki-kh\u00e1r, and the other the Garh-ki-kh\u00e1r. In the Chauntra kh\u00e1r the seed is estimated at from 2 to 6 lakhs, and the revenue at from Rs. 4 to Rs. 12 per kh\u00e1r, according to the quality of the soil, while in the Garh kh\u00e1r the seed is estimated at from 12 to 16 lakhs and the revenue from Rs. 25 to Rs. 50.\n\nThe measures of weight are as follows:\n\nThe unit, to start with, is the sirsa\u00ed, which is equivalent to two tolas, Imperial weight:\n\n3 sirsa\u00eds = 1 pao\n6 sirsa\u00eds = 1 pao\n12 sirsa\u00eds = 1 ser\n\n24 sirsa\u00eds = 1 ser kachcha.\n5 sers = 1 balli or panseri.\n10 sers = 1 dhari.\n\n40 sers = 1 kachcha man.\nThe country *ser* (*kachcha ser*) is two-fifths of the Imperial *ser*, and, in like manner, the country *man* is two-fifths of the Imperial *man* and equal to 16 Imperial *sers*.\n\nIn Saraj, seed measurements are in *path\u00e1s* and *bh\u00e1rs*. The *patha* is the same as above, and 16 *path\u00e1s* make a *bh\u00e1r*. In Chohar, Uttars\u00e1l Sanor, Pindoh and Nachan districts the measurements are in *path\u00e1s* and *bhandas*:\n\n- 16 *path\u00e1s* = one *lakh* (or 16 annas).\n- 16 *lakhs* = one *bhand*.\n\n**Notes on the Settlement Records.**\n\n(1) The Settlement records consisted of the following papers\u2014\n\n(a) A kishtw\u00e1r shajra of each village (or garh).\n\n(b) A khasra and a khewat of each village and a statement of customs respecting rights and liabilities; one for each village, bound together.\n\n(2) The fields were measured by the chain, and area calculated in *ghumaos*, *kanals* and *marlas*.\n\n(3) The following estimate was prepared for the quantity of seed required for sowing per *ghumao* of land of different soil\u2014\n\n| Nahri 1st class | ... | ... | ... | 32 *path\u00e1s* |\n|-----------------|-----|-----|-----|-------------|\n| Do. 2nd         | ... | ... | ... | 27 do.      |\n| Do. 3rd         | ... | ... | ... | 24 do.      |\n| B\u00e1r\u00e1n\u00ed 1st      | ... | ... | ... | 27 do.      |\n| Do. 2nd         | ... | ... | ... | 24 do.      |\n| Do. 3rd         | ... | ... | ... | 22 do.      |\n\n(4) Ghumaon measurements were turned into *path\u00e1s* at the rates given above.\n\n(5) The old assessment rate per *kh\u00e1r* of land fixed for each village (given in the old jamabandis) was consulted, and revenue then calculated at a fair rate.\nAPPENDIX III.\n\nSUPPLEMENT TO DEATH CEREMONIES.\n\nOn the death of the late Raja Bejai Sen, his ashes were taken to Hardwar with great pomp and ceremony.\n\nThe ashes were allowed to remain at the cremating place in Mandi for five days, on the sixth they were kneaded with barley-flour and the leaves of the holy basil plant. Of the dough an image somewhat resembling the late Raja was prepared, and, adorned with beautiful clothes and ornaments, was placed in a litter.\n\nThis litter was taken to Hardwar, accompanied by peacock-plume bearers, mace-bearers, yak-tail bearers, and a bodyguard of infantry. An elephant and several horses led the procession.\n\nOn arrival at Hardwar, after the usual pind-dan ceremony, the image was launched into the Ganges, all the clothes, etc., being made over to the Mandi Parohit resident at Hardwar.\n\nThe appointment of a Pret P\u00e1l\u00fa was also an interesting custom observed on the death of the late Raja.\n\nPret means 'departed', and P\u00e1l\u00fa 'feeder': Pret P\u00e1l\u00fa is the one through whom the departed soul is fed.\n\nOn the death of the Raja a young handsome Brahmin, well versed in Sanskrit was selected as Pret P\u00e1l\u00fa.\n\nHe was fed with khir (milk and rice), touched with the hand of the dead Raja very shortly after his death, and from that moment was entertained for a full year with practically all the pomp and splendour of the late Raja.\n\nAll the articles in daily use by the late Raja were given him, it being believed that the soul of the dead man would receive nourishment through the substitute, and thus be supported on its daily travels up to the higher regions which take a full lunar year. After the year was ended, the Pret P\u00e1l\u00fa was supplied with clothes, ornaments and cash sufficient to provide him for life, and turned out of the State never to re-enter it. Having been excommunicated, according to custom, he could not visit his home, and so retired from the world altogether to pass the remaining days of his life quietly at Hardwar.\nAPPENDIX IV.\n\nNOTES ON PAST ADMINISTRATION.\n\n(a) During the reign of the late Raja Bejai Sen, his Chief Secretary, Mian Man Singh, introduced a system of accounts (1879). Estimates of revenue and expenditure were, for the first time, prepared by him.\n\n(b) In 1889 Col. Gordon Young, Commissioner of Jullundur, made some rules for the better administration of the State. Under these rules the period of limitation for money suits was reduced from 40 to 20 years; except in the cases of money lent on book accounts or verbally, in which cases 12 and 3 years, respectively, were fixed.\n\n(c) In 1889 H. J. Maynard, Esq., I.C.S., was appointed as Counsellor to the Raja. He reduced many of the vague methods of procedure to writing.\n\nThus Civil and Criminal suits were defined and classified. Instructions were issued for the guidance of the Courts. Rules for the hearing of appeals and revisions were modified, and periods of limitation fixed.\n\nNominally, all these rules are now in force, but of course the Raja has always allowed himself a very wide discretion.\n\nMr. Maynard also made a careful note about begar labour, and practically codified many of the old rules regarding the relationship of landlord and tenant, the granting of waste, enhancement of rent, etc.\nAPPENDIX V.\n\nRULE REGULATING RIGHTS IN FORESTS WRITTEN UP BY MR. MAYNARD.\n\n(1) The lopping of deodar is strictly forbidden. Right-holders may lop other trees up to the half height of such trees, provided the branches cut do not exceed 3 feet in length and 2 inches (1 ungal) in thickness.\n\n(2) Gaddis have the right of lopping trees (not deodars) for fodder.\n\n(3) Torches are to be made of dry wood only.\n\n(4) Grass-burning in or near a forest is only allowed with the r\u0101kh\u0101\u2019s permission.\n\n(5) No one is allowed to enter a forest with torches, from (a) 1st Chet until the end of S\u0101wan; (b) from 15th Bhadon until 15th Maghar.\n\n(6) No charcoal-burning is allowed within 100 paces of a forest. Oak and rhododendron are to be given freely for charcoal-making, also the stumps of deodar and blue pine.\n\n(7) Grazing of cattle is forbidden in certain forests for a certain period, but right-holders are allowed to cut grass in these forests for their cattle.\n\n(8) Right-holders can cut spruce and silver fir for domestic purposes.\n\n(9) Trees for the construction of buildings are to be freely given to right-holders.\n\n(10) Superior kinds of timber, e.g., deodar and blue pine, are only to be granted from the forests when such timber is plentiful. In other cases inferior kinds of trees are to be given.\n\n(11) The following rates are charged to right-holders obtaining trees for construction of houses, etc.:\n\n- Mulberry, walnut and boxwood ... ... Re. 1 per tree.\n- Deodar ... ... ... ... as. 8 \"\n- Blue pine and chil (pinus longifolia) ... ... as. 4 \"\n\nDouble rates are charged in the case of tenants having no rights in the forests, and quadruple rates in the case of Khatri residents of Mandi town.\n\n(12) No deodar under 6 feet in girth, or pine tree under 4 feet, is to be felled.\n\n(13) Forests offences may be punished with imprisonment.\nAPPENDIX VI.\n\nNotes on Cesses levied by the State.\n\nIn addition to the fixed land revenue the following cesses are levied:\n\n(1) An appraisement is made of the tobacco crop and 2 annas per maund levied. Jagir, Muafi and Sasan lands do not pay this cess.\n\n(2) Four or five annas are levied for each working day on each sugar-cane press. If the press is being worked on contract, four annas only are charged.\n\n(3) Haryag. This cess is realized from all Jagir, Muafi and Sasan lands, a portion of the produce being taken, roughly, 1 seer of grain per 1 lakh of land.\n\n(4) Drubh (pahari jubb). The State takes a share of walnuts, lemons, pomegranates, etc. A certain number is fixed for each ilaqqa.\n\n(5) Gharat or water-mill cess. This is realized from jhiwars, or professional millers. Landholders who grind corn for their own consumption pay exceedingly little. Timber for a mill is supplied from the State forests free of charge. The cess varies from 2 annas to Rs. 4 per mill.\n\n(6) Kolhu is collected from Telis or oilmen at a rate of 8 annas to Rs. 4 per oil-mill. Timber is supplied by the State free of charge.\n\n(7) Kundhi is realized from workers in iron ore. Dhangris, 5 annas per smelting furnace.\n\n(8) Karangha is levied from Julahas or weavers: from 2 to 8 annas per loom being charged.\n\n(9) Kar or Miangna is collected from the owners of buffaloes at the rate of 5 seers kh\u00e1m per milch buffalo.\n\n(10) In cases of emergency every artisan, potter, tailor, blacksmith, etc., is required to furnish articles made by him.\nAPPENDIX VII.\n\nThe following is a list of personal attendants of the Raja and the names of the offices they hold:\n\n1. Boti, a cook.\n2. B\u00e1nth, a scullion (one who cleans the vessels of the kitchen).\n3. Andary\u00e1, a body-servant.\n4. Bh\u00e1t\u00f3, a Brahmin who is in charge of the materials of worship.\n5. Bhand\u00fa, an officer in charge of Dharmarth or charity.\n6. Bhand\u00e1r\u00ed, a guard in charge of clothes and treasure.\n7. Kothi\u00e1la, an officer in charge of granary.\n8. Panh\u00e1r\u00ed, water-carrier.\n9. Sawar, one who arranges the game sent in.\n10. Boh\u00e1r, a sweeper of the palaces.\n11. Dus\u00e1l\u00ed, one who makes plates and cups of leaves for the Raja\u2019s kitchen.\n12. M\u00e1hi, keeper of buffaloes and cows.\n13. Maks\u00fad\u00ed, one who keeps medicine, betel-nuts and cardamums.\n14. Gang\u00e1 J\u00e1l\u00ed, one who keeps drinking-water.\n15. H\u00edr\u00fa, an assistant of Maks\u00fad\u00ed, one who prepares medicines.\n16. Jalehr\u00fa, one who warms water for bathing purposes.\n17. Kanjkiya, one who accompanies a jampan or dandy, and is a sort of mate of dandy or dooly bearers.\n18. D\u00e1hr\u00fa, an orderly who is in charge of a small number of orderlies.\n19. Neg\u00ed, an officer in charge of officers who keep guard at the palace gateway.\n20. The most strange of all is the post of a \u2018taster\u2019 who is called ch\u00e1lkha. He is a very reliable and faithful servant, and his duty is to taste every dish before it is served to the Raja, for fear he should be poisoned.\nGAZETTEER OF THE SUKET STATE,\nPART A.\u20141904.\nAgents for the sale of Punjab Government Publications.\n\nIN LONDON.\nE.

INTEREST.\n\nPlaces of Interest | 44 |\nCHAPTER I.\u2014DESCRIPTIVE.\n\nSection A.\u2014Physical Aspects.\n\nThe State of Suket lies between $31^\\circ 13'$ and $31^\\circ 35'$ N. and $76^\\circ 49'$ and $77^\\circ 26'$ E. on the north bank of the Sutlej, in a bend of that river which encircles it from Farenu village on the east to Dehar on the west. It is bordered on the north by its daughter State of Mandi, and on the east the Bisna stream separates it from the Sar\u00e1j Tahsil of the K\u00fal\u00fa sub-division of the Kangra District. On the south the Sutlej separates it from the Simla Hill States of Shangri, Bhajji, Bh\u00e1gal, Mangal and Bil\u00e1spur, which latter also borders it on the west. It forms a long oval strip of territory lying east and west, with a tongue of fertile country, in which lies Suket its ancient capital and BANED the present residence of the R\u00e1ja, jutting out from its north-west corner into Mandi territory. From east to west its greatest length does not exceed 34 miles and its width is some 10 or 12 miles throughout as the crow flies, but owing to the hilly character of the country the actual length and breadth are much greater. The State has an area of some 420 square miles and a population of 54,676 souls, according to the census of 1901.\n\nSuket is divided naturally into a small fertile plain enclosed by low hills lying in the Beas basin and a large mountainous region comprising the greater part of the State in the Sutlej basin. The former is known as Balh, it contains the capital and the headquarters of the Balh tehsil; south of this is a small tract known as the Dher il\u00e1ka which is at present included in Balh Tehsil.\n\nThe latter tract known as Karsog forms the Pah\u00e1r Tehsil, it is broken up into a series of valleys by branches of the great Jalori range of the Himalayan chain. The highest point in the State is Choasi Hill.\n\nThe valleys are for the most part steep and narrow but around Karsog town and Mamal there is a wide stretch of comparatively level land rivalling the Balh in fertility. As the greater length of the State lies East and West and the hills lie roughly north and south, the whole area is cut up into a series of disconnected valleys rendering communication difficult and travelling arduous. The paths are steep and tortuous and distances in consequence exaggerated.\n\nOn the north bank of the Sutlej at Drah\u00e1t village is a hot spring, which flows out of a place in the bank of the river when it is in flood and from a spot almost in the river-bed itself when it is low. Another spring rises at the foot of a hill, half a\nmile from the river. The results of the analyses made are given below:\n\nResult of analyses of Suket State springs:\n\n(i) \u2014 QUALITATIVE.\n\n| Sources          | Physical qualities | Reaction       | Free carbonic acid | Chlorids | Sulphates | Magnesia | Ammonia |\n|------------------|--------------------|----------------|--------------------|----------|-----------|----------|---------|\n| T\u00e1t\u00e1 water Suket.| Good               | Slightly acid  | Moderate amount    | Precipitate | Precipitate | Much     | Traces  |\n\nThere are no traces of sulphates, nitrates, nitrites, lime or iron.\n\n(ii) \u2014 QUANTITATIVE.\n\n| Sources          | Total hardness | Permanent hardness | Total solid, per gallon | Free ammonia, per gallon | Chloride (as NaCl), per gallon | Amount of oxygen, per gallon | Amount of oxygen required for easily oxidizable matter, per gallon | Nitrogen acid, per gallon |\n|------------------|----------------|--------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------|\n| T\u00e1t\u00e1 water Suket.| 57             | 2                  | 48.2                    | .0096                    | .0008                          | 16.7188                     | .0376                                           | 21.253                 |\n\nThe former spring is called T\u00edrath t\u00e1t\u00e1 p\u00e1ni (t\u00e1t\u00e1-hot) and pilgrims from distant places visit it.\n\nThe climate is mild and agreeable to Europeans; the rainfall is general and evenly distributed. The greater portion of the cultivated area is free from snow throughout the winter, while in summer the scorching heat of the plains is never felt.\n\nIntermittent fever is common in the rains. Chautha (quartan fever), gilhar (goitre), rheumatism and dyspepsia are the more common ailments. Venereal diseases are not so generally prevalent as in Kulu and Mandi. Smallpox is comparatively rare as vaccination is regularly carried out; when a person is found to be suffering from it he is isolated and some one who has already had the disease attends upon him.\n\nLeprosy is very rare. Cholera is said to have broken out only once in the last 25 years.\n\nWild flowers and flowering shrubs and trees are common. The most common of the Pines is the Chil (Pinus Longifolia) but Blue pine (kail), Deodar (kelu), Spruce (Rai), Silverfir (Tos) are found in the hilly tracts.\n\nOther common trees are the Oak (b\u00e1n and mohru), Box (chikri), Elm (m\u00e1rn), Shisham, Horse chestnut (khanor), Rhododendron (br\u00e1s), Wild peach (\u00e1ru), Apricot (s\u00e1ri), Green plum (aluch\u00e1), Wild apple (p\u00e1lu), Wild pear (shegal), simbal and mango.\nThe berberry is common and its yellow wood (rasaunt) is largely exported.\n\nThe chief wild animals of interest are black bear, leopard, jackal, musk deer, gooral, barking deer (kakkur), pig, monkeys and langur; amongst game birds may be mentioned the more common pheasants, kalesha, chir, quaksha and moonal, chickor, partridge, peacock and pigeon. Quail are found in small numbers in the autumn and duck in the Balh and on the Sutlej in spring and autumn.\n\nThe great earthquake of 4th April 1905 caused damage in Balh and on the Eastern border; 76 people were killed and many wounded while the loss of cattle and house property was considerable.\n\nSection B.\u2014History.\n\nLIST AND CHEONOLOGY OF THE RAJAS OF SUKET.\n\n| No. | Name                  | Reigned from (Sambat) | A.D. | Duration of reign |\n|-----|-----------------------|-----------------------|------|------------------|\n| 1   | Bir Sain              | 1268                  | 1211 | 35 years         |\n| 2   | Dhir Sain             |                       |      | 7                |\n| 3   | Bikram Sain           |                       |      | 10               |\n| 4   | Dhartari Sain         |                       |      |                  |\n| 5   | Lakshman Sain         |                       |      | 25               |\n| 6   | Chandar Sain          |                       |      | 20               |\n| 7   | Bije Sain             |                       |      | 21               |\n| 8   | Sahi Sain             |                       |      | 11               |\n| 9   | Katan Sain            |                       |      | 14               |\n| 10  | Bilis Sain (poisoned) |                       |      |                  |\n| 11  | Samuddar Sain         |                       |      | 4                |\n| 12  | Hawand Sain           |                       |      | (Died after a reign of one year). |\n| 13  | Balwant Sain          |                       |      | 2 years          |\n| 14  | Sawant Sain           |                       |      | 25               |\n| 15  | Five Rulers in succession |                   |      |                  |\n| 20  | Madan Sain            |                       |      | 26               |\n| 21  | Hamir Sain to Sangram Sain |                 |      |                  |\n\n(Note.\u2014Sangram Sain was 28th ruler after Bir Sain).\n\n| 29  | Mahan Sain            |                       |      | 10 years         |\n| 30  | Haibat Sain           |                       |      | 5                |\n| 31  | Amar Sain             |                       |      |                  |\n| 32  | One Raja and then Ajimar-dan Sain, | | | |\n| 33  | Parbat Sain           |                       |      | 9                |\n| 34  | Kartar Sain           |                       |      | 22               |\n| 35  | Arjan Sain            |                       |      | 7                |\n| 36  | Uday Sain             |                       |      | 11               |\n| 37  | Dip Sain              |                       |      | 12               |\n| 38  | Shams Sain            |                       |      | 12               |\n| 39  | Ram Sain              |                       |      | 5                |\n| 40  | Jit Sain              |                       |      | 28               |\n| 41  | Garud Sain            |                       |      | (Died in Sambat 1805), 27 years. |\n| 42  | Bhikam Sain           |                       |      | (Died in Sambat 1819, A.D. 1762), 14 years. |\n| 43  | Ranjit Sain           |                       |      | (Accidentally poisoned in Sambat 1848, 1791, A.D.), 29 years. |\n| 44  | Bikraman Sain         |                       |      | (Died in Sambat 1805, 1898 A.D.), 47 years. |\nSukhdeo and Lomus Muni were celebrated Rishis whose histories are recorded in the Skanda Puran, some verses from which are quoted below. They show that Lomus Muni underwent penance at Raw\u00e1lsar which is to this day a famous place of pilgrimage in the Mandi State to which people resort for worship. In a dense forest 2 jojans or 8 kos south of Raw\u00e1lsar, and near Nagar in this State, is a cave, in which Sukhdeo unfastened the key of knowledge for Lomus Muni and made him his disciple.\n\nTranslation of the verses from the Skanda Puran. \"At a distance of 2 jojans or 8 kos from and towards the south of Lomus Muni's famous place of pilgrimage, Raw\u00e1lsar where the Muni performed his penance and below the mountains of T\u00e1m\u00edr Kot and Tarawari is a forest, beautiful and dense. Sukhdeo found a great cave in the centre of this jungle, and entering it he meditated on God. He was in the habit of bathing daily in the Ganges and Jumna and by the grace of God, both rivers, the Ganges and her companion the Jumna, rose in this country to enable him to perform his daily ablutions. In truth this place is properly the seat of Brahma.\" Since Sukhdeo took up his abode here it has come to be known by the name of Suket.\n\nThe large cave in which Sukhdeo meditated is said to extend to the Ganges, its depths are yet unfathomed, its full extent unexplored; none but Sadhus and Brahmins are allowed inside and as these are afraid to proceed far the mystery is carefully preserved.\n\nOutside the cave are two springs supplying two small tanks, one is supposed to be water of the Ganges, the other of the Jumna.\n\nThe History of Suket is unimportant except in so far as it discloses the antiquity of the dynasty.\n\nBriefly it may be stated that an ancestor of the present R\u00e1j\u00e1 left Bengal about A.D. 1200, his grandson arrived somewhere near the present site of the State in A.D. 1211 and proceeded to establish himself there; after various vicissitudes of fortune the State submitted to the British after the war of A.D. 1846. For those who desire further details the following summary is given.\n\nAfter the conquest of Bengal in 1259 Sambat, Sur Sain the Gaur sought a refuge in Pray\u00e1g, now Allahabad, and on his death his son R\u00fap Sain retired to Rupar from which he expelled the Muhammadans and, refounding the town, named it Nihad. With him came his three sons Bir Sain, Giri Sain and Ham\u00edr Sain. At Rupar a son was born to Bir Sain who was named Dhir Sain, in 1266 Sambat.\n\nIn the following year R\u00fap Sain was killed in a battle with the Muhammadans, and his three sons fled to the hills, Bir Sain turning his steps towards Suket, Giri Sain to Keunthal and Ham\u00edr\nSain to Kishtw\u00e1r. In Sambat 1268 B\u00eer Sain crossed the Sutlej and came to Ji\u00fbri, a ferry on the bank of that river; thence he attacked the neighbouring chiefs. The chief of Karali who ruled Dret, his ally R\u00e2na Sri M\u00e2ngal, whose fort was at Batw\u00e2r\u00e2, the chief of Nagra who held Kot and Parnaga il\u00e2q\u00e2s, the chief of Char\u00e2ghw\u00e2la who held the Bat\u00e2l il\u00e2q\u00e2 and Ch\u00e2wand\u00ee, the th\u00e2kur of Chediw\u00e2la who ruled Udipur all yielded to him. The latter chief was at feud with the R\u00e2na Sany\u00e2rto who claimed to be the overlord of all that territory and he warned B\u00eer Sain that until Sany\u00e2rto was subdued his rule over the country he had conquered would be but precarious. Upon this B\u00eer Sain collected his forces for an attack on Sany\u00e2rto and advanced first on Khunu, whose th\u00e2kur hearing of his advance fled. B\u00eer Sain then took the fort of Masil which he held for a long period. Thence he again attacked Sany\u00e2rto, whose fort of P\u00e2li and th\u00e2n\u00e2s of Kajun and Dhy\u00e2r\u00e2 Kot fell after a long and severe struggle, the R\u00e2na Deo P\u00e1l being taken prisoner. On the establishment of his power throughout the whole country however Deo P\u00e1l was released and a jag\u00eer assigned to him for his maintenance which his descendants held till the time of R\u00e2j\u00e2 Sh\u00e2m Sain.\n\nWhen he had completely subdued the country B\u00eer Sain sent for his family and built a palace on the skirts of the Kunnu Dh\u00e2r at a place still called Narol, a name which means 'privacy.' Then with the aid of the forces of th\u00e2n\u00e2 Kajun which he had taken from R\u00e2na Sany\u00e2rto, he attacked the th\u00e2kur of Koti Dhar and by stratagem wrested from him his il\u00e2q\u00e2s of Nanj, Sal\u00e2lu, Belu and th\u00e2na Magra. He built forts at Kajun and Magra, hitherto mere open villages. Up till now B\u00eer Sain had confined his conquests to the territories of the petty chiefs west of the Sutlej, but he now proceeded to carry his arms to the south-west of his newly acquired dominions and invaded the territory of the th\u00e2kur of Kandli Kot who offered no resistance. The th\u00e2kur of Surhi who held the th\u00e2n\u00e2s of Chandm\u00e2r\u00e2 and Jahor and the il\u00e2q\u00e2 of P\u00e2ngna seeing his power came in person to tender his submission and further incited him to attack the th\u00e2kur of Hary\u00e2r\u00e2 with whom he was at feud. That chief on hearing of the R\u00e2j\u00e2's prowess fled from his principality and B\u00eer Sain settled the country and converted Tikar hitherto a th\u00e2na into a fort which is still known by that name. He also built the palace of P\u00e2ngna in the Surhi il\u00e2q\u00e2 on a hill 5,000 feet above sea-level. He next built the fort of Chaw\u00e2s\u00ee. Subsequently he conquered the fort of B\u00eerkot, on the borders of Kumbh\u00e2rsain. The P\u00e2ngna palace is still well preserved.\n\nWith Chaw\u00e2s\u00ee as his base he advanced into Sar\u00e2j in which tract he conquered the forts of Srigarh, Naraingarh, Raghopur, J\u00e2nj, Jalauri, Himri, Raigarth, Chanjw\u00e2la, Magru, M\u00e2ngarh, Tung, Madhopur, Bang\u00fb, Fatehpur, B\u00e1mth\u00e2j, Raisan, Gad\u00e2h and Koth Manali, which were under different th\u00e2kurs, and taking possession of Parol, Lag, Rupi, S\u00e2ri and Dumhri he continued his advance.\nThe R\u00e1j\u00e1 of K\u00fal\u00fa, Bhop\u00e1l by name, advanced to repel this aggression but he was defeated and taken prisoner. B\u00edr Sain however subsequently released him, restoring his dominions to him on payment of an annual tribute. On his return B\u00edr Sain conquered Pandoh, N\u00e1chni, and other territories including Garh Chiry\u00e1han, Raiy\u00e1han, Jur\u00e1handi, Satgarh, Na\u00fandgarh, Chachiot, and Saw\u00e1puri. Having thus conquered the northern part of the State he turned to the west and took Nir\u00e1h and other forts and the Bal il\u00e1qa, advancing to the Sikandra Dh\u00e1r, where he defeated R\u00e1n\u00e1 Hatli, in commemoration of which victory he built the fort of Birkot now called Biharkot on the Dh\u00e1r. He thus subdued the whole country as far as Hatli making the summit of the lofty S\u00edr Khad range on the borders of the Kangra kingdom, his frontier. Here he built the fort of Bira which like that of Birkot now lies in the State of Mandi. Thus B\u00edr Sain\u2019s dominions extended from the Sutlej on the south to the Beas on the north, and on the east the former river also divided his territories from those of Bashahr, while on the west they extended to the Asir Khad, the border of the Kanuchun kingdom. B\u00edr Sain died after a reign of 35 years.\n\nThe reign of his successor, Dhir Sain, was uneventful and he died after a reign of 7 years. Bikram Sain, the third R\u00e1j\u00e1 was a pious ruler who went on a pilgrimage to Hardw\u00e1r, and his younger brother Tiri Bikram Sain seized the opportunity to usurp the kingdom which had been committed to his care. In this act he was supported by H\u00e1yat P\u00e1l the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of K\u00fal\u00fa, to whom he surrendered the kingdom. Two years later when Bikram Sain returned he learnt on his arrival at Bhajji that his brother had proved false to his trust and being without means to recover his rights sought aid from his kinsman the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Keunthal. With his aid Bikram attacked the usurper, who was aided by the K\u00fal\u00fa R\u00e1j\u00e1, and the two armies met at Ji\u00fari on the Sutlej. In the bloody battle which ensued Tiri Bikram Sain and the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of K\u00fal\u00fa were both slain and Bikram Sain recovered his kingdom. Further in revenge for the countenance given to his brother by the K\u00fal\u00fa R\u00e1j\u00e1 he seized that kingdom, conferring on its heir a pension which continued for three generations. He died after a reign of 10 years.\n\nBikram Sain was succeeded by his son Dhartari Sain, who died after an uneventful reign; both his elder sons had died in his lifetime, the younger Kh\u00e1ndei Rao having assumed the name of Kharak Sain on becoming heir apparent. His son Lakshman Sain succeeded as a minor of two years old and Hash\u00edr P\u00e1l the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of K\u00fal\u00fa seized the opportunity to regain his independence and the ministers of the State were unable to withstand him, but on attaining his majority in his sixteenth year Lakshman Sain overran waz\u00edris Rupi, Lag, S\u00e1ri and part of waz\u00edri Parol. He ruled 25 years. The reigns of his son Chandar Sain and grandson Bije Sain were peaceful; they reigned for 10 and 20 years, respectively. S\u00e1hu Sain was the son of the latter and his reign was only eventful for\nthe quarrel between him and his brother B\u0101hu Sain who took refuge in Kul\u016b and whose descendants were designed to found the State of Mandi eleven generations later. His successor Ratan Sain also had a peaceful reign, but he left two sons Bil\u0101s Sain and Samuddar Singh of whom the elder succeeded in due course. His rule was however oppressive and he was poisoned by his subjects, whereupon the officials resolved that his brother Samuddar Singh should succeed and that his son Sewant Sain, a boy of two years of age, should be put to death. The R\u0101n\u012b, the boy's mother however fled to a zam\u012bnd\u0101r in Sar\u0101j; where she remained for some years, keeping her identity secret, until a jogi foretold that the boy would one day come to his throne. Meanwhile Samuddar Singh had ascended the throne under the title of Samdar Sain. He ruled for four years and died leaving two sons, Hewant Sain and Balwant Singh who each succeeded to the throne but died before they attained their majority. Thus the State was left without a R\u0101j\u0101, and the officials accordingly had search made for the son of Bil\u0101s Sain, who was discovered in the zam\u012bnd\u0101r's house in Sar\u0101j and placed upon the throne. Thereupon he conferred the village which had given him asylum upon the zam\u012bnd\u0101r in jag\u012br and built a kot which he named R\u0101nikot after his mother in memory of his day of hardship. This building has long since disappeared but the taluka, which lies in Garh Chaw\u0101si of the Suket il\u0101qa, is still known as R\u0101ni-k\u0101-kot.\n\nThe next five reigns were uneventful. R\u0101j\u0101 Mantar Sain died without an heir, and the crown devolved on Mian Liyun Phiyun who was descended from Mantar Sain's great-grandfather Bil\u0101dar Sain's younger brother but he was incapable of rule and so the people and officials hit upon this device:\u2014It was resolved that one day a general fast should be held and the next day a feast at which messengers were to appear bringing bad news. The Mians would be judged by their conduct and he who acted best elected to the throne. This plan was carried out and at the feast messengers came in announcing that the R\u0101n\u0101 of N\u0101chmi and others had rebelled and burnt some villages. Liyun Phiyun said they could attend to the matter after the feast was over, but Mian Madan who had been a miller declared that it was no time for feasting and arming himself he left the assembly. The people applauding his promptitude and courage followed him and brought him back and as after Liyun Phiyun he was the next heir to the throne, he was elected king by acclamation. He accordingly assumed the title of Madan Sain. His first act was to set out to exact reparation from the R\u0101n\u0101 of N\u0101chmi and starting from P\u0101ngn\u0101 he built a fort two kos to the North of it which he called Madankot and which is now known as Maidangarh in Mandi territory. Thence he attacked N\u0101chmi and subdued the R\u0101n\u0101 who pointed out that he had not been guilty of any act of rebellion. Madan Sain thus learnt of the device of his officials and received the submission of the R\u0101n\u0101. He then advanced to the Pandoh il\u0101qa and passing through it crossed\nHaving captured the Dr\u00e1ng mines he met the R\u00e1n\u00e1 of G\u00fana whom he defeated after a severe struggle. During the disorders which had arisen on the death of Mantar Sain the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Kul\u00fa, Kahr\u00e1l P\u00e1l, had thrown off his allegiance and Madan Sain was compelled to wage war against him. In this he was successful; after a long struggle he regained all the country that his forefathers had conquered, fixing his boundary at the villages of Rholi and Kothi, and on his return he built the fort of Madanpur the ruins of which are still to be seen in Kothi Khokhan in K\u00e1l\u00fa. He then returned through Chaw\u00e1s\u00ed to his capital and after an interval started southwards to subdue the R\u00e1n\u00e1s of Bhajji, S\u00e1ngri and Kumh\u00e1rs\u00e1i who had revolted and thrown off the yoke of Suket. These R\u00e1n\u00e1s he reduced to obedience and they remained tributary to Suket down to the commencement of British rule. R\u00e1na Sri M\u00e1ngal whose home was in Batw\u00e1r\u00ed, now known as Fort Batw\u00e1r\u00ed attached himself to the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Bil\u00e1spur and rebelled, but Madan Sain expelled him from his dependency and annexed it to his own kingdom. The R\u00e1n\u00e1 then founded the independent State of M\u00e1ngal.\n\nMadan Sain then turned westward and reaching Birkot he subdued R\u00e1na Hatli who had also become independent. He then marched straight on, overwhelming the th\u00e1kurs of Mahal Mor\u00edan, across the Saml\u00e1\u00ed range now in Kangra and the Galauri range now in Kahl\u00far, reached the Kotlehr il\u00e1qa, in which he built a fort and well at Katwilw\u00e1h which still exist, and established a boundary with Kotlehr.\n\nThen Madan Sain turned to the south and restored the forts of Seoni and Teoni, now in Bil\u00e1spur. He also erected the fort of Dhar in consequence of an omen, and this stronghold has never been taken by siege. Thence he returned by way of Bal to P\u00e1ngn\u00e1 where he ruled with firmness. One night however being warned by a devi that it was her ancient asth\u00e1n, or place of residence and that he would be ruined if he remained there, he transferred his residence to Loh\u00e1r\u00e1, now in the Mandi State. He also built a great temple at P\u00e1ngn\u00e1 at the spot where on the day after his dream he saw an image with a throne and a sword placed at his side by supernatural means. There is no doubt that the R\u00e1j\u00e1 transferred his capital to Loh\u00e1r\u00e1. He also built the temple Astamb N\u00e1th. After a reign of 25 years he died.\n\n(1) According to a promise made when crossing the river he bestowed a grant of land on the boatmen by a deed (pattra) and they still receive allowances in grain from the Mandi State.\n\nThe gist of the pattra which is dated 1988 Sambat seems to be\u2014There occurred a fight between the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Suket and Madan P\u00e1l or the R\u00e1na of Saniw\u00e1ri. The parties erected thanas and gurks (forts). The loyal Brahmins of the R\u00e1n\u00e1 who were enjoying suan muaf\u00e1 granted in the names of the deities approached R\u00e1j\u00e1 Udai Sain of Suket and represented that as thanas and gurks had been erected on their muaf\u00e1 lands, the Brahmins of the five places (sic) would perish, unless they were dismantled. This made R\u00e1j\u00e1 Udai Sain take pity on the Brahmins and he thought that as these Brahmins are gods, their lands ought to be restored to them after the forts, etc., had been demolished. The possession, however, was retained equally by R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Suket and the R\u00e1n\u00e1 of Saniw\u00e1ri and their boundaries were fixed. Saniw\u00e1ri is a village lying in the east of Karog Tahsil.\n\n(2) The huge iron scales and wooden drum captured in this battle are still preserved in the fort at P\u00e1ngn\u00e1.\nMadan Sain was succeeded by 28 R\u00e1j\u00e1s whose reigns were as a rule uneventful. Mahan Sain was an immoral and profligate ruler who conceived a passion for the wife of a Brahman who was in his service and whom he kept employed at a distance so that he might carry on the intrigue in his absence. But one day the Brahman, who had been warned that his wife was unfaithful, laid in wait for her paramour and killed him, without knowing he was the R\u00e1j\u00e1. The R\u00e1ni burnt his remains without question and as he had left no son his uncle Haibat Sain, a just and dignified ruler whose reign only lasted 5 years, succeeded to the throne. Amar Sain and Ajemardan Sain succeeded each other, their reigns being uneventful.\n\nAn incident of the reign of Parbat Sain had consequences of some importance. He disgraced a parohit who was suspected of intimacy with a slave girl band\u00ed without proof and in consequence the Brahman committed suicide. After this incident the R\u00e1j\u00e1\u2019s health began to fail though he bestowed waz\u00edri Lag and Sari on the Brahman\u2019s family, having reigned but 9 years. His successor Kart\u00e1r Sain, thinking Lobar\u00e1 was under the curse of Brahman-murder, built a new capital above the Tar\u00e1wari forest below which he founded a town which he named Kart\u00e1rpur and which is now known as Nagar Pur\u00e1n\u00e1, two miles east of Baned.\n\nKart\u00e1r Sain was married to a princess of Jasw\u00e1n, a magnanimous lady who bestowed many lands on Brahmans. He died after a glorious reign of 28 years.\n\nIn his short reign of 7 years Arjan Sain contrived to lose a large part of his dominions. Such was his arrogance that when the zamind\u00e1rs of waz\u00edri R\u00fapi came to petition him he kept them waiting some days and when he came out of his palace to see them he asked whence the kure or \u2018crows\u2019 of Rupi had come, and rejected their request. In consequence they betook themselves to the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of K\u00fal\u00fa, Bah\u00e1dur Singh, who received them courteously, and so they transferred their allegiance to him and waz\u00edri R\u00fapi was thus lost to Suket. Other th\u00e1kurs also revolted and more than half the State territory was lost. Udai Sain did something to repair the mischief. He subdued the rebellious th\u00e1kurs, among them the th\u00e1kur of Chedi whose j\u00e1gir he confiscated, building the fort of Udaipur in memory of his victory. He died after a reign of 11 years and was succeeded by Dip Sain who died after 28 years\u2019 rule, his son Sh\u00e1m Sain succeeding him.\n\nSh\u00e1m Sain had two R\u00e1n\u00eds, princesses of Goler and Bashahr. By the former he had two sons and a daughter.(1) The elder of these sons was named R\u00e1m Sain and the younger Pirthi Singh. He also had a son, named Hari Singh, by the Bashahr R\u00e1ni, and she conspired with one Mi\u00e1n Jug\u00e1hnun to make away with the R\u00e1j\u00e1\u2019s eldest son R\u00e1m Sain, but the plot was unsuccessful and she was\n\n(1) She was married to K\u00e1l\u00e1n Chand, R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Kahl\u00far.\nbanished and Jug\u00e1hnun put to death with all his family except one pregnant woman from whom the Jug\u00e1hnun Mi\u00e1ns who now live in the State are descended.\n\nSh\u00e1m Sain was summoned with his brother Naurang Singh to Lahore by Aurangzeb and commissioned to subdue a stronghold. In this they were successful and the R\u00e1j\u00e1 received a robe of honour with permission to coin his own money. The chief event of the reign, however, was the war with Kali\u00e1n Chand of Kahl\u00far. Kali\u00e1n Chand had married Sh\u00e1m Sain\u2019s daughter. One day he was playing chess with his R\u00e1ni when some bards approached and loudly praised the R\u00e1j\u00e1 in exaggerated terms calling him the ruler of seven Dh\u00e1rs. Now one of these Dh\u00e1rs belonged to the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Suket and the R\u00e1ni therefore corrected it. This exasperated the R\u00e1j\u00e1 who threw the chessboard on the R\u00e1ni\u2019s forehead and ordered his army to prepare for an attack on the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Suket. Seeing this the R\u00e1ni wrote a letter to her father with the blood which came out from the wound which she had received on her forehead warning him against the projected attack. Great preparations were made on both sides and the contending armies met on the field near Mahadeo. In the course of battle, Kali\u00e1n Chand\u2019s horse was wounded and he requested a Singhw\u00e1l Sow\u00e1r who was near at hand to lend his horse but the latter refused. Since then no Singhw\u00e1l Mi\u00e1n is allowed to get horses from the Kahl\u00far State. Kali\u00e1n Chand was mortally wounded in the battle and was under the orders of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Sh\u00e1m Sain carried to his home but on the way he died. His dead body was carried to Kahl\u00far by some Brahmans whose descendants still enjoy rent-free holdings in consideration of this service. Despite the victory over the combined forces of Kahl\u00far and Mandi the power of Suket now rapidly declined. This was attributed to the R\u00e1j\u00e1\u2019s action in giving away a chola bestowed upon him by a jogi. This jogi, by name Chand Piri, had taken up his abode in Pareri, a village close to the capital, and had received many favours from the R\u00e1j\u00e1. One day in gratitude he gave the R\u00e1j\u00e1 a chola telling him to wear it in battle, but the R\u00e1j\u00e1 thoughtlessly gave it to his groom whom it immediately reduced to ashes. For this act the jogi cursed the R\u00e1j\u00e1, and shortly afterwards died in his cave at Pareri. The R\u00e1j\u00e1 built a mandar to the jogi\u2019s memory and endowed it with a j\u00e1gir. He also assigned to it one path\u00e1 of grain to be collected from each house and all fines imposed on f\u00e1g\u00edrs throughout the State. These dues were paid to the mandar up to the time of Bikrama Sain, but were somewhat modified by Ugar Sain.\n\nThe R\u00e1j\u00e1 of N\u00farpur now complained to the emperor of the refusal of Sh\u00e1m Sain and his brother to join in the war against the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Jammu to whom they were related, and in consequence they were both summoned to Delhi and thrown into prison where Mi\u00e1n Naurang Singh died. It is also said that R\u00e1j\u00e1 M\u00e1n Singh of Goler was imprisoned at Delhi on a similar charge. The story also\ngoes that in his captivity Sh\u00e1m Sain prayed to M\u00e1hun N\u00e1g deota who appeared to him in the form of a bee and promised him deliverance. Shortly after he and the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Goler were both released by the emperor, and in gratitude he bestowed a j\u00e1gir worth Rs. 1,100 a year on the temple of the deota, who was henceforward called M\u00e1hun because he had appeared to the R\u00e1j\u00e1 in the form of a bee (m\u00e1hu). This j\u00e1gir has now been reduced to Rs. 300 a year.\n\nDuring the R\u00e1j\u00e1\u2019s captivity the R\u00e1j\u00e1s of K\u00e1l\u00fa and Mandi seized Sar\u00e1j. The former took possession of parganas Srigarh, P\u00edr Kot, Naraingarh, J\u00e1nj, Jalauri, Raghopur B\u00e1ri, Dumhri, Madanpur and Bhamri; while Mandi acquired Garh, now called Sir\u00e1j Mandi Rai Garh, Chanjw\u00e1la Maqra, Tung\u00e1si, M\u00e1dhapur, Bunga, Fatehpur, B\u00e1ri Th\u00e1j, Bagrah, B\u00e1usi and the Gud\u00e1h il\u00e1qa in collusion with some of the subject th\u00e1kurs.\n\nOn their release from Delhi R\u00e1j\u00e1s Sh\u00e1m Sain and M\u00e1n Singh returned to their kingdoms by way of Aiwan, and on the road fought with the R\u00e1na of Bashahr, who was at feud with the former R\u00e1j\u00e1 on account of his sister. It is said that the R\u00e1na fought both the R\u00e1j\u00e1s but being unsuccessful he paid Rs. 50,000 as nazar\u00e1na and obtained from them the title of R\u00e1j\u00e1. On his return M\u00e1n Singh built the fort of M\u00e1ngarh 12 miles from Nagar. Sh\u00e1m Sain also lost the Katw\u00e1lw\u00e1h il\u00e1ga to Kotlehr. He died after a reign of 31 years.\n\nR\u00e1m Sain his successor built the fort of R\u00e1mgarh to protect the people of Madhopur against the constant attacks of the Mandi people. After ruling for 5 years he became insane and was succeeded by J\u00edt Sain whose health was also weak. During his reign the Mandi R\u00e1j\u00e1 conquered the Loh\u00e1ra il\u00e1ga and fixed his border on the Suketi stream. His son Gur Sain with the help of the Kahl\u00far R\u00e1j\u00e1 conquered Garh Dhany\u00e1ra, Bera and Peri. Then Gur Sain\u2019s son Sidh Sain, aided by Bhim Chand of Kahl\u00far, conquered the Dh\u00e1r of Tahl, the fort of Birkot and Maryauli which latter il\u00e1ga he gave to Bh\u00edm Chand, keeping Tahl and Birkot in his own hands. Then one of the wazirs, Anup, who was one of the parohits, instigated the Mandi R\u00e1j\u00e1 to attack the R\u00e1na of N\u00e1chni who was unable to withstand him without support from the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Suket and this Anup contrived should not be afforded him. Still he bravely held out alone for two years until he was killed and his son Har N\u00e1th fled to Kahl\u00far, whereupon Sidh Sain took possession of the forts of N\u00e1chan, Chiry\u00e1han, Riy\u00e1han Mai\u0107\u00e1ngarh, Chaur\u00e1handi, Mastgarh, Nandgarh, Jajios (?), R\u00e1jgarh, and Shivapuri, also called H\u00e1t. After an inglorious reign of 58 years J\u00edt Sain died childless(1) and was succeeded by Garur Sain a descendant of that Hari Singh whose mother, the Bashahr princess, had been banished in the reign of Sh\u00e1m Sain. He was, however, only R\u00e1ja\n\n(1) He is said to have had 22 children who all pre-deceased him.\nin name as the Mi\u00e1ns of Pirhipur first carried on the government by forming themselves into a kind of junta, and even when the Bashahr R\u00e1j\u00e1 had written to the people and officials of above Kandhi that Garur Sain was the rightful heir and they accordingly brought him to the temple of Narsinghji at Nagar and conferred the *raj-tilak* on him, the people of the capital did not obey him out of fear of the Pirhipur Mi\u00e1ns and the *parohits* whose influence was at that time very great. Accordingly Garur Sain with a number of adherents set out for K\u00fal\u00fa where he was received by the R\u00e1j\u00e1 as the rightful king of Suket. The R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Kangra also recognized him, and sent him back to his kingdom. At Himli Garur Singh married the daughter of the *r\u00e1n\u00e1* of that place and thence returned to his capital where the people, seeing that he was supported by the R\u00e1j\u00e1s of K\u00fal\u00fa and Kangra, submitted to his authority. The Pirhipur Mi\u00e1ns thereupon fled to Garhw\u00e1l. Garur Singh now assumed the name of Garur Sain. Garur Sain founded Baned, which Bikrama Sain made the capital, abandoning Kart\u00e1rpur. Garur Sain had a wise and capable *r\u00e1n\u00ed* who constructed the Suraj Kund at Baned. By her the R\u00e1j\u00e1 had two sons Bhikam Sain and Bah\u00e1dur Singh.(1) The *devi*, however, continued to warn him against the unfaithful *parohits* in dreams and afflicted his eldest son with epilepsy. Out of reverence for the *devi* Garur Sain excommunicated the Brahmans and they became known as *n\u00e1chhuhan* ('not to be touched'). Another reason for the expulsion of the Brahmans was the loss of N\u00e1chan fort(2) by *waz\u00edr* An\u00fap who was a Brahman. He intrigued with the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Mandi with this object, *vide* R\u00e1j\u00e1 Jit Sain's account. R\u00e1na Har N\u00e1th who was the son of the R\u00e1na of Ajni, who had fled to Kahlu on his father's death now returned and the R\u00e1j\u00e1 conferred on him the *j\u00e1gir* of Ch\u00faragh which his descendants ruled independently for some generations until the death of the last R\u00e1na Bhagw\u00e1n Singh who died without issue in the time of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Uggar Sain. In accordance with the wishes of his widow a pension of Rs. 300 a year was granted them. In the reign of Uggar Sain the *n\u00e1chhuhan* Brahmans and Parauddhis were totally excommunicated and the *parohits* of the parents of the Hatalzati *r\u00e1n\u00ed* became the R\u00e1j\u00e1's priests, who remained *parohits* up to R\u00e1j\u00e1 Ugger Sain's reign. One of their descendants named Devidat *parohit* is still in the State.\n\nR\u00e1j\u00e1 Bhikam Sain succeeded in Sambat 1805. During his reign some petty wars occurred but none of them had any results. He married a princess of Hindur and had two sons, Ranjit Singh and Kishan Singh. He was succeeded in Sambat 1817 by the former. Ranjit Singh married the princesses of Sirmur and Goler and at his marriage to the latter, it is said Rs. 50,000 in cash and *khillats* worth Rs. 1,00,000 were given to the Bhats.\n\n---\n\n(1) His descendants are the Barhogwal Mi\u00e1ns.\n(2) His Highness says, parganas of Hatgarh, Birkot, and Nachan containing some 11 forts. These are still parts of Mandi.\nHis brother Mi\u00e1n Kishan Singh set forth to attack the fort of N\u00e1hni and by hard fighting took Shivapuri but his ammunition running short he sent to the R\u00e1j\u00e1 for aid. His messengers, however, were induced by Mandi diplomacy to tell the R\u00e1j\u00e1 that he aimed at independence and succour was refused him. Thereupon Kishan Singh turned to his son-in-law Sans\u00e1r Chand for help and obtained from him a large force with which he captured and burnt Suket. The Mi\u00e1n then went to Jaggann\u00e1th. Ranjit Sain was completely under the influence of Narpat, his powerful and capable waz\u00edr but his son by the Sirmur r\u00e1n\u00ed, Bikr\u00e1ma Sain, quarrelled with the too influential minister and once drew his sword upon him. After this Bikr\u00e1ma Sain withdrew to Mahall Morian, but on his father's death he returned and his first act was to imprison Narpat in the fort of Batw\u00e1ra, where he caused him to be beheaded soon after his accession in 1848 Sambat. Mi\u00e1n Kishan Singh now tendered allegiance to his nephew and advancing Rs. 80,000 out of his own pocket, with the aid of Sans\u00e1r Chand's troop wrested six strongholds from Mandi. These he loyally handed over to the Suket R\u00e1j\u00e1. The R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Mandi became Sans\u00e1r Chand's prisoner, but his people waged war for 12 years with Suket and its waz\u00edr, Punnu a Kandari Kanet, was killed in the battle at Sikandra at which the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Kah\u00edlur fought on Mandi side. Punnu, brother of Ghorkan, was then appointed waz\u00edr but he was shot when hunting by Mi\u00e1n Bishan Singh, a son of Kishan Singh, whom he had treated with discourtesy. Meanwhile the Kah\u00edlur R\u00e1j\u00e1 had called in the Gurkhas and induced Bikrama Sain to visit Kah\u00edlur where he was detained for six months in the Murli Manchar temple by the Gurkhas. During this period the Mandi R\u00e1j\u00e1 recaptured the two forts. After six months' captivity however Bikrama Sain in 1865 Sambat escaped from Kah\u00edlur and reached the fort of Dehr on foot. Sansar Chand now invoked the aid of Ranj\u00edt Singh who seized Kangra in 1868 Sambat. Sird\u00e1r Desa Singh Majithia was appointed his n\u00e1zm\u00ed over the Hill States and he fixed the annual tribute of Suket at Rs. 10,000 but it was shortly raised to Rs. 15,000. In the same year the R\u00e1j\u00e1 levied dhal in his country to collect this tribute. This tax is still levied. The Sikh officials, however, levied Rs. 22,000 instead of Rs. 15,000 from the State. The Mandi people now seized the fort of Tikar k\u00e1 garh but the R\u00e1j\u00e1 induced Isri Sain, the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Mandi, to restore it to him.\n\nOnce R\u00e1na Kesri Singh of Kumh\u00e1rsain detained a woman who was married in Suket and the R\u00e1j\u00e1 ordered the Magr\u00e1 people to arrest him. This was done and he was brought into Suket, but subsequently released on agreeing to pay an annual tribute of Rs. 500.\n\n(1) Hardial's account is that the Mandi R\u00e1j\u00e1 appealed to Kah\u00edlur for aid in regaining the six forts. The R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Kah\u00edlur proposed to bring R\u00e1j\u00e1 Bikrama Sain to Kah\u00edlur through \u00c1blu, his waz\u00edr, who had a bitter grudge against the R\u00e1j\u00e1 (Bikrama Sain) on account of Gorkhan, his brother's murder. Accordingly \u00c1blu beguiled the R\u00e1j\u00e1 to Kah\u00edlur. There the Kah\u00edlur R\u00e1j\u00e1 imprisoned him, in order to compel him to restore Birkot fort and the Bal id\u00e1ga to Mandi which he did. But even then he was not released and waz\u00edr Isu Nand, Tula Ram Bairagi and Bhaj Nand Sarandola carried him off at night, leaving Nalk, his hugga-bardar, in his place.\nThe tribute of Rs. 22,000, which was paid through Mandi, was too heavy a burden for the State to bear. Accordingly Bikrama Sain devised a plan to lessen it without injury to the Mandi R\u00e1j\u00e1. Under this scheme Tika Uggar Sain and Mi\u00e1n Narindar Singh, Kishan Singh's grandson, went to Patiala and thence to Lahore, where they induced the Mahar\u00e1j\u00e1 to allow the tribute to be reduced to Rs. 11,000 and paid direct. In this reign Pali fort was re-built, and that of Dudar erected in order to protect Dh\u00e1r fort after the loss of Birkot. Bikrama Sain, a severe but upright ruler, always punished robbery and trafficking in women with death. In person he was tall and handsome but he was severe and strict. He died in Sambat 1895 after a reign of 47 years. Uggar Sain succeeded him.\n\nA revolt in Kahl\u00far compelled its R\u00e1j\u00e1, Kharag Chand, to borrow Rs. 25,000 from Uggar Sain, his enemy, for its suppression. Uggar Sain endeavoured to reconcile the R\u00e1j\u00e1 and his subjects, but during the negotiations the R\u00e1j\u00e1 died. In 1897 Sambat the Lahore Darb\u00e1r sent a force under Ventura to arrest the rulers of Kahl\u00far, Mandi and Suket, but Uggar Sain saved his State by timely submission, and thus escaped the fate of Balb\u00edr Sain of Mandi and the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Kahl\u00far, whose States were seized by the Sikhs. In 1843 his son Rudar Sain then aged 14 went to Mandi, owing to a disagreement with his father, but R\u00e1j\u00e1 Balb\u00edr Sain effected a reconciliation between them and the Tika was brought back to Suket.\n\nIn 1848 Rudar Sain married a daughter of the Katoch family of Kangra, and towards the end of the same year Narindar Singh, son of Bishen Singh, who had married his daughter by a slave girl to Mahar\u00e1j\u00e1 Sher Singh, made his peace with the Tika and the latter again became estranged from his father. Parohit Devi Dat, Gordhan Kayastha, Mi\u00e1n Kes\u00fa, Th\u00e1kur D\u00e1s Khatri and Tan\u00e1 G\u00edt\u00e1l espoused the Tika's cause as they were supported by the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja. The Tika desired Shib Das' removal, because he had great influence over the R\u00e1j\u00e1, but P\u00e1dha Narotam Adadh\u00e1ri disclosed some papers, written by Gordhan which proved that the Tika's supporters intended to poison the R\u00e1j\u00e1. Narindar Singh being absent the Tika was arrested and Pat, the then Kotw\u00e1li Waz\u00edr, imprisoned Gordhan, Tan\u00e1 P\u00e1dha and Devi Dat, treating them with great severity. Gordhan's house was sacked and Narotam made parohit to the R\u00e1j\u00e1 in his stead. Narindar Singh was also banished and his jagirs confiscated. In Sambat 1906 the Tika sought refuge in Kahl\u00far, but shortly afterwards he was reconciled once again with his father by Mr. G. C. Barnes and returned to Suket. The Waz\u00edr Pat was next arrested and sentenced to a fine of Rs. 10,000, Narotam succeeding to his post. In 1846 R\u00e1j\u00e1 Uggar Sain with other Hill R\u00e1j\u00e1s threw in his lot with the Sikhs, but on their defeat made a secret peace with the English and returned to Suket.\n\nTik\u00e1 Rudar Sain married a daughter of Sudar Sain Shah of Garhw\u00e1l and six months later in 1853 the marriage of Dei S\u00e1rd\u00e1\nto Sohar Singh, R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Chamba, was celebrated with great pomp, contributions being levied from the people of the State to defray its cost. The Tika's third wife was a grand-daughter of Mi\u00e1n Isri Singh of Kahlur. In 1857 the Tika again left Suket, after an attempt to arrest Narotam the Waz\u00edr, whose influence with the R\u00e1j\u00e1 was supreme. The Waz\u00edr, it is said, had fined a Brahman whose fine the R\u00e1j\u00e1 remitted, but the Waz\u00edr enforced its payment. Upon this the Tika and his supporters demanded the Waz\u00edr's arrest, but though the R\u00e1j\u00e1 agreed to it a year and a half elapsed without its being effected and the Tika then went to Hoshi\u00e1rpur, Lahore and Jullundur. Waz\u00edr Pat and Ishria Kayastha, his partisans resisted the Waz\u00edr for 1\u00bd years and then fled to Mandi. In 1859 Bije Sain was married to the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Datarpur's daughter and the Tika then returned to Mandi where, with his r\u00e1n\u00eds of Garhw\u00e1l and Kahl\u00far, he lived in the Gh\u00e1sn\u00fa palace. Disaffection arose among the Suket people and the Tika, declining to return to the State, went to Haripur in Pati\u00e1la, where he was joined by the Kahl\u00far\u00ed r\u00e1n\u00ed who bore him a son in 1863, named Ari Mardan. One year later a daughter, who was eventually married to the Sirm\u00e1r R\u00e1j\u00e1, was born. The Tika's second son Dusht Nikandan was born in 1866. Meanwhile Narotam Waz\u00edr, who was also Waz\u00edr of the Narsinghji temple, had made a new law that widows should be sold and the sale-proceeds credited to the State as usual and that all the property should go to the temple. This custom remained in force as long as he was Waz\u00edr and he also re-built the Durga temple out of the Narsinghji income. Lungu, his deputy, was made administrator of the hill tracts, and when Lungu's elder brother Dhaingal became Waz\u00edr, Narotam was dismissed. The new Waz\u00edr's administration was oppressive. He realized the fines (d\u00e1nd) from innocent people originated in 1910 Sambat on Uggar Sain's accession. When on tour in the hills he was seized by the people of Garh Chaw\u00e1si and incarcerated for 12 days, until released by the R\u00e1j\u00e1's order. In 1919 Sambat the R\u00e1j\u00e1 himself made a tour in the hills and the complaints made resulted in the Waz\u00edr's being fined Rs. 20,000 after 9 months' detention in jail. In 1923 Sambat the R\u00e1j\u00e1's son by a (khaw\u00e1s) Mian Jaw\u00e1l\u00e1 Singh, was married to a Satori daughter of the Mandi R\u00e1j\u00e1 with great pomp. During a hill tour in 1930 Sambat the people were fined Rs. 72,000 and in consequence some fled to Haripur. Lungu Waz\u00edr also fled to Kahl\u00far. Munshi Bansi Lal, once a favourite of the R\u00e1j\u00e1, was caught when on his way to Mandi and imprisoned. R\u00e1j\u00e1 Uggar Sain built the temple to Shiva at Amla Bimla. In 1875 he was seized with paralysis and died in the same year (25 Bhadon, Sambat 1932), respected, in spite of his severity, for his charity, courtesy and courage. He was a good Sanskrit scholar, and well acquainted with medicine and music.\n\nRudar Sain reached Suket from Haripur on 1st Assuj Sambat 1932 (A.D. 1876) and was installed in the same year on 29th of\nCHAP. I. B. Magh. He appointed Dhainkal his Wazir and had the State accounts overhauled by Ramditta Mal. He then went back to Haripur and married the daughter of Jai Singh of Arki. On his return to Suket he imposed a revenue of Rs. 4 to 8 per kh\u00e2r called dh\u00e2l instead of a poll-tax and resumed a s\u00e2san grant of about 540 kh\u00e2rs of land. A year later he made Ramditta Mal his Wazir.\n\nShortly afterwards the revenue was raised from eleven to sixteen rupees per kh\u00e2r; wood for building purposes which formerly had been granted free was now sold. A grazing fee was imposed and other taxes were levied. Dissatisfaction arose and the villagers of Karsog seized the Munsarim Parmeshri Das and applied to the R\u00e2j\u00e2 for redress, who however gave no satisfactory reply. Meanwhile Mi\u00e2n Shib Singh and other Mi\u00e2ns had been banished from the State, the R\u00e2j\u00e2 ascribing the disturbance to their conspiracy. The situation in Suket was becoming serious when Mr. Tremlett, the Commissioner of Jullundur, arrived and commenced enquiries. With the punishments awarded as a result of these enquiries, the R\u00e2j\u00e2 was dissatisfied and left for Lahore.\n\nHe was deposed on 25 Chet Sambat 1935 (A.D. 1879) and after living for sometime in Lahore and Jullundur he finally took up his residence in Hoshiarpur where he died on 2 Maghar Sambat 1944 (1887 A.D.).\n\nAt the time of his deposition his eldest son Ari Mardan Sain was only 15 years old, and accordingly Mi\u00e2ns Shib Singh the brother and Jaggat Singh the uncle of R\u00e2j\u00e2 Rudar Sain were appointed managers. Hardyal Singh, a Kangra Kanungo, was appointed Tehsildar in Bhadon Sambat 1936 and three years later became manager. He was the author of a work in urdu from which much of the history given above has been drawn.\n\nAri Mardan Sain died in Dharmasala 26 Khatak Sambat 1936 and the next heir was his younger brother Dusht Nikandan Sain.\n\nHis Highness R\u00e2j\u00e2 Dusht Nikandan Sain was born on 8 Phagan Sambat 1922 (A.D. 1866), he was installed on the gaddi on 12 Chet Sambat 1936 and was granted full powers on 21 Bisakh Sambat 1943 (A.D. 1886). On 28 Maghar Sambat 1938 he married the daughter of the brother of R\u00e2j\u00e2 Dhian Singh of Bhaggal. His eldest son, Tika Bhim Sain, was born on 13 Maghar Sambat 1942 (A.D. 1885) and his second son Dothain Lachman Singh on 30 Sawan Sambat 1951 (A.D. 1894). Neither is yet betrothed, Tika Bhim Sain is being educated at the Aitchison Chiefs' College, Lahore. Two daughters of the R\u00e2j\u00e2 died in childhood. Mr. Donald was Wazir of the State from 1884 to 1891, and from March 1891 to May 1893, Mr. C. J. Hallifax I.C.S. was manager.\n\nDuring his long reign His Highness R\u00e2j\u00e2 Dusht Nikandan Sain has effected considerable improvements in his State.\nIn 1888 the land revenue assessment was reduced 2\u00bd annas in the rupee in Chaw\u00e1si, Bagr\u00e1h, R\u00e1mgarh and Kaj\u00e1un garhs, and two annas in the rupee in the rest of the State. In 1891 A.D. (Sambat 1947) considerable concessions were granted to Brahmins and Rajputs. A dispensary was opened at Sadr shortly after the R\u00e1ja's accession and a new building has recently been completed.\n\nA school was opened at Bhojpur in 1893; a post office in 1900 and a telegraph office in 1906. His Highness' energy has been largely directed to the construction of public works. The State roads have been maintained in good repair, new palaces, offices, granaries, and sepoy lines have been erected at Buned, and a new jail is approaching completion. The Jeori bridge across the Sutlej was completed in 1889 and a new bridge at Dehr is under contemplation.\n\nThe administration has been improved, unnecessary posts have been abolished and considerable economies have been effected. Under His Highness' personal control, the finances of the State have been strengthened and all debts cleared off.\n\nMany of the old forts are still extant, some being in an excellent state of preservation. On a stone in P\u00e1i fort is an inscription of which the following is a translation:\n\n\"P\u00e1i fort was built on the 12th of 2nd Jeth St. 71 Kh\u00e1n of R\u00e1ja Bikram\u00e1n Sain:\n\nBr\u00e1hmin Agr\u00e1\u20141 | K\u00e1hn\u00e1 Jaim\u00e1l\u20141\nPalsr\u00e1 Paremon\u20141 | Koth\u00e1l\u00e1 Doglu\u20141\n\nSection C\u2014Population.\n\nSuket with a density of total population on total area of 1,133 persons to the square mile stands 11th among the Punjab Native States (the Simla Hill States being taken as one). The cultivated area of the State not being known the actual pressure of the population on soil cannot be ascertained; but undoubtedly the country is more sparsely peopled than the adjoining District of K\u00e1ngra or the State of Mandi.\n\nThe State contains two towns and 28 villages. The population of the former is given in the margin. Treated as one (Suket) in the census of 1891, their joint population rose by 38 per cent. in 1891-1901. Only 4 per cent. of the population live in these towns. The number of villages as given at each census is noted in the margin. In 1881 and 1891 each hamlet (b\u00e1s) which is not an administrative unit but forms part of a group of hamlets bearing some resemblance to the village community of the plains and known as garh or 'fort' was taken as a separate village, while in 1901 each garh was so treated. As to the types of village the remarks in the K\u00e1ngra Gazetteer apply to this State.\nTable 6 of Part B shows the population of the State as it stood at the three enumerations of 1881, 1891 and 1901. In the 1881-1891 decade there was a decrease of 2 per cent., which was discussed by Mr. Maclagan as follows:\n\n\"It is probable that this is partly due to bad enumeration, as the census was taken just at the time when a formal enquiry was being made into the Raja's administration and the whole machinery of Government was in disorder, but the census of 1881 was taken during the visit of Raja of Mandi who had come to be married and had brought with him a very large following, and in 1891, previously to the enumeration, a considerable number of Suketis had left the State to take up forest labour in Mandi and elsewhere.\"\n\nIn the 1891-1901 decade the increase was 4.3 per cent.\n\nThe following table shows the effect of migration on the population of the Suket State according to census of 1901:\n\n| IMMIGRANTS | Persons | Males | Females |\n|------------|---------|-------|---------|\n| 1. From within the Punjab and North-West Frontier Province | 3,834 | 1,935 | 1,899 |\n| 2. From the rest of India | 195 | 120 | 75 |\n| 3. From the rest of Asia | 24 | 20 | 4 |\n| 4.

Important though less numerous castes are Rajputs and Bohras.\n\n| Kanets | ... | 22,798 |\n|--------|-----|--------|\n| Brahmin| ... | 12,261 |\n| Koli   | ... | 8,714  |\n| Chamal | ... | 2,929  |\n| Damma  | ... | 2,894  |\n| Chanal | ... | 1,668  |\n| Rajput | ... | 1,184  |\n| Bohra  | ... | 615    |\n\nThere is a mixed caste called Thakar which is said to be composed of the offspring of mixed marriages between Rajputs and Kanets. A few claim to be pure Rajputs and wear the janeo.\n\nThe Kanets form the mass of the agricultural community; they perform all kinds of agricultural work with their own hands, and are assisted by their women who observe no purdah. The two main classes, Khasia and Rahu, are not clearly distinguished, the majority call themselves Rahu, leaving the wealthier few to style themselves Khasia. Neither class wears the janeo though both observe the 13 days' funeral rites (Kiria karm). There appear to be no distinctions within the caste preventing inter-marriage. A Kanet will gladly take a wife from a higher caste (e.g., Rajput), the offspring being Kanets. If a Kanet marries a woman of a lower caste he descends to that caste. The morality of the Kanet woman is a matter of notoriety, as long as she is somehow attached to a man she seems to care little as to the nature of the relationship.\n\nThe Rajputs are represented by comparatively few families, the principal are Bansia, Manhans, Goleria, Pahrar, Maila, Lohukkria, Thaker and Tandola, the first three come highest in the order named. Each family must marry its daughters into a higher family, and as there is no family higher than Bansia in the State, its members have to go far afield for bridegrooms. This suggests the practice of female infanticide but there are no figures to support it.\n\nThe three higher families and some of the Pahrar will not put their hands to the plough but the remainder do; the three last named families do not wear the janeo. All the above will eat kachchi food together, but one will only eat pakki food of his own or of a higher family. None of the families practise widow remarriage, nor do they follow the local custom of divorce. An unfaithful wife is informally discarded and not, as amongst other castes, sold to the paramour. All Rajputs are exempt from beg\u00e1r.\n\nThe Brahmins of Suket are roughly divisible into three classes: the first claim descent from those who accompanied Bir Sain from Bengal; these are pure Gaur Brahmins and abstain from labour. The largest number of these is to be found at Naggar, the old capital: a few possess mu\u00e1fs or s\u00e1san; most are parohits.\nThe second class are Sarsut Brahmins, descendants of the original inhabitants of Suket; some of these have intermixed with the Gaurs and observe the same strictness of caste.\n\nThe third class is composed of the majority of the Sarsut Brahmins who plough and labour and are generally little distinguishable from ordinary agriculturists; all Brahmins are exempt from beg\u00e1r.\n\nDagis and Kolis form the lowest class of agriculturists, they do not differ from members of the same tribes in the neighbouring districts.\n\nThe annexed pedigree table of the descendants of R\u00e1ja Bikram Sain shows the relationship of the Mians to the ruling chief; most of these enjoy small j\u00e1girs.\n\n**BIKRAM SAIN.**\n\n```\nUggar Sain.

The family is Gaur Brahmin and is represented to-day by Fithu.\n\nThe mass of the people are Hind\u00fas, but beyond wearing the choti and carrying out the Hind\u00fa ceremonials on the occasions of births, marriages and deaths, they know little of the orthodox Hinduism of the plains.\n\nTheir religion chiefly consists in worship of the village deota; one or more of these is to be found in every village, each has its own temple of wood or stone, its own pujaris (professional worshipper and attendant) and its own annual fair, and nearly all have a small plot of land of which the income is mu\u00e1f to the deota. Each temple is managed by a k\u00e1rd\u00e1r appointed by the R\u00e1ja who also exercises a general supervision over the income and expenditure.\nSuket has hitherto remained free from religious sects and schisms; it contains no branch of any Samaj or Sabha within its borders.\n\nThere is no Christian Mission stationed in Suket, but a member of the Church Missionary Society usually visits the State at least once a year at the time of the Nalwari fair.\n\nThere are but few Musalmans in the State, the only Musalman village is Dograin in Balh which is inhabited by Arains.\n\nThe following account of certain temples and forms of worship has been compiled by the State officials.\n\nIn the town of Nagar, Tahsil Balh, there is a pakka-built temple, dedicated to Narsingji. Nearly 145 ghumaos of land are attached to it as jagir. Sadabart is kept up from the income of this jagir, and presents from devotees are also accepted. The pujaris and the kardars of the sadabart are paid from the income of the jagir. Inside the temple is an idol of Pakhan, like the idol of Sagarmani found in temples in the Punjab. This idol is kept locked up in a box, of which the keys are entrusted to the pujari. There is a narrow hole in the Murti Pakhan, and any one desirous of seeing the idol closes one eye and peeps through the hole with the other to see the dreadful appearance of Narsingji. It is said that those who see it are exposed to danger. The pujari who waits upon it bathes and feeds it daily with eyes closed and face averted. As a rule no one can see Narsingji, but if any one wishes to do so, he has to get permission from the State. It is said that a sadhu, who was going to Manikarn, getting permission from the State, saw Narsingji, and consequently died, and that once thieves made away with certain ornaments from the temple but were struck blind at a short distance from it, and arrested.\n\nOn the third of the shukla paksh, or bright fortnight during which the moon rises at night-fall, in the month of Bhadon, Hindu females observe the chirya ka barat which is a kind of fast. On that day they eat no food which has been prepared on a hearth, and no plantains, but they may take milk and any other fruit. Five sparrows of silver and 20 or 25 of earth are prepared. The former are clothed and decorated with silver ornaments, a gold balu, 'nose-ring,' being put on the beak of each one. These silver sparrows are distributed among Brahmins, while the images made of earth are given to children. A feast is also given to 15 or 16 Brahmins. Women observe this fast to ensure long life to their husbands. They also listen to a katha (a sacred narrative which is recited by a Brahmin, and of which the following is the substance):\n\nIn early life Parbati, wife of Sheo Ji, spent 12 years in devotion to God. She also observed the chirya barat, in consequence of which she obtained Sheoji as her husband. Following her example\non the advice of Brahmins, the females of this part have observed this bar\u0101t from ancient times.\n\nThe temple of Mah\u0101deo lies one mile north of Nagar town, in Ballh Tahsil. It is a stone building and the pindi (the upper part of Shiva Ling) of Mah\u0101deo in it is made of black stone, nearly one span in height and about two feet in circumference.\n\nThe puj\u0101ris employed in the temple belong to the Kondal g\u00f4t of the Gaur Brahmins, and are called R\u0101wals by the Hind\u016bs, because whenever a Hindu dies his relations make him give something, such as a cow, silver, gold, grain, etc., as alms before he expires, and the gift is, on his death, appropriated by these puj\u0101ris who take even the shroud that covers the corpse. They aver that their forefathers came with the ancestors of the rulers of Suket from Bengal and the temple and its pindi already existed there. The story about the temple's foundation as told by their forefathers was that it was built in a single night by the order of a certain R\u0101ja of the P\u0101ndavas. The building, as it now exists, and the forms of the pillar and pindi of Mah\u0101deo clearly shew them to have been made in very ancient times, but the date and year of its foundation are not known.\n\nThe place on which the pindi stands has a great natural rock under it, out of which the pindi has been carved. The fret-work round the pindi is also of stone, and the floor all round it is paved with stones, while four large and four small columns of black stone rise from on this pavement. The roof supported by these columns is so built that it is divided into small separate parts furnished with stone slabs.\n\nThe story as to the origin of the worship of the pindi is this, that formerly the site which it now occupies was a mere jungal and entirely remote from all habitations. A certain Jat had a milch cow, which, when he tried to milk her, yielded nothing. The Jat, anxious to find out the cause, made enquiry and found that the cow used to go to the pindi of Mah\u0101deo, and standing over it give it milk from her udders. Since then the people have cherished a belief in it and worshipped it.\n\nThe management of the temple and the land attached to it rests with the puj\u0101ris, of whom there are five houses, each of which in turn performs worship and the other duties of the temple and receives the offerings.\n\nIn performing worship the puj\u0101ri on duty goes to a jungle early in the morning, and thence fetches flowers and bil-teri or leaves of the bil tree. He also collects rice, etc., and then commences worship which takes him some three hours, until the sun has risen a pahar, in this wise:\n\nFirst he washes the pindi of Mah\u0101deo with ordinary water and then with Ganges water. Then offers it sandal, achhi or rice, dh\u016bp-d\u012bp or incense, nairved or sweets and flowers. Lastly, the\nbil-patri leaves, strung together in threes, are offered to it. This last is considered the most beneficial offering. The offering of water is also regarded as a good act. During the worship the townspeople also assemble to pay their devotions to the pindi. After the worship, arti is performed with camphor, while the pujaris and pandits sing hymns. Meanwhile the other people, both men and women, boys and girls, throw water over the pindi, ring the bell, and finally prostrating themselves before the image return home. This continues till mid-day. In the evening the pujaris again perform arti. According to the Hindu religion to visit (darshan karna) the shiv-ling (the pindi or ling of Mahadeo) at evening, to offer water, flowers and til-teri to it and to light a lamp before it, is considered a very virtuous deed which makes amends for the sins of all past transmigrations.\n\nThe restrictions in connection with the pindi are that no Hindus, except the pujaris, may eat the offerings (parshad) made to it, and that none of them may cross the stream of water, which proceeds from the pindi when he goes round the pindi. This stream of water is believed to be Parbati, the wife of Siva. The parshad is not eaten because it is believed that: kach\u00e1 p\u00e1ra Barham is Shiv nirmail jo kh\u00e1e, kahe Mah\u00e1deo sun Parbati jaran m\u00fal se j\u00e1e, that is \"whosoever does so will be utterly ruined.\" The duties of cleaning the temple and supplying water are also carried out by the pujari on duty. It has not, however, been ascertained how and since when the connection of the pujaris with the temple commenced, but the present pujaris state that when their forefathers left Bengal and came to Suket with the ancestors of its rulers the then Raja appointed them to the office of pujari, and that since then they have performed its worship in succession. Inside the temple, the pujaris also use charas and bhang. The income accruing from the land attached to the temple is spent in defraying the cost of Shiv-ji's bhog, etc., which is divided by the pujaris among themselves. But if any abhyagat or begging sadhu appears at the time, he is also given his meed of bhog. A lamp is lit both morning and evening at the times of worship. The offerings made consist of cocoanuts, fruits and rot (a coarse bread) which are appropriated by the pujaris. Two fairs are held annually, namely:\u2014(1). The first on the Shivratri in February, on which day Hind\u00e1s, men, women and children fast, and worship Shiv-ji in the temple in the daytime. During the night a jagr\u00e1n or vigil is observed. Pandits well versed in theology conduct the worship. Four services are held, one in each of the four divisions of the night, each lasting one pahar or 3 hours, so that two are concluded by midnight.\n\nThe first is performed as described above. After the first the samangri (odorous articles) and water offered at the commencement of the worship are thrown with due respect into the stream, and the pindi and temple are washed with water.\n(2) Same only by midnight.\n\nThe arti is performed at the end of each worship, and the Pandits, forming themselves into companies of four or five each, recite verses from the Pothi-Mihman in chorus. Hind\u00fas contribute to the s\u0101mangri according to their means, and a worshipper to please Siva imitates the voice of a he-goat: the following story from Pothi Shiv-Par\u00e1n is told to explain why this is done:\n\n\"R\u00e1ja Dakchha Parj\u00e1 Pati, father of P\u00e1rbati, the wife of Siva, celebrated a jag at this place. Considering Siva, his son-in-law, an amang\u00e1l or inauspicious man haunted by demons and spirits, he did not invite him to take part in the jag. P\u00e1rbati his daughter was much distressed at this and complained to Siva against her father. The jag (yag) had not been finished, when Siva cut off the R\u00e1ja's head. As the jag had not been completed all the gods assembled and begged Siva to bring the R\u00e1ja to life again. Their request being granted, he placed the head of a he-goat on the R\u00e1ja's headless body and he began to bleat like a he-goat to the great delight of Siva.\"\n\nThis temple is in Nagar town. The building is of pakka masonry. The story about its origin is that about 250 years ago, a Bair\u00e1gi faq\u00edr came here from Jagan N\u00e1th on the coast of Orissa. He had an idol of Jagan N\u00e1th made of sandal wood, and the Suket Court hearing that he wished to sell it offered him Rs. 500 for it, but he refused the offer, saying that he was taking the idol to Kull\u00fa, the R\u00e1ja of which had promised him Rs. 1,000. By chance the faq\u00edr died before he could set out for Kull\u00fa, and consequently the idol was by the R\u00e1ja's order placed in the buildings previously used as a seraglio. He appointed puj\u00e1ris to the temple and granted land for its maintenance, spending Rs. 500, the price of the idol, on the funeral ceremonies of the Bair\u00e1gi and built the temple at State expense.\n\nEndeavours have been made to ascertain the date of the foundation of the temple without success. The largest idol is that of Jagan N\u00e1th, which is a cubit in height. The nose, mouth, eyes and the hands without fingers, are visible in it. At its right side is an idol of Balbdhar, and at its left one of Lakhshmi. There are also other small idols, of S\u00e1lig R\u00e1m, etc., in the temple. Its management is carried on by puj\u00e1ris who belong to the Kondal g\u00f3t of the Brahmins and possess only one house in the State. With the exception of the puj\u00e1ris, nobody may work in the temple. The bhog offered to Jagan N\u00e1th consists of rice, pulse, etc.; parsh\u00e1d is also distributed. The cost of the bhog is defrayed from the income accruing from the land granted by the State for the maintenance of the temple. On the second of As\u00e1r Sudi (the date on which the fair is held at Jagan N\u00e1th in Orissa) a fair is held here. A brief account of it is given below:\n\n\"Jagan N\u00e1th is supposed to become angry (with his wife) in consequence of some misunderstanding. The puj\u00e1ris are unable to explain how the...\"\nCHAP. I. C.\n\nquarrel arose beyond saying that this is an imitation of what is done at the temple of Jagan N\u00e1th in Orissa. The puj\u00e1ris and others assemble, put the idol in a palanquin and take it to the Jamg\u00e1 garden on the Ghangal Khad one mile from the town, and stay there for a day. Food is prepared in the garden and served to those who accompany the procession or arrive during the day. There is an idol of Ram Chandra in the garden, and Jagan N\u00e1th pays a visit to it, cardamums and nuts being distributed. On the third day, Lakhshmi, the wife of Jagan N\u00e1th, goes to the garden and is reconciled with Jagan N\u00e1th.\"\n\nThe idol is then brought back and placed in its temple where \u00e1rti is performed. When Jagan N\u00e1th is taken to the Jamg\u00e1 garden, the procession is attended by the State officials, elephants and horses forming the retinue. Other people, with drums, flags and p\u00e1lkis, etc., also join it. The idol is brought back in full retinue. Sometimes, His Highness the R\u00e1ja also graces the procession with his presence while going to the garden and back. About 400 people attend the procession.\n\nThe temple known as Suraj Kund is situated near the capital, at the foot of a hill on the bank of a ravine. The courtyard is paved with stones, and towards the west of it stands the temple building which is of stone. In front of the temple door is a masonry tank (kund), $25 \\times 25$ feet, which adds to the beauty of the temple.\n\nThe temple and tank are surrounded by houses of wood and pakka masonry built by the State for the convenience of travellers, and s\u00e1dhus visit it on pilgrimages to Manikarn and other sacred places. The following office-bearers are appointed to the temple and its lands attached thereto:\n\nPuj\u00e1ri, Kath\u00e1l\u00e1, Jeltha, Bik\u00e1ri, K\u00e1 d\u00e1\u00ed and Farrash.\n\nThe area of the lands is about 30 kh\u00e1s yielding an income of about Rs. 700 a year, out of which the office-bearers are paid.\n\nSadd\u00e1ba-t or perpetual distribution of food is made in the temple, the cost being also met from this income. The poor, travellers and tirathbashis or pilgrims receive food at this sadd\u00e1b\u00e1rt. If the expenses exceed the income, the State lends its help.\n\nThe puj\u00e1ri worships, prepares food for and offers it to Surajji (the idol of the sun) both mornings and evening, and performs the \u00e1rti which consists in taking a sacred light in his hand and waving it round the idol whose praises he recites. He is a Brahmin of the State.\n\nThe kath\u00e1l\u00e1 is the custodian of the temple. The grain yielded by its lands is in his charge and is disposed of through him.\n\nThe jeltha only realizes produce from the tenants and executes orders issued to him.\n\nThe far\u00e1sh performs the work of sweeping. The bik\u00e1ri renders services connected with the preparation of food.\nThe k\u0101rd\u0101r keeps an account and produces a statement of daily income and expenses to His Highness the R\u0101ja S\u0101hib.\n\nThe income of the soap-wort (sapindus saponaria) trees, which stand in the ravine, is also included in the income of the temple. Inside the temple there is an idol of Suraj ji weighing about 36 pakka sers made of eight metals. It is of human form but has four hands. It is flanked by 2 brass horses, each one balisht in height, thus giving the whole image the appearance of a chariot.\n\nIt is surrounded by several other idols of stone which represent Krishna, R\u0101dh\u0101, R\u0101m, Balram, Hanum\u0101n, etc. It is said that the idol was made in the State by the brass-workers of Chir\u0101gh village. Affixed to the wall of the temple is a large piece of stone which bears an inscription, which runs:\n\nIn the name of the deity Ganesh.\n\nOn the 28th As\u0101r st. 1782, B. Mahar\u0101ja Gharur Chand and Siri Rani Panchmon Dei commenced to build the Suraj Kund temple in order to place the idol of the Sun there.\n\nThe building was completed and the idol of the Sun placed in the temple on the 23rd Bais\u0101kh st. 1785 A.B. He did so for religious purposes.\n\nOn all four sides of the temple is a grove of lofty soap-wort trees. As s\u0101dhus and pilgrims live in the temple, it is well known in far off countries. No mela (fair) takes place in connection with this temple. Hindus make obeisance to the idol.\n\nThe people arise at sunrise (bih\u0101g) and partake of a light meal (nih\u0101r\u012b) composed of the remains of the previous day's food. The first big meal (kulw\u0101r) is eaten about 10 or 11 a.m.; another meal (dopahri) is eaten shortly after midday, and the evening meal (biyali) is eaten after sunset.\n\nThe ordinary earthen deva (sinjia) is used with a cotton wick and oil of mustard or taramira, or sometimes an oil expressed from the seeds of bhang, called bhangoli, or sometimes oil (gluti ka tel) expressed from the apricot. This latter is more usually used as a food. Torches of chil are used in the hills.\n\nThe ordinary zamindar performs no daily worship beyond perhaps fixing a mark (tikka) to his forehead.\n\nSpring (April to June) is the season for village fairs.\n\nWrestling matches are popular, they are usually given on occasions of rejoicing or by some one who has gained some special object or completed some particular task. The wrestlers are usually local Gujars or Jats, though on great occasions, skilled performers from the plains may be engaged. The people themselves take no part in these exercises but prefer to look on.\n\nGambling, though general in the bazars, is not usual in the villages.\nThe men plough and sow the fields and prepare the woollen thread for weaving; much of their time is occupied in giving begur, watching their crops, and repairing houses and walls, &c.\n\nThe women cook, smash the clods left after ploughing, and do the major part of the reaping, they also milk the cows, make the ghi and perform the various household duties.\n\nThe children take the cattle, sheep and goats to graze and generally assist their parents wherever possible.\n\nChupattis of buckwheat (kodra), maize (challi) and wheat eaten with butter milk form the chief food. Vegetables such as green bhang, mash, kulth, chola, chanua and massar are eaten when in season. Flesh is eaten by all when obtainable, but most are too poor to afford it. The rice, grown locally, is usually sold and is seldom eaten except on the occasion of marriages, &c. Lugri (hill beer) is drunk on festive occasions. Pakki food (food cooked with ghi) is beyond the means of the majority.\n\nIn the Balh and lower valleys cotton clothes and leather shoes are usually worn, as in the plains; the puggari is usually replaced by a small round cotton cap.\n\nIn the hills the clothes worn are woollen:\u2014pyjamas, coat and dohrn or puttu over the shoulders. A long coat (jaggi) tied by a belt (gachi) of cotton cloth is common. The poor wear the shela, a double fold of coarse goats hair cloth, with a hole for the head.\n\nThe women in Balh wear the costume usual in the plains, flowing pyjamas and a brilliantly coloured fluted skirt. In the hills they wear a jaggi and puttu.\n\nIn Balh the houses are usually made with mud walls and a sloping thatched roof; in the hills more substantial buildings of stone and timber bonds with slates of chil wood are found; these have two or more storeys, in the lowest of which are stored the cattle, &c. In Balh the cowhouse is separate (goain).\n\nEach village deota has its own fair, but none of these are important.\n\nThere is a big cattle fair known as Nalwara held between Band and Nagar about the end of March. It is described in Chapter II.\n\nIn Assu (September) is held the Bantra fair at Suket. Parties of dancers wearing strange costumes perform in front of the Raja\u2019s palace.\n\nOne party is provided with clothes by the Raja, another by the Tahsil amla and so on.\nCHAPTER II.\u2014ECONOMIC.\n\nSection A.\u2014Agriculture.\n\nThe greater part of the area of the State is composed of steep hills and narrow valleys, the fields are on steep slopes, sometimes irregularly placed, sometimes neatly levelled and built up into terraces. On the western border lies the fertile level plain of Balh, plentifully irrigated by the Suk-ti stream; this is bounded by gently rising hills covered with terraced fields. Further eastwards is the hilly tract of Tahsil Karsog where the slopes are generally too steep to be terraced; but within this tract are two wide vales at Karsog and Pangna containing some of the richest land in Suket. Along the bank of the Sutlej are patches of rich and level land bounding the beds of the feeder streams.\n\nThe rainfall is usually plentiful; no record is kept, but it may be roughly estimated at 50 inches a year. The soil is usually light but much mixed with stones in the hill tract.\n\nThree kinds of land are recognised\u2014\n\nRopa\u2014Level irrigated land.\n\nBohokhal (Bobotl)\u2014Unirrigated land, sometimes terraced, more generally sloping.\n\nBanjar\u2014Poor unirrigated land in the high hills only fit for grass and buckwheat.\n\nNearly the whole of the cultivated land is bohokhal; ropa is almost confined to Balh, Karsog, Pangna and Farenu.\n\nRopa is double cropped only in Balh where the land is said to be decreasing in fertility on this account. Generally this is reserved for rice in the kharif; if used for a rabi crop, wheat and occasionally tobacco are sown.\n\nOn bohokhal land the main kharif crops are maize, m\u00e1sh, kulth, kodra, bressa, kat\u00fa, and, on bad land, kangni; the rabi crops are wheat, chola, massar, barley and a little sugarcane and cotton. Potatoes are grown in the hills and sold in Simla, Bashahr or Suket.\n\nThere is a small State tea garden at Buned.\n\nOpium poppy is grown in the hills; no permission is required for cultivation and no fees are charged, but the opium must be sold only to the State contractor at a rate fixed by the R\u00e1ja. The annual outturn of opium is roughly estimated at 8 maunds pakka.\n\nFor the cultivation of rice, there are usually three preliminary ploughings followed by the final one when the seed is sown broadcast. About three or four weeks later, the young shoots are worked over with a harrow (dandr\u00e1l), and when the stalk is about\na foot high the field is ploughed up and a flat block of wood (m\u00e1hi or mih\u00e1n) is drawn over it. The weeds and grass are thus killed and the rice plants rapidly rise up.\n\nThe account of other crops given in the Mandi Gazetteer applies to Suket and little need be added.\n\nNo systematic attempt has been made to record the actual yield of various crops. The following tables are based upon rough estimates. Average yield in maunds pakka per kh\u00e1r of land:\n\n| Tahsil | Ropa | Bohokhal |\n|--------|------|----------|\n| Maize  | Balh | 36 to 56 maunds | 20 to 24 maunds |\n|        | Karsog | Not sown | 40 to 80 |\n| Wheat  | Balh | 50 to 72 maunds | 19 to 29 |\n|        | Karsog | Not sown | 36 to 72 |\n| Rice   | Balh | 50 to 72 maunds | 24 to 40 |\n|        | Karsog | 25 to 36 maunds | Not sown |\n| Kodra  | Balh | Not sown | 35 to 50 maunds |\n|        | Karsog | Not sown | 36 to 72 |\n\nAmount of seed used per kh\u00e1r of land\u2014\n\n| Tahsil | Rops | Bohokhal |\n|--------|------|----------|\n| Maize  | Balh | 20 sers pakka | 20 sers |\n|        | Karsog | Not sown | 50 |\n| Wheat  | Balh | 130 sers | 140 |\n|        | Karsog | Not sown | 160 |\n| Rice   | Balh | 144 sers | 100 |\n|        | Karsog | 160 sers | Not sown |\n| Kodra  | Balh | Not sown | 10 sers |\n|        | Karsog | Not sown | 40 |\n\nPractically the whole population is engaged in, and is dependent upon, agriculture; there are no large towns and there are no industries. The holdings are small and tenants and labourers are few.\nExtension of cultivation is provided for by the grant of nautor leases; the whole of the waste belongs to the State and cannot be broken up for cultivation without the consent of the R\u00e1ja.\n\nPermission is usually accorded if there be no objectors; the full revenue rate is charged from the date of the lease.\n\nThe annual increase of revenue from this source is about Rs. 500.\n\nAgriculture is in a primitive condition, and there is no attempt made to improve it.\n\nThe R\u00e1ja advances loans on special occasions, such as an epidemic of cattle disease, or for special works, such as a new irrigation channel.\n\nThere are no figures available for mortgages and sales. The R\u00e1ja is superior proprietor of all the land, and no one can sell or mortgage without his consent. Application for permission to alienate must be made to the R\u00e1ja who accords his sanction only when the necessity is clearly demonstrated.\n\nSuch applications are few; only collateral mortgages are allowed and foreclosure is practically unknown.\n\nLoans are usually obtained on a simple bond, bearing compound interest at the rate of three pies per rupee per month; the period of limitation is fifteen years, but the courts do not generally award as interest a sum exceeding half the principal.\n\nRegarding the cattle of the State Major Pease,(1) C. V. D., writes as follows:\n\nSuket breed of cattle is one of the best met with in the Himalayas. These cattle are found in the State, and are much prized on account of their superior size and weight, as also for their milking powers, in Kull\u00fa, where large numbers are to be seen. They differ from the other breeds seen in the Himalayas in general conformation. Some of the cows are really handsome little beasts and very good milkers. The skins are fine; hair smooth; ears long but finer and more or less horizontal in direction; head fine, well shaped and breedly looking; neck light; hump hardly breaking the line of the back in the female, but more developed in the male; back straight; dewlap small; quarter not very sloping, but short; loins broad and well formed; tail fine; and having a tuft of black hair at the end reaching to mid-metatarsal region. The head in this breed is very characteristic, the face unusually long and small, straight from poll to muzzle, measuring generally about 16 inches, the orbital arches rise above the level of frontal bone considerably, thus giving the forehead a depressed appearance, the breadth between the orbits is four to five inches. The horns usually arch upwards and measure from a few inches to about a foot in length. The colours are generally even; many red, some black and a few white and dun. The mammary gland is fairly developed, teats small. Sheath of male badly developed and finished off with a few long hairs.\n\nCows yield from 1\u00bd sers to 4 seers pakka of milk a day; this is of good quality, yielding 1\u00bd ounces of ghi per ser.\n\n(1) From Vety. Capt. Baldrey's Breeds of Indian Cattle, Punjab; p. 190.\nThe price varies from Rs. 10 to Rs. 20 according to the age and the yield of milk. Oxen vary in price from Rs. 10 to Rs. 14 in the hill tracts where the breed is small; and from Rs. 30 to Rs. 50 in the Balh where they are larger.\n\nBuffaloes yield 3 to 6 sers pakka milk and sell for Rs. 60 or Rs. 70, males are little used except for sugarcane pressing and hence are usually sold; the price obtained is Rs. 15 or Rs. 20.\n\nSheep are worth Rs. 2 to Rs. 2-8-0; they are shorn three times a year in Jeth, Khatak and Phagan; each sheep yields about one ser pakka of wool per year.\n\nGoats are kept for manure, the hair is used to make a coarse cloth or little floor mats (shela). Their price is the same as that of a sheep.\n\nThere are few ponies in Balh and none in Karsog. There is no veterinary establishment.\n\nThe waste belongs to the State, but the people are allowed to graze their cattle over it, and there is no scarcity of fodder. In return the State collects dues; in Karsog each house pays one ser kachcha of ghi annually; in Balh for each buffalo that calves, the owner pays 4 or 5 sers pakka of ghi. This is known as k\u0101r chompri. On sheep and goats a tax (g\u016bn\u0101keri) of Rs. 2 to Rs. 4 per hundred is levied. Besides the above for each pony, camel or mule passing through the State, a grazing fee of two annas is collected.\n\nEvery year about the end of March, the Nalw\u0101ra cattle fair is held at the capital, about 5,000 or 6,000 animals are brought, and of these 1,500 to 2,000 change hands. On each buffalo sold a fee of eight annas is charged and credited to the Theka Zag\u0101t; nothing is levied on cows. Purchasers attend in large numbers from Kangra and to a less extent from Mandi, Bilaspur and Kull\u016b.\n\nThere are no irrigation wells in the State. There are a few channel (kuhls) in Balh and Karsog and along the Sutlej bank. Those in Balh belong to the State which appoints a kuhli h\u0101la to look after each kuhl; this official is paid by a grant of grain and revenue free land. Lands actually irrigated are charged a special rate (sagahi) of 5 lakhs rice in the kharif and 2\u00bd lakhs wheat in the rabi per kh\u0101r. This is collected in kind.\n\nIn Karsog the people own and manage their own kuhls, and no separate water-rate is levied.\n\nThe unit of weight is a sarsai, equivalent to about two tolas.\n\n| Weight       | Equivalent |\n|--------------|------------|\n| 2 Sarsais    | \u00bd pao      |\n| 4            | 1 pao      |\n| 8            | \u00bc ser kachcha |\n| 16           | 1 ser kachcha |\n| 8 sers kachcha | 1 batti or panseri |\n| 10           | 1 dhari    |\n| 40           | 1 maund kachcha |\n\nOne maund kachcha is equivalent to 16 sers pakka.\nFor grain an iron measure known as a patha is used.\n\n\\[20 \\text{ pathas} = 1 \\text{ lakh}\\]\n\\[20 \\text{ lakhs} = 1 \\text{ kh\u00e1r}\\]\n\nA patha contains 4 sers kachcha of wheat, rice, mash and maize, and 3 sers kachcha of kodra, kangni, barley and mustard.\n\nIn Karsog the patha contains 6 sers kachcha of wheat, rice, &c., and 5 sers kachcha of kodra, &c.\n\nFor land, the seed measure is used; in Balh and Dehr the unit is the kh\u00e1r; in Karsog the unit is a takka, 16 takkas compose one rupee, and one rupee is roughly equivalent to a kh\u00e1r. The kh\u00e1r seems to vary between 6 and 8 acres.\n\n---\n\n**Section B.\u2014Rents, Wages and Prices.**\n\nThe holdings are nearly all small and are cultivated by their owners; tenants are few; those working on the Mians' jagirs pay about revenue rates. Rents are either a fixed sum in cash or a fixed contribution of grain; the former which are preferred by the people are found in Karsog and vary between Rs. 16 per kh\u00e1r on better class land and Rs. 13-8-0 on hill tracts. The grain rents vary from a kh\u00e1r of grain on a kh\u00e1r of good land (about 12 maunds pakka of rice on 13 bighas rice land) to 12 or 15 lakhs on a kh\u00e1r of poor land. The State prefers rents in kind as grain is required to feed beg\u00e1ris.\n\nThere are few, if any, agricultural labourers; when work presses, the people help each other.\n\nThe ordinary rate for a cooli is four annas a day, or a rupee for five days. The State pays two annas a day. Skilled labour earns 2\u00bd annas a day and food. The thawi (lohar, and carpenter) gets 4 annas and one meal in the bazaars, in the hills he gets 2 or 3 annas and two meals a day.\n\nThe skins of dead cattle belong to the State. Brahmins and Rajputs are now allowed to dispose of their own skins, but in all other cases the State claims them. The contract (jins\u00e1l) is auctioned every year for about Rs. 2,500, the contractor appoints one chamar for every fifteen or twenty houses; this chamar is entitled to the skins of all dead animals from the houses allotted to him, and in return pays Rs. 6 per year to the contractor and gives either a pair of shoes or ten annas in cash to the owner of the dead animal.\n\nThe payments made to village artisans at harvest time are as follows:\n\nThe chamar in the Balh Tahsil gets 12 pathas of wheat and one bundle (about 5 pathas) at rabi, and 24 pathas of rice and one bundle (about 10 pathas) at kharif.\nIn Karsog he receives 16 pathas of wheat and one lakh of barley at rabi, and 16 pathas of bithu or kodra at kharif.\n\nIn return for this he provides, in Balh, shoes for one year's use for one member of the family, and repairs all the shoes of the family. He also makes and repairs harness. In Karsog he provides one pair of shoes a year for each member of the family.\n\nThe lohar in Balh receives six pathas of wheat and 1\u00bd bundles (about 7\u00bd pathas) at rabi and 12 pathas of rice and six bundles (about 30 pathas) at kharif. In Karsog he receives 8 pathas of wheat and 8 pathas of barley at rabi and 8 pathas of kodra or bithu at kharif.\n\nIn return he makes all agricultural implements, providing his own charcoal. The zemindar provides the iron.\n\nThe kamhar in Balh receives 6 pathas of wheat at rabi and 12 pathas of rice at kharif and 5 pathas of wheat, and 5 pathas of barley at rabi, and 5 pathas of kodra or kangni at kharif in Karsog.\n\nIn return he gives dishes and pots according to the zemindar's requirements.\n\nThe State issues a price list annually which serves as a table of exchange to estimate the value of the State reserves of grain; this is not binding in the bazaars, but it is closely adhered to especially in Karsog.\n\nThe prices obtained for his produce by the zemindar from the shopkeepers vary, but the following table will serve as a rough indication of present rates in pakka sers per rupee:\n\n|        | Karsog       | Balh         |\n|--------|--------------|--------------|\n| Maize  | 32 to 36 sers| 1 maund     |\n| Wheat  | 20 to 24 ,,  | 28 to 30 sers|\n| Rice   | 22 to 26 ,,  | 30 to 32 ,,  |\n| Kodra  | 26 to 30 ,,  | 48 ,,        |\n\nKodra is not purchased to any extent by the shopkeepers as there is no market for it.\n\nThe average State price list for the last five years is as follows:\n\n|        | Balh       | Karsog    | Dehr      |\n|--------|------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Maize  | 30 seers   | 35 seers  | 34 seers  |\n| Wheat  | 21 ,,      | 20 ,,     | 18 ,,     |\n| Rice   | 22 to 26 seers | 14 ,, | 22 to 27 ,, |\n| Kodra  | 37 ,,      | 32 ,,     | 38 ,,     |\n\nThe people generally are poor, but their needs are few and habits of waste or luxury are nowhere prevalent. The system of land tenure discourages and almost entirely prevents extravagance; while the situation of their homes scattered over a hilly tracts allows little opportunity for expensive amusements. Each\nhamlet is largely self-supporting; a little salt and iron and occasionally some cotton cloth being the only articles brought from the bazaars. That the people are not discontented is shown by the absence of emigration; the revenue is high but being largely taken in kind does not press too heavily; the soil is fertile and the crops secure. The people are primitive, ignorant and generally devoid of any desire for change.\n\nSection C.\u2014Forests.\n\nThe following are the chief forests in the State.\n\n| Name of forest | Name of trees |\n|----------------|--------------|\n| 1. Dhamaun     | Kelu, kail, rai, tos. |\n| 2. Seri        | Kelu, chil. |\n| 3. Dophia      | Kelu, kail. |\n| 4. Gharlol     | Chil. |\n| 5. Kamana      | Chil, kelu. |\n| 6. Kamrah      | Kelu. |\n| 7. Reog        | Kelu. |\n\nThere are no figures available as to the area, etc. Besides the above there are extensive tracts of waste containing less valuable trees and small patches of deodar, chil, etc. There is no record of the people's rights in forest land. The greater part of the State waste is open to grazing; the people can take dry and fallen trees and shrubs for firewood from all except certain reserved tracts. For building purposes trees are given by the Rajah on payment of a low rate, e.g., 8 to 12 annas for a rai or tos; Rs. 1-8-0 to Rs. 2 for a kail or chil; and Rs. 4 for a deodar. All trees of the more valuable species such as kelu, kail and chil even though standing on privately owned land belong to the State and cannot be cut without permission of the Rajah. The State further lays claim to all specially large trees of the less valuable kinds such as tun, etc., which are reserved for State buildings. The State takes half the produce of the mango trees in Dehrilaka.\n\nThere is no attempt at regular conservation; the Tahsildars and Kardars of Kothis exercise a general supervision; in Tahsil Karsog there are about 40 r\u00e1khas whose pay varies from 13 annas to three rupees per month, plus food, and in Balh there is a darogha who receives Re. 1-8-0 and food. This staff is untrained and the forests receive no skilled attention.\n\nSection D.\u2014Mineral resources.\n\nThere is a little iron ore of poor quality, and at Chaw\u00e1si, R\u00e1mgarh, Meri and Kolpur in Tahsil Karsog there are old mines not now worked.\nSection E.\u2014Arts and manufactures.\n\nThere are no arts or manufactures worthy of mention.\n\nSection F.\u2014Commerce and Trade.\n\nThere are no large towns in the State, and there is no important trade. The State exports rasaunt (berberry), dried violets, millet, honey, ghi, walnut tree bark, and deodar turpentine; it imports salt, iron, cotton goods, oil, spices, sugar, and brass utensils.\n\nSection G.\u2014Means of communication.\n\nThere are no railways and only two miles of metalled road within the State. From the capital radiate four unmetalled roads, the longest of which runs the whole length of the State to Farenu on the Saraj border. There are small rest-houses at Gheri, Jhungi (in Mandi State) and Chindi on this route. From Chindi a road runs south to Bajji State and Simla; there are small rest-houses at Chiragh and Alsindi on this route. Between Alsindi in Suket and Suni in Bajji State, the Sutlej is spanned by an iron suspension bridge, owned jointly by the two States who share the income and expenses equally. At Farenu the Sutlej is spanned by a frail jhula (rope bridge), the property of Suket State, while connecting Suket with Saraj is a new bridge over the Bisua stream erected by the Public Works Department at the expense of the British Government. From the capital a second road runs to Dehr on the Sutlej which is here crossed by a boat ferry owned jointly by the States of Suket and Kahur (Bilaspur). Each State levies its own tolls on this ferry. At Dehr is a small rest-house. The question of erecting a bridge here is under consideration.\n\nA third road runs from the capital through the Balh to Mandi; the first two miles are metalled and the metalling of the remainder is about to be undertaken.\n\nA fourth road branches off from this one and joins the Mandi-Hoshiarpur road.\n\nAt Suket is a d\u00e1k bungalow above Bhojpur where this last road branches off.\n\nThe roads are maintained in good order and are everywhere practicable for laden animals.\n\nBritish postage stamps are used in the State, which has no postal system of its own. There are only two post offices, viz., a sub-post office at Buned opened in 1878 and a branch office at Bhojpur opened in June 1906.\nSince 1878 the State has paid Rs. 28 per month as a contribution to the Imperial Post Office, and in consideration of this the State correspondence with the Commissioner and Superintendent of Jullundur (Political Agent of the State), the Assistant Commissioner of Kulu (Assistant Political Agent) and the Wazir of Mandi is carried over the Imperial lines free of charge.\n\nA Telegraph Office was opened at Buned in January 1906.\n\nIt is seldom that the State suffers from want of rain, and there is no record of any serious famine. In Sambat 1949 (A.D. 1893-94) however there was considerable distress and the State opened Relief Works for the destitute. For those who were unfit for labour, Rs. 1,500 was expended on the purchase of grain which was distributed by the State officials.\n\nIn 1899 A.D. an epidemic of foot and mouth disease carried off many cattle, and the Rajah advanced Rs. 7,000 as takkavi for the purchase of fresh cattle.\n\nIn the famine of 1893-94 it is said that wheat sold at 8 sers, rice at $6\\frac{1}{2}$, and millet and gram at 10 seers the rupee.\nCHAPTER III.\u2014ADMINISTRATIVE.\n\nSection A.\u2014Administrative Divisions.\n\nThe State of Suket is administered by His Highness the Rajah in person who exercises a complete and thorough control over the various departments. The chief executive and final appellate judicial powers are retained by him and financial matters are entirely in his hands.\n\nThe headquarters staff comprise the following members:\n\n- Wazir ........................................ Seth Panna Lal.\n- Adalati ......................................... Lala Kahn Chand.\n- Tahsildar ...................................... Pandit Jaigopal.\n- Police ........................................... Barkat Ali Shah.\n- Medical and Jail ............................. Wazir Khan.\n\nNone of these appointments are hereditary. There are two Tahsils, Balh and Karsog; the former is under the Sadr Tahsildar, it comprises the Dehr ilaka (or garh), Kothi Sadr and Kothi Sainji.\n\nThe Dehr garh is under a k\u00e1rdar who is assisted by two p\u00e1nchas, one Koti\u00e1la and 6 peons, under each p\u00e1nch are 3 or 4 Mehrs.\n\nThe k\u00e1rdar (kaisth) collects the revenue, keeps the accounts, carries out the orders of the Rajah and supervises the work of his subordinates. He receives Rs. 4 a month and food.\n\nThe p\u00e1nch assists the k\u00e1rdar; they are paid Rs. 3 per month cash, without food. The koti\u00e1la is the weigher of grain received as revenue, of which he keeps the accounts. He receives Rs. 2 per month and free food.\n\nThe mehr is the lambardar, he is the real collector of revenue from the zamindars; and is also responsible for providing beg\u00e1ris.\n\nBesides the above there are jeltas or chaukidars who are paid ten lakhs (6 maunds pakka) rice and one lakh (32 seers pakka) wheat yearly by the k\u00e1rdar out of the State granary.\n\nKothi Sainji has a k\u00e1rdar (or kaisth), one peon who also acts as weigher, and a jelta.\n\nThe rest of the tahsil is comprised in Kothi Sadr, it has a kotwal who is responsible for the recovery of the land revenue, two kaisths who keep the accounts, 14 mehrs and 14 jeltas.\n\nBesides the above, there are 2 kaisths (accountants), a koti\u00e1la, 3 weighers and a ni\u00e1rtan (who cleans the grain and granary) attached to the sadr granaries.\n\nThe garh of Dehr is partially independent of the tahsil and its accounts are kept separate. It at one time possessed a Naib Tahsildar.\nTahsil Karsog is under a Tahsildar who, however, has no judicial powers; he is merely the collector of revenue. The tahsil is subdivided into 16 ghars or kilas; each has a p\u00e1sra and a kaisth, and under these are 3 or 4 Mehrs, a peon and 2 jeltas for each garh.\n\nThe p\u00e1sra is generally responsible for all public work within the garh; the kaisth is the writer and keeper of the accounts. The p\u00e1sra receives Rs. 1-8-0 to Rs. 3 per month, and in some cases free food; the kaisth is paid Rs. 3 or Rs. 4 per month, and usually, free food.\n\nThe Tahsildar of Balh is invested with third class civil and second class criminal powers, and in revenue matters he is an Assistant Collector, 2nd grade.\n\nThe Adalati exercises second class civil and criminal powers and hears appeals from the orders of the Tahsildars.\n\nThe Wazir exercises the powers of a Collector in revenue cases, of a first class Magistrate in criminal cases, and of a District Judge in civil cases. He also hears appeals from the subordinate courts.\n\nThe Ijlasi-khas or Chief Court of His Highness the Rajah is the final court in all branches. He exercises full civil and revenue powers, and the powers of a Sessions Judge in criminal cases.\n\nSection B.\u2014Civil and Criminal Justice.\n\nThere is very little litigation; about 1,000 Criminal, 500 civil and 400 Revenue Court cases are instituted in a year.\n\nThere are no legal practitioners or licensed petition-writers.\n\nFor the extradition of criminals, agreements exist with the adjoining States of Mandi, Bilaspur and Bajji. Extradition from other States is effected through the Commissioner and Superintendent of Jullundur who is the Political Agent.\n\nThe Indian Penal Code, Criminal and Civil Procedure Codes, the Contract and Evidence Acts are in force.\n\nThe Court fees as at present fixed are as follows:\n\n- Original, Civil ... ... ... ... 10 per cent. of the value.\n- Original, Revenue ... ... ... ... Re. 1-2-0.\n- Do., Criminal ... ... ... ... 3 annas.\n- All classes of appeals and miscellaneous ... 3 annas.\n\nThere are no stamps used on receipts, bonds and deeds.\n\nWith the exception of a limit of fifteen years on suits for money lent, there are no rules of limitation for original or appellate cases.\n\nThere are no special laws and no system of registration.\n\nThe State takes 25 per cent. of the amount of any sale price or damages paid on account of women, if the case comes into Court.\nSection C.\u2014Land Revenue.\n\nThere are no village communities in the sense as understood in the plains; the people live in widely scattered houses or tiny hamlets, a whole collection of which, lacking in unity and common interests, constitutes a garh or kila.\n\nThere is no shamiat, no trace of communal ownership, each landlord owns just so much as he holds. The Rajah is absolute owner of the waste and superior proprietor of the cultivated land; the agriculturists own the land for their own cultivation for their own lifetime; they cannot sell or mortgage without the permission of the Rajah, and on the death of an owner, mutation in the names of his heirs requires the Rajah's sanction. If the heirs be sons or very near relatives, mutation is sanctioned as a matter of course though not as a matter of right; if the claimant be fractious or have given offence, the land is transferred to some one else.\n\nIf the heirs be collaterals or distant relatives, a nazrana is taken before mutation is sanctioned; if there be several distant heirs disputing over priority of claim, the land is given to the one who offers the highest nazrana. The people's rights approach nearer to those of occupancy tenants than of proprietors. There is no record of rights but there is a record of dues, called a zaminband, in which is recorded each man's name with the amount of revenue due from him and the amount of land on account of which this revenue is due. There has been no regular settlement and there is no regular system of assessment. There is no collective responsibility for the revenue, the revenue assessed is not fixed for any specified period; it may be, and often is, altered when mutation in favour of a deceased owner's heirs is sanctioned.\n\nThe zaminband is the sole revenue record, it contains the names of all owners arranged by garhs, the amount of land estimated in lakhs and khars, and the amount of revenue due. There is a separate zaminband for Tahsils Balh and Karsog and the Dehr ilaka; copies of the relevant entries are kept by each kardar or palsra who informs the mehr of the amount of revenue to be collected from the hamlets in his circle.\n\nThere are no occupancy tenants.\n\nLand left without heirs becomes escheat to the Rajah who has it remeasured and reassessed and leases it to someone on payment of a nazrana.\n\nThe zaminband shows 4,339 revenue payers in Karsog, 2,323 in Balh and 871 in Dehr.\n\nThe assessment averages Rs. 13 per khar, it actually varies from Rs. 5 to Rs. 38 per khar; this is the consolidated cash\nrevenue which is collected from, roughly, two-thirds of the cultivated area. The revenue collected in kind is\u2014\n\n20 lakhs rice\n2 Do. wheat\n1 lakh bais (grain)\nRe. 1 d\u00e1l tar\n4 annas b\u00e1chch\n\nPer khar.\n\nand further:\n\n10 pattas (one bundle) of grain per plough.\n\nThe grain revenue is collected by the k\u00e1rdar or p\u00e1lsra and is by them forwarded to the tahsil or to s\u00e1dr as required. There is a large granary (kothi h\u00e1zra) at Buned. This grain is utilized for the feeding of begaris and for paying minor officials in kind.\n\nAccepting the rough estimates previously given for the outturn and price of the principal crops, the following rough estimate may be given of the value of the four crops per khar:\n\n| Crop | Ropa | Bohokhal |\n|------|------|----------|\n| Maize | Balh | Rs. 46 | Rs. 22 |\n|      | Karsog |      | Rs. 90 |\n| Wheat | Balh | Rs. 80 | Rs. 32 |\n|      | Karsog |      | Rs. 100 |\n| Rice | Balh | Rs. 80 | Rs. 40 |\n|      | Karsog |      |        |\n| Kodra | Balh |      | Rs. 35 |\n|      | Karsog |      | Rs. 77 |\n\nSo far as these figures go, they seem to show that the revenue assessed is a little less than one-third of the value of the gross produce, and this is the proportion intended.\n\nThe total land revenue for 1904 was Rs. 74,495 which does not seem excessive from a population of 54,676; very few of whom are tenants or labourers, inhabiting a fertile tract with generally a sufficient and evenly distributed rainfall.\n\nThe zaminband shows the area cultivated in Karsog to be 3,100 rupees, in Balh to be 2,081 khars and in Dehr to be 374 khars. Assuming the rupee to be equivalent to the khar, the total cultivated area is 5,555 khars (44,440 acres) distributed amongst 7,633 revenue payers, paying Rs. 74,495 land revenue annually.\nSection D.\u2014Miscellaneous Revenue.\n\nThe miscellaneous revenue is about Rs. 36,000. The following is a brief summary of the various sources:\n\n*K\u00e1r chompri* is a tax on milch cattle in return for grazing; in Karsog each house pays one ser kachcha of ghi annually; in Balh four or five sers pakka of ghi is paid for every buffalo that calves. The annual income from this source is about Rs. 2,400.\n\nOn sheep and goats a grazing fee (*ginakerti*) is collected at the rate of Rs. 2 to Rs. 4 per hundred; the annual income is Rs. 2,900.\n\n*Muda loha* is a tax on the use of imported iron at the rate of Re. 1 per furnace per year; the annual receipts are about Rs. 200.\n\n*Bata\u00f1ona* is the compensation paid in order to escape rendering begar; it is levied at the rate of one to three rupees annually per khar of land owned and yields about Rs. 612.\n\n*Theka gr\u00e1t* is a tax of 8 annas to Rs. 3 on the water-mills for grinding flour; it yields Rs. 310.\n\n*Palela* is a tax of two to four sers of oil on each oil press; it yields Rs. 55.\n\n*Zag\u00e1tkhana* includes income from opium, octroi and a grazing fee of two annas on each pony, camel or mule accompanying travellers or traders into the State, it also includes the income from the Nalw\u00e1ra fair. The total income is Rs. 5,400.\n\n*Jins\u00e1l* is the contract for skins mentioned in Chapter II. It brings in Rs. 2,350.\n\n*Chaka kain* is the income from the lease of State quarries; it yields Rs. 450.\n\n*Charas.* The contract for the sale of charas yields Rs. 662.\n\n*Manihari* is the tax on shops for retail sale of miscellaneous goods; it yields Rs. 300.\n\n*Bangchuhru* is the tax on shops for sale of bracelets, etc.; it yields Rs. 40.\n\nSimilarly the shops selling tobacco pay from two annas to Re. 1 each, and yield Rs. 156. The halwai shops yield Rs. 70.\n\nThe abkari income derived from the contract for sale of spirits amounts to Rs. 2,275. Even the drummers are taxed Rs. 5 to Rs. 7 per year and collectively contribute Rs. 43 to the State income.\n\nBelnas (sugarcane presses) pay a fee of Rs. 2 if they are made from wood obtained free from the State forests.\n\nBridegrooms from outside districts coming to Suket for brides have to pay Rs. 2 each (*panglot*), but the income from this source is small (Rs. 6 in 1894).\n\nOther sources of miscellaneous revenue are ferry tolls (Rs. 1,100), Court fees and fines (Rs. 8,800), forests (Rs. 10,000) and irrigation fees, sag\u00e1hi (Rs. 64).\nSection E.\u2014Local and Municipal Government.\n\nThere is no Local and Municipal Government.\n\nSection F.\u2014Public Works.\n\nThere is no permanent Public Works staff; all State works are carried out by beguris who receive free food. The annual expenditure is above Rs. 3,000. There are the usual public buildings at Baned, the Rajah's palaces, a guest house, dispensary and post office, jail, tahsil, etc., but none are in any way notable. Nearly all have been erected in the reign of the present Rajah.\n\nSection G.\u2014Army.\n\nThe State maintains one daffadar and 10 sowars paid and mounted at State expense, and there are 15 more sowars who provide their own mounts and receive revenue free land. Besides the above there are one jemadar and 60 sepoys, including police.\n\nSection H.\u2014Police and Jails.\n\nThere are at present two Deputy Inspectors of Police, both at the sadr thana; it is intended to establish shortly a new thana at Karsog.\n\nCrime is trifling, a few cases of burglary and theft occur, but they are not serious: offences relating to women are somewhat common.\n\nThere is a jail with accommodation for 50 prisoners; the average daily number of inmates is at present about 20. The annual expenditure is Rs. 1,064. There are no jail industries.\n\nSection I.\u2014Education.\n\nThere is one Urdu Primary School at Bhojpur, opened in 1898; and maintained at an annual cost of Rs. 453. New schools at Dehr and Karsog have been sanctioned, but have not yet been opened.\n\nThere is a private Sh\u00e1stri school at Naggar, and Hindi is taught by private persons in the villages, but the standard of education is very low and outside the bazaars few literate people are to be met with.\n\nSection J.\u2014Medical.\n\nThere is a dispensary at Buned, maintained at an annual cost Rs. 2,868; it is in charge of a failed Hospital Assistant. Government vaccinators regularly visit the State and the people freely submit to the operation.\nCHAPTER IV.\u2014PLACES OF INTEREST.\n\nAt P\u00e1ngna in Tahsil Karsog is a fine well preserved fort, originally erected by Rajah Bir Sain who established his capital here; it is now used as the headquarters of the P\u00e1ngna garh.\n\nThere are various smaller forts in picturesque situations which serve as the headquarters of the garhs; that at Deh deserves separate mention.\n\nThere are temples in the usual style at the capital, and near Karsog is the temple of Mahun\u00e1g which is visited by pilgrims and especially by persons who have been bitten by snakes. The cure consists simply in lying down inside.\n\"A book that is shut is but a block\"\n\nCENTRAL ARCHAEOLOGICAL LIBRARY\n\nGOVT.
