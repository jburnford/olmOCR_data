One was convicted of an unnatural offence, the second was convicted of several burglaries, and sentenced to four years' penal servitude, and the third pleaded \"Guilty\" to an assault. The latter prisoner was subject to epileptic fits, and was going out one morning to put up the barns for his marriage with a young woman similarly afflicted. The mother said she had something in her pocket which would keep him at home, upon which the prisoner took up a brush and threw it at his mother, and struck her on her forehead and made it bleed. The father, in a passion, sent for the police, and the prisoner was sent to prison, where he had remained since the month of March last. Having pleaded \"Guilty,\" Mr. Baron Alderson ordered him to be discharged, on his entering into his own recognisances to be of good behaviour for three years.\n\nTHE QUEEN v. BENSON (CLERK).\u2014A CLERGYMAN REMARRYING.\u2014This was an indictment which charged the Rev. Richard Meux Benson, perpetual curate of Cowley, near Oxford, with a felony, in marrying two persons who were already man and wife, without licence. The indictment had been found at the last assizes, but had been removed certiorari, and now came down to be tried on the civil side of the court. The indictment had been preferred at the instance of the government, in consequence of the practice which a portion of the clergy have recently adopted, of recommending their parishioners who had been married under the Dissenters Marriage act to be remarried according to the rites of the church of England. In reviewing the case, the judge said Mr. Benson was liable to the reprehension of his bishop, if the bishop thought he had done an unwarrantable act; but the question was one for the family jurisdiction of the bishop, and not a case to be brought into a court of justice. His lordship therefore advised the jury to find the prisoner not guilty; in point of law it was no offence.\u2014The jury complied, and the prisoner was discharged.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3206313644.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 1246, "total-output-tokens": 480, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 2076, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
