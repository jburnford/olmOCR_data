The deceased was a lad 12 years old, and it appeared that on the 25th of October he and some other boys were playing in Salamanca-row, Lambeth, when the prisoner, accompanied by a woman, went into a dust-yard close by. The deceased and some of the other boys followed them, and the prisoner being annoyed at their conduct, took up a brickbat and threw it at the deceased, and hit him on the back of the head, thereby inflicting wounds which resulted in tetanus, or lock-jaw, and death ensued.\u2014The jury found the prisoner \"Guilty.\" Sentence was postponed.\n\nKILLED IN THE STREET.\u2014William Farnam surrendered to take his trial for the manslaughter of John Baker.\u2014The transaction in question occurred on the night of the 8th of November, about 12 o'clock.\u2014The prisoner was driving a pony in a cart on which there was another man and a woman, and it was alleged that the prisoner was driving at a very fast pace. The deceased, who was a working man, was standing in the road, and he was knocked down, and received an injury in the temple, which caused his death.\u2014The defence was that the unfortunate affair was the result of accident.\u2014The jury returned a verdict of \"Not guilty.\"\n\nRECEIVING STOLEN GOODS.\u2014Thomas Bretton, 49, and Susan Bretton, his wife, were indicted for receiving a large quantity of property, knowing it to have been stolen.\u2014The male prisoner was a cabman, having stables in Montague-mews, Russell-square, and the police from information they received searching his place, a great quantity of property, the produce of various robberies, was discovered.\u2014The jury \"Acquitted\" the woman, and found the man \"Guilty.\" He was sentenced to five years' penal servitude.\n\nALLEGED OUTRAGE.\u2014Five young men named George Allen, aged 17, William Knight, aged 17, William Jenkins, aged 20, John Goldsmith, aged 17, and Charles Allen, aged 19, were put upon their trial for a felonious assault upon Sarah Warwick, 18 years of age.\u2014The prosecutrix, Sarah Warwick, a modest, respectable-looking girl, said her parents resided at Holloway, and she was engaged as a servant with a Mr. Rowley, who kept a grocer's shop at Kentish-town. She left that service on the 16th of October, and went to her mother's house, and on Sunday, the 19th of October, she went out for a walk in the afternoon and met the prisoner Knight, whom she had known a short time before, and he asked her to take a short walk with him, and she consented. They walked together for some time, and she said she must go home, and the prisoner told her he would pay her ordinary fare. They were at this time in the Anson-road, Tufnell-park\u2014a lonely place\u2014and when they came near some unfinished houses Knight shoved her into one of them, and all the other prisoners came in. The witness then described what occurred, and said that she was forced down, and every one of the prisoners insulted her. She tried to call out, and one of the prisoners told her that if she made a noise he would beat her with a brickbat. The prisoners all then went away, leaving her in a most exhausted condition. She positively swore to the identity of the whole of the prisoners as being the persons who insulted her.\u2014The prisoners acknowledged that what they had done was with the consent of the prosecutrix.\u2014A witness stated that the only means of access to the house was across a plank.\u2014The jury, after 20 minutes' deliberation, found the prisoners \"Not guilty.\"\n\nTHE CHARGE AGAINST MR. FROGGATT.\u2014Upon the application of Mr. Warner Sleigh, who is instructed for the defence of the trial of Mr. Edward Froggatt, the solicitor, who was convicted of being concerned in the De Goncourt turf frauds, and who is charged as a fraudulent trustee with misappropriating a large sum of money, the case was postponed to the next session on the ground that prisoner had not had time to prepare his defence.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3206245847.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 878, "total-output-tokens": 962, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 3990, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
