P. Gazetteer and was compiled for the most part from the settlement reports of Major Ternan and Mr. P. White. The history, except for the Mutiny period, was not dealt with separately, but was treated generally with the history of the Bundelkhand tract. The present volume is entirely new in form, and much of the matter is new. The district is not one of great interest from any point of view, and has never been so systematically investigated as most others have. Consequently the information on many points is very meagre, though it has been found possible to collect a large number of facts of interest from various sources. My personal knowledge of the district is small, and I am entirely indebted for the matter to the settlement reports of Messrs. White and Hailey, and to the notes left by Mr. F. J. Cooke. I also desire to acknowledge the kindness of Mr. R. H. L. Clarke in furnishing many notes connected with the present administration. The history I have myself compiled from various sources.\n\nAllahabad.\n\nJanuary, 1909.\n\nD. L.

It has a total area of 991,357 acres or 1,549 square miles, within which are included 78.43 square miles belonging to the jagirdars of Rampura, Jagamanpur and Gopalpura, lying in the north-western corner. It is situated between the parallels of 26\u00b0 27' and 25\u00b0 46' north latitude and 79\u00b0 52' and 78\u00b0 56' east longitude, and forms a compact block of territory of regular shape. On the west the boundary is formed by the Pahuj river, except at one point where the Datia State intrudes like a wedge into Kunch tahsil and again to the north of this, where the district projects here and there beyond the stream. On the north flows the Jumna, the boundary between the district and Etawah and Cawnpore. On the south-west Jalaun adjoins the Samthar State, except where that state encircles an outlying village belonging to Jhansi, and to the south-east the Betwa divides it first from Jhansi and then from Hamirpur. Towards the east the district narrows as the Betwa converges on the Jumna, but in this direction the Baoni State interposes an irregularly bounded tract of country between it and that part of Hamirpur which lies between the two rivers; only on the Samthar and Baoni border is the district not bounded by ravines.\n\nThe arterial drainage of Bundelkhand usually consists of a watershed somewhere between two rivers whence the drainage flows into them on either side. The surface formation of the Jalaun district is entirely different. The highlands border on the khadar valleys of the Betwa and Pahuj, while the low lands occupy the central tract. The latter is thus a wide flat basin encircled by a narrow rim of higher ground which breaks up into a network of ravines along the river banks, stretching for some miles inland from the streams. The levels are clearly indicated from the situation and direction of the two branches of the Betwa canal which follow the watersheds closely. The drainage of the central tract is supplied by two minor streams, the Non and the Melunga, which\nflowing north-eastwards unite some eight miles from the Jumna bank and join that river an equal distance to the north of the town of Kalpi. Like the larger rivers they have carved deep ravines which increase in extent the nearer the Jumna is approached, and, as a consequence of their action, the Kalpi pargana is cut up by a tracery of ravines which have scoured the greater portion of the soil.\n\nThe natural divisions into which the country falls are few and clearly marked. Along the outer edge is the ravine belt, fringed here and there, where the contour of the land permits, by strips of rich alluvial soil, but for the most part consisting of low hummocks thickly strewn with kankar and clad with the thinnest scrub or vegetation. The upland which succeeds is composed of light-coloured hard soil, the most valuable properties of which are being continually washed away by the downward flow of rainwater. Except in the north, the gradual fall in the surface to the level plain of the centre can be clearly traced by the deepening in the colour of the soil. The light soil gives place to a dark kabar which in turn is replaced by mar or black cotton soil. These two dark soils occupy practically the whole of the south and centre of the district beyond the upland, excluding the area in pargana Kalpi affected by the Non and the Melunga; they cover the greater part of Kunch and Orai, the southern half of Jalaun, and the western portion of Kalpi. Of the total area they engross approximately 69 per cent., while the pure parwa of the northern tract covers 11 per cent, and the rakar upland and alluvial soils occupy 20 per cent.\n\nWith the exception of two rocky outcrops near Saiyidnagar in tahsil Orai, the district contains no hills, and is covered entirely by Gangetic alluvium. In the central tract an uninterrupted expanse of vegetation-covered but sparsely wooded soil stretches before the eye. The villages composed of brick houses with red tiled roofs lie far apart and stand elevated above the plain on hillocks apparently of artificial construction, often with the frowning ruins of a fort close by. Beyond the mar and kabar plain going northwards lies a neutral tract in which the latter soil is mixed with parwa, the darker element gradually disappearing. Beyond this again lies a region of an almost white loamy earth like the soil of the doab. Here the villages lie thicker, cultivation is much closer and mahua\nor mango groves in goodly numbers vary the landscape. Surrounding this central tract on every side except the extreme south-west lies the ravine girdle with its barren undulations or scrub jungle, presenting from the upland the most complete picture of desolation.\n\nThe soils are the well-known soils of Bundelkhand, mar, kabar, parwa and rakar. Mar is a calcareous soil of a prevailing blackish hue interspersed with small lumps of kankar, friable and very retentive of moisture. It possesses a high degree of fertility, growing year after year crops of mixed wheat and gram with neither irrigation nor manure. It is, however, exposed to peculiar dangers. It becomes quickly oversaturated with moisture and, when this happens, its miry nature renders tillage impossible. Kans too runs riot in it, throwing large areas out of cultivation, and rust spreads with extraordinary rapidity in wet springs. Kabar is the most widely diffused of any soil. It consists of two kinds, the pure dark kabar which has much in common with mar, and the lighter coloured variety probably containing an admixture of parwa. Both kinds are distinguished by extreme hardness and cohesion. The dark kabar possesses in a lesser degree the retentiveness of moisture which characterizes the mar, but the lighter coloured soil dries quickly as soon as the rains are at an end. If the rains are heavy the land becomes a quagmire; when they cease, it hardens rapidly and cakes to such an extent that it cannot be turned over by the plough. Parwa in its pure form is almost confined to the northern portion of the district and the alluvial areas. Elsewhere, on the uplands, in the dark soil and in the neutral tracts, it is found in an impure form mixed with kabar and hardly distinguishable from the lighter coloured variety of that soil. Pure parwa is a loam of mixed clay and sand, usually with a grey colour but often assuming a reddish tinge. It is a fertile soil and with the aid of manure and irrigation will grow most varieties of crops. Porous in texture, it is capable of absorbing any amount of rain and even if the rainfall ceases early it can still be prepared for rabi. Rakar is a refuse soil lying on sloping ground or in ravines. It is usually thickly strewn with kankar and in its poorer forms is too weak for continuous cultivation. It is commonly divided into moti and patli, the former connoting deterioratior\nvarieties of mar and heavier katar and the latter of lighter kabar and parwa. Kachhar and tari or tir are alluvial soils in the beds of streams and rivers, whose quality depends entirely on the normal floods. They vary greatly and are liable to serious injury if not annihilation by the deposit of shingle or stones or the erosive action of the water.\n\nThe only conventional soil recognised is gauhan. This is not, however, a variety of soil, but is merely the area which has gained an enhanced value from its position near the village site. At the recent settlement gauhan occupied only 1\u00b711 per cent. of the total cultivated area. Of the remainder 30\u00b754 per cent. was classified as mar, 29\u00b774 per cent. as kabar, 27\u00b747 per cent. as parwa and 8\u00b798 per cent as rakar of both varieties. These proportions do not, however, truly represent the extent to which these soils prevail in the whole area of the district; large areas of the black soils always remain uncultivated and the extent of rakar in every tahsil is very great along the banks of streams or in other tracts where deterioration has set in; the figures only serve to show the part played by the various soils in the agriculture of the district. Tir and kachhar occupied 2\u00b716 per cent of the cultivated area, but as these soils are seldom left unploughed, that figure may be accepted as an approximately correct estimate of their proportions in the district.\n\nThe composition of these soils has been recently investigated on the experimental farm at Orai, and as the matter is of considerable interest, the results may here be tabulated:\n\n| Soil constituents | Mar | Kabar | Parwa | Rakar |\n|-------------------|-----|-------|-------|-------|\n| Insoluble silicates and sand | 74\u00b774 | 73\u00b776 | 75\u00b793 | 76\u00b749 |\n| Ferric oxide | 5\u00b769 | 6\u00b773 | 5\u00b755 | 6\u00b770 |\n| Alumina | 9\u00b723 | 8\u00b757 | 9\u00b745 | 9\u00b768 |\n| Lime | 2\u00b738 | 2\u00b749 | 1\u00b778 | 1\u00b742 |\n| Magnesia | 1\u00b740 | 2\u00b705 | 1\u00b727 | 8\u00b75 |\n| Potash | 8\u00b71 | 7\u00b74 | 6\u00b78 | 9\u00b70 |\n| Soda | 6\u00b75 | 1\u00b75 | 2\u00b73 | 0\u00b74 |\n| Phosphoric acid | 0\u00b79 | 0\u00b78 | 0\u00b77 | 0\u00b77 |\n| Sulphuric acid | 0\u00b707 | 0\u00b708 | 0\u00b703 | 0\u00b703 |\n| Carbonic acid | 3\u00b70 | 3\u00b75 | 2\u00b728 | 2\u00b722 |\n| Organic matter and combined water | 4\u00b790 | 5\u00b782 | 4\u00b750 | 6\u00b741 |\n\nTotal | 100\u00b700 | 100\u00b700 | 100\u00b700 | 100\u00b700 |\nGeneral Features.\n\n| Soil constituents | Mar. | Kabar. | Povra. | Rakar. |\n|-------------------|------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Nitrogen per cent. | '01  | '04    | '039   | '031   |\n| Available phosphoric acid per cent. | '010 | '008   | '0088  | '0049  |\n| Available potash per cent. | '015 | '018   | '031   | '009   |\n| Equivalent to calcium carbonate | ...  | ...    | '03    | '49    |\n\nThe division of black soil into mar and kabar is not recognised in the Central Provinces and those portions of native Bundelkhand which border on them, where both are known as regar or moto. Their origin is generally ascribed to the subaqueous decomposition of trap rocks, but the theory has also been advanced that it may really be due to suba\u00ebrial denudation of basaltic rocks and the impregnation of certain argillaceous soils by organic matter, the latter ingredient together with iron giving it its black colour. Besides its adhesiveness and capacity for retaining moisture, black soil expands and contracts in an unusual degree under the influence of moisture and dryness, opening out into large fissures at frequent intervals and constituting a well-known danger to the horseman. The mechanical analysis of all four soils is given in the subjoined table:\n\n| Diameter | Mar. | Kabar. | Povra. | Rakar. |\n|----------|------|--------|--------|--------|\n| M.M.     |      |        |        |        |\n| '16      |      |        |        |        |\n| '25      |      |        |        |        |\n| '16\u2014'032 |      |        |        |        |\n| '25\u2014'032 |      |        |        |        |\n| '16\u2014'032 |      |        |        |        |\n| '016\u2014'008 |      |        |        |        |\n| '008\u2014'004 |      |        |        |        |\n| '004\u2014'003 |      |        |        |        |\n| '002     |      |        |        |        |\n\nThe rivers of the district consist of the Jumna, the Betwa, the Pahuj and several minor streams, among which the Non and the Melunga have already been noted. The latter are for the most part deep-bedded torrents which merely serve to carry off the drainage of the central black-soil plain during the rains and then dry up completely. In the upper portions of their courses they have low and shelving sides, but as they approach the main rivers...\nthey cut more abruptly and have scored out their banks to a considerable extent. Near the junction with the Jumna they have been responsible for more extensive erosion and deterioration. The Non rises in tahsil Orai and drains the southern portion of the district; the Melunga starting not far from the town of Kunch flows due north as far as Hadrukh and turning near that town abruptly east, holds a course parallel to the Jumna till it unites with the Non at Mahewa in pargana Kalpi.\n\nThe Jumna first touches the district at the village of Sitoura in the Jagamanpur jagir, at the point where it is joined by the Sindh river. It flows with a gently curving course, forming the boundary with the Etawah district, as far as Shergarh ghat on the road from Jalaun to Auraiya, and then turns south, continuing to form the district limit till it leaves it some ten miles south-east of Kalpi town on the border of Baoni State. With the exception of a sudden loop north of the old city of Raipur, its course is not characterized by any abrupt curves or bends. Its total length within district limits is approximately 52 miles, and the Jalaun bank is for the most part steep with little space for the deposit of alluvial soil between the river and the cliff, but is scored by innumerable ravines which reach their greatest development near the exit of the Non. The breadth of the stream which is confined within lofty banks for most of its course along this district, varies from 600 feet in May to 1,600 feet in the rains, and has a depth in the centre of its channel of some 20 feet, though this is much varied by the existence of sand banks that are continually shifting. It is this latter circumstance that impairs its utility as a highway, and though it is navigable by boats of small draught and displacement, the diversion of its waters into canals has rendered navigation on it more uncertain than ever. The only permanent bridge over it is that at Kalpi on the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, at which point the metalled road also is provided in the cold and hot weather with a pontoon bridge; elsewhere the passage has to be made by fords or ferries.\n\nThe Betwa forms the boundary with Jhansi along the southern border from a point a few miles east of the town of Erichh to its junction with the Dhasan. Its course, which up to the junction runs due east, tends thence somewhat to the north-east and it meanders along the south-eastern sides of tahsils Orai and Kalpi.\nseparating them from Hamirpur. Like the Jumna, it leaves the district on the Baoni boundary, but unlike that river it flows in a tortuous channel with many loops and bends. Its bed is no longer strewn with rocks and boulders as in parts of Jhansi and Lalitpur, but it flows with a rapid current in the rains and subsides to a narrow stream in the hot weather; this makes it useless for navigation. Its total length along the district border is approximately 60 miles, but from point to point it does not exceed 42 miles. It is nowhere bridged and is for the most part fordable, but on important lines of communication, and at other points during the rains, ferries are provided. Both banks are fringed for some distance inland by unculturable ravines.\n\nThe Pahuj, which rises in Gwalior State and flows through Jhansi, reaches Jalaun in the south-western corner of pargana Kunch at the village of Salaiya Enzurg. It is a much smaller river than the Betwa, flows in a deep channel between high banks in a sinuous course along the western side of that tahsil, cuts across the intruding Datia territory at Nadiagaon and thence pursues its way northwards along the borders of pargana Madhogarh. At Ruri, Urichli and Makui, the two latter villages belonging to the Gopalpur jagir, it cuts off three projecting pieces of British territory, and in this direction it becomes more tortuous than ever. Within six miles north-west of Madhogarh town it flows through the Rampura jagir, and at the village of Jaghar joins the Sindh. The bed of the stream is rocky or sandy and in the rains it is subject to sudden rushes of water which make it impassable. On both sides its banks are scored for a long distance inland with ravines and nadas, nor can it be used either for irrigation or navigation.\n\nAs in other parts of Bundelkhand the soil suffers rather from excessive than deficient drainage. In this connection a natural characteristic of pargana Kunch needs to be noticed. That tract of country is said to have been watered by a considerable annual rain-flood called the pou. Entering by three channels, at Kishanpura and Sunau from the Samthar highlands and at Khukul on the west from the Datia State, it spread over 30 villages in all, in 18 of which it passed over the entire area. Most of the flood water was brought down by way of Khukul and Sunau.\nlittle by that of Kishanpura, in which direction it more quickly drained off. Inundation did not commence till these channels had traversed half the length of the pargana, and the approximate area covered by the flood was 22,400 acres. It generally occurred twice or thrice during the rainy season, lasting variously from three days to a week each time. The bulk of the soil submerged was mar or heavy kabar which was not only saturated but enriched by a fertilising deposit of silt. In this tract, however, the pow was not an unmixed good, for if it happened to be brought down in sudden freshes towards the conclusion of the rains, that retentive soil was unable to get rid of its excessive moisture in time for the rabi sowing. To kabar and mixed soil it was immensely beneficial. Though it was noticed in 1842 by Mr. (afterwards Sir William) Muir, and described by Mr. White, the Settlement Officer in 1874, neither the villagers nor subordinate officials appear now to be aware of its existence or even of the use of the word in this connection. It is possible that road and railway construction, the digging of canals and drainage cuts, and the extension of the Melunga and its tentacles have diverted the flood. There are no natural lakes or jhils in the district.\n\nThe area returned as barren waste in 1907 was 195,667 acres or 20.78 per cent. of the whole district. This, however, included the area under water, amounting to 29,791 acres, and also the land occupied by sites, roads and the like. The remainder consists for the most part of barren ravines along the river banks; this covered 117,845 acres, nearly half of which was in tahsil Kalpi, and almost the whole of the remainder in tahsils Jalaun and Orai. Pargana Kunch contains less than one per cent. of barren waste. These figures suggest, however, that the actual area of land for all practical purposes unfit for cultivation is under-stated, for even Kunch contains much wild country fringing the Pahuj. In the same tahsil the area returned as occupied by buildings, roads, etc., amounts to 13\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) per cent. of the total area. If the bulk of this area be transferred to the head of waste, the proportion of barren land unfit for cultivation in Kunch approaches closely that found in Jalaun and Orai, and the proportion in the whole district rises to some 130,000 acres or nearly 20 per cent.\nGeneral Features.\n\nThe other waste lands that are not sterile or in which cultivation is not precluded amount to 22,327 acres or 2-3 per cent. of the total area. In this is included partly areas overgrown with *kans* and partly tracts covered with grass or scattered trees. For some years the Government maintained two *runds* or grass and wood preserves, one at Timron in tahsil Orai and the other covering parts of four villages, namely Chiraoli, Jumrohi, Gumuli and Mowai Ait in tahsil Kunch. The first had an area of 958 acres and the second, under the collective name of Dang Pathariya dating from Maratha times, of 1,075 acres. The former lay on good level *mar* and *habar* soil and produced a rich crop of *musel* and allied grasses, while the latter extended over ravine and broken ground growing poor fodder, but covered with stunted jungle of *babul*, *dhal*, *karaunda* and other trees. Neither of these *runds* is now preserved, the area covered by them having been restored to the proprietors in 1872.\n\nThe area covered by groves in 1906 was 8,348 acres or less than one per cent. of the whole district. Fenced groves of the Doab type are practically unknown, and the only tree which grows in luxuriance is the *babul*. Conditions however vary. While in the black soil tracts the only relief afforded to the eye is by scattered *nims* and *mahua*, the northern *parwa* tract is much more thickly wooded. Here plantations of both mangoes and *mahua* are found, and the area of groveland in tahsil Jalaun rises to nearly two per cent. The worst wooded tahsil is Kalpi where only 685 acres are recorded; and along the ravine tracts of that portion of the district, the look of desolation is most marked. The district as a whole suffers greatly from lack of fuel; for the *mahua*, the commonest tree, is too valuable for its fruit and flowers to be used as firewood. The *babul* is extensively employed for the manufacture of agricultural implements and carts, but, besides the *mahua*, the only other tree that is seen in any quantity is the *nim*. With the exception of the neighbourhood of Orai and a few other places, roadside avenues are conspicuous by their absence.\n\nThe whole district is precarious, owing to its extreme sensitiveness to droughts. Apart from this, like other portions of Bundelkhand, it is liable to incursions of *kans* which frequently throws large areas out of cultivation. A stout deep-rooted grass,\nkans appears to have a special affinity for the soils of Bundelkhand, and to be inherent in them, while seasons of heavy rainfall by preventing agricultural operations are responsible for its development from a pest into a curse. Under favourable conditions, such as those afforded by a succession of bad seasons, it spreads with extraordinary rapidity, its downy blossoms being carried miles by the wind and establishing it in fields hitherto exempt from its baneful action, and defies the efforts of the cultivator to eradicate it. No remedy has yet been discovered, but it is generally recognised that strong communities can make head against it, while those impoverished by calamities or overassessment are practically at its mercy. Kans is said to run a course of from twelve to fifteen years and then die down, but the period is frequently prolonged to 20 or 25 years. The only palliative known for it is to embank the land in which it grows and let it rot, but this presupposes some capital and enterprise, which are usually lacking to the cultivator. It has also been alleged that kans follows kharif crops more readily than rabi crops; but the reason for this appears to be that where the soil is often ploughed, reploughed, and aerated in preparation for the spring harvest, hans has no opportunity of establishing itself, whereas in the fields hastily prepared for the kharif, it has every advantage for taking root quickly and permanently. At the settlement of 1906 23,616 acres were recorded as kans-infested, but the amount especially in Orai appears to have been under-estimated.\n\nSince 1905 experiments in babul afforestation have been undertaken in the district. The selected sites lie about one mile to the south of Kalpi Railway station, and at the village of Piprayan some 4\u00bd miles south-east of Ata in the same tahsil. The Kalpi plantation occupies approximately 837 acres of ravine land on the banks of the Jumna river. It has a twofold object\u2014firstly, to ascertain whether it is possible to maintain by artificial means and at reasonable cost a supply of babul bark for the Cawnpore tanneries; and secondly, to discover if by any means and at what cost the ever-extending ravines along the large rivers of the province can be successfully arrested or restricted by clothing them with tree-growths. The land for the purpose was acquired in 1904 at a cost of Rs. 1,637, and in the rains of the same year the ground was ploughed and sown with babul seed. At the same time three\nsmall earthen embankments were thrown across one of the nala and on them babul seed was also thickly sown. One of the embankments was washed away, but the seed throughout germinated well, only to be killed off by the frosts of the following cold weather. The area was again ploughed and sown in 1905 and four more embankments were constructed. In the following year the gaps found in the plantations where the seed had failed to germinate were resown and 295 small embankments were made. Seventy-seven were added to this number in 1907, accompanied by further resowing, but germination was again injured by insufficient rain and seedlings were decimated by the violence of the hot weather in 1908. In the year 1908, 180 more embankments were constructed and the refencing of the entire area was as far as possible carried out. All the blanks and failures are again being ploughed and replanted. With one exception all the embankments have proved successful and resulted in a silting up of ravines and the provision of an excellent seed-bed for the dense strong growth of babul which now covers them. The object of the Piprayan plantation is to ascertain the profits which can be obtained from babul plantations on uncultivated, but irrigable waste. The plot covers 162 acres acquired in 1905 at a cost of Rs. 828: operations were commenced in the same year. The seedlings have suffered from the same unfavourable circumstances that have affected those at Kalpi, for both in 1906 and 1907 but little irrigation could be done owing to lack of water in the canal, and so far the plantation has been less successful. In neither is the time of production of bark on a commercial scale yet in sight, and according to the original estimate ten years must still elapse before the trees can be expected to yield a regular annual outturn of it. The scheme contemplates the extension of the Kalpi plantation from time to time as the areas under the operations become fully stocked, but the necessity for doing so has not yet arisen. The average income since the inception has been Rs. 141 and the cost Rs. 21,056: the latter has been increased by the successive misfortunes that have attended the experiment from bad seasons. Since October 1907 the management of both plantations has been in the hands of the forest officer of the Bundelkhand division, who is stationed at Jhansi.\nThe district has no mineral wealth. Stone for masonry is found close to the Betwa, where that river enters the district, and there are two rocky outcrops at Saiyidnagar. Kankar, of poor quality however, exists in abundance in the ravines, and when collected and stacked for road metalling costs Rs. 7 per 100 cubic feet. Kankar lime of good quality burnt with cowdung and refuse costs Rs. 10 per 100 cubic feet, or if burnt with wood Rs. 18. Good timber is practically un procurable in the district. Sal wood for building purposes is imported from Cawnpore at an outlay of Rs. 4 or Rs. 5 per cubic foot, and other good timbers, such as deodar, come from the northern forests. Ordinary ballis and bamboos are readily obtainable from the forest tracts of Jhansi and Lalitpur. Common bricks, for which the bulk of the soil in the district furnishes fair material, $12'' \\times 6'' \\times 3''$, cost Rs. 7 per thousand, and superior table-moulded bricks $9\\frac{1}{2}'' \\times 4\\frac{1}{2}'' \\times 3''$ Rs. 8 to Rs. 10 per 1,000. The same material provides tiles for roofing at an outlay of Rs. 5 per 1,000.\n\nThe wild animals met with are numerous and varied. The tiger is very rare, being only occasionally an intruder from native states to the west. Leopards are not infrequent in the wild country along the larger streams, and in the same localities wolves are found and hyenas are common. All over the black-cotton soil plains the common antelope is met with in large herds, and among ravines the gazelle is plentiful. Jackals and foxes abound and along the riverain tracts. Wild pig are a destructive pest to agriculture. In the jungles of the Rampura jagir the Raja has preserved some spotted deer, but no other cervidae are found in the district. The larger streams support crocodiles, turtles and porpoises. Hares and porcupines, together with various kinds of lizards, snakes and other reptiles, occur in abundance.\n\nThe commoner game birds comprise the grey partridge, smaller sand-grouse, snipe and various kinds of quail. Both the blue rock pigeon and the green pigeon are common, and the ordinary species of doves are abundant. Of the migratory water fowl various kinds of geese, sheldrakes, pochards, duck and teal visit the district in the cold weather, but owing to the scarcity of jhils or tanks are never found in large numbers. The well-known saras is a permanent resident; and the kulan is frequently seen in flocks in the winter. The avifauna include the usual kinds of crows, shrikes, rollers, parrots and passerine birds.\nFish are plentiful in the three chief rivers of the district and comprise the rohu, naini, siland, karonchi, gunch, saur, jhingra, chilwa, anwuri, bachwa, siri, bas, and several other species. They are usually caught with large nets known as mahajal, or others of a smaller description, and with line and rod. But except among the poorer classes living on the banks of the Pahuj, Betwa and Jumna, fish is little used as an article of diet by the people. The chief fishing castes are Kowats, Mallahs and Dhimars, but at the census of 1901 no one was returned exclusively as a fisherman by profession, and those who practise fishing do so only as a subsidiary occupation.\n\nThe domestic cattle of the district are of a generally inferior order. The local animal is weak and stunted, but more substantial zamindars or cultivators occasionally possess imported cattle of some merit costing up to Rs. 200 per pair. The ordinary bullock used for ploughing can be purchased for Rs. 20 to Rs. 25. An attempt made in 1867 to improve the local breeds by the importation of Hissar bulls proved a failure, and a more recent attempt in 1898-1900 at the same object by importing bulls of the Kenwariya stock from Banda and from Kosi in the Muttra district, met with no better success. The chief cattle market is at Kunch: there are also local cattle bazars, the most important being that at Amkhera. The district has probably never been very well stocked with cattle, but it appears to have particularly suffered from the numerous droughts of the last fifteen years. A cattle census taken in 1885 at the time of settlement of the 'Jalaun Tract,' comprising roughly three-quarters of the district, returned 63,654 bullocks and 4,151 bull buffaloes. There were at the same time 24,072 drill ploughs and 22,547 bakhars or hoe ploughs, giving 1\u00b745 animals per plough and a duty of nearly 10 acres per plough. If the number of bakhars is excluded, the proportion of animals rises to 2\u00b782. Fourteen years later in August 1899 a regular stock census was taken, and it was then ascertained that the number of bulls and bullocks was 66,359 and of male buffaloes 2,441, giving a total of 68,800 plough-animals, while there were 29,137 ploughs: the proportion of animals per plough thus averaged 2\u00b735, but in the number of ploughs, that of bakhars does not seem to be included. This census was taken only two years after the severest famine that has ever visited the\ndistrict. At a second enumeration, taken in 1904, a very notable increase of stock was observed. The number of bulls and bullocks had risen to 80,303 and that of male buffaloes to 4,023. This gave a total of 84,326 plough-animals, and as the number of ploughs was 33,454, the proportion of animals had risen to 2:52. All other animals except sheep and ponies had likewise increased, and 60,890 cows, 37,881 cow-buffaloes and 95,442 young stock were recorded. The smallness of the number of male buffaloes is ascribed to the disinclination to use these animals in the plough on the part of all those who consider themselves of the better castes. The district was visited by another severe famine in 1905-06, and though no returns of the number of stock are available all the evidence goes to show that it lost an enormous amount of stock.\n\nHorses, like cattle, are generally imported from the surrounding districts with the exception of the ordinary country ponies. The latter are commonly possessed by the wealthier pattidars and are used for conveyance or as pack-animals. They are usually, however, of the poorest description, and suffer from under-feeding and the lack of good grazing. No attempt has been made to improve the breed of horses by the provision of stallions. The total number of horses and ponics in 1904 was 8,013, the former numbering only 697.\n\nThe returns of 1899 showed a total of 28,137 sheep and 57,068 goats in the district. In 1904 the number of the former had fallen to 25,088, while that of the latter had risen to 81,097\u2014a notable increase. Sheep are principally bred for the market, but large flocks of goats are kept by Gujars, Gadariyas and Ahirs in the ravine tracts of the Jumna, Betwa, and Pahuj where they find excellent pasturage, and are valuable chiefly for their milk, which in the form of ghi still forms an important article of export from the district. Many of these animals are the well-known Jumnapari milch-goats which fetch some Rs. 7 apiece, and are highly prized: they are generally procurable at the chief cattle fairs of the district. The returns also showed 4,646 donkeys, 142 mules and 379 camels. There is no mule breeding, and the donkeys are generally of the most miserable description. Camels are scarce compared with some districts north of the Jumna, but they are usually imported when needed, and do not thrive in the climate of Bundelkhand. Carts, of\nwhich there were 14,183, are relatively numerous, as in other parts of Bundelkhand, but they consist largely of the roughest framework set on wheels, and few, at any rate, of the more substantial cultivators lack one, which they employ mainly in carting produce from their fields.\n\nBesides the losses suffered in years of scarcity and famine, cattle disease carries off numbers of stock every year. The commonest forms of sickness are rinderpest or *mata*; foot and mouth disease called *larha*, *khurphuta* or *kharsita*; anthrax, *bhauran*; and haemorrhagic septic\u00e6mia, called indifferently *garara*, *ponka* and *gurkhai*. Cattle disease occasionally assumes an epidemic character. On such occasions segregation of the affected cattle, and a system of quarantine between the tracts where the diseases first break out and the adjoining villages has done much to prevent their spread. To cope with trouble arising from this source, a peripatetic veterinary assistant is now employed by the district board, and successful efforts to check the spread of rinderpest by inoculation have also been made.\n\nThe climate of Jalaun is as a rule hotter and drier than that of the districts north of the Jumna. The hot weather sets in earlier and lasts somewhat longer; the cold weather is dry and chilly, but frosts are not common. Towards the end of March the hot west winds from the rocky hills and wastes of Gwalior begin to blow and gradually increase in intensity during April and May. Dust-storms are of less frequent occurrence than in the Doab, and the air is generally clearer, a circumstance which tends to intensify the heat of the direct rays of the sun. The rains break normally towards the end of June; but they are frequently delayed and this makes the temperature more trying. The mean annual temperature is approximately $82^\\circ$, the variations ranging from $55^\\circ$ in January to $96^\\circ$ in May, but maximum temperatures as high as $118^\\circ$ are of not infrequent occurrence during the intense and prolonged hot weathers that often prevail. During the rains the air is cooler, but a prolonged break makes the closeness of the atmosphere intolerable from the large amount of water that collects and lies about on the black-soil plains. The general absence of trees and that of vegetation during the hottest time of the year intensifies the dazzling blaze.\nRecords of the rainfall have been regularly maintained at four tahsil headquarters since 1864. According to these the mean annual fall for the district is 31\u00b766 inches, there being little difference among the tahsils. The precipitation in the district is even more variable than is usual in Bundelkhand. Normally the district will not suffer if more than twenty inches fall, provided that these are well distributed; but excessive falls are disastrous to the black-soil tracts, and serious deficiencies are fatal to the entire district. The largest seasonal falls recorded are 62\u00b708 inches at Kalpi in 1894 and 57\u00b780 at the same place in 1888; but there have been some remarkable droughts.* In 1868 an average of only 13\u00b732 inches fell; in 1877, only 14\u00b762; while in 1905 the average for the district did not exceed 11\u00b706 inches, Kunch receiving only 9\u00b724.\n\nThe district is as a whole well drained and is normally healthy; but in the black-soil tracts the people suffer, as in other parts of Bundelkhand, from widespread malarious fevers, induced by the excessive moisture in the ground. An examination of the mortuary returns* affords a fair idea of the comparative healthiness of the tract, though the returns cannot be considered more than approximately accurate till the improved system of compiling statistics was introduced in 1872. From 1877 to 1880 the average recorded number of deaths was 12,639 annually, giving a rate of 31\u00b725 per mille; all those years were normal years and the first of the series an exceptionally healthy one. From 1881 to 1890 the rate rose to 39\u00b797, the average number of recorded deaths being 16,712 annually; but during this period an outbreak of cholera accompanying the scarcity of 1887 doubled the average mortality, and both in 1884 and 1890 the deaths from fever were much above the normal. In the ensuing decade in spite of the excessive mortality in 1897 the death-rate fell to 36\u00b715. During the period from 1901 to 1907 the rate has reached the high figure of 44\u00b792, largely as a result of unprecedented mortality in 1906, when the rate rose to 80\u00b775, cholera having been rampant as a result of the deficient rainfall. The last period has been marked by a succession of calamities and the population which rose between the censuses of 1891 and 1901 has had little chance of making up the ground lost between 1881 and 1891. The birth-rate is in normal years well in excess of the death-rate, but\n\n* Appendix, table III.\nso often has the district suffered from adversity in some form or other that the occasions on which the reverse has been the case are more numerous than in other districts. The average birth-rate from 1891 to 1907 was 42\u00b706 per mille, ranging from 28\u00b777 in 1897 to the high figure of 57\u00b726 in 1904.\n\nIn another table* the number of deaths occurring from the principal forms of disease in each year since 1891 will be found. As is usually the case in other districts fever easily heads the list. The term no doubt includes the majority of diseases in which fever is a symptom rather than a cause, but malarial fever is undoubtedly more prevalent than in the Doab. Abnormally wet years are always marked by a large increase in mortality from this cause, malaria being endemic and most in evidence during the months of September and October. From 1877 to 1907 fever was responsible according to the returns for 71\u00b789 per cent. of the recorded mortality. Occasionally it assumes the proportions of an epidemic, but normally the number of deaths returned under this head closely approximates to 10,000.\n\nCholera is not endemic, but the district seldom escapes one or two deaths from this cause, and it is particularly liable to violent outbreaks in years when the water supply has been reduced owing to a poor monsoon. On two occasions\u2014in 1887 and in 1906\u201423\u00b788 and 14\u00b726 per cent. of the total mortality of the year was attributed to this disease, and in 1884, 1892 and 1897 it carried off considerable numbers of the people. On four occasions during the same period the district has been immune from its attacks, and in all ordinary years it almost entirely disappears or appears in less intensity or only in scattered localities.\n\nThere has been a progressive immunity from small-pox. From 1877 to 1890 the average annual deaths were 260; one severe epidemic occurred in 1883, and three minor attacks in 1878, 1879 and 1884. This gave a rate of 1\u00b781 per cent. on the total number of deaths. The proportion fell to '49 in the succeeding decade. During the latter period the total deaths, if the year 1896 is excluded, only amounted to 60. Since 1900 the rate has increased to '86 per cent. and the mortality has been greater year by year,\n\n---\n\n* Appendix, table IV.\nthough only in 1906 did it assume large proportions. The number of vaccinations appears to have been highest in the decade closing in 1830, when 17,302 people were thus treated annually between 1877 and 1880. From 1881 to 1890 the number fell to 12,896, a figure maintained with little difference in the following decade. For the years from 1901 to 1907 it has risen to 14,341, the increased mortality from this cause having apparently stimulated the desire for a prophylactic.\n\nThe other diseases in the district call for little notice. Dysentery and bowel complaints carry off some persons annually. Dropsy and diarrhoea are common complaints, and together with the gangrenous sore called chakaun are attributable to impure water, bad food or dirty habits, aided by insanitary surroundings. Plague first made its appearance in 1902, eight deaths being reported. In 1904 it assumed more the character of an epidemic and carried off 1,813 people, and in the following year 1,524. In 1906, however, it almost completely disappeared again, and the district may now be said to be free from this scourge.\n\nAt the census of 1881, when statistics of infirmities were first compiled, it was observed there were in the district 169 deaf-mutes, 172 lepers, 1,730 blind persons and 96 lunatics. Ten years later these numbers had changed to 358, 137, 912 and 34 respectively, a decrease under all heads except deaf-mutes. In 1901 there was a decline all round. The district then contained 130 deaf-mutes, 51 lepers, 857 blind persons and 31 lunatics. These numbers are for the most part lower than in other districts of Bundelkhand and call for no special remarks.\nCHAPTER II.\n\nAGRICULTURE AND COMMERCE.\n\nTaken as a whole the agricultural system of the district is not of a high order or on a level with that of the Doab, but cultivation differs in different tracts and all round probably excels the average of Bundelkhand. The people however are poor and for the most part unprogressive, and improvements are but slowly adopted. Preparatory to the burst of the rains the cultivators assemble and conduct a propitiatory ceremony. A bit of ground three or four feet square is prepared and scattered with kharif seed: each man takes a lump from it which he fashions into a ball, and sticks round with chaula twigs, and places in a niche beside his entrance door. Rain is then anxiously awaited, and when it falls cultivation begins in earnest. For cotton and juar the fields are ploughed but once in the month of Asarh; for bajra two preliminary ploughings are given. At the same time rice, kuri, sawan and kakni are put in. During the month of Sawan, if the rains continue favourable, til or tilli is sown. With cotton on light lands arhar, moth, mash, kodon and til are generally intermixed; with juar, til and mung, and with bajra, til and kodon. When juar and bajra are one to two feet high a plough is run through them, forming furrows which loosen the soil around their roots and help to conserve the moisture, the process being called gurna. Kuar is the critical month for the husbandman. Rain is needed at this time to ensure the maturity of the kharif and to enable the rabi crops to be put in. For wheat and gram the soil is turned with the plough on the average four times, but the number of ploughings depends on the status of the cultivator. On the wide cotton plains the crops are when once sown left to ripen as they can, while in rakar villages and more densely populated tracts the crops are more carefully protected from the ravages of wild animals. During November and December autumn crops are gathered, the juar heads being cut off with the sickle and the stalks left standing to be gradually utilized as fodder. During the cold weather Kachhis and\nMuraos raise garden crops close to the hamlets where irrigation is procurable, and cotton is picked. The rati harvest is ready for the sickle by the middle of March, is hastily gathered by swarms of migrating harvesters and then the fields are left to solitude.\n\nIn the black-soil tracts few field boundaries exist to interrupt the long stretches of gram and wheat; their purpose is generally served by thin lines of linseed. The plough duty is high, being 18-36 acres; this denotes an inferior style of cultivation. Fields are imperfectly cleaned, wide irregular bands of grass are left between them, patches of babul scrub and kans are frequently to be seen among the crops. Manure is very little used, and, owing to the scantiness of wood fuel, but little is available. Fortunately the fertile plains of mar do not need it, and their productivity is maintained by sowing no wheat without an admixture of gram.\n\nIn the parwa villages of the north, on the other hand, the population is more dense, reaching 371 per square mile, and superior methods of husbandry prevail, the carelessness that is there occasionally observable being incidental to high caste cultivation. There, too, irrigation is more needed and practised, and the light soil requires manure and regular rotation. Over the whole district, however, the scantiness of population and the prevalence of non-resident or pahi cultivation is a serious bar to agricultural improvement. Everywhere much land is tilled by tenants who live outside the village, and in the case of parganas Kalpi and Orai these come long distances from the Betwa side or from native states. Such a system precludes efficient tillage or the weeding and proper watching of the crops: it fosters the backward state of agriculture so prevalent and encourages the spread of noxious grasses, such as kans, which infest large areas throughout the district and steadily encroach on cultivation. The area under crops of value, such as sugarcane and poppy, is now too small for detailed record.\n\nThe ordinary agricultural implements are the drill plough with its seed tube or nari attached at sowing time, and the bakhar or hoe plough. The latter has a transverse iron blade fixed across the share, and is employed on mar and katar, acting like a scarifier. It is peculiar to western Bundelkhand. The mai is a heavy log, dragged by oxen, on which the operator stands to\nincrease the weight: it is used to crush the clods turned up by the plough in lighter soils but is rarely efficacious in the heavier soils. The other instruments of husbandry include the hansiya or sickle, the khurpa or hoe, the pacha or rake, the phaura or spade, the kulhari or axe and the garasi or chopper.\n\nOn the amawas or 15th day of the Hindu month cattle are never put into the plough: it is their day of rest. The rabi tillage is undertaken with some solemnity. From the date on which sowing commences to that on which it ends, agriculturists eschew the razor and are bound to observe the greatest personal purity. When the task of sowing is concluded they celebrate it by worshipping the drill, and giving away in charity whatever seed grain is left over, this ceremony being performed only on Mondays and Fridays. Worship is first performed in the field where sowings ended and again at home in the hamlet over the drill, when food is also given to the village servants. At the village sites a reversed plough may frequently be seen stuck in the ground with a blackened handi or pitcher placed on the top of the pole. This is supposed to keep off the evil eye, and incense is burned under it by the village jogi if hail is apprehended. Every Tuesday and Thursday Kachhis burn incense for the welfare of their vegetables all the time that they are in season, the ceremony being known as hom-dhup: nor until this duty is performed can any of the produce be reaped. Similarly homage is paid for the sugarcane crop on Kartik Sud ekadashi; and when the cotton crop is beginning to blossom the cultivator prepares a mess of curds and rice and, after invocations, scatters it over the field, in the belief that the pods will become as bright as the glistening mixture itself.\n\nFrom the earliest introduction of British rule in Kunch and Kalpi those portions of the district attained a high degree of development, and many years later Jalaun as a whole ranked among the wealthiest and most fertile districts in the province. Those were the days before the general introduction of canal irrigation, and soils naturally retentive of moisture, such as mar, were highly prized. Its prosperity was mainly due to the profits of the cotton trade of which Kalpi was the principal mart in Upper India, and flourishing trade and a considerable population had their usual effect in enhancing the value of land round the centres\nof trade. Kunch, which was described as \"the garden of the North-West Provinces,\" had 71 per cent. of its total area under cultivation at the settlement of 1842, while the old kanuni tract of Kalpi, extending in a thin strip along the broken banks of the Jumna, had 32 per cent. No early accurate records exist for the partali tract composing the old Jalaun state, but the measurements on which Major Ternan based his settlement in 1863-64 amounted to 432,199 acres, or 61 per cent. of the total area. In 1874, before the depression in the cotton trade set in, no less than 611,858 acres, or 65 per cent. of the total area and 82 per cent. of the culturable area, were under the plough. Ten years later a decline commenced which lasted till 1897. In 1884 the cultivated area fell to 596,799 acres, or 63 per cent. It has never risen since so high again. From 1885 to 1895 it averaged 558,767 acres; it fell to 524,922 in 1896 and to 353,424 in 1897. From that year the district began to make a slow recovery, the seasons alternating between good and bad, and in 1906 the cultivated area once more reached 579,383 acres. Kunch has always been the most highly developed pargana, and in that year had 72 per cent. of its total area under the plough; it is closely followed by Jalaun with 71 per cent. These two subdivisions comprise the western portion of the district, and though they contain much worthless land yet the Pahuj ravines are smaller in extent and less broken in character than those which fringe the Jumna and the Betwa. The two easterly parganas, therefore, form a sharp contrast, Orai having 52 per cent. of its area and Kalpi only 50 per cent. under cultivation.\n\nAs in other districts of Bundelkhand, great as has been the past prosperity of Jalaun the limits of profitable cultivation have never been reached. Kans and the necessity of fallow in poorer lands are always responsible for large areas out of cultivation. In 1874 the culturable area, as distinct from the barren area mentioned in the last chapter, measured 77,339 acres of old waste and 22,416 acres of new fallow. The extent was greatest in Kalpi and Orai and least in Kunch and Jalaun. The relative position of the tahsils has never changed: Kunch has always had the smallest area out of cultivation and Orai has always had the largest. The proportions have increased since 1874: at the present time Kunch\nhas 11\u00b78 per cent., Jalaun 13\u00b78 per cent., Kalpi 19 per cent. and Orai 27\u00b74 per cent. Both the latter tahsils show substantial changes since 1874, when the former had a culturable area out of cultivation of 12 per cent., and the latter of only 14 per cent. The reasons for the increase are not far to seek. Continual loss of population, ever-extending erosion and deterioration, the gradual decline of old markets and flourishing towns, and unequal and excessive revenue assessments, which have always depressed Orai, have had the natural result of throwing large areas out of cultivation as the land became more and more unprofitable to work, or kans invaded the most fertile tracts.\n\nThere are three harvests, the autumn being usually known as siyari and the spring as unhari. The zaid or hot weather crops are insignificant in area and barely average 160 acres over the district. The bulk of the soil being unsuited to them, the water level over most of the tract being deep, and there being no large towns or markets in the district, there is little inducement to raise vegetables and spices. Such as the area is it is found in largest acreage in Kalpi, Jalaun and Orai, and smallest in Kunch. Of the two main harvests the rabi is far the most important as far as the area sown is concerned. In 1874 it covered 352,978 acres or 57\u00b769 per cent. of the area cultivated, as against 258,880 or 42\u00b731 per cent. occupied by the kharif. Though no definite rule can be laid down owing to fluctuations of the areas sown with different crops in accordance with the character of the season, it is still true that the rabi area substantially exceeds the kharif in that proportion. The difference is highest in Orai, where 67 per cent. of the cropped area is usually devoted to rabi, followed by Kunch where it is 62 per cent.: Kalpi comes last with only 50 per cent. Irrigation being little developed and but small areas devoted to rice, it is natural to find that the double-cropped or dofasti area is not of great importance. Though fluctuating, this area shows no development and normally does not exceed 3\u00b76 per cent. of the area under cultivation, ranging from 4\u00b78 per cent. in the light-soil tract of pargana Jalaun to 2\u00b72 per cent. in the black-soil tract of tahsil Orai.\n\nThe chief kharif staples are the millets known as juar and bajra, alone or combined with arhar, and cotton; these three occupy\non an average some 86 per cent. of the entire area cultivated in this harvest. During the years from 1898 to 1900, when fairly normal seasons prevailed or seasons of such a kind as are unlikely to result in the displacement of one crop in favour of another, bajra alone or in combination with arhar covered 41,640 acres, or 19\u00b716 per cent. of the kharif. It is chiefly grown on light sandy parwa soils; and consequently the proportion is much higher in Kalpi and Jalaun than elsewhere, amounting to 32\u00b762 and 26\u00b779 per cent. respectively. Orai follows the latter closely with 25\u00b738 per cent., but Kunch little affects this crop and devotes less than 10 per cent. of the kharif to it. Since 1874 the area of bajra has decreased by approximately one-half. In only 8 per cent. of the area is it sown alone, the proportion rising to one-third in Orai but being insignificant elsewhere.\n\nJuar.\n\nJuar is the great black-soil kharif staple, but in Jalaun it appears to be the practice to mix it far more largely than in other parts of Bundelkhand. As in the case of bajra, it is for the most part mingled with arhar; but being a favourite crop on all classes of land it is found in a large variety of combinations, mung, urd, til and cotton being its chief companions. Alone or in combination with arhar it covers normally 43\u00b742 per cent. of the autumn harvest. Its area has increased since 1874 when it covered 35\u00b728 per cent. of the kharif, the increase being specially marked in Kunch, where it appears to be largely due to the extension of the kharif at the expense of the rabi. The proportion grown alone is less than 3 per cent. of the whole, the lowness of the percentage being attributable to the fact that in Kunch and Orai, where it would normally be grown on black soils unmixed, the people prefer to the devote their fertile mar to rabi crops, while in light soils it is by custom combined in various ways. Juar is usually sown in Sawan and reaped at the beginning of Aghan, the normal outturn over all land being some three maunds per bigha, or approximately 7 maunds per acre, the expense of cultivation as practised in Bundelkhand being not more than Rs. 3 or Rs. 4 per acre. The case is the same with bajra, the outturn being somewhat higher. The small outlay combined with the generous outturn makes both species of millet favourite crops with the inhabitants, whose simple wants they cheaply satisfy.\nThe most valuable autumn product is cotton, which, though still largely grown in all parts of the district, is now but little fancied as a single crop and is found in as many combinations as *juar*. Mixed with *arhar* it covers normally 21-15 per cent. of the *kharif* area, varying from 25 per cent. in Kunch to 18 per cent. in Orai; the latter proportion is a little exceeded in Kalpi and Jalaun. Cotton is commonly sown at the end of *Asarh*; but the period is a restricted one, and any postponement of the rains is unfavourable to the devotion of a large area to it. Hence the fluctuations are very great. But apart from seasonal variations, the time has now long since departed when this staple of Jalaun was the finest in the market. Writing in 1842 Mr. (afterwards Sir William) Muir stated: \"The cotton plant grows to great perfection in Bundelkhand; and its produce is not only more abundant, but also of a softer texture and of a whiter colour than that of the Doab: hence it bears a higher price and is more eagerly sought after.\" At that time nearly one-half the *kharif* harvest of Kunch and nearly one-third of that of Kalpi consisted of cotton, and later in 1874 over 29 per cent. in the entire district was occupied by it. The expenses of cultivation were small, while the value of the produce was proportionately large, the output being estimated over all soils at between four and five maunds an acre, worth some Rs. 17. Among the various soils the outturn on *mar* is pre-eminent, being estimated at $3\\frac{1}{2}$ maunds of clean cotton per acre compared with 2 on *parwa* and $1\\frac{1}{2}$ on *rakar*. Since the decline in prices and the introduction of canal irrigation, this crop has been to a certain extent displaced by cereals, but it still covers in Jalaun a higher proportionate acreage than in any other district of Bundelkhand, and the produce finds a ready market in Cawnpore, which has now taken the place of Kalpi as the chief mart of Upper India.\n\nOther *kharif* crops are of very little importance: *til*, which has increased in area in the rest of Bundelkhand, has made little headway yet in Jalaun. The area occupied by rice and the coarser early millets is insignificant, and the acreage under *mung*, *urd* and *moth* is lost in the combinations with *juar* and cotton. *Kodon* occupies some 800 acres annually, chiefly in Kalpi and Orai. In 1906 there were still 530 acres devoted to sugarcane, all which except 13 acres were in tahsil jalaun. Here the light *parwa* soil\nadmits of closer and more intense cultivation, and if a regular supply of water is assured from the canal the area will without doubt expand. In 1874 there were 2,989 acres covered by this crop: the settlement officer counted at that time 157 stone sugar presses or kolhuas scattered over Kunch, and says that the tradition of cultivation of cane, in the course of which the young plants had to be protected from the rays of the sun by a covering of dhak leaves, still lingered among the people. This bespeaks a higher degree of energy than is observable among the people now; but the expenses of cane cultivation are great and the return on outlay is too long postponed for this crop to be planted except by the more well-to-do tenants. Indigo is still grown, chiefly in Orai and Kunch, and in 1906 it occupied 114 acres. The area varies from year to year, but is generally maintained, the dye being employed in the preparation of local cloths. It is grown in exceptional circumstances: when a field is taken up, a cultivator, if a tenant-at-will, has to stipulate for three years' rent, and the soil chosen is generally mar or superior kubar and parwa. Garden crops are of small importance and cover an insignificant area in all tahsils.\n\nThe great rabi staple of the district is without doubt gram. The extent to which it is mixed with wheat depends entirely on the season, the average acreage occupied by the latter crop alone being only 612 acres. In a normal year, such as 1906, the area under the mixed crop exceeds that under gram alone in every tahsil except Kalpi, and varies from 68\u00b76 and 65\u00b76 in Kunch and Orai to 44\u00b70 and 33\u00b77 per cent. in Jalaun and Kalpi, or a total for the district of 53\u00b72 per cent. on the entire rabi area. The bulk of the wheat sown is of the red or kathia variety; though coarser than the white or pisiya wheat, it requires less irrigation and attention. Pisiya is grown on light soil, where irrigation is procurable, and is less liable to rust. The area of gram alone, which expands largely in dry years owing to its drought-resisting qualities, covered in the same year 26\u00b724 per cent., ranging from 18 per cent. in Konch and Orai to 26\u00b72 per cent. in Jalaun and 44\u00b74 per cent. in Kalpi. When the two crops are mixed they are thoroughly blended and drilled into the earth together, the object of the combination being twofold. In the first place the crops are affected in different ways by the prejudicial influences of season, an important factor in\ncountry where the soil is entirely dependent on the distribution of the rainfall. The mixture partakes of the nature of an insurance, the thrifty cultivator being thus certain of obtaining some sort of harvest. In the second place, rich as the best soils are, they would be unable to withstand for very long the exhausting effects of wheat; and in the black-soil tracts, where year after year a crop is taken off the same field without the application of manure, the benefits of rotation and fallows are simultaneously obtained through planting the leguminous crop in combination with the wheat. The explanation of the effects, which the cultivator has learnt to appreciate from experience, is now well known to scientists, and the custom of mingling different plants is rather a wise precaution than an indication of indifferent husbandry. The need for insurance, too, is enhanced by the great likelihood of much-dreaded rust destroying the entire wheat crop in the early spring. The average cost of production of wheat may be reckoned at Rs. 10 to Rs. 14 per acre, and the average outturn at 6 to 7 maunds per acre; but in exceptional tracts this average is much exceeded, if climatic conditions have been favourable. Gram requires less tilth and is a cheaper crop: at the same time the bushy plants that luxuriate in good seasons over the good mar soil give a produce of upwards of 15 maunds per acre. On the other hand much is planted on light dry soil where the plants are stunted and the output often does not exceed two to three maunds per acre. Linseed is a crop of some importance: rarely are wheat fields left without a fringe of this plant along the boundaries, and its chief use is to supply home needs. It is also sown alone, but not to a great extent, and covered 20,674 acres or 7-3 per cent. of the rabi area in 1906, ranging from nearly 10 per cent. in Jalaun to less than 4 per cent. in Kalpi. Other spring crops are of little importance: small acreages are occupied by dhaniya or coriander seed (which if not irrigated is grown on the best mar soil), zira or caraway, ajwain or Bishop's weed(carum copticum), turmeric, chillies, garden crops and poppy. The last named covered 1,666 acres in 1904, two-thirds of which was in Jalaun. Barley is not much grown alone, but, in combination with gram, it is a more favourite crop, the mixture, to which peas are generally added, being called bejhar. In 1906 this occupied 21,301 acres or over 7 per cent. of the rabi area, while that of barley\nand wheat, called *gojai*, covered 3,618 acres or less than 2 per cent.\n\nThe cultivation of plants yielding dyes used in former days to be an extended industry connected with the manufacture of country cloths. In 1874 there were 257 acres occupied by *kusum* or safflower and 1,037 acres by *al*, the former producing a yellow and the latter a red dye. The industry has since been killed by the introduction of aniline dyes, but a description of the cultivation of *al* is of some interest as indicative of the former high development of agriculture in the district. The crop was most favoured in the old parganas of Ata, Kunch and Orai, and the soils most fancied for its growth were *mar* and *habar*. As soon as the rains began the field destined for *al* was dug 1\u00bd foot deep with a *kudali*, an operation which cost from Rs. 3 to Rs. 5 per *bigha* according to the previous condition of the soil. After a shower the clods were broken up and the field levelled with a *phaora* at an outlay of some eight annas per *bigha*. The surface was next ploughed with the *bakhar*, and thoroughly cleaned; finally the field was sown in the beginning of July, each *bigha* requiring a maund of seed costing normally Rs. 4 or Rs. 5. Within a month the plants sprouted, and the soil was kept thoroughly clean by repeated weeding. In the second year the soil was twice turned up in July with the *kudali* or the *khurpa*, great care being taken not to injure the young plants, which flowered when a year old, and at the end of the season the seed-pods were gathered and stored in heaps. During the third year, after rain had fallen in July, the surface soil was once more loosened, and during the ensuing January, February and March the field was dug up in order to obtain the roots. The value of the latter varied according to their depth, the lowest roots giving the most brilliant dye and growing to a depth of some 4\u00bd feet below the ground. The produce per *bigha* was estimated at four maunds, the deepest roots called *baro* producing 1\u00bd maunds, the medium roots called *jhavan* 1\u00bd and the upper roots called *gathiya* one maund. The value of the first amounted to Rs. 12 per maund, that of the second to Rs. 6 and that of the third to not more than Re. 1 or Re. 1-4-0. From these the dye was extracted by first cutting them into pieces, and then drying and pounding them in a hand-mill. The method of cultivation, which entailed considerable expense and a postpone-\nment of direct return on outlay for three years, was valuable as enriching the soil with organic matter and increasing its productivity by the deep digging which it necessitated.\n\nWith a view to studying the local conditions of agriculture and subsequently offering assistance to cultivators, a Government agricultural station was established at Orai in 1905. The station lies at a short distance from the town and covers 81 acres of land, composed of four blocks, representative of the main soils of the district. It is in charge of a superintendent, an officer of the subordinate agricultural service, who is controlled by the Deputy Director of Agriculture in charge of the central circle. Besides being the scene of experiments to test the adaptability of various staples or varieties to the soils, to eradicate kans and in connection with other matters, the results of which are yearly published, the station serves as a centre for the distribution of seed and of implements, and as a bureau of information for the agriculturists of the locality.\n\nBefore the introduction of canals, and for many years after, the district was extremely backward in the matter of irrigation and has always been exceedingly sensitive to droughts. The water level throughout is low, varying according to rough observations from between 50 and 70 feet in the central lowlying tract to 90 feet and more on the higher land round the extremities. Consequently wells as a source of supply have always been comparatively few. In considering the subject of irrigation in this district, however, it must be remembered that retention of moisture in so much of the soil renders a watering in a normal year unnecessary. Besides this the practice of embanking uneven ground has had the effect of protecting considerable areas from the worst effect of drought, especially in the broken tracts along the rivers, where direct irrigation is ordinarily impossible. This system of protection is one well known to the people in Bundelkhand; and in Jalaun, as in other districts, it is now being methodically developed under the control of the irrigation department. Besides protecting the soil from drought, embankments arrest scour and erosion. During the last few years a sub-overseer of the irrigation department has been attached to the district, selecting suitable sites both for embankments and for tanks. During the famines of 1906 and 1908 a large number of these works were carried out, and in the future the bulk\nof the village relief works will take this form. Hitherto, however, direct tank irrigation has played but a small part in the agriculture of the district; that from \"other sources\" is necessarily very restricted; while the bulk of the area watered from wells has always existed in the tract of country where parwa soil prevails, now included for the most part in tahsil Jalaun. If we accept the year 1905-06 as one indicative of the highest degree of development which the district has attained, it will be found that tahsil Jalaun has a larger irrigated area than all other tahsils put together, the proportion there rising to 3.61 per cent.: at the other extreme is the broken tahsil of Kalpi with less than 1 per cent. Only in tahsil Jalaun is anything in the shape of a kacheha well possible; elsewhere the great depth of water below the surface necessitates the provision of masonry cylinders. Of the 2,723 wells available for irrigation in the year 1906, 1,247 were non-masonry: of these 1,015 were found in Jalaun tahsil.\n\nThe Betwa canal was opened for irrigation in the kharif of 1885. Sanguine hopes were expressed at settlement of 1887 of the benefits likely to result from it, and \"the transformation of the face of the country, giving the fertility and variety of a garden to its present rude style of cultivation\" was predicted. Irrigation from it has undergone strange vicissitudes. In the early days of the canal cultivators in the black-soil tracts, which are for the most part commanded by the canal, were averse to the utilisation of its water. In the parwa tracts on the other hand, where the soil responds more readily to irrigation, and where the system of agriculture was always closer and more adaptable to circumstances, there was no such hesitation. Writing in 1888 the executive engineer remarked that the inhabitants of the latter tract had readily availed themselves of the canal, whereas in other places there had been a feeling of apathy or marked caution. The development, however, was much hampered by the shortage of water in the kharif. In the early days of the canal it was found possible to supply water for sugarcane, and the area under this crop rose from 993 acres in 1886 to 2,540 acres in 1889: but as the demand for the rati crop increased water could no longer be supplied, and irrigation of sugarcane had to be derived from wells. From 1885 to 1894 an average of 21,113 acres, or only 3.80 per cent. of the total cultivated\narea, was irrigated from canals. Very little was done in the predominantly wet season of 1894, but the next few years saw a remarkable development and the famine year of 1897 marks a turning point in the history of canal irrigation in the district, no less than 81,658 acres or 23\u00b710 per cent. of the area under the plough having been watered in that year. If this year be excluded, it is found that the average irrigated area from 1896 to 1901 was 37,425 acres, or 7\u00b727 per cent of that cultivated. From these figures it would appear that the value of irrigation in mar and heavy katar soils was first brought home to the people of the district during the abnormally dry year of 1897. A further impetus was given to the extension of irrigation in 1902 by an improvement in the supply of water; for in that year the Parichha reservoir was provided with shutters on the weir, which greatly increased its capacity; and from 1902 to 1906 the average acreage watered was 79,071 acres, or 15\u00b718 per cent. of the cultivated area. In a year such as 1906, when the monsoon is normal, the northern parganas Jalaun and Kalpi, with 11\u00b715 and 8\u00b715 per cent respectively, have far the largest canal irrigated areas. On the other hand the canal commands a much larger area in Kunch than elsewhere, and in the dry year of 1905 that tahsil availed itself of water to the extent of 40 per cent. of its cultivated area. In any circumstances Orai irrigates the smallest acreage.\n\nThe Betwa canal originates from the Betwa river at Parichha, a village in the jagir of Tori Fatehpur, some 14 miles northeast of Jhansi. The weir which controls the supply is situated within one mile of the metalled road from Jhansi to Cawnpore. The total length of the weir (including a small island in the centre of the river) is 4,246 feet, its crest being 631\u00b78 feet above sea level, and on an average 25 feet above the normal level of the river bed inside it. The reservoir formed thereby extends for some 17 miles above the weir, and when full is 21\u00bd feet above canal head floor. The canal on issuing runs at a low level through the Moth tahsil of Jhansi for 19\u00bd miles in a northeasterly direction, and at the village of Pulia, just beyond Moth, bifurcates into two branches. The western branch, called the Kuthaund, runs for 50 miles on a watershed between the Pahuj river and the main drainage system of the Jalaun district. The\nfirst 14 miles are, with the exception of a very insignificant length in an outlying village of Moth, in the Samthar state. It passes into Kunch at the village of Kailia, cuts through an intruding portion of Datia state, and continues northwards west of Madhogarh to Rampura. At this point it turns sharply to the east along a minor watershed parallel to the Jumna, and after a course of 65\u00bd miles tails into some ravines leading to that river near the village of Randhirpur in the Jalaun pargana. Its total length within the Jalaun district is 44\u00bd miles. The eastern branch, called the Hamirpur, after running 15 miles through Samthar territory curves to the east five miles before it reaches the district border at Ingoi, in tahsil Kunch. It follows the watershed between the Betwa and the central drainage system, and after a course of 83 miles, in the latter part of which its direction veers round to due east, cuts across Baoni territory and discharges its surplus water into the Jumna through some ravines approximately five miles west of the civil station of Hamirpur. Of the total length 46 miles lie within Jalaun. From both branches distributaries take off at frequent intervals and, with few exceptions, follow a line running into the interior of the district with a northerly trend along the natural slope, and are so aligned as to command as far as possible the lighter soils; but a large portion of the area is necessarily heavy black soil. The culturable area commanded by the canal in the district is estimated at 714,700 acres, but in 1907 not more than 160,000 were reckoned as irrigable from it. Distributaries and minors with a total length of 396\u00bd miles have been so far provided, making the extent of channels in the district 487\u00bd miles. The total cost of the headworks was Rs. 3,04,463 and the canal was built entirely as a protective work, but not till the famine of 1896-97 did it pay anything on the outlay. The supply of water which has hitherto proved insufficient in years of drought for full watering in both harvests will shortly be enormously increased by the completion of a second weir at Dukhwan in the Jhansi district. It is now admitted that the Betwa canal will not give water for early kharif sowings until a third reservoir is built.\n\nFamines. It is little likely that a district which is so dependent on the rainfall could be otherwise than extremely sensitive to droughts, but we have no record of how it suffered during the well-known\ncalamities of early days, or even how far it was affected by the great chalisa in 1783. Even after the cession in 1803 only the portion comprised in the old pargana of Kunch and the irregular strip of land along the Jumna, known as pargana Kalpi, came under British rule. The first famine in this tract of which we have any mention is that of 1813, but no details are given of the amount of distress prevalent. In 1819 there appears to have been a severe scarcity aggravated by a general prevalence of high prices, and we read of exports being ordered from Aligarh and Agra to Kalpi. By Kalpi must be understood at this time western Bundelkhand, comprising all Hamirpur as well as parganas Kalpi and Kunch. The kharif is said to have failed entirely and the rubi to have been destroyed by frost. Some remissions of revenue were given; but the uncollected balances were large, and the distress is said to have been very greatly increased by the high assessment of Mr. Waring.\n\nThe famine of 1833-34 is known to have been a severe one in western Bundelkhand, comprising the parganas of Kalpi, Kunch, Hamirpur and Jalalpur. Famine, pestilence and emigration are said to have deprived the district of half its population; large alienations of property occurred and villages became rapidly deserted. Mr. Muir, writing in 1842, says that out of about 75,000 houses in that portion of the district some 38,000 were abandoned. A certain sum of money was set aside by the Government for the relief of the destitute, and by November 1834 Rs. 20,150 were spent in the Bundelkhand division; besides this considerable sums of land revenue were remitted or suspended.\n\nAn even severer affliction fell upon the district in common with a large part of the North-Western Provinces in 1837-38. The rains were unusually late; little fell in July and August and the intense heat was relieved by heavy but most unequally distributed falls in September. The distress appears to have been more severe in the east than in the west, but pargana Kalpi suffered severely, and as early as November tahsildars were authorized to suspend month by month whatever sums were deemed proper with reference to the existing state of respective villages. On December 7th Rs. 2,000 were requested for gratuitous distribution, but the Government declined at this early stage to authorize such\npayments; the distress continued to increase and emigration to Saugor and other neighbouring places was considerable. On February 9th, 1838, the Magistrate was empowered to intervene actively by employing the destitute on works of public utility at rates which would allow nothing more than the barest means of subsistence. The work at Kalpi was principally on tanks, roads and wells, but the opportunity was also taken to repair various thanas and tahsildars and to construct a few serais. As soon as it was known that employment was to be had the poor flocked to the scenes of labour, and even those who had emigrated came back. Many of the applicants at Kalpi were men from the Doab and the Jalaun state, and also the wives and children of artizans who still continued to ply their trades in the town. After a time applicants from the Doab and emigrants from native states were weeded out, and by this means the daily numbers, which between February 15th and 24th had swelled to over 6,900, were reduced to an average of about 2,900 in March and 3,000 in April. At a later date natives of foreign states were by the orders of Government admitted to work on the same conditions as British subjects. The entire amount disbursed by Government for these operations amounted to Rs. 46,694, but this sum was spread over the whole district: Rs. 3,94,777 of land revenue were ultimately remitted.\n\nThe next famine that afflicted the district came in 1868. The rain ceased on August 8th and a prolonged break ensued till the middle of September, when rain fell abundantly. Only about one-third of the autumn crops escaped destruction and the rabi of 1869 was estimated at one-half the average or a little more. The failure of the harvest was not severe enough to produce absolute famine, but scarcity and distress prevailed till the rains broke in 1869, parganas Orai and Jalaun being the worst affected. In both these tracts suspension of a large portion of the demand was authorized and at the close of the year 1868-69, Rs. 2,57,256 or 28 per cent. of the demand, were outstanding and generally regarded as irrecoverable. There was however no emigration nor danger of failing stocks, and the surplus stores of the Doab poured through Kalpi in large quantities, the imports being estimated at 400,000 maunds. No regular system of poorhouses was established, but at Orai uncooked rations of half a ser for an adult and a quarter of a\nser for each child were distributed under the orders of the assistant commissioner. From May 1st to September 30th a daily average of 130 persons was thus relieved at a cost of Rs. 1,115 met from local contributions. Private charity at Kalpi also supported monthly from February to May 48,600 persons, or in the gross 192,000; these were employed in the construction of a new marketplace, in cleaning cotton and other miscellaneous work. At Kunch alms were given in the shape of rations for two months at a cost of Rs. 300, and some relief works were also undertaken: these between September 4th 1868 and the end of July 1869 supported a daily average of 1,606 persons at a cost of Rs. 13,700. In pargana Orai 1,773 persons were employed on town drainage during September and October 1869; and in pargana Ata from February till the end of October an average of 129 persons were employed, at a cost of Rs. 2,464, on deepening a tank and improving a road. The total cost of relief operations undertaken by the Government in the district was estimated at Rs. 18,649, for which a daily average of about 1,800 people was occupied for periods varying between one and a half and six months of the most critical time of the year 1869, and a daily average of 130 was gratuitously relieved for five months. At the same time the agricultural population is known to have suffered great hardships: in cattle alone they are calculated to have lost one-third by starvation; in many villages plough-bullocks ceased to be procurable, and the soil was turned up by the hoe. Prices were extremely high for the period: wheat rose from 13 sers to as much as 7 sers 4 chhatanks, gram to 9 sers 3 chhatanks, and juar to 9 sers for a rupee.\n\nThe rainfall of the year 1877 was extremely bad; by August 20th an average of only 3-8 inches had fallen as against a normal of 23-7. This amount was insufficient to admit of any extended sowings, and in the end only some 17,000 acres of kharif were put down against a normal of 260,000 acres: the preceding rabi had been an unprecedentedly good one, however, and enabled the people to bear up against the threatened distress, for though their common food (the coarser millets) was almost unprocurable, wheat was still over 17 and gram at 21 sers for a rupee. August 20th approximately marked the turn of the tide. The sown crops had completely dried up, flocks of emigrants began to set their faces\ntowards Malwa, and credit became contracted. Distress first appeared in Madhogarh and Jalaun, but soon spread to Kalpi, Orai and Kunch. In the latter half of August all available money out of local funds was given for utilization in the towns of Orai, Saiyidnagar, Kotra, Jalaun, Kuthaund and Madhogarh, with the object of giving work to the poor, and as much work as could be provided from the sanctioned budget was given out by the public works department pending sanction to a preliminary list of projects for relief works which was submitted to the Commissioner. These relief works, on sanction being given, were opened in the following month and supported a daily average of 754 persons from September to March. In the latter month, as the people left the works for harvesting operations, these were temporarily closed; but as ordinary labour became contracted, distress reappeared in Orai and Jalaun and relief works were reopened on May 26th. The daily average rose to 998 and continued to increase throughout that month, and remained stationary during July. Towards the middle of August, as the rain permitted of agricultural operations, the numbers rapidly decreased and by the end of September all works were closed. A poorhouse opened at Orai on January 30th 1878 remained open till May 26th; it was then closed owing to the dwindling of the inmates to only 26, but it was reopened on June 26th and from start to finish relieved 2,549 persons. On the relief works from May 26th till September 30th 712 persons on an average received daily relief; and it was estimated that an aggregate of 214,939 persons obtained employment on the ordinary district public works.\n\nThe next similar calamity that visited the district was the scarcity of 1896, which culminated in the famine of 1897. The rainfall of the monsoon of 1895 began well but ceased prematurely, though an average of 35.35 inches fell over the district during the year. The result of this was that the kharif was injured and the rabi was poor: it was reckoned that only about two thirds of the rabi area were sown. Distress among the agricultural population began to show itself at the beginning of 1896. As a first step towards relief Rs. 60,000 of the kharif instalment of revenue of 1896 was submitted for remission and no less than Rs. 2,85,00 for the rabi, while Rs. 36,581 were distributed as takavi. Poorhouses\nwere opened at the headquarters of three tahsils in February and March, and in April sundry relief works were started, both under the control of the public works department and under that of the civil authorities. The breaking of the monsoon at the normal period enabled all those, however, to be closed at the end of June, with the exception of poorhouses, which contained 245 inmates in the middle of July. In the civil department Rs. 36,646 were expended on village works, Rs. 4,370 on poorhouses and Rs. 4,731 on gratuitious relief through patwaris.\n\nThe monsoon of 1896, after commencing very well, ceased early: only 5\u00b765 inches fell in July against a normal of 12\u00b718, 6\u00b761 inches in August against a normal of 10\u00b707 and only 1\u00b717 inches in September. None fell in October, and as November passed away rainless it soon became apparent that the district was destined to be involved in widespread distress. The poorhouses could not be closed and it was found impossible to stop gratuitous relief. In October relief works again had to be started, and as the days passed by general relief measures on a gigantic scale had to be adopted: these did not come to an end until September 1897. At the end of October 1896 no grain was selling cheaper than 10 seers to the rupee. An unusually large area, 291,190 acres, compared with a normal of 204,751, was sown with kharif in 1896: much of this never came to maturity the estimated outturn on the whole being about five annas only. The rabi area of 1896-97 was calculated to be about one-third of the normal. A total sum of Rs. 10,74,065 due on account of land revenue was suspended, out of which Rs. 8,31,899, or 77\u00b745 per cent., were proposed for remission, while Rs. 1,27,778 were distributed during the year as takavi. The numbers on large works under the control of the public works department, which amounted to 4,667 on October 31st 1896, rose steadily till they reached a total of 97,053 on May 29th; after this they rapidly decreased. Altogether 15,206 110 units were relieved at a cost of Rs. 10,69,202 on these works from their inception to their final closing. At the same time the number of those relieved by the civil authorities on works, in poorhouses or in their own homes rose pari passu, and on May 29th 18,863 persons were relying on the bounty of Government. The total charges incurred by the district officer in this connection amounted to Rs. 2,90,780.\nThe daily average of persons relieved amounted to 44,063 on public works, and 12,606 on works under civil agency or on the gratuitous relief lists for the twelve months during which the distress lasted. Though Jalaun did not suffer so severely as Banda or Hamirpur, it is impossible to realize adequately the effects of this appalling calamity. Cattle died in thousands, and this loss coming, as it did, after a succession of bad seasons left the people thoroughly impoverished. In addition to the direct relief afforded by Government to the people, remittances amounting to Rs. 3,42,600 were received from the provincial committee of the Indian Famine Charitable Relief Fund. Out of this sum, to which Rs. 600 locally subscribed must be added, Rs. 3,41,702 were spent in giving blankets and clothing to the poor, and in providing impoverished cultivators and artisans with seed, cattle and implements. The distribution of this sum did much to mitigate the hardships of those who, when the monsoon of 1897 restored normal conditions, desired to return to their ordinary avocations.\n\nThe special treatment that the district received in settlement and legislation, and the favourable seasons which followed the famine of 1896-97, left the people better able to face the next calamity, which visited Bundelkhand and the Agra division in 1906. The rainfall of 1905 in these tracts was the lowest on record, and the Jalaun district was the first to show signs of distress. The kharif harvest of 1905 was almost a total failure and, except where irrigation was possible, rabi could not be sown. A test work, opened as early as September 13th, had by the end of October attracted over 3,000 workers, and famine was declared with effect from November 1st. From that day onwards relief of all kinds was freely given till the 21st of October 1906, when those remaining on the gratuitous relief lists were dismissed with valedictory doles; actual works were closed at the end of July. During this period the numbers on works under the control of the public works department reached their highest total with 61,584 on April 21st, but those who were being relieved by the district officer on works, in poorhouses or in their homes increased greatly at the commencement of July, and amounted to 45,732 in the first week in September. The total expenditure on this occasion was Rs. 6,85,410 incurred by the public works department and\nRs. 4,32,762 incurred by the civil authorities, making a grand total of Rs. 11,18,172. But in addition to this sum Rs. 9,20,000 of various instalments of land revenue due were remitted and Rs. 4,10,332 were advanced from state funds for the purchase of seed, bullocks, the construction of wells, petty works and for maintenance. The scarcity of fodder and water during this famine was greater than that experienced during the famine of 1896-97 and has been described as unprecedented. Not only did tanks and wells and other local sources of water supply become quickly exhausted, but even the Betwa canal actually failed for a time. Old men who remembered the famines of 1868-69, 1877-78 and 1896-97 told the Collector that \"in none of them was fodder so scarce, and that though juar in those years produced no heads there was much stalk everywhere and that grass did not fail so completely.\" Trees were stripped of their leaves to feed the cattle and even chopped-up thorns were used for this purpose. The price of fodder was so high that a bullock or a cow would soon eat more than its value, and when the local supply became exhausted the people were forced to sell their cattle at less than one-third of the usual price. Some idea of the extent of these sales may be gained from the fact that in the Kunch market no fewer than 119,682 horned cattle were sold during the year ending 31st March 1906, and 48,600 were slaughtered, as compared with 33,641 cattle sold and 11,779 slaughtered in the preceding year. The rain in the middle of February 1906 and the rabi harvest gave some relief, but very little, and it was not until the rains of 1906 had broken that the suffering endured by the cattle came to an end. Even then many perished, being unable in their weakened and emaciated state to withstand the damp and cold of the monsoon weather. To meet the situation grass was cut and stacked in the Jhansi forests and thence imported and sold in the district at five to six annas per maund; and large advances of takuvi were also made for the maintenance of bullocks engaged in irrigating the spring harvests; and later the people were further assisted by advances of takuvi and by grants from the Charitable Fund to purchase cattle to replace those they had lost.\n\nOnly one year passed before the district suffered its next and most recent visitation. In 1907 the rains were late in starting\nand did not become established till the third week in July; in that month only 3.72 against a normal of 11.31 inches fell. The precipitation continued almost uninterruptedly during August, and slightly exceeded the average, but then ceased: only 9 cents were recorded in September and none in October. Wheat, which was selling at 12 sers per rupee in July 1907, rose to 7 sers in December, while jwar rose to 8\u00bd sers. The kharif crops withered in the scorching blaze of September; and the outturn was estimated as only 11 per cent. of the normal, while the rabi harvest did not exceed 17 per cent., even this result being largely due to irrigation. During the course of the year Rs. 6,75,710 of land revenue were remitted and Rs. 2,69,597 distributed in takavi, as indirect measures of relief. Famine was officially recognised in the district on December 22nd 1907, when direct measures of relief were started in the shape of works on raising roads, deepening tanks and erecting field embankments for able-bodied labourers, and gratuitous distributions of money to the poor in their own homes or of food in poorhouses and kitchens. On the 29th December 9,727 persons were being relieved on works under the control of the public works department, and the number increased rapidly till it reached its highest point with 66,597 on the 25th of April 1908; it then gradually decreased till the final closing of the works at the end of June. At the end of December 1,755 persons were in receipt of relief from the civil authorities, and this number increased to 10,249 on May 30th. Owing to the gradual closing of relief works and the relaxing of the conditions of gratuitous relief this number rose to 28,490 on 27th June. At the end of August the recipients were dismissed with valedictory doles and direct measures of relief were concluded. The total number of persons relieved during the famine was 12,484,816 and the total expenditure incurred from the commencement to the close of operations amounted to the sum of Rs. 11,32,000. As a whole this famine was somewhat more severe than that of 1905-06, but considerably less so than that of 1897. In one important respect it differed from its immediate predecessor, for the anticipated scarcity of fodder was not so great and only 32,000 cattle were disposed of at Kunch. Nevertheless 11,407 maunds of grass were baled at Dhaurra station from the Jhansi forests.\nand exported to this district, where it was sold or advanced as takwvi at an average price of five annas per maund. A total sum of Rs. 84,390, out of which Rs. 71,500 were received from the provincial committee of the famine relief fund, were spent in providing clothes or medical comforts for the poor, and in helping respectable but indigent persons and parda-nashin women in towns.\n\nThe most noticeable feature in the earliest records of prices are the discrepancies among the various centres of trade. Nor is this result surprising considering the land-locked nature of the tract and the wretched state of the communications. In 1854, when Jalaun was first formed into a district, wheat was selling at 30 sers for a rupee or over in Orai and Kunch and 22 sers in Jalaun and Madhogarh, differences in the prices of other food grains being in proportion. Conversely in 1860, while only 17 sers could be purchased for a rupee in Kunch, 33 were procurable in Jalaun and 38 in Ata. It is clear from these figures that while what were then regarded as famine prices obtained in one part of the district plenty reigned a few miles away, the obstacles in the way of traffic being too great to ensure an adjustment to an approximately common level. Another point brought into relief by the records is the violent fluctuation from year to year, according as the seasons were good or bad: thus wheat, which sold at over 30 sers per rupee at Kunch in 1859, rose to 17 sers in 1860 and fell to 28 sers again the following year. Practically it may be said that each local area was dependent on its own resources for its food supplies. The general level of prices at this period is indicated by those prevailing for the main food grains at the chief centres of trade in 1861-65. At that time the average price of wheat was 22 sers, of gram 28 sers, of juar 26 sers and of arhar 31 sers per rupee. During the two following decades these followed the general trend of prices found elsewhere. In 1885 a rise took place throughout the province; but in 1889 the railway was opened in the district, and this, combined with the rapid improvement in the internal communications, operated more than any other cause in bringing prices to a permanently higher level. For the five years from 1891 to 1895 the average price of wheat was 15\u00bd sers, of gram 23 sers, of juar 21 sers and of arhar 25 sers per rupee, representing a rise of approximately 22 per cent. during\nthe thirty years that elapsed between the period immediately following the restoration of order after the Mutiny, and that following the opening of the railway. The normal rates now existing for the same articles are reckoned at 14 sers for wheat, 21 sers for gram, 23 sers for juar and 11 sers for arhar; but the district has, during the repeated scarcities and famines of the years since 1896, recorded much higher rates than these. Generally it may be said that since 1895 prices have only slightly increased though the disturbances in famine years have been great.\n\nCommensurate with the changes in prices has come a large increase in wages. In 1858 the wages of carpenters, headmasons, masons, blacksmiths, beldars and tailors were two annas a day, except in and near the town of Kalpi where they rose to half an anna more. In 1873 the wages of tailors were five annas, of carpenters and headmasons four annas, of blacksmiths four to five annas, of common masons, beldars and water-carriers two to three annas, the rise having been particularly rapid in the previous five years. One of the main causes assigned for this was the increase in the price of the necessaries of life that took place in the decade 1861-70, accentuated by the famine of 1868. Another was found in the loss of population resulting from the same famine and the large calls made on the labouring classes for work on railways and other large enterprises, which denuded the district of many hands and left labour un procurable except at greatly enhanced rates. Even in 1874 the complaint was heard that workmen of any description were obtained only with great difficulty, while many of the lower orders had taken to agricultural pursuits which made them independent of general labour. It was further alleged that before the annexation of Oudh numerous people, to avoid oppression in that province, used to flock to this district for employment, but that under British administration they found profit and comfort in their own homes and ceased to come. In the villages wages were paid partly in food and partly in cash, the monthly rates being Re. 1-8-0 together with a daily present of two cakes of bread from July to October, Re. 1-4-0 and the same quantity of food from November to February, and Re. 1 with the above food from March till June; but in 1874 no ploughman would accept less than Rs. 3 to Rs. 4 per mensum. The village servants such as the\nblacksmith, carpenter, potter and washerman generally received haraiti\u2014that is, an allowance of one or two ser of grain for a plough, in lieu of cash wages, at the autumn sowing season, and at the harvest nine bundles of the produce. At the rabi sowings in Kuar nine double hand-fulls were given to the same person per plough from the seed, while daily labourers in the fields generally received a dibia or small bundle of the produce. Weeding was paid for at the rate of one anna six pies for a man and one anna for woman or child. Since 1874 the wages of labourers and artizans have undergone a further increase. General labourers now receive 2\u00bd annas for a man, six pie or two annas for a woman and one anna for a child; carpenters and tailors are usually paid at the rate 4\u00bd annas per day, headmasons 5\u00bd annas and masons and blacksmiths over four annas. Water carriers and diggers obtain 2\u00bd annas and personal servants three annas, while a pair of bullocks with a coolie are charged for at 11 annas per day.\n\nBefore Captain Erskine's settlement in 1850 the coinage of the district consisted of various rupees emanating from native mints which were accepted into the treasury according to their value compared with Company rupees. These coins were known as Balashahi, Srinagari, Nautshahi, Rajashahi, Gajashahi or Chanderi rupees, and are still occasionally given away at the time of marriages and other ceremonies. They however have long ceased to have currency in the district, and at the present day none but King's coin is in use. The weights and measures in common use are those in use elsewhere, though the old ser of 100 tolas in Jalaun, 102 in Kunch and 92 in Kalpi is sometimes used. For measuring grain the pata is sometimes employed. This holds from five to eight ser; smaller measures are the chura, holding one ser, the adharo, half a ser, the patoli, a quarter ser, and the chohri an eighth of a ser. The standard bigha now in use is 2,217 square yards, but the bigha used at Major Ternan's settlement in 1863 was 2,256 25 square yards. The subdivisions of the bigha are biswas and biswansi; two bighas two biswas and 18 biswansi make one British acre. Cloth is usually sold by a yard of 16 girahs, but in Kalpi the yard employed frequently comprises 18 girahs; and local weavers sell cloth by the cubit, which is equivalent to nearly 9 girahs.\nLoan transactions between agriculturists or others and *maha-jans* or *bunias* are effected in various ways. When an advance of grain for seed is made, it is most commonly repaid at harvest time with the addition of one-fourth of the weight of grain advanced, the rate of accommodation being known as *sawai*. To guard against losses from fluctuations of prices at sowing time and harvest the lender makes a deduction from the grain advanced usually at the rate of one *ser* in the rupee or more, while the borrower makes a corresponding addition to the grain repaid. If money is advanced for the purchase of grain seed, repayment is made in grain at harvest at a stipulated rate favourable to the lender. In both these cases the security is the agriculturists' crop, in which the *mahajan* acquires a part interest. In the tracts where there is much grazing, advances of money are made for the purchase of milch-kine, repayable in so much *ghi* per month; and when plough-cattle are required, loans are commonly made on the deposit of silver ornaments of a value in excess of the weight of rupees advanced. If repayment is not made within the period stipulated the deposit is generally forfeited, the rate of interest being Rs. 2 or Rs. 2\u00bd per mensem. Loans for larger sums, such as are involved in lavish marriage festivities or payment of the government revenue, have been somewhat curtailed since the passing of the Land Alienation Act of 1903. In such cases a slightly higher rate of interest is charged, for example 3 per cent. per mensem instead of 2 per cent. One method by which payment is sometimes secured is by an agreement with the borrowing proprietor that the lender shall collect the rents of some or all of his tenants. The proprietor in such cases gives receipts in full to the tenants and they pay the *mahajan*, on whom they are themselves generally dependent for advances of seed.\n\nA movement in favour of an agricultural bank on a co-operative basis was initiated in July 1907; in that year the Jalaun District Co-operative Bank was started at Orai with a branch at Kalpi. The authorized share capital is fixed at Rs. 50,000, divided into 6,000 shares of Rs. 10 each, 500 of which have been allotted to the Kalpi branch. The working of the bank is in the hands of a board of directors consisting of 17 members, who hold meetings weekly in the sowing season and fortnightly at other times. Current, fixed and savings banks deposits are received, and loans\nare given at a rate of \\(12\\frac{1}{2}\\) or \\(13\\frac{1}{2}\\) per cent., all classes of public servants, traders, artisans, zamindars and cultivators having dealings with the bank. Current deposits carry no interest, but fixed deposits for one year are paid 6 per cent. and for five years, 7 per cent.; savings banks deposits under Rs. 100 carry 5 per cent. and large sums in even hundreds 7 per cent.; deposits in the savings bank are limited to Rs. 500. For the year ending June 1908, the bank after payment of interest declared a dividend of 10 per cent., the assets aggregating Rs. 72,765 and the liabilities Rs. 71,275, leaving a net profit of Rs. 1,490. Two rural banks at Jagnewa and Nagri in tahsil Jalaun were registered in 1908 in connection with the headquarters bank.\n\nWhen the old parganas Kunch and Kalpi came first into trade, the possession of the British, their headquarters were and for many years remained important centres of trade. As late as 1840 Kunch is said to have been an emporium so flourishing as to be celebrated throughout Bundelkhand, and to have possessed 52 banking houses. In spite of bad means of communication, which are said to have precluded traffic for nearly four months in the year, an extensive trade in salt, sugar, gur and ghi, as well as food grains of every description, was carried on with Samthar, Datia and Gwalior. Kalpi was the largest mart in Northern India, its staple commodities being cotton and al, which were exported largely by river to Mirzapur, Patna and other places, and ghi and gram which poured by this route into the Doab. The purchases of cotton by the Government amounted at one period to forty lakhs a year and by private individuals to 18 lakhs; but after 1830 the former were discontinued, and the latter dwindled down to an annual expenditure of barely seven lakhs. As regards ghi, Mr. Muir wrote in 1840: \"The vast tracts of fallow land upon which grass is produced in the rains with amazing luxuriance supply the food of numerous flocks and herds: and the scanty population, unequal to the consumption of their produce, export it in the form of ghi, which finds a ready market at Lucknow.\" The decadence, however, that had set in about 1840 rapidly advanced. The trade of the district was exhaustively investigated by Mr. White in 1879 and the following years. There were then only four shops in Kunch at which hundis could be obtained: the\ntransactions of Kalpi itself in cotton did not exceed two lakhs of rupees per annum, and the lucrative ghi trade had gone, only 1,100 maunds being annually exported to Cawnpore. The chief imports at that time into Kalpi were rice from Patna and Pilibhit, arhar from Cawnpore, sugar and gun from Mirzapur, Bonares and elsewhere, salt from Agra and tobacco from Bengal. The piece-goods of English manufacture had also begun to make their appearance in considerable quantities. From the south and native states beyond came ghi, binaula, spices, al, oilseeds, cotton country cloths and iron ore, which were exported together with fluctuating amounts of wheat and gram to Mirzapur, Patna and Cawnpore. The total value of the exports was estimated at nearly twelve lakhs, and that of imports at half that sum. The trade of Jalaun and Orai was almost entirely in agricultural produce, while Kotra Saiyidnagar is said to have turned out cloth to the annual value of one and a quarter lakhs of rupees.\n\nVarious reasons may be assigned for the decay. Kunch was ruined by the disappearance of the Jalaun state, the opening up of other lines of communication with Jhansi which it till then supplied, the disorders of 1857 and the formation of the customs line in 1861. The latter entered the district from Etawah near Jagamanpur, ran south close to Jalaun, thence to Kunch, and left the district south of Ingoi on the Jhansi-Cawnpore road. It consisted of an impassable hedge with 70 crossing places about half a mile distant from each other on a fairweather road 45 miles long and 30 feet broad. This damaged the trade with the native states on the west, and the establishment of an assistant patrol's post at Ingoi in 1866 is said to have almost put an end to the trade in salt, sugar and molasses. Next came the construction of the Saugor-Jhansi-Cawnpore metalled road, and the opening of the railway from Cawnpore to Etawah; the latter tapped the trade via Shergarh ghat and Auraiya, and later Gwalior itself was linked up by rail with Agra, the railway together with the road via Bhind to Etawah supplying most of the needs of the country beyond the Pahuj, which had once looked to Kunch for its imports. Finally the building of the Indian Midland Railway from Itarsi to Cawnpore in 1889 and the bridging of the Jumna at Kalpi absorbed all the produce available for export in the district, and\nthe rise to pre-eminence of Cawnpore removed the main cotton mart from Kalpi. At the present day the bulk of the trade of the district is rail-borne. During the years from 1903 to 1907, inclusive, the average exports from the three stations of Kalpi, Orai and Ait have amounted to 776,960 maunds; out of this 580,702 maunds were entrained at Kalpi, 125,285 maunds at Ait and 70,974 maunds at Orai. The main articles of export are oilseeds, to the extent of 160,122 maunds, raw cotton to that of 5,442 maunds, both of which are booked to Bombay, and gram and pulses to the amount of 77,970 maunds, much of which finds its way to other stations on the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, or to other districts of the United Provinces via Cawnpore or Agra.\n\nDuring the same period the imports by rail at the same stations have averaged 402,028 maunds. These consist for the most part of refined and unrefined sugar, averaging 68,807 maunds, arriving from the northern districts in Oudh and Rohilkhand via Cawnpore, wheat to the extent of 28,235 maunds from the same source, and salt which comes from the Rajputana-Malwa Railway via Agra to an average annual extent of 21,142 maunds. The remainder of the export and import trade is made up of miscellaneous articles among which ghi, kharif grains and wood may be mentioned as exports and cotton piecegoods, rice and kerosine oil as imports. No statistics of the road-borne traffic are available, but a considerable trade is carried on between Kunch and Gwalior in the same articles, and between the district and Etawah or Cawnpore via Shergarh and Kalpi ghats. In this latter direction a considerable number of animals pass northwards yearly destined for the markets at Cawnpore and other places. The chief cattle market of the district\u2014and indeed of this portion of Bundelkhand\u2014is Kunch, where, as a precaution against theft, a register of cattle sales is kept. Besides this a considerable trade is carried on at Kunch in salted beef, which is exported to Rangoon. During recent years the town of Kotra has been the centre of traffic in ghi, which is brought here from the wild tracts along the Betwa and finds its way to the railway at Ait.\n\nThe one industry for which the district was famous was the preparation and dyeing of cloths. It lingers still, but is greatly in decay. The centre of it lay in the two towns, situated close to one\nanother near the Betwa in tahsil Orai, called Kotra and Saiyidnagar. The latter was celebrated for *zumardi*, which was made from *aikri* or coarse country cloth. A piece of *aikri* measuring six feet wide by 6\u00bd yards long was first bleached and then for eight days rubbed in a mixture of castor oil and *rassi*, or saline earth. It was next washed with soap and dipped in a solution formed of the powder of an astringent nut called *hara*. When dry it was stamped according to certain favourite patterns with a mixture composed of *geru* (a kind of red ochre), gum, alum and water and rewashed. Next it was boiled in a cauldron containing a composition of powdered *al* dye, 2\u00bd parts, and *ahawai* flower, one part, for six hours and once again lightly washed. When the boiling was complete stamping was again carried out with a mixture of 1\u00bd *ser* of gum to one of shell lime; it was next dried, then again washed, to be subsequently plastered over with a solution formed of 10 *sers* of *nouti* (a wood obtained from Jaipur ravines), 2\u00bd *sers* of pomegranate bark and 2\u00bd *sers* of alum. The final stamping of the pattern was made with *geru* and gum in equal parts formed into a paste. The cloth was lastly twice immersed in a solution of indigo and, when dry, was washed and starched with gum. In this final form it was exported in large quantities to Pilibhit, Hathras, Kosi, Bareilly and even to Nepal. Fifty pieces of *aikri* cloth so treated were estimated to cost in all some Rs. 84 and to sell for Rs. 90. The neighbouring town of Kotra had a local celebrity for coloured chintz called *chunari* cloth, usually worn by women. The best quality was made from *pratal*, the second from *markin*, both being dyed with turmeric and *al* and ornamented with curious designs. The latter were picked out with the hand by women before one or both colourings had been given and tightly tied with thread, neither dyeing touching the parts thus raised and tied. The trade of Kotra in *chunari* amounted in 1870 to Rs. 10,000 per annum and the cloth was exported to Agra, Rath and Jhansi, and was also disposed of in the interior of the district. At the present day red *khara* cloth like that of Jhansi is manufactured; and the dyeing of country cloth is carried on in the style generally known as *amoura*, a word which expresses a series of shades representing the various colours assumed by the mango fruit during the different stages of its\ndevelopment. These are three in number, called sunhara amaua, anari amaua and shutri amaua. Besides the dyeing industry a few silk fabrics are made in the shape of sari borders, in which silk and cotton are cunningly blended and gulbadans of various shades of red.\n\nThe only commercial enterprises with a vigorous growth are now run on European lines and connected with the cotton trade. The district contains four ginning factories, two of which are located at Kalpi and have existed for a considerable time. In 1901 a large mill was established by the firm of Messrs. Baij Nath Juggi Lal of Cawnpore at Ait, in tahsil Orai. The plant, which cost 1\u00bd lakh of rupees, has so far owing to bad seasons hardly more than paid its way. In the busy season the output averages some 500 maunds daily. The last town to be provided with a similar factory was Kunch, and the cotton-trade is, in spite of past failures, becoming once more a staple industry of the district.\n\nBesides Kunch and Kalpi the principal market towns are Jalaun, Madhogarh, Kotra and Rampura. A list of all the local bazars will be found in the appendix. Since the introduction of the railway and improvements in the means of communication many of the small markets have been discontinued, and the wants of the surrounding villages are more easily supplied from large local centres. Every village in each tahsil is within easy reach of some market where ordinary articles of consumption can be purchased and agricultural produce disposed of; besides those already mentioned that at Amkhera in tahsil Jalaun still retains a little trade.\n\nA complete list of all the fairs held in the district will be found in the appendix. They are numerous, but only a few are of any size; more are small local gatherings of a few hundred people on the occasion of some Hindu festival. A few deserve more particular mention, either on account of a local celebrity or from the fact that some trade is carried on at them. The largest religious fairs are the Ram Lila at Kunch town and the Barahs in December at the village of Basob in that tahsil. Kanjaura, in the Jagamanpur jajir is locally famous as being the spot where four streams\u2014the Chambal, Kuwari, Sindh and Pahuj\u2014unite with the Jamna. To commemorate this on Kartik Sudi Puranmashi, or at the beginning of November, a large fair called Pachnada is held.\nfrom Etawah and Gwalior visit it, and formerly it lasted 10 days with a maximum attendance of 12,000 people; but it now seldom extends beyond two days and has not a larger gathering than 2,500 persons. A somewhat larger fair is held in December at Nainoli in the Rampura jagir, lasting nearly a month and being attended now by 3,500 people. The fair is known as the Barahiyon ka mela or the Debi ji barahi and offerings are made at the shrine which are appropriated by the Raja. Numerous visitors and dealers of all kinds frequent this fair. Gopalpur, the seat of the jagir of the same name, is remarkable for a masonry well which is said to be unfathomable. Its water during the day remains only two or three feet from the platform of the well and at nightfall quite overflows it. It is stated to be 200 years old and to owe its wonderful character to the blessing of a good fagir named Mast Ram Baba. A small annual fair is held in honour of this well. The last fair that deserves mention is that at Itaura Akbarpur in tahsil Kalpi, which is celebrated on the same dates as that at Kanjaua. It lasts for some fifteen days and is held in honour of Guru Rupan, who was a famous fagir living in the time of Akbar. That monarch, in estimation of his character, built an imposing temple and tank to his memory, and many miraculous tales are told of the fagir. Shopkeepers and traders from all parts of Jalaun and from the districts of Hamirpur and Cawnpore frequent the fair, which has an estimated attendance of some 4,500 persons. Owing to the paucity of Muhammadans in the district the Muharram festivals at Orai, Kalpi, Kunch and Kotra are sparsely attended.\n\nThe district which was once very backward in good means of communication is now fairly well supplied in this respect. The railway runs across tahsils Orai and Kalpi and the roads along the main lines of traffic are metalled. The cross country roads when they run over black cotton soil are impassable in the rains and generally rough, but in the lighter tracts of Jalaun and Kalpi afford ready and fair means of communication. Along the banks of the rivers and in the more uneven tracts in the north of the district nala are numerous and offer considerable obstacles to traffic, especially during the rains. From Orai itself roads radiate in all directions, the district having been provided with a large number of them during the successive famines that have visited it, and\nespecially in that of 1897. But it is only within the last 30 years that Jalaun may be said to have been opened out in comparison with other districts and it was these calamities more than anything else that gave the impetus to rail and road construction.\n\nThe Indian Midland section of the Great Indian Peninsula Railways, Railway was built between 1882 and 1889 and opened in the latter year. Constructed originally as an insurance against famine it established a direct route between Bombay and Cawnpore and has been of inestimable value to the district. The alignment follows closely the metalled road from Jhansi to Cawnpore, and has a total length of 45 miles within the district. It has seven stations, namely at Pirona, Ait, Bhuwa, Orai, Ata, Usargaon and Kalpi. Besides this a branch line of rail, opened in 1905, has been constructed between Ait and Kunch as a feeder. The latter has a total length of nine miles without any intermediate station. Out agencies are maintained at Jalaun, Madhogarh and Kotra, whence goods are transported by carts to the nearest station.\n\nA list of all the roads in the district will be found in the appendix. In 1907 there were 669 miles of road: of these 130 miles were metalled, representing an addition of 72 miles in the last 50 years. The roads are divided into provincial and local, the former being in charge of the public works department and maintained from provincial revenues, while the latter are managed by the district board, the cost being debited to local funds. The only provincial roads are the Cawnpore-Jhansi-Saugor trunk road, 44 miles long within the district, and the two small approach roads at Bhuwa and Pirona stations. The local roads are divided into six classes. Those of the first-class which are metalled, bridged and drained throughout are six miles in length, and are maintained by the public works department for the district board. They include the two important roads connecting Kunch with Orai and Ait, and that which runs from Orai to Shergarh ferry past Jalann and Hadrukh, as well as the Jalaun-Madhogarh road. Second-class roads are all unmetalled, and are either bridged and drained throughout or only partially bridged and drained. The former have a total length of $58\\frac{1}{2}$ miles, and include the road from Gwalior to Jalaun, so far as it is not metalled, that from Kalpi to Hamirpur and that from Hamirpur to Orai. The latter,\nwhich are of less importance, are 51 miles in length and run from Kalpi towards Rath, from Jalaun to Ata and from Kunch to Bangra. Fourth-class roads are partially bridged and drained and only banked without being surfaced, and have a total length of 75 miles, 52 of which are occupied by the long road across the district from Jagamanpur to Saiyidnagar. Fifth-class roads cleared and partially bridged and drained cover 119 miles, and include the once important route from Kunch to Maughat on the Pahuj; while sixth-class roads which are only cleared run in all directions, connecting other lines of communication or important villages; they have a total length of 235\u00bd miles.\n\nThere is a dak bungalow at Orai, with accommodation for travellers, and three inspection-houses on the provincial road from Cawnpore to Jhansi, at Kalpi, Ata and Somai. Besides these there are district board bungalows at Ait, Jalaun, Kuthaund and Madhogarh. Along the two branches of the canal and their distributaries there are no less than 20 inspection-houses erected for the convenience of officers on tour. These lie at Tikaria, Timron, Orai, Ait and Hardoi in tahsil Orai; at Dabkai, Bhagwantpur, Bangra and Kunch in tahsil Kunch; at Tihar, Bahadurpur, Kuthaund, Gohan, Hadrukh and Khanwan, in tahsil Jalaun; and at Babai, Aunta, Imalia Babina and Tagaripur in tahsil Kalpi.\n\nIn the appendix will be found a list of all the ferries in the district, both public and private. The only ones of importance are those leading over the Jumna. They are 25 in number, including the pontoon bridge which replaces the ferry in the cold and hot weather on the provincial road to Cawnpore, and one private ferry. Three of them are managed from Etawah and one is managed from Cawnpore. The pontoon bridge and ferry at Kalpi is managed by the public works department and brings in a considerable income, averaging over Rs. 6,500 annually. The only private ferry recorded is that over the Pahuj, at the village of Megni in tahsil Jalaun, and is an unimportant one. There are now only three ferries belonging to the district on the Betwa. They are maintained at Kotra, Saiyidnagar and Mohana, that at Parasam on the road from Kalpi to Rath being managed by the Hamirpur authorities. On the Pahuj there is a single ferry at the village of Salaiya on the old road from Kunch to Duboh. All these ferries\nare controlled by the district board. Of those managed by other districts that at Shergarh ghat, where a bridge-of-boats is maintained when the stream of the Jumna sufficiently abates to admit of it, is far the most important, a considerable volume of trade passing up the road from Jalaun to Auraiya and thence to the station on the East Indian Railway at Phaphund.\n\nThe only permanent bridge in the district is that over the Jumna at Kalpi. It comprises 10 spans each 250 feet in length, the total length covered by the bridge being 2,626 feet. The bridge was erected during 1886 and 1887 at a total cost of Rs. 25,66,637, including Rs. 1,59,564 spent in protective works, and was opened to traffic in February 1888. The abutments and piers are built for a double line, but the girders are constructed for a single line only; there is a roadway on the same level which has been brought into use since May 1st 1895.\nCHAPTER III.\n\nThe People.\n\nThe first enumeration that applied to any portion of the district was that of 1853. This was far more accurate and scientific than its predecessors in the province, but only affected parganas Kalpi and Kunch as then constituted, which at the time were included in the Hamirpur district. Kalpi had then an ascertained area of 176 and Kunch of 153 square miles, with total populations of 54,483 and 54,271 persons, respectively, giving densities of 309 and 353 persons to the square mile. It may be noted that these were far the most thickly populated portions of western Bundelkhand at the time.\n\nBy the time the next census was taken in 1865 the district, after considerable reshuffling, had attained approximately its present formation. There were five parganas, namely, Jalaun, Ata, which included Kalpi, Orai, Kunch and Madhogarh, with a combined area of 1,546.43 square miles and a total population of 405,604 persons, of whom 184,073 were females. The district was divided into 960 mauzas or townships and the density of population was 262 per square mile. If the enumeration of 1853 was correct Kunch and Kalpi had lost a considerable number of inhabitants, as Madhogarh was the most thickly peopled pargana with 335 souls to the square mile and Kunch had not more than 288, while in the case of Kalpi comparison is vitiated by the readjustment of the boundaries.\n\nThe next enumeration was that of 1872, which was certainly more detailed and accurate than any of the preceding. The district, which still retained its old form with the exception of some minor alterations, had then an area of 1,553 square miles and a population of 404,384 persons, the resulting density being 260 per square mile. The decrease in the seven years that had elapsed since the former census was very small, and the population may be said to have remained stationary. The total number of villages returned was 840, only one of which contained from 15,000\nto 20,000 inhabitants, and only two others over 10,000; while of\nthe whole number 344 had less than 200 and 263 between two\nand five hundred. Kunch was then the most thickly populated\npargana with 320 persons to the square mile, though closely fol-\nlowed by Madhogarh with 316, and seems to have obtained a\nmarked increase.\n\nAt the following census in 1881 the three chiefships\nof Rampura, Jagamanpur and Gopalpura were excluded from\ncomputation; this reduced the area of the district to 1,477 square\nmiles. The population in this area was found to be 418,142\npersons, and the average density 283 per square mile, representing\nan increase of 3.38 per cent. over the figures of 1872. Every\npargana had gained except Kalpi, where the loss amounted to\nover 12 per cent. This is probably to be ascribed to the famine\nof 1877-78; but the fact that the district as a whole had improved\nshows how the measures of relief undertaken in that year had\nprevented death and emigration. The number of towns and\nvillages was returned as 857, but the district no longer had any\ntown with over 15,000 inhabitants, the population of Kalpi having\nfallen from 15,570 to 14,306; 336 villages contained less than 200\ninhabitants, and 275 more between two and five hundred.\n\nBefore the census of 1891 was taken the pargana of Madho-\ngarh had been abolished, and its component villages redistributed\nover Kunch and Jalaun, leaving the district with four parganas\ncontiguous with tahsils of the same name. The total population\nwas returned at 396,361 persons, a decrease of over 5 per cent.\non the numbers of 1881. Every tahsil had lost except Kunch,\nwhich recorded a rise of less than 1 per cent., the decline in\nJalaun amounting to over 8 per cent. The recorded density\nwas 268 per square mile. The decrease must be ascribed to the\nevil effects of agricultural depression resulting from bad seasons\naggravated by overassessment. Jalaun was the only district\nin the Allahabad division that showed a loss of population. The\ntotal number of towns and villages returned was 861 but now only\ntwo of these had over 10,000 inhabitants, and Kalpi showed a\nfurther large loss, falling to the second place behind Kunch.\n\nThe last census was taken in 1901, and it was then ascertained\nthat there had been a slight increase on the figures of 1891. The\ntotal number of inhabitants was 399,620, giving an average density of 271 to the square mile. Jalaun had gained almost as largely as it had lost in the previous decade, and recorded an increase of 8\u00b728 per cent. Kunch rose by 1\u00b769 per cent., but Orai lost 14\u00b762 and Kalpi 4\u00b704 per cent. The best populated pargana is Jalaun with 380 persons to the square mile, followed by Kunch with 310; while Orai has 192 and Kalpi only 187. The general rise in population during the decade is remarkable in the face of the awful droughts of 1895 to 1897; the brunt of these calamities fell on the two eastern tahsils. Tahsil Orai has been the chief sufferer, and the accumulated calamities of the last twenty years starting from 1884, when depression first set in, have been marked by a large decrease in population and considerable contraction of the area under the plough.\n\nIn 1865 the only places possessing over 5,000 inhabitants were Kalpi, Kunch, Jalaun and Orai; of these Kalpi had a population exceeding 15,000 and Kunch and Jalaun over 10,000. The only changes that have taken place among them since are a steady decline in Kalpi and Jalaun and a steady increase in Kunch and Orai. In 1901 the population of Kunch exceeded 15,000 and that of Kalpi had fallen to a little over 10,000. At the same period there were 15 villages with between two and five thousand, but out of the whole number of 843 in the district no less than 619 had less than 500 inhabitants, while 139 more had between five hundred and a thousand. Among tahsils Jalaun has far the largest number of inhabited sites, comprising nearly half the total in the whole district. The reason for this is that the soils of this tahsil are predominantly light and both require and encourage the greater dispersion of the people in small settlements for the better cultivation of the land. Nothing strikes an observer from the Doab so much as the long distances that separate the villages in the black-soil areas and the almost entire absence of hamlets. Here the cluster of houses lies perched on elevated sites which lift it above the level expanse and the stretches of water that accumulate in the rains. The huts themselves are noticeable, as elsewhere in Bundelkhand, for their roofs of red flat tiles, and the generally substantial nature of the houses lends an air of solidity and strength to the settlement, which is\nfrequently increased by the presence of a ruined fort close by. In the north however, near the Jumna, the roofs are frequently of mud and flat. Internally the structure of the houses does not differ from that found in the Doab, and consists of a courtyard surrounded by a wall along which are rooms and sheds, or of simply a mud hut provided with a sloping tiled roof. The outward appearance of the houses is generally clean and tidy. The masonry buildings which are found in the towns or which belong to more substantial landholders in the villages do not differ in outline from those possessed by those who are less well-to-do; and in most villages may be seen some solid structure of country-made bricks towering above the mud houses that stretch away on either side of it.\n\nOf the total population 49,469 or 12\u00b738 are classed as urban, and the district may be said to be almost entirely one of rural inhabitants scattered for the most part in small settlements: 53\u00b719 per cent. of the rural population live in villages containing between 500 and 2,000 inhabitants and 37\u00b702 per cent. in those which have less than 500. There are calculated to be on the average 50 houses to the square mile, each house containing 5\u00b740 persons. This is a higher proportion than is found in any other Bundelkhand district, but no other district of that tract contains so little barren land or waste. Even so, the number of houses to the mile is less than half of that found in the Doab.\n\nThe population has been from time to time considerably affected by migration, though it is difficult to gauge the extent from the statistics taken at fixed periods. At the census of 1901 86\u00b794 per cent. of the people enumerated were born in the district and 11\u00b776 per cent. in adjacent tracts, while 1\u00b730 per cent. came from other parts of India. The percentage of immigrants was thus 13\u00b71 and the greater part of these were women. This addition to the population was to a large extent counteracted by emigration, for of all those who gave Jalaun as their birthplace 9\u00b713 per cent. were found in other districts of the United Provinces, and 2\u00b725 per cent. in other parts of India. The large decrease in population in 1891 was ascribed to the dispersion of the manufacturing and trading classes of Madhogarh and Kalpi, the exodus of many Dakshini Pandit families to Gwalior, and the migration of the poorer agriculturists to districts where conditions of life\nwere less hazardous. Ten years later the small increase in the numbers shown by the census figures was attributed to the fact that many emigrants of the previous decade were attracted back to their homes by the prosperity of the years 1891 to 1893. As in other parts of Bundelkhand, there is continual movement to and fro between the inhabitants of Jalaun and those of contiguous tracts of native territory, with whom they are in many cases connected by blood or marriage.\n\nIn 1865 the proportion of females to a hundred males was no higher than 83\u00b708, but since that time there has been a steady increase. It rose in 1872 to 86\u00b77, and in 1881 to 93\u00b75; there was a further rise to 94\u00b72 in 1891, but a slight drop in 1901 to 93\u00b78. The proportion is the lowest in the Bundelkhand tract, where it has generally been high: but it corresponds very closely with the provincial average of 93\u00b77. The discrepancy, however, with the neighbouring district of Hamirpur, where the proportion is 99\u00b72, is striking, and it is possible that the low proportion of females to males in Jalaun is to be ascribed in part to the practice of female infanticide, which was without doubt once extensively practised.\n\nOf the total population at last census 374,298, or 93\u00b764 per cent., were Hindus; 25,944, or 6\u00b727 per cent., Musalmans; 136 Aryas, 133 Jains, 94 Christians, 15 Sikhs and 6 Parsis. The proportion of Hindus slightly exceeds the average for Bundelkhand and has remained constant, while it is largely in excess of the provincial average. On the other hand the number of Musalmans is considerably in excess of the average for Bundelkhand and shows a tendency to increase, though the proportion has dropped from 6\u00b743 in 1891; in 1881 it was 6\u00b714. It is however insignificant in both number and position, and is mainly concentrated in the towns or those large villages which in former days were centres of Muhammadan rule. Here they are engaged in occupations of various types other than agriculture, and are generally not amongst the poorest of the inhabitants, while a more generous standard of comfort among them conduces to greater longevity and fertility.\n\nOf the Christian population 35 were Europeans and Eurasians and 59 were natives. Among these 46 belonged to the Anglican communion, 21 were Methodists, 11 Presbyterians, 3 Roman\nCatholics, and one a Baptist: no denomination was returned in the case of 12 persons. No missions have permanent stations in the district, but the Methodist Episcopal Church of America conducts evangelical work in the three subdivisions of Orai, Kunch and Madhogarh, into which the district is for this purpose divided. There has been an increase in the Indian Christian population; its number was only 20 in 1891: none existed in 1881 at all. There is a small church at Orai in the same building as the court of the Sessions Judge, where services are occasionally held by the chaplain of Jhansi.\n\nJalaun had in 1901 a larger number of Aryas than any other district of Bundelkhand, the total having increased elevenfold in the decade beginning in 1891. The number of adherents of the Arya Samaj comprise 29 Brahmans, 35 Banias, 25 Kayasths 10 Khattris, 23 Rajputs, 7 Bhats, 4 Gujars, 2 Kachhis, and one Kahar. But in no sense can the Aryas be considered as yet an important portion of the population. It is noticeable, however, that where Christianity has made the greatest advance as in Hamirpur and Jhansi, the numbers of the Samajists have made no headway; while in this district, which has hitherto been left practically untouched by Christian missions, the Arya creed has made marked progress. The Sikhs are in Government service, chiefly as policemen, and the Parsis have found their way to the district as merchants or the servants of traders of the same creed. The Jains, who belong almost entirely to the Bania or Vaisya caste, are scattered through the district, and for the most part engaged in trade.\n\nThe great majority of the Hindus of Jalaun belong, as is usually the case, to no particular religious sect. Of their total number 15\u00b74 per cent. were returned as Vaishnavites of various kinds, 5\u00b76 per cent. as Saivites, 4\u00b77 per cent. as monotheists, and less than 1 per cent. as worshippers of the Panchon Pir: the rest with the exception of 297 Radhaswanis were accredited to no particular form of Hinduism. The vast majority of the Saivites were returned as Lingaits; the only other sect represented by three figures being Pasupats, while of the various Vaishnavite sects the strongest are Ramanandis with over 50,000 representatives, Kabirpanthis with nearly 1,200 and Vallabhacharyas with a little over 1,000.\nGenerally the older forms of worship are observed unchanged in rural tracts, the members of the new sects being mainly residents of towns. In religion as in other respects the inhabitant of the district is little addicted to change; nor are the signs of religious life in the shape of temples particularly numerous or evident. Every village has its small shrine, presided over by the local Brahman priest; and the most favourite deities are Mahadeo in his phallic form, and the monkey god, Hanuman. In the more remote villages and among the more ignorant and low-caste portion of the population various local godlings and spirits are worshipped, and many superstitions exist regarding the necessity of propitiating these at sowing or harvest time or when any calamity befalls.\n\nAccording to the statistics of the last census the Hindu population of the district was composed of the representatives of 74 different castes, while in the case of 249 persons no caste was specified. Only a few of these castes are of any great importance. There is only one caste with over 50,000 members, though one other nearly approaches that figure, the two combined accounting for 31\u00b737 per cent. of the Hindu inhabitants: two others occur in numbers exceeding 20,000, making up 16\u00b769 per cent., and seven more are represented by over 10,000 souls, who form an additional 27\u00b705 per cent. The remaining 24\u00b789 per cent. comprises persons belonging to a great variety of castes, of which some deserve special mention as being either peculiar to this or contiguous districts or as occurring in unusually large numbers, while the rest are common to most parts of the United Provinces and call for no remark.\n\nFirst in point of numbers come Chamars, of whom, including 53 Lona Chamars, there are 67,700 representatives or 18\u00b709 per cent. of the Hindu population. They are well distributed and form the most numerous caste in every subdivision, and their proportion rises as high as 19\u00b79 per cent. in Jalaun. They are employed for the most part in general and agricultural labour, and though they own no land as proprietors they cultivate considerable areas as tenants, paying high rents and devoting themselves to their work with considerable zeal.\n\nIn the second place come Brahmans, who, together with Marathas and Pandas, number 49,697 or 13\u00b725 per cent. of the total\nnumber of Hindus. They are found in large numbers in all tahsils, but are considerably more numerous in Jalaun and Kunch than in Kalpi and Orai: in the first of these they form 15\u00b72 per cent. of the population, and in the latter 14\u00b73 per cent. The majority belong to the Kanaujiya division, but here as in other districts of Bundelkhand Jijhotiyas abound and Sanadhs form about a third of the whole number, while other subdivisions are very scantily represented. Both as landlords and tenants the Brahman inhabitants are an important portion of the population, their chief strongholds as landlords being the northern portion of the Jalaun and the whole of Kalpi tahsil.\n\nRajputs.\n\nThe third place is taken by Rajputs, who number 35,433 or 9\u00b747 per cent. of the Hindus. They exceed Brahmans and come near to being the most numerous caste of all in Kalpi, where they form 15 per cent. of the total number of Hindus, and in the contiguous tract of Jalann they form as much as 11\u00b73 per cent.; in Orai and Kunch, the southern parganas, their numbers are relatively unimportant, their place being taken by Brahmans and the better agricultural castes, such as Kachhis and Kurmis. The Rajput inhabitants of the district belong to a large variety of clans, three of which, namely, Sengars, Chauhans and Kachhwahas\u2014greatly exceed all others and have over 5,000 representatives each. Five other clans have over 1,000 members, but the remainder have comparatively few and in some cases insignificant numbers.\n\nSengars.\n\nThe most numerous clan is that of Sengars, which has 7,958 representatives. Of this number no less than 6,631 are living in tahsil Jalaun. Of the actual history of the tribe little is known. They themselves ascribe their origin to Lanka or Ceylon, and say they got their name from one Singhi, a celebrated holy man. They are recognised as one of the thirty-six royal clans. The Raja of Jagamanpur is the only Sengar Rajput chief existing and is head of the tribe. The community of Sengars in this district, the contiguous portions of Gwalior and the neighbouring tract of Etawah beyond the Jumna is a large one, and they claim to have been settled here since the days of the Hindu kingdom of Kanauj, when a Sengar chieftain, named Bisukh Deo, obtained a large jagir as dowry on his marriage with the daughter of a Rahtor king. Sengars are considered practically the equals of Kachhwahas and\nintermarry with them. They are naturally warlike and turbulent, and took advantage of the disorder during the Mutiny to plunder Jalaun and the adjoining districts, while many families among them were till recent years subject to the provisions of the Female Infanticide Prevention Act.\n\nNext to Sengars come Chauhans with 5,719 representatives; of this number 3,859 are found in Kalpi, 923 in Jalaun and 764 in Kunch. How or when they came into the district is not known; but they were probably settlers after the break-up of the Chandel power in 1182 A.D., and may have been purposely settled here by the Chauhan king of Delhi in order to keep his newly-conquered possessions in subjection.\n\nChauhans are followed by Kachhwahas, who number 5,164 persons. Over four-fifths of the whole are found in tahsils Kunch and Jalaun, the two westerly subdivisions, and the same clan extends over a large portion of Gwalior territory beyond the district border. In this direction the country in early times was known as Kachhwahagarh, and their old fort still exists. Tradition relates that Raja Dulha Rai of Narwar had two sons, Kakul Rao, who founded the ruling family of Jaipur, and Baikal Rao, who remained at Narwar. The latter's descendant, Bhuwan Pal, established himself at Lahar, now in Gwalior state, and from him are descended the present Rajas of Rampura and Gopalpura. Another tradition says that the clan migrated from Kosula; and while one branch founded Rohtas on the Son river the other established a colony at Lahar, and in course of time spread thence to Narwar, the celebrated fort which they built and held till 1129 A.D. In the 9th century a branch emigrated and founded Ambar. At any rate from very early times Kachhwahas have held the whole of this portion of the country. In 1619 Raja Jaswant Singh obtained a jagir worth two lakhs of rupees from the Delhi emperor and the grant continued to be held by his family till its resumption by Sindhia, who took all but twenty-eight villages. The Kachhwahas are a warlike race and supplied many good soldiers to the old Bengal infantry.\n\nNearly all the Sikarwars, amounting to 2,110, and Rahtors, totalling 1,356, are found in tahsil Jalaun, where they have probably established themselves by inter-marriage with the predominant Rajput clans. Parihars are found to the number of 1,673, half\nof whom are in tahsil Orai, where they are the most important Rajput tribe. The Parihars of at least one village, namely Gurha, are related to the Dhasan side Parihars of Hamirpur and Jhansi, who pride themselves on their pure lineage. They claim descent from Raja Nahar Rao, who is said to have come from Mount Abu and settled in Jigui. In 1246 A.D. a descendant of his built the fort of Ramgarh in the ravines between Majhgawan and the river in Rath, and extended his sway over the surrounding villages. Two branches of the family living at Majhgawan and Milehta in Hamirpur have obtained fairly extensive landed possessions in that district. The Gaurs with 1,308 representatives and the Chamar Gaurs with 23 are probably late immigrants. They are chiefly found in Kalpi and Jalaun, while the Bais, who number in all 1,017, reside for the most part in Kunch, where they probably settled after the 13th century. The next clan is that of the Bhadaurias numbering 805, found for the most part in Jalaun, in close proximity to their kinsmen the Chauhans; then come Chandels, 679, in Jalaun and Kalpi, Panwars, 654, chiefly in Kalpi, and Jadubansi, 561, also mainly in that tahsil. The only other clan that calls for mention is the Bundela, which is one of the poorest represented in the district and has only 200 resident members, settled mostly in Kunch.\n\nKachhis are the fourth most numerous caste, number 27,016 souls and form 7\u00b722 per cent. of the Hindu population. Both in Kunch and Jalaun they form 8 per cent., in Orai 6\u00b73 per cent, and only 4\u00b73 per cent. in Kalpi. They belong almost entirely to the subdivision called Kachhwaha Kachhis, who declare they are descendants of the union of Kachwaha Rajputs of Narwar with women of inferior caste. Their traditions point to Narwar as their home, and the fact that they are found in largest numbers in the same localities where Kachhwaha Rajputs predominate suggests that their claims are not wholly groundless. Possibly the Rajputs brought them with themselves when they spread over this tract of country. In Jalaun as elsewhere they are among the best of cultivators and by no means confine themselves to market-gardening.\n\nKoris with their kinsmen, Parsutiyas and Kushtas, have 19,596 representatives, amounting to 5\u00b724 per cent. of the Hindu\ninhabitants. They are well distributed through all tahsils, but are somewhat more numerous in Orai than elsewhere. In the neighbourhood of Kotra they still abound and are devoted to their traditional occupation, but elsewhere they engage but little in the manufacture of cloth and seek their living by agriculture and general labour.\n\nNext to Koris come Ahirs, whose 18,526 representatives are as usual well distributed throughout all tahsils and constitute 4\u00b795 per cent. of the Hindus. They are, however, to be found in greatest strength in Orai and Kalpi, where the deep ravines fringing the Jumna and Betwa furnish them with the grazing-ground needed for the pasture of their cattle. This caste claims Muttra as the cradle of its race and declares that in the time of Krishna they were the village Banias of Brindaban, and that those who had over 1,000 head of cattle were known as Nandbans and that those with less were called Gwalabans. The Nandbans Ahirs outnumber all other subdivisions in this district. Gwalabans are comparatively few, and the other best represented subcastes are Dhindhors and Ghosis. Akin to them are the Gadariyas or shepherds: they number 14,504 souls, or 3\u00b787 per cent. of the Hindu population, and are most numerous in Kalpi, Jalaun and Kunch.\n\nBanias, who number 13,243 and form 3\u00b754 per cent. of the Hindus, are ubiquitous. Of this total 7,632 belong to the Gahoi subdivision, exceeding the number found in any other district of the province. With them 69 Mahajans and 11 Marwaris may be mentioned. More important to the district are the Kurmis and Lodhis, the former of whom have 12,930 and the latter 11,663 representatives, constituting 3\u00b745 and 3\u00b712 per cent., respectively, of the Hindu inhabitants. Kunch has always been the stronghold of the Kurmi population of the district, where this caste forms 7\u00b73 per cent. of the Hindu population of the tahsil; but Lodhis are most numerous in Orai, where their percentage rises to 9\u00b74. The Kurmis do not belong to any of the subdivisions specified at the census nor is their origin known. It is however certain that pargana Orai was an old Lodhi place of settlement, and there are many traditions of colonies having proceeded westward from the villages of Jaisari, Kusmilia, Garha, Bandhauri Kalan, Kharka and Kuiya, 350 to 450 years ago. About one-third of the Lodhis of the district are Jariya.\nLodhis, who are found in largest numbers north of the Jumna and Ganges. Some of the same caste west of the Betwa call themselves Kurmi Lodhis, and it is possible that these two castes are not widely separated, if they are not actually connected by blood, while they are equally good as cultivators. Telis number 10,798, or 2.88 per cent. of the Hindus, and are the only other caste in the district with over 10,000 representatives: they generally restrict themselves to their professional calling and are found equally in all tahsils.\n\nThere are a few other Hindu castes which still deserve mention. The most numerous of these are Khangars with 6,354 members, found for the most part in Jalaun and Kunch. This tribe is chiefly interesting from the tradition, which is well authenticated, that it formerly held a considerable tract of country as vassal of the Delhi court after the break-up of the Chandel kingdom in 1182 A.D. There is no actual claim on the part of the Khangars to have included this district within the boundaries of their dominions, but these are said to have stretched as far as Mahoba in the east, and the headquarters of the tribe was at Garh Kurar, 17 miles north-east of Jhansi, and the fact that they are found in large numbers in this district suggests that the Khangar Raja once held Jalaun in subjection. Here as elsewhere they are now regarded as among the lowest of the population and, as in Hamirpur and Jhansi, are largely recruited as village chaukidars. Not unlike them, but perhaps even lower in the social scale and without any tradition of former greatness, are the Basors, who number 4,979. These are well distributed over all tahsils except Jalaun, but are most numerous in Kunch. They are most numerous in, though not actually confined to, the districts of Bundelkhand, and act as sweepers and in other menial occupations. They often call themselves Bansphors. The Gujars, numbering 4,871 souls, are an important portion of the population in Jalaun and Kunch, where their settlements appear to hug the rugged country along the Pahuj river.\n\nThe last census showed representatives of 38 different Musalman castes in the district, while 271 persons belonged to no specified subdivision. Only one of these castes had over 10,000 members, namely Sheikhs, who made up 43.53 per cent. of the whole. Pathans numbered 6,235, Saiyids 1,914 and Behnas 1,397, but no other caste exceeded 1,000. The Sheikhs, who belong mainly to\nthe Quroshi and Siddiqi subdivisions, and the Pathans, who are for the most part Ghoris, are equally distributed through all tahsils. Saiyids are likewise found everywhere, but Behnas are for the most part in Kunch and Orai. In connection with this caste it is interesting to note that a tradition of former Behna occupation is current with reference to the villages of Kharka, Karmer and Khadri, in tahsil Orai, as in certain villages of Hamirpur, and that the mysterious number 989, whose significance has not yet been explained, recurs in the legends of those places. Besides the main Musalman castes Qassabs, Julahas, Kunjras, Manihas, Faqirs, Nats, Rangrez and Banjaras are found, but according to the census returns of 1901 the district appears to possess only one solitary converted Rajput, and that a female.\n\nOf the total population of the district 63\u00b710 per cent. is dependent for its support on agriculture and kindred occupations. The industrial population amounts to 15\u00b728 per cent., and includes all those engaged in the provision and supply of material substances. Of this number 33\u00b776 per cent., or approximately one-third, are devoted to the manufacture or preparation of textile fabrics and dress; 30\u00b742 per cent. are accounted for under the head of food, drink and stimulants, and 10\u00b732 under that of wood and caneworkers, while 5\u00b762 are occupied in leather work. Unskilled labour, other than agricultural, made up 9\u00b791 per cent. of the whole population and personal and domestic services 5\u00b772 per cent. Next in order comes government services with 2\u00b705 per cent. Those whose means of subsistence rendered them independent of any occupations formed a proportion of 1\u00b766 per cent.; the professions absorbed 1\u00b729 per cent., while only .99 per cent. was left for commerce, transport and storage. The large preponderance of the agricultural and industrial population and the small number of professional and business men indicate clearly the backward nature of the tract.\n\nThe ordinary language of the bulk of the inhabitants is Bundelkhandi or Bundeli. In the northern portion of the district, along the banks of the Jumna, the varieties spoken are Tirhari and Bhadaori, the former being also known as Kinari ki boli or \"the boundary speech\" and the latter being the form of Bundeli spoken in Agra and Etawah. In this district, however, Tirhari differs little if at all from pure Bundeli and extends over the north, north-east and\ncentre of the district. In the south and south-east the dialect known as *Nilatha*, but mixed with *Awadhi*, prevails, and in the south-east is found a form of speech peculiar to the Lodhis. Neither of these differs greatly from standard *Bundelkhandi*. A few immigrants speak the Mewati dialect of *Rajasthani* and a few others *Marathi*, while the Musalmans in the larger centres speak a slightly corrupted Hindustani. At the present day the district has no literature of its own, though in the person of Bans Gopal, born in 1845, it produced one well-known bard at Jalaun. Kalpi, however, has the honour of being the native town of Mahesh Das Dube, born in 1528, who became the poet laureate of Akbar and was subsequently better known by the name of Birbal, the Emperor's prime minister.\n\nThe land tenures at present prevailing in the district are the same as those found throughout the province of Agra and present no peculiar features. At the recent settlement which ended in 1906 the district contained 2,355 separate estates, with an average of nearly 400 acres apiece. Of this number 498, comprising 13\u00b79 per cent. of the total area, were held in single *zamindari* and 833, or 35\u00b74 per cent., in joint *zamindari*; 276 or 11\u00b77 per cent. in perfect and 647 or 27\u00b74 percent, in imperfect *pattidari*; while 93 were *bhaiyachara*: eight mahals were owned by the Government. From this it will be seen that far the greater part of the district is in the hands of peasant proprietors, who cultivate a considerable portion of the land themselves. In fact, with the exception of the Raja of Sikri, Babu Jagdish Pershad of Babai, and the Thakurs of Magroul and Pirona, there are no large proprietors in the district. So far as any distinction can be made between the various tahsils it may be said that the largest number of *zamindari* estates lies in tahsil Jalaun, while the *bhaiyachara* tenure was found for the most part among the Rajputs of the northern portion of the district, especially tahsil Kalpi. The total number of recorded proprietors was 25,240. The 499 single proprietors, including the Government, held 14 per cent. of the entire district between them, or an average of 266 acres apiece, while in joint *zamindari* estates 5,126 proprietors divided 26 per cent. with an average of less than 48 acres each. In *pattidari* estates there were no less than 16,907 owners, whose total possessions\ncomprised 53 per cent. of the whole district, the share of each being less than 30 acres each, while the bhaiyachara co-sharers were even worse off, 2,708 of them owning only 7 per cent. of the land or less than 24 acres each. The castes among whom excessive subdivision of property is particularly prevalent are Brahmans and Rajputs, and in some cases their families were overgrown to such an extent that they had to be treated with special leniency in assessment. The cultivated area per head was considerably less, varying from 1.57 acres in single zamindari to 11 in bhaiyachara estates. These figures give an idea of the extent to which landed property is split up among numerous petty proprietors.\n\nOf the various castes Rajputs hold the largest area, amounting to 30.2 per cent. of the district; they prevail in most tahsils, but especially in Kalpi and Jalaun. The holdings of Brahmans amount to 28 per cent., but the total includes the land owned by Marwaris and other money-lenders. In every tahsil Brahmans are one of the leading landholding castes, but chiefly, like Rajputs, in Kalpi and Jalaun. Third on the list come Kurmis, who possess 11 per cent. of the district: they are the leading caste in Kunch, where they own over 24 per cent. of the tahsil, and in the pargana of Jalaun they hold over 7 per cent. The stronghold of the Gujars is like that of Kurmis in Kunch and pargana Jalaun: they own 8 per cent. of the district, but 15 per cent. of tahsil Kunch and 14 per cent. of Jalaun pargana and elsewhere are not found or are unimportant. The settlement of the Lodhis, who hold 7 per cent. of the district, lies to the east of the Kurmis, as that of the Gujars lies to the west, and this caste is spread for the most part over Orai tahsil, while elsewhere they are hardly found at all except in a few villages of the old pargana of Madhogarh. Other important landholding castes are Kayasths, 4 per cent., scattered over all tahsils; Ahirs, 3 per cent., largely in Madhogarh; Banias, 3 per cent., chiefly in Orai and Kunch; and Musalmans, 2.6 per cent., for the most part in Kalpi and Orai. Smaller areas are held by Khattris, Bairagis, Kanwaris and Gosains, and scattered shares are found even in the hands of Telis, Kewats, Bhats, Khangars and Lohars. Compared with the figures of the previous settlements Brahmans have\ngained nearly 27,000 acres, but included in this area is that which has passed to non-agricultural money-lenders and Marwaris. Banias have increased their holdings by 21,456 acres, the largest gains being in Kunch, and Kayasths and Khattris have both added to their possessions. The loss has fallen almost wholly on the agricultural castes, and Rajputs have received the severest blow with the loss of 28,766 acres: Kurmis and Gujars are poorer by 12,375 and 11,140 acres apiece, and the more thrifty Lodhis have parted with 3,490 acres.\n\nIn addition to the estates assessed to full revenue there are a number of revenue-free and ubari mahals, and of mahals or plots which pay a proportion varying from one-third to two-thirds of the assessed demand or are revenue-free. In the case of revenue-free holdings the muafidar may be either possessed of full proprietary rights or merely the assignee of the revenue fixed. The total area of revenue free land in the district is only 7,198 acres, or less than one per cent. of the total area, and the bulk of this lies in tahsil Jalaun, being largely the creation of the old ruling house. The existing favoured tenures on half, one-third, or two-thirds jama and ubari estates are the remains of old grants continued by the British Government. In early times a large number existed, but during the earlier settlements they were vigorously resumed. Ubaris, which are more common in Jhansi, signify estates held at a quit rent, which is usually a demand less than the full. The term ubari properly signifies an abatement of the full demand of land revenue to which the estate is entitled, but it is loosely and improperly applied to the reduced demand actually paid by the ubaridar. It now carries with it no other privilege than that of paying a reduced demand and is always recognised as a life grant, dependent on the good behaviour of the grantee. At the settlement of 1906 the nominal jama fixed on these estates amounted to Rs. 2,680, the realisable demand on them being Rs. 1,874.\n\nWith one exception none of the properties held by single zamindars in the district can be described as more than medium-sized. Babu Jagdish Pershad of Babai, in tahsil Kalpi, owns six villages paying Rs. 6,120 revenue; the Rajputs of Magroul with 8 villages pay Rs. 5,375, and those of Pirona, in tahsil Orai,\nwith 6 villages pay Rs. 5,015. Besides these a few money-lenders and land speculators, such as Mir Sadiq Husain and Lala Sundar Lal of Kalpi, and Musammat Sahudra Neto in Kunch have, during the period of acute depression, carved out estates of some size in their respective parganas. Actually the largest landowner is Raja Ragunath Singh of Khaksis, who owns seven whole villages and a three-quarter share in eleven others in tahsil Jalaun, paying a revenue of Rs. 9,680. The title of Raja has been held by the family for many centuries and has always been acknowledged: the present incumbent succeeded to the property on January 25th, 1896. The family is connected with the Kachhwaha Rajput house of Narwar. Eighth in descent from Raja Baikal Deo of Narwar was Raja Bhuwan Pal, who established himself at Lahar, now in the Gwalior state. Fifth in descent from Bhuwan Pal of Lahar came Ranjan Deo, who seized for himself 108 villages and formed the Khaksis estate. His descendants subsequently lost almost the whole of this at the hands of the Bundelas, but they managed to retain a small portion. At a later period their territory was invaded by the Marathas, and in 1841, when the country passed into the hands of the British, they held but eighteen villages. The property was then in the possession of Raja Gajendra Bali, who was born in 1818. He was succeeded by his brother, Raja Daulat Singh, who died in 1896, when the title and lands passed to the present titleholder, who resides at Sikri after the name of which the estate is known.\n\nOther titleholders or families who claim notice are Raja Narendra Singh of Hardoi, Raja Gobind Singh of Beona and the Maratha Pandits. The Raja of Hardoi, like the Raja of Jagamanpur, represents a branch of the Sengar clan of Rajputs. The family claims to have held a separate title from a very early date, but little is known of its history. The estates were formerly of considerable extent, but most of them were lost at the time of the Bundela invasion under Chhatarsal. When Jalaun passed into the hands of the Marathas the Peshwa gave a grant of 27 villages to Raja Gokul Singh, but the latter refused to pay the quit rent demanded and was consequently ejected by Gobind Rao, Governor of Jalaun. He subsequently obtained Hardoi and two other villages as maintenance, and these were till recently retained by\nthe family. The present holder of the title is the son of Raja Pahup Singh, who was born in 1813 and died in 1890. The property, with the exception of 300 acres held by the Raja's mother in Hardoi, tahsil Orai, has passed by foreclosure of a mortgage to a Marwari money-lender, of whom the titleholder is now a pensioner.\n\nBeona.\n\nRaja Gobind Singh of Beona resides at the place of that name in tahsil Kunch, and owns one village and five pattis paying a demand of Rs. 628. The title is said to have been conferred by the Peshwa in 1746, and has always been acknowledged by the British Government. The Raja belongs to the Bundela clan of Rajputs and is the only chieftain of that race in the district. The family is of great antiquity and the Raja actually represents the senior branch of the Bundela line. He is descended from the eldest son of Raja Malkhan, the younger line being traced through Rudr Pratap, the first Raja of Orchha. The Beona branch never acquired prominence, though it is said to have held for a time the pargana of Duboh in Gwalior. At the cession of the district to the British settlement was made with Raja Parichhat Singh, who was born in 1804 and died in 1878. His son is the present holder of the title.\n\nThe Maratha Pandits claim a passing notice. They entered the district with the Peshwa's troops about A.D. 1750, and, forming as they did a part of the governing body up to the time of the lapse of the Jalaun state in 1840, had many opportunities of acquiring wealth. The fortunes of the ruling house will be sketched in more detail in chapter V. All the Maratha Pandits without exception were strongly opposed to British rule and threw in their lot with the Nana of Bithur. Since the restoration of order in 1858 many have migrated to other Maratha countries or have sought employment under the Gwalior darbar. In 1870 they held only six villages at a revenue of Rs. 3,190, and their property has continually dwindled ever since.\n\nThe Jagirdars.\n\nIncluded in the area of the district are the hereditary feoffs of the Chiefs of Rampura, Jagamanpur and Gopalpura, the latter two of which hold considerable estates within the limits of the district itself besides their ancestral possessions.\n\nJagamanpur.\n\nRaja Rup Sah, of Jagamanpur, is a Sengar Rajput and head of that clan. He holds 31 villages in jagir, situated in the extreme\nnorth-west corner of the district, with a rental of about Rs. 75,000; and also three whole villages paying a revenue of Rs. 2,470 in Jalaun; ten whole villages and one patti paying revenue Rs. 6,272 in Etawah; and shares in four villages paying revenue Rs. 2,373 in Cawnpore. The title of Raja is said to date from the year 1100 A.D.: it was recognised by the Peshwa in 1717 and has always been recognised by the British Government. In 1787 Raja Ratan Sah obtained a confirmation of his grant from the Peshwa of Poona, and his descendants continued in possession till the cession of Jalaun in 1844, when Raja Mahipat Singh received a sanad for the estate in perpetuity on payment of an annual quit rent of Rs. 4,764. Raja Mahipat Singh died in 1854 and was succeeded by his infant son Raja Rup Sah, the present holder of the title. For some time the estate was under the management of the Court of Wards and the Raja was educated at the Wards Institution at Benares. In 1877 he was appointed an honorary magistrate within the limits of his jagir and at the same time he was given civil powers in cases up to Rs. 100, though the latter were withdrawn when Jalaun became a regulation district in 1891. The Raja's retainers are exempt from certain provisions of the Arms Act.*\n\nRaja Ram Singh of Rampura is the head of the Kachhwaha Rajputs of Jalaun, and holds a portion of the tract that still goes by the name of Kachhwahagarh. The Raja is descended in direct line from Raja Bhuwan Pal, who established himself at Lahar in Gwalior. In 1619 Raja Jaswant obtained a jagir worth two lakhs of rupees from the Delhi emperor; and the grant continued to be held by the family till its resumption by Sindhia, who took all but twenty-eight villages. At the cession of Jalaun in 1844 the tenure of this estate was confirmed by the British Government. Raja Man Singh rendered good service during the Mutiny, giving useful information to the authorities at Cawnpore. On account of this he was attacked by the mutineers from Gwalior, who took him prisoner and only released him after the payment of a large sum of money. He subsequently rendered great assistance in restoring order in the north of Jalaun. He was rewarded with a khilat of Rs. 5,000, a grant of land and a sanad confirming him\n\n* G.O. no. 1013, dated the 4th July 1879.\nin the possession of his estate. Raja Man Singh died without issue in 1873, and was succeeded by his adopted son, the present holder of the title. The Raju was for some time an honorary magistrate, but resigned the office several years ago. Like the other jagirdars he has his own police force and excise administration within the limits of his estate, which consists of 46 villages with an approximate rental of Rs. 60,000.\n\nRao Sheo Darshan Singh of Gopalpura represents a younger branch of the Kachhwaha family of Lahar. The Gopalpur estate was founded by Alam Rao, a descendant of Ram Raj, the younger son of Raja Rup Pal Singh of Lahar, who obtained a jagir of 62 villages. The property continued to be held by his descendants till the beginning of the 19th century, when it was greatly reduced by Sindha. At the cession of this portion of Jalaun in 1844 the Gopalpura jagir consisted of only 12 villages; but at the present time it comprises 9 villages held revenue-free in jagir with a rental of about Rs. 30,000; 6 villages and 4 pattis situate within the district assessed at Rs. 6,440, and 4 villages in Gwalior. The title of Rao was first assumed by Alam Rao and has been retained ever since. The present holder is the cousin and adopted son of Rao Lachman Singh, who died in 1878. In 1888 he was invested with powers of an honorary magistrate within the limits of his jagir and also with civil powers in cases of which the value does not exceed Rs. 100.\n\nOf the total holdings area at the settlement of 1906, 30\u00b778 per cent. was in the hands of proprietors themselves, while 66\u00b790 per cent. was in the possession of rent-paying tenants and 2\u00b732 per cent. was held rent-free. In this district, however, the distinction between tenants and proprietors is not very clearly drawn, and large areas of land shown as held by tenants are in reality held by co-sharers cultivating in one another's pattis. These returns do not therefore convey an adequate idea of the enormous part that the proprietors play in the agriculture of the district. Particularly is this the case in tahsils Orai and Kalpi: it prevails to a somewhat less extent in Kanch and is smallest in Jalaun, where the population is denser and the cultivation more intense. The actually cultivated area held by proprietors at the settlement\namounted to 31\u00b721 per cent. of the cultivation, compared with 32\u00b787 per cent. at the previous settlement.\n\nThe chief cultivating castes are Rajputs, Brahmans, Lodhis, Kurmis, Ahirs and Gujars, who at the recent settlement held 25\u00b783, 16\u00b794, 12\u00b728, 11\u00b792, 4\u00b763 and 4\u00b738 per cent. of the total holdings area respectively. The two first may be reckoned among the worst of cultivators; Kurmis and Lodhis are the best; Gujars and Ahirs hold an intermediate position, but do not rise as a rule beyond indifference. As already mentioned, Kurmis predominate in Kunch, where their holdings aggregate nearly 25 per cent. of the whole, but they are also an important body in Orai and hold 18\u00b740 per cent. of that tahsil. Lodhis hold no less than 40\u00b735 per cent. of the holdings area in Orai tahsil. In Kalpi and Jalaun Rajputs cultivate 46\u00b796 and 26\u00b793 per cent. respectively: they hold less than 6 per cent. in Orai, while Brahmans are found with little variation in all tahsils. Of less important castes Chamars cultivate 8\u00b706 of the area of Jalaun but hold little land elsewhere, while Kachhus have an area aggregating 4\u00b712 per cent. of Kunch. In the same tahsil the Gujars and Ahirs are for the most part found; their holdings amount to 13\u00b784 and 9\u00b756 per cent. respectively. Musalmans are distributed as cultivators over all tahsils, but hold their largest area in Jalaun.\n\nThe rest of the cultivating body is divided into the two great classes of tenants-at-will and tenants with rights of occupancy. In 1906 the former held 40\u00b78 per cent. and the latter 29\u00b78 per cent. of the cultivated area. These proportions have little changed during 30 years: in 1875 tenants-at-will held 40 per cent. and occupancy-tenants 24\u00b718 per cent.: the only change, therefore, has been in the direction of growth in the area held under declared rights. This is a very different result to that usually found in the Doab, but in Bundelkhand the competition is not for land but tenants, and in most cases the acquisition of occupancy rights is favourably regarded by zamindars as forming a link which binds the tenant to the land. In very few instances is their acquisition actively resisted, and tenants have always been allowed to shift their holdings with a freedom unknown north of the Jumna, without prejudice to the accrual of hereditary rights. It may with truth be said that, failing a strong body of cultivating\nproprietors, the existence of occupancy-tenants, who are usually men of some substance and position, is a source of great strength to the village in its fight against kans and other pests; while such tenants themselves if they do not belong to the proprietary body, as they often do, not infrequently date their occupancy from a time when the distinction between proprietors and tenants was little if at all defined: their prosperity is bound up with that of the village.\n\nAs the occupancy and resident tenant is a source of strength to the village, so the non-resident is a source of weakness: and throughout the district, but more especially in tahsils Orai and Kalpi, the system of pahikasht prevails to an unusual extent. Cultivation by residents of one village in the lands of another is a somewhat curious feature in a country where there is no lack of land; nor are its motives entirely clear. Cultivation so carried on is never careful or good, never pays high rents and inevitably suffers from ineffective protection. It has some advantages on the other hand from the tenant's point of view: he usually obtains land at lower rates, though this is not universally the case, and he cannot be pressed for rent. In the Betwa and Pahuj side villages there is usually but little land that will produce rabi crops, and it is not surprising to find that cultivators from these tracts migrate in large numbers to the richer fields of mar and kabar of Orai and Kunch. In 1875 no less than 32 per cent. of the area cultivated by tenants was in the hands of non-residents, and though actual figures are not available observations at the settlement of 1906 do not suggest that this proportion has much changed. In Orai, the tahsil most subject to this form of cultivation, the fall in cultivation has been greatest in those villages where it prevails to the greatest extent.\n\nRents in the district are almost universally paid in cash; only nine acres were recorded as grain-rented at settlement. Rents are realised either at old prevailing rates, the system generally prevalent in the black-soil tracts, or at lump rents for holdings containing a variety of fields or soils: in the parua belt, where the husbandry is more careful and land is scarcer, rents are modified to a larger extent by contract, and the same rule holds among special fields in other portions of the district. There are two\nspecial features of the rental system which deserve more particular notice, and which are common to the rest of Bundelkhand. The soil of Bundelkhand, when left fallow, presents a surface of such hardness that it is with difficulty broken by the plough; it also becomes rapidly overgrown with strong-rooted grasses and babul scrub. The process of reclamation is somewhat slow and costly, and it has been recognised that a special inducement must be offered to the tenant to undertake it. Accordingly a scale of rates varying with the quality of the soil and the difficulties involved in clearance have come into existence which increase annually in severity until a period fixed in advance is reached, when the full rent is taken. For instance in kabar land, the most difficult to reclaim, there are usually three progressions, and the full rent is not taken until the fourth year. A common first year's rent for inferior kabar is Rs. 0-1-0 per bigha, advancing to Rs. 0-8-0 the second, and either Re. 1 or the full rent the third year. In mar or good parua, unless they are much overgrown with babul scrub, it is most usual to give the land on a low rent or rent-free the first year, and to take a full rent the second: if much clearing has to be done, as many as three progressions may be allowed. The custom, which is known as nautor, gives rise to curious fluctuations in the rent rate and is largely responsible for the doubt which has been at times thrown on the correctness of the patwari's records. Closely allied with this practice is that of making allowances for fallow in holdings. Bad seasons, loss of cattle, spread of kans are some of the reasons which may compel a tenant to leave part of his holding uncultivated, and he is consequently unable to pay off the whole of his rent. Except in the well-populated north, it is generally more to the proprietor's advantage to take what he can get from the tenant than to eject him. Remissions are therefore allowed, roughly proportionate to the area fallen fallow: if the tenant brings the land again under cultivation, he is often allowed to pay at nautor rates. During the discussions that preceded the last revision of settlement it was freely stated that a system of chhut or remission prevailed in the district, under which a tenant in unfavourable years paid a portion of his rent only and received an acquittance for the whole. The inquiries of the Settlement officer, however, established the fact that no such\nsystem was recognised among the people, and that though remissions were undoubtedly allowed, they were submitted to by proprietors only because they could not help it; even then the system was not universal, but was practically confined to those villages where it was inexpedient to bring much pressure on the tenants, while in good villages defaulters were usually compelled to surrender what they could not cultivate.\n\nThe question of rental incidences and of changes in rates is highly complicated by the custom of letting nautor or new cultivation on easy rates. In Jalaun an additional difficulty is introduced by the fact that different portions of the district have always till the settlement of 1906 been settled at different times, and by the fact that at the most recent period a separation has been made between established and nautor cultivation. If the all-round incidence is taken at both periods it is found that in the partali tract, which includes tahsils Orai, Jalaun and the bulk of Kalpi, occupancy-tenants paid Rs. 3\u00b727 and non-occupancy-tenants Rs. 3\u00b751 per acre in 1886-87, compared with Rs. 3\u00b728 and Rs. 3\u00b713 in 1906. In the kanuni tracts of Kunch and Kalpi the rates were Rs. 3\u00b786 and 3\u00b748 respectively in 1873 compared with 3\u00b767 and 3\u00b739 in 1906. These figures would indicate that, except among occupancy tenants of the partali tract, there had been a decided fall in rents. When the kanuni settlement took place the district was in a flourishing condition and cultivation was full; at the partali cultivation was falling rapidly. It may therefore be presumed that the area of nautor at either settlement was not sufficiently extensive to disturb the rates. On the other hand at the settlement of 1906 the district was recovering from a period of depression, and there was a considerable nautor area whose temporary rates lowered the all-round rental. If the nautor rents be eliminated at the latter period, and the resultant incidences on established cultivation alone be contrasted with the all-round incidences at the kanuni and partali settlements, it will be found that occupancy tenants paid Rs. 3\u00b745 per acre and non-occupancy tenants Rs. 3\u00b751 per acre then, compared with Rs. 3\u00b758 and Rs. 3\u00b756 in 1906. Both classes of rents have risen in Kunch and Kalpi and fallen in Orai; while in Jalaun non-occupancy rates have fallen and occupancy rates slightly increased. The result over the whole district is a small rise\nin incidence, which is supported further by a comparison of rates assumed for assessment purposes. Thus in 1841 Mr. Muir fixed in Kalpi a rate of Rs. 5-2-0 for mar, Rs. 3-12-0 for kabar and Rs. 4-8-0 for parua, while at the recent settlement a rate of Rs. 5-4-0 was assumed for mar, Rs. 4-4-0 for kabar and Rs. 4-2-0 for parua, excluding gauhan, though the tract was in a relatively better condition then than in 1906. The general conclusion is that rents have, as a whole, little changed, but that the change has been, as elsewhere in Bundelkhand, unequally distributed. In three classes of villages rates have undoubtedly fallen, namely in villages wholly or largely dependent on non-resident cultivators as those in Orai, villages which have undergone deterioration owing to spread of kuns or scour of nalas, and certain alluvial villages along the Jumna where the conditions are peculiar.\n\nThe general condition of the people can be to a large extent gauged from what has been written in the preceding pages. The agricultural population, which forms so large a proportion of the total, is said to be unthrifty and indolent, backward and slovenly in its methods, incapable of struggling against adversity. This description of their character is borne out by the common saying that a Kachhi of Bundelkhand is no better as a cultivator than a Thakur of the Doab. There is much truth in these charges, but it must also be remembered these defects are largely the outcome of their circumstances. It is idle to expect habits of thrift and steady industry in persons dependant on so hazardous a means of livelihood as agriculture in this district. Its character is such that they fluctuate between plenty, won with a minimum of labour and indigence which no amount of exertion can avert; the qualities of mind and habits of life so engendered are hostile to steady and persistent effort.\n\nThough the returns to industry are uncertain, the inhabitants of the district enjoy without doubt a number of advantages over their fellows in the more crowded districts of the province. Their position as regards land, occupancy rights and rents has already been pointed out; their landlords are seldom repressive or exacting. Their clothing is coarse, but comfortable; their houses are cheaply built and warm; and their food is sufficient and wholesome, even though it often consists of what are usually regarded as the\ninferior kharif grains. But there is usually abundance of pasture land, where their buffaloes and goats can graze, and milk enters largely into the diet of the people. The large size of the average holding calls for some capital to work it and implies a certain degree of well-being among the tenants. But, whatever his position may otherwise be, the inhabitant of Jalaun is normally in want of money, and the majority are compelled to have habitual recourse to the village Bania or to apply for takavi loans from the Government. Between 1891 and 1901 an average of Rs. 42,300 was annually distributed in the district at easy rates of interest for the purchase of bullocks and seeds or for the execution of simple works of improvement. Many of the proprietors are utterly impoverished and little better off than those who are nominally their tenants, and the natural increase of families, with the progressive subdivision of the ancestral lands thereby entailed, has steadily reduced their yearly income. In 1875 there were calculated to be 15,833 proprietors of land, each representing an average revenue of Rs. 61. In 1906 the number had swollen to 25,240, paying barely Rs. 32 apiece. Between the years 1886 and 1902, 36-38 per cent. of the area of the district had been transferred, ranging from 30-06 per cent. in Kalpi to 51-98 per cent. in Orai. Though this includes the area transferred more than once, the amount is very large and points to considerable impoverishment. The operations under the Encumbered Estates Act of 1903 render it possible to form a further estimate of the indebtedness of proprietors belonging to agricultural castes. On the results of those applications to share in the benefit of the Act which were sanctioned (certain applications were refused either on the grounds that the applicant owed money to another agriculturist, or that his affairs were too hopelessly involved to admit of relief) the special judge, Mr. Stuart, estimated that the total liabilities of the proprietors belonging to these castes likely to rank good in a civil court would amount approximately to 25 lakhs. If it be assumed that those indebted form as much as four-fifths of the whole body of proprietors they owed, at a modest computation, an amount equivalent to three years\u2019 revenue. Their position has now however, by the operations of the Act, been vastly improved and they may be considered to have thrown off this load of debt.\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nADMINISTRATION AND REVENUE.\n\nThe district is administered by a magistrate and collector, in subordination to the commissioner of the Allahabad division. The staff usually consists of two full-powered deputy collectors and one deputy collector or assistant magistrate with second-class powers. There are also four tahsildars, while Raja Rup Sah of Jagamanpur and Rao Sheo Darshan Singh of Gopalpura are invested for life with the powers of third-class magistrates within the limits of their respective estates. The judicial courts consist of those of the district and sessions judge and the subordinate judge of Jhansi, and the munsif of Orai. The district forms part of the sessions division of Jhansi, where the judge resides; he comes to Orai to hold sessions on the first Monday in February, May, August and November. The remaining civil officials include the superintendent of police, the civil surgeon and his subordinates, the postmaster and the district engineer.\n\nThe first permanent foothold obtained by the British in this district was in pargana Kunch. By the treaty of December 4th, 1805, Jaswant Rao Holkar ceded a large portion of his territory including that pargana, which comprised at that time 93 villages. As an act of grace, however, the revenues of the tract were assigned as a life grant to Bhima Bai Sahiba, the daughter of Jaswant Rao, the administration remaining in the hands of the British and the pargana being annexed to the district of Bundelkhand. The next acquisition was Kalpi. Nana Gobind Rao, subahdar of Kalpi, had combined with other Maratha chiefs to resist the provisions of the agreement supplemental to the treaty of Bassein of 1803, by which was handed over to the British country situated in Bundelkhand with an estimated revenue of Rs. 36,16,000 per annum, and ceded in perpetual sovereignty \"the city, fort and zila of Kalpi and the several villages situated on the right bank of the Jumna between Kalpi and Raipur.\" On his submission, however, after the capture of Kalpi the Nana received the ilagas of Orai.\nand Muhammadabad in 1804, and the pargana of Mahoba in 1805, for his support. Kalpi and some territory round it was occupied by the British, and a promise was at the same time given that an equivalent would be made for it to the Nana. On October 23rd 1806 a treaty was concluded with Nana Gobind Rao, by virtue of which the Nana ceded 63 villages of Kalpi with an estimated revenue of Rs. 63,995 and fourteen villages of Raipur with a demand of Rs. 12,083. At the same time the Nana received in exchange 50 inland villages of Kalpi with a revenue of Rs. 73,656, 17 villages of pargana Kharka paying Rs. 19,781, 36 villages of pargana Kotra paying Rs. 39,057 and 14 in pargana Saiyidnagar with a demand of Rs. 12,874. Kalpi, like Kunch, was placed under the control of the collector of Bundelkhand, and the Nana was left in possession of his territories. By the treaty of 13th June, 1817, the Peshwa relinquished his rights of supremacy over Nana Gobind Rao and transferred them to the British. This was followed on November 1st of the same year by a treaty concluded between the Nana and the British at Jalaun, by virtue of which the latter relinquished all rights of tribute and military service from the Nana. In consideration of this the Nana ceded 44 villages \"in the ilaza of Khandeh appertaining to the pargana of Mahoba\" and four villages of pargana Churki, \"intermixed with British lands in Bhedaik and Raypur,\" on the Jumna bank. Nana Gobind Rao died in 1822, and was succeeded by Bala Rao Gobind, who died in 1832 without issue. The latter's widow, Lachhmi Bai, was permitted to adopt her brother, Gobind Rao, a child of six years of age. The state then became disorganised and in debt, and application was made to the British for a loan. Accordingly the British Government assumed the temporary control of the state in 1838, and Captain Doolan was appointed administrator. A force was also raised and equipped for the defence of the state superseding the disorderly bands previously retained, and was called the \"Jalaun Force.\" This was subsequently expanded into the Bundelkhand Legion. In the same year pargana Moth, which had up till then been held by the Jhansi chief, was put under Captain Doolan's charge. In 1840 the Jalaun chief, Gobind Rao, died and his possessions were held to have lapsed. Those possessions included parganas Jalaun, Orai, Ata and Mahoba, and, along with pargana Moth,\nformed the first Jalaun district, for Kalpi and Kunch remained attached to the Hamirpur district. Jalaun was increased in 1841 by the confiscated jagir of Chirgaon, comprising 26 villages, 52 miles south-west of Orai, and early in 1843 by parganas Duboh and Garautha, which under the treaty of December 27th, 1842, were assigned to the British Government by the Jhansi chief in payment of half the costs of the Bundelkhand Legion. The next addition came from Gwalior under the treaty of January 13th, 1844. In virtue of this treaty the Maharaja Sindhia transferred to the British parganas Bhander, Indurkhi, Mau, Mahoni, Kachhwahagarh and \"all other lands except Narwar situated to the east of the Sindh river\" for the support of the Gwalior Contingent. In 1849 the raj of Jaitpur, granted to Kesri Singh, a descendant of Chhatarsal, in 1812, lapsed. It was attached to the Jalaun district, and put in charge of the assistant in charge of the Mahoba subdivision.\n\nDuring the period from 1833 to 1853 the Jalaun district was under the management of a superintendent subordinate to the political agent and commander-in-chief. In 1853, on the lapse of Raja Gangadhar Rao, the Jhansi chief's, possessions to the British the Jhansi district was formed, and to it were added parganas Garautha, Bhander and Moth with taluqa Chirgaon. The Jhansi superintendency was also constituted and comprised the three districts of Jhansi, Jalaun and Chanderi, each administered by a deputy superintendent in subordination to the superintendent at Jhansi. At the same time Mahoba and Jaitpur were given up to Hamirpur, and parganas Kalpi and Kunch were received by Jalaun in exchange. In 1858, on the death of Holkar's daughter, the latter pargana came entirely into British hands, and both parganas which had, by attachment to the old Bundelkhand district, been till then under the ordinary regulations were deregulationised by Act XXX of 1860. The Jalaun district thereafter consisted of all that it at present contains, as well as a large tract of country to the west of the Pahuj. The last change came in 1861. By the treaty of December 12th, 1860, \"as a free gift and willing acknowledgment of His Highness Sindhia's services during the mutinies,\" the British Government granted to Gwalior territories yielding a gross revenue of Rs. 3,00,000 per annum. As a part of these the Jalaun district surrendered all its country to the west of the Pahuj, comprising 125 villages in parganas\nIndurkhi and Madhogarh and 101 villages in pargana Duboh, and was left with the dimensions which it has retained to the present day.\n\nAt the same time as the Jhansi superintendency was formed, it and the districts composing it were attached to the Saugor and Nerbudda territories, which were transferred for administrative purposes to the Government of the North-Western Provinces. In 1858 they were removed from the Saugor and Nerbudda territories and formed into a separate division under a separate commissioner, the titles of the district officers being at the same time changed from deputy superintendents to deputy commissioners. The local rules which had governed procedure up to the Mutiny were superseded by regulations formally introduced or applied. In 1862 the cadre of the Jhansi commission, together with the scale of subordinate establishments, was prescribed; and the separate judicial agency known as the pargana courts under a principal sadr amin was abolished by a resolution which blended all kinds of fiscal and judicial functions in the same person from the commissioner to tahsildar. A revised set of rules, both civil and revenue, was promulgated at the same time, and legalised by the Non-Regulation Districts, North-Western Provinces Act (XXIV of 1864), which also extended to the division the Code of Civil Procedure. The Code of Criminal Procedure which came into force in the regular provinces in 1862 was also applied to the division; and by the Jhansi Courts Act (XVIII of 1867) the jurisdiction of the courts of civil judicature was defined. Any misapprehensions as to the enactments in force were set at rest by the Scheduled Districts and Laws Local Extent Acts (XIV and XV of 1874). The Rent and Revenue Acts (XVIII of 1873 and XII of 1881) were also held to apply to the division, as it was not expressly excluded from their operation. The district remained under this system of administration till 1891, when the Jhansi commission was abolished by special enactment (Act XX of 1890, North-Western Provinces and Oudh). Jalaun was then attached along with Jhansi and Lalitpur to the Allahabad division, and all the laws in force in the present province of Agra were extended to it. The reorganization took effect from April 1st, 1891.\n\nThe district now consists of four revenue subdivisions, namely, Orai, Kalpi, Kunch and Jalaun, the latter two including the three\nchiefships of Jagamanpur, Rampura and Gopalpura. The history of the pargana divisions, with the exception of Orai, which has remained substantially unchanged since it lapsed to the British in 1840, and which contains within its boundaries all the villages of parganas Orai, Kotra, Kharka and Saiyidnagar ceded to Nana Gobind Rao by the treaty of October 23rd, 1806, is somewhat involved. Complications may to some extent be avoided by omitting all mention of the tract of country west of the Pahuj river which was finally restored to Sindhia in 1860. The district, as it existed in 1853, comprised the old parganas of Kunch and Kalpi, and those of Orai, Ata, Jalaun, Madhogarh and Kanar. In 1861 the cession of territory to Gwalior left 43 villages of pargana Indurkhi and 22 villages of pargana Duboh, lying east of the Pahuj river, in the hands of the British. These were added to pargana Kunch. In 1862 18 villages in the north of Kunch were transferred in rectification of boundaries to pargana Madhogarh, which also received four villages from Jalaun. About the same time or perhaps a little earlier the kanuni pargana of Kalpi was broken up, and its component villages distributed over Jalaun and Ata. There remained six parganas which were also tahsildaris, namely, Kunch, Orai, Ata (Kalpi), Jalaun, Madhogarh and Kanar; the headquarters of the last-named were situated at Kuthaund. In 1866, on the recommendation of Mr. P. J. White, the tahsil of Kanar was abolished and its villages distributed over Madhogarh, Jalaun and Ata; these received 43, 79 and 9 villages respectively. No other changes, with the exception of the transfer of three villages from Hamirpur to Ata, were made till 1891. In that year tahsil Madhogarh was abolished, 55 of its component villages being added to Kunch and 96 incorporated with Jalaun.\n\nOwing to these changes it is very difficult to follow the details of fiscal history; and the difficulty is increased by the fact that different portions of the district were settled and continued till 1903 to be settled at different times. The earliest settlements relate to those villages of parganas Kalpi and Kunch which came into the hands of the British in 1805 and 1806. These are generically known as the kanuni parganas, from the fact that they originally formed a portion of the old regulation district of Bundelkhand, in order to distinguish them from the non-regulation\nor partali tract, comprising the rest of the district. The former had their own settlements uninterruptedly from the cession till 1903, in spite of the fact that their component villages had long since been distributed over more than one pargana; but the partali tract was composed of two blocks of villages which came into the possession of the British at different times and were assessed by different officers.\n\nThe first regular settlement of the district may be said to be that carried out by Major Terman in 1863, and as by that time the district had assumed its present proportions it will be convenient to take that date as a starting-point. In that year there were three concurrent settlements in the district which may be summarised as the kanuni settlement, the Jalaun tract settlement and the Duboh settlement. These will now be taken in order.\n\nThe area affected by the kanuni settlements comprised 158 square miles distributed among 95 mauzas in Kunch, and 177 square miles distributed over 108 villages in Kalpi, and their history is the same as that of other parts of the old district of Bundelkhand. The first settlement was a summary one made for one year by Mr. Erskine, collector of Bundelkhand, in 1806, and amounted to Rs. 1,72,517 in Kunch and Rs. 76,285 in Kalpi. This was followed in the next year by a settlement for 3 years made by the same officer, in which the demands were raised to Rs. 1,75,929 and Rs. 84,396 respectively. In 1810 a resettlement was carried out by Mr. John Wauchope, agent to the Governor-General at Banda, who raised the total jamas to Rs. 1,84,742 and Rs. 89,416. The term of settlement was nominally for three years, but owing to bad seasons in 1812 and 1813 the term was extended for three years more, and did not conclude till 1816. The demand fixed by Mr. Wauchope was a progressive one, and though no enhancement was ever imposed on Kalpi the revenue of Kunch rose in the last year of the settlement to Rs. 1,89,781. The enhancement, which was in itself large, was rendered considerably more burdensome by the necessity imposed on the zamindars under regulation of paying their revenue in Farrukhabad rupees instead of the miscellaneous coinage of the tract. This change of currency was calculated to have involved in itself an enhancement of $1\\frac{1}{2}$ per cent. In 1816 the \"ever-memorable settlement\" of Bundelkhand was made by Mr. Scott Waring. An officer of boundless\nzeal and energy, he visited every portion of the enormous tract then under his charge at least twice, but he seems to have been thoroughly deceived by the great prosperity through which the country was then passing. His main idea appears to have been that he was being imposed on by zamindars and officials alike; and though he fully discussed each pargana in detail, giving tables of the cost of production, the average amount of produce and similar information, he was doggedly tenacious of opinions once formed. The net result of his assessments was an increase of the revenue of Kunch to Rs. 2,16,533 and of that of Kalpi to Rs. 1,15,394. The settlement was a quinquennial one, and was revised in 1821 and again in 1826 by Mr. Valpy, who embraced Mr. Waring\u2019s views with even greater enthusiasm. The ruin which fell on many of the zamindars from the enhancement imposed by Mr. Waring seems to have left Mr. Valpy unmoved, while \u201cthe anxiety which ousted zamindars naturally evinced to recover possession of their patrimonial inheritance was construed into an irrefragable proof of the lightness of the settlement: and though compelled by glaring instances of excessive assessment to grant reductions he allowed no opportunity to escape of demanding an augmentation, and that frequently as the punishment of previous recusancy!\u201d By Mr. Valpy the demand was raised in Kunch to Rs. 2,18,140, but reduced in Kalpi to Rs. 1,12,514: the latter demand was further reduced in 1826 to Rs. 1,05,349. The next settlement was made nominally by Mr. Cathcart, the collector, but really by Mr. Ainslie, the commissioner. He left the demand in Kunch practically unchanged, but reduced that in Kalpi to Rs. 93,067: and the further revision made in 1836 by Mr. Pidcock made little alteration in the total jamas, though many inequalities in assessment were adjusted. The net result of the settlements from 1815 to 1840 was an enormous increase of revenue, left unchanged in Kunch but followed by large reductions in Kalpi. The former pargana suffered much less than the latter, and its immunity from the worst effects of over-assessment was ascribed to the extreme fertility of its soil, the presence of a large population of Kurmis, the confidence and security arising from a uniform and generally equal assessment, the continuance of the soils in the hands of its original owners, and to the absence of a host of speculators who devastated the\nother parganas of Bundelkhand. With Kalpi the case was different. Even on the demand of Rs. 89,585, fixed in 1814, an annual balance exceeding Rs. 4,000 had resulted; and though the annual balances during the ten years from 1816 to 1826 were not much above Rs. 3,000, they subsequently increased one-third. Mr. Muir wrote in 1842: \"Drained at last of its wealth, the pargana refused to yield the revenue with . . . facility . . . So strongly had the fatal seeds of over-assessment now taken root that the further remission in 1831 of above Rs. 12,000 made no impression, and the annual balance increased to Rs. 5,632. The ninth settlement of 1836, though it gave large temporary relief, afforded but little ultimate reduction, and failed therefore to apply the only remedy which could effect a permanent cure. The balances in this settlement instead of falling off have greatly increased; they amount to an average of Rs. 12,000, or excluding the year of famine to above Rs. 7,000.\" Speaking of the general state of the parganas from 1826 onwards, and the effects of the subsequent settlements, he continued: \"The zamindars who had engaged were reduced to abject poverty, and of the insane speculators none at last were left: they had retired from the scene impoverished or ruined.\" The parganas were desolated by scarcities or famines in 1830, 1834 and 1838, and \"no one,\" he wrote, \"who has not toiled through the details of each village can conceive the extent of alienation of property or the misery attendant on the depopulation of villages, the ruin of estates and the disruption of society which has prevailed in this unhappy country.\" As regards Mr. Macleod's reductions in 1831, Mr. Muir wrote: \"The settlement of Mr. Waring resembled an auction, in which the highest bidder was sure of his object; but this [was] a lottery, in which unlooked-for prizes fell to those who least expected them. Glaring inequality of assessment now embittered the temper of those who received no relief, and who were already callous and hardened from continual oppression. While this settlement, therefore, relieved some estates of their burdens, its operations were utterly inadequate to the necessities of the case, and in some cases only added to the previous evils.\" Finally with reference to Mr. Pidcock's reductions, which did not however embrace the whole of the parganas, he wrote that \"the decrease was\ndistributed with great care and judgment . . . . This revision must be regarded as eminently more successful than any of its predecessors.\"\n\nThe tenth settlement of the kanuni tract was carried out by Mr. (afterwards Sir William) Muir between 1840 and 1841. This settlement was based on a double classification of soils and villages. The soils were first accurately demarcated, and as they were found to run generally in tracts, villages were classified accordingly. Next rent rates were sought for in each species of land, and average rates were drawn up. The results of the latter applied to the cultivated area furnished a jama which was compared with the present and past assessments. This however appeared unquestionably too high, and the history of old settlements convinced Sir William Muir that the demand must be confined to the average of the general produce. The average surplus, he maintained, must cover the actual losses sustained by the zamindars from land thrown out of cultivation, the uncertainty which in Bundelkhand depreciates what is really obtained, and the high rates of interest at which money had to be borrowed. He accordingly reduced his rates in accordance with what he thought suitable from a careful survey of the financial history of each pargana. But as a matter of fact in the ultimate assessment very little attention was paid to rates, and the demand fixed on each village was practically that which all indications, but especially those of its fiscal history, pointed to as the most suitable. The revenue of Kunch was reduced to Rs. 2,02,798 and that of Kalpi to Rs. 78,335.\n\nWe must now turn to what may be called the Jalaun tract. This at first comprised the lapsed parganas of the old Jalaun state, consisting of parganas Orai, Jalaun, Kanar and Ata. In 1839, when Lieutenant Doolan was appointed superintendent of the state, he assessed these summarily for six months. In 1840 a second settlement was made by him for one year at Rs. 3,41,151. In 1841 Captain Doolan made a quinquennial settlement for the Jalaun parganas at Rs. 4,61,529, and in 1844 he assessed 119 villages of Madhogarh and 39 of Indurkhi then received from Sindhia at Rs. 1,09,452 for one year.* A quinquennial settlement\n\n* No records are forthcoming regarding the 22 Duboh villages.\nwas made for the whole in 1846 by Lieutenant Ross, Captain Doolan's successor, who assessed Rs. 6,09,694 on 623 villages. \"All these settlements were summary settlements, based on inaccurate measurements and on Maratha documents, showing a revenue much above what the country could properly pay and prosper.\" The last summary settlement was carried out in 1851 by Major Erskine (afterwards Earl of Kellic), who assessed 627 villages* comprised in the above-mentioned parganas at Rs. 6,56,532. This demand was sanctioned for a period of five years and was to prepare the way for regular settlement. In 1853 Major Erskine introduced the Panjab system of patwari measurement by plane table, and the detailed survey was completed in 1856, all papers being lodged in the offices at Orai. But in June 1857 the Mutiny broke out and all records were destroyed by the rebels. The entire years 1858, 1859 and 1860 up till August were consumed in restoring the civil administration of the district; but, as a temporary measure of relief, the summary demands fixed by Major Erskine in 1851 were revised by Major Maclean. Owing to the large losses incurred during the Mutiny the remission of Rs. 42,016 was found necessary, reducing the total demand to Rs. 6,14,516. In September 1860 Major Ternan took up the control of affairs and made preparations for the new settlement. The rough field maps and boundary maps were called in from patwaris, and as they were found sufficiently reliable in all except 131 villages which were remeasured, the khataunis were at once prepared to put the assessments in train. Between September 1860 and May 1863 Major Ternan imposed assessments and reported them for sanction, but he was compelled in the latter year to proceed to England on sick leave and he left the village statements unprepared. This task was taken up by Major Corbett; but his work as deputy commissioner absorbed most of his time, and in November 1863, owing to the confusion that existed with reference to muafi lands, Mr. P. J. White was deputed to conclude settlement operations. The work carried out by Mr. White consisted in the first place of the completion of the village records. The main heads of his task were, firstly, to prepare a full and accurate record of the rights and interests of all the proprietors of land; and, secondly,\n\n* The increase of four villages was due to four resumed ubaris from pargana Duboh.\nto revise Major Ternan's proceedings, which had often been summary and incorrect in the matter of the resumption of muafi lands, and to decide with whom the proprietorship of those lands lay. This labour was ended in February 1865, and really closes what may be called the first regular settlement of the Jalaun tract. Major Ternan's assessments* stood at Rs. 6,12,920, but Rs. 16,503 of this amount was a nominal assessment on estates held revenue-free and Rs. 4,756 was quit-rent on the Jagamanpur jagir. If these sums are deducted the effective assessment was Rs. 5,91,663, but even this included Rs. 60,520 assessed on resumed land which had paid no revenue before; and the revenue assessed on the same villages as those of Major Erskine's settlement, reduced by this sum, amounted to Rs. 5,31,143, only a decrease of 19\u00b71 per cent. on Major Erskine's demand and 13\u00b75 per cent. on the demand as reduced by Major Maclean. The assessment was not made on any systematic or scientific plan. Its basis was a special set of rates for each village instead of average rates, and it was made chiefly on the jama'andis checked by general reference to the rates at which the revenue so calculated would fall as compared with neighbouring villages, and influenced by local inquiry and personal knowledge of the circumstances and assets. Mr. White's operations resulted in an increase of Rs. 6,768 on Major Ternan's assessments: this sum was assessed on resumed estates and raised the total demand to Rs. 6,19,796.\n\nIn spite of their rough-and-ready character the assessments were generally fair, and are still gratefully remembered by the zamindars. Before, however, the results were reported for final sanction the discussion regarding a permanent settlement and its applicability to Jalaun ensued. Orders were accordingly issued for a thorough examination of the survey papers and rent-rolls, with a view to the revision of the assessments. The work of measurement was commenced in November 1865 and concluded in December 1866, and disclosed a considerable amount of error both as to the area of the land and as to the classification of soils. In all 75 villages were entirely remeasured and many corrections were made,\n\n---\n\n* They affected 676 villages. Fifty villages, which had been included by Major Erskine as hamlets of other villages, were separately assessed and the remainder of the excess over the number of villages assessed by Major Erskine was due to resumptions.\nand the cultivated area was found to be larger by 23,025 acres than before. A discussion next ensued regarding the necessity of fresh rent rates for the revised assessments. The commissioner submitted that the tract was a backward one with an excess of culturable waste, and that a rise in rents was certainly to be looked for. Finally, in July 1867, the Board of Revenue decided that the district was not fit for permanent settlement, and Mr. White was directed to complete the settlement records, altering Major Ternan's demand according to the new system of calculation* prescribed by Government, and to report \"if it should incidentally come to his knowledge that the assessment was too high or too low.\" This work occupied Mr. White till April 1869. In the course of it the demand on 78 villages was altered: in 55 villages it was raised from Rs. 77,588 to Rs. 95,033, and in 23 villages it was lowered from Rs. 18,136 to Rs. 14,065. In the remaining 594 villages Major Ternan's consolidated demand was unaltered, but by the changed system of calculation the part credited to cesses was increased, leaving the land revenue proper at Rs. 5,02,993. The total demand, after revisions by the commissioner, amounted to Rs. 6,18,144, and as it stood finally was considered on the whole a light one. It was sanctioned for a period of only 20 years, owing to the backward nature of the tract and the expectation of a rapid extension of cultivation due to improved communications and the construction of the Betwa canal, which was then under discussion. The term fixed ran from July 1863 to June 1882.\n\nThe resettlement of Kunch and Kalpi followed. The demand fixed on Kunch by Sir William Muir in 1841, amounting to Rs. 2,02,798, had subsequently increased by the lapse of muafi villages to Rs. 2,11,426. In 1859 Captain Maclean reported that the yearly average of the uncollected demands was Rs. 38,387, and he was authorized to make summary remissions on manifestly overburdened estates by forming \"a rough estimate of relief absolutely necessary.\" His proceedings resulted in an aggregate remission on 52 estates, amounting to Rs. 27,844, which reduced the demand to Rs. 1,83,582. The case of Kalpi was somewhat different. Sir\n\n---\n\n* This was to fix a consolidated demand at 55 per cent. of the assets, of which 5 should be cesses and 50 land revenue. The practical effect of this was to keep the consolidated demand unaltered, but to transfer a small sum from revenue to cesses, and thus to lower the revenue generally.\nWilliam Muir's original demand was one of Rs. 65,099 rising to its full amount of Rs. 78,335 only in the twentieth year; the relief it gave was very great, and in 1860 no difficulty was found in imposing the whole sum. Mr. White's assessment of Kunch was based on prevailing rates per bigha in each variety of soil, and discounted 15 per cent. on an average over the whole pargana to cover the contingencies of seasons. These rates were sanctioned by the Board, but the method of discounting them was disapproved by the Lieutenant-Governor. The settlement officer was directed to base his assessments on full rates, making any reductions he thought necessary in individual villages which were below the average or which had previously suffered from over-assessment. On the reduced rates the revenue of Kunch amounted to Rs. 1,58,000; but the demand, as finally revised in the light of the above orders, came to Rs. 1,93,934. The same principle of reduced revenue rates in Kalpi, approved by the Board, gave village assessments in that pargana of Rs. 93,562 which were submitted for sanction in 1870. Government however, as in the case of Kunch, objected to the method of reducing rates, and remarked \"that the nature of the rates used for assessment is not sufficiently clear. From paragraphs 3 and 6 of Mr. White's memorandum, it would seem that they are somewhat lower than the full rates and are called current average rents, and are due to the custom of taking reduced rents in bad years (called dekha prakhhi*). The Lieutenant-Govenor has no objection to this principle, but it should be precisely explained what the rates so assumed are, and how they are obtained. They should be contrasted with full rates and the rental therefrom resulting, and the mode in which the reduced rent rate is worked out and what it represents as assessment shown.\" After the submission of explanations by Mr. White, His Honour approved of the principle laid down by the Board, namely, to use as a guide to assessment the full current rates of rent, and then to assess below the full rates, making allowances for the variations of seasons and losses from\n\n* This is described at length by Mr. White in section 64 of the Kalpi report. It literally means the appraisement of the crop at the close of the season. A deduction from the rental, called chhut, was alleged to be given, corresponding to the extent of crop failure, if such occurred. Mr. White's point was that such crop failure always occurred, and that the amount of remission was never entered in the jamabandis, but that it ought to be allowed for in assessment.\ndeduction or bad debts on account of the deficiencies of the crop. The proposed revenue was thus made to approximate nearer to the amount worked out according to the full than to the reduced average rates, the former giving a revenue of Rs. 99,326 and the latter one of Rs. 83,951. The amount actually assessed, after some reductions had been made by superior authority, was Rs. 91,255, and was sanctioned by Government in 1874. Both settlements were fixed for a term of 30 years.\n\nIt remains now to describe the settlement of pargana Duboh. As already explained, after the retrocession of territory to Gwalior in 1861, 22 villages belonging to pargana Duboh, lying to the east of the Pahuj river, remained in the hands of the British. These villages were first regularly settled by Mr. Freeling in 1856 at 50 per cent. of the assets for a period of twenty years running from July 1st, 1856, to June 30th, 1876. Four of their number were subsequently included by Major Terman in his settlement of the Jalaun tract in 1863, because, as he stated, \"their former standing of privileged tenures had been resumed.\" About 1870 one village, Sahjoni, was transferred to Samthar, leaving 17* in which Mr. Freeling's demand amounted to Rs. 16,311. The incidence of the revenue being considered fair and the zamindars being content, Mr. White recommended in 1873, when the question of resurvey and resettlement was brought up, that the term of the current assessments should be prolonged to June 30th, 1883, when the settlement of the Jalaun tract was due to fall in. This proposal was sanctioned by the Government on February 18th, 1873, and when the resettlement of that portion of the district was undertaken the 17 Duboh villages were included in it.\n\nThe settlement of the Jalaun tract was due to fall in in 1883, and in pursuance of instructions received from the Supreme Government in 1881 an inquiry was made in 1883 \"to ascertain whether it was necessary and expedient on financial or administrative grounds to undertake a resettlement of the Jalaun tract, and on what principles the resettlement, if decided upon, could be best effected.\" A note drawn up by Mr. White showed that an\n\n---\n\n* These villages lie in the extreme south-west of Kunch tahsil and comprise Aibru, Uchagron, Barhal, Bilehta, Bohara, Behda, Phulela, Pipri Kalau, Joyatpura Gujar, Jagdespur, Chatsari, Dadpura, Dabar, Dheyra, Salay Buzurg, Kodala and Kailia.\nincreased revenue of 1\u00bd to 2 lakhs of rupees might be expected, and that there was no necessity for either a fresh survey or for the preparation of a new record-of-rights, except in the case of the 17 Duboh villages, of which the records were obsolete and untrustworthy. That officer not only advocated a resettlement on account of a substantial return in the shape of increased revenue, but urged that there was administrative necessity for it in order to rectify the inequalities of the incidence of revenue arising from the want of system in the plan of assessment followed at the last settlement. The general principles according to which resettlement of the Jalaun tract was to be conducted were laid down in G. O. no. 1495/1-61.14 of 15th December 1884, and subsequently embodied in a complete set of rules. They provided briefly that no fresh survey or preparation of new records should be undertaken except in the 17 Duboh villages; that the assessment of the new revenue should be based, as far as possible, on the average actual recorded rental corrected where necessary for assumption land; that in the cases of rent-rolls which were rejected the soil areas of the holdings should be valued at rates ascertained to be actually paid by tenants for land of similar quality in the vicinity; that 25 per cent. should be deducted from the valuation of sir land, and that cultivating proprietors should be treated leniently. The work of settlement on these principles was carried out between September 1885 and August 1887, settlement operations being declared finally closed in March 1888. The old assessments were continued in Jalaun and Orai till 1886, and in the rest of the tract till November 1887. The revenue assessed by Mr. White, after corrections by the commissioner and the Board, stood at Rs. 7,54,229, giving an increase of Rs. 1,25,755, or 20 per cent., including Rs. 13,891 newly assessed on resumed estates. It was recommended for sanction for a term of 20 years; but after a full consideration of the subject it was decided to extend it only for the term of 16 years, so that it might conclude for the sake of uniformity with that of the Kunch and Kalpi kanuni tract in 1903.\n\nThe enhancement made in 1886-87 was very unevenly distributed. It fell with great severity on pargana Orai, the revenue of which was raised by 28\u00b720 per cent., contributing 38\u00b746 per cent. of the total enhancement; and on pargana Jalaun, where the increase\nwas 17.9 per cent, and the percentage of the total enhancement 31.71 per cent. Within these parganas the burden fell mainly on a particular class of village, namely those with good mar soil. The settlement came at an unfortunate time. Agricultural depression had set in, population was falling, and kans appeared and spread with great rapidity. The resultant falling-off in cultivation was imputed by the settlement officer to intentional concealment, and where cultivation fell short of the average of the past six seasons assessment was based on the average of those years. Unrented areas were valued at non-occupancy rates and the allowance for proprietary cultivation was limited to sir which was not sublet. By the time the assessment of the partali portions of Kalpi, Kunch and Madhogarh came under review, the Board had directed that the rate to be applied to unrented areas was to be the rate paid by occupancy and non-occupancy tenants combined, with the result that these parganas were treated with more moderation. Still over the whole district some very heavy assessments were taken from individual villages. In the hanuni portions of the district the assessments of 1874 were generally severe, while those of Kalpi, where they had a fair chance, are said to have worked well.\n\nThe character of the seasons following this settlement was generally unfavourable and they were characterised by very heavy rain. In 1889 the collector reported arrears amounting to Rs. 21,557, the great bulk of which had accrued in the villages situated in the neutral belt of mixed kabar and parwa in pargana Jalaun and in a somewhat similar area of pargana Kalpi; in the same year 14 villages of the former tract were under attachment and in 1890 the settlement of 10 was annulled. In the two following years the district enjoyed fairly good harvests, but none the less arrears continued to accumulate and successive collectors confessed their inability to realize the revenue and pressed for a lightening of the demand. At the end of 1891 the arrears stood at Rs. 45,136 and in the following year Rs. 30,034 were wiped off. Meanwhile the district was reported to be in \"a condition of progressive decay;\" \"the revenue was hero and there unbearable. In several villages lately attached the total rents do not amount to the revenue and cesses.\" In 1892 a revision was ordered in villages \"where the assets are for the present insufficient to meet the Government demand;\" it was carried out by\nMr. Steel and resulted in a reduction of Rs. 37,273. Events however proved that the revision had far too limited a scope. Calamities befell the tract every year and a second revision by Mr. Fremantle in 1896 made a further reduction of Rs. 34,866 in the demand. This revision was effected before the full effects of the famine of 1896-97 were apparent; balances continued heavy, especially in pargana Orai; at the end of 1899-1900 they amounted to Rs. 98,582, and in the following year to Rs. 1,71,774, nearly all of which was remitted. At length in 1901 what are known as the ordinary and special reductions were made, which brought the revenue down from Rs. 9,74,460 to Rs. 8,33,082 and Rs. 8,02,753.\n\nIn 1903 the term of both settlements prevailing in the district was due to expire. But the hopeless breakdown of the assessments in the district during the previous 10 years had brought to the front once more the question of a fluctuating system. As early as 1879* Sir Charles Crosthwaite, who was then officiating Judicial Commissioner of the Central Provinces, had suggested the application of some form of fluctuating assessments to tracts such as Bundelkhand. He advocated the fixation of a minimum demand, payable in all seasons, but maintained that this demand should cover a certain area of cultivation; any excess area should pay a full revenue when cultivated, but nothing if uncultivated or if the crops absolutely failed. In 1890-91 Mr. (afterwards Sir James) LaTouche carried out some sliding scale experiments in some Government mahals in the Banda district, but the method did not meet with the approval of Government.\u2020 In 1899 a proposal was made that the demand should be fixed as a permanent demand on a standard area, with the condition that all cultivation in excess of this standard should be charged at revenue rates applicable to the villages and the excess revenue so realized should be credited to an insurance fund. In years in which the area of cultivation fell below the standard area and the fixed revenue demand could not be recovered, the balance to the credit of the village in the insurance fund could be devoted to the discharge of the arrears. This scheme\u2021 was rejected\n\n---\n\n* Quoted in Government of India's no. 406, dated the 5th February 1895, reviewing the settlement of the Jalaun tract.\n\u2020 G. O. no. 1339, dated the 3rd June 1892.\n\u2021 Board's letter no. 493N., dated the 7th June 1899.\nby the Government as not differing materially from the scheme advocated by Mr. LaTouche as collector of Banda. The question however of the exact method in which fluctuating assessments could best be made was postponed for decision till experience had been gained of the experiment proposed and put into operation in various parts of Bundelkhand between 1896 and 1898 by Mr. S. H. Fremantle. The essentials of this scheme were that in villages where that officer had revised the demand the revenue should be increased if cultivation extended with reference to the extension of cultivation in the circle in which it would be included for this purpose. It was found however in 1900 that villages in which cultivation had largely increased escaped an enhancement because others in the same circle had remained stationary; while others, entitled to relief, might, if the cultivated area of the circle remained stationary or increased, continue to pay their old or even an enhanced demand. In that year Mr. Rose, as junior member of the Board, suggested that villages in which some method of fluctuating assessments was necessary should be marked off by the settlement officer, and that in such villages the revenue demand should be fixed on a normal area at 45 per cent. of the assets, and should be liable to no variation unless the cultivated area increased or decreased 20 per cent., the corresponding increase or decrease of revenue to be calculated at the revenue incidence fixed on the normal area. In reply to this the Government of India* proposed to grant more lenient terms and suggested combining the rules for fluctuations of area with those for remissions and suspensions on account of crop failures, \"the amount of revenue leviable each year being regulated by the resulting percentage of out-turn on the normal.\" In an exhaustive minute\u2020 Mr. H. F. Evans, senior member of the Board of Revenue, reviewed the whole question of fluctuations in Bundelkhand and the possible methods of relief. He established the necessity for short-term settlements, the term of which he recommended to be five years, and fixed 10 per cent. as the limit of ordinary fluctuations. As regards the valuation of the area of increase or decrease, he advocated the fixation of a revenue rate per village, after the exclusion of sayar receipts and\n\n* No. 1806\u2014175-2, dated the 7th August 1901.\n\u2020 Board's letter no. 4713N. I-38(a), dated the 9th October 1901.\nland of exceptional value from consideration. New cultivation or nautor areas ought, he thought, to be disregarded till they became established in the fifth year; and finally, experience having shown that in practice a tenant only paid rent for the amount of land he actually cultivated, he preferred that the rentals of all fallow land should be excluded.\n\nThe suggestions contained in that minute are substantially those now embodied in the rules for assessment in Bundelkhand. The Local Government in 1902 modified them to the extent that nautor areas should be separately assessed at a low valuation; that this class of land should be separately recorded every year; and that increases and decreases of established areas only should be considered for purposes of revision and that they should be valued at an all-round rate. At the same time, after some controversy, nautor was declared to be all cultivated land other than that which had been cultivated continuously for four years, breaks of one year only being disregarded. The Jalaun district was the first to be resettled under these rules, as it had been previously the first in which the Panjab system of plane table had been employed and in which settlement had been based on recorded rent-rolls. After a complete resurvey of the district, settlement was commenced in 1903 by Mr. H. R. C. Hailey, who, with the help of Mr. M. Keane, completed it in October 1905. The system of soil classification, the fixing of rates and the valuation of assumption areas were governed by the ordinary rules in force for settlements in the United Provinces. Under the special rules, the rents of fallow land included in holdings were separately extracted and discarded, all cultivation was divided into established and nautor, the latter being valued at low all-round rates and the valuation added to the assets as siwai, and sayai receipts were leniently treated. Liberal reductions were given for proprietary cultivation, and a total demand of Rs. 8,21,913 at 47\u00b776 per cent. of the net assets was fixed for the whole district, subject to quinquennial revision according to fluctuations in cultivated area. In each village incidences for future use in both established and nautor areas were determined. The incidence of the revenue assessed on established cultivation fell at Re 1\u00b762 and of that on nautor at Re \u00b753 per acre; this gave a general rate of Re 1\u00b750 per acre compared with one of Re 1\u00b774 at the previous\nsettlements. The demand involved a reduction of 23\u00b749 per cent. on that of the old settlement and of 17\u00b718 on the revenue on the roll in 1902, after the summary reductions of 1901. Subject to ordinary revision in accordance with the rules it was sanctioned by the Government for a period of 30 years.\n\nMeanwhile another matter of urgent importance had been brought to the notice of the Government. This was the extent of the alienations by, and the indebtedness of, the proprietors in Bundelkhand, which had been greatly increased by over-assessment and the agricultural depression of the previous 15 years. In 1903 an Act was introduced into the Legislative Council of the United Provinces for the relief of those whose property was encumbered with debts. Under its provisions a systematic inquiry took place into debts, followed, where possible, by a liquidation, and special judges were appointed to deal with the matter. The operations under the Act fell into three stages. Applications under the Act from distressed proprietors were first submitted to the collector, who subjected them to a preliminary scrutiny. Every effort was made by advertisement of the Act to induce encumbered owners to apply, and the collector was authorized himself to submit applications on behalf of those who were unwilling to apply when he thought fit. Applications held to be valid by the collector were submitted to commissioners appointed under the Act. They were then examined by the commissioners in the light of rules issued by the Government, and those that were considered suitable for inquiry were sent to the special judges. The second stage was the investigation into the nature and extent of the proprietors' debts and the determination on an equitable basis of the amount due to the creditor. This proceeding was of a judicial character and was conducted by the special judge. The final stage was the liquidation by collectors of the awards in the various ways specified by the Act. In the Jalaun district the total number of applications filed by zamindars and the collector was 4,197, out of which 3,020 were sent to the commissioner and 2,322 referred by the commissioner to the special judge. The amount claimed amounted to Rs. 35,30,973, of which Rs. 22,98,028 were reckoned as being likely to hold good in an ordinary civil court. Claims to the number of 7,683 were made before the special judge, on which a sum of\nRs. 16,15,496 only was awarded. In the final stage of the cases decided by the special judge, liquidation was found impossible in 63; in 164 others the award was satisfied in part only, but the balance was deemed to be discharged; while in 1,599 the award was discharged in full either by the debtor himself or with the help of a Government loan. The total sum advanced by the Government for this purpose amounted to Rs. 8,98,126.\n\nThe special inquiries set on foot previous to the introduction of the Bundelkhand Encumbered Estates Act of 1903 disclosed the fact that in the district of Jalaun the indebtedness of the proprietors was most serious, and in the \"statement of objects and reasons\" appended to that measure it was said that the revision of settlement on a new system afforded a suitable opportunity for applying the provisions of the Jhansi Encumbered Estates Act (XVI of 1882) to the tract. In a similar statement appended to the Alienation of Land Act (II of 1903) it was stated that the attempts made in the years 1882-87 to relieve the indebted proprietors of the Jhansi district did not meet with the degree of success anticipated, partly because a measure which was strongly advocated at the time\u2014the limitation of the landholder's power to transfer his land\u2014was not adopted. \"In these circumstances,\" it was added, \"it is proposed to extend to Bundelkhand, with such modification as may be necessary, the law recently introduced in the Panjab for the restriction of alienation of agricultural land.\" The bill introduced into the legislative council was a measure of far-reaching importance. It prohibited, except under the sanction of the collector, any permanent alienation of land except by the non-agricultural tribes, or between members of the same agricultural tribe,* or between members of any agricultural tribe provided that both were residents of the same district as that in which the land to be transferred was situated. In addition to this, temporary alienations of land by the agricultural tribes were restricted to mortgages without possession, or to usufructuary mortgages and leases for a term not exceeding 20 years, while all conditions intended to act by way of conditional sale were absolutely interdicted. The Act has not as yet been long enough in operation for any definite conclusions to be drawn; but there is\n\n* The tribes deemed \"agricultural\" for the purposes of the Act were specially notified in the Gazette, 1903, part V, page 490.\nevery reason to believe that it will prevent the land from passing out of the hands of cultivating proprietors into those of capitalists and money-lenders.\n\nFor the purposes of police administration the district is at present divided into 14 police circles. The boundaries of these circles coincide with fiscal subdivisions, each tahsil containing three or more. There are six first-class stations, at Orai, Kunch, Jalaun, Kalpi, Madhogarh and Rendhar; five second-class stations, at Ait, Ata, Churkhi, Hadrukh and Kuthaund; while those at Mau, Mohana and Saiyidnagar are third-class. The police jurisdiction of Orai is divided between the circles of Orai, Ait, Mohana and Saiyidnagar; that of Kunch between Kunch, Mau and Rendhar; that of Kalpi between Kalpi, Churkhi and Ata; and that of Jalaun between Jalaun, Kuthaund, Hadrukh and Madhogarh. During the last 30 years there have been considerable reductions in the number of police stations, and those at Bangra, Bhenra, Kailia and Ingol in tahsil Kunch; Gohan in Jalaun; Damras, Itaura, Babina and Nipania in Kalpi; and Kaitheri and Hardoi in tahsil Orai have been abolished. In 1871 there were 26 police stations in the district, including one at Jagamanpur in the jagir of the same name, and one at Atraulia in the Gopalpura estate. Under the reorganisation scheme, recently sanctioned, the station of Mau will be shortly removed to Kailia, the Hadrukh circle will be abolished, and instead of separate stations at Mohana and Saiyidnagar a single circle will be formed with headquarters at Jaisari Kalan.\n\nThe police force is under the control of the district superintendent, subordinate to whom is a reserve inspector and one circle inspector. The regular civil police force consists of 17 sub-inspectors, 24 head constables and 214 constables posted at the various stations, and 2 sub-inspectors, 10 head constables and 68 men in reserve. The armed police comprises 11 head constables and 48 men distributed among the stations at Jalaun, Madhogarh, Rendhar, Kunch, Mau, Kalpi and Ait for treasury guard or for patrol duty in the border tracts; and 21 head constables with 110 men in reserve. There are now no municipal police, but at Jalaun and Madhogarh there are 27 town constables enrolled under Act XX of 1856. In addition to those 121 road police patrol the main lines of communication, especially the Jhansi-Cawnpore road and that\nleading from Jalaun to Shergarh-ghat; and there are 1,109 village chaukidars.\n\nStatistics of criminal justice and cognizable crime for each year since 1896 will be found in the appendix.* From these it will be seen that the criminal work is not particularly heavy in ordinary years, but, as is usually the case elsewhere, the volume of crime considerably increases in years of agricultural distress such as 1906. The most common crimes are of course theft and its allies, in which must be included cattle theft, an offence which has existed from time immemorial in the portions of Bundelkhand which border on native states. Offences affecting life vary from year to year but are not numerous, though cases in which grievous hurt are involved are not infrequent. The number of people convicted of offences against the public tranquillity or bound over to keep the peace is not great, and in this respect the inhabitants of the district may be considered law-abiding and well-behaved. On the other hand the district had long in common with other portions of Bundelkhand an evil notoriety for robbery and dacoity, this form of violence being very frequently indulged in by Rajputs and Gujars when pressed by hard times, or committed by residents of the neighbouring districts aided and abetted by their friends within Jalaun. Even this however has decreased greatly of recent years, and it has been found possible to withdraw some of the police establishments along the Gwalior border, though a patrol is still maintained and armed police are quartered at the border stations to cope with any outbreak. In earlier days the large number of thefts and burglaries that took place was ascribed to the village chaukidars, who consisted for the most part of men of the Khangar caste. In 1871 no less than 29 of these men were dismissed and 21 punished for criminal offences. Very great improvement however in the habits of those men has taken place, and other castes besides Khangars have been gradually induced to take service as chaukidars. The contiguity of foreign territory makes the conditions for cattle theft and robbery extremely favourable. It would be impossible to stamp out these forms of crime, but the reduction in their number and the withdrawal of police establishments clearly demonstrate the efficiency of the control now exercised.\n\nAppendix, tables VII and VIII.\nIn former years the practice of infanticide was undoubtedly very prevalent in the district, especially among the Sengars and other Rajput tribes of high descent. The first repressive measures were taken very soon after the passing of the Act for the Prevention of Female Infanticide (Act VIII of 1870), and in 1871* the Sengars, Kachhwahas, Gaurs and Parihars of every pargana of the district were proclaimed as tribes against whom measures under the Act would be taken. In 1876 Rahtors, Panwars, Kanwars and Dhakras of selected villages were added to the list. The provisions of the Act were not necessarily applied to every village inhabited by these clans, and constant changes were made from time to time in bringing selected villages on or off the register. In 1888 the Government directed that a census should be taken among all the suspected clans with a view to discovering what effect the measures for prevention had had and how far the Act could be withdrawn. There were at that time 56 villages proclaimed; and of proclaimed tribes Sengars existed in 17, Kachhwahas in 24, Parihars in 7, Gaurs in 4, Rathors in 4, Dhakras in 2 and Khangars in 3. In 1890 the results of this enumeration among all the suspected tribes were submitted and the Government reviewed the situation. The entire number of villages where these tribes were found was divided into five classes: in the case of seven the Act remained in force; 61 previously proclaimed were exempted; one was reproclaimed; 246 previously exempt were left exempt, and 40 were suspected and retained subject to the provisions of the Act till a fresh census could be taken in 1892-93. The number on the register has since been further reduced from time to time, on the annual reports of the inspector-general of police, and in 1905 there were only four villages proclaimed, namely Marora, Rajpura, Bhitora and Garha. In 1906 the question of withdrawing the Act altogether from the provinces came under consideration; and finally in August of that year the Act was withdrawn with the proviso that the four villages above-mentioned should be carefully watched and the statistics of male and female infants re-examined after five years.\n\nThere is only one jail in the district, situated in headquarters at Orai. It is a third-class jail, capable of accommodating between 150 and 300 prisoners. The total number of admissions in 1907\n\n* Notification no. 369A., dated 22nd March 1871.\nwas 175 males and 16 females. No manufactures of any importance are carried on in it, the industries being the same as those enforced in similar institutions. The buildings date in part from 1841 and the daily average of inmates during the last four years was 140 persons, of whom 7 were females.\n\nExcise has formed a part of the Government revenue ever since the district came under British control. After the trial of the auction system at fixed and modified rates in 1869 and 1871, the farming system was introduced into the district in 1872 and remained in force for the remainder of the century. In 1900 a change was made from the farming to the outstill system, which now prevails throughout the district. The average receipts from 1877 to 1899 under the farming system amounted to Rs. 9,220 only and showed very small fluctuations. Under the outstill system from 1900 to 1907 the average has risen to Rs. 18,120\u2014a considerable improvement. From 1877 to 1883 the number of shops for the sale of country liquor was never less than 233, but in the latter year extensive reductions were made and from that date till 1893 only 130 shops were maintained. A further curtailment took place in 1894, and since the outstill system has been in force there has been an average of 105 shops open: in 1907 there were 94 only.\n\nNo hemp drugs are manufactured in Jalaun and the sale is confined to imported products. In former days ganja of the pathar variety from Gwalior was largely consumed, and the consumption rose as high as 170 maunds in 1893-94. Its place has now been taken largely by charas, but the trade in both is subject to great fluctuations. During the last ten years an average of four maunds seven sers of charas and six maunds 30 sers of ganja has been sold. But besides these there is a considerable demand for hemp in the shape of bhang imported by licensed vendors, the average sales during the last 10 years being $37\\frac{1}{2}$ maunds. There are in all 83 drug shops in the district. Prior to 1897 drugs were imported by licensees direct and the only source of revenue was the license fees, which averaged from 1893 to 1897 Rs. 2,050. In 1897 the bonded warehouse system was instituted for ganja and charas, while the plan of auctioning the license fees for longer periods than a year was introduced. The receipts have improved in\nconsequence of this and the imposition of higher duties on drugs, and the average between 1898 and 1907 amounts to Rs. 4,426.\n\nOpium.\n\nThe consumption of opium is moderate and constant, but shows a slight tendency to decrease. From 1877 to 1887 an average of 26 maunds and from 1888 to 1897 an average of 27\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) maunds was sold. For the last decennial period from 1898 to 1907 the amount has fallen to 23 maunds, and has never exceeded 25 in any single year. There are in all only nine shops for the retail sale of opium in the district. During the same period the receipts have averaged Rs. 10,647, opium being sold to vendors at Rs. 18 a scr and retailed by them at five or six annas a tolu.\n\nExcise administration is usually entrusted to a full powered assistant or deputy collector on the district staff, and since 1901 a peripatetic inspector has been appointed to the district for the prevention and detection of offenses against the excise laws. The chiefs of Rampura, Jagannapur and Gopalpura enjoy the entire revenue from excise and make all arrangements for its collection within the limits of their own estates. As regards country liquor, they are authorized to manufacture and sell it at their own shops, but, as in the rest of the district, it has to be distinctively coloured red. As regards opium, they or their contractors are obliged to purchase it from Government treasuries, and in the case of hemp drugs they obtain it from the bonded warehouses established in the province, subject to the ordinary rates of duty.\n\nIncome-tax.\n\nThe collection of income-tax under the present system dates from the introduction of Act II of 1886, which imposed a very different tax from what levied under the old Acts of 1860, 1863, 1867 and 1870. Under the last-mentioned Act (XVI of 1870) income-tax was assessed at the rate of half an anna in every rupee on incomes over Rs. 500, and in 1870-71 there were 1,400 such incomes. Under Act II of 1886 no account was taken of incomes derived from agriculture, and in 1904 all incomes amounting to Rs. 999 and under were exempted from the tax. Statistics of assesseees and collections since 1894, both for the whole district and for the various tahsils, will be found in the appendix.* The average receipts from 1905-06 to 1907-08 have been Rs. 10,600 paid by 246 assesseees. The largest number of assesseees is in tahsil\n\n* Appendix, tables XIII and XIV.\nJalaun, followed by Kunch, and those tahsils pay the largest amount of the tax.\n\nWhen the Jalaun district was under a superintendent, the office of registrar appears to have been held by the principal sadr amin at headquarters; but on the formation of the Jhansi division, the duty devolved upon the deputy commissioner. The district was then divided for the purpose of registration into subdistricts whose limits coincided generally with those of parganas. In 1881 the areas of districts and subdistricts were defined, and a subdistrict was formed out of each of the parganas of Orai, Jalaun, Kalpi, Kunch and Madhogarh. On the abolition of the Jhansi division in 1891 the old districts of Jhansi, Jalaun and Lalitpur were formed for the purposes of registration into a single district of which the district judge became ex-officio registrar, and at the same time the subdistrict of Madhogarh was abolished and its area distributed over Kunch and Jalaun. At the present time there are four subdistricts whose limits correspond with those of the tahsils; in three of these, namely Kalpi, Kunch and Jalaun, the tahsildar is ex-officio sub-registrar, while at Orai is stationed a departmental officer to carry on the work. In 1870-71 there were 1,036 documents registered under the provisions of the Act then in force (VIII of 1871), on which fees to the amount of Rs. 2,312 were collected. Thirty years later, in 1900-01, the number of documents amounted to 1,173 and the fees to Rs. 2,219, against total charges of Rs. 1,347. During the four years ending in 1907 863 documents have been registered on the average every year, and Rs. 1,776 received in fees, compared with charges of Rs. 1,464. The heaviest work is done at the Orai office.\n\nA table given in the appendix shows the annual income derived from stamps since 1891.* Stamp duties are collected under the Indian Stamp Act (II of 1899) and the Court-Fees Act (VII of 1870). In 1870-71 the total net receipts amounted to Rs. 34,858 under all heads, and this sum rose 30 years later to Rs. 47,107. During the five years ending in 1907 the average income has been Rs. 47,706, two-thirds of which is derived from court-fee stamps, including copies, and one-third from non-judicial stamps. The average annual charges for the same period have been Rs. 1,415,\n\n* Appendix, table XII.\nand neither under the head of income nor expenditure has there been any appreciable change during 15 years.\n\nThe history of postal arrangements in the district is the same as that elsewhere. In early times the main channel of communication between this and districts north of the Jumna appears to have been via Kalpi and Cawnpore. The distribution of letters within the district was undertaken by the district authorities. In 1864 the district dak was abolished and the management of all postal matters was undertaken by the postal department, which established regular offices wherever this was deemed necessary. Offices under the control of the district authorities have now ceased to exist. At the present time, in addition to the head office at Orai, there are five sub-offices and 22 branch offices situated within the district, while two offices, at Kadaura in the Baoni state and at Jigni in the Jigni jagir, are administered as if they were in the district.\n\nThe main telegraph line runs alongside the Jhansi-Cawnpore section of the Great Indian Peninsula railway. Besides this there are branch lines to Kunch and Jalaun. Combined post and telegraph offices exist at Orai, Kalpi, Kunch and Jalaun, the last having only been established as a combined office in 1908. The office at Kadaura in Baoni is also a combined office. A list of all the post or combined post and telegraph offices existing in 1908 will be found in the appendix.\n\nLocal self-government is represented in the district by three municipalities, two Act XX towns and the district board. The municipalities are Orai, Kunch and Kalpi.\n\nThe town of Orai was brought under the provisions of Act XX of 1856 soon after the passing of that Act. In 1871 the Municipal Improvements Act (VI of 1868) was extended to it, under which the elective principle was introduced and authorization given for the levy of octroi dues. In 1872 these together with a tax on houses and a toll on carts were first imposed, but two years later the toll was cancelled. In 1902 the octroi schedule was revised and a tax on houses, buildings and lands situated within the municipality at the rate of five per cent. on the annual value was imposed; and in the same year the rules at present in force for the election of members in the municipality were drawn up. The municipal board, of which the magistrate is ex-officio chairman,\nconsists of nine members, three being appointed and the remainder being elected from the various wards. The work of secretary is entrusted to a paid servant of the board. Most of the income is derived from octroi dues and a house-tax, but it is supplemented by miscellaneous items such as pound receipts and fines. The annual receipts from 1901 to 1905 averaged Rs. 11,240. During the same period the expenditure amounted to Rs. 10,452, the bulk of which was devoted to administration, conservancy, dispensaries and schools. The annual income and expenditure from 1890 to 1900 averaged Rs. 9,052 and Rs. 8,868 respectively. The Vaccination Act (XIII of 1880) was extended to the municipality in 1891; and section 34 of the Police Act (V of 1861) has been in operation since 1862.\n\nKalpi was constituted a municipality in 1867, but its boundaries were not accurately defined till 1879. Octroi was first imposed in 1886. The municipal board, of which the district magistrate is ex-officio chairman, consists of nine members, three of whom hold office by appointment and six are elected from the various wards according to the revised rules published in 1902. A tax on weighmen was imposed in 1893 and one on meat in 1897. From those sources together with octroi, nazul rents and miscellaneous fees the main income of the municipality is derived. From 1891 to 1900 the annual receipts averaged Rs. 10,746, and between 1901 and 1905 they were Rs. 13,805. During the same periods the expenditure amounted on an average to Rs. 10,937 and Rs. 13,505 respectively. The office of secretary is now held by a paid servant of the board. The Vaccination Act (XIII of 1880), first applied in 1892, and the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act (XI of 1890), first imposed in 1902, are in force within the limits of the town, and section 34 of the Police Act V of 1861 has been in force since 1866.\n\nThe town of Kunch was constituted a municipality in 1867 at the same time as Kalpi, its boundaries being defined in the following year. The constitution of the committee nominated under Act VI of 1868 to control revenue and expenditure has been modified under the various Municipal Acts since passed; and at the present time, by rules laid down in 1905 under Act I of 1900, the board is made up of nine members, three being appointed and six elected, while the magistrate is ex-officio chairman. The income, which is chiefly\nderived from octroi, a tax on trades and professions first imposed in 1876, and a tax on weighmen imposed in 1902, has shown considerable expansion during the last few years and from 1901 to 1905 averaged Rs. 19,576, compared with Rs. 12,682 in the preceding decade; the expenditure during the same period has amounted on the average to Rs. 18,990. The Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act (XI of 1890) was extended to Kunch in 1902, and the Vaccination Act (XIII of 1880) in 1891, while section 34 of the Police Act (V of 1861) has been in operation since 1866.\n\nThere are two places administered under Act XX of 1856. These are Jalaun and Madhogarh, both of which were made subject to the Act in 1860. The income is in both cases derived from the usual house-tax, and details of receipts and expenditure will be found in the articles on those places. In addition to the chaukidari tax, weighing dues and slaughter-house fees supplement the income. Both towns have been brought under the operation of section 34 of the Police Act (V of 1861), Jalaun in 1866 and Madhogarh in 1889. The provisions of Act XX of 1856 were withdrawn from Saiyidnagar in 1901 and from Kotra in 1906.\n\nBeyond the limits of the municipalities local affairs are administered by the district board, which in its present form dates from 1884. The board consists of an elected chairman who is usually the district magistrate, three appointed members and 12 members elected annually for a term of three years, three from each tahsil. The work of the board is of the usual description, and its principal duties comprise the management of the educational, medical and veterinary establishments; communications, including local roads, ferries, bungalows and the like; and several minor departments such as the administration of cattle-pounds, portions of nazul land and the maintenance of roadside avenues. The income and expenditure of the board under the main heads since 1891 will be found in the appendix.\n\nThe history of state education in Jalaun commences only after the Mutiny. During the latter part of 1858 nine tahsili schools were opened at Jalaun, Ata, Kalpi, Orai, Kunch, Duboh, Kuthaund, Lahar and Madhogarh. There were at that time 102 indigenous private schools in the district as then constituted, attended by 1,228 pupils, but it was not till 1861-62 that the halqabandi system was\nintroduced. In that year, owing to the cession of territory to Gwalior, the district lost two tahsili schools at Lahar and Duboh; while a third, that at Ata, was closed, others being established at Kotra and Umri. In 1863, the number of halqabandi schools was 42, attended by 1,139 scholars, and though it was found possible to establish one anglo-vernaacular school at Kalpi, three tahsili schools at Kotra, Umri and Madhogarh had to be closed for want of attendance. A beginning was made with female education at Kunch in February 1866 by opening a school, which however attracted only Musalman girls: and later in the same year three more were opened, one at Orai and two in Ata. The same year also saw the foundation of a second anglo-vernaacular school at Jalaun; and in 1867 a third at Orai, which had grown up out of the tahsili school, was converted into a zila school. In 1870 all educational institutions were reported to be making rapid progress, and besides the three English schools there were five tahsili schools attended by 226 boys, 66 halqabandi schools attended by 1,701, 24 indigenous schools with 462 pupils, and five female schools, two at Jalaun and one each at Orai, Kunch and Madhogarh, with 73 scholars on the rolls. A new zila school at Kalpi was opened by the Lieutenant-Governor in 1871, and in 1874-75 six municipal schools at Kunch, Orai and Kalpi were started, the number being increased to seven by the establishment of a free school at Jalaun in the following year. From this time onward education seems to have made rapid progress in the district, and in 1880 there was one English school with 22 scholars, 13 middle vernacular schools attended by 35 scholars, 2 primary English schools with 81, and 87 primary vernacular schools, of which four were aided, with an average number of 2,421 scholars on the roll during the year. There was only one Government girls' school, which was attended by 24 girls.\n\nA table showing the number of institutions and pupils in each year since 1896, together with a list of all the schools in existence in 1908, will be found in the appendix.* From the latter it will be seen that there are six vernacular secondary schools, 26 upper primary and 47 lower primary schools in the district, all of which are managed by the district board: five of the last are the lower branches\n\n* Appendix, table XVIII, et seq.\nof the middle schools. The girls' schools under the same controlling authority now amount to four; they are all lower primary schools and situated at Sirsa Kalan, Umri, Gohan and Hadrukh. Besides these there are two upper primary and three lower primary schools for boys and two girls' schools at Orai, Kunch and Kalpi, managed by the municipal boards. In addition to all these schools there are 16 institutions of the upper primary and 25 of the lower primary standard, which receive grants-in-aid from the district board, while the chiefs of Jagamanpur, Rampura and Gopalpur maintain two of each kind within their own jagirs.\n\nJalaun takes a high place among the districts of the province as regards the literacy of its inhabitants. Of these 4\u00b74 per cent. were ascertained at the census of 1901 to be able to read and write. The total percentage exceeds that of any other Bundelkhand district, the proportion as regards males rising as high as 8\u00b735, while that of females, amounting to 1\u00b74, is exceeded only by Jhansi. The proportion of literate males is almost equal among Hindus and Musalmans, but Musalman females considerably excel their Hindu sisters; while in comparison with other districts of Bundelkhand the proportion of literate Musalman males is the smallest in the tract. The progress of education in Jalaun appears to have made rapid strides, especially among the males; for in 1881 only 6\u00b74 per cent. of their number were literate and in 1891 only 7\u00b70 per cent. Of those literate in the vernaculars only 87 per cent. knew the Nagri and 5 per cent. the Persian script, the remainder being acquainted in some degree with both.\n\nThe medical institutions of the district comprise the sadr dispensary at Orai, founded before the Mutiny and raised to the first class in 1865, and four branch dispensaries situated at Kalpi, Kunch, Jalaun and Madhogarh. That at Kunch is in charge of an assistant surgeon, but the others are entrusted to hospital assistants. In addition to these there is a female dispensary of the second class at Orai which was opened in 1896. Recently a new hospital has been erected at Orai to accommodate 30 indoor patients at a cost of Rs. 33,000.\n\nThere are at present eighteen cattle-pounds in the district, situated at Orai, Saiyidnagar, Ait and Mohana in tahsil Orai; at Kalpi, Itaura, Babina, Churkhi and Ata in tahsil Kalpi; at Jalaun,\nHadrukh, Kuthaund, Gohan and Madhogarh in tahsil Jalaun; and at Kunch, Bangra, Beona and Pirona in tahsil Kunch. Those at Orai, Kalpi and Kunch are managed by the municipalities of those towns, and the income is credited to municipal funds; but the remainder are administered by the district board.\n\nA large area of *nazul* land is administered by the district board, while the remainder is under the management of the collector and the various municipal boards. In the first are comprised 84 miles of metalled and 540 miles of unmetalled road, and 360 acres covered by ruined forts; the latter bring in an income of approximately Rs. 300 annually, and there are 43 acres of grove land. The area managed directly by the collector consists now only of some 260 acres of Government encamping-grounds. Some portions of these are annually leased out for cultivation at a rental of about Rs. 460 per annum. The municipal board at Kunch derives about Rs. 100 from the rent of shops in the *Manik Chawk*, and some Rs. 537 from that of cultivated land within the limits of the town; while at Kalpi there are some 64 acres of cultivated and grove land, which bring in an income of a little over Rs. 100 per annum. At Orai the land on which the civil station is built is known as *Arasi Laharia* and comprises some 50 acres. The occupants of the bungalows built on it pay *malikana* to the municipality, and part is also cultivated. This, together with the *parao* or encamping-ground, contributes about Rs. 110 annually to municipal funds.\nCHAPTER V.\n\nHISTORY.\n\nThe materials for constructing the early history of the Jalaun district are even more meagre than those for other portions of Bundelkhand. The district has no traditions regarding its earliest occupants, and epigraphical or archaeological remains have nowhere being found in it relating to an early period of history. Like other portions of the tract, its earliest occupants were probably Bhils and similar tribes, but from its greater fertility and less wild and broken character, it was occupied earlier than other portions of Bundelkhand by Aryan immigrants. There is no reason to doubt that it formed successively part of the dominions of the Maurya and Gupta dynasties; but it is likely that it fell into Toramana's hands about 500 A.D. and passed into those of his successor, Mihiragula. From this time is perhaps to be dated the settling of the Gujars, if not actually in the district, at any rate in parts contiguous to it. The district certainly fell within the kingdom ruled over by Harsha Vardhana from 606 to 648 A.D. It is during his reign that we get our first historical notice of Bundelkhand. The country to the south of the Jumna was known as Jejabhukti or Jejahoti,* and was described by the Chinese traveller, Hiuen Tsang, about 642 A.D. It was ruled over by a Brahman, whose capital was probably at Eran, and who was a firm believer in Buddhism: the soil was rich, and the crops were abundant, and pulse and wheat were products. On Harsha's death a period of confusion ensued, and from that time the sovereignty of the tract probably belonged to the rulers of Kanauj. About 810 A.D. the throne of Kanauj was seized by Nagabhatta, the ambitious ruler of the Gurjara-Pratihar kingdom in Rajputana, the capital of which was at Bhinmal, and passed about 840 A.D. to his grandson, Mihira, usually known as Bhoja, who was unquestionably a very powerful monarch, ruling over the whole of the central portion of Northern India.\n\n* For this and Chandel history, vide Indian Antiquary, volume XXXVII, May 1908.\nMeanwhile the Chandel power was being consolidated at Khajurahu and Mahoba, and the power of Kanauj, which had received a severe blow from the Rashtrakuta king, Indra III of Central India, about 916 A.D., was further weakened by the attacks of King Yasovarman Chandel between 940 and 950 A.D. This ambitious prince vastly increased the power and confirmed the stability of his dynasty by the conquest and occupation of the fortress of Kalinjar. An inscription dated 954 A.D. informs us that he had waged successful wars with the Gaudas, Khasas, Kosalas, Kasmiras, Mithilas, Malavas, Chhodis and Gurjaras, and the same record gives us a valuable account concerning the extent of the dominions of his son, Dhanga, the ally of Jaipal, King of Bathindah, who was disastrously defeated by Sabuktigin in 989 A.D.\n\nThe western frontier was marked by the town of Bhasvat on the \"river of Malava,\" which seems to be meant for Bhilsa on the Betwa. His northern boundary was the Jumna, and on the north-west his frontier touched, and perhaps included, Gopadri, or Gwalior, which Vajradaman wrested from the grasp of the Kanauj sovereign and probably held as a feudatory of Dhanga.\n\nThe history of the Chandel Kings is much more closely associated with the districts of Banda, Hamirpur and Jhansi; their rule extended to, but appears little to have affected, this district. One tradition says that Kalpi was one of the eight great Chandel forts; but it is unsupported by archaeological evidence, and it is probable that their power was less evident in the tracts distant from headquarters. In the palmy days of Chandel rule, under Madanavarma and Paramardi or Parmal (1128 to 1182 A.D.), the limits of their dominion certainly extended as far west as the Sindh river, and the tract between that stream and the Pahuj was possibly a border land, which now belonged to one and now to another of the contending paramount lords of Northern India. At any rate when Prithvi Raj, the Chauhan ruler of Ajmer and Dehli, led his expedition against Parmal in 1182 A.D., he was met by the Chandel forces at Sirswagarh* on the Pahuj, which appears to have been the frontier of their kingdom.\n\n* In native territory to the west of Jalann. Others place the scene of the battle at Bairagarh, 14 miles south-west of Orai, near the Betwa between Sirswagarh and Rahat, 10 miles east of Erichh (vide Cunningham, Archaeological Reports, volume II, page 455).\ndisastrous fight which took place there left the way open for the advance on Mahoba, and, with the capture of that place, the Chandels ceased to be the ruling power in this portion of Bundelkhand.\n\nFrom the beginning of the 13th century the district, through its most important place Kalpi, becomes intimately associated with the Muhammadans. The capture of Dehli, Kanauj and Benares by Shahab-ud-din in 1193 A.D., followed by the surrender of Kalpi and Gwalior in 1196 A.D. and of Kalinjar in 1202 A.D. to Qutb-ud-din Aibak, completed the reduction of Upper India. This reduction however seems to have implied something very far short of subjection, for frequent expeditions against rebellious chieftains south of the Jumna were conducted, by Qutb-ud-din\u2019s successors during the thirteenth century. So far as the internal history of the district is concerned, however, the most important event of the period was the irruption and settling of various castes and clans; of these the most important were the Kachhwaha and Bundela Rajputs. Of the actual residents of the country at the time we have no exact knowledge, but there is some evidence to support the tradition that, during the bulk of the century, an ill-defined tract of country stretching from Mahoba on the east to the Pahuj river on the west was in the hands of the Khangars, who, from their headquarters at Kurar or Garh Kurar,* are said to have ruled the land as vassals of the Dehli Court.\n\nTradition ascribes the origin of the Bundelas to Pancham\u2020, the son of Birbhadr, last Gaharwar Raja of Benares. The story told is that Birbhadr, during his lifetime, divided his kingdom among his sons, giving half to the four elder and half to the youngest and favourite son, Pancham. The division not unnaturally caused much ill-feeling, with the result that when the father died\u2021 Pancham was expelled and his share divided among his four brothers. Pancham in great distress went to the famous shrine of Bindhachal, five miles west of Mirzapur, and practised the most severe asceticism in honour of the goddess Durga. After several days of fasting and other penances, he resolved to offer\n\n* In Orchha territory, about 20 miles north-east of Jhansi.\n\u2020 J. A. S. B., volume LXXI, part I, 1902.\n\u2021 The date given is 1170 A.D.\nhis own head as a sacrifice: but before his determination was consummated, the goddess spoke and promised him that he would become a king. Pancham however asked for a visible sign, and on not receiving one resumed his religious chants, took his sword and tried to cut his throat. The goddess thereupon appeared and told him that his descendants would rule over Central India, and that in commemoration of the drop (bund) of blood that fell from his self-inflicted wound, his descendants would be called Bundelas. Pancham then collected his followers, defeated his brothers, and seized the kingdom and made Benares his eastern capital. Pancham is said to have named his son Bir Bundela, and to have sent him to oppose the advance of Tatar Khan,* Afghan, in 1193 A.D. Bir Bundela ascended the throne in 1214 A.D., and extended his kingdom to the west, north and south. In 1231 he is said to have subdued Kalpi and Mahoni, and to have annexed Kalinjar, and some eighty years later, or in 1313 A.D., his grandson Arjunpal came and made Mahoni his capital.\n\nThe Bundelas form an endogamous group with Panwars and Dhundheras; but as they claim to be Gaharwars, possibly the change of name indicates the fact of some intermarriage in the past with an inferior clan. It cannot now be determined with whom the Gaharwar forefather of the Bundelas intermarried, but the westerly migration of the Benares Gaharwars possibly had some connection with that of their namesakes of Kanauj, who, after the desolation of their city, left it to found a state in Rajputana. The first fixed settlement of the Bundelas was at Mau Mahoni, in the wild and broken country which lines the Pahuj river on the western boundary of Kunch. Arjunpal, who fixed his capital here, is said to have had three sons, namely Birbal, Sohanpal, and Dayapal. The first is stated to have succeeded his father, and the second is reported to have captured Kutharagarh and to have raised the standard of victory long in Jaitra. Another account says that, on Birbal's accession, only a few villages were given to Sohanpal by his brother and that he, dissatisfied with his share of the inheritance, determined to strike a blow for his rights. With this object he went first to Naga, the Khangar Raja of Kurar and asked for help. This was promised by the Khangar chief on condition that Sohanpal\n\n* A variant is Satar Khan, Afghan, presumably a lieutenant of Shahab-ud-din.\nwould eat, drink and intermarry with his house\u2014a suggestion which so enraged Sohanpal that he resolved to leave Kurar forthwith. Hearing of his intention Naga formed a plot to detain him by force in order to compel him to accede to these proposals, but Sohanpal fled secretly from his court. He next turned to Mukatman Chauhan, who commanded a body of troops on behalf of the Naga, but he would not promise to do more than remain neutral. A mission to the Sengars, Chauhans, and Kachhwahas met with no better success; but one Panpal, jagirdar of Karhara, lent a ready ear to his intercession, and concocted a plot with him to remove Naga by stratagem from his kingdom, which was worth 13 lakhs. It was agreed that Sohanpal should go to Kurar and pretend to accept Naga's conditions of intermarriage, and invite the Raja and his relations to his house. The plot was carried out as agreed. Naga with his brothers and ministers came to Sohanpal's house and were treacherously slaughtered by Panpal and Sohanpal and their followers. This story appears to mean that the Bundelas under Sohanpal towards the end of the 13th century captured Kurar,* and made themselves masters of the territory formerly ruled over by the Khangars. The Bundela dominions were divided into two portions; for, while Birbal retained the tract handed down to him by his father round Mahoni, Sohanpal carved out a principality for himself further south: probably Kunch tahsil and portions of Orai and Jalaun were reckoned in the power of the elder brother. During the succeeding century the younger branch completely eclipsed the elder, which for the rest of its existence appears to have remained with the rest of the district in entire subjection to the Dehli Emperors. We read of no trouble in this quarter, and in the orderly administration of the empire introduced by Firoz Shah in 1378 A.D., Kalpi, which probably included the bulk of the district, formed a feof which was entrusted to a deputy from court.\n\nWhen next we hear of Kalpi, about 1400 A.D., it is found combined with Mahoba (formerly in the feof of Karra and Mahoba) as a feof in the hands of Mahmud Khan,\u2020 son of Malikzada\n\n* The date given is 2nd Kartik Samvat, 1345 or 1288 A.D., J. A. S. B., LXXI, part I, 1902.\n\u2020 E. H. I., IV., 37.\nFiroz, who, like other amirs and maliks, utilised the confusion ensuing on Timur's invasion of India to secure a semi-independent control of the territories to which he had previously been appointed. The town rose about this time into a place of first-class importance. Its possession was eagerly sought after by the Sharqi Kings of Jaunpur as well as by the aspirants to the Dehli throne, but it appears to have remained in the power of the latter after Ibrahim Shah retired from his advance on Dehli in 1407 A.D. In 1412 A.D. Ibrahim laid siege to Kalpi, but was compelled to retreat by a force sent against him by Daulat Khan, who then held supreme power at Dehli. In 1426 A.D. Kadir Khan,* son of Sultan Mahmud Khan, was governor of Kalpi in subordination to Saiyid Mubarak Shah of Dehli. While the latter was engaged in hostilities with Muhammad Khan, his vassal at Biana, Ibrahim Shah, took the opportunity of once more advancing on Dehli by way of Kalpi. Saiyid Mubarak turned back to meet him and a battle was fought in the Etawah district, as a result of which Ibrahim Sharqi retired to Jaunpur. In 1432 A.D. Ibrahim Shah made another attempt on Kalpi, but on this occasion was opposed by Alp Khan, better known as Hoshang Shah, King of Malwa, who had formed the design of capturing the place. The Jaunpur chief retired under fear of an attack by the Dehli troops and Kalpi fell into the hands of Hoshang. It now appears to have remained for some years in the hands of the Malwa Kings, for in 1442 A.D. Mahmud Sharqi, son of Ibrahim, who succeeded his father in 1440, is found complaining to the King of Malwa that his vassal at Kalpi was neglectful of the laws of Islam and requesting and obtaining permission to chastise him. When however Mahmud had captured and plundered the place, he refused to restore it, and two years afterwards the King of Jaunpur met the Malwa chief at Erichh, where a treaty was patched up; by virtue of this Nasir Khan, son of the former governor, Kadir Khan, was appointed governor. The struggle for the mastery of Northern India which had been carried on by Ibrahim Sharqi against the Saiyid Kings of Delhi was continued by his successor, Sultan Husain, against the Lodis. The Jaunpur power was advanced beyond the fortress of Etawah, and in 1465\n\n* E. H. I., IV, 63.\nSultan Husain forced Rai Karan Singh, Raja of Gwalior, to pay him tribute. As Sultan Husain retraced his steps towards Jaunpur after his last attempt to gain possession of Delhi, the Gwalior Raja sent a body of troops to accompany him to Kalpi. In 1488 Bahlol Lodi advanced from Delhi against Husain. Capturing Etawah from Sultan Husain's brother, Ibrahim Khan, he proceeded to attack the Jaunpur chief. The armies met at Ranganw,* near Kalpi, and Sultan Husain fled without striking a blow to Rewah. Henceforth Kalpi and its dependencies were absorbed in the provinces immediately subordinate to Delhi, and on Bahlol Lodi's return from Jaunpur in the same year, the scot of Kalpi was conferred on Azam Humayun, his grandson.\n\nSikandar Lodi, soon after his accession, resumed Kalpi from his nephew, Azam Humayun, and bestowed it on Mahmud Khan Lodi. How long the latter remained in possession is uncertain; but in 1507 A.D. the governor of the town was Jalal Khan Lodi, the emperor's son, who was later in the same year presented with the whole of the Kalpi sarkar in jagir. On the accession of Ibrahim Lodi, in 1517 A.D., the Afghan nobles bestowed the government of Jaunpur on Jalal Khan and set him up as an independent chief under the title of Sultan Jalal-ud-din. The latter still retained possession of Kalpi, and leaving his whole family and treasure in the place marched with 30,000 men towards Agra, in order to overawe and, if possible, occupy the capital. Ibrahim however attacked Kalpi in his rear and after a short siege took it and gave it over to plunder. Jalal-ud-din now driven to extremities signed a treaty, drawn up by one of Ibrahim's generals, agreeing to resign his pretensions. The treaty was disallowed by his brother Ibrahim Lodi, and Jalal-ud-din fled to Gwalior and Malwa where he was subsequently caught, handed over to Ibrahim and put to death. The government of Kalpi was then conferred on one Ali Khan \u2020. The latter was one of the Afghan nobles who refused to submit to Babar after the battle of Panipat in 1526 A.D.; but soon after, on his return from Jaunpur, Humayun induced him to submit and accompany him to court, where he was\n\n* E. H. I., V, 89.\n\u2020 E. H. I. IV, 263.\nFerishta calls him Alum Khan (Brigg's Ferishta, volume II, 49).\nreceived with due honours. And thus before his death Babar was able to say that he included the important fortress and foof in his possessions: in 1528* he himself passed through the district, crossing the Jumna at Kanar, on his way to Kanauj. Immediately on Humayun's succession to the throne in 1530 A.D. he found himself compelled to set out to oppose Sher Khan, whose power had been slowly consolidated over Bihar and Bengal. Sensible of the importance of the contest, he committed Kalpi, the gate of the west, to his cousin, Yadgar Muhammad Mirza. After the defeat of the Mughals at Baksar in 1539 Sher Khan alias Sher Shah sent his son Qutb Khan\u2020 to raise disturbances in the direction of Malwa. Yadgar Muhammad Mirza having joined forces with Kasim Husain Khan, governor of Etawah, met and defeated the Afghan forces in a hotly contested battle near Kalpi, in which Qutb Khan was slain; but after Humayun's defeat two years later at Kanauj (1540 A.D.) Kalpi fell with the remainder of the empire into the hands of Sher Shah, who organised his dominions into systematic foofs and divisions. Kalpi at this time was conferred on Mallu Khan, who not caring for service under Sher Shah fled to Gujarat. During the sixteenth century Kalpi seems to have become the favourite halting place between Dehli and Bengal, and during the reigns of the remaining Sur emperors it became the theatre of almost continuous warfare. In 1554 Ibrahim Khan Sur \u2021 appears to have gained possession of it, but to have been very soon driven out by Himu, the minister of the emperor Muhammad Shah Adali. Meanwhile Muhammad Khan Sur, who was at this time ruler of Bengal, advanced with the intention of capturing Jaunpur, Kalpi and Agra. He was however met by Adali in person, who had been joined by Himu, and was totally defeated at Chappaghata,\u00a7 about 22 miles from Kalpi. Muhammad Khan was never again seen and is supposed to have been drowned in the Jumna, while Adali advanced to Bengal against Muhammad Khan's son, and ultimately met his death at Monghyr. Soon after Northern India was overrun by the Mughals,\n\n* E. H. I., IV, 262.\n\u2020 E. H. I., V. 130. Ibid. 204.\n\u2021 E. H. I., IV, 507 and V., 243. Ibrahim defeated a force sent against him by Adali under Isa Khan Niazi near Kalpi.\n\u00a7 E. H. I., IV, 507.\nand Kalpi become once more a dependency of Dehli: its first governor was the well known soldier Abdullah Khan Uzbek.\n\nIn the territorial organization of Akbar the district as now constituted fell into two sarkars. In this scheme Kalpi gave its name to a large tract of country in the subah of Agra, which lay on both sides of the river Jumna and comprised parganas which are now included in the Etawah, Cawnpore and Hamirpur districts as well as that of Jalaun. The northern and eastern portion of the district fell within the mahals of Kanar, Bhadek, Raipur, Kalpi and Muhammadabad in the sarkar of Kalpi, and the south-western portion in those of Kunch and Khaksis in the sarkar of Erichh. The mahal Orai had an area of 95,779 bighas paying a revenue of 1,297,379 dams, 72,213 dams being suyurghal: it contributed 20 horsemen and 500 infantry to the army. That of Muhammadabad had, with 184,080 bighas, an area almost double that of Orai, but paid only 167,257 dams revenue with 4,260\u00bd dams suyurghal: its contingent to the imperial army was 50 horsemen and 1,000 infantry. These two mahals comprehended probably the whole of the present tahsil of Orai together with small portions of Jalaun and Kalpi, and were evidently, especially Orai, well cultivated tracts of country. Neither of Kanar nor of Kalpi is the area given in the Ain-i-Akbari, but the former which probably included much country now in Gwalior territory, paid a revenue of 4,943,096 dams with 6,085 dams suyurghal and provided 100 horsemen and 2,000 foot soldiers for the army. Consisting as it did of much broken country near the junction of the Pahuj and Sindh, its area appears to have been imperfectly known, but, unless it extended far to the south, it could not have been large. The high revenue is accounted for by the fact that it included part of the most fertile tract of the district, namely, that in the north of parganas Madhogarh and Jalaun. Kalpi, with the suburban mahal, formed two mahals known as Haveli and Belda, paying a revenue of 4,871,053 dams with 203,909 dams suyurghal and contributing, with 4,000 infantry and 5,000 horse, the largest body of troops in the whole sarkar. Between Kanar and Kalpi lay the mahals of Bhadek and Raipur; but the latter may possibly have extended round Kalpi to the south, for in later days it is found coupled with Itaura as the pargana of Raipur-Itaura. Bhadek, like Kanar, was evidently a well cultivated tract, for it paid a revenue\nof 1,260,199 dams on an area of 72,931 bighas, only 3,414 dams being suyurghal; it also provided 50 horsemen and 2,000 foot to the army. Raipur had the smaller area of only 43,166 bighas assessed to the small sum of 120,000 dams, and provided only 500 footmen. In the sarkar of Erichh the mahal of Kunch with its area of 155,320 bighas probably extended over portions of the present Samthar state. It paid a revenue of 1,851,802 dams; 27,71205 dams were suyurghal, and its military contingent amounted to horse and 2,000 foot. The smaller mahal of Khaksis having an area of 89,233 bighas comprised the northern portion of the present tahsil of Kunch, a part of Jalaun and the intruding tract of Datia territory round Nadiaagaon: it was assessed at 1,343,073 dams revenue, 7,673 dams were suyurghal, and it provided 50 horsemen and 1,000 infantry to the imperial forces. Only three mahals, namely Raipur, Kalpi and Kanar, were called upon to provide elephants, and it is interesting to note that there is other evidence to show that the neighbourhood of the great fortress was in the days of Akbar a well wooded domesne in which the Delhi emperors were able to indulge in the sport of hunting this animal. The distribution of castes appears to have been the same then as it is now: Sengar Rajputs predominated in Kanar, Kachhwahas in Khaksis, other Rajputs in Raipur and Kalpi, and Kurmis in Muhammadabad and Kunch. Kalpi itself had a mint for copper coinage.\n\nDuring the reigns of Akbar, Jahangir and Shahjahan little appears to have happened to disturb the peaceful history of the district. In 1583 A.D. we find Akbar at Kalpi, where he was the guest of the jagirdar Abdul Matlab Khan, and in 1590 the governor was Qasim Ali Khan. Again in 1595 Kalpi was the jagir of Ismael Quli Khan, and in 1605 A.D., the first year of the reign of Jahangir, it was handed over to Khwaja Abdullah Khan. In 1611 Mirza Abdurrahim, Khan Khanan, the son of Bairam Khan, was specially appointed to the districts of Kalpi and Kananj to crush the rebels of the Athgah near Sakit in the latter tract. The only portion of the district that may possibly be reckoned not to have been in actual possession of the Muhammadans was the mahal of Kunch. From the fact that it contained the old Bundela capital of Mau, it appears to have been left in possession of that clan, subject to the payment of revenue, for it is said to have been given in jagir by Raja\nMadhukar Sah to his sixth son, Partap Rao, about 1580 A.D., and it seems to have formed part of the dominions which Jahangir granted to Bir Singh Deo in 1606. After the disastrous flight and death of Jujhar Singh, Bir Singh Deo's successor in the Deccan, Kunch appears to have been assigned in jagir to Champat Rai, but to have been resumed almost immediately from him by Prince Dara and handed over to Pahar Singh, who had been set up as Raja of Orchha. This action drove Champat Rai into the arms of Aurangzeb, whom he materially assisted before the battle of Samugarh, by conducting his army over a ford not held by the enemy. In return for his services he is said to have been given a jagir stretching from \"Orchha to Mol Kanar,\" but he shortly afterwards lost it either by resumption or voluntary resignation because he had taken offence with the emperor.\n\nTowards the end of the seventeenth century, owing to Aurangzeb's long absence in the Deccan after 1682 A.D., rapid disorganisation began to set in among the imperial possessions in this portion of Northern India. Whatever may have been the motives that actuated him\u2014whether it was the desire to resist the emperor's proselytising efforts or the ambition to carve out an extensive empire for himself, cannot now be determined\u2014Chhatarsal, the son of Champat Rai, utilized the opportunity to overrun the parganas to the south and east of Lalitpur, which seem at the time to have been administered from Dhamoni. He even extended his marauding expeditions westward and plundered the imperial caravans on their way to Aurangzeb's camp. Successive commanders were sent against him, but without success; and next Panna, Kalinjar and all the hill forts to the east were reduced, till the whole of the Banda and Hamirpur districts fell into his hands. He next turned his attention to the Jalaun district, ravaged Kunch, Kanar and Kalpi and reduced Orai and Bhadek to ruins. Only Saiyid Latif at Kotra was able to hold out, and even he was ultimately compelled to buy off the freebooting chieftain by the payment of a large sum of money. If sovereignty consisted in the levying of the chauth or similar tribute and the power to ravage and plunder all those who objected to pay, Raja Chhatarsal certainly possessed sovereignty over the Jalaun district. The curtain fell on the disordered scene witnessed during the last 25 years of the reign of Aurangzeb, in 1707 A.D.\nIn that year, when Bahadur Shah succeeded to the throne of Dehli, Chhatarsal was invited to court through the good offices of the Khan Khanan and was confirmed by imperial decree in all the acquisitions he had made; these were estimated to yield a revenue of one million sterling.\n\nOn Farrukhsiyar's accession in 1713 A.D. one of his most trusted officers was Muhammad Khan Ghazansar Jang, better known as the Bangash Nawab of Farrukhabad. He was well acquainted with Bundelkhand, for from 1685 A.D. onwards he had lived the life of an adventurer in the pay of the contending Rajas of Bundelkhand.* Having thrown in his lot with Farrukhsiyar he rendered that emperor valuable service in the battle of Samogar which placed him on the throne of Dehli, was raised to the rank of commander of 4,000, and received the title of Nawab. For the support of his troops he obtained in jagir an extensive tract of country in Bundelkhand comprised in the parganas of Erichh, Bhander, Kalpi, Kunch, Sihonda, Maudaha, Sipri and Jalaun, and appointed his servants to manage them: his chela or pupil, Daler Khan, was posted to Kunch, Sihonda and Maudaha; Ahmad Khan Waraksai to Erichh and Bhander; Pir Khan, his wife's paternal uncle, to Kalpi; and Shujaat Khan Ghilzai to Sipri and Jalaun. The grant was continued by the emperor Muhammad Shah on his accession in 1719 A.D., but disturbances immediately broke out. In 1719-20 the Bundelas plundered Kalpi and killed Pir Khan, Muhammad Khan's amil, having previously overrun Maudaha and Sihonda. Daler Khan was ordered off with a proper force and succeeded in ejecting the thanas of the enemy from the parganas of Kalpi and Jalalpur, but in the course of the following year was defeated and killed near Maudaha by Chhatarsal. Meanwhile the Nawab was appointed subahdar of Allahabad, apparently in addition to his other jagirs, but it was not till 1725 A.D. that he was able to proceed to his estates to restore order. In the course of a rapid campaign during that year he penetrated as far as Sihonda in Banda and succeeded in reinstating his thanas, but immediately on his departure the Bundelas again overran the country. The second campaign undertaken by the Nawab began in January 1727 A.D. and ended disastrously with the surrender of the Nawab after a siege of three\n\n* J. A. S. B., 1878., p. 270 and following.\nmonths in the fort of Jaitpur at the end of August 1729. The Bundelas once more overran the country and took possession of the whole of the Jalau district, while the Nawab was sent as a most unwilling deputy to Malwa, to repel the attacks of a far more powerful foe.\n\nThe immediate cause of the Nawab's defeat at Jaitpur had been the sudden appearance of the Marathas. As early as 1725 A.D. the Peshwa Baji Rao had advanced as far as Malwa and plundered the country. In 1729 the governor of Malwa, Raja Girdhar, fell in an action fought at Tala near Dhar, and left the whole subah in the Peshwa's hands. Muhammad Khan was at this time in the neighbourhood of Jaitpur, conducting negotiations with Chhatarsal for a final settlement of the country, when the latter, urged on by secret letters from the Nawab's enemies at court, basely utilised the opportunity of recovering his defeat by Maratha aid. Whether it was at this time, or a few years later at Chhatarsal's death,* that the compact was made, cannot with accuracy be determined, but the agreement arrived at between the Bundelas and Marathas is generally considered to have provided for the grant to the Peshwa of one-third of the Raja's possessions in Bundelkhand on condition that his successors should be maintained in possession of the rest by Maratha aid. The portion that fell to the lot of the Peshwa comprised Kalpi, Hata, Saugor, Jhansi, Sironj, Kuna, Garhakota and Hardinagar, or all the Bundela possessions lying west of the Dhasan river and south of the Vindhyan scarp beyond the subdivision of Lalitpur, exclusive of those which belonged to the Raja of Orchha, Datia and some other Bundela chiefs. By 1736 A.D. the Marathas had overrun the whole of this country, and six years later had established themselves in secure possession of the district. The headquarters of a Maratha deputy were fixed at Kalpi and Gobind Rao\u2020 was appointed its first governor, but Kunch was given to Holkar and remained in his possession uninterruptedly till 1805 A.D.\n\nThe Bundela remains are singularly few in the district and there is only one Bundela family of any consequence in it. This\n\n* About 1731 A.D.\n\u2020 Also known as Gobind Pandit and Gobind Bundela; the latter appellation he received because he was supposed to have been adopted as a chela by Chhatarsal.\nhowever is not a matter for surprise, for the bulk of the district was dominated in the interest of the Musalmans from Kalpi, and a substantial portion had long been occupied by other Rajput clans such as Sengars and Kachhwahas, who were left by the Mughals in undisturbed possession of their estates. Of the Bundela administration of the district, little is known. Probably it consisted in levying regular contributions of money, or the assignment of tracts of country to various relations or others in jagir, in consideration of the supply of military aid. Their system however differed from that of the emperors; they created much smaller subdivisions, and each large mahal of the Ain-i-Akbari appears to have been split up into two or more parganas of very variable size. The parganas of Kotra, Saiyidnagar, Kharka, Mau Mahoni and Itaura, which are mentioned in the early records, were probably all Bundela formations. The jagirdars and ubaridars of the Bundelas were left to make their own arrangements with the village headmen and resident cultivators. Sometimes, but rarely, village headmen or even strangers held villages in farm for a term. In all villages which were not so given in jagir or farmed, the collection of the revenue was made direct though the headman, who was allowed a certain percentage on the collections called mahtana, shakrana or thumiawat.\n\nGobind Rao was the son of Nur Singh Pandit, and was appointed by the Peshwa, along with his brother Bala Rao, first to the government of the Bundelkhand property bequeathed by Chhatarsal to the Peshwa in Saugor, and subsequently to that of Jalaun and Gursarai. In 1761 A.D. he joined the Maratha army at Panipat, was killed in the battle, and was succeeded in his estates by his son Gangadhar Gobind. Fifteen years later, owing probably to family dissensions, the jurisdiction was divided, and Bala Rao, brother of Gobind Rao, leaving the Jalaun property to the latter's sons, took independent control of Gursarai. Gangadhar Gobind founded the Jalaun state and was succeeded by his son, Gobind Rao, commonly called Nana Gobind Rao. As the connection between the Jalaun and Gursarai families has some subsequent importance in the history of the district, it will be convenient at this point to show the relationship by means of a pedigree.\nMeanwhile hostilities were progressing between the British and the Peshwa in the west of India. The treaty of peace concluded by the Governor General's agent with the Maratha confederates at Puranda on the 1st March 1776 was rendered nugatory through the intrigues of a French agent called the Chevalier St. Lubin and Nana Farnavis, and the war was resumed. In the course of the latter Colonel Cockburn, who commanded the British forces in the pay of the Bombay Government, supporting the claims of Raghunath Rao (Ragoba) to the Poona throne, was hemmed in by the Maratha forces and compelled to sign the disastrous convention of Wargaum. It was at this period that Colonel Goddard was sent by the Bengal Government with a force into Bundelkhand to effect a diversion in favour of the Bombay Government. He took possession of Kalpi and marched through Bundelkhand, and his expedition was so far successful that it enabled the British to conclude a much more favourable treaty with the Maratha confederates at Salbai in 1782. Kalpi was again taken by the British in 1798 but abandoned, and no permanent foothold was made in the country till some years later.\n\nOn December 31st, 1802, was signed the celebrated treaty of Bassein, by which the Peshwa agreed to cede territory of the value of 26 lakhs of rupees for the maintenance of a British force. By a supplemental provision embodied in this treaty on December 16th, 1803, a portion of this territory was exchanged for a part of the Peshwa's possessions in Bundelkhand, where also further transfers...\nfor the support of a force of cavalry were made, amounting in all to land estimated to yield a revenue of over 36 lakhs. At this time Shamsher Bahadur, son Ali Bahadur, the son of the Peshwa Baji Rao, was besieging the fort of Kalinjar, and his ally, Raja Himmat Bahadur Gosain, was with him. The treaty spread great dissatisfaction among the subordinate Maratha chiefs, who formed a plot to resist it: as a result of this the conduct of a predatory excursion into Mirzapur and Benares was assigned to Shamsher Bahadur. Himmat Bahadur however was no Maratha, and saw in the confederacy and its plans only insecurity for himself and his newly-acquired estates in Bundelkhand. He accordingly decided to throw in his lot with the British. Negotiations were conducted with the greatest secrecy through the medium of his trusted agents Colonel Meiselback and Nawab Waji-ud-din Khan, and an agreement concluded at Shahpur 40 miles west of Allahabad on September 4th, 1803, secured to Raja Anupgir Himmat Bahadur an estate equal to his rank and station, estimated to bring in a revenue of 22 lakhs of rupees. On the 6th September a considerable force under Colonel Powell crossed the Jumna at Rajapur and marched to the neighbourhood of Karwi, where it was at once joined by Himmat Bahadur and his troops.\n\nMeanwhile Shamsher Bahadur broke up his camp at Kalinjar and, crossing the Ken, took up his position at Kanwara near Banda. The allies quickly advanced, drove him from the river bank and forced him to an action at Kapsa. He was completely defeated and fled with the remnant of his forces towards Kalpi. Shortly after he expressed a wish to enter into relations with the British Government on the basis of the treaty of cession concluded with the Peshwa, but after fixing a day for the opening of negotiations and delaying for upwards of two months, he prepared once more to contest the British advance. During this interval he had secured the support of Nana Gobind Rao of Jalaun, who threw himself into Kalpi and occupied it. The war was accordingly renewed and Colonel Powell advanced on Kalpi. On the refusal of the commander of the fort to surrender, a battery of two 18-pounders and one howitzer was constructed within 200 yards of the fort. A heavy cannonade began on the morning of December 4th 1803, and continued till 11 A.M., when the garrison yielded and\nmarched out with their arms and property. The only casualties attending its capture were one British officer and one sepoy wounded. The town was immediately occupied by a detachment of British troops \"much to the satisfaction, it is said, of the inhabitants.\"\n\nShortly afterwards Colonel Powell was joined by a brigade of native troops having European officers, under the command of an Englishman named Shepherd, who quitted the service of Ambaji Inglia, and the united forces were occupied, under the direction of Captain John Baillie, agent to the Governor General, in bringing into subjection the interior portions of Bundelkhand. The territories of Nana Gobind Rao, who had opposed the British advance, first engaged the attention of Captain Baillie; and the \"district of Kalpi,\" together with parganas Kotra and Saiyidnagar, were quickly conquered from the Nana, while Kunch was also occupied, and Shamsher Bahadur was induced to tender his allegiance by the promise of a pension of four lakhs.\n\nAnother enemy now began to threaten from the south. A force under Major Shepherd marched to Erichh to oppose the advance of the Pindaris under the noted freebooter Amir Khan,* drove him back to Malthon, and, thinking that he had altogether retired, returned to Banda. Shortly afterwards Amir Khan returned and established himself at Erichh, and engaged in plundering expeditions into the district. In May 1804 a force of seven companies of British troops with a body of artillery was detached by Colonel Fawcett, who commanded in Bundelkhand, to reduce the fort of Amanta Malaya, about five miles from Kunch town. The commander of the fort while offering to surrender and negotiating terms, made overtures to Amir Khan at Erichh, who on the 22nd May marched in person to his assistance. Detaching th Pindaris of his party to plunder the camp, he divided his main body into three parties to attack the force in the trenches. The British troops formed square and drove off the Amir's left wing, which however made its way round between the fort and the bazar and attacked them in the rear, whilst Amir Khan himself charged them in front with the right wing and drove them from their trenches to their camp, with the loss of two howitzers, two twelve-pounders, one six-pounder and all the tumbrils and baggage. The British\n\n* Vide Prinsep's Life of Amir Khan.\nloss was severe and amounted to two companies of native infantry and about 50 European artillerymen. The British force then retreated in safety to Kunch and Amir Khan retired to Erichh. The next day the Pindaris returned towards Kunch, and their leader, hearing of the advance of two companies by way of Kalpi to Kunch, made a forced march to Kalpi, where he arrived by night, and attacked and overpowered the detachment, but subsequently released their leader. Amir Khan then plundered the towns of Kalpi and Ata, but Kunch was saved by the remnants of the force that had been engaged at Malaya. When the Pindaris returned again in June, their forces were entirely broken and dispersed by the British troops under Colonel Shepherd, and did not again trouble the district. They were not however entirely crushed till many years later, and in 1817 the Marquis of Hastings took the field in person against them. The grand army collected to stamp them out was reviewed at Sikandra on the Jumna, and passed through the district from Kalpi to Erichh in that year on its way to Gwalior.\n\nMeanwhile preparations were made to settle matters with Nana Gobind Rao. Further action however was rendered unnecessary by that chief's submission during the course of the year 1804. The ilagas of Orai and Muhammadabad were at once restored to him, and pargana Mahoba was granted to him in the following year. In 1806* a treaty was drawn up between the Governor General's agent at Banda and Nana Gobind Rao, by virtue of which the district of Kalpi was restored to him with the exception of 62 villages in pargana Kalpi and 14 in that of Raipur-Itaura. These, together with the town and fortress of Kalpi, were retained by the British: they formed a strip of country some 50 miles long and on an average three miles broad, along the bank of the Jumna, and secured the control of that stream. The Nana was compensated with 17 villages belonging to pargana Kharka, the whole of pargana Kotra, consisting of 36 villages, and also that of Saiyidnagar containing 14 villages. The Jalaun state thus consisted of pargana Jalaun, the whole of the present tahsil of Orai, and the greater part of pargana Kalpi which was formed into a new pargana called Ata, together with pargana Mahoba in the Hamirpur district containing the\n\n---\n\n*Aitchison's Treaties, II., p. 230 and following.\ntaluqa of Khandeh now in Banda tahsil. Thus the only British possessions remaining in the district after this settlement were 76 villages in Kalpi and the pargana of Kunch containing 92 villages. A word of explanation is necessary as regards the latter. The claims of Holkar on Kunch dated from the invasion of Mulhar Rao Holkar which was checked by Saadat Ali Khan in 1736 A.D. From about 1680 A.D. till that date, it appears to have formed a portion of the state of Datia, probably held as a nominal feof from the Dehli Court. Datia was overrun in 1793 and 1797 by officers of Sindhia, and it was probably on the latter occasion that Raja Ambaji Inglia seized on Kunch. At any rate the latter was in possession of it when the British came to Bundelkhand in 1803, and it was from his service that Colonel Shepherd came over to the British. In 1802 Jaswant Rao Holkar defeated the united forces of Sindhia and the Peshwa near Poona; but the conclusion of the treaty of Bassein defeated his hopes of possessing himself of the person of the Peshwa. In the following years when Sindhia and the Bhonsla combined against the British, Holkar promised to join the confederacy, but on the actual outbreak of hostilities kept aloof, intending to take advantage of the war to aggrandize himself at Sindhia's expense. His schemes however were rendered hopeless by the treaty of Surji Anjangaon, and Holkar after making a series of inadmissible proposals for an alliance seems to have hastily determined, unaided and alone, to provoke hostilities with the British. In the war which followed he was completely defeated, was pursued by Lord Lake across the Sutlej, and on December 24th, 1805,* signed a treaty on the banks of the Bias, by which he was stripped of a large portion of his territories. In the fourth article of the treaty Jaswant Rao Holkar \"renounced all claims to the district of Kunch in the province of Bundelkhand and all claims of every description in that province.\" The British however promised, on condition of the good conduct of Holkar, to give Kunch in jagir at the expiration of two years to Bhima Bai, Holkar's daughter, \"to be holden under the Company's Government on the same terms as that now enjoyed by Balla Bai.\" According to the provisions of this treaty the administration of Kunch was retained in the hands of the collector of Bundelkhand, its revenues being paid to Holkar on behalf of his\n\n* Aitchison's Treaties, III., p. 241.\ndaughter. Kunch stood the house of Holkar in good stead for many years. The anarchy and confusion which prevailed in their territories previous to the treaty of Mandisor in 1818 ruined their finances. The minister, Tantia Jog, at length effected their recovery with the aid of loans from the British Government secured in part by lien on the Kunch jagir.\n\nAfter 1804 nothing occurred for fifty years to disturb the peace of the tract. Gobind Rao concluded another treaty* in 1817 with the British, by which he transferred to the latter 44 villages \"comprising the ilaga of Khandeh\" and four villages \"belonging to the pargana of Churkhi\" on the banks of the Jumna, in consideration of the fact that the British Government relinquished forever its rights to tribute and military service from the Nana, his heirs and successors. He died in 1822 and was succeeded by his own son, Bala Rao Gobind. The latter died childless in 1832 and his widow, Lachhmi Bai, was permitted to adopt her brother Gobind Rao. The principality thus passed to a child only six years of age, who was placed under the guardianship of Lachhmi Bai. The regent herself however was but a child,* being at the time not more than thirteen or fourteen years of age, and proved quite unequal to the duty of controlling the district. A strong party was formed adverse to her authority; the country became disorganized; the government was involved in debt; and portion after portion of the territory was mortgaged, until at length the regent and her minister applied to the political agent for a loan, declaring their inability to carry on the government without it and exhibiting a statement of revenues and expenses which showed an annual deficit of 2\u00bd lakhs of rupees. Accordingly in 1838 the British Government assumed the temporary management of the country; Captain Doolan was appointed administrator and made Orai his headquarters. Two years later, in 1842, the infant chief died during minority; and no one surviving of the family of Nana Gobind Rao entitled to claim the succession under the engagement by which that chief was constituted hereditary ruler of the country, the state lapsed to the British Government. Liberal pensions to the aggregate amount of Rs. 70,000 a year were settled on the retainers and followers of the Jalaun family. The lapsed territories formed the nucleus of the Jalaun district. The\n\n* Aitchison's Treaties, II., p. 239.\nsuccessive steps by which it came to assume its present proportions have already been detailed in chapter IV, and need not be here recapitulated. The changes introduced were steps of administration peacefully carried out, and nothing occurred to interrupt the quiet progress of the district under British rule till 1857.\n\nThe troops cantoned at Orai in the fateful year 1857 consisted of two companies of the 53rd Bengal Native Infantry, but they were about to be relieved by a detachment of the 56th Bengal Native Infantry from Cawnpore, a regiment regarding which the gravest suspicions were abroad. The civil staff of the district consisted of Captain Browne, deputy commissioner; Messrs. Passanah and Griffiths, deputy collectors; Lieutenant Lamb, assistant commissioner and several other Europeans serving in subordinate capacities. On June 6th the officer in command of the troops received an express, stating that the artillery and some of the infantry at Jhansi had mutinied and seized the Star Fort. Captain Browne thereupon at once sent off the bulk of his treasure, amounting to 4\u00bd lakhs of rupees, to Gwalior, under the guard of Lieutenant Tomkinson and 100 men of the 53rd regiment; called in two companies of the 1st Gwalior regiment from Etawah, which, together with some Maratha horse, reached Orai at 1 A.M. on the 7th June; and directed the officer commanding the two companies of the 56th Bengal Native Infantry to retrace his steps to Cawnpore immediately. The latter accordingly returned to Kalpi the same night. At the same time the deputy commissioner received intelligence of the outbreak at Cawnpore and was brought a note from Sheo Pershad, deputy collector at Kalpi, in which that officer expressed a desire to desert his post. As Kalpi was a most important point of communication over the Jumna it was of the greatest importance to hold it, and Lieutenant Lamb, assistant commissioner, volunteering to go there, Captain Browne sent him, and at the same time despatched a message to the brigadier at Gwalior to send aid to Jhansi.\n\nOn the arrival of Captain Cosseratt's detachment from Etawah Captain Browne resolved to proceed with it and some Samthar troops and guns to the relief of the Europeans at Jhansi, leaving the police at Orai; but on the 9th a letter was received from Moth, stating that all the Europeans at Jhansi had been massacred, and Captain Browne gave up his intention of going to Jhansi. The same day\nthe men of the 53rd Infantry, remaining at Orai, deserted their officers; the barkandazes of the customs department mutinied, and Captain Cosseratt, who was at Kunch, received orders from his commanding officer to return to Etawah. A letter was now received from the Raja of Gursarai offering aid, and on the 10th instant his two sons arrived at Jalaun with a force of several hundred men and a few guns. On the same day Captain Browne and Lieutenant Lamb also proceeded to that place. Here the former having met the sons and assured himself of their good intentions, addressed a letter to their father, requesting him to afford every assistance in preserving order in the district. Captain Browne, Lieutenant Lamb and Captain Cosseratt's party left Jalaun on the 11th or 12th June and next day parwanas were addressed in the name of the Gursarai chief to the different tahsildars of the district, stating that the management of affairs was entrusted to him, and that all reports should be sent to him. On the tahsildar of Jalaun referring the matter to Captain Browne, that officer passed an order that the jagirdar was not to have control of the district, but was to remain under Mr. Passanah, deputy collector, who elected to remain at Orai. A copy of this order was sent to Mr. Passanah by Captain Browne, who also stated that some words had been interpolated in his vernacular letter to the Gursarai chief. After this Captain Browne left the district, and proceeded with his assistant Lieutenant Lamb to Etawah, having ascertained on the way that tahsil Kachhwahagarh and the northern part of Jalaun had become quite disorganized. Messrs. Passanah and Griffiths remained at Orai.\n\nOn 15th June the advance guard of the Jhansi mutineers, who had left that place for Cawnpore, reached Orai. Messrs. Passanah and Griffiths left the place during the night and passed through Jalaun, where they met Sheo Ram Tantia, eldest son of the Gursarai chief, who shortly after assumed entire authority over the Jalaun district. Mr. Passanah's mother, unable to bear the fatigues of the road, was left behind at Orai, where she was cruelly murdered on 17th June; while Mr. Heming, the sub-assistant surgeon, after wandering distractedly about in the direction of Kalpi and returning to Orai, was discovered and put to death at the same time. The rest of the Europeans in the station, consisting of\nMr. Double, head clerk of the office, his wife, his small daughter and son, and his mother-in-law, disguised as natives, sought concealment in the ravines of the village of Kharka. They were however discovered by some Muhammadans and betrayed. On the requisition of the Jhansi mutineers a party was sent out by the Gursarai chief's son to bring them in and they were handed over to the mutineers, who took them to within three miles of Kalpi and then released them. The whole party wandered off the road and after a short time perished of exposure and privation, with the exception of the infant son of Mr. Double, who was picked by a villager, brought to Kalpi, and ultimately taken in safety to Jhansi by a woman servant.\n\nFrom Jalaun Messrs. Passanah and Griffiths made in the direction of Gwalior; but on the 17th June fell in with the 100 men of the 53rd Infantry, who were returning from Gwalior, after having faithfully escorted the district treasure thither. These men had now mutinied; they plundered the two gentlemen, made them prisoners and marched to Jalaun, where they were received with great cordiality by Sheo Ram Tantia. The latter made over to them Rs. 1,400 from the Government treasury and bought Messrs. Passanah and Griffith's property from them. From Jalaun the two officers were taken to Orai, where they were released by the mutineers on 21st June, the latter marching on to Cawnpore. They were however detained by a guard belonging to the Gursarai chief, and the headman made them over to the mutineers of the Gwalior contingent and the 14th Irregular Cavalry from Lalitpur, who reached Orai the same day. These mutineers however did not molest them and let them go. The two gentlemen then remained at Orai and Kesho Rao, chief of Gursarai, coming in person to Jalaun, sent them a kind letter and some money. Kesho Rao now took upon himself the whole government of the country save Kachhwahagarh, which was occupied by Sindhia, and Duboh, which was taken possession of by the Datia State, collected revenue, gave villages in jagir for military service, and established a mint. He at the same time wrote letters to the commissioner of Jabalpur, stating that Captain Browne had made him over the district to take care of for the British.\n\nMessrs. Passanah and Griffiths remained about three weeks at Orai unmolested, but on 14th July a few mutineers who had\nreached Orai and heard that they were living there made a threatening attack on them, which was beaten off by some well-disposed inhabitants of the town. On 17th July Mr. Passanah received a letter from Kesho Rao stating that a force of the Nana's was about to proceed from Cawnpore to Jhansi, and advising him to keep out of the way; but the same day a party in the employ of Sheo Ram Tantia, the chief's son, who was at Kalpi, seized both gentlemen and Mr. Passanah's family, put them into two carts and took them all to Kalpi, to be forwarded to the Nana at Cawnpore. On the way they met Sheo Ram Tantia who would pay no heed to their remonstrances, and said that he must obey the Nana's orders. They were kept prisoners at Kalpi till Sheo Ram's return, who then ordered them to be taken to the Nana; but on the 19th July, intelligence of the Nana's defeat and flight from Cawnpore reached Kalpi and Sheo Ram Tantia completely changed his tone. He affected great kindness towards his prisoners, Kesho Rao himself came over from Jalaun to visit them, and when the mutineers of the 42nd regiment reached Kalpi from Saugor and wished to get hold of the two gentlemen and their families, Sheo Ram Tantia placed them in the fort and protected them. As soon as the mutineers had gone, he had them conveyed to Churkhi, 15 miles from Kalpi. Mr. Passanah now found means of communicating with General Neill at Cawnpore, and the General wrote to Sheo Ram Tantia to send the party to him; but the latter postponed their despatch on the ground of the dangers of the road. At last General Neill became peremptory, and, the Nana having been defeated at Bithur, Kesho Rao furnished them with money and carriages, restored to them their two horses and had the whole party conveyed in safety to Cawnpore on 2nd September 1857.\n\nThe Gursarai chief was now left undisputed master of the whole Jalaun district, with the exception of parganas Kachhwahagarh and Duboh, and he and his family fixed their headquarters at Jalaun, while retaining our district establishments. On the 19th October Kuar Singh of Jagdispur, with the mutineers of the 40th Bengal Native Infantry, arrived at Kalpi, and Tantia Topi at the head of Sindhia's troops, who mutinied at Gwalior on 22nd September after the fall of Delhi, moved in the direction of Jalaun. The latter reached Jalaun on 29th October and was received by the Gursarai chief, who\nhad no power to resist him and prepared to treat for the possession of the district. Another claimant however arose in the person of Tai Bai,* and Tantia Topi, favouring her cause, deposed Kesho Rao and placed the infant son of Tai Bai on the Jalaun gaddi, with one Biswas Rao as manager, on condition that she acknowledged the Nana and paid up a sum of three lakhs. Tantia Topi was in communication with Kuar Singh at Kalpi, and Kesho Rao and his sons were seized, thrown into prison, plundered of all they possessed and subjected to severe bodily chastisement, while Sheo Ram Tantia at Kalpi was on the 3rd of November also imprisoned. On the 7th of November Kuar Sing and Tantia Topi joined forces and an advance was made on Cawnpore, while a small force and the magazine were left at Kalpi under Bala Rao, the Nana's brother.\n\nAfter the defeat of the rebel forces at Cawnpore and again at Sheorajpur, Tantia Topi was sent to Kalpi to take charge of the force and magazine left there, and on his departure for Charkhari, the Nana's nephew, Rao Sahib, took up his residence at Kalpi and made it his headquarters, accumulating artillery and warlike stores. After Tantia's defeat near Jhansi, on 1st April 1858, the rebel forces fled to Kalpi, where they were joined soon after by that leader himself, who had effected his escape via Bhandar and Kunch, and by the Rani of Jhansi, who evacuated her fortress on the 5th.\n\nKalpi now became a fortress of first-class importance, and as its occupation would enable Sir Hugh Rose to touch the left rear of Sir Colin Campbell's army, its capture was a matter of urgent necessity. After seventeen days halt at Jhansi Sir Hugh Rose, having detached Major Orr and the Hyderabad Contingent to prevent any rebels crossing the Betwa on the east, moved forward on the 25th April. Meanwhile the bold Rani of Jhansi had persuaded the Rao Sahib to give her his army to oppose the British advance. Accordingly all the troops, consisting of some regiments of the Gwalior contingent, several regiments of the regular native infantry recruited to nearly full strength, the contingents of various rebel Rajas and the remnant of the Jhansi garrison were paraded by the Rao Sahib, who addressed them, and despatched them under Tantia Topi to try once more their fortune with the British forces. Tantia Topi marched to Kunch and took up a strong position, covered by\n\n* She was a granddaughter of Bala Rao, brother of Gobind Rao Pandit.\nwoods and gardens, with temples at intervals between each of them, surrounded by a strong wall, and there threw up intrenchments. Major Gall, with the advance guard of the British army, harassed incessantly by the enemy, reached Punchh on May 1st, where he was joined by Sir Hugh Rose the same day. Major Orr meanwhile, on his side, had crossed the Betwa, attacked the rebel Rajas of Banpur and Shahgarh at Kotra, and taken one of their guns. He had however found it impossible to cut them off and they had succeeded, for the time, in escaping southwards, supplies and carriage being furnished by the treacherous Raja of Jigni. By Sir Hugh's direction Major Orr then marched on Kunch.\n\nOn May 5th Sir Hugh Rose was joined by his second brigade, strengthened by the 71st Highlanders, and at once advanced on Lohari, four miles from Kunch, where the fort was easily captured by a detachment under Major Gall. Early on the morning of the 6th he broke up his encampment near Lohari and marched to a position facing the unfortified side of the town of Kunch, with the intention of making a flank attack on the enemy's position and cutting off their line of retreat to Kalpi. His first brigade, forming his left, rested on the village of Nagupura; his second brigade, forming the centre, occupied that of Chumer; and Major Orr's Hyderabad force, forming the right, occupied the village of Umri, the whole position being two miles from Kunch. The action opened on the morning of the 7th by a cannonade designed to cover the clearing of the woods and outworks lying between the British position and the town. This operation was carried out by the first brigade, who steadily advanced in the teeth of a heavy fire of artillery and musketry and captured the fort. The success threatened the flank of the rebels posted on the right and they gave way; and the whole body rallied on the Kalpi road and commenced an orderly retreat. The terrific heat of the day had had a severe effect on the British infantry, and the cavalry took up the pursuit. But so admirable were the dispositions of the enemy that it was not for a long time that the rear guard was driven back on the main body. The retreat then became a rout, and the rebels, with the loss of all their guns, fled promiscuously along the road to Kalpi, pursued by the British till the latter from sheer fatigue were compelled to desist. Tantia Topi and the Rani of Jhansi early made good\ntheir escape; while recriminations broke out among the rebels, the infantry complaining that they had been abandoned by the cavalry, and all arms bringing the same accusation against Tantia Topi. To such an extent did the animosities among the several parties proceed that on the morrow of their reaching Kalpi the rumour that Sir Hugh Rose was advancing by forced marches against that place sufficed to induce them to disperse. Sir Hugh Rose pushed on with all speed to Kalpi and on the 15th May he established himself at Gulauli on the Jumna, six miles west of the fortress. He had received intelligence that a detachment had been sent to co-operate with him and was encamped opposite this place on the north bank of the river.\n\nMeanwhile the discomfited sepoys of the rebel army, exhorted by their leaders to hold their arsenal to the last, plucked up courage and reassembled. Their previous despair was converted to elation by the unexpected arrival of the Nawab of Banda with 2,000 horse, some guns and many followers, the remnant of the force defeated by General Whitlock near Banda. Entrenchments were rapidly thrown up in the intricate ravines that surround the town, and a second line of defence was prepared in the direction of the chaurasi gumbaz. On the 16th, 17th, 18th, 19th and 20th constant skirmishes occurred between the two armies, the enemy being the attacking party. On all these occasions they were repulsed, but the British suffered much from the sun and the incessant anxiety. On the 19th a mortar battery was established on the right front of the British position and opened on the town. On the 21st the batteries from Colonel Maxwell's camp, which crossed the Jumna on the previous day and joined Sir Hugh Rose, also commenced a cannonade; and on the 22nd the General resolved to deliver his final blow. This consisted of an attack on the left face of the fort, whilst Maxwell's batteries shelled Kalpi from the right.\n\nMeanwhile the rebels themselves had prepared a skilful plan of attack, and had determined that, whilst their right made a great demonstration on the British left, their main body should steal up the ravines and try to overwhelm the right, weakened, as they hoped, by detachments sent to support the left. Of this plan Sir Hugh Rose received information and made his dispositions accordingly. At\n10 o'clock on May 22nd the rebels marched out in masses along the Banda road, and threatened the British left, opening fire simultaneously with their guns on the centre. This attack, headed by the Nawab of Banda and the Rao Sahib, though intended only as a feint, developed into a severe struggle and the British left became heavily engaged. No support however was sent to it from the right. It was fortunate that the General adhered to his determination to maintain his strength in this direction, for, in pursuance of their plan, the enemy suddenly swarmed up the ravines and poured in an overwhelming fire of musketry on the British troops. The British troops, prostrated by the heat and with many of their weapons rendered almost ineffective by continued use, made but a feeble reply, and the whole line was being slowly driven back on the battery and light field guns, pressed by yelling masses of the enemy, when the opportune arrival of the camel corps, who dismounted and charged the foe, turned the fortune of the day. The victory was one of the most important and dearly bought in the annals of the Mutiny. The enemy evacuated the fort during the night and fled.\n\nWhile Sir Hugh Rose advanced to Kalpi, Captain Ternan took over charge of the Jalaun district at Kunch, where 300 men of the Gursarai chief's forces were cantoned. Tai Bai and her followers came in and submitted to Captain Ternan and to Sir Robert Hamilton, agent to the Governor-General, at Orai on May 10th, and Jalaun was occupied by some friendly Rajputs. Disturbances however soon broke out again in Kunch, headed by Barjor Singh, a rebel Rajput. On May 31st Major Orr with the Hyderabad contingent, who had been sent to come to terms with him, surprised Barjor Singh at Bilawan, killed about 150 of his armed followers, took all his baggage and dispersed his band. The revolution in Gwalior however had a ruinous effect on the rebels, and practically the whole of the district fell once more into their hands; they were headed by Barjor Singh and Daulat Singh.\n\n\"The enemy had erected houses and tents in the fort, had their smiths' shops, their carpenters' shops, their foundries for casting shot and shell in perfect order, clean and well constructed: the specimens of brass shells cast by them were faultless. In the arsenal were about 60,000 pounds of gunpowder: outside it were large heaps of shot and shell ranged after the fashion of our own. It would appear that the enemy had prepared for a long stand here.\"\u2014Lowe's Central India.\nTowards the end of July these rebel bands began to close round Jalaun and, turning their attention once more to Kunch, drove out the Gursarai chief's men and captured two guns. On the 2nd August they took Jalaun, but hearing that a party of troops was approaching from Kalpi abandoned it the following day, after deliberately killing the thanadar. The Kalpi force now remained at Jalaun; and in the middle of the month a strong detachment was sent under Captain Ashburner to act against Barjor Singh and co-operate with the force at Jalaun. On September 4th Captain Ashburner attacked and drove Barjor Singh out of Mau Mahoni, killed 40 of his men and took his two guns and all his ammunition; and on the next day Brigadier McDuff, who had moved out of Kalpi, attacked and defeated a large body of rebels and mutineers at Sarawan, 10 miles north of Jalaun, killing about 150 and taking one gun. Captain Ashburner subsequently entered Kachhwahagarh and his and Brigadier McDuff's forces effectually broke up for a time the bands of rebels in the Jalaun district. It was not however till Tantia Topi had been finally defeated that the Kalpi force was able to take the field without anxiety for their base of operations and clear the western parganas of Barjor Singh, Daulat Singh and the Raja of Bhadek, together with their marauders. When these rebel leaders had been disposed of there was little trouble in effecting the complete restoration of order, for one peculiarity of the rebellion in Jalaun was that the inhabitants remained generally peaceful in spite of the mutineer bands that continually harassed and marched through it.\n\nNothing has since occurred to disturb its peace, and the history of the administrative changes, famines and other events that have taken place has been already given in the preceding pages.\n## GAZETTEER OF JALAUH.\n\n### DIRECTORY\n\n#### CONTENTS\n\n| Page | Page |\n|------|------|\n| Ait  | 145  |\n| Akbarpur | 145 |\n| Amkhem | 146 |\n| Ata   | 146 |\n| Babina | 147 |\n| Bangra | 147 |\n| Bhadek | 148 |\n| Bhuwa | 148 |\n| Churkhi | 148 |\n| Girthan | 148 |\n| Gopalpur | 149 |\n| Hadrukh | 149 |\n| Ingol | 149 |\n| Itaura | 150 |\n| Jagumanpur | 150 |\n| Jakholi | 150 |\n| Jalun | 151 |\n| Jalun Tahsil | 152 |\n| Kailia Hamirpur | 157 |\n| Kalpi | 157 |\n| Kalpi Tahsil | 163 |\n| Kanar | 170 |\n| Kanjaua | 170 |\n| Khaksia | 170 |\n| Kotra | 171 |\n| Kunch | 171 |\n| Kunch Tahsil | 174 |\n| Kusamilia | 180 |\n| Kuthaund | 180 |\n| Madhogarh | 180 |\n| Mau | 181 |\n| Mohana | 182 |\n| Muhammadabad | 182 |\n| Orai | 183 |\n| Orai Tahsil | 184 |\n| Parasam | 188 |\n| Parawar | 188 |\n| Pirona | 189 |\n| Raipur | 189 |\n| Rampura | 189 |\n| Rendhar | 190 |\n| Saiyidnagar | 190 |\n| Saliya Buzurg | 191 |\n| Sunaya | 191 |\n| Umri | 191 |\n| Usargaon | 192 |\nDIRECTORY.\n\nAIT, Tahsil Orai.\n\nA large village lying in 25\u00b0 53' N. and 79\u00b0 16' E., on the Cawnpore-Jhansi trunk road. It is 15 miles south-west of Orai; and is connected with Kunch to the north-west by a metalled road, and with Kotra to the south-east by a second class unmetalled road. Close to the village is a railway station on the Jhansi-Cawnpore section of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, and a branch line constructed in 1903 takes off at Ait and runs to Kunch, distant nine miles. Near the station is a large cotton ginning factory belonging to Messrs. Ram Nath and Baij Nath of Cawnpore, and a considerable amount of trade in agricultural produce is carried on by means of the railway. The village had in 1901 a population of 1,918 souls, chiefly consisting of Brahmans, Kurmis, Banias and Musalmans; and a weekly bazar is held on Thursdays. The village contains a police station, a pound, a school and a post-office; and close by are the ruins of an old fort. There is also an inspection bungalow under the control of the Public Works department.\n\nAKBARPUR, Tahsil Kalpi.\n\nA considerable village lying in 26\u00b0 2' N. and 79\u00b0 43' E. It combines with its neighbour Itaura to form one village having a total area of 2,289 acres, and is distant 8 miles due south of Kalpi and 16 miles north-east of Orai. From Ata, with which, as also with Kalpi and Parasan, it is connected by unmetalled sixth-class roads, it is distant six miles. The population in 1901 numbered 2,625 persons, chiefly consisting of Brahmans, Rajputs, Kachhis, Chamars and Ahirs, but the proprietary right in both estates belongs to a Maratha Brahman. The village contains a branch post-office, a pound and a school; and is the site of a large fair held on the 5th day of the light half of Kartik in honour of Guru Rupan Baba; it lasts about a fortnight and is attended by some 4,500 people. A temple dedicated to the Guru is situated close by on the side of a considerable tank. Rupan Baba was born in the time of Akbar and is said to have possessed supernatural powers. He is reported\nto have started a new religion under the name of Niranjani, and\nthe emperor in estimation of his character is said to have built\nboth tank and temple to his memory. The refounding and renam-\ning of Itaura as Akbarpur is also attributed to the same monarch.\nMarket is held daily in Itaura, and the place is well stocked with\nexcellent masonry houses. In the middle of the 19th century it was\na famous mart for salt and the residence of some wealthy mahajans,\nbut the trade was ruined by the establishment of the customs pre-\nventive line.\n\nAMKHERA, Tahsil Jalaun.\nA village lying in 26\u00b0 12' N. and 79\u00b0 17' E., eight miles\nnorth-west of Jalaun on the unmetalled road to Madhogarh.\nIn 1901 it had a total population of 1,163 persons, and it\ncontains a school attended by some 25 pupils. Market is held\nweekly on Tuesdays and Saturdays, and formerly the place was\none of considerable importance as a trade centre. After the estab-\nlishment of the customs line, which ran to the east of it, it was greatly\nfostered at the expense of Kunch, and attracted to itself a large\ntrade in cotton, gur and salt, while between the months of Jeth\nand Kuar a brisk business used to be done in cattle. Most of the\ntrade, however, has now been directed to the bigger marts at Madho-\ngarh and Jalaun. The inhabitants are for the most part Chamars.\n\nATA, Tahsil Kalpi.\nA large village lying in 26\u00b0 3' N. and 79\u00b0 37' E., on the\nCawnpore-Jhansi trunk road, distant 11 miles from Kalpi and the\nsame from Orai. The total area of the village is 3,399 acres\nand it is owned by a large community of Brahmans, who with\nKachhis, Koris and Chamars form the bulk of the inhabitants.\nA metalled road connects it with Amisa on the unmetalled road\nwhich passes over the Betwa to Rath in Hamirpur, and unmetalled\nroads run to Jalaun and Itaura. The village is the birthplace\nof one Bamdeo Muni, and a temple of Mahabir is situated\nat the spot where he used to perform religious exercises; but\nthis is now in ruins. The site contains a sarai which has\nfallen into decay owing to the disuse of the road by travellers.\nAta contains a second class police station, a post office, a pound,\na school, and a military encamping-ground, and close by is a\nrailway station on the Jhansi-Cawnpore section of the Great Indian Peninsula railway. A bazar is held twice a week on Mondays and Fridays. Formerly Ata was a place of some importance and gave its name both to a pargana and tahsil, when the tract was in the hands of the subahdars of Jalaun. When however it lapsed to the British, Kalpi at once became the headquarters and Ata ceased soon after even to give its name to the tahsil. The population in 1901 numbered 2,003 souls.\n\nBABINA, Tahsil Kalpi.\n\nA large and important village, lying in $26^\\circ 1' N.$ and $79^\\circ 50' E.$, in a peninsula of territory, almost completely surrounded by land belonging to the Nawab of Baoni. It is situated in the extreme east of the district, 10 miles distant from Kalpi and 24 miles from Orai. It is connected with Kalpi by an unmetalled road, which branches off from the Kalpi-Jalalpur second-class road, and by other unmetalled roads with Ata and Orai and with Kurara in Hamirpur. The total area of the village is 4,395 acres, and it had in 1901 a population of 1,963 persons, chiefly consisting of Rajputs, Brahmans, Chamars, Kachhis, Telis and Ahirs. The village contains a police outpost, occupied by three constables and a head constable, a pound and a school, and is said to have derived its name from one Balmik Rishi, who was born here and subsequently migrated to Bithur. Kudaura, the capital of the Baoni state, is only two miles distant.\n\nBANGRA, Tahsil Kunch.\n\nA village lying in $26^\\circ 12' N.$ and $79^\\circ 13' E.$, on the borders of tahsil Jalaun. It is distant 11 miles west of Jalaun and six miles south of Madhogarh, and is situated on the metalled road which connects Madhogarh and Jalaun via Bangra: a second-class road runs south to Kunch, and others to Rendhar and Gopalpur. The village is owned by a prosperous body of Kachhwaha Rajputs and Gujars, and has a total population of 2,263 persons, chiefly Rajputs, Gujars and Brahmans. It contains a pound, a post-office and a school; and a police outpost, occupied by one head and three constables, has now taken the place of the police station which was formerly located in it. The Kuthaund branch of the Betwa canal runs past the village a little to the east of the site.\nBHADEK, Tahsil Jalaun.\n\nA considerable village lying in $26^\\circ 23' \\text{ N.}$ and $79^\\circ 30' \\text{ E.}$, on the banks of the Jumna river, six miles north-east of Kuthaund and 34 miles from Orai via Jalaun and the metalled road to Shergarh ghat. The village is situated amid ravines in a somewhat isolated position and in 1901 contained a population of 1,192 persons, the principal Hindu caste being Brahmans. There is a small primary school in the village. Bhadek is at the present day a place of no importance, but in the time of Akbar it was the head-quarters of a mahal in the sarkar of Kalpi. Later it was the seat of a small Hindu principality of Sengar Rajputs connected with the Raja of Jagamanpur; but the last chieftain, Raja Parichhat, turned rebel at the Mutiny; his estate was confiscated, and the village of Bhadek was purchased by a Brahman jagirdar who now resides in it. There are two small ruined garhis or forts, which formerly belonged to the Raja, but no history attaches to them.\n\nBUWA, Tahsil Orai.\n\nA small village lying six miles south-west of Orai in $25^\\circ 57' \\text{ N.}$ and $79^\\circ 22' \\text{ E.}$. It is situated in the centre of a fertile tract of mar soil, and has a population of 302 persons. Close to the village is a station of the same name on the Jhansi-Cawnpore section of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, which is connected by a metalled approach road, 6 furlongs long, with the Jhansi-Cawnpore trunk road.\n\nCHURKHI, Tahsil Kalpi.\n\nA large village in $26^\\circ 9' \\text{ N.}$ and $79^\\circ 34' \\text{ E.}$, 14 miles west of Kalpi and 13 miles north-east of Orai. The village had in 1901 a total population of 1,701 persons, mainly consisting of Rajputs, Brahmans, Kachhis and Chamars, and contains a second-class police station, a school, a pound and a post-office. The site lies in the centre of a somewhat broken tract of country not far from the Non river. It was formerly a place of some importance and is connected by unmetalled roads with Orai, Ata, Hadrukh and Nipania. Near the village are the ruins of a small fort.\n\nGIRTHAN, Tahsil Orai.\n\nA large village in $25^\\circ 55' \\text{ N.}$ and $79^\\circ 20' \\text{ E.}$, close to the Jhansi-Cawnpore trunk road, nine miles south-west of Orai. The\nvillage had in 1901 a population of only 274 persons, and is much decayed. It was formerly owned by Rajputs, many of whose shares have been alienated to Marwari and Maratha money-lenders. The village has a military encamping-ground and the ruins of an old fort, which is occupied by the zamindars.\n\nGOPALPUR, Tahsil Kunch.\n\nThe capital of the small jagir of the same name lies in $26^\\circ 15'$ N. and $79^\\circ 8'$ E., twenty-nine miles north-west of Orai: an unmetalled road runs from it to Bangra, where it joins the metalled road to the head-quarters of the district. The town contains a population of 2,505 persons, and is the residence of Rao Sheo Darshan Singh, a Kachhwaha Rajput, who owns the jagir, of which an account has been given in chapter III. There are a police station maintained by the Rao, a school and a post-office. Besides the Rao's residence, the site contains a remarkable masonry well which is full of water during the day, to within a foot or two of the brim, and at night overflows it. This is situated on the high banks of the Pahuj, and the overflowing water descends into that stream about a hundred feet below. An annual fair is held in honour of the well, which is said to owe its wonderful properties to the blessing of a good jagir named Mast Ram Baba.\n\nHADRUKE, Tahsil Jalaun.\n\nA large village lying in $26^\\circ 16'$ N. and $79^\\circ 25'$ E., on the metalled road from Jalaun to Shergarh ghat: it is nine miles north of Jalaun, and is connected by one unmetalled road with Ata, and by another with Madhogarh vid Sarawan and Amkhera. The population in 1901 numbered 1,596 persons and mainly consisted of Songar Rajputs, Brahmans, Kachhis and Chamars. The village contains a military encamping-ground, a canal inspection house, a second-class police station, a pound, a school and a post-office, and the village lands are watered by a distributary from the Kuthaund branch of the Betwa canal.\n\nINGOI, Tahsil Kunch.\n\nA village lying in $25^\\circ 51'$ N. and $79^\\circ 9'$ E., on the extreme southern boundary of the tahsil. It is situated close to the Jhansi-\nCawnpore trunk road, at a distance of 23 miles from Orai, and is connected by an unmetalled road with Kunch on the north, while the Betwa river flows about three miles to the south. The village is an insignificant one, and had a population in 1901 of only 16 persons, the zamindars being Rajputs living in Pirona about a mile and a half to the north-east. It contains an old fort, which is now nazul property, and has a police outpost of one head constable and three constables. Pirona railway station lies a mile to the north, and the Hamirpur branch of the Betwa canal passes through the village lands.\n\n**ITAU RA, Tahsil Kalpi.**\n\n*(Vide Akbarpur.)*\n\n**JAGAMANPUR, Tahsil Jalaun.**\n\nThe capital of the jagir of the same name lies in 26\u00b0 25' N. and 79\u00b0 15' E., not far from the junction of the Sindh river with the Jumna in the extreme north-west of the district. It is distant 32 miles from Orai and 19 miles from Jalaun, with the latter of which it is connected by an unmetalled road; it is also connected with Madhogarh by an unmetalled road via Rampura. The place is the residence of Raja Rup Sah, a Sengar Rajput of whom and of whose estate some account has been given in chapter III. The Raja is an honorary magistrate, exercising 3rd class powers, and is also allowed to keep two cannon: he pays a perpetual quit-rent of Rs. 4,754. The town contains a large masonry fort, a school, a third-class police station and a post-office, and had in 1901 a population of 2,991 persons. A weekly bazar is held on Thursdays and Sundays.\n\n**JAKHOLI, Tahsil Kunch.**\n\nA small village lying in 25\u00b0 52' N. and 79\u00b0 12' E., on the Jhansi-Cawnpore trunk road, 19 miles south-west of Orai. The Hamirpur branch of the Betwa canal passes close to the village. The population in 1901 numbered 589 persons, chiefly consisting of Kurmis and Brahmans. The village contains a dilapidated fort, which is nazul property, a Government encamping-ground and a small private school.\nJALAUN, Tahsil Jalaun.\n\nThe headquarters town of the tahsil of the same name lies in $26^\\circ 8' N.$ and $79^\\circ 21' E.$ It is connected with Orai, the district headquarters, by a metalled road 13 miles long; other metalled roads run to Madhogarh via Bangra and to Shergarh-ghat, and unmetalled roads lead to Kunch, 15 miles to the south, to Ata, 19 miles on the east and to Rampura, 19 miles, and Sarsai, 12 miles, to the north-east.\n\nThe town, which is very centrally situated, has always given its name to the district. It is of considerable size and contains a fair proportion of masonry houses. The central roadway, that from Orai, first passes to the tahsili and then passes round the ruins of the fort on either side to reach the Deoti Bazar, formerly the principal business-place of the town. The brickbuilt or brickfaced houses that line it are few in number, and mudbuilt houses greatly predominate, while many parts of the town present the appearance of an ordinary village, inhabited solely by agriculturists. The fort was the residence of the subahdars of Jalaun till 1840; it was demolished in 1860 by the British, and has now practically disappeared. The old sarai, which was never a place of large resort, has been now abandoned. The trade of the place, which was once considerable, subsequently decayed, but it has of recent years somewhat revived, being in part fostered by the construction of a large ganj or market-place built in 1881 and named Whiteganj after the late Mr. P. J. White, for many years collector and settlement officer of Jalaun. Besides the tahsili the town contains a first class police-station, a dispensary, a flourishing school, a post-office, a pound, a district bungalow and a military encamping-ground. It lies generally on low ground and is liable to be surrounded by swamps in the rains. The site, however, has recently been improved by drainage works. Around it, at some distance outside, there is a circular road, known as the chakr, which is annually repaired by the district board.\n\nJalaun has been administered under Act XX of 1856 since the year 1860, and has an annual income and expenditure of approximately Rs. 3,500; the bulk of the former being derived from the proceeds of the chaukidari tax and from weighmen's fees. In 1865 the population numbered 14,242 souls; from that year till 1891 there was a steady decline, for in 1872 there were 10,197 persons, in 1881\nonly 10,057, and in 1891 only 8,159. At the last enumeration in 1901 the inhabitants were found to number 8,573, out of which 7,117 were Hindus and 1,448 Musalmans. The wealthier and more respectable inhabitants are Maratha Brahmans, whose ancestors held employment under the Peshwa's deputy and who are now either pensioners or in the enjoyment of revenue-free grants; many, however, have emigrated to Gwalior. Since the revival of trade, a number of Marwari bankers have come to reside in the town, and an out-agency has been started by the railway.\n\nIt was proposed in 1858 to remove the headquarters of the district to Jalaun, but the plan was abandoned partly owing to the unhealthiness of its situation, and partly on account of the more convenient situation of Orai on the Jhansi-Cawnpore trunk road. The trade of the place is entirely in agricultural produce, and it has no manufactures of any kind.\n\n**JALAUN Tahsil.**\n\nJalaun is the largest tahsil in the district and has a total area* of 269,143 or 421 square miles. It lies between the parallels of 26\u00b0 0' and 26\u00b0 27' N. and 79\u00b0 3' and 79\u00b0 31' E. On the north it is bounded by the river Jumna; on the west by Gwalior territory; on the south-west by tahsil Kuneh; on the south by Orai, and on the east its boundaries march with those of tahsil Kalpi. Its shape is somewhat irregular in the south-east, where it extends southwards past Jalaun town. The tahsil consists practically of two portions. The easterly portion is an oblong lying between tahsil Orai and the Jumna, and constitutes the old pargana of Jalaun. In the extreme south flows a small deep-bedded stream called the Manmesari nala, which has caused a certain amount of deterioration in the villages that border it. A similar but deeper and more widely ramifying watercourse, the Melunga nala, passes in a north-easterly direction across the pargana somewhat below the centre, and between these two channels lies a level sketch of unbroken plain, of which the predominant and characteristic soil is mar. It is a fertile tract, unbroken by trees or groves or anything but the scarred mounds of ruined forts. North of the\n\n---\n\n* Exclusive of the jagirs of Jagamanpur, Rampara and Gopalpur, which have never been surveyed.\nMelunga nala the general conditions of the southern tract continue but the mar begins to deteriorate and gives place to kabar, all soils being much poorer than in the south. The black soil plain that forms the central basin of the district gradually contracts on either side and finally ends in an apex north of the village of Don. Beyond this, and throughout the north of the pargana, the conditions are wholly different. The change is well marked and almost abrupt. The most characteristic soil now becomes a light coloured sandy parua, and the features of the country change in unison; for instead of widely scattered sites in the centre of treeless expanses of black soil, small closely-set villages are found, where the cultivation is careful and crowded and the landscape is varied by groves of timber trees and mangoes. This fertile tract stretches to the ravines that border the Jumna. The latter vary from one to two miles in breadth and are a waste of steep, broken and intricate country which affords a little scanty pasturage for cattle and is fringed in the immediate course of the river by alluvial land of varying extent and fertility.\n\nThe second and westerly portion of the tahsil constitutes the bulk of the old pargana of Madhogarh, which was incorporated in Jalaun in 1891. It runs from the Kunch border on the south to the Jumna on the north; on the west it is bounded partly by the Pahuj and partly by the jagirs of Gopalpura, Rampura and Jagamanpur. The two latter encroach so far into its borders as to reduce it to a thin strip in the northern half. It is pre-eminently a parua tract, no less than 68 per cent. of the cultivated area consisting of this soil. On the south-east the soils are either parua or kabar, the latter being of the mixed type which marks the transition from the dark soil of the centre of the district to the pure parua of the north. On the west the surface rises towards the ravines and the soil is a white parua with a little kabar, while beyond the ravines the soils are alluvial parua and rakar with some kachhar. The northern villages form part of the old Kanar pargana which gave its name to the remarkably fine parua peculiar to it. Of the total area of the tahsil 40,422 acres or 15 per cent. are barren waste, being covered with water and sites or otherwise incapable of cultivation. In 1907 Jalaun had 4,467 acres covered with groves, an area nearly double that of any other tahsil in the\ndistrict, and normally some 175,000 acres are under the plough. The area of culturable waste and fallow land which varies with that under cultivation averages approximately 49,000 acres. The system of cultivation varies according to the soil characteristics of the tracts into which the tahsil is divided. In the mar portions it is the same as in other black-soil parganas: juar is the favourite crop in the kharif, and in the rabi the scene is one of endless fields of wheat and gram mixed. The appearance of the country in the northern parua tract is more reminiscent of a scene in the Doab than of Bundelkhand. Manuring is freely resorted to; irrigation is immensely prized and valued: earthen wells are sunk wherever the water level permits: population is dense, and every variety of crop is grown, including sugarcane. Here too the white or pisinya variety of wheat takes the place of the kathia or red variety. The standard of cultivation is on the whole distinctly high, and generally speaking Jalaun is under present conditions probably the most fertile and prosperous tahsil in the district. It is watered throughout by the Kuthaund branch of the Betwa canal and there are many wells: in 1907, a year of good rainfall, 24,861 acres were irrigated, and in the previous year, when the rainfall was seriously deficient, the total reached the high figure of 45,479 acres. Normally 56 per cent. of the total cropped area is devoted to kharif and 44 per cent. to rabi crops, the zaid harvest being here as elsewhere insignificant. The defasli area averages 7,000 acres, which is approximately double that of any other tahsil in the district.\n\nJalaun contains 381 villages and two towns divided into numerous mahals; the excessive number of the latter is attributed to the vigour with which joint responsibility in the collection of revenue was pressed in the earlier years of British administration. More mahals are owned in this tahsil in single or joint zamindari tenure than in any other, though small proprietors play a conspicuous part in its agriculture, here as elsewhere. The principal landholding castes are Brahmans, Rajputs, Kurmis and Gujars. The first are generally speaking the strongest caste in the south and centre, the second in the north and west, where the Gujars are also found: the Kurmis occupy almost entirely the mar tract. The majority of the cultivating proprietors are much reduced in\ncircumstances and differ little in their standard of living or comfort from the ordinary cultivator. These same castes, together with Ahirs, Kachhis and Chamars, form the bulk of the cultivating body. Nearly 40 per cent. of the holdings area is in the hands of tenants-at-will, 32 per cent. in those of occupancy tenants, and 25 per cent. in those of the proprietors themselves. The proportion of land in the hands of occupancy tenants has decreased in pargana Jalaun since the settlement of 1886 by nearly 12 per cent. This is attributed to desertions and relinquishments by the tenants themselves, especially between the years 1890 and 1900. There is no large proprietor in the tahsil, with the exception of the Raja of Sikri, but in the north there are several good villages held by a Marwari Brahman family of Waoli.\n\nOwing to the reconstitution and enlargement of the tahsil boundaries in 1891 it is impossible to compare statistics of population at previous censuses with those of 1891. In 1891 the population numbered 147,090 persons, and in 1901 this number rose to 160,881, the rate of increase being the largest in the district. The average density is 381 persons to the square mile, but it varies between 462 in the first class paruz villages of the north and 238 in the mar villages of the south centre. Of the whole population 77,348 were females. Classified according to religion there were 98,419 Hindus, 6,084 Musalmans, 22 Jains, 8 Christians, and 6 Aryas. Among the Hindus Chamars are the most numerous caste, amounting to 30,543 persons, and after them come Brahmans 23,215, Rajputs 17,339, Kachhis 12,345 and Koris 6,748. Other castes with over 5,000 members apiece are Ahirs, Gadariyas, Banias and Telis, while Kurmis, Nais, Kumhars, Dhobis, Kayasuls, Khangars and Lohars all exceed 2,000. The Rajputs belong to a large number of different clans, Sengars of course exceeding all others; but there are large bodies of Kachhwahas, Sikarwars, Rahtors, Chauhans, Bha-daurias, Parihars and Gaurs. Among the the Musalmans, Sheikhs and Pathans predominate, and there are only 60 Behnas. The tahsil is practically entirely dependent on agriculture, and there are no manufactures of any sort.\n\nJalaun contains the only two towns in the district which are now administered under Act XX of 1856, namely Jalaun and\nMadhogarh. There are however some important villages such as Hadrukh and Kuthaund which have been separately noticed, while others are Gohan, Sarawan, Kukargaon and Romai: few villages however possess a population of over 1,000 persons. Some others, such as Amkhera and Bhadek, have claims to notice on account of a former importance. A list of the schools, post-offices, markets and fairs of the tahsil will be found in the appendix.\n\nThe tahsil is on the whole well supplied with communications. It is as yet untouched by the railway, but metalled roads connect it with Orai on the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, and with the Phaphund station of the East Indian Railway vid Shergarh ghat and Auraiya in the Etawah district. Another metalled road runs from Jalaun vid Bangra to Madhogarh, and unmetalled roads radiate from Jalaun itself in all directions, which, though poor in the black soil tracts, are level and good in the parua soil to the north. Some earthwork on a projected railway line from Kunch to Jalaun was done in the famine of 1905-06 but the work was not completed. The Auraiya road is provided with a bridge of boats at Shergarh ghat, except during the rains, when its place is taken by a ferry, and there are six other public ferries at Romai, Mahtauli, Salaua, Bijalpur, Johikha and Keontra Karmukha, the last three being administered from the Etawah district. The Pahuj offers no obstacles to traffic on the west.\n\nIn the days of Akbar, the greater part of the tahsil was included in the mahals of Raipur, Bhadek and Kanar: the southern portion perhaps fell partly in those of Orai and Kunch. When it formed part of the Jalaun state it contained 116 villages only, the northern portion being in Kanar to the west, and the kanuni pargana of Kalpi to the east: Madhogarh lay to the west, and Ata on the east. After the Mutiny some villages were received from Madhogarh and some transferred, the resulting total being 142 in 1860. Subsequent alterations brought this number up to 153; 79 villages were added in 1866 from Kanar and 42 from the kanuni tract of Kalpi, making in all 274 villages. No further change was made till 1891, when tahsil Madhogarh was abolished. Jalaun then received 92 villages from Madhogarh and attained the dimensions, which, except for small modifications of no importance, it has since retained.\nThe tahsil now forms a criminal and revenue sub-division in the charge of a full-powered officer on the district staff. For purposes of police administration, there are stations at Jalaun, Hadrukh, Kuthaund and Madhogarh.\n\nKAHTA HAMIRPUR, Tahsil Kalpi.\n\nA large village lying in $25^\\circ 54'$ N. and $79^\\circ 40'$ E., on the road from Ata to Rath via Chandaut, which is metalled as far as Amisa. It lies 16 miles distant from Kalpi and the same from Orai, and is situated on the banks of the Betwa. In the rainy season a portion of the village lands is submerged by the river, which fertilizes a large extent of good alluvial soil. In 1901 the population numbered 639 persons, the predominant castes being Lodhis, Kewats and Ahirs, the first-named being for the most part zamindars. The village gains the second half of its name from the fact that it was formerly in the Hamirpur district, and was transferred to Jalaun in 1880.\n\nKAILIA, Tahsil Kunch.\n\nA large village in $25^\\circ 57'$ N. and $79^\\circ 2'$ E., close to the Kuthaund branch of the Betwa Canal in the south-west corner of tahsil Kunch. It is situated close to the unmetalled road which runs from Kunch to Duboh, at a distance of 11 miles from the former place. It formerly contained a police station and a pound, both of which have now been abolished, but the place of the former has been taken by an outpost of one head and three constables; it also possesses a post-office and a school, and a small bazar is held every Saturday. Close to the site are the ruins of an old fort which is now nazul property. In 1901 the population numbered 2,053 persons, the majority of whom were Gujars, Kurmis, Koris and Chamars.\n\nKALPI, Tahsil Kalpi.\n\nThe town of Kalpi lies in latitude $26^\\circ 8'$ N. and longitude $79^\\circ 45'$ E., on the banks of the Jumna river at a distance of 22 miles from the district headquarters. The Jhansi-Cawnpore trunk road passes through it, crossing the river by a\npontoon bridge, which in the rainy season is replaced by a boat ferry. The town, situated among rugged ravines, is on the whole well built, several of the better kind of houses being of masonry, though a large number are of mud and are inhabited by the poorer classes of agriculturists. Fair roads connect it with Hamirpur, Jalaun, Rath, Jalalpur, Madaripur on the Jalaun-Shergarh-ghat road, and other places. The roadway to the ghat on the town side has been carefully sloped to the bridge of boats, so that, in spite of the steepness of the river banks at this point, the crossing is a convenient and good one: on the Cawnpore side the bank shelves naturally through the ravines. The western outskirt of the town in a line with the Jumna is quite a region of old tombs: chief among them is the great tomb called Chaurasi Gumbaz; and some twelve other fine makbaras or mausoleums and some smaller tombs may be seen there. Formerly the town was said to adjoin these tombs, but now nothing remains of it in this quarter, a wide space cut by ravines dividing them from the present old town. There is a local tradition that Kalpi always moves south-eastward as times change, and so Ganeshganj, which is more important as regards trade than the old town, has been built southeast of it; but most south-easterly and most important of all is Ternanganj, where the existing trade now chiefly centres. The site of the old town is comparatively near the river, rather high, and cut up by ravines running down to the Jumna, especially in the outskirts; but there is plenty of level surface for the houses, which are thus fairly raised and present from a distance a good picture of an oriental town of the older and better sort, the darkened plaster walls and flat roofs interspersed with trees, with here and there a temple spire or a Muhammadan dome. The Jhansi road, leading down to the ghat, divides the old town from Ganeshganj. The site of the latter is lower and further from the river, yet the houses are well raised and the roadways have in several places been cut down so as to bring their surface to a better average level. Between Ganeshganj and the Jumna is a region of higher land cut up by ravines and the old cotton agency of the East India Company was established here. Its buildings still remain, having been well constructed, but are now empty: one of the principal godowns was till recently occupied by the Kalpi post-office,\nTernanganj, which was built about 1863 and named after Major Ternan, the first settlement officer of the Jalaun district lies to the south and a little east of Ganeshganj, with which it is connected by some straggling houses. Its site is nearly level, but is well drained by a natural drainage-way which cuts its eastern street.\n\nThe fort, now in ruins, is situated on the steep bank of the river dominating the ghat below. Of its internal buildings only one now remains, a one-roomed house with walls nine feet thick, said to have been the governor's treasury in Maratha times. Below the fort is a long flight of steps with several level landings, leading from the western side of the fort enclosure to a bathing ghat on the Jumna; there is a temple about half way down. An inspection bungalow has recently been built on the eminence occupied by the fort; of the latter now little remains except the scarp which looks sheer down into the Jumna, 120 feet below. A little to the west is a small walled cemetery containing the graves of Europeans who either died at Kalpi or were killed in the battle here in 1858.\n\nThe principal roadway of the old town is called the Bara Bazar. Entered from the east, it passes west for a short distance, and then turns due south until it reaches a wide ravine which intersects the town, dividing it into a northern and southern part; the latter contains few but mud-built houses. Where the roadway turns to the south it is arched by a gateway known as the Siri Darwaza, a sombre-looking structure with five battlemented points above, but no gates. The tradition is that the last Hindu Raja of the place was defeated and killed at Kalpi by the Musalmans, and that his head lies buried under this gateway. The short eastern part of the Bara Bazar is bordered by substantial houses of two or three storeys, the lower storeys opening on the roadway in the usual way and serving as shops. The establishment of Ganeshganj, Moneyganj and Ternanganj however has for the most part drawn away the shopkeepers. South of the Siri Darwaza the houses are meaner, and this portion of the town is largely in ruins. Besides the Bara Bazar there are several unmade but well-kept and level streets in other parts of the old town, which also contains some fair temples, mosques and other old buildings.\nGaneshganj, Moncyganj and Raoganj form a separate part of Kalpi, divided from the old town by the high road. This portion of it seems to have owed its origin in great measure to the establishment of the Government cotton agency. They bear evidence of having existed for a considerable time as the business portion of the town, and are really market-places, containing mainly wellbuilt houses. The tahsili stands in the southern outskirt of Ganeshganj and is now cut off from the town by the railway line and station. Ganeshganj is the most important of the markets and presents the appearance of a thriving place of business. Ternanganj is also a market-place of considerable importance, and has been constructed entirely in modern style and plan. It consists of a central circular open space of a large size, from which wide roads branch off in five directions. At the centre point a handsome well has been built and the roadways are entered beneath five gateways, which have upper and side rooms.\n\nIn Ganeshganj is situated a lofty tower, known as the Lanka, which was built by a local pleader, called Babu Mathura Prasad. Depicted on it are the great battles of the Ramayana, but Ravan not Rama is the central figure; he is represented as a gigantic, many-armed monster of dignified aspect, some 80 feet high. The builder affects the name of Lankesh. It is said that India contains no other building in honour of Rama's enemy. A fine view of the town, the river and the surrounding country can be obtained from the top of the tower, and it is even said that, on a clear day, Cawnpore, 48 miles away, can be seen with the aid of glasses. At the foot of the tower are bazars built in solid style, the shops surmounted by fantastic deities in stone.\n\nAt the beginning of the nineteenth century Kalpi was the great emporium of trade for the western states of Bundelkhand, and was also selected as the place of registration for the traffic up and down the Jumna. The chief articles of trade were cotton and ghi. The East India Company established a cotton agency in the place, and their purchases at one time are said to have amounted to forty lakhs a year, while private traders bought to the value of 18 lakhs. In 1830 the Company quitted the market for good, and from that time to 1842 private dealings also fell to some 7 lakhs annually. In 1860 a considerable\ndiscussion took place about the improvement of indigenous varieties of cotton and the introduction of new staples: American planters passed a season here, but failed to make American varieties grow with success. The trade in this article dwindled continuously: in 1874 the annual value of the cotton passing in the course of commerce through Kalpi, without stopping or breaking bulk, amounted to less than 10 lakhs worth annually, and the transactions of the town itself in the commodity did not exceed 2 lakhs worth. The ghi, which came for the most part, from the wild tracts of Hamirpur, was exported via Kalpi to Lucknow, formerly the wealthy and luxurious capital of the King of Oudh. In 1874 the annual exports hardly exceeded 1,000 maunds and found their way to Cawnpore. After many years of acute depression there has been a considerable revival of trade in the place. Two small ginning factories, belonging to Cawnpore firms, have been established for some years, and during the five years ending in 1907 some 4,500 maunds of raw cotton have annually been exported to Bombay. In addition to this an average of 156,649 maunds of oil seeds and 77,970 maunds of gram and pulses have been consigned at the railway station for export to Bombay or other places in India. The average imports during the same period have amounted to 232,642 maunds, consisting chiefly of raw sugar, salt and wheat.\n\nThe population of Kalpi was estimated by Sir William Muir in 1842 at 19,000 persons. Subsequent enumerations have shown that there has been a steady and large decline. The inhabitants numbered 18,514 in 1865, 16,568 in 1872, 14,306 in 1881 and 12,713 in 1891. At the last census in 1901 the population only amounted to 10,139 persons. Of this number 7,115 were Hindus, 2,942 Musalmans, and 10 Christians, and of the whole 5,132 were women. The town was constituted a municipality in 1867, and has been administered as such under successive Municipal Acts ever since. The existing board appointed under Act I of 1900 consists of the district magistrate as chairman, three members appointed by the Government and six elected by the ratepayers. Income is derived for the most part from octroi duties and is spent on conservancy, education and improvements: the details of receipts and expenditure will be found in the appendix. Besides the tahsili the place contains a first class police station, a flourishing vernacular\nsecondary school, managed by the district board, two boys' and one girls' school managed by the municipal board, a combined post and telegraph office and a pound. Market is held on Tuesdays, and three large fairs are annually celebrated, viz.,: the Sandal Talab Mela Sawan at the full moon in Bhadon, which is attended by some 5,000 persons, and the Pachpera Mela which takes place first in Chait and again on ninth of the light fortnight of Kuwar; these are attended by 3,000 persons.\n\nKalpi is a place of considerable historical importance. According to Ferishta it was founded by Basdeo or Vasudeva, who ruled at Kanauj and was the contemporary of Bahram Ghor, but the people attribute its foundation to an ancient Raja named Kalib Deva. One account gives it a place among the eight great forts of the Chandels. After being occupied and reoccupied by the Sultans of Delhi, Hoshang Shah of Malwa, the Jaunpur chiefs, Babar and Humayun, it became \"the gate of the west\" under Akbar and the starting-point for expeditions to Central India. It was the capital of a sarkar and had a mint for copper coinage. During the seventeenth century it was at one time in the hands of the Delhi emperors, and at another in those of Raja Chhatarsal, the great Bundela chief. By the latter it was consigned to the Marathas, who occupied it and made it the seat of authority from which the bulk of the Jalaun district was ruled. The first governor was Gobind Rao alias Gobind Bundela, who was killed at the battle of Panipat in 1761 A.D. He was succeeded by his son, Gangadhar Gobind. In 1798 it fell into the hands of the British, who subsequently abandoned it. It was recaptured in 1803 A.D. by the British from Nana Gobind Rao, subahdar of Jalaun, and, together with the neighbouring tract then remained in possession of the British till 1857, when it was occupied by the rebel army under Tantia Topi, the Rao Sahib, the Nana's cousin, and the Rani of Jhansi. After the defeat of the latter by Sir Hugh Rose it came into possession of the British again. From 1819 to 1823 Kalpi formed the headquarters of the district of Northern Bundelkhand. When these were removed to Hamirpur a deputy magistrate, who had subordinate control of the pargana, was stationed there. He was removed in 1853. From 1876 to 1881 it was again the headquarters of an assistant commissioner in charge of a sub-division.\nThe principal remains at Kalpi are the tombs of Madar Sahib, Ghafur Zanjani, Chol Bibi and Bahadur Shahid, and the great enclosure called Chaurasi Gumbaz or eighty-four domes. The latter is said to be the tomb of \"Lodi Shah Badshah,\" and some people even assign it to Sikandar Lodi. But he is known to have died near Agra, and his body was carried to Delhi to be buried. The Chaurasi Gumbaz is built of blocks of kankar set in lime mortar. All the ornamentation is in stucco, with flowered borders and bands, and the style altogether corresponds very closely with that of the Lodi period. The building stands on a lightly-raised podium and is square in plan, measuring 125 feet inclusive of the bastions at the angles; it occupies the centre of a large quadrangle 312 feet square on the exterior, which was formerly surrounded by cloisters. The origin of the name Chaurasi Gumbaz is doubtful. The building itself never contained eighty-four domes. Counting the domes at the angles, those at the middle of each fa\u00e7ade and that in the centre, the total number is only nine; but if the intersecting spaces of the roof created by the peculiar arrangement of the piers forming the aisles be taken into account, another 32 may be added. The name however is capable of another explanation. Although the fact is not noticeable to the casual visitor, there is little doubt that cloisters existed on all four sides of the quadrangle. If this was so, they consisted of eighty distinct bays roof-groined, to which the four domes over the angles of the main buildings may be added. The whole building is divided, something like a chess board, into eight lines of piers and seven lines of open spaces, thus forming 64 piers, all connected by twice 49 arches, with the 49 intervening spaces covered by flat roofs. In the middle there are four piers omitted, and the square space thus obtained is covered by a lofty dome which rises about 60 feet above the flat terraced roof of the main body of the building; it is now in a very ruinous condition. Altogether the building is a very solid structure of somewhat plain masonry, which is fast succumbing to the ravages of time.\n\nKALPI Tahsil.\n\nKalpi, pargana and tahsil, as at present constituted, lies between the parallels of $25^\\circ 53'$ and $26^\\circ 22'$ N. and $79^\\circ 25'$ and\n79\u00b0 52' E. It forms the north-eastern quarter of the district and is roughly triangular in shape, one side being bounded by the Jumna, parganas Jalaun and Orai lying to the west, and the base being formed by the Betwa river and the Baoni state. It has a total area of 259,179 acres or 405 square miles, out of which as many as 79,936 acres or 125 square miles are classed as barren and unculturable waste.\n\nThe surface of the tahsil exhibits far more irregularities and diversity of natural characteristics than any other portion of the district. The eastern front washed by the Jumna has in most places a strip of alluvial land of high fertility; this is succeeded by deep ravines, while beyond is an undulating ridge forming the high bank of the Jumna, which gradually merges into the central plain of the district. The Jumna ravines, though steep and intricate, are rarely more than 2 or 2\u00bd miles across, but in addition to them the pargana is threaded by a network of other ravines which have been formed round the petty streams draining into the main river. The principal among these is the Non, which traversing the centre of the pargana strikes the north-east of pargana Orai. The broken land round this river is on an average one-half to a mile wide on either side, and is remarkable for its abrupt declivities and sterility; the soil has in most places been completely eroded by the scour, leaving a rocklike surface of kankar exposed; there are a few fields on the lower levels, but these are often thickly coated with kankar. Equally destructive is a tributary of the Melunga which runs at right angles northwards through the heart of the pargana, surrounded by a deep border of waste land. Smaller streams draining into both are gradually widening the unculturable area. To the south there are two small streams, the Rayar and Jondhar, which join the Jumna near Kalpi: starting in uneven and undulating but not actually unculturable land, they too are flanked by ravines before reaching their destination. The Betwa valley resembles the Jumna without its fertility.\n\nThe pargana, commonly spoken of as the most precarious in the district, exhibits the extremes of barrenness and fertility. The alluvial lands along the Jumna are of great richness, though their distribution is capricious. The non-alluvial part may be said to be\ncomposed of scattered fragments of the big natural divisions into which the district falls. On the west it joins the outskirts of the mar plain of the centre of the district. The mar however at this point blends into kabar; it is patchy and of inferior quality and is neither of so dark a colour nor so retentive of moisture as the soil of pargana Orai. The kabar of this area has some of the properties of mar; it is a dark soil retaining a certain degree of moisture, but is hard and stiff, and unless softened by seasonable rains in September and October is very difficult to plough; it is highly susceptible to hans and subject to extraordinary vicissitudes of cultivation. This portion of the pargana is the best of the non-alluvial areas; it is amply provided with irrigation from the canal, and in addition to the mar there are belts of the better class of parua.\n\nOn the south, as far as Parasam, there is a continuation of the Betwa watershed like that in Orai. The land stands high and the soils are a thin parua or light coloured infertile kabar; it is however traversed by the Hamirpur branch of the Betwa canal, and is steadily improving in value. Beyond Parasam the river takes a sharp turn to the south and the border line is much broken by the intrusion of villages belonging to the Baoni state. The straggling villages which succeed belong to different conditions, and Babina and Margayan mark the beginning of a new mar plain which stretches into native territory. The country round the Rayar stream and the town of Kalpi is uneven, poor and cut up by ravines. Much of the soil, where not pure rakar, is of a reddish colour containing nodules of kankar; it is locally known as udra and has been classed as moti rakar. In the plateau to the north between the Meulnga ravines and the high bank of the Jumna, the white loamy parua, which is the distinguishing feature of the Jalaun villages to the west, begins; but not only is the soil itself inferior to the Jalaun parua, but the canal has not yet been extended to this tract and the system of cultivation is poorer.\n\nApart from the poverty of the greater part of the soil the pargana suffers from other drawbacks. Throughout the eastern half the water level is at a considerable distance, about 60 feet, from the surface. A few villages are actually unprovided with\nwells; in others the wells have not been sunk to a sufficient depth and give out in the hot weather. Drinking water is brought from long distances or procured from holes sunk in the beds of streams, while the cattle are sent to pick up a livelihood in the Jumna ravines. Mortality among the stock is excessive and is often quoted as a reason for the oscillations in the area under cultivation. As a further handicap the village sites are often posted in the ravines at a considerable distance from the culturable land and the application of manure becomes almost impracticable. Thus the curious spectacle is often exhibited of the worst lands being nearest the village and the best the most remote: cultivation by non-resident tenants with its attendant evils is necessarily resorted to. The advent of the canal is undoubtedly working a slow improvement in these conditions. The water level has risen near the main distributaries; the concession made by the Irrigation department of filling up the tanks at the end of the irrigation season has proved of incalculable benefit in preserving stock. Hamlets are being built on the upland to bring the cultivation nearer the irrigable tracts. The area covered with groves is only 685 acres and is the smallest in the district: there are 6,824 acres of culturable waste in addition to the large area of barren land. The area under the plough varies between wide limits, but averages some 112,800 acres, while the area of fallow land, old and new, which fluctuates with it, amounts normally to over 58,000 acres, exceeding by a considerable margin that of any other tahsil in the district. The area under double crops is on the average some 5,000 acres, and though considerably less than that of Jalaun, is equal to that of Kunch and double that of Orai. Thanks to the Betwa canal about 11,500 acres are annually irrigated, though in this respect again there are great fluctuations according to the season: the area watered from wells is very small and that from other sources, including tanks, practically non-existent. Whereas in all the other tahsils of the district the rabi are a greatly exceeds the kharif, in Kalpi the cropped area is almost equally divided between the two harvests, there being normally a slight preponderance of the kharif. The principal crops are cotton, juar and bajra mixed with arhar in the autumn, and gram alone or mixed with wheat according to the season in the spring. The area of hot weather crops is insignificant.\nKalpi Tahsil.\n\nIt may be gathered from the description already given of the conditions of the tract that cultivation is not of a high order and that the best class of cultivators has not been attracted to the pargana: Brahmans and Rajputs form 23 per cent. of the population and Kurmis and Lodhis only 3 per cent. Of the total holdings area 46\u00b796 per cent. is in the hands of Rajputs, 21\u00b790 per cent. in those of Brahmans and 8\u00b783 per cent. in those of Lodhis: Chamars and Ahirs are the only other castes that hold appreciable areas. At the settlement of 1903-06 41\u00b719 per cent. of the holdings area was held by tenants-at-will, 21\u00b741 per cent. by occupancy and ex-proprietary tenants, and 34\u00b795 per cent. by proprietors themselves: the last is a large proportion. The tahsil contains 204 villages divided into 411 mahals. Of the latter far the larger number are held in joint zamindari or imperfect pattidari tenure, especially in the partali portion of the pargana. The kanuni portion had a more troubled fiscal history and alienations of land have been greater. The chief proprietary castes are Rajputs, Brahmans and Gujars; Lodhis holds a few village towards the Orai border, and there are only two large proprietors, namely Thakur Jagdish Pershad of Bahai and Thakur Mukund Singh of Maghraul; the former owns six villages, paying a revenue of Rs. 6,120 and the latter eight villages with a demand of Rs. 5,375.\n\nThe population of the tahsil has decreased steadily during the past thirty years. In 1872 it numbered 93,294 and fell to 82,003 in 1881. The year 1891 saw a further decrease to 78,754 and at the last enumeration in 1901 there were only 75,692 persons, giving an average density of 187 to the square mile, including the town of Kalpi or 163 excluding it. Much of the loss appears to have fallen on the town. Classified according to religion there were 69,316 Hindus, 6,258 Musalmans, 60 Jains, 48 Aryas and 15 Christians. Among the Hindus, Chamars were the most numerous caste, amounting to 11,754 persons, and after them came Rajputs 10,420; Brahmans 7,010; Ahirs 4,135; Gadiyias 3,661; Koris 3,528; and Banias, 3,108. Other castes with over 2,000 members apiece were Kachhis and Lodhas. Among the Musalman population Sheikhs predominate, followed by Pathans, Behnas and Saiyids. The tahsil is almost wholly agricultural in character and almost the whole population is dependent directly on\ncultivation or allied occupations. The only town in the tahsil is the municipality of Kalpi. There are, however, several important villages, such as those of Ata, Babina, Parasan and Churkhi, which have been separately described; others are Maghraul, Cheonk, Sundi and Karmer.\n\nThe tahsil is on the whole well supplied with means of communication. The Great Indian Peninsula Railway cuts across it, and close to the Railway runs the metalled road from Jhansi to Cawnpore, which crosses the Jumna by a pontoon bridge below Kalpi town. A metalled road runs from Ata to Amisa, and unmetalled roads connect Kalpi with Hamirpur, Maghraul, Bhedrekhi, Parasan and Madaripur. The road from Orai to Hamirpur passes along the south-eastern portion of the pargana, and Ata is connected with Jalaun and Hadrukh by other roads. Some of these, however, are inferior owing to the extremely broken character of the country through which they have to pass. There is a large number of ferries over the Jumna which give access to the Bhognipur tahsil of the Cawnpore district, of which a list is given in the appendix. The schools, post-offices, markets and fairs of the tahsil are also stated there.\n\nIn the days of Akbar the greater part of the tahsil was included in the mahals of Kalpi and Raipur: the southern portions probably fell into those of Orai and Muhammadabad. The Bundelas probably further subdivided these, for at the British occupation we read of a pargana of Churkhi and it is not quite certain whether another was not formed with headquarters at Itaura. By the treaty of December 24th 1806,* Nana Gobind Rao, chief of Jalaun, ceded in perpetuity to the East India Company 62 villages in pargana Kalpi together with the town and fortress, and 14 villages in pargana Raipur, being at the same time confirmed in possession of the remaining 50 villages of pargana Kalpi, 17 villages in pargana Kharka, and the whole of parganas Kotra and Saiyidnagar in addition to his other estates. The southern portion of the present tahsil thus passed into the Raja's independent possession and was formed into a pargana under the name of Ata. In 1817 the same chief ceded, in addition to the pargana of Khandeh now in Banda, four more villages of pargana\n\n*Aitchison's Treaties II. page 231.\nRaipur, and the whole tract which stretched along the banks of the Jumna, about 50 miles long and only some four miles broad, became the pargana or, as it was called, the district of Kalpi: it contained an area of 178 square miles. This, from the fact that it was administered under the Bengal Regulations together with the rest of the Bundelkhand districts in possession of the British, came to be known as the kanuni tract of Kalpi. On the lapse of the Jalaun territories in 1840 Kalpi became the headquarters of the tahsil which was long called Ata, some villages on the west being transferred to Jalaun, and the whole or bulk of pargana Ata being incorporated with Kalpi. Some further changes were made in 1866, and in 1884 three villages were received by transfer to it from Hamirpur, but it has, except for such minor modifications, remained substantially unchanged since 1840. The Ata portion of the tahsil is known as the partali portion. Each portion had a separate settlement till 1905.\n\nThe kanuni portion was first regularly settled by Mr. Erskine in 1806 for one year: the demand fixed was Rs. 76,285. A triennial settlement was made by the same officer in 1807 resulting in an increase to Rs. 84,396: Mr. Wanchope raised the demand in 1810 to Rs. 89,074, and Mr. Waring in 1816 to Rs. 1,15,334. This was reduced by Mr. Valpy to Rs. 1,12,514 in 1821, and to Rs. 1,05,349 in 1826: it was further reduced to Rs. 93,067 by Mr. Ainslie in 1831, a sum which left was practically unchanged by Mr. Pidcock in 1836. Sir William Muir assessed this portion of the tahsil to Rs. 78,335, and in 1874 the sum fixed by Mr. White was Rs. 91,255. In the partali tract the first regular settlement was carried out by Major Ternan and modified by Mr. White, the demand fixed being Rs. 1,09,360. Owing, however, to the break-up of the Kanar tahsil in 1860, some redistribution of villages took place between Kalpi, Jalaun and Ata, and in 1874 the demand on the whole tahsil as then constituted amounted to Rs. 1,85,111, out of which Rs. 65,204 belonged to the kanuni tract. The partali portion was resettled by Mr. White in 1887 at Rs. 1,05,873. As the tahsil stands now the demand over the whole amounted in that year to Rs. 1,80,255. In 1905 it was settled for the first time as a single unit and assessed by Mr. H. R. C. Hailey at Rs. 1,33,730.\n\nThe tahsil now forms a revenue and criminal subdivision usually in the charge of a full-powered officer on the district staff.\nFor purposes of police administration there are stations at Kalpi Churkhi, and Ata.\n\nKANAR, Tahsil Jalaun.\n\nThe site of Kanar, which is now deserted, lay close to the Jumna river, about two miles north of Jagamanpur, in $26^\\circ 25' N.$ and $79^\\circ 15' E.$, and is still known as Kanar Khera. As Jagamanpur is built near the site, the Raja of that place used to be known as the Raja of Kanar Khera. The place is only important as having given its name from the time of Akbar till the British occupation to a pargana. The Kanar pargana formed part of the old Jalann state, and lapsed with it to the British in 1840. In 1850 it consisted of 117 villages, out of which 103 khalsa and ubari villages were assessed to a demand of Rs. 76,224. In 1860 it comprised 130 villages, 127 of which were assessed by Major Ternan to a demand of Rs. 61,421. The pargana at that time formed also a tahsil, the headquarters of which lay at Kuthaund. This was on the recommendation of Mr. White abolished in 1864, the component villages being absorbed in parganas Madhogarh, Jalaun, and Ata.\n\nKANJAUSA, Tahsil Jalaun.\n\nA village in the Jagamanpur jagir in $26^\\circ 25' N.$ and $79^\\circ 14' E.$ The population in 1901 numbered only 127 persons. It has some local celebrity as the spot where the united waters of four tributaries, namely the Chambal, Kuwari, Sindh and Pahuj, join the river Jumna. In commemoration of this, on the full moon of Kartik every year a large fair called the Pachnada is held. The fair now lasts for about two days and is attended by some 2,500 persons, and is visited by shopkeepers of all sorts from Etawah and Gwalior territory. It has, however, lost much of its importance. There is a tomb of one Baba Mukund Man Gosain, at which offerings are made, which are appropriated by the incumbent Gosain, who is also muafidar of the village.\n\nKHAKSIS, Tahsil Kunch.\n\nA large village in $26^\\circ 9' N.$ and $79^\\circ 14' E.$, seven miles due west of Jalaun and 11 miles north of Kunch. The village\nKunch.\n\nhad in 1901 a population of 3,694 persons. Three-quarters of the estate is owned by the Raja of Khaksis and one quarter by Chaudhri Jagmohan Singh, a Gujar. The village contains a school and a large fort now in a ruined state. The village gives its name to a Raja, who resides at Sikri in tahsil Jalaun; some account of him has been given in chapter III.\n\nKOTRA, Tahsil ORAI.\n\nAn old decayed town in 25\u00b0 48' N. and 79\u00b0 19' E., lying 15 miles south-south-east of Orai on the banks of the Betwa river. Unmetalled roads connect it with Orai and with Ait, the latter distant eight miles. At the beginning of last century Kotra, together with Saiyidnagar, gave its name to a pargana. It was also in imperial times an important place, and was closely besieged about 1700 A.D. by Raja Chhatarsal for two months. The local governor at the time was one Saiyid Latif, who bought off the Bundelas by the payment of a lakh of rupees. It was subsequently plundered by the same chieftain. There are numerous Muhammadan remains in the neighbourhood. The place was formerly famous for the manufacture and dyeing of variegated cloths, chiefly zamurd, which was said to be turned out to the annual value of 1\u00bd lakhs per annum, and chunari: an account of these has been given in chapter II. Kotra in old days is said to have had 250 Muhammadan families who earned their livelihood by the preparation of this cloth. At the present day, the dyeing industry is practically confined to the dyeing of kharua cloth. In 1872 Kotra had a population of 3,987 persons; this decreased to 3,519 in 1881 and to 3,415 in 1891. At the last enumeration in 1901, there were found to be only 2,873 persons in the town, of whom 732 were Musalmans. The town was administered under Act XX of 1856 from 1860 until 1905, when the provisions of the Act were withdrawn. It possesses a school, and market is held every Thursday, while large fairs take place at the Muharram and in Chait, and on the ninth day of the light fortnight of the month Kuar.\n\nKUNCH, Tahsil KUNCH.\n\nThe principal town of the tahsil is situated 18 miles west of Orai in 25\u00b0 59' N. and 79\u00b0 10' E. With Orai and Ait it is\nconnected by metalled roads, and a branch line of railway nine miles long was constructed in 1903 from Ait. Unmetalled roads radiate from it in all directions and run to Bangra, to Man, to Duboh in Gwalior, to Ingol and to Jakholi, while a road passes through it leading from Jalau to Punchh in the Jhansi district.\n\nThe site of the town is nearly level, and is enclosed by a shallow nala running along the south and east border and a similar nala on the western side; these form the sources of the Melunga. The town consists of a business end to the east and a quiet widespread country village to the west. In the latter portion, on the outskirt, there is the high site of an old ruined mud fort, on which the tahsil and police-station now stand. The eastern portion is first noticeable for a large tank called Gobind Rao's Tal, said to have been made over 150 years ago: it is fully 200 yards square, built with eight steps of good masonry on all sides and a small cupola at each corner. This goes dry now in the hot weather, but is generally replenished by canal water. The business part of the town commences immediately beyond the tank, near which there is an encamping-ground. Beyond the latter is the Ruihai Mandi, a cotton market where wheat is also sold; it consists of a fairly long and wide roadway with generally ruinous shops on either side. At right angles to this is the Gurai, a market-place for gur, and also for tobacco and rice. The Nimak hata or salt enclosure opens off from this, also at an angle, and is a wide street flanked with also generally ruinous houses. From these, the principal market-places, bazaars pass in several directions; these are all unmade and undrained. The school house stands in the middle of this business part at the end of a piece of straight open bazar: its precincts are, on three sides, a busy centre of traffic and there is a large courtyard at the back. Further to the west is the Manik Chauk, a general bazar of several streets but having a thoroughfare only through the gateways which shut it off from the rest of the town. The general aspect of the business part of Kunch is that of a somewhat neglected town, while the western portion consists of a few masonry houses surrounded by mud-built huts. Of late years its drainage and roads have been much improved by the municipality; and a new bazar called Calnanganj has been built, together with a large enclosure for grain brokers. At the beginning of the 19th\ncentury Kunch was a flourishing town. As late as 1840 it was a celebrated emporium of trade throughout Bundelkhand, and is said to have possessed 52 banking houses, while numerous remains of old buildings still testify to its departed celebrity. Several causes combined to ruin it. First the independent state at Jalaun disappeared; next, the town was devastated by the anarchy of 1857-58; but the greatest blow to its prosperity was the establishment of the customs line in 1860, which not only damaged the trade with the west, but almost put an end to the trade in salt, sugar and molasses to the south. Subsequently the construction of the metalled road from Cawnpore to Jhansi and the opening up of the Jhansi and Etawah districts diverted much of the traffic; and the railway finished the work of destruction to which the roads had contributed. Kunch was at that time ill-supplied with means of communication. Lying as it does in the centre of a black-soil tract, it was for some four months in the year almost totally cut off from the rest of the world as far as wheeled traffic was concerned. Since 1900 there has, however, been a considerable revival of trade: the customs line has long since been abolished, and the town has been connected with the metalled road and railway by feeder roads and a branch line of its own. The earthwork for a line running northwards towards Jalaun was commenced in the famine of 1906, but the project has for the present been abandoned. There is every reason to hope that trade will rapidly increase with the facilities now afforded to it. Market is held now every Friday; nine large fairs in various months of the year are celebrated in the place, attended by 2,000 to 10,000 people; a cotton ginning factory has been lately established; and the cattle market in the town is the largest and most important in this part of Bundelkhand.\n\nBesides the tahsili Kunch has a first-class police station, to which are also attached 28 municipal police; a first-class dispensary in the charge of an assistant surgeon; a flourishing town school; two primary schools, managed by the municipal board; a pound, and a combined post and telegraph office. It was constituted a municipality in 1867, and under the Municipal Act now in force (I of 1900) the board consists of the district magistrate as chairman, three members appointed by the Government and six elected\nby the ratopayors. The income is raised for the most part from octroi dues and expended in conservancy, improvements and education; details of both will be found in the appendix.\n\nThe population of Kunch in 1865 was 14,848 persons. Between 1872 and 1891 there was a steady decline from 14,488 to 13,408. At the last enumeration in 1901 a large and important increase was found to have taken place, and Kunch had risen to the position of the first town in the district, over Kalpi; the inhabitants on that occasion numbered 15,888 persons, of whom 7,631 were women. Classified according to religion there were 12,696 Hindus, 3,182 Musalmans and 10 Christians. Kunch was formerly the residence of an extra assistant commissioner, who was usually a magistrate of the first-class, in charge of parganas Kunch and Madhogarh; but it ceased to be so in 1884.\n\nThere are no remains of any note at Kunch except a small European cemetery, containing the bodies of some officers and others who fell in the action fought against Amir Khan Pindari, in 1804. In 1869 a monument was erected by the Government to their memory; it has an inscription as follows:\n\n\"Sacred in the memory of Captain Feade, Lieutenant Morris, Artillery, Lieutenant Gillespie, 1st Bn. 13th Reg., Assistant Surgeon Hooper and other brave men who fell in action with Meer Khan, Pindari, near Koonch, 22nd May 1804.\"\n\nKUNCH Tahsil.\n\nThe tahsil and pargana of Kunch forms the south-western quarter of the Jalaun district and lies between the parallels of 25\u00b0 51' and 26\u00b0 15' N. and 78\u00b0 56' and 79\u00b0 18' E. It is bounded on the south by the Betwa river and the Samthar state; on the west by the Pahuj, except where Datia territory intrudes like a wedge into it, and on the east and north by parganas Orai and Jalaun. Its maximum length is 26:50 miles and its maximum breadth 22:25 miles, but the latter narrows down to only a little over three miles where the Datia state encroaches. The total area of the tahsil is returned at 216,189 acres or 338 square miles.\n\nIf the ravine area which fringes the two rivers be excluded, the southern half of the pargana may be described as a mar plain of remarkable richness, broken by two lines of inferior soil. The first of these is a belt of light land mainly parua or poor kalar, which\nruns from south to north through the centre of the pargana. Its course is clearly marked, as it emerges on the south in mauzas Basob and Sunaya and, running in a north-easterly direction as far as the town of Kunch, proceeds due north to the Datia border. The quality of the soil deteriorates in the second stage with the result that villages of the poorest description are met with enclosed between some of the richest in the district. The second break in the mar is caused by the ravines round the Dhamna, a small stream which rising at Kailia joins the Pahuj near Maheshpur; these ravines widen out as the volume of the stream increases towards its junction with the Pahuj; the surface becomes very irregular, and the mar disappears.\n\nIn the northern portion of the pargana the soils are more varied. There is no wide expanse of any single soil as in the southern area. On the east there is a certain proportion of mar, but it occurs in patches and is of inferior quality. Kabar largely predominates; it is often a mixed soil known as dumattia; light in colour and containing a considerable element of parua. Towards the west the surface rises; the soil is mainly parua but the land is much broken up by small streams flowing into the Pahuj, and there is an extensive rukar area. In this half of the pargana the soils are in a transition stage from the mar of the centre of the district to the pure parua of the north. The change is indicated by a gradual modification of the character of the mar and kabar, and the more frequent appearance of parua in near conjunction with these soils. The two former are lighter in colour and less retentive of moisture than the purer soils to the south, and there is probably a certain blending of parua. The finest mar is found within a radius of six or seven miles from the town of Kunch within lines drawn parallel to the railway on the south, the Jalaun road on the north, the canal on the west and the pargana boundary on the east. That to the east of the town is considered superior to the soil on the west, though in some villages, such as Bohra and Khairai, no difference is noticeable. The characteristics of the best mar are its dark colour, its friability which admits of close sowing, and above all its capacity for retaining moisture. Of the total area of the tahsil 34,628 acres or 16 per cent. are recorded as barren waste, 2,417 acres are covered with groves and 2,296 acres are\nculturable waste. On the average some 123,000 acres are under the plough, and some 54,000 acres fallow; but both areas are liable to great fluctuations according to the seasons. The double-cropped area averages over 4,000 acres. The Kunch pargana has always enjoyed the reputation of being the most fertile and prosperous in the district. Mr. Muir's description of the kanuni tract in 1842 as the \"Garden of Bundelkhand\" is well known and often quoted. In 1876 it was stated that the assessment formerly gave a higher revenue rate than that of any district in the province. Though in point of productiveness Kunch is now eclipsed by the irrigated parua tract in the north of pargana Jalaun, it remains on the whole the most flourishing portion of the district. It has undergone less deterioration during the past 30 years of depression, its village communities have shown more power of resistance, and cultivation has been better maintained. It is now moreover better protected by irrigation than any other pargana, both branches of the Betwa canal running through portions of it.\n\nOn the other hand it is to be noted that the mar soil, to which the prosperity and richness of Kunch have hitherto been principally due, has peculiar defects, and it may be doubted how far it has retained its full qualities. Writing in 1842 Mr. Muir gave a vivid description of the extraordinary luxuriance of the crops he saw growing in the mar. He attributed the fertility of the soil in part to a flood, called the pau, which, flowing from the higher land of Samthar, settled over the adjoining country, imparting to it not only moisture but a rich deposit. Though Mr. White called attention to the value of this flood thirty years later, and elaborately described it, neither the villagers nor subordinate officials appear now to be aware of its existence, or even of the use of the word in this connection. It is therefore probable that road and railway construction, the digging of canals and drainage channels, have diverted the flood; and that this diversion has been responsible for a decline in the richness of the mar. The area of irrigation varies between wide limits: in 1905-06, a year of famine, 38,129 acres were watered; in 1906-07 only 7,879 acres received irrigation: and out of the whole only about 1,000 acres are served by wells. The hot weather harvest is as elsewhere in the district insignificant, but normally 62 per cent. of the cropped area is devoted to rabi and 38 per cent. to\nkharif crops. In the former harvest the staples are wheat and gram mixed, and in the later juwar mixed with arhar: unmixed gram, cotton and bajra are also grown. The standard of cultivation in the pargana is distinctly high: at the revision of settlement in 1903-06 no less than 83.72 per cent. of the culturable land was under the plough. As in other tahsils there is a fairly large proportion of Brahmans and Rajputs among the cultivators, but Kurmis hold no less than 25 per cent. of the total holdings area and Kachhis 4.12 per cent. The other chief cultivating castes are Gujars with 13.84 per cent. and Ahirs with 9.56 per cent. The higher castes preponderate only in the northern portion of the tahsil. Tenants-at-will hold 33 per cent., occupancy and ex-proprietary tenants 38 per cent. and the proprietors themselves 26 per cent. of the cultivated area, the remainder being rent-free. The tahsil contains 197 villages and one town; these are divided into 647 mahals. Of the latter 167, representing 18 per cent. of the total area, are held in single zamindari, 233 or 25 per cent. in joint zamindari, 75 or 10 per cent. in perfect and 172 or 47 per cent. in imperfect pattidari: there is one ubari mahal and one mahal paying only a half-jama. Though there is no large estate, the pargana includes a larger number of medium-sized properties held by well-to-do landowners than any other in the district. In the northern half eleven villages belong to the Sikri estate, and eleven more to the Rao of Gopalpura. In the southern portion five villages are owned by Lala Sundar Lal, a well-to-do Bania of Kalpi, and Musammat Sahudra Neto Marwarin has accumulated a large property extending over a number of villages. On the Betwa watershed the Rajputs of Pirona own seven villages; and there are also Kurni families of substantial position possessing several villages, as for instance, those of Bhend and Birgawan. The chief proprietary caste is the Kurmi, followed by Brahmans and Rajputs, but Gujars still own a substantial portion of the land, and Ahirs, Kayasths, Banias, Kanwaris and Musalmans are all found as landholders.\n\nOwing to changes in the pargana boundaries it is impossible to trace the fluctuations of population before the census of 1891. In that year the inhabitants numbered 102,815. In 1901 the number had risen to 104,588, of whom 50,371 were women, giving an average density over the tahsil of 309 persons to the square mile,\nincluding the town of Kunch, or 289 excluding it. Classified according to religion there were 98,419 Hindus, 6,084 Musalmans, 68 Aryas, 10 Christians, 6 Jains and one Sikh. Among the Hindus the most numerous caste was that of Chamars with 16,437 representatives; and after them came Brahmans 14,083; Kachhis 8,423; Kurmis 7,169; Koris 5,816; Rajputs 5,245; Ahirs 4,789; and Gadariyas 3,903; while Baniyas, Lodhis, Telis, Nais, Khangars and Gujars all numbered over 2,000 members apiece. The Rajputs belong to many different clans, but the bulk of them are Kachhwahas, Chauhans, Sengars, Bais and Parihars. The tahsil is almost wholly agricultural in character, the only other occupation at all largely represented being cotton weaving. The only town in the tahsil is Kunch, but there are several villages with a large population such as Basob, Kailia, Bhenn, Khaksis, Rendhar and Sunaya. The schools, markets, post-offices and fairs of the tahsil are stated in the appendix.\n\nMeans of communication are now good, though the unmetalled roads suffer from all the well-known defects where they traverse black cotton soil. The Jhansi-Cawnpore section of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway cuts across the south-eastern border, and Kunch town is connected with it by a branch line from Ait. Metalled roads run from Orai and Ait to the headquarters. The unmetalled roads comprise those running from Jalaun to Punchh, from Kunch to Bangra, Ingoi, Jakholi, Mau and Salaiya, and from Dhauja to Parawar. There is a ferry over the Pahuj at Salaiya.\n\nThe tract now comprised in Kunch seems to have been early occupied by Gujars and Kurmis. Early in the thirteenth century the Bundelas fixed their capital at Mau Mahoni on its western border and presumably reduced it to subjection: for a short time before this it was perhaps ruled by the Khangars of Kurar. In the days of Akbar it formed a mahal in the sarkar of Erichh, and remained generally in the possession of the Muhammadans, who either managed it direct or farmed it to Bundela chiefs, till it was overrun by Chhatarsal about 1700 A.D. It passed from the hands of Chhatarsal into those of the Marathas. The \"pargana of Kunch,\" then containing 92 villages, was ceded to the British by Jaswant Rao Holkar in 1805, along with other territory. As an act of grace, however, the revenues of the tract were assigned as a\nlife-grant to his sister Bhima Bai Sahiba, though the administration remained in the hands of the collector of Bundelkhand. When parganas Kachhwahagarh, Indurkhi, Lahar and Duboh, ceded for the upkeep of the Gwalior contingent in 1844, were restored to Sindhia in 1860, 39 villages from the former and 22 from the latter lying east of the Pahuj were added to Kunch. No other modifications of importance were made till 1891 when pargana Madhogarh was abolished and 55 of its component villages were added to Kunch. These changes make the fiscal history of the pargana confusing. The 92 villages granted to Bhima Rai form the old kanuni portion of the tahsil, and their revenues did not lapse to the British till 1858, when the assignee died. They were settled in the same way as the kanuni portion of Kalpi and assessed by Mr Erskine in 1806 to Rs. 1,72,517 and in 1807 to Rs. 1,73,929. Mr. Wauchope raised the demand in 1810 to Rs. 1,84,742, Mr. Waring in 1816 to Rs. 2,16,533 and Mr. Valpy in 1821 to Rs. 2,18,140. The last demand was retained through Mr. Valpy's second settlement in 1826, Mr. Ainslie's settlement in 1831 and Mr. Pidcock's revision in 1836; but in 1841 Mr. Muir reduced it to Rs. 2,02,798. The tract was resettled by Mr. P. J. White in 1874 at a sum of Rs. 1,93,610. The 39 Indurkhi villages were settled regularly for the first time by Major Ternan in 1861 at Rs. 17,084, while the settlement of pargana Duboh was carried out by Mr. Freeling in 1856, who fixed a demand of Rs. 16,173 on eighteen villages: the four others, which were ubari, were resumed by Major Ternan and settled by him at Rs. 3,374. Shortly after in 1866, owing to the abolition of pargana Kanar, some redistribution of villages among the various tahsils took place, 12 villages of the kanuni tract being transferred to Madhogarh, and in 1871 the revenue of the Kunch pargana stood at Rs. 2,10,221 on revenue paying estates alone. In 1887-89 the partali portion was again resettled, and the total demand as it stood then on the tahsil as now constituted after the absorption of Madhogarh in 1891 amounted to Rs. 3,18,803. The tract was settled as a single unit for the first time in 1304 at Rs. 2,67,490.\n\nFormerly and till about the year 1884 Kunch and Madhogarh formed a separate sub-division administered by an extra-assistant commissioner stationed at Kunch. Kunch now forms by itself a\ncriminal and revenue sub-division usually in the charge of a full-powered deputy collector on the district staff. For purposes of police administration there are stations at Kunch, Mau and Rendhar and outposts at Sunaya, Kailia, Bangra, Parawar and Ingoi.\n\nKUSMILIA, Tahsil ORAI.\n\nA large and flourishing village in $25^\\circ 55' \\text{N.}$ and $79^\\circ 27' \\text{E.}$, distant seven miles from Orai on the unmetalled road to Rath. It had in 1901 a population of 2,254 persons, chiefly consisting of Lodhis and Rajputs, and contains a school and the ruins of an old fort. A weekly market is held on Saturdays.\n\nKUTHAUND, Tahsil JALAUN.\n\nA large village in $26^\\circ 22' \\text{N.}$ and $79^\\circ 26' \\text{E.}$ lying on the metalled road form Jalaun to Shergarh-ghat, 15 miles from the former and 7 miles from the latter place; unmetalled roads run to Madhogarh and Umri. The village gives its name to the westerly branch of the Betwa canal, which tails off into some ravines about three miles to the east. It now contains a district bungalow, a canal inspection house, a second-class police station, a school, a post-office and a pound, and was formerly the headquarters of the pargana and tahsil of Kanar, which was broken up in 1864. The village formerly belonged to the Jagamanpur jagir, but along with 27 others was resumed by the Marathas, who kept a kamadar or agent here for the realization of revenue. The population in 1901 numbered 1,757 persons, and consisted for the most part of Rajputs, Brahmans, Chamars, Koris and Kachhis. The tahsil buildings have all been demolished and the only building of any interest is a temple built by the Marathas. There is a military encamping-ground close to the site.\n\nMADHOGARH, Tahsil JALAUN.\n\nA town lying in $26^\\circ 17' \\text{N.}$ and $79^\\circ 13' \\text{E.}$, 13 miles north-west of Jalaun, with which it is connected by an unmetalled road direct, and a metalled road, 17 miles long, via Bangra: other roads run to Jagamanpur, Rampura, Gopalpur and Kuthaund. Madhogarh contains a first-class police station, a dispensary, a post-office, both\na boys' and a girls' school and a pound, while the old tahsili buildings have been converted into a rest-house, combined with a school in the lower storey: in the village there is a large sarai. The town had and still has a local repute for a species of sugarcane called roni-ji-ka-bura; the sugar made from it however, is of an inferior description though largely consumed in the neighbourhood. Irrigation is extensively practised in the neighbourhood and the cultivation of sugarcane is spreading. It is now an important market for ghi and cotton, which are generally exported to Auraiya in Etawah, and, for eight months in the year, a railway agency is maintained here. A bazar built some 20 years ago under the name of Whiteganj has forced the prosperity of the town.\n\nMadhogarh was formerly the headquarters of a pargana and a tahsil, and the residence of a tahsildar. It, along with parts of pargana Duboh and Indurkhi, was received from Sindhia in 1844, as security for the payment of the Gwalior contingent. It then consisted of 119 villages, but the portion west of the Pahuj was restored to Sindhia in 1860. When Major Ternan settled the pargana in 1861 it contained 103 villages, to which four were added from pargana Jalaun and 18 from Kunch. The tahsil was abolished in 1891, and the component villages distributed over Kunch and Jalaun.\n\nThe old name of Madhogarh is said to have been Raniju. It has been administered under Act XX of 1856 since 1860, the total income and expenditure being about Rs. 900: a police force of one jamadar and eight chaukidars is maintained. The population of the town in 1865 was 2,967 persons; it fell to 2,718 in 1872, but rose to 3,438 in 1881, and though there was another fall to 3,040 in 1891, at the last census in 1901 the number of inhabitants had risen to 3,538, out of which only 236 were Musalmans.\n\nMAU, Tahsil Kunch.\n\nMau is a considerable village on the Pahuj river near the western boundary of Kunch tahsil, and lies in 26\u00b0 3' N. and 79\u00b0 E. It is 32 miles distant from the district headquarters and 14 miles a little north of west of Kunch, with which it is connected by an unmetalled fifth class road. Mau contains now a school, a post-\noffice, a pound, and a police station; and in 1901 it had a total population of 1,182 souls, the majority of whom were Ahirs. The latter are owners of the village; they possess a large number of cattle and carry on a fairly extensive trade in ghi, which is exported via Kunch to Bombay. The village is generally known as Mau Mahoni to distinguish it from numerous other places of the same name scattered over Bundelkhand; and, if the traditions are to be believed, was the first stronghold of the Bundelas, before they overran the rest of the tract, to which they subsequently gave their name.\n\nIn this connection it is interesting to note that the Raja of Beona, who resides not far off in the same tahsil, actually represents the senior branch of the Bundela line, tracing its descent through Birbal, the elder son of Malkhan; while the Rajas of Orchha, Datia, Charkhari and others are sprung from Rudr Partap, the younger son. Mau itself contains an old ruined fort, but Mahoni, which lies a short distance across the river in Gwalior territory, has a ruined temple of Devi, apparently of some antiquity: the image of the goddess, however, is overturned, this position being attributed to Muhammadan iconoclasts. The ravines round the village formed a Pindari stronghold for a short time in 1803 and it was not far from here that an engagement took place between them and the British troops.\n\nMOHANA, Tahsil ORAI.\n\nA large village lying in 25\u00b0 49' N. and 79\u00b0 29' E. on the banks of the Betwa, amid wild and broken ravine country. It is situated 14 miles to the south of Orai, with which it is connected by an unmetalled road. The village had in 1901 a population of 1,150 persons, chiefly consisting of Lodhis, and it contains a third-class police station, a pound, and a post-office. There is also a public ferry over the Betwa on the road to Rath.\n\nMUHAMMADABAD, Tahsil ORAI.\n\nA large village in 25\u00b0 56' N. and 79\u00b0 29' E., four miles south of Orai. The population in 1901 numbered 1,513 persons, chiefly consisting of Lodhis, and the village contains a school. It was once a place of some importance, and both in the days of Akbar and those\nof the Jalaun subahdars gave its name to a pargana, which has long since been absorbed in Orai. The village is a prosperous one, and contains still a large number of brick houses: it was formerly owned by Rajputs, but the proprietary right is now for the most part in the hands of Kayasths, some of whom are hereditary qanungos.\n\nORAI, Tahsil ORAI.\n\nThe headquarters of the tahsil of the same name and of the district of Jalaun lies in $25^\\circ 59'$ N. and $79^\\circ 28'$ E. It is situated on the Jhansi-Cawnpore trunk road at a distance of 68 miles from Cawnpore and 71 miles from Jhansi. Metalled roads lead to Kunch and Jalaun, and unmetalled roads to Mohana, Hamirpur, Kotra and Damras.\n\nThe former village of Orai stood on a hillock of considerable size, but it has now extended for some distance beyond the hillock to the south in the direction of what was formerly called Naya Basti. The Jhansi high road runs through this latter portion and in great measure gives shape to it, for it is long and narrow and follows the road, which at this point makes a considerable curve. The town, both the old and the new, retains its appearance of a considerable village, masonry buildings being few and small. A road has been constructed through it, cutting off the curve of the Jhansi road, and at right angles to this runs the bazar, which forms a chawk. To the north of the hillock on which the old village is situated runs a deep channeled nala, beyond which lies the civil station. On rising ground beside the Jalann road are found the collector's court, the residences of the collector and superintendent of police, the combined sessions court, judge's residence and church, with the district jail further to the south, and one or two other scattered bungalows. By the side of the Jhansi road nearer the town are some more bungalows and the old public gardens, and about a mile to the west again lies the site of the agricultural experimental station. A fine circular road lined with trees completely encircles the civil station. The railway station, with the quarters of some railway officials, is situated about one mile to the west of the town. Orai contains no buildings of archaeological or other importance. There are the remains of an old brick fort, a short distance beyond its boundaries, and scattered round are some Muhammadan tombs. There is a fine tank by the side of\nthe Jhansi road on the southern edge of the town, which has masonry ghats on the village side, while on the opposite bank stands the zila or high school: the tank holds water throughout the hot weather and is much resorted to for both drinking and bathing purposes. Carved stones of black granite scattered about as door steps and posts are numerous. Orai was selected by Lieutenant Doolan in 1839 as the headquarters of the newly acquired territory of Jalaun, owing to its better position on the highroad and its more healthy situation. In 1865 it had a population of 6,461 persons, and was at first administered under Act XX of 1856. It was constituted a municipality in 1871, and at the census of 1872 had a population of 6,398 persons. This number rose to 7,738 in 1881 and to 8,369 in 1891. At the enumeration of 1901 there were 8,458 inhabitants. Classified according to religion these included 5,980 Hindus, 2,374 Musalmans, 61 Christians, 11 Jains and 32 persons of unspecified religion. Of the whole number, 3,945 were females. The affairs of the town are now managed by a board, constituted under Act I of 1900 and composed of ten members, the work of secretary being generally performed by a paid servant of the board. Income is raised for the most part by octroi dues and expended in conservancy, education and works of improvement; details of the accounts will be found in the appendix.\n\nOrai contains a tahsil building, an anglo-veracular school, a middle vernacular school, a first-class police station, a dak bungalow situated close to the sessions court in the civil lines, a military encamping ground, a pound and a combined post and telegraph office. It formerly had some trade in cloth, but now is only a small centre for export and import trade in agricultural produce. In reality it is a place of no importance otherwise than as the headquarters of the district.\n\nORAI Tahsil.\n\nThe present pargana and tahsil of Orai lies between the parallels of 25\u00b0 46' and 26\u00b0 3' N. and 79\u00b0 7' and 79\u00b0 34' E. It is bordered on the south by the Betwa river, on the north by pargana Jalaun, and on the east and west by tahsils Kalpi and Kunch. In shape the pargana forms a rough quadrilateral. It reproduces in miniature the main physical characteristics of the district as a whole,\nbelts of high land on three of its boundaries descending to a flat level plain in the centre. The most marked features are the mar plain in the centre and the upland ridge on the south which gives way to the ravines flanking the Betwa. The mar plain is wedge-shaped, its starting-place being in the neighbourhood of Orai, whence it broadens out, steadily improving in quality until it meets the Kunch border on the west. This tract forms by far the richest and most fertile part of the pargana. On the south of the mar villages the surface rises imperceptibly, the soil changes first to kabar and then to parua, until the high ridge is reached on which the Hamirpur canal now runs. This ridge, known as the uparhar or upland, as contrasted with the behr or ravine valley, runs the length of the pargana at a distance varying generally from two to four miles from the river; it falls away abruptly on the edge of the ravines. To the spectator standing on the highest point of this ridge, the ravines present a spectacle of a waste of low rounded hills, the uniform dull colour being relieved only by occasional patches of green on the kachhar lands or the sparkle of the river winding between deep banks. In point of agricultural value this land stands at the opposite end of the scale to the mar. The villages on the eastern and western borders of the tahsil alike stand on higher ground than those in the centre, and there is the same characteristic gradation of soils from heavier to lighter; but in both cases the mar runs nearer to the border line than it does to the south; and the change in conditions is less marked and affects a smaller number of villages. The north-east of the pargana comes under the influence of a small river called the Non, which is surrounded by deep ravines, and a group of villages situated between this river and a tributary, the Orai nala, differ little in character from those lying on the Betwa. Smaller nalas joining this main stream are gradually eating their way eastwards and southwards, and their scour where unchecked is reducing fertile land to almost barren rakar.\n\nThe total area of the tahsil is 196,492 acres or 307 square miles, out of which 41,041 acres or nearly 21 per cent. are returned as barren; only 984 acres are covered with groves and 7,833 acres are recorded as culturable waste. The cultivated area averages normally 97,650 acres, of which only 2,500 are twice-cropped in the year; and the fallow area 49,450 acres, the bulk of which is old\nfallow. The irrigated area varies, as elsewhere in Bundelkhand, within wide limits. In a wet year such as 1906-07 it only amounted to 3,395 acres, but in 1905-06 it reached 14,551 acres; only some 650 acres are served by wells and other sources of irrigation, including tanks, are practically non-existent. Of the total cropped area over 68 per cent. is normally devoted to rabi crops, the most widely grown crop being the mixed wheat and gram sown in the fertile mar soil on which the success of the season largely depends. Juar in combination with arhar is the principal kharif staple; next to this come hajra and cotton in almost equal amounts. The hot weather harvest is utterly insignificant.\n\nThe system of agriculture is on the whole poor. The pargana is extremely deficient in population, and cultivation by non-resident tenants prevails to an unusual extent, large tracts of the central mar plain being cultivated by migratory tenants from the Betwa-side villages. Kans runs riot everywhere, and the pargana has suffered in an unprecedented degree from agricultural depression. On the other hand the tahsil is second only to Kunch in the number it possesses of the better agricultural castes: Lodhis hold over 40 per cent. and Kurmis over 18 per cent. of the total holdings area. The only other important cultivating caste is that of Brahmans. At the revision of settlement in 1903-06 tenants-at-will held 38\u00b787 per cent., occupancy tenants 15\u00b748 per cent., and proprietors 43\u00b798 per cent. of the holdings area. Here, more than anywhere else in the district, the distinction between proprietors and tenants is ill-defined, many of the former being merely proprietors cultivating in one another's pattis. The smallness of the acreage held by occupancy tenants is noticeable: not only has this decreased, but it was never very large owing to the deficiency of population. In Orai the place of resident tenants is largely taken by non-residents, who have no ties which bind them to the soil they cultivate, and whose tillage is hasty and inferior. The depression into which the pargana has fallen has been largely aggravated by the extent of cultivation by non-resident tenants; for at the first hint of bad seasons non-residents do not come to cultivate at all, and if there has been any crop failure they cannot be pressed for rent. Orai contains 135 villages divided into 383 mahals, the number of the latter having been greatly increased during the troublous period at the end of the last century.\nThe chief proprietary castes are Brahmans, Rajputs, Lodhis, Kurmis and Ahirs; during the currency of the settlement which expired in 1903 all lost ground except the first, while Banias considerably increased their possessions. There is no large proprietor of any sort in the tahsil, and the ex-propriation of the proprietary communities has been a serious loss to the pargana. The population of the tahsil increased steadily between 1865 and 1881, rising from 61,569 in the former to 72,300 in the latter year. In 1891 it numbered 67,702 and in 1901 fell to 59,065 persons, the lowest figure attained since the inauguration of regular censuses. Of this number 28,902 were females, and the average density was only 192 persons to the square mile. Classified according to religion there were 53,668 Hindus, 5,252 Musalmans, 61 Christians, 45 Jains, 19 Aryas, 14 Sikhs, and 6 Parsis. Among the Hindus, Chamars were numerically the strongest caste, amounting to 8,913 persons, and after them came Brahmans 5,325, Lodhis 5,048, Ahirs 4,174, Kachhis 3,423, and Koris 3,227. The only other castes with numbers exceeding 1,500 were Kurmis 2,510, Rajputs 2,429 and Banias 1,835. The main Rajput clans represented were Parihars and Sengars. Among the Musalman population Sheikhs and Pathans predominated. The tahsil is almost wholly agricultural in character, the only manufacture being that of khariua cloth at Kotra and Saiyidnagar which has been already described.\n\nOrai now possesses only one town, that of Orai where the district headquarters are situated. Kotra and Saiyidnagar were administered under Act XX of 1856, but its provisions were withdrawn from them in 1904 and 1901. Among villages Kusmilia, Muhammadabad and Ait may be mentioned, but none are very large. The tahsil is well supplied with means of communication. The Jhansi-Cawnpore section of the Great Indian Peninsula railway runs across it, and a branch line connects Kunch with Ait. Parallel to these run metalled roads, and Kunch and Jalaun have direct communication with Orai by other metalled roads. Among the unmetalled roads are those from Orai to Hamirpur, Kotra, Churkhi, Damras, Tikar and Mohana, from Ait to Kotra, and from Saiyidnagar to Timron, and the Orai circular road. There are ferries over the Betwa at Kotra, Saiyidnagar and Mohana. A list of the schools, markets, post-offices and fairs will be found in the appendix.\nOf the earliest history of Orai we have no knowledge. In the days of Akbar the tract was divided between the mahals of Orai and Muhammabad in the sarkar of Kalpi; possibly a portion fell into the mahal of Erichh in the surkur of the same name. At the beginning of the nineteenth century the tract was distributed over parganas Orai, Kharka, Muhammadabad, Saiyidnagar and Kotra, the subdivision probably being due to the Bundelas. By the treaty of December 24th, 1896, Nana Gobind Rao, subahdar of Jalaun, was confirmed in possession of all his estates, which included pargana Orai, having received in exchange for the town and pargana of Kalpi 50 villages from the pargana of Kalpi, 17 from that of Kharka, 36 in Kotra and 14 in Saiyidnagar. These covered the whole of the present tahsil. It lapsed with the rest of the Jalaun state in 1840. In 1863 it contained 129 villages which were assessed to Rs. 1,67,150. It was resettled in 1887-89 by Mr. P. J. White at Rs. 2,17,707 and at the revision in 1903 was assessed to Rs. 1,38,995.\n\nThe tahsil now forms a revenue and fiscal subdivision usually entrusted to a full-powered officer on the district staff. For purposes of police administration there are stations at Orai, Ait, Mohana and Saiyidnagar.\n\nPARASAN, Tahsil Kalpi.\n\nA large agricultural village with a total area of 11,260 acres, lying in 25\u00b056' N. and 79\u00b044' E., on the banks of the Betwa, distant 14 miles from Kalpi and 16 miles from Orai; it is situated at a short distance from the Orai-Hamirpur second-class road. Tradition says that a rishi, named Parasar, lived and performed religious exercises in the place, and a small temple has been built in his honour on the banks of the river. The village is called Parasan after him, and the shrine is an object of resort for numbers of pilgrims. In 1901 the population numbered 1,976 persons, mainly consisting of Rajputs, Brahmans, Chamars and Ahirs. There is a station of the great trigonometrical survey in the village.\n\nPARAWAR, Tahsil Kunch.\n\nA small village in 26\u00b012' N. and 79\u00b03' E., on the banks of the Pahuj river, 19 miles west of Jalaun: it is connected by unmetalled\nroads with Gopalpur and Rendhar. The village in 1901 had a population of 658 persons, mainly consisting of Kachhwaha Rajputs. It contains a police outpost, consisting of one head and three constables, which is maintained to protect the district from dacoits from Gwalior.\n\nPIRONA, Tahsil Kunch.\n\nA large village in 25\u00b0 51' N. and 79\u00b0 10' E., on the Jhansi-Cawnpore trunk road, distant 21 miles from Orai and about four miles from the Betwa river. The village is owned by a body of Dhundhera Rajputs, who reside as tenants of the nazul office in the old fort; it contains a pound. The population in 1901 numbered 1,566 persons, chiefly consisting of Ahirs. The railway station of the same name on the Great Indian Peninsula Railway is situated about a mile and-a-half away in the lands of mauza Chamari.\n\nRAIPUR, Tahsil Kalpi.\n\nA much-decayed village lying in 26\u00b0 19' N. and 79\u00b0 33'E., close to the banks of the Jumna river, at a distance of 23 miles from Orai and 19 miles from Kalpi. It is not connected with any place by road; the nearest road, viz., the unmetalled road from Kalpi to Madaripur, on the metalled road between Jalaun and Shergarh, passes six miles to the south at Damras. Extensive ruins of houses and temples testify to the former importance of the place, which from the days of Akbar to the cession of the district to the British formed the headquarters of a pargana. Its prosperity appears to have been derived largely from the trade along the Jumna, and to have decreased as this gradually vanished; and the population in 1901 only numbered 461 persons. The owners of the village, like the majority of the inhabitants, are Brahmans. There is a ferry over the Jumna at this point, which is managed by the district board of Jalaun.\n\nRAMPURA, Tahsil Jalaun.\n\nThe capital of the jagir of the same name lies in 26\u00b0 23' N. and 79\u00b0 13' E., on the edge of wild and broken country stretching down to the Pahuj. It is distant 30 miles from Orai, 18 miles from\nJalaun, and 5 miles from Madhogarh; with the last it is connected by an unmetalled road. Rampura is a considerable town with a population of 4,614 persons: it has a large bazar, and is a local market for trade in grain, cotton and ghi. The place is the residence of Raja Ram Singh, a Kachhwaha Rajput, who holds 46 villages in jagir, of which some account has been given in chapter III. He maintains his own police, under the superintendence of the district magistrate, and has his own liquor, drugs and opium shops, though he is required to obtain the drugs and opium under regulation. The palace of the Raja is a massive and handsome structure built on high ground overlooking jungle-covered ravines, in which are preserved some good game; and there is a second fort at Tihar distant one and-a-half mile to the north-east. The Raja himself is exempt from the ordinary provisions of the Arms Act, and is allowed to keep two cannon: he maintains two schools at Rampura and Tihar respectively. There is no building of interest in the village, which is inhabited by a miscellaneous body of Brahmans, Rajputs, Kachhis, Koris, Ahirs and Gadariyas.\n\nRENDHAR, Tahsil Kunch.\n\nA large village in 26\u00b0 10' N. and 79\u00b0 8' E., 25 miles north-west of Orai and 15 miles west of Jalaun, with which it is connected by a partly metalled and partly unmetalled road via Bangra. It contains a first-class police station, a school, and a post-office; a weekly market is held on Wednesdays. In 1901 the population numbered 1,565 persons, chiefly consisting of Brahmans.\n\nSAIYIDNAGAR, Tahsil Orai.\n\nAn old town on the banks of the Betwa river, lying in 25\u00b0 48' N., and 79\u00b0 17' E., distant 16 miles from Orai. It is connected by an unmetalled road with Ait, distant seven miles. The town was of some importance in Muhammadan times, as is shown by the number of mosques and tombs in the place. Jointly with Kotra it gave its name to a pargana: and like that place was famous for the manufacture of zamurd\u00ed cloth. The industry has now greatly decayed, and little but kharua cloth is now made. Act XX of 1856 was applied to Saiyidnagar in 1860 along with Kotra: in 1865\nit had a population of 2,560 persons, in 1872 of 2,980, in 1881 3,157 and in 1891 of 3,267. By 1901 however the number of the inhabitants had fallen to 2,088, and in that year the provisions of the Act were withdrawn. In 1891, when it was still a town, the Musalman population numbered 404. Besides the Muhammadan buildings, there are a number of temples, and close by, though actually situated in the lands of mauza Nunbai, is the shrine of Achru Devi, which enjoys some celebrity and is visited by pilgrims from a considerable distance in April and October. Just north of the village lies the one solitary hill in the district, where broken granite is quarried for the repair of the Jhansi-Cawnpore road.\n\nThe town contains a third-class police station, a pound, a school and a post-office. Market is held on Wednesdays, and there is a public ferry over the Betwa.\n\nSALAIYA BUZURG, Tahsil Kunch.\n\nA considerable village lying in 25\u00b0 57' N. and 78\u00b0 58'E., in the extreme south-west corner of the tahsil, close to the Pahuj river, distant 14 miles from Kunch. The population in 1901 numbered 1,257 persons, mainly consisting of Kanwaris and Gadariyas. The village contains an old fort, which is now nazul property, and generally has a police guard stationed in it. There is a public ferry also over the Pahuj.\n\nSUNAYA, Tahsil Kunch.\n\nA village lying in 25\u00b0 65' N. and 79\u00b0 8'E., on the road from Kunch to Punchh in the Jhansi district. The village had in 1901 a population of 660 persons, mainly consisting of Lodhis, Brahmans and Chamars, and contains an old ruined fort, which is now nazul property. Formerly a police station was maintained here, but this has now given place to an outpost only. Sunaya lies on the extreme boundary of the district about seven miles from Kunch, and has an aided school.\n\nUMRI, Tahsil Jalaun.\n\nA large village lying in 26\u00b0 20' N., and 79\u00b0 16' E., on the unmetalled road from Jalaun to Jagamanpur: it is 14 miles distant from Jalaun, six miles from Jagamanpur, and seven miles from\nMadhogarh, with which it is connected by an unmetalled road. Though situated in the jagir of Jagamanpur, it contains a large secondary vernacular school, to which a boarding-house is attached, supported by the Government. The population, which was only 3,039 souls in 1872, has considerably increased and in 1901 amounted to 3,815 persons, chiefly consisting of Sengar Rajputs. There are the ruins of an old fort close to the village, which also has a post-office; but though it is a thriving place, there is no bazar, and the agricultural produce of the neighbourhood goes chiefly to Madhogarh for export.\n\nUSARGAON, Tahsil Kalpi.\n\nA purely agricultural village in 26\u00b04' N. and 79\u00b0 43' E., close to the Jhansi-Cawnpore trunk road, and distant 15 miles from Orai and seven miles from Kalpi. The village had in 1901 a population of 1,153 persons, the principal Hindu caste being Koris; but it is one of the best agricultural estates in the tahsil, there being an extensive area of garden land all round the site cultivated by Kachhis and irrigated from earthen wells. Usurgaon contains a small school, and gives its name to a station on the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, which has but little traffic.\nGazetteer of Jalaun.\n\nAPPENDIX.\n## CONTENTS\n\n| Table |
