An officer stated that on the previous day he saw a procession, numbering about two hundred persons, proceeding along Waterloo-place, being accompanied with a barrow containing two effigies, several men beating trays and saucepans, thus causing considerable uproar.\n\nMr. Plowden: Did the effigies resemble any prominent personages? Witness: They were meant for local people. Mr. Plowden: They were local celebrities? (Laughter.) Witness: Yes, sir. He explained that the demonstration was the outcome of an action for slander in the Court of Queen's Bench, the effigies representing the successful parties to the suit. He desired them to disperse, and the effigies were taken into a yard. The crowd then congregated in front of the house occupied by the man and woman who were being subjected to this annoyance, and the display of angry feeling and throwing of stones at the front door greatly alarmed the inmates. Mr. Plowden: Was the prisoner one of the two hundred? Witness: Yes, sir. Mr. Plowden: One only here? The hundred and ninety-nine are not here. (Laughter.) The constable added that a fire was lit in the garden of the house opposite for the purpose of burning the effigies. He saw the prisoner carrying the woman effigy towards the fire, but on seeing him he threw it into his face and made off. The prisoner, in his defence, said he threw the effigy over his shoulder, but not with the intention of striking the officer. He called a woman, who created some amusement by stating that the effigies wore kid gloves and were filled with straw and a little hay. The constable said if it had been made of something else it might have injured him. (Laughter.) Mr. Plowden: I see; as it was made of straw it only tickled you. (Loud laughter.) I think there has been a great deal made out of this. I can't say the prisoner was not guilty of disorderly conduct, but it was of the most innocent kind. The prisoner was fined 2s. 6d., or three days.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3200807901.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 1200, "total-output-tokens": 551, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 2229, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
