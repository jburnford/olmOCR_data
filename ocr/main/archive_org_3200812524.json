Prosecutor, who lives in a cottage with a tarpaulin roof, said the money was the proceeds of the sale of his beer-house. He gave it to his daughter to keep safely, and she hid it in a canvas bag between the mattress and the bedding of her own bed. Police-constable Prime said he was at the Southend Railway-station the morning after the robbery, and although he knew nothing of the theft, he followed the boys as they looked suspicious. They made numerous purchases, and he tracked them home at South Benfleet, with the result that the boys admitted they had broken into prosecutor's house and stolen the money. The younger prisoner revealed where the cash had been hidden, and going with the constable dug up from underneath a hedge \u00a3137 in sovereigns. The lads got to know where the money was through being playmates with prosecutor's young son. \u00a340 of the money is still missing. The case was remanded.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3200812524.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 2074, "total-output-tokens": 287, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 1142, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
