The case excited unusual interest owing to various circumstances. The prisoner, who resided with his mother at Smallmoss, three miles from Falkirk, and who is most probably connected, was tried in September, 1857, along with another young man, at the Stirlingshire court, for breach of trust and assault. So far as he aided and abetted the frauds of the late Henry Salmon, manager of the branch of the Commercial bank at Falkirk, who, it may be remembered, on his extensive defalcations being discovered, took to flight, and eventually was found to have committed suicide in the courtyard of a Welsh inn. The two young men were not suspected of participation in the moneys appropriated by Salmon, but were nevertheless convicted of the offence charged, and were each sentenced to two years' imprisonment. The sensations made to the housekeeper, however, succeeded in procuring the liberation of both at or before the expiry of six months. Reid accordingly returned to his mother's house in April last, and resided there until the occurrence of the event which a second time brought him to the criminal bar. His mother's servant, Margaret Taylor, had become pregnant by him, and been so three or four months, and he, in conjunction with the deceased, Dr. Thomas Girdwood, used instruments it is said to cause her to abort. This criminal act proved fatal to the young woman the next day; the night of her death the doctor who gave her aid committed suicide by taking laudanum, while Reid himself fled, but was apprehended in Glasgow the following day.\n\nEvidence was gone into at great length, but it was of such a nature as to require in a public journal nothing more than a brief allusion to its principal features.\n\nThe mother of the deceased described the appearance of the painful illness which preceded death, which at first she concluded arose from a disturbance of natural causes. She afterwards learned from the dying girl that she was suffering under a miscarriage, that the prisoner was the father of the child, and that on the morning she had inflicted upon her serious injuries through the use of an instrument.\n\nThe mother of the prisoner proved much to a similar effect, and that on speaking to her son on the subject, he said it was not he that did it (the operation) but Tom Girdwood; that Dr. Myrtle knew all about it, and that the case was not so bad against him as the expected.\n\nDr. J. Girdwood, the father of Thomas Girdwood, deposed to speaking to his son about the catastrophe, and that the deceased had made a charge against him. He advised him to get out of the way as soon as possible, and he seemed stupefied by the statement made to him. Witness also saw the prisoner, who said to him, \"I used no instrument; if any instrument were introduced it must have been introduced by your son Tom.\" Witness said he did not believe that, but that did not alter the case so far as he, Reid, was concerned, and that for his part it was necessary for him to secure his safety by flight.\n\nEvidence was then given as to the suicide of young Dr. Girdwood immediately after the decease of the girl.\n\nThe medical evidence was to the effect that death was the result of the injury effected by the operation, but whether by a professional person or not, could not be spoken to.\n\nThe inquiry was then adjourned till next day.\n\nVERDICT AND SENTENCE.\n\nOn Thursday, after fifteen witnesses had been examined for the defence, the lord advocate addressed the jury for the prosecution, and the dean of faculty for the prisoner. The lord justice clerk summed up strongly against the prisoner. The jury sat about thirty-five minutes past five, and were absent about one hour, when they returned a verdict of \"Not guilty on the first charge of murder; and guilty on the second and third, amounting to culpable homicide.\" The prisoner was sentenced to ten years' penal servitude.\n\nThe prisoner maintained a stoical indifference throughout, except when his mother was giving her evidence, when his feelings were apparently much wrought upon.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3206204112.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 694, "total-output-tokens": 917, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 4194, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
