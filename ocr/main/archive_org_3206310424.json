The deceased and the prisoner, who is a native of Ballymote, were walking in the plantation, and a quarrel having taken place between them, the prisoner attacked the wretched girl in a savage manner, and inflicted frightful wounds upon her face and head with large stones, which were afterwards found on the spot by the police, covered with blood. Ferns was formerly an inmate of the Ballinasloe lunatic asylum; and it is stated that insanity will form the ground of his defence at the assizes. The prisoner made a statement to the following effect:\u2014\"I was irritated because she took a stone in her hand, with which she struck me on the finger, and a person being out of their mind, when they are irritated, they are worse than at other times. I was two years out of my mind in Sligo gaol and Ballinasloe. I had no store at the time the witness said I had.\"\u2014A coroner's jury have returned a verdict of wilful murder.\n\nHARVEST PROSPECTS.\u2014This week opened under most favourable appearances. The harsh wind which so long prevailed died away, and was succeeded by copious rain and close heat. Nothing could be better for vegetation than this change. The anxiety about the state of the crops will soon give way under the influence of the present weather. However, the spring is unusually late, and the great probability is the harvest will likewise be a late one. On the whole the accounts from the country are more cheering than otherwise. True, in some districts there appears to be an undue amount of despondency produced by the lateness of the season, but as it is an established fact that there is more than an average amount of land under tillage, it is premature to repine just yet.\n\nTwo SHOTS WERE FIRED AT A MR. H. G. STRONG, on the high road, near Kilmore, in the county of Tipperary, on Saturday last; and a reward of 100l. for the apprehension of the offender has been offered by the government.\n\nThe SETTLED ESTATES OF THE EARL OF KINGTON were put up for public sale on Monday in the incumbered estates court, and several of the lots adjourned for want of adequate biddings. Of those that were sold the greater number went at rates under twenty years' purchase.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3206310424.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 1108, "total-output-tokens": 591, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 2494, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
