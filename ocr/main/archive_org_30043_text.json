Nor has it been thought necessary to mark vowels as long in cases where mistakes in pronunciation were not likely to be made.\n\nConsonants\n\nMost Indian languages have different forms for a number of consonants, such as d, t, r, &c., marked in scientific works by the use of dots or italics. As the European ear distinguishes these with difficulty in ordinary pronunciation, it has been considered undesirable to embarrass the reader with them; and only two notes are required. In the first place, the Arabic k, a strong guttural, has been represented by k instead of q, which is often used. Secondly, it should be remarked that aspirated consonants are common; and, in particular, dh and th (except in Burma) never have the sound of th in 'this' or 'thin,' but should be pronounced as in 'woodhouse' and 'boathook.'\nBurmese Words\n\nBurmese and some of the languages on the frontier of China have the following special sounds:\n\naw has the vowel-sound in 'law.'\n\u014d and \u016b are pronounced as in German.\ngy is pronounced almost like j in 'jewel.'\nky is pronounced almost like ch in 'church.'\nth is pronounced in some cases as in 'this,' in some cases as in 'thin.'\nw after a consonant has the force of aw. Thus, ywa and pwe are disyllables, pronounced as if written yuwa and puwe.\n\nIt should also be noted that, whereas in Indian words the accent or stress is distributed almost equally on each syllable, in Burmese there is a tendency to throw special stress on the last syllable.\n\nGeneral\n\nThe names of some places\u2014e.g. Calcutta, Bombay, Lucknow, Cawnpore\u2014have obtained a popular fixity of spelling, while special forms have been officially prescribed for others. Names of persons are often spelt and pronounced differently in different parts of India; but the variations have been made as few as possible by assimilating forms almost alike, especially where a particular spelling has been generally adopted in English books.\n\nNotes on Money, Prices, Weights and Measures\n\nAs the currency of India is based upon the rupee, all statements with regard to money throughout the Gazetteer have necessarily been expressed in rupees, nor has it been found possible to add generally a conversion into sterling. Down to about 1873 the gold value of the rupee (containing 165 grains of pure silver) was approximately equal to 25s., or one-tenth of a \u00a3; and for that period it is easy to convert rupees into sterling by striking off the final cipher (Rs. 1,000 = \u00a3100). But after 1873, owing to the depreciation of silver as compared with gold throughout the world, there came a serious and progressive fall in the exchange, until at one time the gold value of the rupee dropped as low as 15s. In order to provide a remedy for the heavy loss caused to the Government of India in respect of its gold payments to be made in England, and also to relieve foreign trade and finance from the inconvenience due to constant and unforeseen fluctuations in exchange, it was resolved in 1893 to close the mints to the free coinage of silver, and thus force up the value of the rupee by restricting the circulation. The intention was to raise\nthe exchange value of the rupee to 15.4d., and then introduce a gold standard (though not necessarily a gold currency) at the rate of Rs. 15 = \u00a31. This policy has been completely successful. From 1899 onwards the value of the rupee has been maintained, with insignificant fluctuations, at the proposed rate of 15.4d.; and consequently since that date three rupees have been equivalent to two rupees before 1873.\n\nFor the intermediate period, between 1873 and 1899, it is manifestly impossible to adopt any fixed sterling value for a constantly changing rupee. But since 1899, if it is desired to convert rupees into sterling, not only must the final cipher be struck off (as before 1873), but also one-third must be subtracted from the result. Thus Rs. 1,000 = \u00a3100 - $\\frac{1}{3}$ = (about) \u00a367.\n\nAnother matter in connexion with the expression of money statements in terms of rupees requires to be explained. The method of numerical notation in India differs from that which prevails throughout Europe. Large numbers are not punctuated in hundreds of thousands and millions, but in lakhs and crores. A lakh is one hundred thousand (written out as 1,00,000), and a crore is one hundred lakhs or ten millions (written out as 1,00,00,000). Consequently, according to the exchange value of the rupee, a lakh of rupees (Rs. 1,00,000) may be read as the equivalent of \u00a310,000 before 1873, and as the equivalent of (about) \u00a36,667 after 1899; while a crore of rupees (Rs. 1,00,00,000) may similarly be read as the equivalent of \u00a31,000,000 before 1873, and as the equivalent of (about) \u00a3666,667 after 1899.\n\nFinally, it should be mentioned that the rupee is divided into 16 annas, a fraction commonly used for many purposes by both natives and Europeans. The anna was formerly reckoned as 1$\\frac{1}{2}$d.; it may now be considered as exactly corresponding to 1d. The anna is again subdivided into 12 pies.\n\nThe various systems of weights used in India combine uniformity of scale with immense variations in the weight of units. The scale used generally throughout Northern India, and less commonly in Madras and Bombay, may be thus expressed: one maund = 40 seers; one seer = 16 chittaks or 80 tolas. The actual weight of a seer varies greatly from District to District, and even from village to village; but in the standard system the tola is 180 grains Troy (the exact weight of the rupee), and the seer thus weighs 2.057 lb., and the maund 82-28 lb. This standard is used in official reports and throughout the Gazetteer.\n\nFor calculating retail prices, the universal custom in India is to express them in terms of seers to the rupee. Thus, when prices change, what varies is not the amount of money to be paid for the\nsame quantity, but the quantity to be obtained for the same amount of money. In other words, prices in India are quantity prices, not money prices. When the figure of quantity goes up, this of course means that the price has gone down, which is at first sight perplexing to an English reader. It may, however, be mentioned that quantity prices are not altogether unknown in England, especially at small shops, where pennyworths of many groceries can be bought. Eggs, likewise, are commonly sold at a varying number for the shilling.\n\nIf it be desired to convert quantity prices from Indian into English denominations without having recourse to money prices (which would often be misleading), the following scale may be adopted\u2014based upon the assumptions that a seer is exactly 2 lb., and that the value of the rupee remains constant at 1s. 4d.: 1 seer per rupee = (about) 3 lb. for 2s.; 2 seers per rupee = (about) 6 lb. for 2s.; and so on.\n\nThe name of the unit for square measurement in India generally is the bigha, which varies greatly in different parts of the country. But areas have always been expressed throughout the Gazetteer either in square miles or in acres.\n\nMAP\n\nCentral Provinces\nCentral Provinces.\u2014A Province under a Chief Commissioner, or Local Administration, situated in the centre of the peninsula, and comprising a large portion of the broad belt of hill and plateau country which separates the plains of Hindustan from the Deccan\\(^1\\). The Province lies between \\(17^\\circ 47'\\) and \\(24^\\circ 27'\\) N. and between \\(75^\\circ 57'\\) and \\(84^\\circ 24'\\) E. Its shape from north-west to south-east approximates to that of a rectangle, broader at the lower than at the upper extremity. The extreme length from north to south is 500 miles and the breadth from east to west also about 500 miles, while the area is 113,281 square miles, of which 82,093 are British territory and the remainder held by Feudatory chiefs. The Province is bounded on the north and north-west by the Central India States, and along a small strip of Saugor District by the United Provinces; on the west by the States of Bhopal and Indore, and by the Kh\u00e2ndesh District of Bombay; on the south by Berar, the Nizam's Dominions, and large zamindari estates of the Madras Presidency; and on the east by the last, and by the Tributary States of Bengal. The Central Provinces are thus enclosed on nearly every side by Native States, and are cut off geographically from other British Provinces.\n\nThe Province may be divided from north-west to south-east into three tracts of upland, alternating with two of plain country. In the north-west the Districts of Saugor and Damoh lie on the Vindhyan or M\u0101lw\u0101 plateau, the southern face of which rises almost sheer from the valley of\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Since October 1, 1903, Berar has been administered by the Chief Commissioner of the Central Provinces. But except where the contrary is expressly stated, this article treats of the Central Provinces without Berar. In 1903 the greater part of Sambalpur District, together with the five Feudatory States of K\u0101mra, Rair\u0101khol, Sonpur, Patn\u0101, and K\u0101l\u0101handi, were transferred to Bengal, while the five Feudatory States of Ch\u0101ng Bhak\u0101r, Kore\u0101, Surguj\u0101, Udaipur, and Jashpur were transferred from Bengal to the Central Provinces. The statistics of area and population have been altered to show the effect of these transfers, but the other statistics contained in this article are for the area of the Central Provinces as it stood in 1903-4 before the transfers.\nthe Narbad\u0101. The general elevation of this plateau varies from 1,500 to 2,000 feet. The highest part is that immediately overhanging the Narbad\u0101, and the general slope is to the north, the rivers of this area being tributaries of the Jumna and Ganges. The surface of the country is undulating, and broken by frequent low hills covered with a growth of poor and stunted forest. Another division consists of the long and narrow valley of the Narbad\u0101, walled in by the Vindhyan and S\u0101tpur\u0101 Hills to the north and south, and extending for a length of about 200 miles from Jubulpore to Handi\u0101, with an average width of twenty miles. The valley is situated to the south of the river, and is formed of deep alluvial deposits of extreme richness, excellently suited to the growth of wheat. Lofty and spreading mahua-trees stud the plain; and its surface is scoured by the numerous and rapid streams which, pouring down from the S\u0101tpur\u0101 Hills during the rainy season, have cut for themselves a passage to the Narbad\u0101 through the soft soil.\n\nSouth of the valley the S\u0101tpur\u0101 range or third division stretches across the Province, in the shape of a large triangle, its base or eastern face extending for 100 miles from Amarkantak to the S\u0101letekr\u012b hills in B\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t, and its sides running westward for about 400 miles, and gradually approaching each other till they terminate in two parallel ridges which bound on either side the narrow valley of the T\u0101pti river in Nim\u0101r. The greater part consists of an elevated plateau, in some parts merely a rugged mass of hills hurled together by volcanic action, in others a succession of bare stony ridges and narrow fertile valleys, in which the soil has been deposited by drainage. Steep slopes lead up to the summit of the plateau from the plain country on the north and south, which are traversed in all directions by narrow deep ravines, hollowed out by the action of the streams and rivers, and covered throughout their extent with forest. The general elevation of the plateau is 2,000 feet, but several of the peaks rise to 3,500 and a few to more than 4,000 feet. The S\u0101tpur\u0101s form the watershed of the plains lying north and south of them; and some of the more important rivers of the Province, the Narbad\u0101, T\u0101pti, Wardh\u0101, and Waingang\u0101, rise in these hills. Extending along the southern and eastern faces of the S\u0101tpur\u0101 range lies the fourth geographical division, the plain of N\u0101gpur, Chhattisgarh, and Sambalpur. It is broken in two places by strips of hilly country which run from the S\u0101tpur\u0101s in the north to the ranges enclosing it on the south, and is thus divided into three tracts presenting some dissimilar features. The N\u0101gpur plain, drained by the Wardh\u0101 and Waingang\u0101, contains towards the west the shallow black soil in which autumn crops, like cotton and the large millet, jow\u0101r, which do not require excessive moisture, can be successfully cultivated. This area, mainly comprised in the valley of the Wardh\u0101 river, is the great cotton-growing tract of the Province, and at present the most wealthy.\nThe eastern half of the N\u0101gpur plain, situated in the valley of the Waingang\u0101, possesses a heavier rainfall and is mainly a rice-growing tract. Its distinctive feature is marked by the numerous tanks which have been constructed for the irrigation of rice, and which have caused it to receive the name of the 'lake country' of N\u0101gpur. To the east of the N\u0101gpur plain, separated from it by a belt of hilly country, lies the great plain of Chhatt\u012bsgarh, comprising the open country of Raipur and Bilaspur Districts, and forming the upper basin of the Mah\u0101n\u0101d\u012b river. The Mah\u0101n\u0101d\u012b flows through the southern portion of the plain, skirting the hills which border it to the south, while its great tributary the Seon\u0101th brings to it the drainage of Raipur. Along the north the S\u0101tpur\u0101 range overlooks the low country, the surface of which is an expanse of small embanked rice-fields, sometimes fifty to an acre, separated by ridges of uncultivable gravel. Except for these undulations the level of the plain is generally unbroken; and over large areas there are few trees other than the mango groves adjoining the more important of the frequent clusters of mud-roofed huts which form a Chhatt\u012bsgarh village.\n\nTo the east of Chhatt\u012bsgarh lies the plain which forms the middle basin of the Mah\u0101n\u0101d\u012b, comprising Sambalpur District and the States of Sonpur, Patna, and K\u0101l\u0101handi. South of these level tracts lies another expanse of hill and plateau, comprised in the samind\u0101ri estate of Ch\u0101nda and the Chhatt\u012bsgarh Division, and the Bastar and K\u0101nker Feudatory chiefships, nearly touching the S\u0101tpur\u0101s on the north, and running south and east till in K\u0101l\u0101handi it merges into the Eastern Gh\u0101ts. This vast area, covering about 24,000 square miles, the greater part of which is dense forest with precipitous mountains and ravines, which formerly rendered it impervious to Hindu invasion or immigration, producing only on isolated stretches of cultivable land the poorest rains crops, and sparsely peopled by primitive Gonds and other forest tribes, was probably until a comparatively short time ago the wildest and least known part of the whole peninsula. In recent years it has been opened up in all directions by good roads, constructed under Government supervision from the funds of the estates through which they pass.\n\nWith the exception of the small Vindhyan plateau, the rivers of which flow north to Hindust\u0101n, and the narrow valley of the T\u0101pti in Nim\u0101r, practically the whole of the Central Provinces lies in the catchment basin of three rivers\u2014the Narbad\u0101, the God\u0101vari, and the Mah\u0101n\u0101d\u012b. The God\u0101vari itself, however, only skirts the southwestern border of Ch\u0101nda District for a short distance; and it is to its tributaries, the Pr\u0101nhita, formed by the junction of the Ward\u0101 and Waingang\u0101, and the Indr\u0101vati and other rivers from Bastar, that the important position of this river in the drainage system of the Province\n\n1 This area, comprising Sambalpur District and five adjoining Feudatory States, was transferred to Bengal in 1905.\nis due. Of the rivers a larger proportion of whose course lies in the Province, the Narbad\u0101, Mah\u0101nadi, Wardh\u0101, and Waingang\u0101 are the chief, all of these having a length of some hundreds of miles within its limits. They resemble each other in that their sources and the greater part of their catchment basins lie at a considerable elevation above the sea; and owing to the rapid fall of level, they have cut for themselves deep beds many feet below the surface of the country which they drain. In the rainy season they become swift torrents; but when dry weather sets in they rapidly dwindle to a chain of stagnant pools, connected by an insignificant streamlet trickling over masses of rock or meandering through broad wastes of sand.\n\nThough the scenery is on too small a scale to compare in sublimity with that of the Him\u0101layas, it is on the other hand as far removed from the monotony of the plains of Hindust\u0101n. The recurring contrast of woodland and tillage and the alternation of hill and valley, wood and river, cannot but be grateful to eyes fatigued by the sameness of dusty Indian plains. In the Narbad\u0101 valley during the pleasant winter months the eye may range over miles of green corn land, broken by low black boundary ridges or twisting footpaths. The horizon is bounded on either side by hill ranges which seem to rise abruptly from the plain; but on coming nearer to them, the heavy green of their slopes is found to be divided from the softer hues of the young wheat by broad belts of gravelly soil, carpeted with short sward and dotted with noble trees, recalling the appearance of an English park. On the S\u0101tpur\u0101s, the high and abrupt hills\u2014clothed from summit to base with forest, and seamed by the deep courses of the streams, up which the roads twist and turn, disclosing to the traveller here and there a glimpse of the cultivated plain stretching far beneath him, and the plateau with its rolling steppes of basalt alternating with little valleys cultivated like gardens\u2014present a variety of scenery not less attractive. But except at one period of the year the velvety freshness of an English landscape is wanting. During the hot months, the plains lying baked and scorched by the dry heat are as lifeless as a moor under a black frost. Even in the winter, though the wheat-growing tracts retain their freshness of appearance, the rice-fields quickly harden into an expanse of bare yellow stubble. But with the breaking of the monsoon all is changed. The abundant growth of vegetation, in an atmosphere like a hothouse, is so rapid as almost to be imagined perceptible; and the new foliage, clothed in the softest tints of green and glittering with rain-drops, covers the whole surface of a country which a month earlier seemed little better than an arid desert. Nor is the aspect less beautiful in September, when, from some such point as the hill overlooking the Mah\u0101nadi at Sambalpur, can be seen miles of continuous fields heavy with irrigated rice, the ripening ears of dark green or light yellow\nchanging in hue with the passing shadows of the clouds, while in the background wooded hills covered with darker coloured foliage fringe the horizon, and in the clear atmosphere of this season appear to be less than half their real distance away.\n\nThe tortuous gorge of white marble through which the Narbada winds with a deep silent course is now well-known to Indian tourists, but many spots hidden away in corners of little-travelled Districts are as well worthy of a visit. At Amarkantak, where the eastern hills reach their culminating point in a country so rugged and difficult that until fifty years ago scarcely a single European traveller had visited it, the sources of the sacred Narbad\u0101 are guarded by a little colony of priests who have reared their temples amid the solitary forests; westwards the caves and wild gorges of the Mah\u0101deo hills are sanctified and made the goal of pilgrims, as the scene where Siva formerly made himself manifest to his worshippers. The group of temples at Muktagiri in Betul, though selected by Fergusson as a type of Jain architecture, owe their reputation rather to their picturesque position in a wooded valley at the foot of a waterfall, than to any special degree of art or taste displayed in their construction. And many similar instances could be given.\n\n1 The six geological formations occurring in the Central Provinces may be arranged in the following order: Alluvium, the Deccan trap, the Gondwana system, the Vindhyan system, the Transition system, and the Gneissic system. The valley of the Narbad\u0101 from Jubbulpore to Harda is a great alluvial flat, chiefly composed of a stiff reddish, yellowish, or brownish clay, with intercalated bands of sand and gravel. The thickness of the clay seldom exceeds 100 feet, but a boring made near Gadarwara attained a depth of 491 feet without reaching the base of the alluvial deposits. The deposits have yielded fossils consisting of shells and the bones of both extinct and existing animals, such as the elephant, rhinoceros, and hippopotamus. The only trace of man hitherto found in them consists of a chipped stone scraper or hatchet made of Vindhyan quartzite, unearthed eight miles north of Gadarwara.\n\nThe basaltic or volcanic rocks known as the Deccan trap cover a large area in the Central Provinces, occupying the greater portion of the Districts of Saugor, Jubbulpore, Mandla, Seoni, Chhindwara, Nimar, Nagpur, and Wardha. They are horizontally stratified; and, between layers of the igneous rock, sedimentary beds containing numerous fresh-water fossils are found, showing that between the successive lava-flows sufficient epochs of time elapsed to allow life to appear again on the surface. The region covered by the volcanic rocks consists usually of undulating plains, divided from each other by\n\n1 From a note by Mr. Bose of the Geological Survey.\nflat-topped ranges of hills. The hill-sides are marked by conspicuous terraces, due to the outcrop of the harder basaltic strata, or of those beds which best resist the disintegrating influences of exposure. Distinguishing features of the trap area are the prevalence of long grass and the paucity of large trees, and the circumstance that almost all bushes and trees are deciduous. The black cotton soil found throughout this tract is believed to have been formed by the denudation of basalt rock, combined with the deposit of vegetable matter.\n\nThe Gondwana system corresponds to the marine older and middle mesozoic, and perhaps the upper palaeozoic formations of other countries, and is chiefly composed of sandstones and shales, which appear to have been deposited in fresh water and probably by rivers. As a general rule, these rocks occupy basin-shaped depressions in the older formations, which sometimes correspond to the existing river valleys. Remains of animals are rare, and the few which have hitherto been found belong chiefly to the lower vertebrate classes of reptiles, amphibians, and fishes. Plant remains are more common, and evidence of several successive floras has been detected. The main areas of Gondwana rocks in the Central Provinces are in the S\u0101tpur\u0101 range, in the basin of the God\u0101vari in N\u0101gpur, Wardh\u0101, and Ch\u0101nda Districts, and in the Bil\u0101spur samind\u0101ris and some of the Feudatory States. The formation is divided into the Upper and Lower Gondw\u0101nas, according to the character of the fossils found in them; and each of these is further subdivided into groups, several of which occur in the Central Provinces, but cannot be separately described. The sandstone of the Pachmarhi hills belongs to the Mah\u0101deo group of Upper Gondw\u0101nas. The rocks consist chiefly of beds of coarse sandstone and conglomerate, marked with ferruginous bands and attaining a thickness of 10,000 feet. The sandstones form high ranges of hills and often weather into vertical scarps of great height, making conspicuous cliffs in the forest, and contrasting strongly with the black precipices of the Deccan trap and the rounded irregular masses of the more granitoid metamorphic rocks. Searcely any fossils have been found in these rocks. To the Gondwana formation also belongs the Bar\u0101kar group of the D\u0101muda series, which furnishes the coal found in Korb\u0101, the Taw\u0101 valley, Mohp\u0101ni, and the Wardh\u0101 valley.\n\nNext in point of age is the Vindhyan series, which consists principally of sandstones, shales, and limestones, and is divided into the Upper and Lower Vindhyans. The Upper Vindhyan rocks in Saugor and Damoh are composed of hard red masses of sandstone, with alternations of shale. There is only one important band of limestone. Extensive stretches of Lower Vindhyan rocks occur in Raipur, Bil\u0101spur, and Bastar; they are composed of quartzitic sandstone, superimposed by blue or purple limestone and shale. The Vindhyan rocks have not\nyielded any authenticated fossils, but it is improbable that their deposition was anterior to the existence of life.\n\nThe transition or sub-metamorphic formation is believed to be somewhat earlier than the Lower Vindhyan. Rocks belonging to this system, consisting of quartzite, hornstone breccia, and limestone, occur in the western portion of Hoshangabad near Handia and on the Moran river. Low hills of cherty limestone and breccia are also seen in Narsinghpur, and some strata are exposed in Jubbulpore. Transition rocks underlying the surface strata cover a large area in the Districts of Mandla, Bhandara, Balaghat, Raipur, and Bilaspur.\n\nGneissic or metamorphic rocks, the oldest known formation, cover large portions of the plateau Districts, and in the Nagpur and Chhattisgarh plains underlie the more recent formations.\n\nWhere not under cultivation, the Central Provinces are characterized by a deciduous, sometimes scrubby forest, often mixed with heavy woody climbers. In the extreme south-east is a belt of moist evergreen forest. Teak (Tectona grandis) is found over most of the area, while sal (Shorea robusta) disappears in the western Districts. Saj (Terminalia tomentosa) and bijasal (Pterocarpus Marsupium) are the trees next in importance. The principal bamboo is Dendrocalamus strictus. The tendu or ebony (Diospyros tomentosa), Indian redwood (Seymida febrifuga), girya or satin-wood (Chloroxylon Swietenia), shisham or rosewood (Dalbergia Sissoo), and kumar (Gmelina arborea) yield ornamental timbers. Tun or red cedar (Cedrela Toona) is found wild and is also cultivated. Sandal-wood (Santalum album) is not indigenous, but one or two small plantations have been started in Government forests. The semur or cotton-tree (Bombax malabaricum) is common, the cotton surrounding the seeds being used to stuff quilts and cushions. The harra (Terminalia Chebula) yields the myrabolams of commerce. Among trees conspicuous for their beautiful flowers may be mentioned the amaltas (Cassia Fistula), with long pendulous racemes of bright yellow resembling the laburnum; the gangal (Cochlospermum Gossypium), growing on the driest and stoniest slopes with large yellow flowers; the kachnar (Bauhinia variegata), with large blossoms of four white petals and one pink or variegated; and the dhak or palas (Butea frondosa), a very common and useful tree in both the forests and the open country, remarkable for its brilliant scarlet orange inflorescence appearing when the tree is quite leafless. Other trees with conspicuous flowers are the siris (Albizia Lebbeck), with greenish-yellow flowers, much cultivated in avenues and gardens; the graceful haldu (Adina cordifolia), with yellow blooms; the shrub siharu or harsinghar (Nyctanthes Arbor-tristis), with fragrant yellowish-white flowers used for garlands; the\n\n1 From notes by the Director of the Botanical Survey, and Mr. Lowrie of the Forest department.\nkusumb (Schleichera trijuga), with bright red leaves and flowers, appearing in the hot season; the tins\u0101 (Ougeinia dalbergioides), with trifoliate leaves and pale rose-coloured flowers; and the shrub dh\u016bvi (Woodfordia floribunda), with red flowers. Flowering herbaceous plants are few, and the most brilliant shows are found on the trees. Among small trees or shrubs growing in scrub jungle may be mentioned the ach\u0101r or chironi\u1e6d (Buchanania latifolia), the graceful aonla (Phyllanthus emblica), the dh\u0101mun (Grewia vestita), and species of Zizyphus, Flueggea, Gardenia, Carissa, and Wightia. Among creepers the large maul (Bauhinia vahlii), whose leaves are used for plates, and the Butea superba, with leaves and flowers resembling the pal\u0101s, are perhaps the best known.\n\nOf trees growing in the open country the most important and handsome is the mahu\u0101 (Bassia latifolia) with lofty spreading foliage, while the commonest is the bab\u012bl (Acacia arabica), which specially affects black cotton soils; others are the reunj\u0101 (Acacia leucophloea), the g\u016blar (Ficus glomerata), the karanj (Pongamia glabra), and the bhokar (Cordia myxa), with some of the trees already mentioned. Trees planted in the neighbourhood of villages are the fruit-bearing mango (Mangifera indica), j\u0101mun (Eugenia jambolana), tamarind (Tamarindus indica), wild plum (Zizyphus jujuba), and kovit or wood-apple (Feronia elephantum), with the sacred banyan (Ficus indica), pipal (Ficus religiosa), bel (Aegle marmelos), and nim (Melia azadirachta). The bastard date-palm (Phoenix sylvestris) is common in some localities, growing along the banks of streams, while the palmyra palm (Borassus flabellifer) is also found in the south.\n\nThe best grazing grasses are the well-known darbh or d\u016bb (Cynodon dactylon) sacred to Ganesh, which is scarce on black soils; kel or kail\u0101 (Andropogon annulatus); mus\u0101\u1e6d (Isilema wightii); dhadh\u0101ra (Isilema laxum), the last two being sweet-scented when freshly cut; gunari\u0101 or gunher\u012b (Anthistiria scandens), the high grass growing on the Baihar plateau; and kusal (Pollinia argentea), an excellent fodder grass when young. Among other grasses may be mentioned bab\u0113l or bh\u0101bar (Pollinia criopoda), used locally for rope-making and now largely employed in the manufacture of paper; kharr\u016b (Sorghum halepense), from which reed-pens are made; the khashhas grass (Andropogon squarrosus) and the well-known spear-grass (Andropogon contortus); Andropogon Schoenanthus, which yields the aromatic r\u016bsa oil; k\u0101ns (Saccharum spontaneum), the grass which is such an enemy to the wheat cultivator; and Panicum Crus-galli, growing round tanks and called the gift of God, as its seeds are gathered and eaten by the poorer classes.\n\n1 Owing to the extent of its forests, the Province possesses a comparatively rich variety of wild animals. The wild elephant is now found\n\n1 From notes by Dr. Quinn, Major Sutherland, I.M.S., Colonel Poynder, I.M.S., and Mr. Lowrie and Mr. Dunbar-Brander of the Forest department.\nonly in one or two of the eastern Feudatory States. The wild buffalo frequents the forests of the eastern and southern Districts, where the rainfall is heavy and swamps and marshes abound. In the rains he is an occasional visitor as far west as Mandl\u0101. The bison (Bos gaurus) is found in the east and south, and also on the S\u0101tpur\u0101 Hills, preferring usually the higher summits and steep slopes. He is the largest ox in the world, but does not attain to so great a size in the Central Provinces as in Burma. Lions have long been extinct, but it is recorded that a specimen was shot in Saugor in 1851. Tigers and the large and small varieties of leopard occur all over the Province, while the hunting leopard (Cyn\u00e6turus jubatus) is found in some localities, but is very scarce. The Indian or sloth bear (Melursus ursinus) is common, and the wolf is found in small numbers in some Districts. Packs of wild dogs infest the forests and are very destructive to game. Wild hog are very numerous in both forests and open country. The principal deer are the s\u0101mbar (Cervus unicolor) and chittal or spotted deer (Cervus axis), which haunt all the forests, the latter however only in the proximity of water. The b\u0101r\u0101singh\u0101 or swamp deer (Cervus duvauceli) is found in the sal forests of Mandl\u0101 and the eastern Districts, those of the west being probably too dry for it. The hog deer (Cervus porcinus) is stated to be found in the eastern Districts, but this requires confirmation; and the rib-faced or barking-deer (Cervulus muntjac) and the mouse deer (Tragulus meminna) are comparatively common, the last animal however not being a true deer. Of antelopes, the nilgai or 'blue bull' is found everywhere and the four-horned antelope (Tetracerus quadricornis) haunts scrub jungle; herds of 'black buck' roam across the black-soil plains of the trap country; chink\u0101ra or 'ravine deer' frequent rocky and waste ground in small parties.\n\nAmong game-birds the following may be mentioned, though the list is by no means exhaustive. The great Indian bustard is met in the open country in small numbers, and the lesser florican is common in the northern Districts. Peafowl and red and grey jungle-fowl are numerous, especially in bamboo forests, and the brown and painted spur-fowl are found throughout the Province, the former in large numbers. Several varieties of plover, painted and common sandgrouse, painted and grey partridge, and the black partridge in Saugor, the large grey quail, bush quail, rain quail, and button quail, the blue rock and green pigeon, and the imperial pigeon in the south of Ch\u0101nda are the other principal land game-birds. Of water-birds, flocks of demoiselle crane frequent the vicinity of rivers in the cold season. Duck are numerous on the tanks of the rice Districts, and snipe in the marshy ground surrounding them. The grey and the bar-headed goose visit the northern Districts in small numbers in the cold season, while the nukt\u0101 or black-backed goose is indigenous. The principal varieties of\nimmigrant ducks are the shoveller, mallard, gadwall, and pintail, the red-crested, red-headed, and white-eyed pochards, the tufted or golden-eye, the smew or white-headed merganser, the widgeon, which is somewhat rare, and the common teal and blue-winged or garganey teal, while the bronze-capped teal is reported from Damoh. The ruddy sheldrake or Brahmani and spot-billed duck and the whistling and cotton teal are indigenous. The pintail, fantail, jack, and painted snipe are all fairly common, the last being indigenous.\n\nThe principal river fish are the mahseer (Barbus tor), the chilwa (Chela argentea), the Indian trout (Barilius bola), the gunch (Bagarius yarrellii), the Carnatic carp (Barbus carnaticus), the Indian gudgeon (Gottis gyuris), and the fresh-water shark (Wallago attu), which is common in both rivers and tanks. Of fish found principally in tanks the rohi (Labeo rohita), the kalbans (Labeo calbasu), the murrel (Ophiocephalus striatus and gachua), and the olive carp (Barbus chrysopoma) are the most important.\n\nAs regards climate the Districts of the Central Provinces fall into two main divisions. Saugor and Damoh on the Vindhyan plateau, Jubbulpore at the head of the Narbad\u0101 valley, and Mandla, Seoni, Betul, and Chhindw\u0101ra on the S\u0101tpur\u0101 uplands enjoy a distinctly lower average temperature than the rest of the Province. This difference is partly to be attributed to the greater elevation of these Districts, and also in the case of Saugor, Damoh, and Jubbulpore to the fact that they receive the westerly winds which blow across Northern India during most of the dry season, but which do not come south of the S\u0101tpur\u0101 range. Taking N\u0101gpur and Jubbulpore as typical examples, the mean difference of temperature in favour of the latter reaches a maximum of 7\u00b0 during January, February, and March. It falls to 6\u00b0 in December, 5\u00b0 in November, 4\u00b0 in April and October, and 3\u00b0 in May, while during the four months of the monsoon the variation is only about a degree. The main difference between the climates of the two places is in the cold season, when Jubbulpore has a considerably lower temperature, while in the summer the heat does not become oppressive until the middle of April, or a month later than in N\u0101gpur. Jubbulpore and the Vindhyan and S\u0101tpur\u0101 Districts all experience slight frosts which sometimes do considerable damage to the spring crops, but ice is seldom seen except in the interior of Mandla and occasionally in other Districts of the S\u0101tpur\u0101 plateau. Excluding those already mentioned, the climate of the remaining eleven Districts does not differ materially from that of N\u0101gpur, except that Narsinghpur and Hoshang\u0101bd in the Narbad\u0101 valley enjoy a lower temperature in the winter months, as they participate in the cold winds which are prevalent north of the S\u0101tpur\u0101 range. The Chhattisgarh Districts are very slightly cooler than N\u0101gpur. The mean temperature at N\u0101gpur in January is 70\u00b0, varying between 83\u00b0 and\n56\u00b0; in May 96\u00b0, varying between 109\u00b0 and 82\u00b0; and in July 82\u00b0, varying between 88\u00b0 and 75\u00b0. When the rains have properly set in, the mean temperature falls by 14\u00b0, and the fact that this season is not unpleasantly hot constitutes the great advantage of the climate. The variation in temperature is much lower during the rains than at any other season. The maximum shade temperature recorded in the Central Provinces is 110\u00b0 at Chand\u0101, and the minimum 30\u00b0 at Pachmarhi.\n\nThe annual rainfall of the Province averages 47 inches, varying from 32 inches in Nim\u0101r to 62 in B\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t. Pachmarhi with 77 inches is the station having the highest record. The mean for Ch\u0101nda, Bhanda, B\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t, and the three Chhattisgarh Districts, where rice is the principal crop, is 55 inches. Mand\u0101, Damoh, and the three Narbad\u0101 valley Districts receive 50 inches or more, and the other Districts under 50 inches. Of the annual Provincial total, 34 inches are received during the months of June, July, and August, more than 10 inches during September and October, and about 3 inches in the other seven months. The bulk of the rainfall is received from the Arabian Sea current of the south-west monsoon, but cyclonic storms advancing from the Bay of Bengal also give rain to the rice Districts in the east. The normal date of the breaking of the monsoon in the Central Provinces is June 10, while the rainfall caused by the advance of the south-west monsoon usually ceases in the second or third week of October. During November and December isolated falls are received from the retreating current of the south-west monsoon, but these are usually lighter in the Central Provinces than in Northern India. In January and February slight storms may occur advancing from the north-west, and are somewhat more frequent in the north than in the south of the Province. Any rain which may be received during the hot-season months is as a rule due to purely local conditions, masses of hot air being raised by the action of the wind to a sufficient height to produce condensation. About an inch of rain only is, as a rule, received during the hot season. During the last 36 years the average rainfall of the Province has five times been below 40 inches, but the harvests are dependent rather on a favourable distribution than on the total amount received. Hailstorms sometimes occur in the cold-season months, particularly in the northern Districts.\n\nOver great part of the Central Provinces the dawn of the epoch of authentic history may be placed at a period not much more than three centuries ago. To the people of Northern India it was known as Gondw\u0101na, an unexplored country of inaccessible mountains and impenetrable forests, inhabited by the savage tribes of Gonds from whom it took its name. The Musalm\u0101n expeditions organized for the invasion of the Deccan thus ordinarily left the forests of Gondw\u0101na to the east, and traversed the Narbad\u0101\nvalley through the pass commanded by the famous hill fort of Asirgarh. But Gondw\u0101na was not entirely outside the range of adventurous exploration in the early heroic ages of Hinduism. The R\u0101m\u0101yana represents R\u0101ma as traversing the forest of Dandaka, extending from the Jumna to the God\u0101vari, on his way to the hermitage of Sutikshn\u0101 at R\u0101mt\u0113k near N\u0101gpur. In the course of centuries a number of R\u0101jput principalities were established, and a considerable portion of the open country was subjected to their authority. Our knowledge of these is mainly derived from coins, a few inscriptions on copper or stone, the ruins of some ancient cities, and incidental statements in the ballads of R\u0101jput annalists. The existence of one of Asoka's rock edicts at R\u016bpn\u0101th in Jubbulpore proves that his empire embraced this portion of the Central Provinces. Inscriptions at Eran in Saugor District in the fourth and fifth centuries A.D. show that Eran and the surrounding country were included in the dominions of the great Gupta dynasty of Magadha, and shortly after fell under the rule of the White Hun Toram\u0101na. From certain inscriptions found in Seoni and the Ajanta caves, it has been concluded that the V\u0101k\u0101taka dynasty was ruling over the S\u0101tpur\u0101 plateau and the N\u0101gpur plain from the third century A.D., the name of the perhaps semi-mythical hero who founded it being given as Vindhy\u0101sakti. The capital of these princes is supposed to have been at Bh\u0101ndak in Ch\u0101nda, in ancient times a considerable town. A portion of the N\u0101gpur plain, comprising N\u0101gpur and Wardh\u0101 Districts, belonged to the old Hindu kingdom of Vidarbha (Ber\u0101r), which was in existence during the second century B.C.; and these Districts subsequently passed successively to the Andhra dynasty of the Telugu country (A.D. 113) and the Rashtrak\u016bta R\u0101jputs of the Deccan (A.D. 750-1087). In the north of the Province the Kalachuri or Chedi dynasty of Haihaya R\u0101jputs ruled over the upper valley of the Narbad\u0101, with their capital at Tripura or Karanbel, where the village of Tewar now stands near Jubbulpore. They used a special era in dating their inscriptions, which points to the establishment of their power in the third century A.D.; but nothing is known of the line before the ninth century, and it is last referred to in an inscription dated 1181. From the ninth to the twelfth centuries Saugor and Damoh were probably included in the territories of the Chandel R\u0101jput princes of Mah\u014dba. At about the same period the present fortress of Asirgarh was held by Chauhan R\u0101jputs. The Param\u0101ra kingdom of M\u0101lw\u0101 may have extended over the western part of the Narbad\u0101 valley between the eleventh and the thirteenth centuries; and an inscription found at N\u0101gpur and dated 1104-5 shows that at least one Param\u0101ra king, Lakshman Deva, included the N\u0101gpur plain within the circle of his dominions. In Chhatt\u012bsgarh another Haihaya R\u0101jput dynasty, perhaps akin to the rulers of Chedi, established itself\nat Ratanpur, and extended its authority over the greater part of the territory included in the present Districts of Raipur and Bilaspur.\n\nThe inscriptions carry us down to the eleventh or twelfth century, after which there is a blank until the rise of the Gond powers in the fifteenth or sixteenth. The earliest Gond kingdom to emerge into prominence was that of Kherla near Betul. It first appears in 1398, when Narsingh Rai, Raj\u0101 of Kherla, is said by Firishta to have had great wealth and power, being possessed of all the hills of Gondwana and other countries. He took part in the wars between the Bahmani kings and those of Malwa and Khandaesh. His territories were finally invaded by Hoshang Shah, king of Malwa, and Narsingh Rai was defeated and slain at the head of an army of 50,000 men, a large booty, including eighty-four elephants, falling to the victors. In the sixteenth century Sangram Sah, the forty-seventh Raj\u0101 of the Gond line of Garha-Mandla, issuing from the Mandla highlands, extended his dominion over fifty-two garhs or districts, comprising Saugor, Damoh, and possibly Bhopal, the Narbada valley, and Mandla and Seoni on the Satpura highlands. The Mandla dynasty is believed to have commenced about A.D. 664 with the accession of Jadho Rai, a Rajput adventurer, who entered the service of an old Gond chieftain, married his daughter, and succeeded him on the throne. But it remained a petty local chiefship until Sangram Sah's accession in 1480. About two hundred years after Sangram Sah's time, Bakht Buland, the chief of a Gond principality with its head-quarters at Deogarh in Chhindwara, proceeded to Delhi, and appreciating the advantages of the civilization which he there witnessed determined to set about the development of his own territories. To this end he invited Hindu artificers and husbandmen to settle in the plain country and founded the city of Nagpur, to which his successor removed the capital. The Deogarh kingdom extended over the modern Districts of Betul, Chhindwara, Nagpur, and portions of Seoni, Bhandara, and Balaghat. In the south of the Province the walled town of Chanda was the seat of another dynasty which also came into prominence in the sixteenth century, when one of its princes, Babaji Ballal Shah, is stated to have visited Delhi and to have held the position of an independent prince with an army of 1,000 cavalry and 40,000 infantry. The Chanda territories included most of that District and a portion at least of Berar, as their device of a winged lion has been found on the walls of Gawilgarh, a stronghold which controlled these lowlands. Thus for a certain period the simultaneous dominion of the three houses of Garha-Mandla, Deogarh, and Chanda united almost the whole of Gondwana under the sway of aboriginal princes. Their subjection to the Mughal emperors was scarcely more than nominal. Though Garha was included in the lists of Akbar's possessions as a subdivision of\nhis S\u016bbah of M\u0101lw\u0101, its chiefs were practically so far from the ken of the Mughal court that, except on occasions of disputed succession or other difficulties, their history runs in a channel of its own, unaffected by the imperial policy. And the princes of Ch\u0101nda and Deogarh, after their first submission to Delhi, seem to have been practically even more independent than their northern neighbour.\n\nMuhammadan conquest penetrated, however, to the north-western portion of the Province during the reign of Sangr\u0101m S\u0101h's successor, whose widow Durg\u0101vati was defeated and killed by a Mughal general in 1564. A S\u016bbah was established at Handi\u0101, which included the western part of Hoshang\u0101b\u0101d; Saugor, Damoh, and Bhop\u0101l were also occupied during the sixteenth century, and a fort and garrison were maintained at Dh\u0101moni in the north of Saugor. Nim\u0101r formed no part of Gondw\u0101na, and had for the two preceding centuries been included in the F\u0101r\u016bki kingdom of Kh\u0101ndesh, when in 1600 Akbar captured the fortress of Asirgarh from the last of the F\u0101r\u016bki kings and annexed Kh\u0101ndesh. At a later period when Ber\u0101r also had become a Mughal province, Asht\u012b and Paun\u0101r in Wardh\u0101 and Kherl\u0101 in Bet\u016bl were the head-quarters of Muhammadan officers during the reign of Jah\u0101ng\u012br. The Mughal empire included therefore a strip along the western border of the Province, while the centre was occupied by the Gond kingdoms, and in Chhatt\u012bsgarh the old Haihaiyansi R\u0101jput dynasty remained in power.\n\nThe outlying territories of the Gond R\u0101j\u0101s seem to have been distributed among feudatory chiefs, paying a trifling revenue, but bound to attend upon the prince at his capital, with a stipulated number of troops, whenever their services were required. The princes, like the people, were of an easy, unambitious disposition, rarely seeking foreign conquests after their first establishment, and anxious only to stave off by concessions the evil day of dissolution. Under their uneventful sway, the country over which they ruled prospered, while with a liberal policy they invited Hindu immigrants from the north, and entrusted to them the reclamation of the rich land in the Narbad\u0101 valley and N\u0101gpur plain. The group of semi-barbaric chieftains and their retainers, who constituted the fighting strength of a Gond state, possessed only an insignificant power of resistance to anything approaching the character of an organized force. The existence of the Muhammadan empire probably contributed to their stability, the Mughal from his distant court at Agra being content with obtaining from the lords of these rugged hills the nominal submission which was sufficient to prevent any break in the continuity of his vast dominions. But when on the ruins of the empire arose the predatory Mar\u0101th\u0101 and Bundel\u0101 powers who knew no such forbearance, while at the same time the increased wealth of the country had made it worth coveting, the Gonds succumbed almost without a struggle.\nDuring the seventeenth century Chhatars\u0101l, the well-known Bundelk\u0101 R\u0101jput chief, wrested a part of the Vindhyan plateau and the Narbad\u0101 valley from the Mandl\u0101 territories, only himself to lose them shortly afterwards to a stronger power. The first invasion of Bundelkhand by the forces of the Peshw\u0101 took place in 1733, and two years afterwards commenced the rule of the Mar\u0101th\u0101 Pandits of Saugor. In 1742 the Peshw\u0101 advanced to Mandl\u0101 and exacted the tribute of chauth or one-fourth of the revenue, amounting to four lakhs of rupees. From this time the Mandl\u0101 kingdom lay at the mercy of the Mar\u0101th\u0101s, by whom it was finally extinguished in 1781 after a duration of three centuries from the time of Sangr\u0101m S\u0101h. The fall of the Deogarh and Ch\u0101nda kingdoms was even more rapid. On the death of Ch\u0101nd Sultan, successor of Bakht Buland, in 1739, disputes as to the succession led to the intervention of Raghuj\u012b Bhonsla of Ber\u0101r. In 1743 he established himself at N\u0101gpur, reducing the Gond king to the position of a nominal sovereign, and between that year and 1751 effected the conquest of the Deogarh territories, Ch\u0101nda and Chhattisgarh. Ratanpur, the capital of the Haihaivansi kingdom, had capitulated without a blow in 1741 on the advance of the Mar\u0101th\u0101 general Bh\u0101skar Pant; and four years later, with the deposition of the last R\u0101j\u0101, a R\u0101jput dynasty, whose annals go back almost to the commencement of the Christian era, ignominiously ended. In 1749 Raghuj\u012b Bhonsla made a raid on the Carnatic, and immediately afterwards commenced a series of expeditions to Bengal, which terminated after a contest of ten years in the acquisition by the Mar\u0101th\u0101s of Cuttack and the promise of twelve lakhs annually from Ali Vardi Kh\u0101n as the chauth of Bengal. Raghuj\u012b I died in 1755, and the N\u0101gpur kingdom continued to expand under his successors. By the concession of a nominal authority to the Gond R\u0101j\u0101 of Deogarh, who conferred the t\u012bka on the Bhonslas on their accession, and had the right of putting his seal to certain revenue papers, Raghuj\u012b had to his hand a pretext for disavowing, if expedient, the rights of the Peshw\u0101 as his overlord. In practice, however, reference was usually made to the Poona court in important matters, such as those affecting the succession; and in 1769 J\u0101noji, the son of Raghuj\u012b I, after being defeated by a combination of the Niz\u0101m and the Peshw\u0101, was forced to acknowledge the latter's supremacy, and to agree to attend him in person with a contingent of six thousand men whenever called upon, besides paying an annual tribute of five lakhs. In 1785 the next R\u0101j\u0101, Mudhoji, obtained the cession of Mandl\u0101 and the upper Narbad\u0101 valley from the Poona court in return for a payment of 27 lakhs, and this was followed by the acquisition of Hoshang\u0101b\u0101d and the greater part of Saugor and Damoh in 1796\u20138.\n\nThe N\u0101gpur kingdom was now at its greatest extent. Under Raghuj\u012b II, Mudhoji's successor, it included practically the whole of the present\nCentral Provinces and Berar, besides Orissa, and some of the Chota Nagpur States. The revenue of these territories was about a crore of rupees. Raghuji's army consisted of 18,000 horse and 25,000 infantry, of which 11,000 were regular battalions, besides 4,000 Arabs. His field artillery included about 90 pieces of ordnance. The military force was for the most part raised outside the limits of the State, the cavalry being recruited from the Deccan, while, besides the Arabs, adventurers from Northern India and Rajputana were enlisted in the infantry. Up to 1803 the Maratha administration was on the whole successful. The Bhonslas, at least the first four of them, were military chiefs with the habits of rough soldiers, connected by blood, and by constant familiar intercourse, with all their principal officers. Descended from the class of cultivators, they ever favoured and fostered that order, and though rapacious were seldom cruel to the people. Of Janoji, the successor of Raghuji I, it is recorded that the king did not spare himself, being referred to in the smallest as well as the greatest matters of state; nor did any inconvenience or delay to the public service arise from this system, for even when not sitting actually in Darbar the Raja was always accessible to any person who had business to propound to him.\n\nUp to 1803 the relations of the court of Nagpur with the British had been generally friendly; but in that year Raghuji II was induced to join Sindhia in an alliance against them. The confederate chiefs were decisively defeated at Assaye and Argaon; and by the Treaty of Deogaon Raghuji was obliged to cede Cuttack, Sambalpur, and a part of Berar, and to agree to the permanent appointment of a British Resident at his court. From this time Raghuji, nicknamed by his people the big Bania, threw off all restraint in his unwillingness to show a reduced front to the world. Not only did he rack-rent and screw the farming and cultivating classes, but he took advantage of the necessities which his own acts had created to lend them money at high interest. All revenue reports of those times teem with accounts of the cruel but ingenious processes by which the Maratha collectors slowly bled the people.\n\nThe period from 1803 to 1818 was perhaps the most disastrous through which the country has had to pass. On the death of Raghuji II in 1816, his son, an imbecile, was soon supplanted and murdered by the well-known Mudhoji, otherwise Appa Sahib. A treaty of alliance for the maintenance of a subsidiary force by the British was signed in this year. In 1817, on the outbreak of war between the British and the Peshwa, Appa Sahib threw off his cloak of friendship, and accepted an embassy and title from the Peshwa. His troops attacked the British, but were decisively repulsed at Sitabaldi, and subsequently compelled to evacuate Nagpur. As a result of these battles, the remaining portion\nof Berar was ceded to the Nizam of Hyderab\u0101d and the territories in the Narbad\u0101 valley to the British. Appa Sahib was reinstated on the throne, but shortly afterwards, intrigues being discovered, was deposed and forwarded towards Allahabad in custody. On the way, however, he made his escape and ultimately fled to the Punjab. A grandchild of Raghuji II was then placed on the throne; and the Nagpur territories were administered by the Resident, Sir Richard Jenkins, from 1818 to 1830, in which year the young ruler known as Raghuji III was allowed to assume the actual government. During this period the restoration of internal tranquillity under a strong rule, and moderate taxation, gave the sorely harassed country an opportunity to recover, and it attained a fair measure of prosperity. For the next twenty years the methods of administration introduced by Sir Richard Jenkins were broadly adhered to, and the government was fairly successful. Raghuji III died in 1853, and his territories were then declared to have lapsed to the paramount power. The Nagpur province, consisting of the present Nagpur Division, with Chhindw\u0101ra and Chattisgarh, was administered by a Commissioner under the Government of India until the formation of the Central Provinces in 1861.\n\nOf the northern Districts, those parts of Saugor and Damoh which still belonged to the Peshw\u0101 were ceded by him in 1817, and the remainder, with Mandl\u0101, Betul, Seoni, and the Narbad\u0101 valley, were obtained from Appa Sahib in 1818. In 1829 this area, with the designation of 'The Saugor and Nerbudda Territories,' was placed under the administration of an Agent to the Governor-General. On the constitution of the North-Western Provinces in 1835, the Saugor and Nerbudda Territories were included in them. In 1842 occurred the Bundela rising, which originated in an attempt of two landholders in Saugor District to resist the execution of civil court decrees. They killed a number of police, and being joined by some Gond chiefs burnt and plundered several towns. Order was not restored until the following year, and in consequence of these disturbances the Saugor and Nerbudda Territories were again placed under the political control of an Agent to the Governor-General. This arrangement, however, was not found to be satisfactory, and they were restored to the North-Western Provinces in 1853. After the Mutiny the existence of these two isolated pieces of territory in the centre of India, too remote from the head-quarters of any Local Government to be efficiently administered, led to the determination to form a fresh Province, which was carried into effect in 1861.\n\nDuring the Mutiny of 1857 the northern Districts alone were seriously disturbed. The native regiments at Saugor rebelled, and that District and Damoh passed out of control, the British retaining only the fort and town of Saugor. The Jubbulpore regiment left the station in\nAugust, 1857; but a column of Madras troops from Kamptee arrived soon afterwards, and desultory operations were undertaken against the rebels in Jubbulpore and Saugor. Isolated disturbances occurred in Seoni, Mandla, and the Narbad\u0101 valley. Sir Hugh Rose marched through Saugor early in 1858, took the forts of R\u0101hatgarh and Garhakot\u0101, and defeated the insurgents in several engagements, after which order was rapidly restored. A rising had been concerted at N\u0101gpur by a regiment of irregular cavalry and the turbulent spirits in the city, but was defeated by the vigilance of the civil authorities, aided by Madras troops from Kamptee. Isolated disturbances occurred in the interior of Ch\u0101nda, Raipur, and Sambalpur, but were soon put down.\n\nThe archaeology of the Province is comparatively unimportant. The remains of the archaic period consist of a number of stone circles and a few cromlechs found in N\u0101gpur and Ch\u0101nda Districts, which are locally attributed to the Gaolis. One edict of Asoka exists at R\u016bpn\u0101th in Jubbulpore District, while four miles away at Tigw\u0101n is a temple resembling in plan and general construction that situated to the south of the great st\u016bpa of S\u0101nchi, and attributed to the third to fifth century A.D. The group of remains at Eran in Saugor District are of about the same age, but belong to the Gupta style, characterized by flat roofs, probably exemplifying the earliest period of architecture subsequent to the erection of porticoes outside rock-hewn caves. The extensive ruins at Sirpur in Raipur District also date from the same epoch, the temples found here constructed of brick being especially noticeable for the skill displayed in their moulding and ornament. The only Buddhist cave-temple is at Bh\u0101ndak in Ch\u0101nda, but it is not very ancient, and probably belongs to the declining period of Buddhism. The finest temples in the Province belong to the period of A.D. 700 to 1200, designated as the mediaeval Br\u0101hmamic. Good specimens of this style exist at M\u0101ndh\u0101ta, M\u0101rkand\u012b, Seorin\u0101r\u0101yan, and Bhoram Deo in the State of Kawardh\u0101, and are distinguished for their size and richness of ornament. The class of temples called Hem\u0101dpanti (see BOMBAY PRESIDENCY), built of large slabs of stone without mortar, are of about the same period, and are found in several Districts. They are locally attributed to a magician called Hem\u0101dpant, who is said to have built several hundred temples in pursuance of a vow, in a single night, with the aid of demons. The period following the twelfth century and the era of the Muhammadan conquest is represented by few structures worthy of mention. A large number of modern temples are found in Ratanpur, mainly constructed of brick and showing strong signs of Muhammadan art, especially in the use of radiating domes and arches. Some beautiful temples have recently been erected in N\u0101gpur, Jubbulpore, and Hoshang\u0101b\u0101d, modelled on old patterns, but most of them\nfollowing a hybrid style of architecture. Ancient and modern Jain temples are found in several localities in the northern Districts; the former are now almost all in ruins, but their sculptured fragments indicate that they were finely built. Of the modern temples the most important collection is at Kundalpur in Damoh, where there are more than fifty. The only remains of Muhammadan architecture of any value are at Burhanpur, and consist of two mosques belonging to the sixteenth century. They are plainly built, but produce a pleasing effect owing to the harmonious symmetry of their proportions. The Gonds have left only a few forts, palaces at Ramnagar and Garha of little or no architectural merit, the tombs of the kings of Chanda, which are plain and substantial buildings of heavy aspect, and the city walls of Chanda extending for a circuit of 5\u00bd miles and presenting a very picturesque appearance. The other remains deserving mention are the massive forts built by the Marathas, Bundelas, and other ruling dynasties in numerous localities, usually having inner and outer walls with large round towers at the corners and at intervals in the wall.\n\nA general Census of the Central Provinces has been held on five occasions\u2014in 1866, 1872, 1881, 1891, and 1901. The population enumerated was just over 9 millions in 1866 and 9\u00bd millions in 1872. In both years the Census was inaccurate in the remoter tracts, but the development of population was affected by the famine of 1869. In 1881 the population had risen to 11\u00bd millions, an increase of 25 per cent. on 1872. During the decade the Province had been rapidly recovering from the effects of famine, the seasons being prosperous, and the only checks to the natural increment being epidemics of cholera and small-pox in 1872, 1878, and 1879. A considerable proportion of the increase must, however, be attributed to better enumeration. The population in 1891 was nearly 13 millions, showing an increase of 12 per cent. since 1881. The decade was on the whole prosperous, though marked towards the end by some seasons of slight scarcity and high prices culminating in a very unhealthy year in 1889. In 1901 the population was something less than 12 millions, equivalent to a decrease of 8\u00b73 per cent. since 1891. This period was the most disastrous through which the Central Provinces have had to pass since the Maratha Wars of the beginning of the century. In 1897 and 1900 occurred two famines of the first magnitude, occasioned by complete failures of both harvests, and affecting nearly the whole area of the Province. In four other years there were partial failures of crops, and in seven out of ten years severe epidemics of cholera. Of the decrease, which exceeded 800,000 persons, between an eighth and a quarter is probably due to emigration to Assam and other Provinces, and the remainder to the effect of these calamities, which the utmost efforts of the Administration could only partially obviate.\nThe population of the Province in 1901 was 11,873,029. Since the Census the greater portion of Sambalpur District with five Feudatory States has been transferred to Bengal, while five other Feudatory States have been received from that Province, and it is proposed to transfer part of Chanda District to Madras. The corrected total of population is thus 10,847,325. The British Districts contain 9,216,185 persons, or 85 per cent. of the total, and the Feudatory States 1,631,140, or 15 per cent. The density is 96 persons per square mile, being 112 in British Districts and 52 in the Feudatory States. The plain of Chhattisgarh has the highest rural density in the Province with 170 persons, while some of the large zamindari estates in Chanda District contain only 10 persons to the square mile.\n\nThe Province contains 40,339 inhabited towns and villages, including 55 places with a population of 5,000 persons and upwards. Only one of these, Nagpur, has a population of more than 100,000; five, Jubbulpore, Saugor, Kamptee, Burhanpur, and Raipur, have more than 20,000; and fifteen between 10,000 and 20,000. The urban population has increased since 1881 by 29 per cent., and now forms 8 per cent. of the total. Its increase may be attributed to the growth of factories and other urban industries, the expansion of rail-borne traffic, the spread of education, and with it the formation of a wealthy and educated class in native society who prefer town life. The average number of persons to a village is 269, which is equivalent to 54 houses at the ordinary rate of 5 persons to a house. The ordinary village is smaller in the Central Provinces than in any part of British India except Burma. The villages are large in open and well-cultivated areas, but small in tracts of hill and forest.\n\nThe ages of the population in 1901 may be summarized as follows. About 26 per cent. were under 10 years old; 46 per cent. were under 20 years old; nearly 65 per cent. were under 30; nearly four-fifths under 40; and a little more than 4 per cent. were over 60. Some noticeable changes in the age constitution occurred between 1891 and 1901. In the former year the proportion of children under 10 was 30.7 per cent. of the whole population, as against 26.2 in the latter. The difference must be attributed to the decreased birth-rate and increased mortality of young children, which are the natural effects of bad seasons. On the other hand, at all the age periods between 10 and 40 there were larger numbers of persons in 1901, and the total percentage of population between these ages was 53.3, as against 48.5 in 1891 and 48.9 in 1881.\n\nAt the Census of 1901 the registration of vital statistics had not been extended to most of the zamindari estates in British territory, nor to the Feudatory States. The majority of the zamindaris have since been\n\n* The figures in this paragraph have been corrected on account of the transfer of Sambalpur.\nbrought under registration. The principal statistics of births and deaths are shown below:\n\n| Year | Population under registration | Ratio of registered births per 1,000 | Ratio of registered deaths per 1,000 |\n|------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| 1881 | 8,802,040                     | 41.25                               | 27.4                                |\n| 1891 | 9,501,401                     | 39.99                               | 33.98                               |\n| 1901 | 9,710,566                     | 28.83                               | 23.46                               |\n| 1904 | 9,770,567                     | 52.64                               | 30.61                               |\n\nDeaths per 1,000 from:\n\n- Cholera\n- Small-pox\n- Fever\n- Bowel complaints\n- Plague\n\nThe decennial birth-rate for the Province between 1881 and 1891 was 40.8, and between 1891 and 1901 35.7 per 1,000; the corresponding death-rates being 32.4 and 37.8 per 1,000. These rates are considerably below those deduced as normal for India in actuarial calculations based on the Census. But it may be noted that between 1881 and 1891 the population deduced from vital statistics differed from that shown in the Census by only 50,000. In 1901 the deduced population was greater than that enumerated in the Census by 450,000. The difference may be partly accounted for by emigration, but is mainly due to deficient reporting of deaths in famine years. In the decade ending 1891 the highest District birth-rate was 43.7 in Saugor, and the highest death-rate 39.1 in Narsinghpur. During the next ten years the highest birth-rate was 41.9 in Chhindwara, and the highest death-rate 46.4 in Nimar.\n\nOf the total number of deaths registered in twenty years ending 1901 more than 60 per cent. were returned as being from fever, the rates for the two decades being nearly equal. Fever includes, however, a variety of diseases which are inaccurately diagnosed. Cholera accounted for 5 per cent. of the total number of deaths between 1881 and 1891, and for 7 per cent. between 1891 and 1901. Severe epidemics occurred in 1885, 1889, 1891, 1892, 1896, 1897, and 1900, in each of which years more than 20,000 deaths were reported from this disease. The highest number reported was 75,000 in 1900, when there was great scarcity of water. The most severe epidemics of small-pox were in 1889 when 17,500 deaths were reported, and in 1888 with 10,700 deaths. Epidemics have generally occurred at intervals of from three to five years, and have lasted for two years. Plague made its appearance in the Province in 1898, and in each succeeding year has caused a small number of deaths. But 1903 witnessed the first serious epidemic, when 35,000 deaths were reported from this disease, severe outbreaks having occurred in several of the large towns of the Province. A similar epidemic occurred in 1904. The first small and isolated outbreaks were detected at once,\nand successfully stamped out by segregation and disinfection of houses; but since the disease has fairly established a foothold in the Province, compulsory measures have been abandoned, as being at once strongly opposed to the opinions of the people, and ineffectual to do more than slightly retard the progress of the disease. Infant mortality is usually severe in the Central Provinces, the deaths of children under five years of age amounting to about 40 per cent. of the total.\n\nIn 1901, 183,401 more females were enumerated than males, compared with an excess of 27,825 males in 1891. An examination of the statistics tends to show that women are constitutionally stronger and less liable to succumb to the effects of privation than men. A comparison of the variation in the proportion of the sexes with that of the increase and decrease of population in different units demonstrates that the largest increases in the proportion of women are generally found in those areas which have suffered most severely from famine.\n\nThe distribution of the population by sex and civil condition in British Districts is as follows:\n\n| Civil condition | 1891 | 1901 |\n|-----------------|------|------|\n|                 | Persons | Males | Females | Persons | Males | Females |\n| Unmarried       | 4,437,417 | 2,519,480 | 1,917,937 | 3,919,881 | 2,124,370 | 1,695,012 |\n| Married         | 5,311,265 | 2,630,220 | 2,671,036 | 4,751,836 | 2,124,326 | 2,427,510 |\n| Widowed         | 1,035,612 | 238,595 | 797,017 | 1,204,908 | 366,758 | 838,150 |\n| Total           | 10,784,294 | 5,397,304 | 5,386,990 | 9,876,646 | 4,855,984 | 5,020,662 |\n\nIn 1901, 47 per cent. of the males were unmarried, 47 per cent married, and 6 per cent. widowed. Of females 35 per cent. were unmarried, 48 per cent. married, and 17 per cent. widowed. The percentages of married and widowed are much larger, and those of unmarried much smaller, than in any European country. The joint family system prevails throughout all grades of society in the Central Provinces, but the members now generally separate on the death of a single common ancestor. Thus brothers live jointly during the lifetime of their father, but separate at his death, as far as household life is concerned, though trade or cultivation is frequently carried on jointly. The Mit\u0101kshar\u0101 law of inheritance is generally observed, but immigrants from other Provinces frequently adhere to their own law, the Mar\u0101th\u0101s especially following the Mah\u0101r\u0101shtra school.\n\nOf boys, 21 per cent. are married under 15 years of age and more than 50 per cent. under 20. A tendency has arisen among the higher castes to postpone the marriage of boys until their education has been completed. The age of marriage of girls is much earlier than that of boys, and 11 per cent. are married under 10 years of age. Between\nto and 15, about half the total number of Hindu girls are married, 20 per cent. of Animists, and 27 per cent. of Muhammadans. The majority of the remainder get married before 20. As a rule, no social stigma is incurred so long as a girl gets married before 12 or even a year or two older. Br\u0101hmans and other high castes now frequently keep their girls unmarried until this age, because, as the bridegroom is older, it is natural to wish that the bride should if possible be somewhat nearer his age. The castes in which infant marriage is most prevalent are Bani\u0101s and the higher grade of cultivators, as well as Mar\u0101th\u0101 Br\u0101hmans in the southern Districts. In some castes, families with a number of children occasionally celebrate two or three marriages at the same time in order to save expenditure; and on such occasions a baby six months old may be given in marriage. Instances occur in which children still in the womb are conditionally betrothed, provided they turn out to be of opposite sex. The actual age at which the marriage of girls under 12 is celebrated is of comparatively small importance, as they do not live with their husbands before they arrive at adolescence.\n\nMarriages are always arranged by the families of the parties, except among some of the Dravidian tribes, where girls do not marry until they are adult, and are allowed to select their own husbands. In such cases unchastity before marriage is said to be not uncommon. The marriage ceremony is elaborate, and presents considerable variation among different classes of the population. The essential portion of it is usually that the couple walk seven times round a sacred pole erected in the middle of the temporary shed in which marriages are always held, the bridegroom usually following in the footsteps of the bride for the first four perambulations, and the bride in those of the bridegroom for the last three. Br\u0101hmans perform the marriage ceremony of all the higher castes; but in the lower castes the s\u016bv\u0101sa or the husband of either the bridegroom's sister or his paternal aunt officiates as priest, his wife also performing certain minor ceremonies. Among the Jains marriage is little more than a civil contract. The celebration of marriages is the leading event of Hindu social life, and the sums expended on both sides are usually equivalent to several months' income of the families.\n\nThe returns of the Census of 1901 show 1,040 married women to every 1,000 married men. The vast majority of Hindus are content with a single wife, but except in the higher castes no special stigma attaches to the taking of a second. To members of the cultivating castes it is frequently advantageous to marry two wives, as one woman will look after the house while the other works in the fields. The practice is common among such castes as M\u0101lis, K\u0101chhis, and Kohl\u012bs, who grow flowers, vegetables, sugar-cane, and other irrigated crops entailing much spade work. Among the primitive tribes a man will marry as many wives as he can afford to purchase and keep, and\npolygamy is in their case an indication of wealth. Widow marriage is permitted except among a few of the higher castes. In many castes a considerable price has to be paid for a widow to her father's family. The custom of the levirate, by which the younger brother takes the widow of his elder brother to wife, is usually optional, but not binding on the woman in the Central Provinces.\n\nRegular divorce is allowed among all except those castes which do not permit widow marriage. In their case if a woman commits adultery she is finally expelled from her caste, and the husband is free to marry again. Divorce is usually permissible on the initiative of the wife only on the ground of the cruelty or impotence of the husband; but a husband may divorce his wife for any serious fault, such as adultery, incurable disease, culpable disobedience, or extravagance. If a married woman elopes with another man, he is required to repay to the husband the expenditure incurred by him on his wedding, and the divorce is then complete. Resort to the criminal law is unusual unless he refuses to do this, or is a personal enemy.\n\nThe diversity of the ethnical constitution of the Province can best be illustrated by a consideration of the statistics of language. The Bundeli dialect of Western Hindi is spoken on the Vindhyan plateau, in the lower Narbad\u0101 valley, and in Seoni and Chhindw\u0101ra, indicating that the population of this area immigrated from the north-west through Bundelkhand. The Bagheli dialect of Eastern Hindi is the vernacular of Jubbulpore and Mandl\u0101; and this fact may perhaps be taken to show a separate wave of immigration from Oudh or the territories adjoining it, possibly at a much earlier date, and during the predominance of the Chedi dynasty of Jubbulpore already alluded to. Chhatt\u012bsgarh\u012b is, as its name implies, a special dialect of Hindi spoken throughout Chhatt\u012bsgarh, and akin to the Oudh dialect. Its development probably dates from the rise into power of the Haihaiavansi dynasty of Ratanpur. In Bet\u016bl, Nim\u0101r, and part of Hoshang\u0101b\u0101d the local speech is the M\u0101lw\u012b dialect of R\u0101jput\u0101na, these areas having been colonized by settlers from Central India, probably in the fifteenth century with the invasion of Hoshang Sh\u0101h of M\u0101lw\u0101. Of the whole population, 15 per cent. speak Bundeli, 10 per cent. Bagheli, 27 per cent. Chhatt\u012bsgarh\u012b, and 5 per cent. R\u0101jasth\u0101n\u012b. If all these languages are grouped as Hindi, together with Urd\u016b (130,415) and some minor dialects, then 6,782,200 persons, or 63 per cent. of the population, are Hindi speakers. Mar\u0101th\u012b is the main vernacular of four Districts, Wardh\u0101, N\u0101gpur, Ch\u0101nda, and Bhand\u0101ra, and is also largely spoken in the southern tahsils of Nim\u0101r, Bet\u016bl, Chhindw\u0101ra, and B\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t. It is the language of 2,200,000 persons, or 20 per cent. of the population. Its distribution indicates the extent to which the country was colonized by immigration from the Deccan and Ber\u0101r under the Bhonsla dynasty.\nOriya was spoken by 1,600,000 persons, or 13\u00bd per cent. of the population in 1901, but the transfer of Sambalpur and the adjoining Feudatory States to Bengal has reduced this figure to 292,000. Rather more than 100,000 persons, mainly in the south of Chanda District, spoke Telugu in 1901. The cession of three taluks of Sironcha to Madras will diminish this number by nearly one-fifth. The only other languages of any importance are those of the primitive Dravidian or Munda tribes. They are now represented by 1,100,000 speakers, or rather more than 9 per cent. of the population. Of these, nearly 900,000 speak Gondi and 60,000 Korku. The numbers returned as speaking these languages represent only 40 per cent. of the total numbers of the tribes, and this fact indicates the extent to which they have abandoned their own speech and adopted the Aryan vernaculars current around them. The following table shows the languages spoken in British Districts in 1891 and 1901:\n\n| Languages spoken | 1891 | 1901 |\n|------------------|------|------|\n| Chief vernaculars of the Province | Hindi | 6,702,023 | 6,111,016 |\n| | Marathi | 2,118,614 | 2,106,872 |\n| | Oriya | 685,971 | 702,635 |\n| | Telugu | 101,311 | 93,856 |\n| Dravidian dialects | | 1,007,004 | 739,997 |\n| Munda dialects | | 101,750 | 74,305 |\n| Gipsy dialects | | 13,913 | 20,210 |\n| Other Asiatic languages | | 36,596 | 29,664 |\n| Non-Asiatic languages | | 7,112 | 7,991 |\n| **Total** | | **10,784,294** | **9,876,646** |\n\nThe Province has received successive waves of immigration from the territories adjoining it on all sides. In many castes endogamous divisions have grown up, separating the older and newer immigrants. Social position is here in inverse ratio to length of residence in the country, the earlier immigrants being suspected, probably with justice, of interbreeding with the non-Aryan tribes. Among the castes of high social rank, the minority only, and in the case of Rajputs an infinitesimal minority, are regarded as equals by their fellows at home. The population of the Central Provinces is in fact, as social institutions go in India, a new community, and like most new communities its pedigree will not stand too close a scrutiny. As in other agricultural countries, the possession of the land has until recently been the main factor in the determination of social position; and it is remarkable how closely the position of castes as landholders corresponds with their social gradation, and how extensively the ownership of property is concentrated in the higher castes. Brahmins, Rajputs, Banias, and Kayasths are the chief\nlandholders. Br\u0101hmans number nearly 400,000, R\u0101jputs 350,000, Bani\u0101s 130,000, and K\u0101yasthas 29,000. Of the cultivating castes, Ahirs form nearly 8 per cent. of the population, Kunb\u012bs 4 per cent., Kurmis 2\u00bd per cent., and Lodh\u012bs 2\u00bc per cent. A large proportion of Ahirs have abandoned their traditional occupation of tending cattle and taken to agriculture. Among other castes may be mentioned Mar\u0101th\u0101s, Kohlis, G\u016bjars, D\u0101ngis, and Kir\u0101rs. The Mar\u0101th\u0101s, D\u0101ngis, and Lodh\u012bs were formerly ruling castes. M\u0101lis and K\u0101chh\u012bs, the market gardeners of the community, form nearly 4 per cent. of the population. Two other castes may be mentioned as considerable landowners\u2014Telis or oil-pressers and Kal\u0101rs or liquor-sellers, with about 750 villages each. These castes were frequently money-lenders to the Gonds, before the arrival of the Bani\u0101s, and have thus acquired their property. The Telis constitute 6 per cent. of the population, but the large majority have abandoned their hereditary occupation and now engage in agriculture or trade. The aboriginal or forest tribes still form nearly a quarter of the whole population, being most numerous in the S\u0101tpur\u0101 Districts and the large samind\u0101ri estates and Feudatory chiefships in the east of the Province. Some of them are large proprietors, as the Gonds, Kawars, and Binjh\u0101ls. These are mainly comprised in the samind\u0101ri estates held on an impartible and inalienable tenure, but for which fact they would by this time have passed into the hands of money-lenders, as the samind\u0101rs are generally ignorant and improvident. The Gonds number nearly 2,000,000 persons, the Khonds 163,000, the Kawars 123,000, the Baig\u0101s (including Binjhw\u0101rs) nearly 100,000, and the Kork\u016bs 100,000. The impure castes form about a fifth of the total, and are generally the poorest and most depressed class, engaged in labour and weaving country cloth. But the Cham\u0101rs (740,000) own a few villages in Chhattisgarh and the Mah\u0101rs (620,000) a few in the N\u0101gpur country, while the Chhattisgarhi Cham\u0101rs are also largely tenants.\n\nThe following table gives the leading statistics of religion for the population of British Districts:\n\n|          | 1891       | 1901       |\n|----------|------------|------------|\n|          | Number of persons | Number of persons |\n| Hindus   | 8,831,199  | 8,171,211  |\n| Animists | 1,592,149  | 1,335,573  |\n| Musalm\u0101ns| 297,604    | 295,391    |\n| Jains    | 48,644     | 47,306     |\n| Christians| 12,979    | 24,809     |\n| Others   | 1,719      | 2,456      |\n| Total    | 10,784,294 | 9,876,646  |\nOf the total population of the Province, 9\u00be millions, or 82 per cent., are Hindus, and 1\u00be millions, or 14\u00bd per cent., Animists.

Parsis, Jews, Sikhs, and the members of the Arya Samaj number, severally, a few hundred persons or less.\n\nThe Hinduism of the Central Provinces is largely tinctured by nature and animal worship, and by the veneration of deified human beings. Even in the more advanced Districts there are usually a number of village gods, for the worship of whom a special priest belonging to the primitive tribes called Bhumka or Baiga is supported by contributions from the villagers. Khermata, the goddess of the earth or the village, Marhai Devi, the goddess of cholera, Sitala Devi, the goddess of smallpox, Nagdeo, the cobra, Bhainsa Sur, the buffalo, Dulha Deo, a young bridegroom who was killed by a tiger, Hardaul, a young Rajput prince who was poisoned by his brother on suspicion of loving his wife, and Bhilat, a deified cowherd, are the most common of these. Of the sects of Hinduism, only the Kabirpanthis and Satnamis need be mentioned; they represent respectively the revolt of the depressed castes of Gandas or weavers and Chamars or tanners against the tyranny of Brahmanism and the caste system. Both started with the fundamental ideals of the equality of all men, the abolition of caste, and the worship of one supreme God who required no idols or temples and therefore no Brahmins; but whereas the Kabirpanthis now admit caste and are thus scarcely to be distinguished from an ordinary Hindu sect, the Satnamis are still militant and have carried their opposition to the Hindu social system into their relations as tenants by refusing to pay rent to their Hindu landlords.\n\nOf the Christians, 4,920 are Europeans, 2,304 Eurasians, and 18,367 native Christians. The number of the latter has nearly trebled since 1891 as the result of missionary enterprise, the increase being partly due to the adoption of famine orphans. Missionary stations of various denominations exist in all Districts and some of the Feudatory States. The principal are the unsectarian American Mission known as the Disciples of Christ, who carry on work in Damoh, Bilaspur, and elsewhere; the United Free Church Mission in Nagpur, Bhandara, and Wardha; the Church of England Zanana Missions in Nagpur and Jubulpore, and the Church Missionary Society in Mandla; the Mission of the Friends Society at Hoshangabad; the German Evangelical Mission in Raipur; the Swedish Lutheran Mission in Betul and Chhindwara; the Methodist Mission in Balaghat; and the work of the Roman Catholic Church in Nagpur, Kamptee, Jubulpore, Pachmarhi, and Khandwa. The Central Provinces belong to the Anglican diocese of Nagpur, which embraces also Berar, Central India, and Rajputana. The greater part of the Province forms the Roman Catholic\ndiocese of Nagpur, but portions of it are included in those of Allahabad, Calcutta, and Vizagapatam, while the Nagpur diocese comprises also Berar and Hyderab\u0101d north of the God\u0101vari.\n\nThe Province is essentially agricultural, and the recent development of mining and factory industries, though important, has as yet exercised no appreciable effect on the returns of occupation. About 70 per cent. of the whole population are shown as supported by agriculture, while if to these are added more than 2\u00bd per cent. engaged in the training and care of animals, nearly all of whom are herdsmen, and nearly 3 per cent. dependent on general labour, the greater part of whom subsist mainly by agricultural labour, the proportion rises above 75 per cent. Of the agricultural population, tenants are the most important class, numbering over 4,000,000, while nearly 250,000 persons are landed proprietors. Labourers, including herdsmen, farm-servants, field and general labourers, number 3,000,000. Nearly 300,000 persons, or 2\u00bd per cent. of the population, are engaged in service, principally as barbers, indoor servants, washermen, water-carriers, and sweepers. About 600,000, or 5 per cent., manufacture, collect, and sell articles of food and drink, principally milk and butter, fish, flour, vegetable oil for food, grain, vegetables and fruits, betel-leaf, salt, and tobacco. This includes the very poor classes who grind flour, parch gram, and husk rice, numbering about 90,000 persons. Nearly 120,000 persons are engaged in retailing head-loads of grass, fuel, and cow-dung cakes. The cotton industry supports 400,000 persons, or about 3\u00bd per cent. of the population. Workers in gold and silver are a fairly important class, numbering 60,000, and workers in iron and steel number 100,000. These last are principally the village blacksmiths, who make and mend agricultural implements. About 66,000 persons are engaged in religious services, the majority of whom are supported by charity; and 137,000 are beggars.\n\nOrdinarily only two meals are eaten, the first about midday and the second in the evening at 7 or 8 p.m. But cultivators who have to work in the fields require some food in the early morning before going out. This usually consists of the remains of the previous evening meal eaten cold. The midday and evening meals are ordinarily of the same character, consisting of the staple food-grains, which are now mainly rice and jow\u0101r. Rice is boiled in water with salt and eaten with the various pulses, m\u016bng, urad, arhar, and tiw\u0101r\u012b, which are split and boiled in water. Vegetables and chillies are added when available, large quantities of the latter being consumed. Hot ghi or oil of sesamum is often added to vegetables and pulses after they have been cooked, while powdered turmeric is always mixed with pulses, and is supposed to neutralize the bad effects of the organic matter frequently contained in the water. Gulli or mahua oil and linseed oil are other substitutes\nfor ghi. Occasionally rice is boiled in butter-milk as a delicacy. Kodon and kutki are cooked and eaten in the same manner as rice by those who cannot afford that grain. Where rice is not the staple food, chapatis or thin unleavened cakes of ground wheat, gram, or jowar are usually substituted for it. Vegetables and pulses are eaten with the chapatis. On feast days cakes of wheat and gram are fried in ghi. Butter-milk is often drunk in the evenings. Pan, betel-leaf and betel-nut, is chewed after the midday meal by all classes in the Maratha country, and by those who are well-to-do elsewhere. Nearly every one smokes, biris or cigarettes rolled in leaves and chongis or leaf pipes being common in the south and east, and chillams or clay pipe-bowls without a mouth-piece elsewhere. Most castes will eat flesh, other than that of the unclean or sacred animals, but can rarely afford it.\n\nNearly all articles of dress are made of cotton cloth. The products of Indian and English mills have almost entirely ousted the old hand-woven cloth in towns, and are rapidly doing so in the country. Except the very poorest classes, every one has a pair of dhotis or loin-cloths which he changes daily, usually taking his bath in the one worn from the day before, and then changing it for the clean one. For the upper part of the body the garments used are a loose shirt, buttoning at the throat, or a short coat reaching to the waist, with a flap folding over in front where it is tied with strings. The long coat made with double flaps folding over the chest, and reaching down to the knees, which was formerly the universal full dress, is now going out of fashion. In the northern Districts in the cold season coats are stuffed with cotton for warmth. The poorer cultivators and labourers frequently leave the upper part of their body bare. Among the educated classes, especially Government servants of all grades, coats cut after the English fashion and made of serge, wool, or tasar silk are largely worn. The higher classes now wear also long white trousers instead of loin-cloths, in imitation of the English. The old head-dress was the pagri, formed from a piece of narrow cloth, sometimes 150 to 200 feet long, and twisted into innumerable folds. This is being rapidly ousted by the dupatta, or short cloth folded simply by the wearer himself, and formed of tasar silk, soft Madras cloth, or nainsook. In Chhattisgarh the cultivators usually go bareheaded; but in the rest of the Province a man will not be seen outside the house with his head bare, though with the poorer classes any wisp of cloth answers the purpose of a head-covering. Women generally wear a sari or a piece of cloth 18 to 24 feet long by 3 feet broad, secured round the waist and drawn over the shoulders and head. It is usually of hand-woven cloth, dyed red, blue, or green, and with various patterns stamped on it in other colours. English chintzes are also now worn. In the northern Districts the old fashion was to wear a lahenga, or skirt, a second cloth being used to cover the\nhead and upper part of the body; but the sari is now supplanting the skirt. Under the sari is worn a choli, a short sleeveless jacket buttoning tightly at the breast or back. In the house only a short cloth folding round the loins and pulled over the shoulders is worn. Men generally wear white clothes over the body, except in the case of coats, which are of some dark or neutral colour. Shoes are commonly worn, but in the rice Districts they cannot be worn in the fields. In Chhattisgarh sandals are used for road-work. Women, except of the labouring class, do not usually wear anything on their feet.\n\nThe houses of landowners stand in an enclosed courtyard, 90 to 120 feet long and 40 to 60 feet wide, surrounded by a brick wall. The front entrance gate is in the narrower side, and is often roofed in, with side rooms forming the dul\u0101n or hall for the reception of guests. Above it is a loft in which agricultural implements are kept. Along the sides of the yard are sheds for cattle or grain, and at the back is the dwelling-house, extending along the length of the enclosing wall, and about 15 feet wide. It has front and sometimes back verandas, is divided into rooms, and may be double-storeyed. Frequently a bamboo fence takes the place of the enclosing wall, and the house itself may be of matting plastered with earth. An ordinary cultivator has a similar house without the enclosure or sheds, and a poor cultivator only a two-roomed house with a front veranda. Cattle are frequently kept in one of the rooms. Large oval receptacles of matting covered with earth for holding grain are constructed inside the house. Chimneys are unknown, and smoke escapes through the tiles or thatch. In the more advanced Districts tiled roofs have now become the rule. The furniture consists only of a bed or wooden cot for each member of the family, their bedding, and the cooking and eating vessels. Substantial cultivators have these of brass or bell-metal, and poorer ones of earthenware. The better-class landowners have low wooden stools about six inches high for sitting on, but no chairs, tables, or carpets. The walls are whitewashed twice a year, at the Dew\u0101li and Holi festivals, and the floor is plastered with cow-dung and water once a week.\n\nThe majority of Hindus burn their dead, but certain castes bury them. Devotees, such as Gosains, Jangamas, Ling\u0101yats, and others, bury their dead in the sitting posture employed during lifetime for meditating on the deity. Children dying before marriage or investiture with the sacred thread, persons dying of small-pox, cholera, and leprosy, or by an accident, or killed by wild beasts, and pregnant women and women dying in childbirth are buried among certain castes. The forest tribes and some of the poorer castes of Hindus also usually bury their dead, because it is less expensive than cremation. Occasionally when bodies are buried, the bones are subsequently dug up and carried to a sacred river. The Muhammadans always bury their dead. Subject\nto the exceptions already mentioned, the general rule among Hindus is to burn the dead, the ashes being thrown into a river or tank.\n\nHindu children have much the same amusements as English ones, so far as their means permit. Dolls are made of clay and cloth, and occasionally their marriages are celebrated with feasts and fireworks. Swinging and walking on stilts are the pastimes of the month of Shr\u0101wan (July-August), the idea being that the crops will grow as high as the stilts or swing. Kite-flying is a favourite amusement with old and young in the open season. All classes gamble at the Dew\u0101li festival, playing at different games. Many different kinds of dances are practised. The Ah\u012brs have a stick dance at the Dew\u0101li, and the primitive tribes dance among themselves on festive occasions. Professional singing and dancing girls in towns are generally Muhammadans, and in villages belong to the castes of Bernt and Kol\u0101bhuti; these girls will sometimes dance at the Holi for eighteen hours consecutively, being sustained by large quantities of liquor. Representations of the history of R\u0101ma are given before the Dasahra festival, and occasionally the villagers have rude performances of their own, while professional dramatic and circus companies travel about. The villagers sometimes sing together in the evenings, and recitations of the sacred books are held at the houses of well-to-do persons. There are professional castes of acrobats and rope-dancers, snake-charmers, animal-trainers, jugglers, and clowns. Wrestling competitions are held on the N\u0101g Panchm\u012b or snake-festival, perhaps because the movements of the wrestler resemble the convolutions of a snake. Cock-fighting and ram-fighting are practised in certain Districts, and cattle-races are held in the N\u0101gpur country.\n\nThe ordinary festivals are observed. The Holi corresponds to the European Carnival, and is a festival of spring. The next great festival is the N\u0101g Panchm\u012b, when the cobra is worshipped, and after it the Raksh\u0101bandhan, when the sacred threads are changed. This is the great festival of the Br\u0101hmans. Next comes Pol\u0101 in the month of Bh\u0101don (August-September), which in some respects resembles a feast of atonement; the villages and all houses are cleaned and the sweepings thrown outside the boundary. Cattle-races are also held. The first fifteen days of Ku\u0101r (September-October) are called Pit\u1e5bpaksh, and during them every one pours libations in memory of his ancestors, while crows, representing the spirits of the deceased, are fed. At the Dasahra a buffalo is sometimes slaughtered in honour of Devi, and the people go out into the fields to see the n\u012blkanth, or blue jay, a very auspicious bird. Twenty days after the Dasahra comes the Dew\u0101li, the special festival of the Bani\u0101s, on which they worship a rupee and their account-books. The Hindu commercial year begins from this day. All classes light lamps in their houses so as not to be overlooked when\nLakshmi, the goddess of wealth, passes over them during the night and bestows her gifts. On the Til-Sankrant, in January, the sun commences its course from the southern towards the northern hemisphere, and at the instant that this happens it is a meritorious act to dive beneath the water of a sacred river. Fairs are consequently held at all convenient places for this purpose.\n\nHindus of the higher castes have two names, one for ceremonial and the other for ordinary use. The ceremonial name is the real one, but superstition prevents it being used in ordinary life, and a chaltu or current name is employed instead. These names fall into several categories. Many are those of gods and goddesses and sacred towns and rivers; a few are the names of jewels; others are taken from the day of the week on which the bearer was born, or from the date of the month, or the month itself or season; some denote the place of birth, and others are given to avert ill luck. Surnames exist only in the case of Maratha.\n\nRoughly speaking, four distinct kinds of agricultural land are found in the Province. The first is the heavy black soil which covers the Narbad\u0101 valley and the open and level portions of the Vindhyan and Satpur\u0101 plateaux. It is either alluvial, formed by the deposit of decayed vegetable matter, through the agency of rivers and streams, or has resulted from the decomposition of trap or basalt rock, or from a combination of both agents. This land is suited to the growth of wheat, linseed, gram, and other cold-season crops which are dependent on the moisture remaining in the ground from the monsoon rainfall, and on the showers received during the months of December and January. Water is usually found only at a great depth from the surface, and irrigation is consequently little resorted to. Embankments to save erosion and hold up water, and careful tillage, are the main requisites for cultivation. The second class of land consists of shallow black soil, lying in a thin sheet over the surface of the basaltic rock from which it has been decomposed. Land of this description predominates in Nimar, Wardha, the west of Nagpur, and the south of Chhindwara. It is suited for the growth of cotton, jowar, and other autumn crops requiring only the light rainfall which these tracts obtain. The soil responds readily to manure, and the application of industry largely increases the out-turn. The third class of land includes the light sandy and stony uplands of the Vindhyan and Satpur\u0101 ranges and the hilly country in the south, where the soil is either very shallow or contains a large proportion of gravel mixed with boulders. Lands of this description are the poorest in the Province; they require long resting fallows, and the cheap millets which they produce, constituting the main food-grain of the aboriginal cultivators who raise them, are entirely dependent on the\nrainfall of August and September. The last kind of land consists of yellow and sandy soil, formed from metamorphic or crystalline rock. This is the principal feature of the Wainganga and Mahanadi basins, including the south of Balaghat, Bhandara, and Chanda, and the three Chattisgarh Districts, which form the rice lands of the Province. The rainfall is heavy, and the land, though of little natural fertility, responds readily to manure and irrigation.\n\nAgricultural statistics are not compiled for the Feudatory States, which cover 29,435 square miles, or 25\u00bd per cent. of the Provincial area, nor for about 8,000 square miles of the most sparsely populated tracts in the samindaris where the quantity of cultivated land is so small that it is not worth while to undertake a cadastral survey. Excluding these, in 1903-4, 17,213 square miles, or 22 per cent. of the remaining area, were included in Government forests, 6,980 square miles, or 9 per cent., were classed as not available for cultivation, and 19,368 square miles, or 24\u00bd per cent., as cultivable waste other than fallow. The remaining area, amounting to 35,000 square miles, equivalent to 45 per cent. of the total land available, or 57 per cent. excluding Government forests, was occupied for cultivation. In the most advanced Districts cultivation is very close, reaching in some tracts to 80 per cent. of the whole area available after the exclusion of 'reserved' forests. And though 23,000 square miles are shown in the returns as cultivable waste, this consists mainly of hilly or rocky ground, which it would not be profitable to cultivate, and which should indeed, in the interests of the country, rather remain under jungle or grass than be cleared for the intermittent production of poor rains crops of millet. Considerable quantities of cultivable land must, however, still be available in the samindaris and Feudatory States. And there can be no question that the produce of the present area could be immensely increased by better and closer cultivation, quite apart from what is generally called high farming.\n\nOut of the total occupied area of 35,000 square miles, about 8,200 square miles are under old and new fallow. Resting fallows are rarely given to good rice and wheat land so long as the resources of the cultivator are sufficient to till them, but much land has lain fallow in recent years owing to the bad seasons and the inroads of kans grass (Saccharum spontaneum) in black soil fields. Frequent resting fallows are necessary for the poor soils of the Vindhyan and Satpura plateau. Here from 25 to 30 per cent. of the occupied area is normally left untilled, while in the rice country of Chattisgarh the proportion is only 20 per cent., and in the closely cultivated cotton-jowar country of Nagpur and Wardha it sinks to 13 per cent. The present area of fallow is from 1,600 to 2,300 square miles in excess of the normal.\n\nThe net cropped area amounts to over 27,003 square miles, having risen from 19,500 square miles since 1867-8. It expanded continuously\nup to 1893, but the unfavourable seasons since that date caused it to shrink in 1899-1900 to 2,100 square miles short of the normal. The figures for 1903-4 show that the area cropped in the m\u0101lguz\u0101ri tracts was still 300 square miles less than in 1892-3.\n\nSecond crops were grown on about 2,400 square miles in 1903-4, this being the maximum figure recorded up to the present in favourable years. The double-cropped area varies very largely, according as the autumn rain is sufficient or inadequate. The usual method of double cropping is to scatter the seed of the pulses, urad, m\u016bng, or tiur\u0101, and sometimes gram and linseed, in the wet rice-fields either when the rice is nearly ripe for harvest or just after it has been cut. In the northern Districts a catch-crop of rice is sown in the embanked wheat-fields during the rains.\n\nIncluding double crops, the gross cropped area is now nearly 29,500 square miles. Out of this, about 19,000 square miles are devoted to autumn crops or those sown during the rainy season and reaped at or after its close, and 10,400 to spring crops sown in the damp ground after the rains and reaped towards the end of the cold season. In recent years the popularity of the spring crops has greatly decreased, owing to the number of occasions when the monsoon has failed prematurely and the ground has become too dry to be sown, and over 3,200 square miles have been transferred to autumn crops since 1892-3. Of the total cropped area, about 18,000 square miles are occupied by the four main food-grains, rice, wheat, jow\u0101r, and kodon and kutki; 900 by other cereals; nearly 4,400 by pulses, the most important of which is gram; 3,350 by oilseeds, mainly linseed and til; over 3,300 by fibres, practically all of which is cotton; 2,200 by grass and fodder-crops; and 230 square miles by fruits, vegetables, and spices.\n\nRice (Oryza sativa) is the most important crop in the Province, covering about 7,000 square miles in 1903-4, or 24 per cent. of the cropped area. Excluding the samind\u0101ris, its acreage is now nearly 2 per cent. less than in 1892-3. A maximum area of 7,800 square miles was recorded in 1895-6. Rice is sown as soon as the rains have well broken, or towards the end of June, and the harvest lasts from September 15 to December 15 according to the different varieties and the different soils. The varieties of rice are extremely numerous, and are broadly divided into light rice sown on uplands, medium in level ground, and heavy rice in low-lying and irrigated fields. The light varieties are reaped first and the heavy ones last. As the crop requires water to be standing in the fields during a considerable period of its growth, rice is always cultivated in embanked fields. And as the fields must be quite level in order that their surface may be covered, wherever the country is at all undulating they are extremely small, as many as fifty sometimes going to an acre. Rice is grown year after year\nwithout rotation, and manure is necessary to keep up the productive capacity of the fields. The crop is not largely irrigated, except in the Waingang\u0101 valley and Sambalpur. Rice can scarcely be damaged by excessive rain unless it is washed out of the ground. In years of short rainfall, besides being liable to wither, it is attacked by grasshoppers. The average amount of seed sown to an acre is 100 lb., and the standard out-turn for the Province is 1,100 lb. or eleven-fold, giving 670 lb. of husked rice.\n\nWheat (*Triticum sativum*) covered nearly 4,600 square miles, or 15\u00bd per cent. of the cropped area, in 1903\u20134. The area has decreased from 6,700 square miles since 1893, wheat having been largely supplanted by *jow\u0101r*, and also, in the south, by cotton. Sowing commences towards the end of October, when the rains have stopped, and lasts through November and in embanked fields into December. The harvest is gathered from the beginning of March to the middle of April, being perhaps a fortnight earlier in the southern than the northern Districts. Wheat is very seldom manured, as the advantages obtained are not so great as in the case of the autumn crops, and in the black soil of the northern Districts it is grown year after year without manure or rotation. It is frequently sown mixed with a proportion of 5 to 25 per cent. of gram, which is advantageous to the soil, and very occasionally with linseed. It sometimes forms a rotation with *kodon* or with cotton and *jow\u0101r*, and frequently with linseed and gram. Between 50 and 60 lb. is sown to an acre in the southern Districts, and 90 to 100 lb. in the north. The standard out-turn is 600 lb.\n\nThe large millet *jow\u0101r* (*Sorghum vulgare*) now covers nearly 2,800 square miles, or 9\u00bd per cent. of the cropped area. The acreage under it has increased by 39 per cent. during the last decade, at the expense of wheat and linseed. It is mainly an autumn crop, but when the rainfall is heavy it is also grown after the rains. The ordinary seed-time is the first week in July, but in the north it is sometimes put down as soon as the rains break in June. The harvest extends over December and the first part of January. Only from 5 to 10 lb. of seed is sown to the acre, and the out-turn varies between 350 lb. in Mandl\u0101 and 700 lb. in Wardh\u0101. *Jow\u0101r* is frequently sown with a mixture of the pulse *arhar* (*Cajanus indicus*), in the proportion of one-seventh, or of *m\u016b\u1e45g* (*Phaseolus Mungo*). In the south it is grown regularly in rotation with cotton, the field being manured when cotton is sown.\n\n*Kodon* (*Paspalum scrobiculatum*) and *kukki* (*Panicum psilopodium*) are small grass-like millets grown on the poor highlands of the plateaux. Taken together, they cover 3,600 square miles, or 12 per cent. of the cropped area. The area under them has increased by 70 per cent. since 1892\u20133, about a third of the increase being due to the inclusion of zamindari statistics, and the remainder to substitution for rice and\nspring crops. *Kodon* is sown broadcast after rice in the beginning of July, and ripens towards the end of October and in November. The seed sown varies from 10 to 20 lb. an acre, and the out-turn is 420 lb., giving 210 lb. of husked grain. *Kutki* is a crop which ripens very rapidly, and can be cut within sixty days after it is sown. It is either sown at the break of the rains and reaped in August to get an early food-supply, or sown towards the end of August and reaped in October. From 5 to 10 lb. of seed is sown per acre, and the out-turn is said to be about 300 lb.\n\nThe other cereals cover about 900 square miles. Among these may be mentioned maize (*Zea Mays*), with 200 square miles, which is largely grown in the small garden plots at the back of houses, and the small millet *bajra* or *cambu*, with 85 square miles. Various other small millets also are grown.\n\nThe pulse gram (*Cicer arietinum*) covers about 1,450 square miles or 5 per cent. of the cropped area, and the acreage under it has increased by 40 per cent. since 1892\u20133, mainly at the expense of wheat. Gram is largely sown mixed with wheat in the proportion of 15 to 85, and also with linseed. The mixture is made to lessen the exhausting effect of these crops, as plants of the pea tribe exercise a recuperative effect on the soil by assimilating nitrogen through the roots. For the same reason it is grown in rotation with wheat and linseed. It is sown at the end of October and November with the wheat crop, and is cut either just before it or at the same time. Occasionally gram forms a second crop in black soil or irrigated rice-fields after the rice has been cut. From 60 to 80 lb. of seed is required for an acre, and the out-turn is 550 lb.\n\nThe other pulses cover nearly 3,000 square miles. Of these, the most important are *urad* (*Phaseolus radiatus*) and *mung* (*Phaseolus Mungo*), with a combined area of 1,250 square miles, mainly in Chhattisgarh. They are grown almost equally as autumn and spring crops, and in the latter case mainly as a second crop after rice, being sown broadcast in the standing grain after the water has been let out of the embanked fields. *Arhar* (*Cajanus indicus*) covers 500 square miles, principally in Nagpur and Nimar, where the cultivation has increased largely in the last year or two. It is grown in the autumn as a rotation crop in black soil land, and in Nagpur is largely mixed with cotton and *jowar*. *Tiura* or *lakh* (*Lathyrus sativus*) occupies 570 square miles, the area under it having decreased by 32 per cent. in the last decade. It is grown in the spring season, mainly in the rice Districts, as a second crop, and is given to cattle. *Masur* or lentil (*Ervum Lens*) is a spring crop grown under much the same conditions as gram, and also as a second crop after rice. It occupies about 350 square miles, mainly in Jubbulpore, Seoni, Narsinghpur, Betul, and Chhattisgarh. Peas (*Pisum arvense*) cover 320 square miles, mainly in Raipur and Bilaspur.\nOilseeds occupy about 3,350 square miles, or 11 per cent. of the cropped area. Of these, the most important is *til* (*Sesamum indicum*), the area under which has nearly doubled during the last decade and is now 1,500 square miles. It is grown both as an autumn and as a spring crop, the proportion of the former being about two-thirds, and it is distributed all over the Province. It is frequently sown mixed with *kodon*, *arhar*, and other crops. About 2 to 6 lb. of seed is sown to an acre, and the standard out-turn is 200 lb. Linseed covers about 1,300 square miles, this being a great deal less than the area under it in 1890. It is a cold-season crop, being sown in the beginning of October and cut in February, a month before wheat. Linseed is grown as a single crop in black soil and is somewhat exhausting, and also as a second crop after rice. About 10 to 20 lb. of seed is sown to the acre, and the out-turn is 260 lb. Of the remaining oilseeds, the most important is *ramtilli* or *jagni* (*Guizotia oleifera*). This is a rains crop and is grown on very poor soil, with little or no expenditure on cultivation. The out-turn is said to be about 150 lb. per acre. More than 50 square miles are under rape and mustard, which are generally grown in small garden plots.\n\nCotton now covers 2,000 square miles, or 7 per cent. of the cropped area. It has increased from 1,100 square miles since 1892\u20133 under the stimulus of high prices, and is still continuing to expand. The Wardh\u0101 valley, comprising Wardh\u0101 District and the west of N\u0101gpur, the Sausr *tahsil* of Chhindw\u0101ra, and Nim\u0101r District constitute the cotton tract of the Province, though the crop is also grown in Bet\u016bl, Narsinghpur, and Hoshang\u0101b\u0101d. Owing to the bulk of the fibre before it is cleaned and pressed, and the consequent cost of transport, cotton cultivation is not usually found profitable at a great distance from a railway. Cotton is generally sown immediately after the first heavy rain. In the Wardh\u0101 valley it is usually mixed with *arhar*, in the proportion of two or three lines of the latter after eight or ten of cotton. The picking goes on from the beginning of November to the beginning of February. From 8 to 16 lb. of seed is required per acre, and the standard out-turn is 240 lb. of uncleaned, yielding 70 lb. of cleaned cotton. Cotton is generally grown in rotation with *jow\u0101r* in the Wardh\u0101 valley, sometimes with wheat in the third year. It is an exhausting crop, and if sown twice successively the land must be turned up with the heavy plough and manured. The crop is greatly benefited by manure, and the cultivators make every effort to give it as much as possible. The only other fibre grown is *san*-hemp (*Crotalaria juncea*), which covers about 140 square miles.\n\nOf the 230 square miles under orchards, vegetables, and condiments, 30 are devoted to sugar-cane (*Saccharum officinarum*). This crop has greatly decreased in popularity since 1892\u20133, when it covered 70 square\nmiles, while for some years about 1870 the area was 140 square miles. With the extension of railway communication, however, the local gur or unrefined sugar has been undersold by that imported from Northern and Western India, which can be retailed at a substantially cheaper rate. Condiments and spices cover 60 square miles, those principally grown being betel-vine, turmeric, chillies, coriander, and ginger. More than 70 square miles are under vegetables, of which there is a very large variety. Melons and water-melons are grown on the sandy stretches exposed on the banks of rivers. About 70 square miles included in holdings and 25 excluded from them are shown as occupied by groves and orchards.\n\nThe following are the principal agricultural implements. The n\u0101gar or country plough has an iron share in spike form penetrating 6 or 9 inches, the body being made of wood. The bakkar or paring plough has a horizontal blade about 20 inches long and 4 inches wide, which is dragged across the ground and goes 2 or 3 inches deep. It is generally used in preparing land for sowing, unless the ground is very hard or is much overgrown with weeds. In the northern Districts the seed is sown with the n\u0101ri, consisting of a single bamboo tube fixed behind the spike of the plough, through which the seed is dropped. In the south the implement used for sowing is the tifan; this is formed of a log of wood to which three short iron spikes are fixed, and behind each of them is a hollow bamboo leading down from the sowing bowl at the top. The seed is thus sown simultaneously in three shallow furrows. The daur\u0101 is an implement used for weeding in the N\u0101gpur country. It resembles the bakkar, but the iron blade is much shorter so that it can pass between two lines of the crop. In the north weeding is done by hand with a spud. The dat\u0101ri is a sort of harrow used in the rice Districts for puddling the earth in the fields and collecting the weeds. For crushing the clods in the rice-fields, a heavy beam of wood is dragged across the field with a man standing on it.\n\nThe importance attached to manure varies with the character of the cropping. It is seldom used for the spring crops, and experience has shown that there is little profit in applying manure to unembanked wheat-fields unless wheat is grown in rotation with a rains crop. In rice and still more in cotton-juv\u0101r cultivation, on the other hand, the advantages of manure are fully appreciated. As a rule, the quantity available is insufficient, the cultivator's only source of supply being the droppings of his cattle. These are saved for manure in the rains, but during the open season are required for fuel-cakes; and even where an abundant supply of wood-fuel is available, it is often said that a mixture of cow-dung cakes is necessary for cooking purposes. The manure is usually stacked in surface heaps and is seldom pitted, much of its benefit being thus lost. Little or no use is made of the urine, though occasion-\nally a cultivator will put down straw or silt to retain it. Green-soiling also is very seldom practised, though crops of *jagri* and *til* are sometimes sown and ploughed in for this purpose. In the rice Districts the silt at the borders of tanks is dug up and placed on the fields and makes a very good manure, while in the cotton-*jowar* tracts flocks of sheep and goats are penned at night on the fields.\n\nThe model farm at N\u00e4gpur has existed for many years, and was made an experimental farm for the improvement of agriculture in 1883. Its operations were, however, conducted on a comparatively small scale till 1901, but important developments have taken place since. The staff has been largely strengthened, and two additional farms have been started at Raipur and Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d. Two cattle-breeding farms have recently been opened in N\u00e4gpur and Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d for the improvement of agricultural cattle. An agricultural school at N\u00e4gpur is maintained for the instruction of subordinate revenue officials and the sons of landowners, and agricultural associations have been formed in each District for the dissemination of information and the introduction of improved seed and implements. With the same view a number of small demonstration farms have been established, and a monthly Agricultural Gazette in Hindi is now published, which has attained a considerable circulation. In 1905 a separate Director of Agriculture was appointed, and the staff of the department largely expanded by the appointment of experts to initiate systematic research into the prevention of diseases, the destruction of pests, and the general development of the agriculture of the Province in accordance with the most advanced scientific methods. The budget of the Agricultural department for 1906-7 amounts to nearly 4 lakhs.\n\nBroadly speaking, it has been found that of the four main classes of soil and cultivation already described as existing in the Province, the rice lands are the only ones to which the application of irrigation can be expected to offer certain and immediate advantages. Up to the present time there have been no state irrigation works in the Central Provinces, and the area now irrigated is supplied almost entirely from private works, consisting of tanks, river channels, wells, and field embankments. In a normal year the maximum area irrigable is about 1,350 square miles, or only 5 per cent. of the total under crops. To this, however, should be added about 780 square miles of crops grown in lands saturated by means of field embankments. Including this land, 8 per cent. of the normal cropped area may be said to be protected by irrigation works. The area irrigated, however, varies largely from year to year with the character of the rainfall. Of 1,350 square miles actually irrigated, about 1,150, or 88 per cent. of the total, consist of rice irrigated from private tanks; and the remaining 200 of wheat, vegetables, condiments, spices, and sugar-cane irrigated chiefly from wells.\nTank-irrigation is confined almost entirely to rice. Of 1,150 square miles irrigated, about 780 are in the Wainganga valley and 360 in Chhattisgarh. Over the rest of the Province there is practically no irrigation of rice. British Districts contain about 47,500 tanks, of which 28,500 are to be found in the Wainganga rice Districts, including Seoni and Nagpur, and 18,500 in Chhattisgarh. Even in a favourable year the tanks of the Wainganga tract irrigate on an average less than 20 acres each, and those of Chhattisgarh only about 10 acres. The arrangements for disposing of flood waters are generally deficient, and the banks are often too weak to stand a high pressure. There are only about 65,000 irrigation wells, and the area supplied by them is 88,000 acres, or about 1\u00bd acres to each well. Out of the whole number, 15,000 are constructed of masonry and the remainder are small temporary wells, many of which are mere holes in the beds of streams. A permanent well irrigates 3 or 4 acres on an average. Rather more than half the area irrigated from wells consists of wheat and other spring crops, and the balance of sugar-cane and garden crops. The cost of a temporary well is Rs. 25 to Rs. 30, and of a permanent one Rs. 200 to Rs. 500, or more if blasting has to be done. About 50 square miles are irrigated from other sources, mainly by channels for the conveyance of water from rivers or streams; but considering the facilities which exist in many parts of the Province for the construction of small river-fed channels, the area irrigated in this way is remarkably small.\n\nThe Irrigation Commission (1901\u20133) were of opinion that there is ample scope for the extension of irrigation by means of storage tanks under exceptionally favourable conditions in the rice Districts. An Irrigation branch of the Public Works department has now been formed. About 200 projects for storage tanks have been drawn up. Their average capacity is about 300 million cubic feet; and it is estimated that they would protect a total area of 700 square miles of rice at a cost of about 3 crores of rupees, or at the rate of about Rs. 67 per acre. During 1903\u20134 the construction of tanks and field embankments as state irrigation works was begun departmentally.\n\nCattle are bred all over the Province, but animals of any quality are reared only in a few localities. The plough-cattle of nearly the whole rice area are miserably poor. They often cost only Rs. 25 or Rs. 30 a pair. The wheat country occupies an intermediate place between the rice tracts with the worst, and the cotton-jowar area with the best cattle. The price of bullocks here ranges from Rs. 50 to Rs. 80 a pair. The two good breeds used in the cotton-jowar Districts are bred in Nimar and along the southern face of the Satpura Hills. The Nimar cattle are generally dark red in colour, with small but well-proportioned bodies, and small sheaths and dewlaps; they are spirited and have strong feet and legs, and are well suited for hard work. A pair costs\nfrom Rs. 100 to Rs. 250. The cattle used in the Wardh\u0101 valley are called Gaolao, and are bred in Chhindw\u0101ra and in the Arv\u012b tahsil of Wardh\u0101. Animals of this breed are large and white, with full chests and fairly developed forearms, and are well suited for fast work. Their price varies from Rs. 100 to Rs. 300 a pair. Cultivating cattle of these breeds are fed on the stalks of jow\u0101r and on cotton-seed throughout the working season, and sometimes receive also pulse and oil-cake. In the wheat-growing Districts cultivating cattle are stall-fed only during the working season, when they get a ration of pulse, and in the rice Districts the majority of them usually receive nothing but straw. The Gaolao and Nim\u0101ri cattle are bred carefully from selected bulls; but in other areas bulls are seldom kept, and the immature bullocks are allowed to mix with the cows before castration, thus preventing any improvement in the breed.\n\nBuffaloes are bred all over the Province. They are useless for cultivation except in the rice area where water is frequently standing in the fields. In the northern Districts and the N\u0101gpur country the cows are kept for the manufacture of ghi (clarified butter) from their milk, while the young bulls are disposed of cheaply to the caste of Basdew\u0101s, who drive them in herds to Chhattisgarh for sale. A cow buffalo costs from Rs. 50 to Rs. 80, and in Chhattisgarh the young bulls fetch Rs. 15 to Rs. 20 each. The indigenous breed of ponies is almost entirely worthless, and the efforts made by Government to improve it by the provision of stallions have now been abandoned in favour of cattle-breeding farms. The highest price of a pony is about Rs. 100. Goats and sheep are usually bred by the professional shepherd castes, the former for food, for milk, which Muhammadans and low-caste Hindus drink, and for offerings to the deities, and the latter principally for their wool, from which the ordinary country blanket used by all cultivators is woven. The price of a goat is from Rs. 2 to Rs. 6, and of a sheep from Rs. 2 to Rs. 3.\n\nGrazing is generally adequate, except in a few of the most closely cultivated Districts. The forests of Mandli, the Baihar tahsil of B\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101r, Ch\u0101nda, and Nim\u0101r are well-known grazing grounds, to the first two of which thousands of cattle are sent from all the adjacent Districts during the hot season. Four important annual cattle-fairs are held in the Province\u2014at Singh\u0101ji in Nim\u0101r, Chhap\u0101ra in Seoni, Garh\u0101kot\u0101 in Saugor, and R\u0101jim in Raipur. Prizes for the best bred animals are offered at these fairs, but it is doubtful whether they have had much result. The principal cattle-diseases are rinderpest (m\u0101ta), anthrax (ghatsarap or ph\u0101si), foot-and-mouth disease (khuri and baikr\u0101), and pleuro-pneumonia (phapsia). A variety of native remedies are used, several of which are of little value; but strict segregation is very seldom attempted, and cultivators generally say that it is impracticable. A\nCivil Veterinary department has been established, supervised by a qualified officer under the Director of Agriculture. Eighteen veterinary dispensaries have been opened at the head-quarters of Districts with subordinate Veterinary Assistants, who also travel in the interior of Districts for the treatment of epidemic disease.\n\nThe development of the system of advances under the Land Improvement and Agriculturists' Loans Acts is a feature of recent years. Taking the former kind of loans first, the total amount advanced under the Act of 1871 up to 1883 was only Rs. 50,000, and under the new Act of 1883 up to 1895, 2-7 lakhs. During the famine of 1897 the policy of providing work by giving land improvement loans received a great impetus, a quarter of the principal being usually remitted if the conditions of the grant were carried out. In the second famine of 1900, however, it was considered with justice that the landowners were too impoverished to be asked to expend capital on the provision of work, and a new system was introduced by which free grants were made by Government for the construction of tanks and other improvements. The ordinary purposes for which loans have been made since 1883 are the construction and repair of village tanks, the embankment of wheat-fields, and the destruction of kans grass in the Vindhyan Districts. Between 1895 and 1904, about 18 lakhs was lent. Advances under the Agriculturists' Loans Act of 1884 are made for the purchase of plough-cattle and seed. These advances also began on a very small scale, 3-2 lakhs being lent between 1884 and 1891, or less than half a lakh annually. With the advent of scarcity in the northern Districts in 1893 the amounts advanced rose rapidly, and between 1891 and 1895 15 lakhs was distributed in loans. During 1896\u20137 the advances were 15 lakhs, and in the famine of 1900 38 lakhs, the greater part of the latter sum being granted without interest. A total of 101 lakhs had been advanced by 1904 in agriculturists' loans.\n\nThe rates of interest on private loans are fairly uniform all over the Province, though they have a tendency to be lower in the most advanced Districts, where the cultivators are capable of protecting their own interests. For large sums borrowed on ample security or on pledge of jewellery, the rate varies from 6 to 9 per cent. For ordinary proprietors and the best class of tenants or on mortgage of unencumbered land, the average is 12 per cent. Tenants in moderate circumstances, who may be indebted but not hopelessly involved, pay from 18 to 24 per cent.; while for the poorest classes of tenants and for small unsecured loans to artisans and others, the interest rises to 37\u00bd, 50, and even 100 per cent. In the case of grain advanced either for seed, or for subsistence while the crop is maturing, the ordinary rate for wheat and the other cold-season grains is 25 per cent. between sowing and harvest, though it sometimes rises to 50 per cent. in time\nof famine. In the Districts where spring crops are mainly grown, the interest on the autumn seed-grains is usually 100 per cent. But in the rice Districts the rate for rice is 25, 37\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), or rarely 50 per cent., while for jowar the rate in Wardh\u0101 is only 25 per cent. and in other jowar-growing Districts 50 per cent. The rates for oilseeds are high, ranging from 50 to 100 per cent. Nearly all the large money-lenders and the majority of the smaller ones are M\u0101rw\u0101r\u012b Bani\u0101s; but many other castes, as Br\u0101hmans, R\u0101jputs, and the castes who own and cultivate land, also participate in the business. Most cultivating proprietors who are in good circumstances prefer to lend grain for seed and subsistence to their tenants, because in addition to its being very profitable they find it much more easy to realize the rents in this case than when their tenants are indebted to another creditor.\n\nThe grant of proprietary rights, followed by a large increase in the value of landed property, converted the village landowners, the descendants of the rack-rented headmen of Mar\u0101th\u0101 times, into a substantial body of men. But the great increase of credit which they suddenly obtained led many of them to indulge in reckless extravagance on marriages and other occasions of display. Inquiries made in 1888 showed that during the previous twenty-five years one-fifth of the village lands had changed hands, half of the transfers being to the money-lending as opposed to the cultivating classes. During the next fifteen years the process cannot fail to have been more rapid, though the famine of 1900 was, owing to the great assistance given by the state, undoubtedly less injurious to the financial condition of the cultivators than that of 1896\u20137. Government has been alive to the burden of excessive debt thrown on the cultivators, and, to lighten it and to encourage them to make a fresh start, has instituted proceedings in the worst tracts for the voluntary liquidation of debts of both landlords and tenants. These have been in many cases eminently successful, and creditors have agreed to a scheme of repayment of part of the debt in instalments spread over a number of years, the balance being freely forgone. In eight Districts, in part or the whole of which these proceedings have been taken, debts aggregating 1-64 crores have been dealt with and 96 lakhs remitted by creditors.\n\nEconomic rent is practically non-existent in the Central Provinces, the rents of all classes of tenants except sub-tenants being fixed by the Settlement officer at the periodical revision of the land revenue. The rental of the previous settlement being taken as a standard, enhancements are based on the increase in the prices of produce, or extension of cultivation, according to a general rate previously determined, which is usually considerably less than that actually warranted by the statistics. During the currency of the settlement, a period of twenty or thirty years, the\nlandlord can practically raise rents only through the agency of a revenue court, which determines an equitable rate. A sub-tenant is a person holding land from another tenant or in the proprietor's home farm, and is not protected by law. The following maximum and minimum figures of rental represent the average for groups of villages of greatest and least fertility in each area, while the average rental is the average of all the groups. The fertile wheat-growing tract of the Narbad\u0101 valley has the highest rental, the figures per acre being maximum Rs. 3\u201312, minimum 3 annas, average Rs. 1\u201310\u20136. Next to this come the rice tracts of Bhand\u0101ra and B\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t with a large percentage of irrigation, maximum Rs. 1\u201312, minimum 4 annas, average Rs. 1\u20131, while the cotton-jow\u0101r Districts of N\u0101gpur and Wardh\u0101 have nearly the same rates with a maximum of Rs. 1\u201315, minimum 7 annas, average 15\u00bd annas. The figures for the Vindhyan plateau Districts are maximum Rs. 1\u201312, minimum 6 annas, average 15 annas, and for the poorer area of the S\u0101tpur\u0101 plateau maximum Rs. 1\u201312, minimum 3 annas, average 8 annas. The rice country of Chhattisgarh pays at present a very low rental in proportion to its fertility, the figures being maximum 15 annas, minimum 11 pies, average 10 annas. Owing to the fact that all Districts contain areas of very poor land, the figures of minimum rental do not afford much information. The general rental incidence of the Province is 12 annas, and the average area of a tenant's holding is 12 acres. The rents paid by sub-tenants are usually twice or three times the average rental. In the cotton-growing area during the last few years land has been sublet for ten times the Government rental or more. The custom of paying rents in kind is no longer important, as the policy of Government has been to commute all such rents into cash. But lands are often sublet on a contract for dividing the produce. In such cases the contract is usually that the owner or tenant of the land supplies the bullocks and seed-grain, while the sub-lessee does all the labour. When the crop has been harvested the seed-grain and sometimes the rent is deducted, and the remainder divided equally between the parties. In the zam\u012bnd\u0101ris where shifting cultivation still goes on in the forests, rents are paid in grain on an 'axe' of land, that is, a patch cleared by one family, and amounting to something over an acre.\n\nWages for agricultural labour are still generally paid in kind, and farm-servants employed by the year receive various perquisites at sowing-time and harvest, so that the determination of their cash equivalents presents much difficulty. Generally it may be said that grain wages have remained constant for a long period, though in recent years and owing to the famines there has been a tendency either to decrease their amount or to substitute inferior varieties of grain. In N\u0101gpur and Wardh\u0101 Districts, owing to the competition of the factories\nand mines, wages have risen largely, the cash rates for farm-servants being Rs. 50 to Rs. 80 a year, compared with Rs. 40 in 1890, and Rs. 20 to Rs. 25 in 1860. The corresponding figures for the Narbada valley are Rs. 60, Rs. 42, and Rs. 25. In other Districts the increase of wages has not more than kept pace with the rise in prices. In Chhattisgarh farm-servants usually receive a fourth of the produce to be divided between them. In the Satpur\u0101 Districts they get a fifth of the produce. During the year advances of grain are made to them, and these are deducted with interest when they are paid. In other Districts they receive a monthly wage of grain, while in the more advanced tracts cash payments are being substituted for this. The grain wages amount in some of the northern Districts to about 950 lb. a year, and in the Waingang\u0101 valley to between 1,400 and 2,000 lb. of unhusked rice. At the wheat harvest labourers earn two or three days' food for a day's work, the rate being one sheaf in twenty or thirty cut. For jowar-cutting in Wardha, 7\u00bd lb. of grain a day is paid. About 10 lb. of unhusked rice and 5 lb. of wheat per day are other typical rates for harvesting. For sowing the crops men are generally employed, and women for weeding and transplanting. Cash wages for men are 3 to 4 annas a day in the south, 2 to 2\u00bd annas in the north, and 1\u00bd to 2 annas in Chhattisgarh during the busy season. Women get half an anna less than men in Chhattisgarh, and an anna less elsewhere. Certain village artisans and servants receive payment in kind for services rendered to the cultivators. Those usually found are the Loh\u0101r or blacksmith, the Barhai or carpenter, the Nai or barber, the Dhobi or washerman, the Dhimar or water-bearer, the Cham\u0101r or tanner, and the village priest.\n\nAt the time of the formation of the Province in 1861 prices were very low, as was natural in a landlocked tract with little or no means of exporting its surplus. Various causes, the chief of which were a great influx of European capital and the abnormal demand for cotton occasioned by the American Civil War, brought about an extraordinary rise in 1863, continuing until 1869, when a general fall set in, which was, however, checked by the opening of railway communication with the seaport towns, and the demand for grain arising from the famine of 1876-8 in Northern India and Madras. Between 1881 and 1891, as shown in Table V (p. 104), prices rose steadily, and in 1891 the increase per cent. on 1862 was given as rice 200, wheat 169, jowar 123, and gram 105. During the last decade prices again rose, and reached their highest point in the famine of 1897. They fell in the two following years, and did not rise to quite such a high level again in the famine of 1900. A considerable fall followed, and the averages for 1904 were nearly the same as in 1891. The prices of salt, sugar, yarn, and cotton piece-goods have also decreased. Owing to the improvement of communications, there is now less variation in prices between town and\ncountry, and a more uniform level is maintained throughout the Province. In normal years the prices of the staple crops are almost entirely governed by those obtainable for exports, which depend on the European market. The movement of prices has on the whole been very favourable to the people, for while the articles which they produce, such as the agricultural staples, have largely increased in value, the prices of articles which they consume but do not produce have generally diminished.\n\nThe most prosperous part of the Province is the cotton-growing tract of the Wardh\u0101 valley. Here, owing to the development of mining and factory industries, a daily labourer is as well-to-do as an ordinary tenant elsewhere, and his condition is in many respects preferable to that of a half-educated clerk. In the Vindhyan plateau and Narbad\u0101 valley Districts the standard of living is comparatively high, though the people have recently become impoverished from bad seasons. There is usually a full establishment of village servants whose services are utilized by all cultivators for work which elsewhere they do themselves, while a larger proportion of indoor servants are employed than elsewhere. Shoes and head-cloths are here universally worn, even labourers usually have blankets, and cultivators have quilted cotton coats and caps for the cold season. In Chhatt\u012bsgarh and on parts of the S\u0101tpur\u0101 plateau the standard of living is still very low. A couple of strips of cloth and perhaps a blanket suffice for the dress of the cultivator, while his food consists of little but a gruel of boiled rice and water. But even here, the last few years would have witnessed a great development had it not been arrested by famine. The annual cost of food for an adult cultivator may be taken as varying from Rs. 15 in the poorest to Rs. 35 in the richest tracts. The cost of clothes for a labourer and his wife of the poorest class in Chhatt\u012bsgarh will scarcely be more than Rs. 3, and will consist of two or three cloths without blankets or shoes. The ordinary cultivator will spend from Rs. 5 to Rs. 10 annually in clothing his family. The value of his house will be from Rs. 10 to Rs. 40, and of his furniture Rs. 5 or Rs. 6, while a labourer's house is worth only Rs. 3 or Rs. 4, and his furniture about half this. The condition of the proprietary class varies greatly, some being no better off than ordinary cultivators, while most of them live like a clerk on Rs. 30 to Rs. 40 a month. Their houses and clothes may be inferior to his, but they have richer and better food. A clerk with this income spends about Rs. 20 a year on his own clothes and the same for those of his wife and family, his wife's ornaments having been provided at the wedding. The food of the family will cost Rs. 200 a year or more. He occupies a brick house with several rooms, paying a rent of about Rs. 3 a month, and as much more for the services of a barber, washerman, water-bearer, and sweeper. His furniture may be worth Rs. 75. A visible rise in comfort of living\nhas occurred in towns. Imported cloth of fine texture is worn, matches are in general use, foreign cigarettes are smoked, kerosene oil is universally used, and lamps with glass chimneys are found in ordinary households. Tea is drunk daily, refined instead of unrefined sugar is eaten, and soda-water is frequently drunk. Many clerks of ordinary means subscribe to vernacular newspapers, and social clubs exist in several towns. Life insurance is increasing in popularity.\n\nThe area of Government forests in the Central Provinces is shown as 18,734 square miles in the forest returns. The majority of the forests are situated on the northern and southern slopes of the S\u0101tpur\u0101 range, and the remainder on the Vindhyan Hills in the north and on the ranges bounding the N\u0101gpur and Chhatt\u012bsgarh plains to the south. The greater part of these latter hills are occupied by forests included in the samtnd\u0101ris and Feudatory States. In addition to the Government forests, 9,874 square miles of forest are in the hands of samtnd\u0101rs and village proprietors, while it is estimated that there are about 15,000 square miles in the Feudatory States, this latter figure, however, including scrub and grass. The whole area under forests in the Province is therefore about 44,000 square miles, or 38 per cent. of the total area.\n\nFour main types of forest may be distinguished: the teak, s\u0101l, mixed, and bamboo forests. Teak (Tectona grandis) occurs either alone or mixed with other species. It is not largely found north of the Narbad\u0101, but extends over the western S\u0101tpur\u0101 Districts and the hills south of the N\u0101gpur plain. The best forests are in the Bor\u012b Reserve in Hoshang\u0101b\u0101d and at All\u0101pillai in Ch\u0101nda. In Bor\u012b specimens 80 to 100 feet high and 6 feet in girth are obtained. Pure teak forest appears on the lower slopes of the hills, or on alluvial flats along the banks of rivers or at the bottom of ravines. More commonly, and on the higher and middle slopes, teak is mixed with the other species occurring in mixed forests. The teak forests have been very greatly damaged by clearings for cultivation and the indiscriminate fellings of timber contractors before a system of conservation was introduced. The next timber tree in importance is s\u0101l (Shorea robusta). The s\u0101l forests cover a large tract or belt in the east of the Province, commencing in the plateau beneath the Kaimur range in Rewah and extending over Mandl\u0101, the northern frontier of Chhatt\u012bsgarh, the hills bounding the valleys of the Mah\u0101nadi and its affluents to the Eastern Gh\u0101ts and south to the valley of the Indr\u0101vati. The larger proportion of the s\u0101l forests are thus situated in the samtnd\u0101ris and Feudatory States of Chhatt\u012bsgarh. The average height of good trees is 60 to 80 feet, with a clear stem to the first branch of 30 to 40 feet, and a girth of 6 to 8 feet. Specimens of 100 feet in height and 10 feet in girth are found in Mandl\u0101. Mixed forest with or without a proportion of teak is the most common\ntype all over the Province. The most important tree is *s\u0101j* (*Terminalia tomentosa*), and other common and valuable timber trees are *bij\u0101s\u0101l* or *beula* (*Pterocarpus Marsupium*), *tend\u016b* or *ebony* (*Diospyros tomentosa*), *lendi\u0101* (*Lagerstroemia parviflora*), *anjan* or *koh\u0101* (*Terminalia Arjuna*), *dhaur\u0101* (*Anogeissus latifolia*), *hald\u016b* (*Adina cordifolia*), *aonl\u0101* (*Phyllanthus emblica*), *tins\u0101* (*Ougeinia dalbergioides*), and *giry\u0101* or satin-wood (*Chloroxylon Swietenia*). Among trees which are valuable for other products than timber, the *mahu\u0101* (*Bassia latifolia*) is pre-eminent and very common, while *harr\u0101* (*Terminalia Chebula*), whose fruit gives the myrabolams used for tanning, *ach\u0101r* (*Buchanania latifolia*), whose fruit called *chironji* is largely used for sweetmeats, and *khair* (*Acacia Catechu*), from the wood of which cutch is prepared, are also important trees. The dry stony hill-tops and plateaux and scarped slopes are mainly covered by *salai* (*Boswellia serrata*), a tree of very little value, mixed with stunted specimens of other species. In many places, especially on stretches of flat or undulating land, the forest is very open and poorly stocked, even developing into grass land where areas have formerly been cleared for shifting cultivation. Bamboo forests cover the hillsides over large areas, sometimes pure, but generally mixed with other species, or forming an undergrowth to the teak.\n\nFor administrative purposes the Government forests are divided into two Conservators' charges. Generally, the forests in each District form a Forest division under the charge of a Deputy or Assistant Conservator of the Imperial Forest service or an Extra-Assistant Conservator of the Provincial service. Each division is divided into ranges in charge of an upper subordinate designated a forest ranger. In 1903\u20134 the Forest Staff comprised 2 Conservators, 9 Deputy-Conservators, 4 Assistant Conservators, 13 Extra-Assistant Conservators, 63 rangers, 58 deputy-rangers, 175 foresters, and 1,657 forest guards.\n\nUp to 1893 the felling of trees was allowed under licence without regulation; but since that date working-plans have been drawn up for the majority of the forests, under which systematic fellings have been introduced. The bulk of the produce required for agriculture and building purposes is disposed of by licence, the purchaser being required to take out a stamped licence supplied by vendors stationed in various villages adjoining the forest. In tracts near the forests, whole villages are allowed to commute for their annual supply of fuel and timber for home consumption on payment of a fixed sum. The collection of various minor products, such as myrabolams, lac, honey, gum, special grasses, *mahua*, and the hides and the horns of animals dying in the forests, are leased out to contractors. In cases where a large fixed demand can be arranged for, the department itself undertakes contracts for timber. Free grants are sometimes made for works of public utility, such as schools and dispensaries, or for the relief of the occupiers\nof a village which has been burnt down. For grazing, licences are issued of two kinds, one covering the open forests of the District, and the other or nomadic licence those of the whole Province. Certain valuable timber areas are closed to grazing, and in addition all 'coupes' are closed for ten years after being worked over.\n\nThe supply of produce of all kinds is generally in excess of the local demand, which is largely met from the forests in the hands of private holders, these being worked with much less restriction than the Government forests. The amount of produce removed from the forests in 1903-4 was 3\u00bd million cubic feet of timber, 18 million cubic feet of fuel, 19\u00bd million bamboo stems, and 53,000 tons of grass. The following figures show the average annual revenue, expenditure, and surplus for the decades ending 1890 and 1900, and the years 1901-2 and 1903-4:\n\n(1881-90) revenue 10.81 lakhs, expenditure 5.18 lakhs, surplus 5.63 lakhs; (1891-1900) revenue 10.31 lakhs, expenditure 8.92 lakhs, surplus 1.39 lakhs; (1901-2) revenue 11.88 lakhs, expenditure 10.13 lakhs, surplus 1.75 lakhs; (1903-4) revenue 14.04 lakhs, expenditure 10.59 lakhs, surplus 3.45 lakhs. The small surplus realized during the second decade was due to the forests being thrown open in several years for free removal of produce during famine. The necessary restrictions placed on grazing have had the effect of considerably diminishing the income under this head. At the same time there has been a large increase in the area under systematic fire-protection, and the restriction of fellings to specified areas introduced in 1893 caused at least a temporary decline in income.\n\nThe relations with the people are generally good, and the number of forest offences is not excessive considering the extent of the forests. The handling of the primitive tribes, who resent interference with their free use of the forest, requires considerable tact and firmness. The labour supply for forest work, except at sowing and harvest time, is generally sufficient; where it is difficult to procure outside labour, forest villages have been established within the boundaries of 'reserved' forest, in order to have at hand a permanent supply of workpeople who are by race, caste, or occupation habituated to the extraction or handling of forest produce. In times of scarcity and famine the forests are thrown open for the free collection of all edible products, and, if necessary, for the removal of fuel, grass, and sometimes bamboos by head-loads in order to employ labour. This concession is valuable, as a large variety of edible products in the shape of flowers, fruits, seeds, gum, leaves, and roots can be obtained by natives accustomed to a jungle life. If grass is scarce, free grazing also is allowed. Besides this, the construction of forest roads and sometimes the cutting of fire-lines is undertaken, and this work affords congenial employment to the primitive tribes, many of whom will not attend ordinary relief works. In the famines of 1897 and\nproduce to the value of between 3 and 4 lakhs was removed free of charge. In the famine of 1900, when a serious scarcity of fodder was apprehended, the cutting of grass was undertaken as a relief work, and 83,000 tons were cut at a cost of 5 lakhs. The greater part of the 'reserved' forests are now protected from fire, fire-lines being cut all round the protected forest, while for the more valuable areas a special establishment of fire-watchers is employed during the hot season. In 1903-4, 8,153 square miles of forest were protected at a cost varying from Rs. 2 to Rs. 11 per square mile.\n\nCoal-measures occur in various parts of the Province, all belonging to the Bar\u0101kar group of Gondw\u0101na rocks. They may be classified broadly as situated in the S\u0101tpur\u0101 basin, the Wardh\u0101-God\u0101vari valley, and the Mah\u0101nadi valley. The principal fields in the S\u0101tpur\u0101 basin are those of Mohp\u0101ni, Sh\u0101hpur or Bet\u016bl, and the Pench valley in Chhindw\u0101ra. The Mohp\u0101ni field, near G\u0101darw\u0101ra in Narsinghpur, is worked by a company. So far as the Sh\u0101hpur field has been explored, the outcrops which lie on the south of the Taw\u0101 valley do not appear to be of great promise, the coal being inferior and of irregular thickness. In Chhindw\u0101ra numerous seams have been discovered in several localities varying in thickness from 3 to 14 feet. A recent analysis of the quality of the coal shows that it can be worked profitably, and mining operations have been started with the opening of the railway to Chhindw\u0101ra.\n\nThe Wardh\u0101 valley field extends for about 285 miles in the valleys of the Wardh\u0101, Pr\u0101nhita, and God\u0101vari rivers. The coal has been worked only in a Government colliery at Waror\u0101, but prospecting licences have been taken out for large areas. At Bandar, 30 miles north-east of Waror\u0101, three seams with a maximum thickness of 38 feet have been proved to exist. It is estimated that the Wardh\u0101 valley field contains 14 million tons of coal. The Mah\u0101nadi basin comprises the Raigarh-Hemgir, Korb\u0101, and M\u0101nd coal-fields, which cover an area of not less than 1,000 square miles; the coal-seams are sometimes of enormous size, and thicknesses as great as 90 feet at Korb\u0101 and even 168 feet at Hemgir have been recorded; but, though including good coal, these are often largely made up of carbonaceous shale. Sometimes, too, the seams die out within surprisingly short distances. A good seam of steam coal and two seams of rather inferior quality have been discovered near R\u0101mpur, where the field is crossed by the Bengal-N\u0101gpur Railway. The Mohp\u0101ni mines were worked by the Nerbudda Coal and Iron Company from 1862 to 1904, when the Great Indian Peninsula Railway Company purchased them. The output in 1904 was 25,617 tons valued at 1.34 lakhs, and 664 operatives were employed. The Waror\u0101 colliery has been worked by Government since 1871, the capital outlay being 15 lakhs. The output in 1904 was 112,319 tons, valued at 5.21 lakhs,\nand 1,040 operatives were employed, chiefly men from the United Provinces. There is a large local demand for the coal from the Great Indian Peninsula Railway and the factories of Nagpur and Wardha. The present seams at Warora are, however, nearly worked out\\(^1\\), and fresh seams at Ballalpur are being tested. The wages of miners in the collieries vary from 5 annas to 10 annas a day, while unskilled coolies receive 3 annas.\n\nIron ores of good quality occur in Jubbulpore, Mandla, Narsinghpur, Chanda, Bhandara, Balaghat, Raipur, and Bilaspur, and smaller veins in Saugor and Seoni. The most extensive deposits appear to be in Chanda, where the Lohara hill, 3 furlongs long, 200 yards broad, and 120 feet high, is described as consisting of compact crystalline hematite with some magnetic oxide, and the ore is believed to be traceable for a considerable distance. The percentage of iron found in the ores in the more important localities varies from 68 to 73. A prospecting licence has recently been given in Chanda with a view to the establishment of iron-works on modern methods, and licences have also been issued in Raipur and Sambalpur. The ores are worked in several Districts by indigenous methods by the caste of Agarias or iron-workers, who are an offshoot of the Gonds. The best-known centres are Sihora in Jubbulpore and Tendukhedha in Narsinghpur. The returns for 1904 show 441 furnaces working, with an output of 2,818 tons of iron. Iron ochre is worked at Katni in Jubbulpore for the manufacture of paint.\n\nManganese ores are found in the Districts of Jubbulpore, Chhindwara, Nagpur, Bhandara, and Balaghat. A number of prospecting licences and mining leases have been granted in the last four Districts, and during recent years an important mining industry has sprung up. The workings are all from the surface, but fifteen of the quarries have now reached a greater depth than 20 feet and have been brought under the Mines Act. The output of manganese from these was 85,000 tons in 1904, the most important mines being in the Ramtek tahsil of Nagpur District. The number of persons employed in the manganese mines in 1904 was 2,010.\n\nLimestone is abundant in Jubbulpore, Chanda, and the Chhattisgarh Districts, but is exploited only at Murwara in Jubbulpore, where 16 quarries are situated, all except one being worked by manual labour. These quarries are under the Mines Act. Their output in 1904 was 49,847 tons of lime, valued at about 5 lakhs, and 2,510 persons were employed. Fuller's earth is obtained in another quarry. Excellent stone is obtained from a number of sandstone quarries at Murwara, and exported in the shape of posts and slabs. Sandstone is quarried for building purposes in many Districts, but statistics of output are not recorded.\n\n\\(^1\\) The Warora colliery was closed in 1906.\nThese minerals are the only ones as yet proved capable of yielding a profit on working, but many others exist. The Mahanadi and several of its tributaries, the Son in Balaghat, and other rivers contain auriferous sands, and a few persons earn a precarious livelihood by washing for gold. Argentiferous galena occurs in several localities, samples from Sleemanabad in Jubbulpore and Jog in Hoshangabad yielding 19 oz. 12 dwt. and 21 oz. 3 dwt. per ton of lead respectively. Prospecting licences have been taken out at both places. Copper ores are known to exist at Chicholi in Raipur, at Sleemanabad in Jubbulpore, at Barmhan in Narsinghpur, and in Chanda and Balaghat. Mica occurs in Balaghat, Bilaspur, and Bastar, but the plates are too small to be of commercial value. Bauxite, an aluminous ore, is found in Balaghat. Graphite or plumbago has been discovered in Raipur and Kalahandi. Agate pebbles are found in Jubbulpore, and are worked up into various articles of ornament by the local lapidaries.\n\nWith the exception of one or two small industries, the articles manufactured by hand in the Central Provinces are of the simple nature designed to meet the wants of a primitive agricultural population and possess little artistic merit. The principal manufactures are silk-weaving, cotton-weaving, cotton dyeing and printing, gold- and silver-work, brass, copper and bell-metal work, and the making of glass bangles. Pottery, bamboo-work, and blanket-weaving are of somewhat less importance. These industries are as a rule not in a prosperous condition, owing to the competition of more highly organized methods of manufacture and to changes in fashion.\n\nThe silk industry supports 23,000 persons. Imported or mulberry silk is principally woven in Nimar, Nagpur, and Bhandara, while the indigenous tasar silk is worked in Chanda and Chattisgarh. In the former Districts cotton cloths woven with silk borders are the staple product. In Burhanpur these are ornamented with gold and silver lace, and the embroidered cloths produced here were once estimated second only to the precious fabrics of Dacca and Surat, and formed the basis of a lucrative trade with Europe. There is now little demand for the more expensive cloths. The silk-bordered loin-cloths and sari or women's cloths of Nagpur and Bhandara are still in large request, and the weavers are fairly prosperous. The tasar silk industry shows signs of revival with the facilities recently granted for the cultivation of cocoons in Government forests. Industries connected with cotton now support about 400,000 persons, a decline of 37 per cent. since 1891. Cotton-spinning, formerly carried on in every village, is practically extinct as an industry. The low-caste Katiyas, Mahars, and Gandas, who weave the coarser kinds of country cloth from thread purchased at the mills, still find a market among the poorer tenants and labourers.\nBut, except for the silk-bordered cloths already noticed, the higher classes of natives are taking more and more to the use of English and Indian mill-woven fabrics, which, though less durable, are smoother and cheaper. The number of cotton-weavers is largest in the Districts of the Nagpur plain, where the crop is principally grown. The trade of the dyer is declining with that of the weaver. The finer cloth is woven with coloured thread. The indigenous madder, safflower, turmeric, and indigo have been supplanted by chemical substitutes imported from Europe. Practically the only woollen article made is the coarse country blanket woven by the shepherd castes, who combine this occupation with the tending of sheep. The leather-working industry is, next to that of cotton, the most important numerically, employing 96,000 persons. Workers in leather decreased by 27 per cent. during the decade ending 1901. Various patterns of shoes are worn, the better qualities having ornamental designs worked with silk and cotton thread and lace. Ornamental slippers are made in Chanda and also table-covers, consisting of red leather embroidered with gold wire and green silk. Leathern reins and saddles in imitation of Cawnpore work are made in some towns. There is little worthy of remark in the ornamental gold- and silver-work of the Central Provinces, which is as a rule heavier and coarser than that made elsewhere in India, while the designs do not appeal to European taste. The variety of ornaments is considerable, but cannot be described here. Brass is generally imported in sheets from Bombay, and brass vessels are obtained ready-made in large quantities. Copper vessels are for the most part imported, but are also manufactured in Chanda. Bell-metal is an alloy made of copper mixed with zinc, tin, or pewter. Vessels for holding food are made from it, and bell-metal with a large proportion of zinc is used for the manufacture of ornaments, which are largely worn in the northern Districts. Brass ornaments are mainly worn by the aboriginal tribes.\n\nCarpentering is not usually a village industry in the Central Provinces, the work required by cultivators being often done by the blacksmith. The largest numbers of workers at this trade are found in the Districts where there are large towns, and rural Districts only return a few hundred. Chhattisgarh is especially deficient in this respect. Wood-carving of considerable artistic merit is executed in Nagpur and Saugor. Bamboo-workers make household matting, screens for walls, baskets of all sizes and for all purposes, brushes, fans, sieves, and combs. Carpenters and bamboo-workers together numbered 116,000 in 1901.\n\nVessels of earthenware are used for cooking by all classes, and by the poorer ones for eating and drinking from. Other articles made of earthenware are pipe-bowls, clay dolls and images, and models of animals.\n\nThe number of cotton spinning and weaving mills in the Province in\n1904 was seven, two being situated at Nagpur, two at Hinganghat, one at Jubbulpore, one at Pulgaon, and one at Raj-Nandgaon in the Nandgaon State. Comparative statistics are given below:\n\n|                | 1880-1 | 1890-1 | 1901-2 | 1903-4 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Number of mills| 1      | 3      | 7      | 7      |\n| \" looms        | 240    | 805    | 2,144  | 2,401  |\n| \" spindles     | 30,000 | 72,080 | 155,682| 176,684|\n| Average number of hands employed | 1,646  | 4,202  | 10,146 | 9,763  |\n\nThe Empress Mills at Nagpur were the first to be opened, in 1877. The Pulgaon and one of the Hinganghat mills have only spinning apparatus, while the other five combine spinning and weaving. The seven mills contain altogether 2,401 looms and 176,684 spindles, and their aggregate capital is 97 lakhs. The aggregate out-turn of the mills in 1904 was 199,969 cwt. of yarn and 68,427 cwt. of cloth. The yarn is generally sold to weavers in the Central Provinces and also in Bengal, while the cloth, besides being disposed of locally, is sent to other Provinces of India, and that of the Empress Mills to China and Japan. Besides the mills, the Province has 100 cotton-ginning and 47 pressing factories, 65 of these being, however, not shown in the returns as they do not come within the scope of the Factories Act. These factories are situated principally in the cotton-growing Districts of Nagpur, Wardha, and Nimar, and the majority of them have been opened since 1891, in which year only 16 were returned. The factories contain 1,900 gins and 47 presses, and their estimated capital is 72 lakhs. The other factories include a brewery at Jubbulpore, opened in 1897; a match factory at Kot\u0101 in Bilaspur, opened in 1902; Messrs. Burn & Co.'s pottery works at Jubbulpore, started in 1892, which manufacture tiles, piping, and earthenware vessels; and a Government brick and tile factory at Warora, turning out fire-clay bricks and tiles. A Central Gun-carriage Factory for all India was opened at Jubbulpore in 1905. The average daily number of persons employed in factories in 1904 was 33,346. This figure, though small, has been sufficient, in combination with other industries, to raise the wages of daily labour in Nagpur, Wardha, and Nimar. The supply of unskilled labour is obtained from the local market, the lowest rates for ordinary male workmen being from Rs. 6 to Rs. 8 a month.\n\nPrevious to the construction of railways, the Province was isolated to a marked degree from other parts of India; large tracts of country were covered by impenetrable forest, there were few towns of any importance, and any large volume of internal traffic was impracticable except along a few main routes. The records of earlier years show that in many parts of the\nProvince after a good harvest grain actually rotted as it lay. At the time of annexation a considerable trade had however sprung up between Nagpur and the Narbad\u0101 valley and Bombay; grain, oilseeds, raw cotton, and the silk-bordered cloths woven in the Nagpur plain being the staple articles of export, which were carried for hundreds of miles in country carts or on pack-bullocks. Trade was further impeded by the feeling of insecurity arising from the greed of the rulers of the State or their agents. The connexion by railway of Jubbulpore with Calcutta, and of Nagpur with Bombay, which was effected in 1867, is the most important fact in the commercial history of the Province.\n\nBetween 1863 and 1866 the average value of exports was about 1\u00bd crores, and of imports about 2 crores. Their combined value rose to 4\u00bd crores in 1872, 7\u00bd in 1882, 8\u00bd in 1892, and 14\u00bd crores in 1903\u20134. In the first few years of this period the large imports of railway material caused the total value of imports to exceed that of exports. But this has not happened since, except in the famine years of 1897 and 1900, when the quantity of food-grains imported again temporarily turned the balance of trade against the Province. From 1873 to 1888 the excess value of exports over imports averaged between half a crore and a crore; from 1888 to 1896 it averaged about 1\u00bd crores; while in 1903\u20134 it was more than 3 crores, or about Rs. 2\u20138 per head of population.\n\nThe value of exports in 1903\u20134 was 8-92 crores, or about Rs. 7\u20138 per head of population. Since 1863 the value of exports has increased by more than fivefold. During the last twenty years their value has doubled, while their weight has increased from 450,000 to nearly a million tons. About half the total export trade is with Bombay Port, while of the remainder Bengal takes over a crore, Berar 77 lakhs, and Bombay and the United Provinces about 50 lakhs each. Only 40 lakhs goes to Calcutta. Of the exports, 2\u00bd crores or one-third of the total value consists of raw cotton, 57 lakhs (6 per cent.) of yarn and cotton piece-goods, nearly 2 crores (21 per cent.) of grain and pulse, 85 lakhs (nearly 10 per cent.) of oilseeds, and 64 lakhs (7 per cent.) of provisions.\n\nRaw cotton is, therefore, at present by far the most important product of the Province, but its pre-eminent position is entirely a feature of recent years. From 1863 to 1868, at the time of the American Civil War, the value of cotton exported rose to nearly a crore of rupees; it fell gradually until in 1883\u20138 the amount was only 19 lakhs, while in more recent years the demand in the European market, and the consequent rise in price, have led to an enormous expansion. The trade in Indian yarn and cotton piece-goods has also increased largely during the last decade. The exports of the former in 1903\u20134 were valued at 25 lakhs, and of the latter at nearly 31 lakhs, as compared with 3 lakhs and 15 lakhs in 1891. Both articles are sent mainly to other parts of India. The hand-woven silk-bordered cloths of the Nagpur country\nare exported in considerable numbers. The trade in grain fluctuates largely. Of the total value of 1.92 crores exported in 1903-4, wheat contributed 111 lakhs, rice 47 lakhs, and pulses 32 lakhs. Ten years ago the wheat trade was considered to be the backbone of Provincial commerce, and the wheat-growing districts of the Narbad\u0101 valley to be the richest and most prosperous. The average exports for 1888-92 were worth nearly two crores. In 1893 the exports of rice reached a crore of rupees. This figure has not been approached, however, since 1895. Gram, jow\u0101r, and urad are also exported. Of 85 lakhs of oilseeds exported in 1903-4, linseed contributed 26 lakhs and til or sesamum 44 lakhs. The bulk of these oilseeds exported is not much greater now than twenty years ago, but their value has risen greatly, while til has increased in both value and bulk at the expense of linseed. The principal article included in the remaining 15 odd lakhs is cotton-seed, which has very recently come into prominence as an export. In 1902-3 the total exports of oilseeds were 135 lakhs. Of the exports of provisions the most important article is ghi. Other articles are various fruit products, such as mahu\u0101 flowers which are sent to Bombay, Ber\u0101r, and Central India for distilling country liquor, honey, arrowroot, and chironji, the fruit of the ach\u0101r-tree (Buchanania latifolia), used for sweetmeats. Another important industry has recently sprung up in the export of jerked meat, which is sent to Burma. Exports of hides and skins have been regrettably large in recent years, owing to the heavy mortality of cattle in the famines. Among other important articles of export are dyes and tans, chiefly myrabolams, lac, and hemp (san). Exports of railway plant consist principally of wooden sleepers. The exports of wood and timber are distributed among the surrounding Provinces, Bombay being the best customer. Teak and s\u0101l timber and bamboos are the chief items. Among minor articles of export may be noticed fresh fruits and vegetables, which consist chiefly of Nagpur oranges sent in large quantities to other parts of India, and occasionally to England.\n\nThe total imports in 1903-4 amounted to 5.76 crores, or Rs. 4-14 per head of population. Since 1865 the value of imports has about trebled, while since 1881 it has increased by 60 per cent. About 2\u00bd crores was received from Bombay Port, 79 lakhs from Bengal, 76 lakhs from Bombay Presidency, approximately 50 lakhs each from R\u0101jput\u0101na and the United Provinces, and 32 lakhs from Calcutta. Of the total imports, yarn and cotton piece-goods, salt, sugar, metal, provisions, grain, and oils are the most important.\n\nThe demand for English yarn and cotton cloth has not as yet been adversely affected by the local mill industry, as the finer counts of thread are not produced; but imports of Indian thread and cloth are either stationary or declining. About two-thirds of the salt consumed in the\nProvince is sea-salt from Bombay, while the northern Districts take salt from the Sambhar Lake, and since the opening of the East Coast Railway Madras sea-salt has been imported into Chhattisgarh. The imports of sugar have more than doubled during the last twenty years, and now amount to 37,516 tons. Refined sugar comes almost entirely from Bombay Port, and the greater part of it is probably produced in the Mauritius. The Province now obtains large quantities of gur or unrefined sugar from Bengal and the United Provinces. The imports of metals have doubled in the last ten, and trebled in the last twenty years, the figures for 1903-4 being the highest on record. Large imports of metals are a certain index of prosperity. Out of a total value of 54 lakhs, manufactured iron and steel account for 23, other imports of iron and steel for 16, and brass and copper for 11 lakhs. The provisions imported consist chiefly of dried fruits and nuts, coco-nuts being the most important item. Areca-nuts and chillies form the bulk of the imports under spices, while ginger, cardamoms, cloves, pepper, and asafoetida are other articles. Rice, principally from Burma, constituted about one-sixth of the total imports of grain and pulse. During the last decade the kerosene oil imported has risen from 135,000 to 292,000 cwt.\n\nThe trade of the Province is now almost entirely concentrated on the railways, and the important roads are those leading from the great producing tracts to railway stations. Imports are mainly consigned to the large towns, owing to both their own demand and the facilities which they afford for distribution to retailers. Exports, however, are sent away from a larger number of stations, several small places favourably situated on main roads having an important trade. Raw cotton is principally exported from Nagpur, Hinganghat, Pulgaon, Kamptee, and Khandwa; grain from Nagpur, Kamptee, Raipur, Jubbulpore, Gondia, Saugor, Damoh, and Harda; and metals are distributed from Nagpur, Kamptee, and Katni. All the large towns have a considerable import trade, and of the smaller towns Katni, Wardha, and Pulgaon are the most important.\n\nA large proportion of the export trade in grain and oilseeds is conducted by a European firm, and the remainder by Marwari Baniyas and Cutchi Muhammadans. Baniyas also trade in ghee (clarified butter), and largely in cotton. In Chanda and Wardha there are a number of Komatis or Madrasi Baniyas. Cutchis conduct a large part of the import trade in cloths, salt, kerosene oil, and general merchandise, while Bombay Bohras import stationery, glassware, small goods, iron and hardware. Parsis are general merchants, and deal in foreign goods, wines, and crockery. Several European companies are engaged in the timber trade. Grain for export is not usually sold in the weekly markets, the transactions at which are mainly retail; the cultivators either carry it in their own carts to the exporting stations, or small\nretail dealers, principally Telis, Kalars, and Baniyas, go round and buy it up in villages. Cotton is generally taken by the cultivators direct to the exporting stations.\n\nThe railway systems traversing the Province are the Great Indian Peninsula and Indian Midland, the Bombay, Baroda, and Central India, the East Indian, and the Bengal-Nagpur. Of Communications, these, the Great Indian Peninsula line is now a state line, but leased to a company for working; the Indian Midland is the property of the company of that name, but is worked by the Great Indian Peninsula Company; the East Indian is a state line, but leased to a company; the Bengal-Nagpur line is the property of a guaranteed company; and the section of the Bombay, Baroda, and Central India within the Central Provinces is a state line leased to a company.\n\nThe two main routes between Bombay and Calcutta traverse the Province north and south of the Satpura plateau. The north-eastern line of the Great Indian Peninsula from Bombay divides at Bhusawal junction into two branches, one going north and north-east for 339 miles to a terminus at Jubbulpore, where it meets the East Indian, and the other proceeding almost due east through Berar to Nagpur, where the Bengal-Nagpur line to Calcutta commences. The Jubbulpore line runs through the whole length of the Narbad valley, comprising the Districts of Nimar, Hoshangabad, Narsinghpur, and Jubbulpore. At Khandwa, 353 miles from Bombay, a metre-gauge line worked by the Bombay, Baroda, and Central India takes off and proceeds north-west through Indore to Ajmer, with a length of 29 miles in the Central Provinces. Itarsi, 464 miles from Bombay, is the junction with the Indian Midland line to Cawnpore and Agra, which runs north through Hoshangabad, the Bhopal State, and Saugor District, while at Jubbulpore the East Indian line begins, and runs for 70 miles in the Central Provinces towards Allahabad. From Bina, on the Indian Midland line, a branch of 163 miles runs to Katni on the East Indian, serving the Districts of Saugor and Damoh. The Nagpur branch of the Great Indian Peninsula enters the Central Provinces at Pulgaon and runs for 70 miles through Wardha and Nagpur Districts to Nagpur, 520 miles from Bombay. From Wardha a branch of 45 miles leads to Warora in Chanda. At Nagpur the Bengal-Nagpur system begins, and runs through Bhandara, Raipur, Bilaspur, and several Feudatory States towards Calcutta, with a length of 417 miles in the Province. An extension of the Bengal-Nagpur Railway on the gauge of 2 feet 6 inches from Gondia on the main line, 601 miles from Bombay, to connect with Jubbulpore, was opened in 1905. It passes through Balaghat, Mandla, and Seoni Districts, and has branches through Seoni to Chhindwara and to Mandla, with a total length of 255\n\n1 The Mandla branch had not been completed in 1906.\nmiles, thus bringing the greater part of the S\u0101tpur\u0101 plateau within easy distance of a railway. From Raipur another narrow-gauge branch of 56 miles leads south to Dhamtari and R\u0101jim in Raipur District; and from Bil\u0101spur a connecting line on the broad gauge runs north for 85 miles to Katni on the East Indian. Except where it has been otherwise stated, all lines are on the standard gauge of 5 feet 6 inches. There are at present no double lines, but a section of the Great Indian Peninsula west of It\u0101rs\u012b is about to be doubled.\n\nThe lines from Bhus\u0101wal to N\u0101gpur and from Jubbulpore to All\u0101h\u0101b\u0101d were the first to be constructed, and were opened in 1867, the Bhus\u0101wal-Jubbulpore line following shortly afterwards in 1870. The Indian Midland line from It\u0101rs\u012b to Bhop\u0101l was constructed in 1882, and the Bhop\u0101l-Jh\u0101nsi section in 1889. The main line of the Bengal-N\u0101gpur Railway was opened in 1888, being an extension of the Chhattisgarh State Railway which had been constructed by Government on the metre gauge to R\u0101j-N\u0101ndgaon, and was made over to the company, converted to the broad gauge, and extended to connect with Asansol on the East Indian, and subsequently direct to Calcutta. The B\u012bna-Katni connexion on the Indian Midland was constructed in 1899.\n\nIn 1904 the Province had thus 1,419 miles of railway open and a further 178 under construction, making a total of 1,597 miles, of which 1,257 were on the broad gauge, 29 on the metre gauge, and 311 on narrower gauges. This is equivalent to 54 square miles of country for one mile of railway in British Districts, and 73 for the Province as a whole. In 1891, 1,094 miles of broad gauge and 29 of metre gauge were open. With the exception of Bet\u016bl District on the S\u0101tpur\u0101 plateau, the greater part of Ch\u0101nda, and the southern Feudatory States, the railway communications of the Province may be said to be fairly complete. Among projected lines may be mentioned a branch of the Bengal-N\u0101gpur from Bil\u0101spur to Mandl\u0101, the embankment of which has been partially constructed as a famine relief work; an extension from Gondi\u0101 to Ch\u0101nda on the same line, with a link from Bramhapuri to N\u0101gpur, to serve the south of N\u0101gpur and the north of Ch\u0101nda Districts; a branch line from Chhindw\u0101ra to the Pench valley coal-fields; a line from Raipur to Vizianagram; a loop-line from Nagpur to Amraoti, from some point on which a connexion will be taken through Bet\u016bl to It\u0101rs\u012b; a branch line from N\u0101gpur to R\u0101mtek; and an extension of the Wardh\u0101-Waror\u0101 line through Ch\u0101nda to a point on the Nizam's State Railway in Hyder\u0101b\u0101d. The construction of a line from Waror\u0101 through Ch\u0101nda to a new coal-field at Ball\u0101lpur, 6 miles from this town, has been begun by the Great Indian Peninsula Company.\n\nPrevious to the construction of railways, the main trunk routes of the Province were the road from N\u0101gpur to Jubbulpore through Seoni,\nthe great eastern road from Nagpur to Raipur and Sambalpur and on to Cuttack, the southern road from Nagpur to Chanda through Jam and Warora, the old Bombay road from Jubbulpore through Nimar, the Jubbulpore, Damoh, and Saugor road, the Jubbulpore, Mandla, and Bilaspur road, and the north-western road from Nagpur to Betul and Itarsi. Other main routes were those from Nagpur to Chhindwara and Pipariya, from Seoni to Katangi and Tumsar, from Saugor to Kareli, from Nagpur to Umre and Mul, and from Raipur through Dhamtari to Jagdalpur. These latter roads were important railway feeders for some time after the construction of the through lines of rail, but they have generally been superseded by the extensions of the last two decades. The construction of the railways has entirely removed the importance of the old trunk routes, except along certain lengths where they serve as feeders. One or two of them are no longer maintained to the same standard as formerly, and with the exception of the road from Nagpur to Jubbulpore there is now no thoroughly good trunk road in the Province. The important roads at present are those which connect rich tracts in the interior with the railways; and as the railways have frequently followed the line of trunk roads, the feeders are generally small cross-roads. During the last decade there has been a remarkable development of road communications, consequent on the amount of work undertaken for famine relief. The length of metalled roads has increased from 536 miles in 1892 to 1,646 in 1904\u20135, and that of embanked roads from 2,133 miles to 2,967. The total length of metalled and embanked roads is now 4,613 miles, or at the rate of one mile for 18 square miles of country in British Districts. The annual expenditure on the maintenance of these roads is 8.43 lakhs. Nearly 900 miles of surface roads are also maintained at a cost of Rs. 24,000. Surface or unembanked roads are under the charge of District councils, while all others are maintained by the Public Works department. Much progress has also been made during the last decade in developing the communications of the large zamindaris and Feudatory States of Chhattisgarh, under the superintendence of the Engineer of the specially created Chhattisgarh States division. This territory, comprising 41,618 square miles, is the wildest and most backward part of the Province, and was till recently almost destitute of routes fit for wheeled traffic. Since 1893, 681 miles of gravelled roads and 763 miles of surface roads have been constructed, the funds being provided by the estates through which they pass. These roads are excluded from the totals given above. The cost of a country cart drawn by two bullocks is about Rs. 40 on an average, and the ordinary load along roads is 14 cwt.\n\nThe Central Provinces are included in the Central Provinces and Berar Postal Circle under a Deputy-Postmaster-General. The statistics (see Table VII, p. 106) show a large advance in postal business since\nthe number of post offices in the Province having increased from 186 to 689, of letter-boxes from 157 to 566, and of miles of postal communication from 4,465 to 8,411. More than 7 million letters were delivered in 1903-4 as against 5\u00bd millions in 1880-1, 6 million postcards as against half a million, and 147,000 parcels as against 40,000. The value of money orders issued has increased from 30 to 109 lakhs. These figures relate to both the Imperial and the District post. The latter system provided postal communications in British Districts for magisterial and police purposes, the upkeep of which was not warranted under the commercial principles of the Post Office, and funds were obtained from a cess levied at the rate of one per cent. on the land revenue. In 1906 the cess was abolished, and the cost is now included in the Imperial budget. Postal establishments in Feudatory States are paid from State funds, and were also treated as part of the District Post. In 1903-4, 141 post offices and 2,554 miles of mail lines in British Districts, and 22 post offices and 922 miles of mail lines in Feudatory States, were maintained under this system.\n\nAt present the harvests may be said to be entirely dependent on the rainfall. A complete failure of the rains, such as occurred in 1899-1900, will destroy both the harvests and cause a universal famine. Such a failure is, however, believed to be unique. The rainfall of June, July, and August is as a rule fairly reliable, and has only failed completely in 1868 and 1899. In 1902 there was a drought in August. Very heavy or excessive rain, on the other hand, during these months is naturally not infrequent, and in some Districts may occasion substantial damage to cotton and jowar; but there is no record of distress having arisen from this cause. The most critical period for the crops comprises the months of September and October, when about 9\u00bd inches should be received. This rain is necessary both for the ripening rice harvest and to enable the land to be prepared for sowing the spring grains. It is especially capricious; and while the full average is required to ensure the success of both harvests, the actual fall in one or other of these months has been more than 25 per cent. short of the average nineteen times in thirty-three years. Of the famines or scarcities for which information is available, those of 1833, 1886, 1896, and 1897 were caused by shortness of the late rains, while in 1899 an average fall in these months would have reduced a universal famine to local distress. It is especially to remedy the deficiencies of the rainfall in September and October that irrigation is required. If the rainfall up to the end of October has been satisfactory, the success of both harvests is assured against deficiency of rain, though showers in November or December are requisite for bumper spring crops. These, however, may still be spoilt by excessive rainfall in the winter months, which will induce rust or blight. Such excessive rain was,\nas will be seen, responsible for the local distress which occurred in 1819, in 1823-7 in Seoni and Mandla, in 1854-5 in Saugor and Damoh, and in 1893, 1894, and 1895 in the northern Districts generally. The spring harvest is, however, of far less importance than the autumn harvest, and there is also no single crop which so overshadows the rest as rice does the other autumn grains.\n\nThe earliest scarcities of which accounts are available resulted from political disturbances rather than climatic causes. War and its effects account for distress which prevailed in the upper Narbada valley during the years 1771, 1783, and 1809. It is recorded that in 1771 wheat sold in Narsinghpur at 10 lb. to the rupee. In 1803 a failure of the rains caused a famine in Nimar and Hoshangabad, which had already suffered greatly from the inroads of Sindhia's armies. The famine is still known in Nimar as the 'Mahakal,' when grain sold at 1 lb. to the rupee or about two or three hundred times its price in seasons of prosperity. In 1818-19 the Nagpur country and the Districts north of the Narbada suffered from a famine caused by the failure of the autumn rains and excessive rain during the following cold season. Acute famine prevailed for months in these localities, and in Jubbulpore wheat sold at 8 lb. to the rupee. In Nagpur many of the poorer cultivators are reported to have sold their children into slavery. From 1823 to 1827 the Districts of Seoni and Mandla suffered from a succession of short crops due to floods, hail, and blight; and many villages were deserted. In 1825-6, according to oral tradition, famine attended with loss of life occurred in Nagpur, and it is said that many people died after eating the cooked food which was doled out to them at the Raja's palace. In 1828-9 there was a famine in Raipur and Bilaspur, the price of grain rising from about 300 to 24 lb. per rupee. In 1832-3 excessive rain followed by drought was the cause of severe distress in the Narbad valley, the Nagpur country, and Berar. Heavy mortality occurred in Betul, and 5,000 people are said to have died in the city of Nagpur. In Wardha children were sold for 10 lb. of grain. The following year, owing to a failure of the autumn rain, the spring crop area of Jubbulpore District was left practically unsown and prices reached 16 lb. per rupee. Grain was imported by Government agency into Seoni and Mandla. In 1834-5 a partial failure occurred in Chattisgarh, and, in spite of the export of grain being prohibited, prices rose to 15 or 20 times their normal level. Drought in 1845 caused severe distress in Nimar and Chattisgarh; and in 1854-5 a visitation of rust destroyed the wheat crop of the northern Districts, and is still well remembered by the people as a parallel to the similar disaster of 1894-5. Parents sold their children in Damoh, and many deaths from starvation were recorded in Saugor. In 1868, the year of the Bundelkhand famine, the rains ended abruptly a month before the\ndue time; but a heavy fall in September saved the situation over the greater part of the country, and acute distress was confined to the Vindhyan Districts, the Wainganga rice tracts, and Chhattisgarh. Distress was, however, severe in these areas. Hundreds of deaths were reported to have occurred from starvation, and the ordinary mortality is estimated to have been trebled. About 17 lakhs was expended on relief.\n\nThe famine of 1868-9 was followed by a period of years of prosperity, broken only by the failure in 1886 of the rice crop of Chhattisgarh. From 1893 commenced the recent cycle of bad years. In that year, and in 1894 and 1895, the spring crops of the northern Districts were spoiled by excessive winter rain. In 1894 the wheat was almost entirely destroyed by rust in Saugor and Damoh, and distress ensued. Road works were opened, but the numbers on them never reached 20,000, and only about a lakh was expended on relief. Both in 1894 and 1895 the rice crop was also severely damaged on the threshing-floors by the late rains. In 1895 the monsoon stopped abruptly in the middle of September; the autumn crops were poor, and the spring harvest realized about half a normal yield on a diminished area. Four years of poor harvests thus preceded the failure of 1896, when the rains, which up to then had been plentiful and even excessive, stopped suddenly at the end of August. The effect of the drought was the destruction of the autumn crops, with the exception of irrigated rice, cotton, and jowar. The spring crops were fair, but owing to the dryness of the soil only half the normal area was sown. The all-round out-turn was 56 per cent. of an average crop, but the distress was greatly aggravated by the failures of the preceding years. Severe famine prevailed throughout 1897, except in Nimar, Chanda, and Sambalpur, which partially escaped. Direct expenditure on famine relief was about 1\u00bd crores; and indirect expenditure, famine loans, remissions of land revenue, and charitable relief made up another crore. The Provincial death-rate for the year was 69 per 1,000, compared with 32\u00b74 during the decade ending 1891; the mortality was especially severe during the monsoon months. Owing partly to the wide area over which this famine extended, and partly to the deficiency of transport, prices ruled high, the extreme point reached being 12\u00bd lb. per rupee in Balaghat. The largest number relieved was 703,000, or 8\u00b75 per cent. of the population affected, on the 29th of May. The famine of 1897 was followed by two years of fairly good harvests, but in 1899 occurred the most complete failure of the monsoon ever known. Only five Districts received more than half their average rainfall, and five received only a third. The wheat crop was above half an average in six of the northern Districts; but over the rest of the country both crops failed completely, the all-round out-turn for the Province being\nonly a quarter of the normal. Famine prevailed in all Districts from October, 1899, to November, 1900; and the deficiency of the rainfall led to severe epidemics of cholera, dysentery, diarrhoea, and other diseases resulting from bad water. The administration of this famine was extremely liberal and efficient, the direct expenditure being nearly 4\u00bd crores, while indirect expenditure and remissions of the revenue added another crore and 30 lakhs. The numbers on relief exceeded 2\u00bd millions, or 23 per cent. of the population of the affected tract, in July, 1900, and the total number of units relieved for one day was 556 millions. In spite of the greater severity of the famine, prices were generally lower by from 1 to 3 lb. per rupee than in 1897, the imports of Bengal rice assisting materially to keep them down. The highest price for the cheapest food-grain was 14\u00bd lb. per rupee in Chhindw\u0101ra. The mortality for the year was 57 per 1,000, and was greatly aggravated by diseases due to the scarcity and bad quality of water. After two more fairly good seasons a prolonged break in the rains between the last week of July and the last week of August, 1902, caused a failure of the rice crop in Raipur and the Waingang\u0101 valley. Famine was confined to Raipur, which reaped only a third of an average crop.\n\nApart from the direct organization of relief, the remission of revenue, and the grant of loans to agriculturists for seed and cattle, the protective measures taken by Government consist of the extension of irrigation and communications. Irrigation is as yet in its infancy in the Province; and though considerable strides have been made in the last few years, it can at best only slightly mitigate the effects of a failure of the rains. The opening up of the Province by railways, so as to provide cheap transport to tracts liable to be affected, has been proceeding rapidly during the last two decades, and with the completion of the S\u0101tpur\u0101 line will be practically complete so far as British Districts are concerned. In 1897 grain had to be imported by Government agency into parts of Mandla, B\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t, and Sironch\u0101, and these areas, with the exception of the small Sironch\u0101 tract, will be protected by the S\u0101tpur\u0101 railway. As regards the direct administration of relief, a revised Famine Code has been compiled, embodying the experience gained in the two great famines, and detailing the whole course of procedure to be followed. Famine programmes of works for each District are drawn up and annually revised, each programme containing large public works, village works, and forest works, which are especially suitable for the primitive tribes. The programme provides work for six months for not less than 20 per cent. of the population of the District, except in tracts adequately protected by irrigation, where a half of this provision is held to be sufficient.\n\nThe administration of the Central Provinces is conducted by a Chief\nCommissioner, who is the chief controlling revenue and executive authority. He is assisted by three secretaries, two under secretaries and an assistant secretary. The area of British territory comprised in the Province is 82,093 square miles, with a population of 9,216,185; and it is divided for administrative purposes into four revenue Divisions, each controlled by a Commissioner. The average area of a Division is 20,500 square miles, and the population 2,250,000 persons. Three of the Divisions contain five Districts, and one (Chhattisgarh) three. The Commissioner of the Division supervises the working of all departments of Government in his Division, except those outside the sphere of the Local Administration, through the Deputy-Commissioners of Districts, who are his immediate subordinates. Till recently the Commissioners also exercised civil and criminal jurisdiction. The principal heads of Provincial departments are the Commissioner of Settlements and Land Records, the Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals and Sanitary Commissioner, the Inspector-General of Police, the Inspector-General of Prisons, the Director of Public Instruction, the Commissioner of Excise and Miscellaneous Revenue, who is also Inspector-General of Registration, and the Director of Agriculture. The Controller and the Deputy-Postmaster-General represent Imperial departments under the Government of India. Berar is now included in the jurisdiction of all these officers.\n\nThe Province is divided into 18 Districts\\(^1\\), with an average area of 4,561 square miles and a population of 512,010 persons. Each District is in charge of a Deputy-Commissioner, who is the chief revenue authority and also District Magistrate, and exercises the usual functions of a District officer. The District forests are managed by a Forest officer, usually a member of the Imperial Forest service, over whom the Deputy-Commissioner has certain powers of supervision, particularly in regard to matters affecting the welfare of the people. Each District has a Civil Surgeon, who is generally also Superintendent of the District jail, and whose work is supervised by the Deputy-Commissioner in respect of village sanitation, the registration of vital statistics, and the financial management of the Jail and dispensaries. The Deputy-Commissioner is also marriage registrar, and manages the estates in his District which are under the Court of Wards.\n\nIn his revenue and criminal work the Deputy-Commissioner is assisted by \\((a)\\) one or more Assistant Commissioners, or members of the Indian Civil Service; \\((b)\\) one or more Extra-Assistant Commissioners, or members of the Provincial civil service, usually natives of India, but including a few Europeans and Eurasians; and \\((c)\\) by\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) In 1905-6 the new District of Drug was constituted from portions of Raipur and Bilaspur Districts; but, at the same time, Sambalpur District was transferred to Bengal. The total number of Districts therefore remains at 18.\ntahsildars and naib-tahsildars, or members of the Subordinate service who are nearly always natives of India. The number of Assistant Commissioners on ordinary duty in 1904 was 21, and of Extra-Assistant Commissioners 100, giving 7 officers to each District. Recently the subdivisional system prevailing in most other Provinces has been introduced into the Central Provinces. According to this, an Assistant or Extra-Assistant Commissioner is placed in charge of a subdivision consisting of one or two tahsils, with the powers of a Subdivisional Magistrate under the Criminal Procedure Code, extended powers under the Revenue Law, and authority to supervise the revenue and police officials. In 1904, 22 subdivisions were formed, the subdivisional officers with one or two exceptions residing at the District head-quarters but touring in their subdivisions during the open season.\n\nThe District is divided for administrative purposes into two or more tahsils, each of which has a tahsildar and naib- or deputy-tahsildar with a tahsil office, and except in the case of head-quarter tahsils a sub-treasury. The number of tahsils in 1906 was 53, or an average of three to a District. The average area of a tahsil is 1,550 square miles, and the population 173,890. The tahsildar is the Deputy-Commissioner's right hand in his revenue and executive work; and, besides being responsible for the collection of the revenue and the distribution and repayment of land improvement and agricultural loans, he makes inquiries and carries out orders in matters of revenue law and administration. The tahsildar is also a criminal magistrate, but has usually no civil work. The naib-tahsildar has no special functions apart from those of the tahsildar. He is usually not a magistrate, but sometimes tries civil cases.\n\nIn each village one or more lambardars are the representatives of the proprietary body or malguzars when the ownership of the village is divided into shares, and their duty is to collect and pay in the Government revenue. The lambardar, or, if there are several, one of them, is also mukaddam or executive headman of the village. If he is non-resident, he must appoint an agent or mukaddam gam\u00e2sha to act for him. The mukaddam exercises the usual duties of a village headman, but has no magisterial powers, and except by the exercise of his personal authority, which, however, is frequently considerable, cannot coerce or restrain the residents.\n\nEach District has a Land Record staff, controlled under the Deputy-Commissioner by a native superintendent, and consisting of two grades of officials, revenue inspectors and patwiris. There is on an average one patwari to 8 villages, and a revenue inspector to every 25 patwiris, the\n\n1 These figures include the civil judicial staff, now designated District and Subordinate Judges.\n2 The word lambardar is a corrupt formation from the English word 'number,'\ntotal number of revenue inspectors being 205, and of patw\u0101ris 4,927. The patw\u0101ri is the village surveyor and accountant, and his office is an ancient one, but he is now a paid and trained Government servant, instead of being a dependent of the landowner as he formerly was. Each revenue inspector is in charge of a number of patw\u0101ris' circles, and his duties consist in training the patw\u0101ris in surveying and the preparation of the annual returns. The Land Record staff also furnish a most valuable agency for the supply of accurate information in times of anxiety for the harvest, and for the organization of famine relief when this becomes necessary.\n\nThe Province contains 15 Feudatory States, covering an area of 31,188 square miles with a population of 1,631,140 persons. One of the States, Makrai, lies within Hoshang\u0101b\u0101d District; the remainder are situated in the Chhattisgarh Division, to the different Districts of which they were formerly attached. Their relations with Government are controlled by a Political Agent. The States vary greatly in size and importance, Sakti, the smallest, having an area of 138 square miles, and Bastar, the largest, of 13,062. They are administered by hereditary chiefs, who hold on conditions of loyalty and good government set forth in patents and acknowledgements of fealty, but are nominally free from direct interference save in the case of sentences of death, which require the Chief Commissioner's confirmation\\(^1\\). But, as a matter of fact, the Government has exercised a very large amount of control, owing mainly to the frequency with which the States have been taken under direct management, because of either the minority or the misconduct of the chief. During a minority the affairs of the State are generally managed by a Superintendent under the control of the Political Agent. In some cases also the assent of Government to the accession of a new chief is made contingent on his employing an officer nominated by Government as his Diwan or minister. The Superintendents and Divans appointed by Government are usually officers specially selected from the Provincial or Subordinate service according to the size of the State. In practice, as many of the State officials have received a legal training in Government service, the ordinary criminal and civil law are applied, magisterial and civil powers being delegated by the chief. In several States a cadastral survey has been carried out and the system of revenue settlement prescribed for British Districts introduced. The revenue is settled with the village headmen, who have no proprietary rights, but receive a drawback on the collections. The States pay a tribute to Government which amounted in the aggregate to 2.43 lakhs in 1904.\n\nThe legislative authority for the Central Provinces is the Council of\n\n\\(^1\\) In eight States sentences of imprisonment for over seven years also require confirmation.\nthe Governor-General of India for the purpose of making Laws and Regulations. The principal Acts passed since 1880 which specially affect the Central Provinces, excluding repealed Acts, are the following:\u2014The Central Provinces Land Revenue Act, 1881, amended by supplementary Acts in 1889 and 1898; the Central Provinces Tenancy Act, 1898, amended by Act XVI of 1899; the Central Provinces Local Self-Government Act of 1883; the Central Provinces Civil Courts Act, II of 1904; the Central Provinces Government Wards Act, XXII of 1885, amended in 1899; the Central Provinces Municipal Act, XVI of 1903; and the Central Provinces Village Sanitation Act of 1889, amended by Act XI of 1902.\n\nBy the Civil Courts Act of 1904 the civil has finally been separated from the executive department. The civil staff consists of four Divisional Judges having jurisdiction in each Division, 18 District Judges in Districts, 30 Subordinate Judges, and 50 Munsifs. Tahsildars and naib-tahsildars try rent suits, but rarely exercise other civil powers. The court of a Munsif has original jurisdiction up to Rs. 500, and that of a Subordinate Judge up to Rs. 5,000. The District Judge has unlimited original jurisdiction except in proceedings under the Indian Divorce Act, which lie in the court of the Divisional Judge. Appeals from Munsifs and Subordinate Judges up to Rs. 1,000 lie in the court of the District Judge, and above that in the court of the Divisional Judge. Appeals from the District Judge up to Rs. 5,000 are heard in the courts of the Divisional Judge, and above that in the court of the Judicial Commissioner. The Judicial Commissioner is the highest court of civil appeal, and except in cases against European British subjects, when the High Court of Bombay has jurisdiction, the highest court of criminal appeal. He is assisted by an Additional Judicial Commissioner for the Central Provinces, and another for Berar.\n\nThe administration of criminal justice was formerly entirely in the hands of Commissioners and of the District staff. Commissioners have now no criminal powers as such, and their place as Sessions Judges has been taken by Divisional Judges. Deputy-Commissioners are also District Magistrates, and have power to try all offences not punishable with death. In the more important Districts selected Assistant and Extra-Assistant Commissioners are also invested with this power. Otherwise these officers usually exercise first-class magisterial powers. Tahsildars are usually second-class magistrates, with power to impose sentences of whipping. In addition to the stipendiary magistrates, a number of non-official native gentlemen have been appointed honorary magistrates. The criminal judiciary includes the Judicial Commissioner's court, which is a High Court for the Central Provinces, four courts of Session, 18 courts of District Magistrates, 64 courts of magis-\ntrates of the first class, 76 of the second class, and 46 of the third class, or 209 in all. These figures include 78 benches of honorary magistrates, with 260 members. Appeals from magistrates of the second and third class lie to the District Magistrate, while certain other first-class magistrates have also been invested with the power of hearing appeals. Appeals from magistrates of the first class and from District Magistrates lie to the Court of Session, and from the Court of Session to the Judicial Commissioner.\n\nThe marked features of the statistics of civil litigation (Table VIII, p. 106) are the large increases in the number of suits for the first twenty-five years after the constitution of the Province, and the stationary or declining state of litigation in the next fifteen years. In 1862 the total number of suits filed was 24,666. They had increased to 89,903 in 1881, and to 112,665 in 1886. In subsequent years there have been considerable decreases, and in 1904 the total was 79,455. The character of litigation has been substantially the same throughout this period, the large majority of suits, amounting in 1904 to 69 per cent. of the total, being for the recovery of money or movable property. Of the other classes, suits for immovable property constitute 6 per cent. of the total, and those under the rent law 15 per cent. Suits are generally of very trifling value, 59 per cent. of the total not exceeding Rs. 50 and only 4 per cent. being above Rs. 500. During the decade ending 1900 the average number of appeals filed annually was 6,960, or 7 per cent. of the number of suits. Of these, 652, or 9 per cent. of the total, were filed in the court of the Judicial Commissioner; 370, or 5 per cent., in the Divisional Courts; and 5,938, or 85 per cent., in the District Courts.\n\nThe conclusion indicated by the statistics of crime (Table IX, p. 107) during the forty years for which they are available is that the number of offences committed annually has remained remarkably constant, allowing for variations due to abnormal conditions such as famine. The number of persons annually brought to trial has been about 40,000. In 1866 it was 41,700, the average for the decade ending 1890 was 39,200, and that for the decade ending 1900 nearly 45,000, the last figures being increased by the abnormal statistics of crime in three famine years. The statistics of the last few years show an apparent decrease in crime, the number of persons tried in 1904 being only 35,000. The decrease is principally in offences against property, only 8,000 persons being tried under this head in 1904, as against an average of 13,700 for the decade ending 1890, and 19,000 for that ending 1900. This decrease may be partly real, but is also to be accounted for by recent orders forbidding the investigation of petty offences by the police. On the other hand, offences against special and local laws have increased from about 8,000 to 11,000, on account of the more rigorous enforcement of sanitary and\nother regulations in towns. Murders and cognate offences show some increase in recent years, while rape and dacoity have decreased.\n\nThe average number of registration offices open during the decade 1881-90 was 76, and the number of documents registered 24,107, the corresponding figures for 1891-1900 being 88 and 31,947, and for the year 1904 90 and 22,351 respectively. The Deputy-Commissioner is ex-officio District registrar. Each tahsil has a sub-registration office in charge of a special salaried sub-registrar, and where the work is heavy another office exists in the interior of the tahsil. The department is under the control of an Inspector-General, and there are two Registration Inspectors for the Province.\n\nThe main source of government income in the Central Provinces has always been the land revenue, but under Maratha rule numerous petty imposts were added on all branches of trade and industry. These embraced a duty on home produce passing from one part of the country to another, or beyond the frontier, and on foreign merchandise in transit, and numerous other imposts on all articles produced, such as taxes on the stamping of cloths, on tobacco, sugar, cotton, silk, turmeric, and mahua, and on working artisans, as oil-pressers, fishermen, butchers, and tanners; a tax on contracts or licences for the vending of spirituous liquors; a cess on houses, intended to fall particularly on that part of the population not engaged in agriculture; and numerous petty taxes of different kinds, among which may be mentioned a tax on the remarriage of widows, one-fourth of the sale-proceeds of houses, dues on the playing of musical instruments at weddings, and on the use of red powder at the Holi, a fourth of debts recovered by civil action, a tax on gambling, a special tax on the marriages of Baniyas, and others. This multiplicity of small imposts cannot but have been irksome and harassing to the people to the last degree. The greater number of them were abolished on the commencement of British administration, and in the few which were retained can be recognized the germs of our principal sources of revenue outside the land.\n\nThe scheme of Provincial finance was introduced from 1871 to 1872, with the object of enlarging the powers and responsibilities of the Local Governments in respect to expenditure in some civil departments. The method first adopted was to make an annual grant from Imperial revenues to the Provincial Government for the net expenditure in those departments which had been transferred to its control. Gradually the system was introduced of transferring to the Provincial budget the income and expenditure of those departments of administration for which the Provincial Government was mainly responsible; while the contribution from the Province to the Imperial exchequer was paid in the form of a share of the income of the great receiving departments, so\nthat the burden on the Province might increase or diminish according to the fluctuations in its own resources. This object has not, however, been attained in the Central Provinces in recent years, owing to the disorganization caused by famine.\n\nThe average receipts and expenditure of Provincial funds during the quinquennium ending 1887 were 76 and 75.3 lakhs respectively. Provincial receipts represent only the share of the revenue under different heads which is credited to Provincial funds. In this settlement the receipts and charges under Forests, Excise, Assessed Taxes, Stamps, Registration, and the refunds of these revenues were divided equally between the Imperial and Provincial Governments, while those under Provincial Rates, Law and Justice, and Minor departments were made wholly Provincial. The receipts from Land Revenue were nearly equally divided, while the greater part of the expenditure was debited to Provincial funds.\n\nDuring the next period of five years the receipts and expenditure averaged 75.2 and 75 lakhs respectively. For the previous fifteen years the revenue from Excise and Stamps had steadily increased, and this period also witnessed substantial increments in Land Revenue, Forests, and Assessed Taxes.\n\nThe budgeted receipts and expenditure for the quinquennial period from 1892\u20133 were 78.8 lakhs; but owing to the series of failures of crops, the average receipts during its currency were 77.8 lakhs, while the expenditure was 81.9 lakhs. Famine conditions led to the next settlement being made for the year 1897\u20138 only. Provincial funds received half of the receipts from Land Revenue, Assessed Taxes, Forests, and Registration, a fourth of those from Excise and three-fourths from Stamps, the balance in each case going to the Imperial Government, while the receipts and expenditure from the other departments mentioned remained Provincial. The Provincial revenue was estimated at 84.4 lakhs (including a contribution of 3.7 lakhs from Imperial funds), and the expenditure at the same figure. These estimates, however, were not realized owing to famine, and equilibrium was only attained by a further contribution of 20 lakhs from Imperial funds.\n\nIn view of the special circumstances of the Province, and the recurrence of famine, the settlement of 1897\u20138 was extended up to 1905\u20136, when a fresh settlement of a quasi-permanent nature was made for the Central Provinces together with Berar. According to this, Provincial funds obtain half of the receipts from Land Revenue, Stamps, Excise, Assessed Taxes, and Forests, and the whole of those from Registration and Provincial Rates. The whole of the expenditure on Land Revenue and Registration is debited to Provincial funds, and a half of that on Stamps, Excise, Assessed Taxes, and Forests. A fixed annual assignment of 27 lakhs is made to Provincial funds from the Imperial share.\nof Land Revenue. The estimated Provincial income of the Central Provinces and Berar for the year 1906-7 is 189 lakhs, and the estimated expenditure 188 lakhs.\n\nThe total revenue raised in the Central Provinces under heads wholly or partly Provincial in 1903-4 (Table X A, p. 107) amounted to 164.7 lakhs. The main items were, in lakhs of rupees\u2014Land Revenue 83.9, Stamps 14.5, Excise 25.6, Provincial Rates 11.3, Assessed Taxes 3.1, Forests 13.9, Registration 0.9, Law and Justice 1.2, Jails 1.3, Police and Pounds 1.7, and other sources of revenue 7.3 lakhs. Out of the total revenue of 164.7 lakhs, 116.2 lakhs was credited to Provincial funds, including contributions of 36.5 lakhs from Imperial funds.\n\nThe total amount expended in the Province under the several heads of Provincial expenditure in 1903-4 (Table X B, p. 108) was 146.43 lakhs, of which 123.6 lakhs was debited to Provincial funds. The main heads were\u2014Charges in respect of collection of Revenue 32 lakhs, General Administration 7.7, Law and Justice 16.3, Police 16.1, Education 8.9, Medical 5.1, Pensions and Miscellaneous Civil Charges 20.4, and Public Works 30.3 lakhs. Charges in respect of collection include the administration of the Land Revenue, Stamps, Excise, Assessed Taxes, Forests, and Registration departments. During the four years ending March, 1904, 9.27 lakhs from Imperial revenues have been expended on 'major' and 3.74 lakhs from Provincial revenues on 'minor' irrigation works. Ecclesiastical charges (Rs. 64,000) and territorial and political pensions to representatives of former ruling families and others (2.27 lakhs) are solely Imperial heads of expenditure. All heads of expenditure have increased in the last few years, the pay of the Commission having been raised while its numbers have increased, and large additions having been made to the strength of the Provincial and Subordinate services. Famine relief is ordinarily a charge on Provincial funds; but in view of the large outlay and depletion of the Provincial balance, the whole cost of famine since 1894 (except during the years 1894-5 and 1898-9) has been met from Imperial revenues. The direct expenditure on famine between 1894 and 1904 amounted to 6.13 crores, while additions on account of loss of revenue, indirect charges, and irrecoverable advances make up the total cost of famine during this period to 8.76 crores. Provincial expenditure on the prevention of plague amounted to 5.34 lakhs from 1898 to 1904.\n\nThe commencement of British rule found most villages of the open country in the hands of lessees (p\u0101\u1e6dels or thek\u0101d\u0101rs), who held farms of the village land revenue from government, generally for short periods, the leases being given for single\n\n---\n\n1 The figures in this paragraph differ from those contained in Table X II, as they show the whole expenditure of the departments and not only the expenditure debited to Provincial funds.\nvillages. Villages so managed were collectively known as the *kh\u0101ls\u0101*. The hills and forests surrounding the plains were parcelled out into estates held by hereditary chieftains, called *zam\u012bnd\u0101rs* or *j\u0101gird\u0101rs*. These generally held on a feudal or service tenure, paying a nominal revenue, but being responsible for the maintenance of order and for the protection of the lowlands. A third class of villages was held free of revenue by persons or religious foundations to whom they had been assigned.\n\nAt the long-term settlements made immediately after the constitution of the Province in 1861, it was decided to recognize as full proprietors all persons in possession of villages, whether as lessees, *zam\u012bnd\u0101rs*, or revenue-free grantees. The reasons which prompted this declaration of policy are not set forth in the documents containing it. But they appear to have been based on the same belief that led to the Permanent Settlement of Bengal, that is to say, that the development of the country could best be assured by a class of landlords possessing as nearly as possible a fee simple in their estates. Fifteen of the *zam\u012bnd\u0101ris* were considered to be of sufficient importance to warrant their being constituted Feudatory States. The estates in the northern Districts which had come under British rule thirty-six years earlier than the rest of the Province had at the time of the settlements in 1863 already lost most of their distinctive features, and were simply settled with the landlord, village by village, as an ordinary proprietor. The estates in Bhand\u0101ra and B\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t Districts, many though not all of which were of recent origin, were settled at a favourable revenue assessed on the whole estate as a unit; but their owners received no patent, and hold as ordinary proprietors, their estates being partible and alienable. The holders of the other *j\u0101girs* and *zam\u012bnd\u0101ris* in Hoshang\u0101b\u0101d and Chhindw\u0101ra, Ch\u0101nda, and the Chhatt\u012bsgarh Districts were similarly assessed to a single payment at a favourable proportion of the 'assets,' and either then or subsequently received patents declaring their estates inalienable, heritable by the rule of primogeniture, and not liable to partition, though the legal effect of these restrictions is not quite free from doubt. In the villages of the *kh\u0101ls\u0101* the effect of the grant of proprietary rights to the headmen was much wider than in the *zam\u012bnd\u0101ris*, and converted a leasehold into practically a freehold tenure, the proprietors of villages so created being called *m\u0101lgus\u0101rs*. The grant of transferable rights and the resulting increase in their credit has, however, not been an unmixed boon to the village proprietors. Not much accustomed to forethought or capable in business, many of them borrowed up to the limit of their means, only to find when a series of bad harvests supervened that they could not pay their debts, and must relinquish their estates to the money-lender. The expropriation of the hereditary village proprietors has engaged the anxious attention of Government; and\nunder the new Tenancy Act of 1898, it is provided that no landowner can alienate his village without retaining a cultivating occupancy right in his home-farm land, unless the transfer without reservation has been previously sanctioned by Government. In many of the zamindari and other large estates the tenure of inferior proprietor was conferred on farmers of villages of long standing, in order to protect them against ejectment. Subsequently to the grant of proprietary right a new tenure has been devised with the same object, that of protected status 'thekadar or farmer.'\n\nThe m\u0101lgus\u0101ri tenure is subject to partition according to Hindu law; and the most recent statistics show that the ownership of 27,575 villages is shared between 94,575 persons, giving an average of 3.4 shares for each village.\n\nThe class of revenue-free grantees hold on different conditions, some grants having been made wholly free of revenue and others on a quit-rent, both classes being in some cases granted in perpetuity, in others for a term, as, for example, a number of lives. Such grants are resumed on expiry of the term of the grant, alienation of the property by the grantee, or breach of the conditions on which the grant was made. The amount of land held on revenue-free or quit-rent tenure in 1903-4 was 2,662 square miles, and the amount of revenue alienated 4.28 lakhs.\n\nOf the whole area of the Province, 31,188 square miles are included in the Feudatory States, 16,796 square miles in the zamindari area held under custom of primogeniture, and 48,906 square miles in the m\u0101lgus\u0101ri area held under ordinary Hindu law. The remaining area, amounting to 16,391 square miles, represents the forest estate held by the Government as direct proprietor. This tract consists of the waste and forest area reserved after the allotment to villages of sufficient land for their requirements, the proportion thus given being usually twice the cultivated area. For a time a certain quantity of Government waste land was sold outright, free of land revenue though not of cesses, the amount of land thus permanently alienated being 213 square miles. In recent years, the policy has been adopted of setting apart any excess of waste land not required as 'reserved' forest for colonization on the ryotwari system. The total area held on ryotwari tenure in 1903-4 was 2,571 square miles; but of this only 459,268 acres or 718 square miles were actually occupied for cultivation and assessed to revenue.\n\nOf the village lands held in m\u0101lgus\u0101ri or ordinary proprietary right, the village waste or forest, subject to certain easements of the tenants, belongs to the proprietors, who also own demesne lands amounting to 19 per cent. of the whole area occupied for cultivation. The remaining area is held by different classes of subordinate proprietors or tenants.\n\n1 The figures in this paragraph have been adjusted on account of the transfers to Bengal.\nwith varying rights. The first class is that known as m\u0101lik-makb\u016bsa or 'plot-proprietor,' who pays revenue to Government through the proprietor of the village and has complete transferable and heritable right. Only 4 per cent. of the occupied area in the kh\u0101lsa is held by this tenure. Next to the m\u0101lik-makb\u016bsa the 'absolute-occupancy' tenure is the most privileged. This is heritable and transferable, subject to pre-emption on the part of the landlord, and includes fixity of rent for the term of settlement. Both m\u0101lik-makb\u016bsa and 'absolute-occupancy' rights were conferred at the same time as those of proprietors, and are not capable of being acquired. 'Absolute-occupancy' tenants hold 12 per cent. of the whole area. The status which is now considered to confer the necessary measure of protection, and which can be acquired at any time, is that of an 'occupancy tenant.' The rent of an 'occupancy tenant' is fixed at settlement, and is liable to enhancement by a Revenue officer at intervals of not less than ten years, on proof that it is inadequate. His tenure is heritable by direct succession, or by collaterals resident in the village, but under the recent amendment to the law is not transferable except to an heir or a co-sharer, or by a sub-lease for one year. Occupancy rights could formerly be alienated with the landlord's consent, and the change has been made with a view to the protection of this class of tenants from expropriation for debt. These rights were till recently acquired by twelve years' continuous possession of the land; but this rule has been abrogated, and they are now obtained only by a payment to the proprietor of a premium of two and a half years' rental. 'Occupancy tenants' hold 30 per cent. of the whole area. The ordinary or non-occupancy tenants have been holding until lately almost at the pleasure of their landlords, and in some tracts have been severely rack-rented. But the recent Tenancy Act (XI of 1898) has conferred on them a very substantial measure of protection. Their rents, like those of the superior classes, are now fixed at settlement and the Settlement officer has power to reduce exorbitant rents. The rent can be enhanced at intervals of seven years after settlement, but the tenant can apply to a Revenue officer to have a fair rent fixed. As in the case of 'occupancy tenants' and for the same reasons, the right of transfer has now been withdrawn from ordinary tenants. The tenure is heritable in direct succession, but not by collaterals unless they are co-sharers in the holding. Ordinary tenants hold 31 per cent. of the occupied area.\n\nThere remains the class of village service tenants, who hold their land rent-free or at a reduced rent on condition of rendering customary service. They possess 1 per cent. of the occupied area.\n\nThe Central Provinces have been constituted so recently, and are made up of tracts differing so widely in their previous history, that no estimate of the land revenue previous to the cession of the Saugor and Nerbudda Territories and the simultaneous commencement of the\nregency in Nagpur can be attempted. At that date, 1817-8, the revenue of the Saugor and Nerbudda Territories was 28\u00bd lakhs, that of Nagpur 21 lakhs, and that of Chhattisgarh 3-6 lakhs. If to this we add the earliest available figures for Nimar (Rs. 93,000) and Sambalpur (1-1 lakhs), a total of 55-1 lakhs is arrived at.\n\nPrevious to their cession the Saugor and Nerbudda Territories had been harassed by constant war and ground down by exceedingly heavy taxation. A system of short leases ruled, and villages were given to the highest bidders. The headmen had to content themselves with a tenth of the profits, and the hereditary families were displaced by outside speculators. Short-term settlements were made at the commencement of British rule; and in the belief that the benefits conferred by a settled government should enable the people to pay more, an abortive attempt was made to maintain and even enhance the revenue handed over to us by the Bhonsla government. Twenty years after the cession the revenue had fallen from 28\u00bd to 24 lakhs; and in 1836-7, the necessity for substantial abatements having been fully recognized, a twenty years' settlement was made in which the demand was fixed at 22\u00bd lakhs. On its expiration, and after the dislocation caused by the Mutiny, these Districts in common with the rest of the Province were settled for thirty years.\n\nNagpur was under British administration from 1818 to 1830, when it was restored to native rule till 1854. Under the Marathas the assessment was made annually, and the amount was fixed in the first place in the aggregate for the pargana or small subdivision, and then distributed among the villages by the pargana officer in consultation with the headmen. Between 1818 and 1830, triennial settlements were substituted for annual settlements, and the administration was considerably improved. When the Districts were handed back, the revenue had been raised from 21 to 26\u00bd lakhs. The subsequent period of Maratha administration was extremely lax, numerous assignments were made, and much of the revenue was appropriated by the officials. At the cession in 1854 the demand had fallen to 23 lakhs. Summary revisions were made after the cession, and replaced by a long-term settlement in 1860.\n\nThe Chhattisgarh Districts had enjoyed for many centuries a peaceful and patriarchal government under the Haihaiansi Rajput dynasty, until this was subverted by the Marathas in the eighteenth century. The Haihaians were content to accept service in lieu of a portion of their revenue, and do not appear to have felt a want of money which would induce them to rack-rent their subjects. To this must be added the\n\n1 The Jubbulpore and Nerbudda Divisions, excluding Chhindwara and Nimar.\n2 The Nagpur Division and Chhindwara.\n3 Raipur, Bilaspur, and Drug.\nfact that the country, owing to its isolation, was untouched by foreign invaders, while at the same time the absence of any means of transport made grain unsaleable in years of plenty. The result was that the country paid an extraordinarily low revenue, and has continued to do so up to the present time. Between 1818 and 1830 this territory was admirably administered by Colonel Agnew, who, while retaining the annual settlements previously in force, effected such improvements in the system of collection as to raise the revenue from 3\u00b76 to 3\u00b79 lakhs, while removing all its oppressive features. After its restoration to native rule the country fared pretty well, and would have greatly improved had it not been for scarcities in 1835 and 1845, which ruined a large number of villages. In spite of this, however, the revenue continued to increase, and at the escheat in 1854 had risen to over 4 lakhs. From 1854 to 1862 triennial settlements were made, and the revenue was raised to 4\u00b76 lakhs.\n\nIn 1863 and the following years long-term settlements were carried out throughout the whole Province, being made for thirty years in thirteen Districts, for twenty years in four, and for twelve years in Sambalpur. This settlement marks a great epoch in the history of land revenue administration, as it witnessed the creation of the system of proprietary and cultivating tenures described above, and was accompanied by the first cadastral survey of the village lands. The average proportion of the proprietors' income or 'assets' taken as revenue in all Districts was 62 per cent. The total enhancement of revenue was only 7 lakhs or from 53 to 60 lakhs, and in several Districts the demand was reduced. The procedure of the settlements contemplated such an adjustment and enhancement of the rental of the tenants as would be in agreement with the new revenue. But in practice the rental was substantially enhanced only in eight Districts, while in nine the increase was under 10 per cent.\n\nDuring the currency of the thirty years' settlement the Province enjoyed a period of almost unbroken agricultural prosperity. Shortly after its commencement the railway was opened from Bombay to Nagpur and Jubbulpore, producing an immediate large increase in the demand for produce and a rise in its value. When the course of prices was examined at the recent revision, it was found that in ten Districts the price of the staple grains had doubled, thus producing a decrease of 50 per cent. in the real burden of the revenue. Between the thirty years' settlement and 1893-4 the cropped area increased by 29 per cent., while the rental of the tenants had been raised in sixteen Districts by 29 lakhs by the proprietors themselves. The benefits of this great increase of wealth had been enjoyed for a long period of years by the tenants and proprietors, the Government obtaining no fraction of the proportion to which it was legitimately entitled.\nThe new settlements began in 1885 with Sambalpur. They were preceded by an accurate cadastral survey, and a detailed record of tenures, rent, and character of cultivation for every field in the village. In addition, a list was drawn up showing for every field the quality of its soil, and its position, whether favourable or unfavourable for cultivation. In every District a number of soils of different quality and varying productiveness, often amounting to ten, twelve, or even more, were distinguished, most of these being known to the people and designated by their vernacular names. Besides this, the position of each field was taken into account as far as this affected its productive capacity. In order to arrive at a correct valuation of land, a system was devised by which each different soil was represented by a proportionate numerical factor of value, and the factor was increased or diminished in a fixed ratio for each different position in which a field might lie. This numerical factor was considered to be the equivalent of the same number of 'soil-units,' and the system is called the 'soil-unit' system. The proportion by which the rental generally could be enhanced on the score of rise in prices and increased cultivation was first determined; the average rent now paid by one 'soil-unit' was obtained by dividing the total number of 'soil-units' contained by all fields in the village into the rental of the village; the rent which one 'soil-unit' would pay according to the percentage of enhancement was calculated, the result being known as the 'unit-rate'; and the rent for each field or holding was then deduced by multiplying this figure by the number of 'soil-units' contained in the field or holding. The process is, however, in practice not merely mechanical, nearly every village being inspected by the Settlement officer, while different rates of enhancement are taken for different groups of villages, and then again varied for individual villages. When the deduced rent, or that which each holding should be called on to pay according to its capacity, has been calculated, the existing rent is compared with it, and if the enhancement would be too large a lower one is fixed. The rents of all tenants were fixed in this manner; and the rental value of the home farm of the proprietor or m\u0101gus\u0101r was similarly calculated by the 'soil-unit' system, as a rule, according to the 'unit-rate' fixed for the village. Any income which the proprietor might enjoy from forest grass or fruit trees on the village waste, or other extraneous sources, was further included at a low valuation and with a large margin for fluctuations. The total of rents, rental value of home farm, and miscellaneous or s\u012bvai income, constitutes the proprietor's income or 'assets' of the village. The Settlement officer then proceeded to determine the share of the 'assets' which was to be taken as revenue.\n\nThe average increase in the rent roll over that at the previous settlement was 55 per cent., the highest rate of increase being 107 per cent.\nin Bil\u0101spur, where there had been a large extension of cultivation. The actual increase of rents at revision was usually much less than this, as all enhancements made by the proprietors themselves during the currency of settlement have to be deducted from it. The actual increase in rents at settlement varied from 1 per cent. in Mandl\u0101 to 39 per cent. in Sambalpur, the average being 14 per cent. The pressure of the revised rental on the tenants has recently been examined, and it is estimated that the rental value of the m\u0101lguz\u0101r\u012b area of the Province amounts to about 162 lakhs. The value of the annual crop out-turn is taken at a moderate computation to be about 17 crores. The rental absorbs therefore less than a tenth of the produce. The fraction of the proprietor's income or 'assets' taken as revenue was generally smaller than at the thirty years' settlements, the average for sixteen Districts being 56 per cent. as against 62 per cent. in 1863. The land revenue of the Province was raised from 60 to 89 lakhs, the largest enhancement being 80 per cent. in Bil\u0101spur. The recent series of partial and total failures of the harvest has, however, in many Districts caused a serious decrease in the extent and value of the crops grown, while the agricultural classes have become impoverished and indebted. Government has been quick to recognize the altered state of things; and in addition to large remissions of the current demand in seasons of failure, regular abatements of revenue for a period of years have been made in all the affected Districts. In 1903-4 the land revenue had been reduced to 86 lakhs\\(^1\\), falling at 9 annas 3 pies per acre on the cultivated area. Action is also under consideration for increasing the elasticity of the land revenue collections, and for providing for rapid and liberal suspensions of the demand in cases of local failure of the harvest.\n\nThe period now adopted for land revenue settlements is twenty years, as being most suitable for the Province in its still developing condition; but in order to cause the new settlements to expire in rotation and not simultaneously, they have been made for terms ranging from twelve to twenty-three years in different Districts.\n\nIn the zamind\u0101r\u012b estates the revenue is fixed at a favourably low rate, as a rule not exceeding 40 per cent. of the 'assets.' In ryotw\u0101r\u012b villages the whole of the ryot's payment is taken as the Government revenue, subject to a small drawback allowed to the managing headman (p\u0101tel) for the trouble of collection. In regularly settled ryotw\u0101r\u012b villages the revenue is assessed on holdings or 'survey-numbers,' and in others according to the area cropped, which is measured annually. Concessions are granted to headmen who agree to found new villages by the remission of the revenue for three years, and in the case of\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The demand for land revenue in the Province, after the changes of area effected in 1905, was 84 lakhs, and the demand for cesses 10 lakhs.\nrice villages, in which a tank is constructed, for a longer period which may extend to twenty years.\n\nUp till 1872 the cultivation of poppy under licence was permitted all over the Province, but it was completely prohibited in 1879. Opium is now obtained from the factory at Ghazipur, and supplied to District treasuries, whence it is issued to licensed vendors at Rs. 22 a seer. Of this, Rs. 8\u20138 is credited to the opium revenue as the cost of production, and the remaining Rs. 13\u20138 represents the excise duty. Shops for the retail vend of opium are sanctioned in special localities, and the contracts for sale are disposed of annually by auction. In 1903\u20134 there were 952 permanent and 338 temporary shops in British territory. Besides the licensed vendors the District treasuries also supply the Feudatory States, who have agreed to obtain all the opium required in their territories in this way. The drug is issued to them at different rates, which are fixed by agreement and are usually lower than the rate charged to licensed vendors in British Districts.\n\nThe consumption of opium in 1903\u20134 amounted to 768 maunds, and the excise revenue was 6-10 lakhs, of which 2 lakhs was derived from licence fees, 3 lakhs from duty on opium sold to licensed vendors, and the remainder from sales to Feudatory chiefs. During the decades ending 1890 and 1900 the corresponding figures were 7 and 6-6 lakhs, respectively. The consumption of the drug decreased in the last decade owing to the impoverishment of the people caused by the famines, and the effects of this still remain. A large amount of smuggling is carried on from the Native States adjoining the Vindhyan and Narbad\u0101 valley Districts, and special measures for the repression of this have recently been taken.\n\nUp to 1874 the salt tax was mainly levied by the imposition of duty at a customs line, which in the form of a giant hedge of thorns barred the Provinces from the salt-producing regions of R\u0101jput\u0101na on the north, and Bombay and Madras on the west and south. No salt is produced in the Province, and no revenue is therefore now raised directly within it. The consumption has increased from 43,000 to 53,000 tons during the decades ending 1890 and 1900 respectively to 60,000 tons in 1904; the consumption per head of population was 8 lb. in 1881, 10 lb. in 1891, 13 lb. in 1901, and 13-2 lb. in 1904. The revenue payable on the salt consumed in the Province was 25-5 lakhs in 1881 and 32 lakhs in 1904, though the duty was 8 annas per maund lower in the latter year. The incidence of duty per head of population was 3 annas 9 pies in 1881, and 4 annas 4 pies in 1904.\n\nEver since the constitution of the Province in 1861, the problem of regulating the system of taxation and vend of intoxicating liquors to satisfy the varying requirements of different parts of the country has\npressed for solution, while an exhaustive inquiry on the subject has recently been conducted with a view to placing the excise administration on a more satisfactory basis. Prior to the changes introduced on the recommendation of the Excise Committee (1904) three systems were in force, designated respectively the modified bonded warehouse, the central or sadr distillery, and the out-still systems. The liquor is almost invariably distilled from the flower of the mahua-tree (Bassia latifolia). The modified bonded warehouse system was in force in Nagpur and the greater part of Nimar. Under this, liquor was manufactured at a central distillery under Government supervision and of a prescribed strength. It was removed to Government bonded warehouses and issued to retail vendors at a fixed rate, varying from Rs. 1-14 to Rs. 4 a gallon according to the strength of the liquor. The manufacturing contractor tendered for the rate at which he would supply the liquor, and the difference between this and the price charged to retail vendors was the Government duty. The contract rates of manufacture varied between 9 annas and R. 1 for liquors of different strength. The retail vendors obtained their licences by auction and paid licence fees. The sadr distillery system was in force at most District head-quarters, and in some other towns in open parts of the country. Under it a central distillery was maintained for the supply of a radius of 10 or 12 miles round the town, and liquor was distilled and removed to outlying shops for sale. The distillation was carried on under Government supervision, and duty was charged at the rate of from 1 to 4 annas per seer on the quantity of mahua used, the contractor being free after payment of this duty to manufacture and retail the liquor at his discretion. The same contractor usually held the rights of manufacture and of retail vend. The report of the Excise Committee (1904) showed that the system had many defects, the checks to the smuggling of untaxed mahua being quite inadequate, while the machinery for distillation was inefficient and the quality of the liquor produced inferior. There were 26 sadr distilleries in the Province in 1903-4, and the area supplied by them was approximately 11,449 square miles. Over the rest of the Province the out-still system was in force, under which the right of distillation for a small circle of villages was disposed of by auction, and the contractor made and sold the liquor at his discretion. In 1903-4 there were 1,929 out-stills in British Districts, the number having been reduced from 2,250 since 1889-90. The total number of places of retail vend was 6,811, or one to every 9\u00be square miles. About 60 per cent. of the revenue on country liquor was raised from central distilleries and 40 per cent. from out-stills. No control is exercised by Government over the sale of liquor in the Feudatory States. The liquor made by simple fermentation from the sap of palm-trees, called jari, is subject to taxation.\nIt is consumed to a small extent in N\u0101gpur, Wardh\u0101, Ch\u0101nda, and Nim\u0101r Districts, and the right to manufacture and retail it is sold annually by auction, the licence fees amounting to Rs. 24,500 in 1903-4. The only imported spirit of which statistics are kept is Indian rum manufactured at Sh\u0101hjah\u0101npur. The imports of this spirit during the decade 1891-1900 averaged 6,015 gallons, and had increased to 11,188 gallons in 1903-4. Its sale is practically confined to the large towns, where it is preferred by educated natives and Eurasians to the impure mahu\u0101 spirit. A brewery was started at Jubbulpore in 1896. The receipts from foreign liquors in 1903-4 were nearly Rs. 17,000, derived almost entirely from the beer duty and fees on licences. The average receipts during the decades 1881-90 and 1891-1900 were Rs. 5,700 and Rs. 22,400 respectively.\n\nThe hemp plant is cultivated under licence for the production of g\u0101nja in Nim\u0101r District, which furnishes the supply for the Central Provinces and Ber\u0101r, the area cultivated in 1903-4 being 150 acres. Wholesale vendors are appointed by tender for each District or tahsil, who purchase the drug from the storehouse and are bound to sell it to retail vendors at a fixed price of Rs. 5 per seer, the Government price being Rs. 4, and the proportion of the remaining rupee which the contractor is to pay to Government being settled by tender. The Government price was raised to Rs. 5 per seer in 1906 and a new system was introduced, licences for wholesale vend being granted to suitable applicants without restriction, and the rate at which the drug is obtained by retail vendors being left to be settled by competition. For retail vend, shops are opened at suitable places, and disposed of separately by auction, the number of permanent shops for retail vend of g\u0101nja in 1903-4 being 1,004. Bhang is charged with a Government duty of Rs. 2 per seer. The consumption of g\u0101nja and bhang in the British Districts of the Central Provinces in 1903-4 was 812 maunds (g\u0101nja 750 maunds, and bhang 62 maunds); and the revenue realized amounted to 2\u00b716 lakhs, of which 1\u00b720 lakhs was obtained from duty, and Rs. 96,000 from licence fees. The average receipts during the decades ending 1890 and 1900 were 1\u00b76 and 2\u00b73 lakhs respectively. G\u0101nja is supplied to the Feudatory States either free or at a reduced rate, on condition that the price charged to retail vendors is the same as in British territory.\n\nThe gross excise revenue, excluding opium, in 1903-4 was 19\u00b750 lakhs, of which 16\u00b755 lakhs was obtained from country liquor, while the charges for collection amounted to only Rs 65,000, giving a net revenue of 18\u00b785 lakhs. The average gross receipts during the decades ending 1890 and 1900 were 16\u00b73 and 17\u00b76 lakhs respectively, the corresponding figures for country liquor, which is the chief item of the revenue, being 14\u00b72 and 14\u00b77 lakhs. The incidence of revenue per\nhead of population has varied between 3 annas 6 pies and 3 annas 1 pie during the last two decades. The local administration of the excise revenue has hitherto been conducted by the Deputy-Commissioners of Districts, with one or two subordinate officials, under the supervision of an Excise Commissioner for the Central Provinces and Berar. In 1905 sanction was given for the employment of a greatly increased and specialized establishment. Native opinion on the supply of intoxicating liquors is neutral, and there is no feeling in favour of prohibition or local option. The effect of English education is in some cases to lead members of the higher castes to disregard their caste rules on prohibition, and to take to drinking alcoholic liquor; but this class usually prefers imported spirits.\n\nThe report of the Excise Committee, issued at the end of 1904, recommended an entire change in the present administration. The basis of the scheme proposed is a system of large contracts with competent distillers, who will use their own premises for the supply of a prescribed area at a fixed price for manufacture. Liquor of high strength will be distilled and conveyed to bonded warehouses, the cost of carriage being distributed over all issues by fixing a price to cover it, and the contracts for manufacture and vend will be completely separated. Still-head duty is to be levied at three different rates, Rs. 3\u20132, Rs. 1\u201314, and R. 0\u201315 per proof gallon, to allow for the varying conditions of development of different parts of the country. The duty and cost of manufacture will be paid by the retail vendors on removal of the liquor from the bonded warehouses. The new scheme must be introduced gradually, in order to obtain experience in working it, but may ultimately be extended to the whole Province, with the exception of a few of the more densely-wooded tracts on the Satpur\u00e1s and the southern and eastern zamindaris, for which out-stills would be retained. The proposals of the Committee were given effect to in five Districts in 1905\u20136.\n\nThe following figures show the average net revenue from sales of judicial and non-judicial stamps during the decades ending 1890 and 1900, and the net revenue in the year 1903\u20134, in thousands of rupees:\n\n|                | 1881\u201390 | 1891\u20131900 | 1903\u20134 |\n|----------------|---------|-----------|--------|\n| Judicial stamps | 9.46    | 11.33     | 9.92   |\n| Non-judicial stamps | 4.05    | 4.66      | 4.17   |\n\nThe demand for each class of stamps continued to increase steadily up to 1893\u20134, when the combined revenue was 17.2 lakhs, or 12.2 for judicial and 5 lakhs for non-judicial stamps. The revenue then began to decline owing to the bad seasons, which seem to have affected the sales of both classes of stamps to an equal degree. The lowest\ncombined figure was 12.7 lakhs in 1900-1, to which judicial stamps contributed 9 lakhs and non-judicial 3.7.\n\nPrevious to the introduction of the Income Tax Act in 1886, non-agricultural incomes had been taxed under the P\u0101ndhri Act. The receipts from the income-tax during the years 1886-90 averaged 4 lakhs, and during the decade ending 1900 6.5 lakhs. The receipts have gradually declined since 1893-4 owing to losses on account of bad harvests, and amounted in 1903-4 to 2.9 lakhs, the incidence per head of population being 6 pies, and the number of assesses 1.6 per 1,000. The P\u0101ndhri tax, which yielded only Rs. 70,000, was abolished in 1902.\n\nMunicipal administration was first introduced under the Punjab Municipal Acts of 1864 and 1867, which were made applicable to the Central Provinces. The municipality of N\u0101gpur dates from 1864, and in 1867 forty-three towns received a municipal constitution. A special Act was passed for the Central Provinces in 1873, and revised Acts were enacted in 1889 and 1903. The principal points in which the earlier form of municipal self-government differed from that prevailing at present were that the executive officers of Government were usually ex-officio members and presiding officers of municipal committees, that the municipalities maintained their own police force, and that they did not manage their own schools, pounds, dispensaries, and some other local institutions. In 1888 the number of municipal towns was fifty-seven; but between that year and 1901 several of the smaller municipalities were abolished, reducing the number in 1903-4 to forty-six, while similar action in respect to other towns is in contemplation. One municipal town, N\u0101gpur, has a population of over 100,000, nineteen of between 10,000 and 100,000, and twenty-six below 10,000. The total population resident within municipal limits in 1903-4 was 681,851. The total number of members of municipal committees in the same year was 576, of whom 178 were nominated by Government and 398 elected; 125 of the members were officials and the remainder non-officials; 62 were Europeans. Not less than two-fifths of the members of a committee must be persons other than the salaried officers of Government.\n\nThe aggregate income of municipalities in 1903-4 was 19.2 lakhs. In three towns\u2014N\u0101gpur, Jubbulpore, and Khandw\u0101\u2014the receipts exceeded a lakh, and in nineteen towns they were below Rs. 10,000. The incidence of municipal taxation per head was Rs. 1-9-5, and of income Rs. 2-8-0. The main head of receipt is octroi, from which 9.7 lakhs was obtained in twenty-five municipalities in 1903-4, less 3.11 lakhs refunded on goods in transit. Water rate, conservancy cess, and taxes on houses and lands, on animals and vehicles, tolls and market dues are the chief sources of income. The aggregate expenditure in 1903-4 was 17.6 lakhs, of which 4.88 lakhs was spent on administration and\nLOCAL AND MUNICIPAL\n\ncollection, 2\u00b731 lakhs on water-supply (including Rs. 29,000 on drainage), 2\u00b764 lakhs on conservancy, Rs. 73,000 on hospitals and dispensaries, 1\u00b734 lakhs on roads and buildings, and 1\u00b757 lakhs on public instruction.\n\nWater-works have been constructed in ten towns\u00b9, and surface drainage schemes are in process of completion in N\u0101gpur and Jubbulpore, and exist in a few other towns. There is no pipe-drainage, and night-soil and sweepings are always removed in carts. Little or no provision has as yet been made for protection from fire. Municipalities are as a rule not indebted, but a few loans have been taken from Government for water-works. The total amount of loans now outstanding is 9\u00b777 lakhs. Viewed generally, municipal self-government may be considered to have successfully taken root in the Central Provinces; and though the majority of the people as yet care little for it, much useful work is done gratuitously by a small number of non-official gentlemen, principally pleaders and also bankers and landowners.\n\nComplete authority for the disposal of Local funds was vested in the Chief Commissioner in 1863. Their management was at first entrusted to a local committee for each District, consisting of the Commissioner, Deputy-Commissioner, and other nominated members. This arrangement lasted until the passing of the Local Self-Government Act, I of 1883, which provided for the creation of local administrative bodies. The basis of the scheme is a local board for each tahsil and a District council for the whole District area. The constitution of the local boards is as follows. A certain proportion of members are village headmen, each of whom is elected by the headmen or mukaddams of a circle of villages as their representative. Another proportion are representatives of the mercantile and trading classes, and are elected by members of those classes. A third proportion, not exceeding one-third of the whole, consists of members nominated by Government. The constitution of District councils is similar to that of local boards. Each local body has a chairman and secretary, elected by the members subject to the approval of Government. The officers of the District councils are frequently non-officials, but it is generally found convenient that the tahsildar and naid-tahsildar should be chairman and secretary of the local boards. In 1903\u20134 there were seventeen District councils, or one for each District except Mandla, which is excluded from the Act. The total number of members was 328, of whom 84 were nominated, 58 representatives of the mercantile classes, and 186 elected by local boards. The number of local boards was 55, each tahsil usually having one board, while in some cases a separate board is constituted for the large zamindari estates. These boards had 891 members, of whom 214 were nominated, 148 elected by the mercantile classes, and 529 representative village headmen.\n\n\u00b9 R\u0101j-N\u0101ndgaon, a municipal town in the Feudatory States, also has water-works.\nThe District councils have no powers of taxation, and their income is derived from the following sources: the net proceeds of the road and school rates, the former fixed at 3 and the latter at 2 per cent. on the land revenue; the surplus derived from fines in cattle-pounds; the proceeds of public ferries; rents and profits from Government land outside municipal limits; and contributions from Provincial revenues. Their duties consist in the allotment and supervision of expenditure on the objects for the maintenance of which their income is raised. Formerly the upkeep of all roads other than the main Provincial routes was entrusted to the District council. But it soon became clear that an unprofessional committee could not discharge these duties satisfactorily, and the management of all except village tracks has now been transferred to the Public Works department. Arboricultural operations have also been generally made over to the Public Works department. Contracts for the collection of tolls at ferries are sold annually by auction. The maintenance of rural schools, the provision of buildings and apparatus, and the appointment of masters rest with the District council, subject to the supervision and advice of the Deputy-Commissioner and Inspector of Schools. Pounds are under the control of the District council, and are managed by either the police, schoolmasters, or clerks appointed for the purpose. Contributions for expenditure on dispensaries, vaccination, and village sanitation are made to the dispensary fund, and veterinary dispensaries are maintained and managed by the District council, which also makes provision for village sanitation. Expenditure on famine relief is in the first instance a charge on District council funds, and 1.24 lakhs was spent for this purpose between 1895 and 1902. But if distress becomes at all severe the amount available from District funds is entirely inadequate, and the burden must be transferred to Provincial funds. The local boards have no independent income, but submit to the District council a statement of their requirements and an estimate of their probable expenditure, and the District council makes allotments of funds to each local board. Their principal duties are the supervision of expenditure on schools, wells, and village roads.\n\nThe total receipts of District funds in 1903-4 were 11.7 lakhs, of which 4.38 lakhs was realized from Provincial rates\u2014that is, the road, school, and postal cesses\u20141.51 lakhs from pounds, and Rs. 35,000 from ferries, while contributions from Provincial revenues amounted to 2.9 lakhs. Their total expenditure was 11.74 lakhs, of which Rs. 43,000 was spent on general administration, 4.12 lakhs on education, 1.09 lakhs on medical relief, Rs. 20,000 on scientific and other minor objects, and 3.17 lakhs on civil works including contributions to the Public Works department. Nearly two lakhs on each side of the account are nominal income and expenditure.\nThe Public Works department in the Province is controlled by a Chief Engineer for the Central Provinces and Berar, who is also secretary to the Chief Commissioner. There are two Superintending Engineers for roads and buildings: one in charge of the Second Circle, comprising the Jubbulpore and Nerbudda Divisions, and the other of the First Circle, which includes Berar and the Nagpur and Chattisgarh Divisions. A third Superintending Engineer is in charge of irrigation in the Province as a whole. For roads and buildings the Province is divided into eight divisions in charge of Executive Engineers, seven comprising the eighteen Districts of British territory, and one, called the Chattisgarh States division, including the Feudatory States and large samindari estates of the Chattisgarh Districts, in which the expenditure on public works is provided by the estates concerned. For irrigation three separate divisions have been constituted. The Warora colliery was under the Provincial Public Works department and had a separate manager until 1906, when it was closed. There are no State railways in the Province, and no railway branch of the Public Works department. The superior Provincial establishment now comprises 48 Engineers, of whom 11 are temporary.\n\nBuildings belonging to the Postal and Telegraph departments are Imperial, but are maintained by the Provincial Public Works department out of Imperial funds. Military buildings are in some stations under the Public Works and in others under the Military Works department. The other Government buildings in the Province are either Provincial or local. The local roads and buildings consist of surface roads and unimportant buildings, such as rural and municipal school-houses, which are under the charge of municipalities and District councils. All other buildings and roads are Provincial, and their construction and maintenance devolve on the department. The annual expenditure during the decades ending 1890 and 1900 averaged 18 and 16 lakhs respectively. In the last few years the expenditure has largely increased, the figure for 1901-2 being 20 lakhs, and that for 1903-4 28 lakhs. These figures exclude famine expenditure from 1896 to 1903, which amounted to a total of 321 lakhs. The most important buildings that have been constructed recently are the three Central jails, the District office at Jubbulpore, the reformatory school, Jubbulpore, the new Public Offices, the Mayo Hospital, and Government House, at Nagpur. The Victoria Technical Institute now under construction is estimated to cost 15 lakhs, while new Secretariat buildings are about to be undertaken at a cost of 4\u00bd lakhs.\n\nEleven towns in the Province are now supplied with water-works, all of which have been opened since 1890, at a total cost of 25 lakhs. No regular drainage works are in existence, but projects for surface drainage\nare at present being carried out in Nagpur and Jubbulpore, while small sums have been expended in other towns. A contract for the construction and working of electric tramways in Nagpur by an English firm is under consideration.\n\nIn 1892 a separate division of the Public Works department, under an Executive Engineer, was formed for the construction of roads and buildings in the Feudatory States and large samindari estates of Chhattisgarh. From that year to 1904 a sum of 5.6 lakhs has been expended on the construction of roads and 6.09 lakhs on buildings. The buildings erected consist of public offices, schools, dispensaries, and residences for the families of the chiefs and samindars. The total expenditure of the division during the same period was over 20 lakhs.\n\nThe strength of the British and Native army stationed within the Province on June 1, 1903, was 2,018 British and 2,647 Native troops: total, 4,665. The Province falls within the Mhow division of the Western Command. The military stations in 1903 were Jubbulpore, Kamptee, Saugor, Stabaldi, and Pachmarhi. The Nagpur Volunteer Rifles have their head-quarters at Nagpur. The total number of volunteers within the Province in 1903 was 1,273.\n\nThe police force was constituted in its present form on the formation of the Province, the previously existing Nagpur Irregular Force being disbanded and the most efficient men drafted into the local police. The samindari estates with an area of 19,000 square miles were for a time excluded from the jurisdiction of the force, the samindars being allowed to make their own police arrangements; but the whole of this area is now under regular police administration. In municipal towns a separate police force was maintained by the municipality until 1882. The force has been slightly increased on several occasions, generally in consequence of fresh duties being imposed on it. In 1891 the numbers of the mounted police were reduced, and an increase was made in the remuneration of inspectors, head constables, and constables. The pay of inspectors ranges from Rs. 100 to Rs. 200, of sub-inspectors from Rs. 50 to Rs. 80, of head constables from Rs. 12 to Rs. 30, and of constables from Rs. 6 to Rs. 8. In 1904 the force consisted of 26 European officers, 48 inspectors, 174 sub-inspectors, 1,226 head constables, and 7,253 constables, besides 111 cantonment police, or a total of 8,843 of all ranks. This strength was equivalent to one man for 9 square miles of area and for 1,095 persons of the population. The total cost was 15.3 lakhs. The superior officers comprise an Inspector-General, whose jurisdiction extends also over Berar, 18 District Superintendents, and 11 Assistant Superintendents. The pay of the police in the cantonments of Kamptee and Saugor is met from\ncantonment funds, but they are under the orders of the District Superintendent. On three railways special railway police are employed, and on others the Provincial force. A special reserve of 200 men is distributed over the head-quarters of six Districts, which is intended to deal with armed disturbers of the peace in whatever quarter they may appear. The men composing this reserve are regularly drilled and armed with rifles. The ordinary reserve and District police have breech-loading smooth-bores or carbines. The mounted police number only 95, and are stationed at the head-quarters of Districts.\n\nEuropean officers of police are now recruited chiefly in England. Native officers are usually appointed by promotion from the lower grades, and nearly all the superior executive officers have risen from the rank of constable. A police training school for the Central Provinces was established in 1905. A large proportion of the native officers are Muhammadans. Constables are enlisted by the District Superintendent, preference being given to literate men and to inhabitants of the locality. A considerable section of the force, however, consists of recruits from Northern India, generally the United Provinces. The majority of constables are high-caste Hindus, but 1,316 belong to low castes, including 121 Gonds, and more than half are illiterate. Constables are required before confirmation to obtain a certificate involving a knowledge of drill and musketry, the definitions of common offences, and elementary rules of police action and their duties on beats. Head constables must pass an examination in the methods prescribed for the handling of crime, the criminal law, and the general duties of the police. The difficulty of obtaining suitable recruits has become acute in some Districts, where the wages of ordinary or factory labour compare favourably with those of police constables. The service is generally considered not sufficiently attractive to obtain a good class of men; and the causes advanced in explanation are the recruitment of native officers from the ranks, the inadequate pay of the lower grades, and the insufficient number of more highly paid appointments. Measures for a general improvement in the pay and prospects of the police are now being carried out.\n\nIdentification by means of anthropometry was introduced in 1895, and the finger-tip impression system was substituted for it in 1898. A central bureau is maintained at Nagpur for dealing with criminals who range over more than one District or Province, the identification of local criminals being left to the District police. More than 19,600 slips of ex-convicts were on record in 1904, and the system has proved very successful. A reformatory school for juvenile offenders is maintained at Jubbulpore and had 125 inmates in 1904.\n\nThe Central Provinces have no village police as the term is understood in some other parts of India. The village watchman or kotwar\nis the subordinate of the village headman and not a police official, and it is considered very desirable to maintain his position in this respect. The duties of the watchman are to report births and deaths, the commission of offences, and the residence of professional criminals; and to do this he must proceed once a week to the police post to which his village is attached. He must also assist the police in the detection of crime in his village. There is generally a watchman for every inhabited village, and large villages have two or more. Their remuneration is now paid in cash and is about Rs. 3 per month. The watchmen generally belong to the lowest castes, and are illiterate, but perform their duties efficiently.\n\nThe following table gives statistics of cognizable crime:\n\n|                                | Average for five years ending 1901 | 1902 | 1904 |\n|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------|------|------|\n| Number of cases reported       | 34,879                            | 21,532 | 21,725 |\n| Number of cases decided in criminal courts | 10,718                           | 10,439 | 11,139 |\n| Number of cases ending in acquittal or discharge | 2,337                             | 1,675 | 2,361 |\n| Percentage of cases ending in acquittal or discharge to total cases decided | 14                                 | 16    | 21    |\n| Number of cases ending in conviction | 14,381                            | 8,754 | 8,778 |\n| Percentage of cases ending in conviction to number of cases decided | 86                                 | 84    | 79    |\n\nThe Province contains 3 Central and 15 District jails, and 1 subsidiary jail. The Central jails are at Nagpur, Jubbulpore, and Raipur, and also serve as District jails for those Districts. Each of the other Districts has a jail at its head-quarters, and Sironcha, owing to its distance from the District head-quarters at Chanda, has a subsidiary jail. The jails contain accommodation altogether for 4,921 male and 498 female prisoners. During 1904 the average daily number of prisoners in all the Central jails was 2,020, and in the District jails 1,134. Long-term prisoners are transferred from District to Central jails, provided that they are in a fit state of health for hard labour. The health of the convicts is generally good and the death-rate favourable, though it was increased in the years of famine by the admission of many prisoners in a bad state of health. The average cost of maintenance per prisoner in 1904 was Rs. 88. A Central jail is under a Superintendent who is a member of the Indian Medical Service, while a District jail is managed by the Civil Surgeon of the District. Each of the three Central jails has its distinctive industry, directed towards supplying the wants of the consuming departments of Government. Weaving is carried on at Jubbulpore, and mats, towels, pillow-cases, and other articles are manufactured for the Supply and Transport department.\nTo the N\u0101gpur jail is entrusted the printing of the forms required for use by all the Government departments of the Central Provinces, while the Raipur jail produces the annual supplies of clothing required by the Police and Jail departments. At District jails the recognized industries are stone-breaking, oil-pressing, and the manufacture of aloe-fibre. The total expenditure on the Jail department in 1904 was \u20b9279 lakhs, and the receipts from manufactures Rs. 1,25,000.\n\nNeither the Mar\u012bth\u0101 government nor its subjects recognized any duty on the part of the state to educate the people, and the present system of popular education is entirely the outcome of British ideas. The establishment of vernacular schools in the Saugor and Nerbudda Territories was commenced on a substantial scale in 1854. At this time these Territories contained about 270 vernacular schools and 2,500 scholars. In the southern Districts, outside N\u0101gpur, which had several schools, education was practically confined to the Br\u0101hman caste. Itinerant schoolmasters held classes on the main routes for pilgrims, and at the larger temples instruction in Sanskrit was given to Gosains and other religious mendicants. In Chhatt\u012bsgarh there was practically no education at all. The Educational department was constituted in 1862, and the scheme then drawn up has remained the basis of the system of public instruction to the present day. The leading principles laid down were that the department should content itself with the direct management of colleges and higher secondary schools, the training of teachers, and inspection work in rural areas. The maintenance of rural schools should as far as possible be left to the local authorities, every encouragement should be afforded to private enterprise and philanthropy, and no Government schools should be founded where there existed a sufficient number of institutions capable, with assistance from the state, of supplying the local demand for instruction. In 1863, 1,169 schools with 21,353 pupils had been established, and the annual expenditure was about a lakh. By 1881 there were 1,437 schools with 79,551 pupils. In 1884\u20135 the management of rural schools was made over to District councils; and in 1891 the number of institutions had risen to 1,845 with 111,498 pupils, including 3 colleges and 10 high schools. Strenuous efforts have been made recently for the development of primary education. In 1903\u20134 there were 2,494 schools of all classes with 167,178 pupils, this being the best result ever attained.\n\nAt the head of the Educational department is the Director of Public Instruction, who has a staff of four Inspectors for British Districts, and an Inspectress for all girls' schools. The Indian Educational service includes these appointments with the exception of one Inspectorship of Schools, and also those of the principal, Jubbulpore College, and the superintendent of the Training Institution for Teachers, Jubbulpore.\nAn Agency Inspector supervises the schools of the Feudatory States, but this is a private appointment outside the cadre of the Educational department. Each Inspector has a circle of several Districts and inspects each rural school on an average about every third year. Secondary schools are inspected once or twice a year. In each District are one or more Deputy-Inspectors under the orders of the Deputy-Commissioner, though their training and appointment rest with the Educational department. There were twenty-nine Deputy-Inspectors in 1904. The Provincial Educational service includes the appointments of one Inspector of Schools and some professors of the Jubbulpore College, and the Subordinate service those of Deputy-Inspectors and the training staff in Government secondary schools. The greater number of the middle and primary schools are controlled by municipal committees and District councils; and the teachers in them are the servants of these bodies, with whom their appointment and dismissal rest, subject to certain powers of control exercised by the department. In the considerable number of schools maintained by missions or other private associations, the teaching staff are the private servants of their employers.\n\nThe Province has three colleges\u2014a Government college at Jubbulpore, and the Morris and Hislop Colleges at Nagpur. The first of these was affiliated to the Allahabad University in 1891, and the other two were transferred from the Calcutta to the Allahabad University in 1905. The Morris College is managed by a committee and the Hislop College by the mission of the Scottish Free Church, but both receive grants from Provincial and Local funds. The Jubbulpore College teaches up to the B.A. and the two Nagpur Colleges up to the M.A. degree. Statistics of University results are shown below:\n\n| Passes in | 1881 | 1891 | 1901 | 1903 | 1904 |\n|-----------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| Matriculation | 51   | 103  | 121  | 191  | 148  |\n| First or Intermediate in Arts or Science | 16   | 39   | 59   | 27   | 61   |\n| Ordinary Bachelors' degrees | ...  | 19   | 27   | 28   | 12   |\n| Higher and special degrees | ...  | ...  | 2    | ...  | 1    |\n\nIn 1904 the Jubbulpore College had 70 students, the Morris College 99, and the Hislop College 108. Hostels are attached to the Jubbulpore and Hislop Colleges, and to four high schools. No student can now be admitted to a college or any class of school, unless he lives either with his parents or suitable guardians, or in a hostel recognized by the Director of Public Instruction.\n\nInstitutions for secondary education are divided into two grades, high\nschools and middle schools. The high schools prepare pupils for the matriculation or university entrance and the school final examinations. The lower secondary schools are called middle schools of the first or second grade. They may be either English or vernacular. The vernacular middle schools are merely primary schools with one or two extra classes attached according as they are second or first grade, thus continuing the course of primary education for one or two years longer.\n\nIn high schools and the highest classes of English middle schools instruction is given in English. The curriculum for the school final test consists of English reading, grammar, and easy composition, elementary history, geography, and mathematics, including algebra and Euclid, and physics and chemistry, or an Indian classical language. In 1904 there were 27 high schools, 5 supported by Government and 22 under private management, of which 12 were in receipt of Government grants. The number of English middle schools was 79, 70 in British territory and 9 in the Feudatory States. Of the former 7 were maintained by Government, 26 by municipalities, 3 by District councils, and 34 by private persons, 28 of these last being in receipt of Government grants. Vernacular middle schools numbered 155, of which 19 were in the Feudatory States. All those in British territory were supported by municipalities or District councils. In 1904 the high schools contained 1,174 pupils, the English middle schools 6,091, and the vernacular middle schools 19,902 pupils, 2-1 per cent. of the boys in British Districts being in receipt of secondary education in these schools.\n\nImportant reforms have recently been introduced in both subject-matter and methods of teaching in primary schools. Ocular demonstration and instruction by object lessons are insisted on as far as possible. Besides reading, writing, and counting, the course of instruction in primary schools now comprises simple lessons in the structure and growth of plants and methods of agriculture, the preparation of the patwari's village records and registers, the incidents of the different land tenures, the local law of landlord and tenant, and the system of accounts kept by the village money-lenders. A small quantity of Hindu poetry is also learnt by heart. In order to meet the objections of cultivators to being deprived of the services of their children in the fields so that they may attend school, a half-time system has been introduced, by which the children go to school only from 7 to 10 a.m. The masters in primary schools have usually passed through a two years' course in a normal school, in which they are trained to teach intelligently and not by rote. The average pay of a master is Rs. 10 per month. Many schoolmasters receive extra pay for managing village post offices or cattle-pounds, and a few are sub-registrars, and in important schools the pay of the master is usually Rs. 20 a month. In 1904 the number of primary schools for boys was 2,053, of which 28 were maintained by\nGovernment, 1,566 by municipalities and District councils, 281 by the Feudatory States, and 178 by private persons or associations, of which last 117 received grants-in-aid from Government. The total number of boys in receipt of primary education in British Districts was 112,756, or 17 per cent. of the population of school-going age.\n\nFemale education is still in its infancy, but considerable strides have been made in recent years, as is shown by the following statistics of schools and scholars at the end of the last three decades and in 1903-4: (1881) 82 schools with 3,454 pupils; (1891) 135 schools with 7,583 pupils; (1901) 188 schools with 11,208 pupils; (1903-4) 196 schools with 13,630 pupils. Of the total number of girls of school-going age, 1.4 per cent. are now in receipt of instruction, but the vast majority are in primary schools. The attitude of the people towards female education is indifferent or even obstructive. Generally girls of the lower castes only are sent to school. The best girls' schools are under the management of missionary societies. An important change in the management of female education was made in 1902, by the transfer of girls' schools from the control of local bodies to that of the Government. The course of study in girls' schools is nearly the same as for boys, except that needlework is taught as a compulsory subject and the lessons in agriculture and tenures are omitted.\n\nAmong the special educational institutions the following may be mentioned. A Training Institution at Jubbulpore prepares teachers for high, middle, and primary schools. There are also two normal schools for male and two for female teachers in primary schools. An Agricultural school at Nagpur prepares candidates for appointments in the subordinate Revenue and Court of Wards establishments, and has classes for the instruction of primary schoolmasters and the sons of landowners in practical agriculture. An Engineering school at Jubbulpore is designed to train candidates for the lower subordinate appointments of the Public Works department, and of road-overseers for local bodies. Two industrial schools for European and Eurasian children are maintained by the St. Francis de Sales Order in Nagpur, while several industrial schools for native children are managed by different missionary societies, but are not shown in the educational returns. The Rajkumar College at Raipur under a European principal has been established for the instruction of the sons of feudatory chiefs and zamindars.\n\nSchools for European and Eurasian children number 17, all, with the exception of 3 railway schools, being under the management of Roman Catholic or Protestant missions. Of these, 8 give the whole educational course up to the high school standard, while one is a middle and 6 are primary schools. The total number of scholars is 1,346. In 1904, 9 pupils passed the matriculation examination, and 3 the school final.\nAfter leaving school, the students generally enter the railway and telegraph departments or the various public offices.\n\nMuhammadans in the Central Provinces are usually well educated as compared with the general population, the reasons being that nearly half of the whole number live in towns, and also that a large proportion of them are recent immigrants of good social standing. In 1904, 40 per cent. of boys and 2 per cent. of girls of school-going age were in receipt of instruction. The number of Muhammadan boys who take a university course is, however, small.\n\nAmong the depressed castes and aboriginal tribes there is as yet very little education, only 3 per cent. of boys among the forest tribes being at school. Great difficulty is experienced in persuading the forest tribes to send their children to school, and even when the children do go it is probable that only a few of them have sufficient power of concentration to learn successfully. For the impure castes separate schools still exist in the Mar\u0101\u1e6dh\u0101 Districts, and when low-caste boys attend the ordinary schools they are made to sit in the veranda and are not touched. But this prejudice is decreasing, while in the northern Districts separate schools are not required.\n\nThe following table shows the expenditure on education in 1903-4:\n\n| Expenditure on institutions maintained or aided by public funds |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Provincial revenues | District and municipal funds | Fees | Other sources | Total |\n| Rs. | Rs. | Rs. | Rs. | Rs. |\n| Arts and Professional colleges | 27,388 | 1,500 | 16,164 | 17,019 | 62,081 |\n| Training and special schools | 77,621 | ... | ... | ... | 77,642 |\n| Secondary boys' schools | 77,433 | 91,058 | 75,119 | 56,646 | 3,00,856 |\n| Primary boys' schools | 30,346 | 2,96,928 | 14,640 | 70,485 | 4,12,399 |\n| Girls' schools | 45,927 | 2,652 | 16,174 | 40,605 | 1,05,358 |\n| Total | 3,58,715 | 3,92,738 | 1,22,097 | 1,84,786 | 9,58,336 |\n\nThe fees charged for pupils in colleges and schools vary with the income of the parents, ranging from Rs. 5 to Rs. 16 per month in colleges, from Rs. 2 to Rs. 8 in high schools, from 8 annas to Rs. 5 in middle, and from 1 anna to 8 annas in primary schools.\n\nThere is now one school to every 12 villages in British Districts, and one to every 3,772 persons. The percentage of children in receipt of instruction to those of school-going age was 4.6 in 1881, 5.9 in 1891, 7.3 in 1901, and 10 in 1903-4. At the Census of 1901, 327,486 persons, or 3 per cent. of the population, were returned as able to read and write, showing an increase of 70,575 during the preceding decade.\nNearly 6 per cent. of males are literate, but only two in 1,000 of females. Nimar, Jubbulpore, Narsinghpur, Nagpur, and Hoshangabad are the most advanced Districts in respect of education, and the Chhattisgarh Districts the most backward. Among Hindus, the Brahmins, Banias, and Kayasths are enormously in advance of the rest of the community, 50 per cent. or more of adult males in these castes being able to read and write. Among the higher agricultural castes about 10 per cent. of adult males are literate, while the lower castes and forest tribes have only one literate male in 100. About a quarter of the adult Muhammadans can read and write, nearly half the Jains, and practically all Parsis. In respect of female education the Kayasths alone among Hindus have made any visible progress, 2-6 per cent. of their women being literate. Parsi women are nearly always educated. Practically all European and Eurasian adults are literate.\n\nThe development of the Press has taken place entirely during the last two decades, there having been only one private printing press in the Province in 1881. In 1904, 26 presses were in existence in ten Districts, and eleven papers were issued. Of these, one was published in Hindi and Marathi, four in Marathi, and five in Hindi. Two weekly papers are published in English in Nagpur and Jubbulpore, and a Muhammadan paper in Urdu has a fitful existence in Jubbulpore. The native Press has very little influence, no paper having a circulation exceeding 500. The general tone of the papers is moderate and circumspect. In 1903, 34 original works were published, of which the majority were poetical and the remainder principally treatises on religion or languages.\n\nThe record of the provision of institutions for medical relief is one of unbroken progress, which may be traced in Table XVI at the end of this article (p. 114). The work was commenced in Medical. 1861 on the first formation of the Province, and in that year 18 dispensaries were open and 33,000 patients treated. From 1885 the control of the majority of the dispensaries was made over to municipal committees and District councils. In 1904 the total number of dispensaries was 194, 28 of which were classified as state, 84 as maintained from Local funds, and 82 as private. The principal medical institutions are the Mayo Memorial Hospital, Nagpur, opened in 1874, with accommodation for 80 in-patients; the Victoria Hospital, Jubbulpore, opened in 1886 and accommodating 64 in-patients; the Lady Dufferin Hospitals at Nagpur and Raipur and the Lady Elgin Hospital at Jubbulpore, these last three being for females, and containing altogether accommodation for 64 in-patients. Besides the police hospitals, 62 other dispensaries also have accommodation for in-patients, while separate dispensing rooms for male and female patients have been made available in 90 institutions. The total number of persons treated in\nall dispensaries in 1904 was 1,770,000, of whom 14,000 were in-patients, and the expenditure was 2.7 lakhs.\n\nThe Province has two lunatic asylums, at Nagpur and Jubbulpore, both of which were opened in 1866. In 1904 they contained 290 lunatics, and cost Rs. 33,000. Out of 306 cases in which insanity was traced to a definite cause, 29 are shown as hereditary, congenital, or due to secret vice, 17 as occasioned by epilepsy or sunstroke, 30 by the consumption of drugs and spirits, 13 by fever, and 55 by mental distress. Since the passing of the Leprosy Act of 1898 a leper asylum has been opened by Government at Nagpur, which contains at present 30 inmates. Besides this, 7 other leper asylums in Raipur, Bilaspur, Hoshangabad, and Wardha are principally supported by missions, the asylum at Raipur town receiving also contributions from municipal and District funds. About 750 lepers are maintained in these asylums.\n\nVaccination is compulsory only in the municipal towns to which the Vaccination Act has been extended; but it is carried on by itinerant vaccinators all over the Province, including the Feudatory States, and though regarded by certain sections of the community with some dislike, it cannot be said that there is any general antipathy to the operation. Primary vaccination is usually successful in 97 per cent. or more of the total cases. Since 1880, the large majority of children born in British Districts have been vaccinated. Revaccination is performed only in from 10 to 15 per cent. of the cases of primary vaccination. The number of vaccinators employed in 1903-4 was 279, and on an average each vaccinated 1,800 persons. The cost was Rs. 50,000, including the Feudatory States, and the average cost of each successful case 1 anna 9 pies. Inoculation for small-pox was formerly practised, but no cases have been known since 1890.\n\nThe system of retailing pice-packets of quinine through the Post Office was introduced in 1893, although some desultory attempts at providing quinine had been made by local bodies since the year 1885. In 1893, 498 packets, each containing 102 one-piece powders of 5 grains, were issued to the post offices, the amount realized being Rs. 685. Since 1893 the sales have steadily increased; and in 1904, 4,781 packets, containing about 345 lb. of quinine, were issued at a cost of Rs. 5,030. Each packet now contains 7 grains. Besides postmasters, the services of schoolmasters, stamp-vendors, and patwariis are occasionally utilized as vendors.\n\nIn important villages, which are not sufficiently large to be made municipal towns, a small fund is raised for purposes of sanitation, either by a house tax, market dues, or cattle registration fees, the arrangements being in the hands of a small committee of the residents, or of the village headman. Simple rules for the disposal of sewage, the protection of the water-supply, and the preservation of cleanliness in the village\ngenerally are then enforced. Funds for sanitary purposes were being levied in 69 villages in 1904. In all villages the headman is responsible for the enforcement of certain elementary sanitary precautions, and villages are inspected by officers on tour to see that these are carried out. Since 1888 a small sum has been allotted annually for the improvement of tanks and wells from which drinking-water is obtained, and this is supplemented by contributions raised in the villages where work is undertaken. The total amount spent in this manner from 1891 to 1904 was 12\u00bd lakhs; and for this sum 688 tanks and 2,406 wells have been constructed, and 714 tanks and 5,702 wells repaired.\n\nThe work of the Great Trigonometrical Survey was completed in the Province in 1876, when 7,633 square miles had been surveyed by four series of triangles, two running from north to south through Jubbulpore and Bilaspur, and two from east to west through Jubbulpore and Sambalpur. A Topographical survey succeeded the Trigonometrical; but its operations were confined to hill and forest tracts, its object being to construct a topographical map on a scale of 4 inches to the mile by plane-table survey and sketching, and village boundaries were not marked. The Topographical survey was begun in 1862, and in 1873 operations in the Central Provinces were completed, an area of 28,000 square miles having been surveyed. In 1902\u20133 the resurvey of those areas which had been topographically surveyed was commenced, with a view to checking the accuracy of the existing maps. In the open and cultivated areas of the Province the traverse is now substituted for the topographical survey. This survey is carried out by the method of plane-tabling, but on a basis formed by carrying traverses with theodolite and chain round the boundary of the village, in lieu of triangulation from prominent stations. These operations result in the construction of a skeleton map of each village, showing the position of a series of theodolite stations lying round the village boundary. A traverse survey was effected for the settlements of 1863 and subsequent years, and was accompanied by a cadastral survey by fields; but the two operations were carried on independently, and the measurements were plotted on different scales, one being used merely as a check on the other. A complete resurvey was found necessary for the new settlements of 1885 and subsequent years. On this occasion the traverse work was again done by the Survey department, commencing after 1884, and 73,000 square miles have been surveyed, the cost approximating to Rs. 26 per square mile. In the meantime the village patw\u0101ris or accountants were trained in field-plotting by means of the chain; and when they had become competent the skeleton village maps were handed over to them, and the cadastral or field-to-field survey was carried out on a scale of 16 inches to the mile. The cost of the cadastral survey was Rs. 36 per square mile. The\nsurvey extended over 69,000 square miles, and included 47,000 square miles of cultivation, containing 22 million separately surveyed fields. The completion of the field map was followed by the preparation of a set of records giving full details of the ownership, tenancy, rent, and cultivation of every field in the village. From this paper a village rent-roll was drawn up. The field-maps and land records are annually corrected by the patw\u0101ris.\n\nJ.

At Dinjan, 3 miles to the north-east, there is a sattra or priestly college, which is held in great reverence by the Mataks, the indigenous inhabitants of those parts. Ch\u0101bu\u0101 is situated near a station of the same name on the Dibru-Sadiy\u0101 Railway.\n\nChach (Chachch).\u2014Alluvial plain in the north of the District and tahsil of Attock, Punjab, lying between $33^\\circ 53'$ and $33^\\circ 59' N.$ and $72^\\circ 22'$ and $72^\\circ 44' E.$ It is bounded on the north and west by the Indus, and is about 19 miles long from east to west, and 9 miles broad. Percolation from the Indus makes it extremely fertile. Dr. Stein has identified Chach with the Chukhsa or Chuskha country of the Taxila copperplate inscription. In the Muhammadan period it was known as Chach-Haz\u0101ra, or Taht Haz\u0101ra, 'below Haz\u0101ra,' probably because it was subject to the Karlughis who held Haz\u0101ra. In this plain lies HAZRO.\n\n[Indian Antiquary, vol. xxvi, pp. 174-5.]\n\nChach\u0101na.\u2014Petty State in K\u0101thi\u0101war, Bombay.\n\nCh\u0101chro.\u2014T\u0101luka of Thar and P\u0101rkar District, Sind, Bombay, lying between $24^\\circ 44'$ and $26^\\circ 46' N.$ and $69^\\circ 48'$ and $71^\\circ 8' E.$, with an area of 2,795 square miles. The population in 1901 was 40,925, compared with 49,592 in 1891. The t\u0101luka contains 40 villages, of which Ch\u0101chro is the head-quarters. The density, 15 persons per square mile, is slightly below the District average. The land revenue and cesses amounted in 1903-4 to Rs. 49,000. The t\u0101luka is a sandy tract of ridge and plain, and depends entirely upon the rainfall for cultivation and pasture. It is subject to frequent droughts. B\u0101jra is the principal crop.\n\nCh\u0101dargh\u0101t.\u2014Northern suburb of the city of Hyder\u0101b\u0101d, Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State, separated from it by the river M\u016bsi. It derives its name from a dam 12 feet high thrown across the M\u016bsi, over which the water falls like a sheet (ch\u0101dar). This suburb, which contains most of the houses of the Europeans in the service of the Niz\u0101m and also of native officials, has sprung up within the last fifty years. In 1850, with the exception of the Residency and its bazars, there was scarcely a building to be found where houses may be now counted by thousands, many of them fine buildings. It forms the principal section of the Ch\u0101dargh\u0101t branch of the Hyder\u0101b\u0101d municipality. It contains the Roman Catholic Cathedral and All Saints' schools; the old French gun foundry erected by M. Raymond, and referred to by Malcolm (1798) as a place in which 'they cast excellent cannon and made serviceable muskets'; Sir W. Rumbold's house (Rumbold's kothi), now occupied by the Niz\u0101m College; the King kothi, where the Niz\u0101m's eldest son resides;\nthe Public Works Office; the Hyder\u0101b\u0101d College; and the fine buildings known as the Saif\u0101b\u0101d Palace, now used as the offices of the Financial, Public Works, and the Private Secretaries. Adjoining the compound of this palace on the west is the Mint and Stamp Office, an immense building which was completed in 1904. Many other offices and institutions are situated in Ch\u0101dargh\u0101t. The public gardens lie to the north-west, and adjoining them on the south is the Hyder\u0101b\u0101d railway station. Below the Husain S\u0101gar, or tank, an ice factory, a steam saw-mill, and the Hyder\u0101b\u0101d Spinning and Weaving Mills have been established.\n\nCh\u0101dchat.\u2014Petty State in the P\u0101lanpur Agency, Bombay; also known as S\u0101ntalpur.\n\nCh\u0101gai District.\u2014District in Baluchist\u0101n, lying between $28^\\circ 2'$ and $29^\\circ 54'$ N. and $60^\\circ 57'$ and $66^\\circ 25'$ E., with an area of 18,892 square miles. It is bounded on the north by Afgh\u0101nist\u0101n; on the east by the Saraw\u0101n division of the Kal\u0101t State; on the south by Kh\u0101r\u0101n; and on the west by Persia. From Nushki westward to D\u0101lbandin the country consists of a level plain, having a slight westerly slope, with sand-dunes in the centre and on the north. Beyond D\u0101lbandin lies the western corner of the Baluchist\u0101n desert, consisting generally of pebbly plains on the south and sandy desert on the north. Most of the sandhills of this desert are shaped alike, being in the form of a crescent with the horns to the south and the curve to the north. They vary a good deal in height, the tops of the largest being about 60 feet above the plain and sloping down gradually to the horns, where they mingle with the sand. A single line of such hills stretches across the gravel plain from Mashki Ch\u0101h to Reg-i-Wak\u0101b. North of D\u0101lbandin lie the Ch\u0101gai Hills, and to the south is the R\u0101s Koh. The largest river is the Pish\u012bn Lora, known locally as the Dhor. The Kais\u0101r stream debouches into the plain near Nushki. Many hill-torrents carry off the drainage of the Ch\u0101gai Hills, the chief being the Morjen. The District contains the swamp known as the H\u0101m\u016bn-i-Lora.\n\nThe geology displays characteristic desert formations, such as the dried-up beds of salt lakes surrounded by successive tiers of shingle terraces; level flats of dried mud called pat; plains strewn with pebbles called dasht; the gigantic talus or d\u0101man which half buries the straggling hill-ranges; and finally the gradual accumulation of wind-borne sand. The hill ranges contain an interesting series of rocks, in which many of the geological strata characteristic of Baluchist\u0101n have been recognized. Volcanic rocks of the Deccan trap period are well displayed.\n\nThe vegetation consists, for the most part, of a scanty and ill-favoured scrub. Pistachio and tamarisk are the only trees. The saline soil produces varieties of Salsola and Haloxylon; and in the sand-dunes, among\nother plants, two varieties of tamarisk and *Euphorbia* occur. The commonest of the occasional grasses are *Eragrostis cynosuroides*, *Aristida plumosa*, and several species of *Aeluropus*. Asafoetida occurs on the Koh-i-Sult\u0101n.\n\nThe deserts swarm with venomous snakes and scorpions, while skinks (*reg m\u0101hi*) are found in the sandhills. In the remotest parts the wild ass occurs, and the Persian gazelle is fairly common.\n\nThe climate is dry and agreeable in the autumn and spring. From May to September great heat is experienced by day, but the nights are cool. The western half of the District is at this time exposed to the effects of the *bidi-sad-o-bast-res*, or 120 days' wind, which carries with it clouds of sand. The winter is cold. Much sickness is caused by the presence of sulphates in the water, which is often fit for consumption only after distillation. Between 2 and 3 inches of rain are received, chiefly in winter. Snow falls on the hills.\n\nLocal tradition speaks of an Arab and Mongol occupation of the country in early times. In 1740 N\u0101dir Sh\u0101h conferred Nushki as a fief on the chief of Kh\u0101r\u0101n, but it fell into the hands of the Br\u0101huis shortly afterwards and became a *ni\u0101bat* of the Kal\u0101t State. Henry Pottinger visited the country in 1810, and Sir Charles Macgregor in 1877. In 1886 the Amir of Afghanistan sent a force to occupy Ch\u0101gai; but ten years later it fell, with Western Sinjr\u0101ni, within the British sphere, by the decision of the Afghan-Baloch Boundary Commission, and an Assistant Political Agent was thereon placed in charge of the country from Nushki to Rob\u0101t Kila. In 1897 the transit dues levied by the Zagar Mengal chief were abolished, in consideration of an annual payment of Rs. 7,000, of which Rs. 3,600 is devoted to a Mengal levy service. Finally, in June, 1899, the Nushki *ni\u0101bat* was leased to the British Government by the Kal\u0101t State for an annual quit-rent of Rs. 9,000, and a *tahsil* was established. In 1901 a sub-*tahsil* was located at D\u0101lbandin in Ch\u0101gai.\n\nThe population enumerated in 1901 was 15,689; allowing 6,000 for Western Sinjr\u0101ni, where no Census was taken, the total is 21,689. The table on the next page gives statistics of area, &c., by *tahsils* in 1901.\n\nNearly all the inhabitants are Muhammadans of the Sunni sect. The languages spoken are Br\u0101hui, Baluch\u012b, and a little Pasht\u016b. The majority of the people are Br\u0101huis, the principal Br\u0101hui tribes being Zagar Mengals (4,600) and Muhammad Hasnis (4,300). The Rakhsh\u0101nis, another important tribe (3,500), claim to be Baloch. The tribes living in Ch\u0101gai and the Western Sinjr\u0101ni country include Sinjr\u0101nis, D\u0101manis, K\u016brds, and Rekis. In Nushki most of the population are cultivators; elsewhere they are chiefly flock-owners. The permanent villages number thirty-two, including Nushki the head-quarters station.\nAgriculture is in its infancy, and the people are wanting in industry. The cultivated area is considerable only in the Nushki tahsil, but it depends chiefly on uncertain floods. In the d\u0101k or alluvial plain the clay soil is very fertile when irrigated. Between 1899-1900 and 1903-4, about Rs. 28,500 was advanced for the encouragement of cultivation. Large numbers of camels, sheep, and goats are bred. Bullocks and ponies are scarce. The only sources of permanent irrigation are karez and streams, the former numbering twenty-one and the latter seven. In rainy years water raised by means of dams from the Pishin Lora is capable of irrigating immense areas in the d\u0101k lands in Nushki; and, with this object, a dam in the Bur Nullah was constructed by Government in 1903, at a cost of Rs. 14,000, but it was washed away in 1904. It has since been replaced.\n\n| Tahsil       | Area in square miles | Number of towns | Number of villages | Population | Population per square mile |\n|--------------|----------------------|-----------------|--------------------|------------|---------------------------|\n| Nushki       | 2,202                | ...             | 10                 | 10,756     | 5                         |\n| Ch\u0101gai sub-tahsil | 7,283              | ...             | 22                 | 4,933      | One person to 1.5 square miles |\n| Western Sinjran\u012b | 9,407               | ...             | ...                | Not enumerated |                           |\n| Total        | 18,892               | ...             | 32                 | 15,689     | 1                         |\n\nA small establishment is maintained for the protection of the pistachio and tamarisk jungles in the hills east of Nushki. Lead, copper and iron ores, sulphur, gypsum, alunogen, and various ornamental stones, such as Oriental alabaster, occur abundantly, but, owing to the inaccessibility of the region, are of no present industrial value.\n\nThe women make a few rugs in the dar\u012b stitch for home use, which are of good texture and pattern and have fast dyes. Trade converges on Nushki from Seistan, Afghanistan, and Kh\u0101r\u0101n; and the District has acquired much of its importance from the opening of the Nushki-Seistan trade-route connecting India with Persia. During the five years ending 1904 the average value of the total trade on this route was 14.1 lakhs, the exports averaging 7.2 lakhs and the imports 6.9 lakhs. The District itself produces a little wool, gh\u012b, and asafoetida.\n\nA branch of the North-Western Railway on the standard gauge was opened from Spezand to Nushki in 1905. The Nushki-Seistan trade-route has nineteen stages in the 327 miles between Nushki and Rob\u0101t K\u012bla, the frontier station. Shelters have been provided for travellers throughout, and post and telegraph offices and shops are located at\nimportant stages. The distance from Rob\u0101t Kila to Nasrat\u0101b\u0101d, the capital of Seist\u0101n, is 106 miles.\n\nThe peculiar conditions of the country render it liable to prolonged and constant droughts, at which times the people migrate to other parts. The central and western tracts at present depend entirely on the Helmand valley for their grain supply. Famine.\n\nIn 1902 advances amounting to Rs. 4,200 were given for the purchase of seed and plough bullocks.\n\nThe District forms part of the Agency Territories, and is administered under the executive orders of the Governor-General. No laws have yet been formally applied. It is divided into three parts: the Nushki tahsil, the Ch\u0101gai sub-tahsil, and the Western Sinjr\u0101ni country. The executive authority is vested in a Political Assistant, who is assisted by a European Assistant District Superintendent of police, one tahsild\u0101r, and two naib-tahsild\u0101rs. The last three officials are magistrates, with jurisdiction in petty civil suits. Most cases are, however, referred to jirgas or councils of elders. Such cases numbered twenty-five in 1903\u20134, including one murder and one robbery. The number of criminal cases in the same year was four and of civil suits six.\n\nIn Nushki the Kal\u0101t system of levying land revenue at the rate of one-tenth of the produce together with certain cesses has been continued, with certain modifications. Government owns shares in the water of most of the k\u0101rez. In Ch\u0101gai the rate of revenue levied is one-sixth of the produce. Grazing tax is levied in Ch\u0101gai and also on trans-frontier animals grazing in the Nushki tahsil. A tax in kind is collected on asafoetida. In 1903\u20134 the land revenue of the District amounted to Rs. 17,000, and the revenue from all sources to Rs. 26,000.\n\nA detachment of infantry is stationed at Nushki. The local levies, under the Assistant District Superintendent of police, numbered 186 in 1904. The regular police force comprises only 11 men, and has been amalgamated since 1903 with the Quetta-Pishin police. Four watchmen are paid from Local funds. The lock-up at Nushki has accommodation for 20 male and 4 female prisoners. A primary school, founded at Nushki in 1904, is attended by 20 boys, and 60 boys receive instruction in the village mosques. A civil dispensary was opened in 1900, with accommodation for 8 in-patients. The average daily attendance of all patients in 1903 was 33. The expenditure, which was borne by Provincial revenues, amounted to Rs. 1,648. Vaccination has not been attempted, and the people still resort to inoculation.\n\n['A Geological Sketch of the Baluchist\u0101n Desert,' Memoirs, Geological Survey of India, vol. xxxi, part ii; The Botany of the Afghan\nCh\u0101gai Sub-Tahsil.\u2014A sub-tahsil of the Ch\u0101gai District, Baluchist\u0101n, lying between 28\u00b0 19' and 29\u00b0 34' N. and 63\u00b0 15' and 65\u00b0 35' E., and bounded by Afghanistan on the north and the R\u0101s Koh hills on the south. The area is 7,283 square miles, and the population (1901) 4,933. For revenue purposes it includes part of Western Sinjr\u0101ni, which covers 9,407 square miles and has an estimated nomadic population of 6,000. This tract consists almost entirely of pebbly plains and sandhills, and is probably the most uninviting area in the whole Province. The water, especially in summer, is impregnated with sulphates. The people of Ch\u0101gai are essentially pastoral, and so far have exhibited little aptitude for agriculture. They own large flocks of sheep and herds of camels. The permanent villages number twenty-two, of which D\u0101lbandin is the head-quarters. In 1903-4 the land revenue amounted to Rs. 6,100, about half of which consisted of the proceeds of the grazing tax.\n\nCh\u0101gai and R\u0101s Koh Hills.\u2014The Ch\u0101gai Hills (28\u00b0 46' to 29\u00b0 34' N. and 63\u00b0 18' to 64\u00b0 50' E.) are a range of mountains in the north of the District of the same name in Baluchist\u0101n. They have never yet been entirely explored. Their general strike is east and west, the main mass being about 90 miles long by 35 broad, lying to the west of the Ham\u016bn-i-Lora at a mean elevation of about 6,000 feet. The range extends farther westward, however, in a series of scattered volcanic ranges, the chief of which is the Koh-i-Sult\u0101n. The principal peaks of the main mass are M\u0101r\u0101n (7,309 feet), Malik Tezn\u0101n (7,686 feet), and Malik N\u0101ru (7,915 feet). Here and there are open plains containing slight cultivation and probably capable of development. The geological structure consists chiefly of basic and acid igneous rocks, with occasional outcrops of quartz and diorite. Terraces of travertine or Oriental alabaster occur at the western end of the main mass. The inhabitants are few and are principally nomad Baloch. The Koh-i-Sult\u0101n, which is separated from the main range by a sandy plain, is an oval-shaped mountain about 20 miles long by 14 wide. It is an extinct volcano with three distinct cones. Its most remarkable feature is the Neza-i-Sult\u0101n, 'the sultan's spear,' a huge natural pillar about 300 feet in diameter and 800 feet high. West of the Koh-i-Sult\u0101n rises another extinct volcano called Damodim. On the south, the Ch\u0101gai Hills are connected with the R\u0101s Koh Hills by the D\u0101lbandin plain. The latter range lies between 28\u00b0 25' and 29\u00b0 13' N. and 63\u00b0 57' and 66\u00b0 0' E. It is an extension, about 140 miles in length, of the Khw\u0101ja Amr\u0101n offshoot of the Toba-K\u0101kar range, and takes its name from its highest peak, nearly 10,000 feet above sea-level. It gradually sinks westward beneath the superficial deposits of the Western Sinjr\u0101ni desert. The\nwatershed roughly divides Kh\u0101r\u0101n from Ch\u0101gai. Though the general direction is north-east to south-west, the component ridges have many irregularities in strike. Geologically also the formation is complex, consisting now of Tertiary limestone, now of flysch, and now of igneous outcrops, which are best represented by the R\u0101s Koh peak. Other peaks are Shaikh Husain (6,875 feet), where a shrine of some local importance exists, and Kambr\u0101n (8,518 feet). Vegetation is extremely scanty and the ridges rise bare and barren. Good bags of Sind ibex are sometimes made on them.\n\n**Chaib\u0101sa.**\u2014Head-quarters of Singhbh\u016bm District, Bengal, situated in 22\u00b0 33' N. and 85\u00b0 49' E., on rising ground overlooking the right bank of the Raro river. Population (1901), 8,653. Chaib\u0101sa was constituted a municipality in 1875. The income during the decade ending 1901-2 averaged Rs. 8,000, and the expenditure Rs. 7,000. In 1903-4 the income was Rs. 12,000, mainly derived from a tax on houses and lands, a conservancy rate, and a tax on vehicles; and the expenditure was Rs. 10,000. The town lies within the Kolh\u0101n Government estate. It contains the usual public offices. The District jail has accommodation for 230 prisoners, who are employed on oil-pressing, cloth, dari and carpet-weaving, and sabai string-making.\n\n**Chail.**\u2014Sanitarium and summer residence of the Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101 of Pati\u0101la, in the Pinjaur tahsil and nis\u0101mat, Pati\u0101la State, Punjab, situated in 30\u00b0 58' N. and 77\u00b0 15' E., 19 miles (26 by road) south of Simla, at an elevation of 7,394 feet above sea-level. It was originally a possession of the Keonthal State, from which it was wrested by the Gurkhas in 1814. After the Gurkha War the British Government transferred it, with other portions of the Keonthal and Bagh\u0101t States, to Pati\u0101la in 1815. The station contains the handsome villa of the Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101, the guesthouse (generally known as the Dharm\u0101la), and the Political Agent's house and offices. Water-works have been constructed. The population at the Census of March, 1901, was only 20, but during the summer months it rises to about 1,000.\n\n**Chainpur.**\u2014Village in the Bhabu\u0101 subdivision of Sh\u0101h\u0101b\u0101d District, Bengal, situated in 25\u00b0 2' N. and 83\u00b0 31' E., 7 miles west of Bhabu\u0101 town. Population (1901), 2,870. The place was formerly the residence of the Chainpur R\u0101j\u0101s, who were expelled by the Path\u0101ns about 250 years ago. The old fort of Chainpur is surrounded by a ditch, and defended by a stone rampart flanked with bastions; it has a large gate in the northern and a smaller one in the southern curtain. The space within is covered with buildings, partly of brick and partly of stone, with several large wells. A mosque built as a tomb over Fateh Kh\u0101n, who married a daughter of the emperor Sher Sh\u0101h, is still in good condition.\n\n**Chaj (Jech) Do\u0101b.**\u2014A do\u0101b or 'tract lying between two rivers'\n(the Chen\u0101b and Jhelum) in the Punjab, lying between $31^\\circ 10'$ and $33^\\circ 0'$ N. and $72^\\circ 7'$ and $74^\\circ 3'$ E., and comprising Gujrat and parts of Sh\u0101hpur and Jhang Districts. The name was formed by the Mughal emperor Akbar, by combining the first syllables of the names of the two rivers.\n\n**Ch\u0101kan.**\u2014Market village in the Khed taluka of Poona District, Bombay, situated in $18^\\circ 45'$ N. and $73^\\circ 32'$ E., 6 miles south of Khed and 18 miles north of Poona. Population (1901), 4,197. Ch\u0101kan fort is nearly square, with bastioned fronts and corner towers. A portion of the outworks is said to be the remains of a fortification made in 1295 by an Abyssinian chief. Ch\u0101kan first came into notice in 1443, when Malik-ut-Tuj\u0101r, the leading Bahmani noble, who was ordered by Al\u0101-ud-d\u012bn II (1435\u201358) to reduce the sea-coast or Konkan forts, fixed on Ch\u0101kan as his head-quarters. From this time Ch\u0101kan and Jumnar continued military posts. In 1486 Malik Ahmad, the founder of the Ahmadnagar dynasty, seized the fort. In 1595 Bah\u0101dur, the tenth Ahmadnagar king, granted the fort to M\u0101loji Bhonsla, Sivaji's grandfather, and it thus came into Sivaji's possession. In 1662 it was captured by Shaista Kh\u0101n, the Mughal general, but was restored to Sivaji by Aurangzeb in 1667. In 1818 the fort was taken without much difficulty from the Mar\u0101th\u0101s by Lieutenant-Colonel Deacon. The village contains three schools with 206 boys and 22 girls, besides a school maintained by a branch of the Church Missionary Society.\n\n**Ch\u0101kdaha.**\u2014Town in the R\u0101n\u0101gh\u0101t subdivision of Nadi\u0101 District, Bengal, situated in $23^\\circ 6'$ N. and $88^\\circ 33'$ E., on the left bank of the Hooghly river. Population (1901), 5,482. Ch\u0101kdaha was constituted a municipality in 1886. The income and expenditure during the decade ending 1901\u20132 averaged Rs. 3,800. The income in 1903\u20134 was Rs. 3,900, mainly derived from a tax on persons (or property tax); and the expenditure was Rs. 4,800. Ch\u0101kdaha is a centre of the jute trade, but a change in the course of the river has greatly reduced its importance. It was near this place that Kart\u0101 B\u0101b\u0101, the founder of the Kart\u0101bhaj\u0101 sect, was born.\n\n**Chakdarra.**\u2014A military post to the north-east of the Malakand Pass, on the south bank of the Sw\u0101t river, in the D\u012br, Sw\u0101t, and Chitr\u0101l Agency, North-West Frontier Province, situated in $34^\\circ 44'$ N. and $72^\\circ 8'$ E. Like the Malakand, it was fortified by Akbar's general Zain Kh\u0101n in 1587, in his attempt to conquer Sw\u0101t. In 1895 the Chitr\u0101l relief force crossed the Sw\u0101t river at Chakdarra, which was garrisoned and retained as an outpost on the conclusion of the campaign. In July, 1897, Chakdarra was besieged by 8,000 tribesmen who had attacked the Malakand under the Mull\u0101 Mast\u0101n or 'Mad Mull\u0101,' but its hard-pressed garrison was relieved on August 2.\n\n**Chaki\u0101.**\u2014North-eastern tahsil of Mirz\u0101pur District, United Pro-\nvinces, belonging to the Benares Estate, conterminous with pargana Ker\u0101 Mangraur, and lying between $24^\\circ 56'$ and $25^\\circ 15'$ N. and $83^\\circ 13'$ and $83^\\circ 25'$ E., with an area of 474 square miles. Population fell from 70,914 in 1891 to 66,601 in 1901. There are 415 villages, but no town. The density of population, 141 persons per square mile, is below the District average. Chaki\u0101 stretches from the Gangetic valley to the centre of the Vindhyan plateau, and the greater part lies on the latter. The northern portion is a fertile level plain producing rice; but the plateau is a waste expanse of hill and jungle, most of which forms a game preserve. The southern portion is usually known as the Naugarh taluka. The Karamn\u0101s\u0101 and its tributary the Chandraprabh\u0101 drain the tahsil, flowing from south to north. Agricultural records are maintained for only 160 square miles, of which 109 were under cultivation in 1903-4, and 27 square miles were irrigated, almost entirely from wells. The whole tahsil is held free of revenue.\n\nChakki-no-Aro (or 'Grindstone Bank').\u2014Place of pilgrimage on the Kar\u0101d river in the Kalol taluka of the Panch Mah\u0101ls District, Bombay, situated in $22^\\circ 35'$ N. and $73^\\circ 35'$ E., between the villages of Medapur and Marva. In the middle of the river where the channel is deepest stands a large rock, over which, in ordinary course, the stream would flow in a cascade into the deep pool below. But above the rock a rectangular reservoir has been built, about 15 feet square, and 4 to 5 feet deep, partly of brick and partly of rock, the large rock forming its lower side. Into this the water of the river runs, and passes out of it, not over the large rock, but by a channel, 6 to 8 feet long, cut from the deepest part of the reservoir right through the centre of the rock. Out of this the water spouts and falls into a deep pool several feet below. At eclipses of the sun, and at the Mahoda Parv or Somvati Am\u0101s, when the last day of the month falls on a Monday, and also on other occasions, Br\u0101hmans, R\u0101jputs, and V\u0101nis come to bathe and wash away their sins in the pool. The legend is that a certain R\u0101j\u0101 Sulochan of Benares was troubled with a growth of hair on the palms of his hands, sent him as a punishment for his sins. As none of the Benares seers could cure him, he was advised to go to the famous Vishv\u0101mitra, who lived where P\u0101v\u0101garh now stands. Vishv\u0101mitra told him that if he sacrificed at a spot in the river where a sacred grindstone lay, his sins should be destroyed as grain is ground to powder in a grindstone. The R\u0101j\u0101 went to the spot, built a place of sacrifice, and cut a conduit in the rock through which to feed with butter the fire of his sacrifice. The river became known as the Kar ('hand'), since corrupted into Kar\u0101d Ganga, and the place of sacrifice as the Chakki-no-Aro or 'grindstone bank.' Half the grindstone is still there, the other half was stolen by a Gosain, who, being pursued, threw it away where it still lies between the villages of Viasra and Al\u0101li in Kalol.\nChakla Roshnabad.\u2014A permanently settled estate, with an area of 570 square miles, belonging to the Raj\u0101 of Hill Tippera, situated in the Eastern Bengal Districts of Tippera and Noakhali, and in the Assam District of Sylhet. In 1901\u20132 the demand for revenue was 1.53 lakhs and for cesses Rs. 56,000; the annual income from rents and cesses is 8 lakhs.\n\nThe estate originally formed part of the State of Hill Tippera, which came into the possession of the Muhammadans in 1733. The Muhammadans never troubled themselves about the hills, but they assessed the plains to revenue, and the East India Company followed their example. The revenue assessed at the Permanent Settlement in 1793 was s\u012bca Rs. 1,39,676. At the request of the Raj\u0101, the estate was brought under survey and settlement in 1892\u20139, and the final report supplies complete information regarding it. Excluding the portion in Sylhet, which was not surveyed, the area measured was 558 square miles, of which 401 were cultivated, 39 cultivable waste, and the rest was made up of uncultivable lands and water; 517 square miles were rent-paying, and of this area 252 square miles were held direct by ryots, 208 square miles by tenure-holders with variable rents, and the balance by tenure-holders at fixed rents. The tendency is towards subdivision of the tenures rather than in the direction of further sub-infeudation. The average area of a ryot\u2019s holding is 3\u00bd acres, from which he derives a net income of Rs. 133 per annum. Rice covered four-fifths of the cultivated area, the other important crops being jute (8,000 acres), chillies (6,700 acres), mustard (4,932 acres), and sugar-cane (1,687 acres). The population of the estate in 1891 was 467,000, or 837 persons per square mile. The settlement increased the rental of the estate from 5.84 lakhs to 6.76 lakhs, or by 16 per cent., the cost of the operations being 5.28 lakhs, or Rs. 1\u20138 an acre.\n\nChakl\u0101si.\u2014Town in the Nadi\u0101d taluka of Kaira District, Bombay, situated in 22\u00b0 39' N. and 72\u00b0 57' E. Population (1901), 7,340. In 1898 an outbreak occurred here among persons of the Dharila caste, who had been led to believe that the British Government had ceased to exist. The police were at first repulsed, but eventually arrested the ringleaders. The town contains a boys\u2019 school with 303 pupils.\n\nChakma.\u2014One of the three circles into which the Chittagong Hill Tracts, Eastern Bengal and Assam, are divided for administrative purposes. It occupies the centre and north of the District, lying between 22\u00b0 7' and 23\u00b0 13' N. and 91\u00b0 43' and 92\u00b0 36' E., with an area of 2,421 square miles. It is a land of hills and valleys, bounded on the south by the Bomong circle, on the north-west by the Mong circle, on the north and east by forest Reserves, and on the west by the District boundary. Population (1901), 48,789, having increased by 7.1 per cent. since 1891. The people mostly belong to a tribe known as Chakm\u0101s.\nCHAKR\u0100T\u0100 TOWN\n\n(see CHITTAGONG HILL TRACTS), and the circle is administered by the Chakm\u0101 R\u0101j\u0101. There are 94 villages, one of which, R\u0101ng\u0101m\u0101ti, is the residence of the chief and the head-quarters of the District. The present chief is R\u0101j\u0101 Bhuban Mohan Rai.\n\nChakradharpur.\u2014Village in Singhbh\u016bm District, Bengal, situated in 22\u00b0 41' N. and 85\u00b0 37' E., on the Bengal-Nagpur Railway, 194 miles from Calcutta. Population (1901), 4,854. It is an important railway centre.\n\nChakr\u0101t\u0101 Tahsil (Chakraut\u0101).\u2014Northern tahsil of Dehra D\u016bn District, United Provinces, better known under its earlier name of Jauns\u0101r-B\u0101war. It lies between 30\u00b0 31' and 31\u00b0 2' N. and 77\u00b0 42' and 78\u00b0 5' E., and forms a roughly elliptical mass of mountains, stretching due north from the outer range of the Himalayas. The southern half lies between the Tons (Northern) and Jumna rivers. The whole tract is so hilly that in its entire area of 478 square miles scarcely a single level space of 100 yards occurs anywhere, and only 31 square miles are cultivated. The population rose from 50,697 in 1891 to 51,101 in 1901. The tahsil contains two towns: the cantonment of Chakr\u0101t\u0101 (population, 1,250), and the small town of K\u0101ls\u012b (760), which is administered under Act XX of 1856. There are thirty-nine khatts or revenue divisions, and several hundred inhabited sites. In 1903-4 the demand for land revenue was Rs. 23,400, and for cesses Rs. 3,800. The low density of population, only 107 persons per square mile, is usual in the Himalayan tract. The rainfall at Chakr\u0101t\u0101 averages 80 inches, being slightly less than in the rest of the District. The inhabitants resemble those of the neighbouring Himalayan tracts, and differ from the people in the plains. Polyandry is common. The Jauns\u0101r-B\u0101war Forest division has an area of 142 square miles, and is managed jointly with 153 square miles of forests leased from the neighbouring Native States. The forests contain very valuable timber trees, especially deodar and various kinds of pines. Railway sleepers and other timber are transported to the Jumna by an ingenious system of slides, and then floated down to Delhi. The provisions of the Excise Act of 1896 are relaxed, except in the towns of Chakr\u0101t\u0101 and K\u0101ls\u012b, and the inhabitants are allowed to make spirits and fermented liquor for their own use. There is also a small cultivation of poppy which is not controlled, but this privilege will expire with the present settlement.\n\nChakr\u0101t\u0101 Town (Chakraut\u0101).\u2014Cantonment and tahsil headquarters in Dehra D\u016bn District, United Provinces, situated in 30\u00b0 42' N. and 77\u00b0 52' E., 25 miles from K\u0101ls\u012b and 40 miles west of Mussoorie along the hills, at an elevation of 6,885 feet above the sea. The cold-season population has varied since 1872 between 1,200 and 1,500, and was 1,250 in 1901. The present garrison consists of a regiment of\nBritish infantry; and there is a standing camp at Kail\u0101na, a short distance east of Chakr\u0101t\u0101, where details from various regiments are stationed. In September, 1900, the troops numbered 1,716 with women and children, and the total population was 5,417. The cantonment was founded in 1866, and first occupied in 1869. A fine cart-road, 77 miles long, connects it with Sah\u0101ranpur, a branch from which passes along the valley of the D\u016bn to Dehra. The income and expenditure of the cantonment fund are about Rs. 16,000 annually. A brewery is established here, the number of hands employed in 1903 being 30, and the out-turn 88,000 gallons.\n\nCh\u0101ksu.\u2014Tahsil in the Jaipur State, R\u0101jput\u0101na. See CH\u0100TSU.\n\nChakw\u0101l Tahsil.\u2014North-western tahsil of Jhelum District, Punjab, lying between 32\u00b0 45' and 33\u00b0 13' N. and 72\u00b0 32' and 73\u00b0 13' E., with an area of 1,904 square miles. The population in 1901 was 160,316, compared with 164,912 in 1891. It contains the towns of Chakw\u0101l (population, 6,520), the head-quarters, and Bhaun (5,340); and 248 villages. The land revenue and cesses amounted in 1903\u20134 to 3.3 lakhs. The southern portion runs up into the Salt Range, and includes the Chail peak, 3,701 feet above the sea, the highest point in the District. Between this and the Soh\u0101n river, which follows more or less the northern boundary, the country consists of what was once a fairly level plain, sloping down from 2,000 feet at the foot of the hills to 1,400 feet in the neighbourhood of the Soh\u0101n; but the surface is now much cut up by ravines and is very difficult to travel over.\n\nChakw\u0101l Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the tahsil of the same name in Jhelum District, Punjab, situated in 32\u00b0 56' N. and 72\u00b0 52' E., in the Lundi Patti plain, 55 miles due west of Jhelum town. Population (1901), 6,530. A light railway from Mandra to Chakw\u0101l has been suggested, but has not yet been surveyed. Shoes and parti-coloured cotton cloth are made. The town is administered as a 'notified area,' and contains an Anglo-vernacular middle school, maintained by the District board, and a Government dispensary.\n\nChalan Bil.\u2014Marshy lake situated on the borders of R\u0101jsh\u0101hi and P\u0101bna Districts in Eastern Bengal and Assam, between 24\u00b0 10' and 24\u00b0 30' N. and 89\u00b0 10' and 89\u00b0 20' E. The length from north-west to south-east is 21 miles; the greatest breadth 10 miles; and the total area about 150 square miles in the rains, shrinking to 20 square miles during the dry season, when the average depth is 3 feet. A tortuous navigable channel runs through it, with a depth of from 6 to 12 feet all the year round. The principal feeder of the lake is the Atrai, whose waters eventually find their way into the Brahmaputra through an outlet at the south-east corner. Land to the south and east which once formed part of the marsh is now dry; but its waters are encroaching towards the north-west, and to prevent this, commissioners have been appointed\nto carry out a scheme for the removal of obstructions to the drainage. The lake abounds in fish and waterfowl, and the value of the annual export of fish is estimated at Rs. 60,000.\n\nCh\u0101lisgaon Taluka.\u2014Taluka of East Kh\u0101ndesh District, Bombay, lying between 20\u00b0 16' and 20\u00b0 41' N. and 74\u00b0 46' and 75\u00b0 10' E., with an area of 501 square miles. It contains one town, Ch\u0101lisgaon (population, 10,243), the head-quarters; and 132 villages. The population in 1901 was 90,837, compared with 74,880 in 1891. A proportion of the increase was due to immigration from the Niz\u0101m's territory during the last famine. The density, 181 persons per square mile, is above the District average. The demand for land revenue in 1903-4 was 2 lakhs, and for cesses Rs. 15,000. Ch\u0101lisgaon is situated in the extreme south of the District at the foot of the S\u0101tm\u0101la range, which, running east and west like a wall, separates Kh\u0101ndesh from the Deccan uplands. It is watered by the Girm\u0101 river, which flows from west to east through the northern villages, and by its tributaries the Many\u0101d and Tittur, which in their turn are fed by several minor streams. Besides these and the J\u0101mda canal, about 3,700 wells supply irrigation. The soil is mixed, much of it towards the south, south-west, and north being hard and stony. The black soil of the Girm\u0101 valley, though better than in the surrounding parts, is generally poor, as it rests on a subsoil of either gravel or rock.\n\nCh\u0101lisgaon Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the taluka of the same name in East Kh\u0101ndesh District, Bombay, situated in 20\u00b0 27' N. and 75\u00b0 1' E., on the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, 35 miles south of Dh\u016blia, with which it is connected by a branch line opened in 1900. Population (1901), 10,243. The town is of little importance, except as being the head-quarters of a taluka, although its trade has much increased since the opening of the railway. It contains a dispensary and five schools with 400 pupils, of which one, with 31 pupils, is a girls' school. A branch of the American Alliance Mission works here.\n\nChalk Hills.\u2014The name given to a barren tract of hilly ground in the Salem taluk of Salem District, Madras, lying between 11\u00b0 42' and 11\u00b0 47' N. and 78\u00b0 7' and 78\u00b0 12' E., north and north-west of Salem city. Over the greater part of this area the surface is whitened by numerous veins of magnesite, the white colour of which has given the locality its name. The magnesite deposits cover about 12 square miles, stretching from a little west of the railway north-eastward to the foot of the Shevaroys. They are said to be the largest of the small number of such deposits which are known, and are now being worked.\n\nChallakere.\u2014North-eastern taluk of Chitadroog District, Mysore, lying between 14\u00b0 4' and 14\u00b0 37' N. and 76\u00b0 27' and 77\u00b0 2' E., with an area of 788 square miles. The population in 1901 was 74,035,\ncompared with 60,711 in 1891. There are two towns, N\u0101yakanhatti (population, 2,858) and Challakere (2,000), the head-quarters; and 192 villages. The land revenue demand in 1903-4 was Rs. 1,10,000. The Vedavati flows through the east from south to north, receiving two streams from the west. The surface of the t\u0101luk is comparatively flat, with a few rocky ridges or bare hills. Date groves occur in some parts, and groups of bab\u016bl in tank-beds and along the river. Except for these, the country generally presents a bleak and barren appearance. An area of 104 square miles is occupied by Amrit Mahal grazing-grounds. The soil is mostly red and sandy, but in the south-west corner there is some good black soil. The surface is often covered with loose stones, solid rock constantly crops up, and enormous boulders are found even in the cultivated fields. In many villages the soil is impregnated with saline matter, which causes a white efflorescence on the surface. This soil is cultivated, but produces very poor crops. The tanks are numerous, but few are of the first class. Wells are more relied upon, many of which tap tulpargis or spring-heads. Great attention is paid to the cultivation of rice and other irrigated cereals, as well as to the coco-nut and areca-nut gardens, but 'dry-crop' cultivation is carried on in a slovenly and careless manner. Sajje and s\u012bve are the principal 'dry crops,' but castor-oil, horse-gram, r\u0101gi, and jow\u0101r are also grown. The two latter, however, as well as wheat, navane, and tobacco, are almost always raised on irrigated lands. Cotton is grown in small quantities, chiefly on the black soil.\n\nChaman Subdivision.\u2014The most northerly subdivision and tahsil of the Quetta-Pishin District, Baluchist\u0101n, lying between 30\u00b0 28' and 31\u00b0 18' N. and 66\u00b0 16' and 67\u00b0 19' E. It is bordered on the north by Afghanistan. The greater part consists of the mountainous region called Toba, which has a mean elevation of about 8,000 feet, though its western skirts descend to about half that height. There is little cultivation, pasture being the principal means of livelihood. The area is 1,236 square miles, and the population in 1901 was 16,437, showing an increase of 5,375 since 1891. The only place of importance is the head-quarters, Chaman Town (population, 2,233). The indigenous Achakzai Afgh\u0101ns are nomadic, and permanent villages are practically unknown. They pay as revenue a lump assessment of Rs. 8,000 per annum.\n\nChaman Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the Chaman subdivision of the Quetta-Pishin District, Baluchist\u0101n, and the frontier terminus of the North-Western Railway, situated in 30\u00b0 56' N. and 66\u00b0 26' E., at an elevation of 4,311 feet above sea-level. It is the head-quarters of a Native Assistant. Population (1901), 2,233. The garrison consists of a regiment of native infantry and some cavalry occupying the fort. A supply of water is brought in pipes from the Bogra stream, the system\nhaving cost 2\u00bd lakhs. The conservancy of the civil station is provided for from the Pishin bazar fund.\n\nChamardi.\u2014Petty State in K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r, Bombay.\n\nCh\u0101marlakota.\u2014Town in God\u0101vari District, Madras. See S\u0101mal-kot.\n\nChamba State.\u2014Native State in the Punjab, under the political control of the Commissioner, Lahore Division, lying between 32\u00b0 10' and 33\u00b0 13' N. and 75\u00b0 45' and 77\u00b0 3' E., with an estimated area of 3,216 square miles, and shut in on almost every side by lofty hill ranges. It is bounded on the west and north by the territories of Kashmir, and on the east and south by the British Districts of Kangra and Gurdaspur. Two ranges of snowy peaks and glaciers run through the State: one through the centre, dividing the valleys of the R\u0101vi and the Chen\u0101b; the other along the borders of Lad\u0101kh and British L\u0101hul. To the west and south stretch fertile valleys. The country is wholly mountainous, and the principal rivers are the Chandra and R\u0101vi, which flow generally from south-east to north-west.\n\nGeologically, the State possesses all the characteristics of the North-West Him\u0101layas, though local details vary. Along the southern margin of the mountain region are found the lower Siwalik or N\u0101han sandstones and the upper Siwalik conglomerate. Along the southern margin the N\u0101han series predominate. At the higher elevations the flora is that common to the North-West Him\u0101layas generally, but some Kashmir types find their eastern limit in the western valleys. In the R\u0101vi basin and P\u0101ngi, Cedrus Deodara and other conifers abound, and there is also a good deal of mixed forest. Chamba L\u0101hul has an almost purely Tibetan flora. Chamba is a favourite resort of sportsmen, and the mountain ranges abound with game, comprising the black and brown bear, leopards, Kashmir stag, ibex, goral, barking-deer, th\u00fcr, serow, and snow leopard. The musk deer is found in many parts. Among game-birds, the chikor, snow partridge, and five species of pheasant are common. Fish are found in the larger streams. With altitudes of 2,000 to 21,000 feet every variety of climate may be experienced. That of the lower tracts resembles the plains, except that the heat in summer is less intense. In the central parts the heat in summer is great, but the winter is mild and the snowfall light. On the higher ranges, at altitudes of from 5,000 to 20,000 feet, the summer is mild, and the winter severe with heavy snowfall. The autumn months are generally unhealthy, except on the upper ranges, the lower valleys being malarious. In the lower valleys the rains are heavy and prolonged. In the R\u0101vi valley the rainy season is well marked and the rainfall considerable. In the Chen\u0101b valley it is scanty, heavy rain is unusual, and the annual average does not exceed 10 inches. Rain also\nfalls in the winter months, and is important for both the spring and autumn crops, as on the higher ranges it is received as snow, which melts in summer and supplies water for irrigation.\n\nThe Chamba State possesses a remarkable series of inscriptions, mostly on copperplates, from which its chronicles have been completed and authenticated. Founded probably in the sixth century by Marut, a S\u016brajbansi R\u0101jput, who built Br\u0101hmapura, the modern Br\u0101hmaur, Chamba was extended by Meru Varma (680), and the town of Chamba built by S\u0101hil Varma about 920. The State maintained its independence, acknowledging at times a nominal submission to Kashmir, until the Mughal conquest of India. Under the Mughals it became tributary to the empire, but its internal administration was not interfered with, and it escaped almost unscathed from Sikh aggression. The State first came under British influence in 1846. The part west of the R\u0101vi was at first handed over to Kashmir, but subsequently the boundaries of the State were fixed as they now stand, and it was declared independent of Kashmir. In 1848 a sanad was given to the R\u0101j\u0101, assigning the territory to him and his heirs male, who are entitled to inherit according to Hindu law, and on failure of direct issue to the heirs of the brothers according to seniority. A sanad of 1862 confers the right of adoption. R\u0101j\u0101 Gop\u0101l Singh abdicated in 1873, and was succeeded by R\u0101j\u0101 Sh\u0101m Singh, who abdicated in 1904 in favour of the present R\u0101j\u0101, Bhuri Singh, K.C.S.I., C.I.E., an enlightened and capable ruler. The R\u0101j\u0101 is entitled to a salute of 11 guns. The principal antiquities are described in the articles on CHAMBA TOWN, BRAHMAUR, and CHITR\u0100DI.\n\nExclusive of Chamba town, the capital, the State contains 1,617 villages. The population at each of the last three enumerations was:\n\n- (1881) 115,773,\n- (1891) 124,032, and\n- (1901) 127,834.\n\nPopulation. The State is divided into five was\u0101r\u0101ts, each subdivided into several il\u0101kas, with head-quarters at kothis in which the revenue in kind is stored. Hindus number 119,327, or 93 per cent, of the population; Muhammadans, 8,332; and Sikhs, 80. Only 22 Buddhists were returned, but there is reason to believe that some Buddhists were enumerated as Hindus. The density of population is only 41 persons per square mile. The principal dialect is Chambialt, which is understood throughout the State, the script being called T\u0101kra. Punjabi, Urdu, and Hindi are also spoken. The population includes a few R\u0101jputs, who form a kind of aristocracy. The Br\u0101hmans, who are of all grades from Gaddis upwards, number 16,126. The Gaddis and others who live at a distance from the capital are engaged in agricultural and pastoral pursuits, but the purists of Chamba and its environs disdain to till the soil themselves. The majority of the population are R\u0101this, a versatile tribe, which takes with equal readiness\nto agriculture, trade, or the service of the State. They seem to be identical with the Kanets of Nahan and the Thakkars of Kashmir. Among the lower castes, Halis (18,000), a caste which hardly exists outside Chamba, Chamars (5,000), Kolts (4,000), and D\u016bmna (2,000) are the most numerous. The great majority of the people depend for their support on the produce of their fields, their flocks, and their rude home industries. The Church of Scotland Mission has a branch, established in 1863, at Chamba town, which also contains a branch of the Church of Scotland Ladies' Association Mission, established in 1877. In 1901 native Christians numbered 60.\n\nThe R\u0101j\u0101 is sole proprietor of all the land. Those who lease land from the State for cultivation are called m\u0101guz\u0101rs (rent-payers). A m\u0101guz\u0101r may, however, sell or mortgage his right of occupancy, and is not ejected so long as he pays his revenue, unless his land is required for a public purpose. The total area under cultivation is 170 square miles, and the area of the forests leased to the British Government 160 square miles. The staple food-crops grown are rice, maize, pulses, millets, and potatoes. The poppy is grown only in the Chaur\u0101h waz\u0101rat. Tea is cultivated in the territory which adjoins Sh\u0101hpur in Kangra District. The State is absolutely secure against famine. The cultivation of hops promised at one time to be important, but has been abandoned. The cattle are generally small and of inferior breed. Buffaloes are mostly kept by Gujar\u0101rs, but villagers also keep them for domestic use. The ponies of the L\u0101hul hills are well-known. Sheep are universally kept, and blankets and clothing are made of the wool. Goats are still more numerous. To irrigate the fields, artificial channels (k\u016bhls) are cut from the hill streams. Their construction and management rest entirely with the people.\n\nBy far the greater and more valuable part of the State forests were leased to Government in 1864 for a term of ninety-nine years, in return for Rs. 21,000 a year. In 1884 the contract was revised, and two-thirds of the net profits was paid to the State during the next twenty years. The forests are alpine, few being below 5,000 feet elevation, and large areas extend to 12,000 feet. Doodar and blue-pine logs, sleepers, and scantlings are largely exported from the forests in Pangi and on the R\u0101vi down the latter river and the Chen\u0101b to Lahore and Waz\u012br\u0101bd. From 1864 to the end of 1903\u20134 the leased forests yielded a revenue of 73-4 lakhs, and cost Government 69-2 lakhs, including all payments made to the State. Under the present contract, which took effect from 1904, the State receives all the net profits. The leased forests are managed by the Imperial Forest department, the officer in immediate charge being the Deputy-Conservator of the Chamba Forest division.\n\nThe mountain ranges are rich in minerals. Iron is found in the Br\u0101hmaur and Chaur\u0101h waz\u0101rats, but the mines are not worked owing\nto the cheapness of imported iron. The copper and mica mines have also been closed. Slate quarries are numerous, especially near Dalhousie, and are profitable.\n\nManufactures are almost unknown. The people make only such things as are required for their daily wants. Brass- and woodwork, dyeing and weaving of the roughest kind, are the sole handicrafts. The trade of the State is confined to the export of honey, wool, ghi, the bark of walnut-trees, walnuts, lac, drugs, pine-nuts, cumin seed, timber and other forest produce. Piece-goods, utensils, salt, sugar, charas, oil, and molasses are the chief imports.\n\nThe principal road to Chamba town is 70 miles long, from Pathankot, the terminus of the Amritsar-Pathankot branch of the North-Western Railway. It passes through Dunera and Dalhousie, tongas running only up to Dunera. From Dunera to Dalhousie it is a camel road under the military authorities. Chamba is only 18 miles from Dalhousie, and the road is well kept up by the State. Another road, shorter but more precipitous, runs from Pathankot through Nurpur in Kangra District to Chamba. Both these roads are closed in winter, when a longer road via Bathri and Chil is used. Near Chamba the Ravi is crossed by an iron suspension bridge which cost the State a lakh. Brahmaur, Pangi, and Chaurah are reached by different roads, all kept up by the State.\n\nThe relations between the British and the State post offices are regulated by the convention of 1886, which provides for a mutual exchange of all postal articles. Indian stamps, surcharged 'Chamba State,' are supplied to the State by the Government of India at cost price, and are sold to the public at their face value by the State post offices. For official correspondence, Indian stamps, surcharged 'Chamba State Service,' are supplied to the State at cost price. For correspondence, &c., addressed to places outside India, the ordinary Indian stamps are used. There are eight post offices in the State, including the central office at the capital. The postal department is under the control of a postmaster-general, and is subject to inspection by the Superintendent of Post Offices, Ambala division.\n\nThe Raj\u00e1 is assisted in the work of administration by the Wasir, who is the chief executive officer, and head of the judicial department, and by the Bakhshi, or chief revenue officer. The Wasir ranks next to the Raj\u00e1, and during the absence of the latter is entrusted with supreme control. Each of the five wasarats, Brahmaur, Chamba, Bhattiyat, Chaurah, and Pangi, is divided into parganas. The revenue is collected by a resident agent, called likhne-hara (village accountant), in each pargana, and under him are ugrakas who realize the revenue from the villagers. The batwal, or village constable, and the jhutiyar, a subordinate under the batwal, with the\nchar at their head, perform other duties, such as arrangements for supplies, &c.\n\nThe permanent State courts are all situated in Chamba town; but a special officer is appointed for each wasarat, with powers resembling those of a tahsildar, except that he can hear civil suits up to Rs. 1,000, and he is required to tour during the summer within the limits of his charge. Appeals from the decisions of these officers are heard by the sadr courts, beyond which an appeal lies to the Wazir and a further appeal to the R\u0101j\u0101. The R\u0101j\u0101 alone has the power to inflict sentences of whipping. Sentences of death passed by him require the confirmation of the Commissioner of Lahore. The Indian Penal Code and the Code of Criminal Procedure are in force in the State, with certain modifications.\n\nThe estimated gross revenue is Rs. 4,58,000, of which Rs. 2,18,000 is derived from land revenue and Rs. 2,39,000 from the leased forests and miscellaneous revenue. The expenditure includes Rs. 3,800 paid as tribute to the British Government.\n\nThe head-quarters of the police are at the capital. The force numbers 100 constables, under a kotwal. The jail at Chamba town has accommodation for 100 prisoners, and each kothi serves as a lock-up. The army consists of 33 cavalry, 270 infantry, and 16 artillerymen, with 4 serviceable guns.\n\nChamba town has two English schools: a high school, with 123 pupils, maintained by the State; and an Anglo-veracular middle school, maintained by the Scottish Mission. The State also maintains a girls' school, and the mission has some girls' and low-caste schools. There were altogether 8 schools for boys and girls, with 206 pupils, in 1905.\n\nThe only hospital is the Sh\u0101m Singh Hospital at Chamba town, with accommodation for 21 male and 10 female in-patients. The latter are treated by a lady Hospital Assistant with a trained nurse. The State also maintains a branch dispensary at Tissa. The whole department is under an Assistant Surgeon. At these institutions 14,217 cases, including 437 in-patients, were treated, and 697 operations performed in 1903. The whole cost, which amounted to Rs. 9,846, is borne by the State. A leper asylum is maintained in connexion with the hospital. Vaccination has become very popular, and the State maintains a separate department under the Assistant Surgeon. In 1903 the number of persons vaccinated was 3,325.\n\n[State Gazetteer (in press).]\n\nChamba Town.\u2014Capital of the Chamba State, Punjab, pictur-\nesquely situated in 32\u00b0 29' N. and 76\u00b0 11' E., on the right bank of the R\u0101vi. Population (1901), 6,000. Shut in by hills on the east and south, it lies on a plateau between the deep gorges of the R\u0101vi on the west and the Saho on the north. It is built on two terraces. On the\nlower is the chaug\u0101n or public promenade and recreation ground, with the Residency (now the State guesthouse) at the southern end, and surrounded by public offices, &c. On the upper terrace stands the palace, with the residences of the State officials and the better class of the townspeople beyond. The town contains a number of interesting temples, of which that of Lakshmi N\u0101r\u0101yan, dating possibly from the tenth century, is the most famous. It also possesses an Anglo-veracular high school and the Sh\u0101m Singh Hospital. The Church of Scotland Mission has a branch here, established in 1863.\n\nChambal.\u2014A river of Central India and R\u0101jput\u0101na, and one of the chief tributaries of the Jumna. It rises in the Indore State, about 9 miles south-west of Mhow cantonment, in the Janapao hill, 2,019 feet above the sea, in $22^\\circ 27' \\text{N.}$ and $75^\\circ 31' \\text{E.}$ Thence it flows down the northern slopes of the Vindhyan range, with a northward course generally, through Gwalior, Indore, and Sit\u0101mau, and skirts Jh\u0101law\u0101r, entering R\u0101jput\u0101na at Chaur\u0101sgarh, 195 miles from its source. It receives many tributaries in Central India, the chief being the Chambl\u0101 and the S\u012bpra, both of which rise in the Vindhyan mountains. In R\u0101jput\u0101na the Chambal breaks through a scarp of the Pat\u0101r plateau, the bed getting narrower and narrower, and after a winding course of 30 miles it receives the B\u0101mani at Bhainsorgarh. Some three miles above the latter place are the well-known cascades or ch\u016blis, the chief of which has an estimated fall of 60 feet. Here whirlpools are formed in huge caverns, 30 and 40 feet in depth, between some of which there is communication underground. Continuing north-east, the river forms for a short distance the boundary between B\u016bndi and Kotah; and near Kotah city it is a broad sluggish stream, very blue in colour, flowing between magnificent overhanging cliffs and rocks rising sheer out of the water, covered with trees and thick brushwood and famous as game preserves. At the city there is a pontoon bridge, replaced by a ferry during the rains in consequence of the high and sudden floods to which the river is subject. Lower down, the Chambal again forms the boundary between Kotah and B\u016bndi, and on its left bank is the interesting old village of Keshorai P\u0101tan. The character of the scenery now alters completely. Above Kotah the neighbouring country is all precipitous rock, with wild glens and gullies and thick tangled overhanging brushwood, while below P\u0101tan there are gently sloping banks, occasionally very picturesquely wooded and much intersected by ravines. Continuing north-east, the river is joined by the K\u0101l\u012b Sind from the south and the Mej from the west, while lower down, where the frontiers of Jaipur, Kotah, and Gwalior meet, the P\u0101rrati flows into it. The Chambal then forms the boundary between Jaipur, Karauli, and Dholpur on the one side and Gwalior on the other. From Jaipur territory it receives the Ban\u0101s, and, flowing under an irregular lofty wall of rock\nalong the whole southern border of Karauli, it emerges into the open country south of Dholpur town. Here it is, during the dry season, a sluggish stream 300 yards wide and 170 feet below the level of the surrounding country; but in the rains it generally rises about 70 feet, and in extreme floods nearly 100 feet above summer level. The breadth then increases to more than 1,000 yards, and the current runs at the rate of 5\u00bd miles an hour. The banks are intersected by a labyrinth of ravines, some of which are 90 feet deep and run back inland for a distance of three miles. At R\u0101jgh\u0101t, three miles south of Dholpur town on the high road between Agra and Bombay, a bridge of boats is kept up between November and June, while a large ferry-boat plies during the rest of the year. A little to the east of this gh\u0101t the river is crossed by a fine railway bridge of thirteen spans. After forming the boundary between the State of Gwalior and Agra and Etawah Districts in the United Provinces, the Chambal crosses the latter, and falls into the Jumna 25 miles south-west of Etawah town. After the two rivers have united, the crystal current of the Chambal may be distinguished for some distance from the muddy waters of the main stream. The total length of the river is about 650 miles, though the distance from its source to its junction with the Jumna is only 330 miles in a straight line. The Chambal is identified with the Charmwati of Sanskrit writers.\n\nCh\u0101mp\u0101mat\u012b.\u2014A river of Assam which rises in Bhut\u0101n, and after a tortuous southerly course through Go\u0101lp\u0101ra District, falls into the Brahmaputra after a course of 125 miles. It is of considerable use as a trade route, timber and rice being exported down its course, while the ordinary stores of the village trader are carried up it into the interior. During the rainy season boats of 4 tons burden can proceed as high as Garubh\u0101s\u0101, but in the dry season cannot get farther than Basug\u0101on. The most important places on its banks are the markets at Garubh\u0101s\u0101 and Ch\u0101par K\u0101zip\u0101ra.\n\nCh\u0101mp\u0101ner.\u2014Ruined city in the K\u0101l\u014dl \u0101h\u0101ka of the P\u0101nch Mah\u0101ls District, Bombay, situated in 22\u00b0 29' N. and 73\u00b0 32' E., 25 miles north of Baroda, at the north-east base of P\u0101v\u0101garh, a fortified hill of great strength. It is a station on the Baroda-Godra chord railway, recently constructed. The name is derived from the champak-tree. The first building of the Musalm\u0101n city was begun in 1483, when Mahm\u016bd Begara was besieging the R\u0101jp\u016bts in P\u0101v\u0101garh. As a sign that he would not leave till the fort was taken, he laid the foundation of a beautiful mosque. The fort fell in 1484, and the R\u0101jp\u016bts fled to Chota Udaipur and Deogarh B\u0101riya, where their descendants still rule. Mahm\u016bd Begara raised a noble city at the base of the hill, bringing his ministers and court from Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d, made it his capital, and styled it Mahm\u016bd\u0101b\u0101d Ch\u0101mp\u0101ner. It grew rapidly and developed a flourishing trade, being especially famous for silk-weaving and the\nmanufacture of sword-blades. It is worthy of note that the materials for its iron industry were found in the adjacent hills. The greatness of Champ\u0101ner was short-lived. In 1535 it was pillaged by the emperor Humayun; and on the death of Sultan Bahadur Shah the capital and court were transferred to Ahmadabad. By the beginning of the seventeenth century its buildings were falling into ruins, the jungle was encroaching, and the climate had greatly deteriorated. When taken by the British in 1803 only 500 inhabitants were found. Several attempts to colonize it have failed on account of the unhealthy climate; and at present the only inhabitants are two Koli families and some pujaris connected with the temple worship on P\u0101v\u0101garh.\n\nThe magnificent ruins of Champ\u0101ner make it a place of great interest. From the spurs on the north-east, the only side on which the hill is accessible, the fortifications of P\u0101v\u0101garh are brought down to the plain and closed by a wall one mile in length running due east and west. Outside this line, and in part replacing the old fortifications, is the Bh\u0101dar, or citadel, of Mahm\u016bd Begara. A perfect rectangle about three-quarters of a mile long and 280 yards broad, the Bh\u0101dar is enclosed by a wall of massive blocks of freestone, strengthened by bastions at regular intervals, and beautified by small carved balconies in the best Musalm\u0101n style. This was the centre of the city, which stretched with fair gardens and beautiful buildings from H\u0101l\u014dl, 4 miles away on the west, to an immense park on the east, the boundaries of which are marked by the traces of an extensive wall. On the north-east was constructed the Bada Talao ('great lake'), fed by a canal from the eastern hills. Ruins of beautiful workmanship are scattered over the whole area, and five of the mosques are still in fair preservation. Of the most notable of these, the J\u0101ma Masjid, which stands about 50 yards from the east gate of the Bh\u0101dar, it may be said that for massive grandeur and perfect finish it is inferior to no Musalm\u0101n building in Western India. To the south-east of the Bh\u0101dar, enclosed by a spur of the overhanging mountain, is a large deep reservoir completely surrounded with stone steps.\n\n[Forbes, Ras M\u0101la; Briggs, Ferishta, vol. iv, p. 70; Hamilton, Hindustan, vol. i, p. 681; Transactions of Bombay Literary Society, vol. i., p. 151; Indian Antiquary, vol. lxii, p. 5, and vol. xliii, p. 7.]\n\nChamp\u0101ran (Champak-aranya, 'the forest of champak' or Michelia Champaca).\u2014District in the Patna Division of Bengal, occupying the north-west corner of Bih\u0101r, lying between 26\u00b0 16' and 27\u00b0 31' N. and 83\u00b0 50' and 85\u00b0 18' E., with an area of 3,531 square miles. The District extends along the left bank of the Gandak for 100 miles, having a breadth of 20 miles at the northern, and 40 miles at the southern extremity. The northern boundary marches with Nep\u0101l; on the west the Gandak separates it from the Gorakhpur District of the\nUnited Provinces, and from the Bengal District of S\u0101ran; while on the east and south it is bounded by Muzaffarpur, from which it is divided on the east by the B\u0101ghmati river. The Nep\u0101l frontier, where not naturally formed by rivers, is marked by ditches and masonry pillars, and for a considerable distance runs along the crest of the Someswar range. At one point the District crosses the Gandak, including a large tract of alluvial land which the river has thrown up on its right bank.\n\nOutliers of the Him\u0101layas extend for 15 miles into the alluvial plain which occupies the rest of the District. The Someswar range, which culminates in a hill of the same name 2,884 feet above sea-level, is generally clothed with fine trees, though in places it rises in bare and inaccessible crags. At its eastern extremity the Kudi river pierces it and forms the pass leading into Deogh\u0101t in Nep\u0101l, through which a British force successfully marched in 1815. The ascent of Someswar hill lies up the bed of the J\u016bri P\u0101ni river amid romantic scenery. The summit overlooks the Mauri valley in Nep\u0101l, and commands an unequalled view of Mount Everest, and of the great snow peaks of Dhaul\u0101giri, Gosainsth\u0101n, and Urnap\u016brn\u0101. A bungalow has been built near the top of the hill. The other principal passes are the Someswar, K\u0101pan, and Harh\u0101. South of the Someswar range the D\u016bn hills stretch across the District. To the north extend forests, in which the finest timber has long been cut, and great expanses of well-watered grass prairie, which afford pasturage to enormous herds of cattle.\n\nThe District is divided by the Burh\u012b ('old') Gandak into two tracts of different characteristics. To the north is old alluvium, where the soil is mainly hard clay suitable for winter rice. The southern tract is recent alluvium deposited during the oscillations of the Gandak, a lighter soil which grows millets, pulses, cereals, and oilseeds. The Burh\u012b Gandak, variously known as the Harh\u0101, the Sikr\u0101na, and the Mas\u0101n, rises in the western extremity of the Someswar range, and is navigable as far as Sagauli by boats of 7 to 15 tons burden, though it is fordable during the dry season. Like the Gandak, the Burh\u012b Gandak becomes a torrent in the rains. The B\u0101ghmati is navigable by boats of 15 to 18 tons burden, and has a very rapid current. In the rains it rises rapidly and overflows its banks, sometimes causing great devastation. This river has often changed its course, and the soil is very light and friable along its banks. Through the centre of the District runs a chain of forty-three lakes, which evidently mark an old bed of the Great Gandak.\n\nThe surface is for the most part covered by alluvium, but the Someswar and D\u016bn hills possess the characteristic features of the lower Him\u0101layan slopes. They consist of gneiss of the well-foliated type, passing into mica schist, while submetamorphic or transition rocks, and\nsandstones, conglomerates, and clays, referable to the Upper Tertiary period, are largely represented.\n\nThe belt of forest along the northern border of the District contains sal (Shorea robusta), sisu (Dalbergia Sissoo), and tun (Cedrela Toona); the cotton-tree (Bombax malabaricum), kusum (Schleichera trijuga), and khair (Acacia Catechu) are also common. Bamboos thrive in the moist tarai tract; sabai grass (Ischoemum angustifolium) and the narkat reed (Amphidoxa falcatia) are also valuable products, and extensive thickets of tamarisk line the Gandak river. In the south cultivation is closer, and the crops leave room for little besides weeds, grasses, and sedges, chiefly species of Panicum and Cyperus, though on patches of waste land thickets of sisu very rapidly appear. The sluggish streams and lakes are filled with water-weeds, the sides being often fringed by reedy grasses, bulrushes, and tamarisk. Near villages, small shrubberies may be found containing mango, sisu, Eugenia Jambolana, various species of Ficus, an occasional tamarind, and a few other semi-spontaneous and more or less useful species. Both the palmyra (Borassus flabellifer) and date palm (Phoenix sylvestris) occur planted and at times self-sown, but neither in great abundance.\n\nTigers and leopards are found in the jungle to the extreme north, and bears are occasionally met with among the lower hill ranges in the same tract. Nilgai (Boselaphus tragocamelus) are fairly distributed over the whole District, while sambar (Cervus unicolor), spotted deer (Cervus axis), barking-deer (Cervulus muntiac), and antelope (Antilope cervicapra) are found in the hills and jungle to the north, and hog deer (Cervus porcinus) in the diaras of the Gandak. Wild hog are common everywhere.\n\nThe mean temperature for the year is $76^\\circ$; the mean maximum rises to $97^\\circ$ in April and May, and the mean minimum drops to $47^\\circ$ in December and January. The mean humidity for the year is 83 per cent., ranging from 68 in April to 92 per cent. in January. Rainfall is heavy in the submontane tract. The annual fall averages 55 inches, including 2.7 inches in May, 10.2 in June, 13.8 in July, 13.2 in August, 9.5 in September, and 3.3 in October; less than one inch falls in each of the other months. Owing to the progress made in clearing the forests, and the extension of cultivation in the north of the District, the rainfall is decreasing, while the extremes of temperature are becoming more marked and the mean temperature is rising.\n\nThe District, which was formerly subject to destructive floods from the Gandak and B\u0101ghmati, has been protected from the former river by a Government embankment; only a small area near the Burhi Gandak and B\u0101ghmati rivers is now liable to inundation.\n\nLocal traditions, archaeological remains, and the ruins of old-world cities point to a prehistoric past. Champ\u0101ran was, in early Hindu\ntimes, a dense primateval forest, in whose solitudes Br\u0101hman hermits studied the Aranyakas, which, as their name implies, were to be read in sylvan retreats. Thus the sage V\u0101lmiki, in whose hermitage S\u012bt\u0101 is said to have taken refuge, is alleged to have resided near the village of Sangr\u0101mpur, so named from the famous fight which took place there between R\u0101ma and his sons, Lava and Kusa; and the names of the tappas or revenue subdivisions are, with few exceptions, connected with Hindu sages. The District was included in the kingdom of Mithila, which may have been a great seat of Sanskrit learning as early as 1000 B.C. To this period General Cunningham assigns the three rows of huge conical mounds at Lauriy\u0101 Nandangarh; and there are interesting ruins at Arar\u0101j and Kesariya, while a fine specimen of an Asoka pillar stands at Lauriy\u0101 Nandangarh, and another Asoka pillar, known as the R\u0101mpurw\u0101 pillar, lies prone at Pipariya. After the decay of Buddhism a powerful Hindu dynasty seems to have ruled from 1097 to 1322 at Simraun, in Nep\u0101l, where extensive remains still exist. It was founded by N\u0101nya Deva, who was followed by six of his line; the last was conquered by Hari Singh Deva, who had been driven out of Ajodhy\u0101 by the Muhammadsans. His dynasty preserved its independence for more than a century later than South Bih\u0101r, which was conquered by Muhammad-i-Bakhty\u0101r Khilji in 1197.\n\nIn 1765 the District passed, with the rest of Bengal, under the administration of the East India Company. It was treated as part of the neighbouring District of S\u0101ran until 1866. In recent times the only event of importance has been the mutiny of the small garrison at Sagauli in 1857.\n\nThe recorded population of the present area increased from 1,440,815 in 1872 to 1,721,608 in 1881 and to 1,859,465 in 1891, but fell to 1,790,463 in 1901. The first six years of the last decade were lean years, and they culminated in the famine of 1897; no deaths occurred from starvation, but the fecundity of the people was diminished. Outbreaks of cholera were frequent during the decade, and fever was also very prevalent. Immigration received a severe check, and not only did new settlers cease to arrive, but many of the old immigrants returned to their homes. The climate of Champ\u0101ran is the worst in Bih\u0101r, especially in the submontane tract of the Bagah\u0101 and Shik\u0101rpur th\u0101nas. In the whole District malarial fevers and cholera are the principal diseases. Goitre is prevalent in the neighbourhood of the Chanchawat and Dhanauti rivers; and the proportion of deaf-mutes (2\u00b775 per 1,000 among males) exceeds that of any other Bengal District. The principal statistics of the Census of 1901 are shown in the table on next page.\n\nThe population is sparse in comparison with the neighbouring\nDistricts, the density being only 507 persons per square mile, as compared with 901 in S\u0101ran and 908 in Muzaffarpur. The most thickly populated th\u0101nas are Madhuban (810), Dh\u0101ka (771), and Ad\u0101pur (749), in the east of the District, where the conditions are similar to those in Muzaffarpur; but in the north-western th\u0101nas of Shik\u0101rpur and Bagah\u0101, where cultivation is yet undeveloped and malaria is very prevalent, there are only 270 and 301 persons respectively per square mile. The population is almost entirely rural, the only towns being Bettiah (24,696) and Motih\u0101r\u012b, the head-quarters. Immigration to the half-reclaimed country in the north of the District formerly took place on a large scale from Gorakhpur, S\u0101ran, and Muzaffarpur, and also from Nep\u0101l. The language spoken is the Bhojpuri dialect of Bih\u0101r\u012b; but Muhammadans and K\u0101yasths mostly talk Awadh\u012b, and the Th\u0101rus have a dialect of their own, which is a mixture of Maithill and Bhojpuri known as Madesi. The character officially and generally used for writing is Kaith\u012b. Hindus number 1,523,949, or 85 per cent. of the total, and Muhammadans 264,686, or nearly 15 per cent.; the latter are considerably more numerous in Champ\u0101ran than in any other Bih\u0101r District except Purnea.\n\n| Subdivision | Area in square miles | Number of Towns | Villages | Population | Population per square mile | Percentage of variation in population between 1891 and 1901 | Number of persons able to read and write |\n|-------------|---------------------|----------------|----------|------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Motih\u0101r\u012b     | 1,518               | 1              | 1,304    | 1,040,599  | 686                       | - 5.4                                           | 26,1545                                |\n| Bettiah     | 2,013               | 4              | 1,319    | 749,864    | 373                       | - 1.3                                           | 13,951                                 |\n| District total | 3,531             | 2              | 2,623    | 1,790,463  | 507                       | - 3.7                                           | 40,496                                 |\n\nThe most numerous castes are Ah\u012brs or herdsmen (189,000) and Cham\u0101rs or leather-dressers (125,000). There are 85,000 Br\u0101hmans, many of them imported by the Bettiah R\u0101j; 79,000 R\u0101jp\u016bts; and 52,000 B\u0101bhans. Koiris (84,000) and Kurmis (99,000) are the best cultivators; K\u0101yasths (29,000) are the literary caste; and Nuni\u0101s (55,000), the hereditary manufacturers of saltpetre, make the best labourers. Among the aboriginal population are included the Th\u0101rus (27,000), who are almost entirely confined to the two frontier th\u0101nas of Shik\u0101rpur and Bagah\u0101. These people live in scattered settlements in the malarious tarai along the foot of the Him\u0101layas, from the Kosi river in Purnea almost as far as the Ganges. Originally of nomadic habits, they appear to have settled down as honest and industrious cultivators, utilizing the water of the hill streams to irrigate their scanty patches of rice cultivation. Their religion is a veneer of Hinduism over Animism. A gipsy branch of the Magahiya sub-caste of Domis has acquired an\nevil reputation in Champ\u0101ran, as they are inveterate thieves and house-breakers, using knives and clubs to defend themselves when interfered with. Since 1882 attempts have been made to reclaim them, and they have been collected in two settlements where they have been provided with land for cultivation. Among the Muhammadans, the Jol\u0101h\u0101s (74,000) and Shaikhs (72,000) are the most numerous communities. Of 205 Europeans most are engaged in the indigo industry. Of the total population, 80 per cent. are dependent upon agriculture, and 6 per cent. on industrial avocations; 8 per cent. are classed as general labourers; while less than one per cent. are engaged in commerce.\n\nChristians number 2,417, including 2,180 native converts. They are nearly all Roman Catholics, and are to be found in the Bettiah subdivision, where two Roman Catholic missions are at work, one of them being a lineal descendant of the old Lh\u0101sa mission, which, when ejected from Tibet, retreated first to Nep\u0101l and afterwards to this District. A Protestant mission, styled 'The Regions Beyond Mission,' has been opened at Motl\u0101r\u012b.\n\nNorth of the Burh\u012b Gandak hard clay soils, locally called b\u0101ngar, predominate; these are particularly suitable for rice cultivation, but they require irrigation; where autumn rice is grown, Agriculture, it is followed by spring crops of oilseeds and pulses, but if winter rice is grown, there is no second crop. In some parts of this northern tract a thin loam is also found, which will not grow rice, but bears crops of maize, barley, gram, pulses, and oilseeds; and in others, a sandy soil fit only for maize and inferior millets. South of the Burh\u012b Gandak uplands predominate, except in the Kesariy\u0101 and Gobindganj th\u0101nas, where rice is grown in the marshes. The soil in the uplands is generally a light loam, and bears millets, pulses, wheat and barley, oilseeds, and indigo.\n\nThe chief agricultural statistics for 1903-4 are shown below, areas being in square miles:\n\n| Subdivision | Total | Cultivated | Cultivable waste | Irrigated from canals |\n|-------------|-------|------------|------------------|----------------------|\n| Motl\u0101r\u012b     | 1,518 | 1,104      | 180              | 2                    |\n| Bettiah     | 3,013 | 1,041      | 416              |                      |\n| Total       | 3,531 | 2,145      | 596              | 2                    |\n\nA conspicuous feature is the large area of cultivable waste land, chiefly in the two north-western th\u0101nas of Bagah\u0101 and Shik\u0101rpur; its reclamation is proceeding rapidly, in spite of the prevalence of malaria, which saps the energy of the cultivators.\n\nOwing to the comparatively sparse population, food-crops occupy\nonly 83 per cent. of the cultivated area. Rice, which is more generally grown than in Muzaffarpur or Saran, extends over more than half the cultivated area of the District; two-thirds of this area is occupied by the winter crop, and the rest by early rice. The extensive cultivation of the latter is remarkable, and in Adipur it actually exceeds the area under winter rice. Barley is the next food-grain of importance, followed by maize, wheat, and pulses. The non-food crops are indigo, oilseeds, thatching grass, poppy, and sugar-cane. Indigo is losing ground owing to the competition of the synthetic dye. As in other parts of Bihar, poppy is cultivated under a system of Government advances. The total area under poppy in 1903-4 was about 50,000 acres and the out-turn of opium 300 tons. Cow-dung and indigo refuse are used as manure for special crops, such as sugar-cane, tobacco, poppy, and indigo. Little advantage has been taken of the Land Improvements Act, but in the famine of 1897 a sum of 2-2 lakhs was advanced under the Agriculturists' Loans Act.\n\nThere is abundance of pasture in Bagaha and Shikarpur, which attracts great herds of cattle from the southern thanas and from adjoining Districts. Each family owns on the average three head of cattle. Goats also are numerous, and there are a few sheep, horses and ponies, mules and donkeys. Large cattle fairs are annually held at Madhuban and Bettiah.\n\nOnly 2 per cent. of the cultivated area is irrigated. The hill streams in the north afford facilities for irrigation; the water is carried along channels dug parallel with their beds, and in dry years weirs are thrown across them. A channel was dug in the famine of 1897, along which the water of the Masin stream is conducted for 20 miles; it is managed by the District officials. The Madhuban Canal, which takes off from a permanent dam in the river Tiar, is a protective canal 6-2 miles in length; it was constructed by the Madhuban zamindar and has been bought by Government, but it is not yet fully utilized. The Triveni Canal is under construction, and a small canal is also being made to carry the water of the Lallbegha river to the south of the Dhaka thana. In years of drought these streams are often dammed by the Nepalese before they reach the District. In the south irrigation wells are occasionally dug, but there is a prejudice against them, as it is supposed that loam soils once irrigated lose the capacity to retain moisture.\n\nGold is sometimes washed in minute quantities from the Gandak river, and from the Panchnad, Harha, Bhabsa, and Sonaha hill streams in the north of the District. Beds of kankar, or nodular limestone, are found in workable quantities at Ararij, and near Lauriyaj, and along the banks of the Harha river in the Bagaha thana; it is used for road-metal and for burning into lime. Saliferous earth is found in all parts of the District, and a special caste, the Nuniyas, earn a scanty livelihood by\nextracting saltpetre. Sangrampur is the head-quarters of the industry. The out-turn in 1903-4 was 30,000 maunds.\n\nThe indigenous manufactures are confined to the weaving of coarse cotton cloth, blankets and rugs, and pottery work. Sugar-refining, which was introduced from the neighbouring District of Gorakhpur, chiefly flourishes in the Bettiah subdivision; it has recently been started at Siraha factory on a large scale with modern machinery. Indigo is still the most important manufacture in the District. Colonel Hickey, the pioneer of indigo cultivation in Champaran, built a factory at Baira in 1813. The Rajpur and Tarkoli concerns were started by Messrs. Moran & Company, and in 1845 Colonel Taylor built Siraha. Sugar, however, was the prominent industry until about 1850. A peculiar feature of the indigo industry in Champaran is the permanent hold which the planters have on the land. In 1876 the Bettiah Raj was deeply involved in debt, and a sterling loan of nearly 95 lakhs was floated on the security of permanent leases of villages which were granted by the estate to indigo planters. The result is that, although a bare 6 per cent. of the cultivated area is actually sown with indigo, the planters are in the position of landlords over nearly half the District. There are 20 head factories with 48 out-works. Indigo is either cultivated by the planter through his servants under the sirat or home-farm system, or else by tenants under what is known as the asamivari system (asami means a tenant); in either case the plant is cut and carted by the planter. When the crop is grown by tenants, the planter supplies the seed and occasionally also gives advances to the tenant, which are adjusted at the end of the year. The plant when cut is fermented in masonry vats, and oxidized either by beating or by currents of steam. The dye thus precipitated is boiled and dried into cakes. In 1894, which was a bumper season, the out-turn was 19,040 cwts., valued at 65.45 lakhs; in 1903-4 it was only 10,300 cwts., valued at 20-20 lakhs. Not less than 33,000 labourers are employed daily during the manufacturing season.\n\nChamparan exports indigo, oilseeds, grain, and a little sugar, and imports salt, piece-goods, kerosene oil, coal, grain, and tobacco. The indigo and oilseeds go to Calcutta for shipment oversea, and the grain is exported to the neighbouring Bihar Districts and to the United Provinces. The imports come from Calcutta, except the grain, which is grown in the United Provinces. The main trade route to Nepal lies through Champaran, and traffic is registered on the frontier. The bulk of the trade passes through Raxaul, the terminus of the Saganli-Raxaul branch railway. The railways are the main arteries of commerce; but the Gandak and the Burhi Gandak also carry much traffic, the principal river marts being Gobindganj, Barharwa, Manpur, and\nBagah\u0101. The other trade centres are Bettiah, Motih\u0101ri, Chainpati\u0101, Ch\u0101pk\u0101hia, R\u0101mgarwa, Kesariy\u0101, and Madhuban. The traders are M\u0101rw\u0101ris, Kalw\u0101rs, and Agraharis, and to a small extent Muhammadans.\n\nThe Tirhut State Railway was opened to Bettiah in August, 1883. It is now known as the Bettiah branch of the Bengal and North-Western Railway, and connects with the East Indian Railway by a ferry across the Ganges at Mokameh; a branch from Sagauli runs to Raxaul on the Nep\u0101l frontier. Including 242 miles of village tracks, the District contains 1,303 miles of road, of which only 15 miles are metalled. The roads commercially most important are those which lead from the Nep\u0101l border to the railway and to the Gandak river. The District board has not sufficient funds to maintain the roads in good repair. Bridges are few in number, and the income from ferries is considerable.\n\nChamp\u0101ran is very liable to famine. It suffered severely in the great famine of 1770, which is said to have killed one-third of the entire population of Bengal. In 1866 the north of the District was seriously afflicted, and the relief afforded being insufficient, the mortality reached the appalling total of 50,000 persons. The next famine was in 1874, when distress was most acutely felt in the Bagah\u0101, Shik\u0101rpur, and Ad\u0101pur th\u0101nas. Relief operations were undertaken on a lavish scale; nearly 10 lakhs was spent in the District and 28,000 tons of grain were imported. There was on this occasion no mortality from starvation. In 1897 occurred the greatest famine of the century, brought about by deficient and unfavourably distributed rainfall in 1895 and 1896, and intensified by extraordinarily high prices, consequent on similar causes operating over a great part of India. The out-turn of early rice in 1896 was very poor, and there was an almost total failure of the winter rice crop. The most seriously affected parts were the R\u0101mnagar and Shik\u0101rpur th\u0101nas, where both crops failed completely. Relief works were started in November, 1896. The Government expenditure amounted to nearly 25 lakhs, of which over one-half was spent in wages and a quarter in gratuitous relief, while 3 lakhs was advanced as loans. The number of individuals employed, reckoned in terms of one day, was 18,000,000, or rather more than in 1874.\n\nFor administrative purposes, the District is divided into two subdivisions, with head-quarters at Motih\u0101ri and Bettiah. The Administration. revenue work at Motih\u0101ri is carried on by the Collector, assisted by 3 Assistant and Deputy-Collectors, and at Bettiah by the subdivisional officer and a Sub-Deputy-Collector.\n\nThe District and Sessions Judge, who is also Judge of Muzaffarpur,\nis assisted in the disposal of civil work by two Munsifs stationed at Moth\u0101ri. The criminal courts include those of the Sessions Judge, the District Magistrate, and the Deputy and Assistant Magistrates at Moth\u0101ri and Bettiah. Burglary and cattle-thefts are common; dacoits from Nep\u0101l occasionally make raids into the District.\n\nThe earliest settlement was made in 1582 by Todar Mal, Akbar's finance minister; but the area measured was only 148 square miles, as compared with 3,200 square miles now assessed, and the revenue fixed was 1.38 lakhs. It is noteworthy, however, that Todar Mal's revenue rate was as high as Rs. 1-6-0 per acre, or four times what it is now. The revenue was altered in 1685, and again in 1750, with the result that, when the East India Company obtained possession of the District in 1765, it slightly exceeded 2 lakhs. The revenue dwindled year by year until 1773, when it was only 1.39 lakhs; but in 1791 the Decennial Settlement raised it to 3.51 lakhs, and two years later the District was permanently settled for 3.86 lakhs. The subsequent increase to 5.15 lakhs was due to the resumption, between 1834 and 1841, of lands held without payment of revenue under invalid titles. The current demand in 1903-4 was 5.15 lakhs, payable by 1,247 estates. This gives an incidence of only R. 0-5-6 per cultivated acre, and represents 17 per cent. of the rental of the District, and only 1.4 per cent. of the estimated value of the gross agricultural produce. The Bettiah R\u0101j, the R\u0101mnagar R\u0101j, and the Madhuban Babu own between them nearly the entire District. With the exception of seven estates paying Rs. 840, the District is permanently settled.\n\nBetween 1892 and 1899 the whole District, with the exception of a hilly tract to the north, was cadastrally surveyed on the scale of 16 inches to the mile, and a complete record-of-rights was framed. This has enormously strengthened the position of the cultivator, and has done much to protect him in the peaceful occupation of his holding, and from oppressive enhancement of his rent. The average size of a ryot's holding is 5.19 acres, the largest holdings being found in the sparsely populated tracts in the north-west. Owing to the abundance of waste land, rents are low, the average rate per acre being only Rs. 1-13-9. Ryots at fixed rates pay on the average Rs. 1-2-3, settled and occupancy ryots Rs. 1-14-1, and non-occupancy ryots Rs. 1-12-10. Produce rents are paid for only 4\u00bd per cent. of the area held by occupancy ryots, but of the area leased to non-occupancy and under-ryots 22 and 65 per cent. respectively are so held. No fewer than 86 per cent. of the ryots have a right of occupancy in their lands, and they hold 83 per cent. of the cultivated area. It has been decided by the civil courts that a ryot in Champ\u0101ran cannot transfer his occupancy right in a holding without the consent of the landlord; but in point of\nfact an unusually large number of transfers are taking place, and nearly half the purchasers are money-lenders.\n\nThe following table shows the collections of land revenue and of total revenue (principal heads only), in thousands of rupees:\n\n|                | 1882-3 | 1890-1 | 1900-1 | 1903-4 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Land revenue   | 5.13   | 5.14   | 5.17   | 5.15   |\n| Total revenue  | 8.80   | 10.31  | 10.84  | 11.14  |\n\nOutside the Motihari and Bettiah municipalities, local affairs are managed by a District board. Its income in 1903-4 was Rs. 1,55,000, including Rs. 86,000 derived from rates; and the expenditure was Rs. 1,34,000, of which Rs. 71,000 was spent on public works and Rs. 32,000 on education.\n\nThe District contains 9 police stations and 14 outposts. The police force under the District Superintendent in 1903 comprised 2 inspectors, 35 sub-inspectors, 24 head constables, 323 constables, and 48 town chaukidars; the rural police consisted of 136 daffadars and 2,405 chaukidars. A small number of chaukidars are organized into a special frontier patrol, with the object of preventing the inroads of bands of robbers from Nep\u00e1l. The District jail at Motihari has accommodation for 356 prisoners, and a subsidiary jail at Bettiah for 26.\n\nEducation is backward in Champaran; only 2.3 per cent. of the population (4.5 males and 0.1 females) could read and write in 1901. The number of pupils under instruction was 21,803 in 1892-3 and 19,785 in 1900-1. In 1903-4, 18,627 boys and 807 girls were at school, being respectively 14.0 and 0.5 per cent. of the children of school-going age. The number of educational institutions, public and private, in that year was 799, including 11 secondary, 693 primary, and 95 special schools. The expenditure on education was Rs. 86,000, of which Rs. 10,000 was met from Provincial funds, Rs. 31,000 from District funds, Rs. 1,300 from municipal funds, and Rs. 25,000 from fees. The educational institutions include a third-grade guru-training school where teachers are trained, and 16 lower primary schools for the education of aboriginal or depressed castes or tribes, 3 being for Magahiya Doms and the remainder for the benefit of the Tharus.\n\nIn 1903 the District contained 7 dispensaries, of which 3 had accommodation for 68 in-patients. The cases of 74,000 out-patients and 1,028 in-patients were treated, and 3,662 operations were performed. The expenditure was Rs. 24,000 and the income Rs. 31,000, of which Rs. 700 was derived from Government contributions, Rs. 4,000 each from Local and from municipal funds, and Rs. 17,000 from subscriptions.\nVaccination is compulsory only in the two municipal towns. Elsewhere it is very backward, and in 1903-4 only 50,000 persons, or 28.6 per 1,000 of the population, were successfully vaccinated.\n\n[Sir W. W. Hunter, Statistical Account of Bengal, vol. xiii (1877); C. J. Stevenson-Moore, Settlement Report (Calcutta, 1900).]\n\nChamp\u0101wat.\u2014Eastern tahsil of Almora District, United Provinces, comprising the arganas of Bh\u0101bar Tall\u0101 Des, D\u0101rm\u0101, Str\u0101, Askot, Sor, and K\u0101l\u012b Kumaua, and lying between 28\u00b0 57' and 30\u00b0 35' N. and 79\u00b0 51' and 81\u00b0 3' E., with an area of 2,255 square miles. Population increased from 97,968 in 1891 to 122,023 in 1901. There are 1,462 villages, but no town. The demand for land revenue in 1903-4 was Rs. 65,000, and for cesses Rs. 8,000. The tahsil extends along the K\u0101l\u012b river from the frontiers of Tibet to the thick forest in the submontane tract called the Bh\u0101bar. It thus contains the whole variety of scenery, climate, and physical aspects which are found in the District to which it belongs. One of the chief trade routes to Tibet runs from Tanakpur at the base of the hills to the Lip\u016b Lekh and D\u0101rm\u0101 passes. In 1903-4 the area under cultivation was 169 square miles, of which 14 were irrigated.\n\nCh\u0101mr\u0101jnagar T\u0101luk.\u2014South-eastern t\u0101luk of Mysore District, Mysore State, lying between 11\u00b0 40' and 12\u00b0 8' N. and 76\u00b0 43' and 77\u00b0 12' E., with an area of 487 square miles. The population in 1901 was 110,196, compared with 91,250 in 1891. The t\u0101luk contains one town, Ch\u0101mr\u0101jnagar (population, 5,793), the head-quarters; and 190 villages. The land revenue demand in 1903-4 was Rs. 1,57,000. The t\u0101luk is watered by the Honnu-hole or Suvarnavati, which flows from beyond the south border north into the Yelandur j\u0101gir. It is crossed by two dams, from which channels are taken off. Temporary dams are also made when the river is low, and many large tanks are thus fed. The whole t\u0101luk is remarkably rich and fertile, a fine well-watered level plain, stretching away north-west from the Biligiri-Rangan Hills, which form the eastern and southern boundary. The soils range from black and rich red to poor and gravelly, the latter lying in the west. Jola is the staple 'dry crop.' Mulberry is grown without irrigation in the black soil. There is no cotton and little sugar-cane. The gardens of areca-nut, coco-nut, and betel-vine on the banks of the river are very fine. Some coffee is grown under European management. The wild date-tree is very prolific, and fills all the hollows. The original elephant kheddas are in the forests to the south-east.\n\nCh\u0101mr\u0101jnagar Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the t\u0101luk of the same name in Mysore District, Mysore, situated in 11\u00b0 55' N. and 76\u00b0 56' E., 22 miles south-east of Nanjangud railway station. Population (1901), 5,973. The former name of the town was Arakott\u0101ra, and a Jain basti was built here in 1117. The present name was given in 1818 by the\nMysore R\u0101j\u0101, whose father was born here. The R\u0101j\u0101 built the large Ch\u0101mar\u0101jesvara temple and dedicated the town to his father's memory. It is a thriving place, in a fertile plain of black soil. To the east lies the populous suburb of R\u0101masamudram, near to which are the ruins of an ancient city said to be Manipur. The municipality dates from 1873. The receipts and expenditure during the ten years ending 1901 averaged Rs. 1,900 and Rs. 2,000. In 1903-4 they were Rs. 3,800 and Rs. 3,900.\n\nCh\u0101nasma.\u2014Head-quarters of the Vad\u0101vli taluka, Kadi prant, Baroda State, situated in $23^\\circ 42'$ N. and $72^\\circ 10'$ E. Population (1901), 8,183. It possesses local offices, a dispensary, a magistrate's court, and a vernacular school. The municipal board receives an annual grant of Rs. 1,700. Ch\u0101nasma is famous as containing the largest Jain temple in the Gaikwar's territory. The building, which is said to have cost 7 lakhs, is made almost entirely of Dhr\u0101ngadhra stone, profusely carved, while the interior is adorned with marble flooring.\n\nCh\u0101nda District.\u2014Southernmost District of the Central Provinces, in the N\u0101gpur Division, lying between $18^\\circ 42'$ and $20^\\circ 52'$ N. and $78^\\circ 48'$ and $81^\\circ$ E., with an area of 16,156 square miles. It is bounded on the north by the N\u0101ndgaon State and Bhand\u0101ra, N\u0101gpur, and Wardh\u0101 Districts; on the west and south-west by the Yeotmal District of Ber\u0101r and the Niz\u0101m's Dominions; and on the east by the Bastar and K\u0101nker States and Drug District. The shape of the District is an irregular triangle with its base to the north and tapering to the south, where the narrow strip of the Sironch\u0101 taluk runs down beside the God\u0101vari river. The Wardh\u0101, Pr\u0101nhita, and God\u0101vari rivers successively mark the western border, while to the north the Wunn\u0101 divides Ch\u0101nda from Wardh\u0101 District for a short distance previous to its junction with the Wardh\u0101. The western portion, between the Wardh\u0101 and Erai rivers, and a small strip along the north consist of undulating open country. East of this, to the Waingang\u0101, the surface is generally broken either by isolated hills or small ranges, large areas are covered with forest, and the soil is generally sandy. The Waingang\u0101 flows from north to south through the centre of the District to its junction with the Wardh\u0101 at Seoni, when their combined streams become the Pr\u0101nhita. The greater part of the country east of it is included in the samind\u0101ri estates, and consists of an elevated plateau stretching from north to south along the entire length of the District, from which again rise numerous ranges of hills, while dense masses of forest extend over plateau and valleys alike. As already noted, three of the chief rivers of the Province\u2014the Wardh\u0101, Waingang\u0101, and God\u0101vari\u2014are included in the drainage system of Ch\u0101nda, while the Seon\u0101th, the largest feeder of the Mah\u0101n\u0101di, rises in the north-eastern samind\u0101ris. Each of these\nstreams has numerous tributaries, the most important of those joining the Waingang\u0101 being the Andh\u0101ri, Botew\u0101hi, Deni, Garhvi, and Kobragarhi, which with the main river carry off the drainage of the central and eastern portion of the District. The chief affluents of the Wardh\u0101 are the Pengang\u0101 and Erai, while the Bandi\u0101 drains the south-eastern samind\u0101ris and joins the Indr\u0101vati. West of the Waingang\u0101 the principal hills are the Chimur, M\u016bl, and Phers\u0101garh ranges and east of it those of Surjagarh and Tip\u0101garh. The general height of the plain country is about 900 feet above sea-level in the north of the District, falling to 658 feet at Ch\u0101nda and 406 at Sironch\u0101. Except in the open country on the west and north, the whole District is thickly wooded.\n\nEast of the Waingang\u0101 gneissic rocks constitute the principal formation, granite, gneiss, and quartz being the typical rocks. To the west of that river the District is mainly occupied by rocks of the Upper Gondw\u0101na system, consisting of red clay and soft sandstone, covered by coarse, loosely-compacted sandstone and shale. Fossil remains have been found in three well-defined seams of limestone. The Wardh\u0101 valley coal-field occupies a belt of 75 miles along the Wardh\u0101 river, and an area of about 1,000 square miles.\n\nThe forest vegetation in the District is of a mixed character. Teak (Tectona grandis) is fairly general, but is not anywhere very plentiful. The principal trees are s\u0101j (Terminalia tomentosa), bij\u0101s\u0101l (Pterocarpus Marsupium), rohan (Soymida febrifuga), kaddam (Stephgyne parvifolia), haldu (Adina cordifolia), semur (Bombax malabaricum), mahu\u0101 (Bassia latifolia), dhaur\u0101 (Anogeissus latifolia), tend\u016b (Diospyros melanoxylon), gar\u0101ri (Cleistanthus collinus), and pal\u0101s (Butea frondosa). Salai (Boswellia serrata) is very abundant on the dry hills and plateaux; other trees met with are behr\u0101 or satin-wood (Chloroxylon Swietenia), reunijh\u0101 (Acacia leucophloea), baher\u0101 (Terminalia belerica), siris (Albizia odoratissima), kaikr\u0101 (Garuga pinnata), moyen (Odina Wodier), ghant or mokh\u0101 (Schrebera swietenoides), pader (Stereospermum chelonoides), anjan (Terminalia Arjuna), and nirmali (Strychnos potatorum). Near villages tamarinds and mangoes abound, and in the south of the District groves of the palmyra palm (Borassus flabellifer) occur.\n\nAlmost all the wild animals belonging to the Central Provinces occur in Ch\u0101nda District, with the probable exception of the hunting leopard. Tigers and leopards are comparatively frequent, and bears are common in parts. The bison occurs in suitable forests. The buffalo is found only in the Ahiri samind\u0101ri and part of the Ghot pargana. S\u012bmb\u0101r are fairly numerous in the forests, but spotted deer are comparatively rare. The h\u016br\u0101singh\u0101 or swamp deer is found in Ahiri in small numbers, and the mouse deer in the same forests. Antelope are decreasing in numbers in the open country on the west.\nIn the Ahiri range is found the large maroon squirrel. Wild hog are numerous, and large packs of wild dogs have been most destructive to the game. All the usual game-birds are also found, and duck and snipe visit the District in considerable numbers during the cold season.\n\nThe climate is slightly hotter than that of Nagpur, and the heat of the summer months is trying. On the whole, however, the climate is healthy, and for a rice District malaria is exceptionally rare. The autumn months are as usual the most unhealthy.\n\nThe annual rainfall averages 51 inches at Chanda town and 46 at Warorit. Failure of rainfall has been very infrequent.\n\nBhandak, a village near Chanda, was possibly the capital of the old Hindu kingdom of Vakataka, embracing the modern province of Berar and the parts of the Central Provinces south of the\n\nHistory. Narbad\u0101 and east as far as the Waingang\u0101. Inscriptions show that this kingdom existed from the fourth to the twelfth century, or until shortly after the rise into power of the Gond dynasty of Chanda. The Gonds probably became prominent between the eleventh and twelfth century on the ruins of the old Hindu kingdom. The names of nineteen kings are given as having reigned from the foundation of the dynasty to 1751. The Chanda kings are called the Ballar Sahi family after Sarja Ballar Sah, the ninth prince, who may have lived in the beginning of the fifteenth century, and who assumed this title after proceeding to Delhi. The eleventh prince, Hir Sah, built the Chanda citadel, and completed the city walls which had been founded by his predecessor. His grandson, Karn Sah, was probably the first of the line to adopt the Hindu faith. The son of this Karn Sah is mentioned in the Ain-i-Akbari as an independent prince, paying no tribute to Delhi, and having an army of 1,000 cavalry and 40,000 infantry. From the time of Akbar until the days of the Marathas, the Chanda princes seem to have been tolerably independent and powerful, for both in their own annals and in those of the Deogarh line we find them recorded as gaining an important victory over the latter rising Gond power in the middle of the seventeenth century. Probably it is to this period that may be referred the carvings of the Chanda device, a winged lion, which have lately been found on the walls of Gavilgarh, a famous hill fortress on the southern brow of the Satpura range, which was for long the stronghold of Berar. The Gond kings of Chanda are shown by their architectural achievements\u2014the 5\u00bd miles of stone walls of Chanda, its fine gates, and its regal tombs, the stone embankment and remains of the palace on the Junona tank, and other buildings\u2014to have attained a comparatively advanced degree of civilization. Their rule was peaceful and beneficent, they extended cultivation and irrigation, and under them the District attained a degree of prosperity which has perhaps not since been equalled. In 1751 the Gonds were\nousted, and the District passed under the control of the Mar\u0101th\u0101s, forming from this period a portion of the N\u0101gpur kingdom. Ch\u0101nda with Chhatt\u012bsgarh was allotted in succession to the younger brothers of two of the Bhonsla R\u0101j\u0101s, and under their wasteful and rapacious government the condition of the District greatly deteriorated. In 1817 occurred the rebellion of Appa S\u0101hib; and in support of his cause the zam\u012bnd\u0101r of Ahiri garrisoned Ch\u0101nda against the British, while an army dispatched to Appa S\u0101hib's assistance by the Peshw\u0101 of Poona reached the Wardh\u0101 river ten miles west of Ch\u0101nda. It was attacked and defeated by two British brigades at P\u0101ndharkawad\u0101 in April, 1818; and the British forces then proceeded to Ch\u0101nda and, after a few days' siege, carried the town by assault, the regular garrison falling to a man in its defence.\n\nFrom 1818 till 1830 the District was administered by British officers under Sir Richard Jenkins, and subsequently made over to Raghuji III, the last Bhonsla R\u0101j\u0101. On his death without heirs it lapsed to the British Government in 1853. During the Mutiny the two petty zam\u012bnd\u0101rs of Monumpalli and Arpalli with Ghot rebelled, and raised a mixed force of Gonds and north-country Rohillas. Two telegraph officers encamped on the Pr\u0101nhita were murdered. The disturbance was put down and the rebel zam\u012bnd\u0101rs captured, largely by the aid of Lakshm\u012b Bai, zam\u012bnd\u0101r of Ahiri. As a reward she received sixty-seven villages of their forfeited territories, comprising the Ghot pargana, which the zam\u012bnd\u0101r of Ahiri holds in ordinary proprietary right. The descendant of the old Gond ruling family still lives in Ch\u0101nda and receives a small political pension, first granted by the Mar\u0101th\u0101s and continued by the British. In 1860 the British Government obtained by cession from the Nizam six t\u0101luks on the left bank of the God\u0101vari, which were formed into the Upper God\u0101vari District of the Central Provinces. In 1874 the Upper God\u0101vari District was abolished, and four t\u0101luks became the Sironch\u0101 t\u0101k\u1e63il of Ch\u0101nda District, while the remaining two were incorporated with the Madras Presidency. It has recently been decided to transfer three of these t\u0101luks to Madras\u00b9.\n\nCh\u0101nda is rich in antiquarian remains, the most important of which are described in the articles on BH\u0100ND\u0100K, CH\u0100NDA TOWN, and M\u0100RKAND\u012a. Of the others but a bare list can be given. They include the cave temples at Bh\u0101ndak and Winjb\u0101sani, Dew\u0101la and Gh\u016bgus; the rock temple in the bed of the Wardh\u0101 below Ball\u0101lpur, which during the flood season is several fathoms under water; the ancient temples at M\u0101rkandi, Ner\u012b, Warh\u0101, Armori, Deotek, Bhat\u0101la, Bh\u0101ndak, Wair\u0101garh, W\u0101ghnak, Kesl\u0101bori, and Ghorpeth; and the forts of Wair\u0101garh, Ball\u0101lpur, Khator\u0101, and Seg\u0101on.\n\n\u00b9 This transfer had been sanctioned and the arrangements for it were under consideration at the time of writing.\nThe population of the District at the last three enumerations was as follows: (1881) 649,146, (1891) 697,610, and (1901) 601,533. Between 1881 and 1891 the rate of increase was 7\u00bd per cent.\n\nPopulation. During the last decade the population has decreased by 14\u00b76 per cent. The District had poor crops both in 1896 and in 1897, and was very severely affected by famine in 1900. The largest decreases were in the zamindaris of the Chanda and Bramhapuri tahsils, which lost 15\u00bd and 24\u00bd per cent. respectively, while the decline in the Bramhapuri tahsil outside the zamindaris was 20 per cent. In the Sironcha tahsil the jowar crop did not fail in 1897, and the people gained by the high prices prevailing for produce. The District has two towns, Chanda and Warora, and 2,584 inhabited villages. The principal statistics of population, based on the Census of 1901, are shown below:\n\n| Tahsil     | Area in square miles | Number of Towns | Villages | Population | Population per square mile | Percentage of variation in population between 1891 and 1901 | Number of persons able to read and write |\n|------------|----------------------|-----------------|----------|------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Chanda     | 1,174                | 1               | 319      | 121,040    | 103                       | - 8\u00b76                                                        | 3,046                                  |\n| Warora     | 1,282                | 1               | 406      | 134,847    | 105                       | - 6\u00b79                                                        | 3,510                                  |\n| Bramhapuri | 897                 | 1               | 340      | 115,049    | 128                       | - 20\u00b72                                                       | 2,049                                  |\n| Sironcha   | 3,095                | 1               | 421      | 55,465     | 18                        | + 7\u00b72                                                        | 788                                    |\n| Garhchiroli| 3,708                | 1               | 1,098    | 155,214    | 42                        | - 25\u00b73                                                       | 909                                    |\n| District total | 10,156            | 2               | 2,584    | 581,315    | 57                        | - 14\u00b76                                                       | 11,422                                 |\n\nThe transfer of the taluks of Nugur, Albaka, and Cherla of the Sironcha tahsil, covering an area of 593 square miles and containing 142 villages with 20,218 inhabitants, to the Madras Presidency, which was sanctioned in 1906, has been allowed for in the statistics given above. In 1905 the Ahiri zamindari was transferred to the Sironcha tahsil, and a new tahsil was formed at Garhchiroli, containing the zamindaris of the Bramhapuri tahsil and those of the Chanda tahsil except Ahiri, with a strip of non-zamindari area. The corrected District figures of area and population are 10,156 square miles and 581,315 persons. The statistics given in the remainder of this article are for the District as it stood before the transfer of territory, with the exception of those of density and number of villages. The density of population is only 57 persons per square mile, being the lowest in the Province. The open country is fairly well populated, but the large zamindari areas are for the most part covered with forest and contain very few inhabitants. About 77 per cent. of the population are Hindus and 21 per cent. Animists. Muhammadans number more than 10,000, of whom about a fourth live in Chanda and Warora. There is great diversity of language, as of caste, in the District; 63 per cent. of the population speak Marathi,\nmore than 16 per cent. Gondi, 12 per cent. Telugu, and 5 per cent. the Chhattisgarhi dialect of Eastern Hindi. The Telugu population reside principally in the Sironch\u0101 tahsil, but many persons belonging to Telugu castes are found in several large villages of the Ch\u0101nda tahsil. The speakers of Chhattisgarhi belong chiefly to the Amb\u0101garh-Chauki zamind\u0101ri in the north-east corner of the District, which adjoins N\u0101ndgaon. The Mar\u0101th\u012b speakers live all over the open country, while the forests east and south of the Waingang\u0101 are populated chiefly by Gonds.\n\nBr\u0101hmans (5,000) are the largest landholders. Kunbis (95,000) and Mar\u0101th\u0101s (1,500) together form 17 per cent. of the population. Kohlis number 7,000; but with the decay of sugar-cane cultivation and the repeated failures of rice, they have fallen into poor circumstances. Other numerous castes are Ahirs or herdsmen (17,000), and Telis or oil-pressers (32,000), both of whom are now engaged principally in cultivation. Gonds (135,000) form nearly a fourth of the whole population. The M\u0101ria Gonds are almost a separate race. They are generally tall and well built, in great contrast to the ordinary type of Gond. Their marriage is adult, and the consent of the girl is essential. Sexual licence before marriage is an ordinary custom; but after marriage husbands not infrequently murder their wives, if they discover that they have been unfaithful. In a District with so many rivers, Dhimars (31,000) or fishermen are naturally numerous, forming about 5 per cent. of the population. They are generally in poor circumstances, as also are the impure menial caste of Mehras or Mah\u0101rs (74,000), who constitute 12 per cent. The whole of the Sironch\u0101 tahsil is held by a superior proprietor of the Velam\u0101 caste, who resides at Hyder\u0101b\u0101d. About 70 per cent. of the population were returned in 1901 as dependent on agriculture.\n\nChristians number 266, of whom 204 are natives. The Church of Scotland supports a mission in Ch\u0101nda with four schools, while in Sironch\u0101 the American Methodist Mission, founded in 1893, has several schools principally for the depressed Mehra or Dher boys.\n\nBlack soil is found in the tracts adjoining the Wardh\u0101 river, and in the do\u0101b between the Wardh\u0101 and Erai comprising most of the Waror\u0101 tahsil, and north of Chimur. An alluvial belt of black soil mixed with sand also occurs on the banks of the Waingang\u0101. Elsewhere the yellow soil formed from metamorphic rock is generally prevalent. Inferior sandy and stony soils cover a large area in the zamind\u0101ris. In the Sironch\u0101 tahsil a good deal of alluvial black soil is found on the banks of the God\u0101v\u0101ri. Linseed, gram, and wheat are grown principally in the black-soil lands of the Ch\u0101nda Haveli and those adjoining the Wardh\u0101 river, while jow\u0101r is the chief crop in Sironch\u0101 and the Waror\u0101 tahsil, and rice in the centre and east of the District.\nAbout 4,851 square miles, amounting to 48 per cent. of the total area of the District, are included in the twenty zamindari estates, while 9,000 acres are held free of revenue, and 8,000 have been sold outright under the Waste Land Rules. More than 300 square miles have been allotted for settlement on the ryotwari system, of which 55 square miles are cultivated and pay a revenue of Rs. 21,000. The principal statistics of cultivation in 1903-4 are shown below, areas being in square miles:\n\n| Tahsil | Total | Cultivated | Irrigated | Cultivable waste | Forests |\n|--------|-------|------------|-----------|------------------|---------|\n| Chanda | 1,174 | 283        | 44        | 367              | 554     |\n| Waror\u0101 | 1,282 | 515        | 25        | 366              | 346     |\n| Brahmapuri | 897 | 203        | 56        | 306              | 443     |\n| Sironch\u0101 | 3,095 | 86         | 6         | 279              | 480     |\n| Garhchir\u014dl\u012b | 3,708 | 426        | 51        | 1,104            | 849     |\n| **Total** | **10,156** | **1,512** | **182** | **2,422** | **3,672** |\n\nConsiderable areas of land are at present under old and new fallows. Rice covers 355 square miles, jow\u0101r 349 square miles, linseed and til 95 square miles each, cotton 79 square miles, wheat 67 square miles, and gram 31 square miles. In recent years the acreage of the wheat crop has fallen by a half, while that of jow\u0101r has increased by the same proportion. Jow\u0101r is grown both as an autumn and spring crop, the latter predominating. Cotton is also grown both as an autumn and spring crop, the latter practice being followed in the rice country in the same manner as with jow\u0101r, the reason in both cases probably being to avoid the deleterious effect produced by a heavy rainfall. The spring cotton is said to have the stronger staple. Til has become a crop of some importance in recent years. Less than 1,000 acres are now under sugar-cane; its cultivation has decreased with the unfavourable seasons, owing to the inability of the local product to compete in price with that from Northern India. Bh\u0101ndak and the adjoining village of Chichordi contain a number of betel-vine gardens, and the leaf produced is of good quality. In the zamindaris the Gonds still practise dahya or shifting cultivation. A plot of ground is covered with brushwood, 4 to 6 inches deep. This is fired just before the rains, and, when they break, rice is scattered broadcast among the ashes. In the second year a small millet is sown, and the land is then left fallow for ten years, as the available timber fuel near it has been exhausted, and its transport from a distance is extremely laborious. Rents are paid by the 'axe' of land, which is roughly about an acre.\n\nThe area under the valuable cotton crop has nearly trebled in the last few years, while manure is now more largely applied to both rice\n\n---\n\n1 In the statistics of cultivation and cultivable waste here given, 2,994 square miles of waste land in the zamindari estates which have not been cadastrally surveyed are excluded from the total area of the District.\nand cotton. During the decade ending 1904 Rs. 92,000 was advanced under the Land Improvement Loans Act, principally for the construction of irrigation tanks, and 5\u00bd lakhs under the Agriculturists' Loans Act.\n\nAs regards the extent of irrigation Ch\u0101nda is second only to Bhand\u0101ra. In a normal year nearly 230 square miles, or 22 per cent. of the cropped area, are irrigated. In 1903-4 the area was 182 square miles. About 7,000 acres of this consist of garden crops and sugar-cane, and the remainder of rice. Irrigation is applied in the usual manner from tanks, both by percolation and by cutting an outlet in the embankment and carrying the water to the fields through mud channels. A very few of the largest tanks are provided with an inferior masonry outlet, but most of them have no sluices or permanent waste-weirs. The supply of water depends on a sufficient quantity of rainfall to fill the tanks, and in years of complete drought only a quarter of the ordinary area can be irrigated. There are nearly 6,000 tanks in the District, with a capacity of irrigating an average of 24 acres each, and about 1,600 wells, which supply an acre and a half each. The best tanks are situated in the tract north of M\u016bl, on both sides of the Nagpur road. Profitable schemes for tanks to irrigate an additional 100,000 acres at a cost of about 20 lakhs have been prepared by the Irrigation department, in addition to a number of other protective projects. A scheme for a canal in the do\u0101b between the Waingang\u0101 and Andh\u0101ri rivers has been suggested.\n\nCattle are bred all over the District in the forest tracts, the bulls being selected and kept for breeding. The bullocks used for rice cultivation are small and usually white, while in the spring-crop country large bullocks, like those of Ber\u0101r, and usually red and white or reddish brown in colour, are employed. There is a considerable difference in the price, and also in the working life of the two breeds, those used in the rice country being much cheaper, and, owing to the severity of the work, shorter-lived than the others. Buffaloes are used for the carriage of the rice plants in transplantation, but they are not much in favour. Most of the ghi produced is from buffalo's milk. Goats and sheep are kept in very large numbers, the total of sheep being greater than in any other District of the Central Provinces except Raipur. They are kept by the professional shepherd castes of Dhangars and Kuramw\u0101rs, and the manure which they afford is valuable. In Sironch\u0101 there is a special breed of large, straight-haired sheep, generally white, and sometimes reddish brown in colour. They grow to 3 feet high at the shoulder, and give 1 to 2 seers (2 to 4 lb.) of milk which is used for the manufacture of ghi. The rams are used for fighting, and matches are arranged on festivals.\n\nGovernment forests cover 2,672 square miles, or about 26 per cent. of the total area of the District. In addition, the zamind\u0101ri and\nm\u0101lguz\u0101r\u012b forests cover 3,919 square miles. The forests are well distributed, and very few villages are more than three miles from some part of them. The most important tracts are the Ahiri range, which supplies teak for export, and the Mohuril and Haveli ranges, which used to supply the Waror\u0101 colliery with pit-props, fuel, and charcoal. The ordinary species of trees found have already been described. The extensive bamboo forests west of the Waingang\u0101 seeded in 1900, but most of the seed was destroyed by an insect, so that there has been little reproduction. A considerable quantity of lac was formerly gathered; but it was recklessly taken for sale during the famine, leaving no wood for stock, and the supplies have consequently been depleted. The forest revenue in 1903-4 amounted to about 2 lakhs, of which Rs. 75,000 was realized from sales of timber and Rs. 55,000 from grazing fees.\n\nA colliery was worked by Government at Waror\u0101 in the Wardh\u0101 valley coal-field from 1871, the output of coal in 1904 being about 112,000 tons, which sold for 5.2 lakhs, while the net earnings were nearly 2 lakhs. About 1,000 persons were employed in the colliery. The coal was sold to the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, to municipalities for water-works, and to cotton-mills and ginning factories. The Waror\u0101 colliery was closed in 1906. Another coal-field exists at Bandar, about 30 miles north-east of Waror\u0101, which contains three seams with a total thickness of 38 feet. Seams have also been found at Ball\u0101lpur, six miles south of Ch\u0101nda, at Dudholi, a village near it, and at Gh\u016bgus on the Wardh\u0101 river. Test borings have been made at Ball\u0101lpur by Government, but owing to the proximity of the river difficulty has been found in sinking the pits. A prospecting licence has been granted for Dudholi. There are old copper mines at Thanw\u0101sana in the Gh\u0101tkul tract, at Govindpur near Talodhi, and at Mendh\u0101 near Rajol\u012b. Iron ores of good quality occur, the best-known localities being Dewalgaon, Gunjew\u0101hi, Loh\u0101ra, Pipalgaon, and Ratnapur. The ores at Loh\u0101ra and Pipalgaon contain 69 and 71 per cent. of iron respectively. About 1,150 tons of iron were smelted in 1904 by primitive charcoal furnaces, but the industry is not prosperous. Diamond mines formerly existed on the S\u0101tti river, a tributary of the Kobr\u0101garh near Wair\u0101garh, and gold-dust is obtained by washing in the Waingang\u0101 and Indr\u0101vati rivers. Good building stone is found in several localities, and red, yellow, and white clay at Ch\u0101nda. Limestone brought from Ber\u0101r is burned at Bh\u0101ndak, and lime is also prepared at Ratnapur near Gadbori and Nawegaon.\n\nThe tasar silkworm is bred by Dhim\u0101rs in the forests of the Wair\u0101garh and Sindew\u0101hi ranges, and silk is woven by the caste of Koskatis at Ch\u0101mursi and one or two other villages. It is principally used for turbans. Silk loin-cloths and cholis or bodices for women are\nwoven by a few houses of Patwis at Chanda with thread obtained from Bengal; they are usually red or yellow in colour. The weaving of silk-bordered cotton cloths is a considerable industry, and the products of Chanda were formerly exported over a large area. Chanda, Chimur, and Armori are the principal centres, but there are a number of weavers in all the large villages in the north of the District. The cloths are sometimes embroidered with gold and silver thread. Ordinary coarse cotton cloth is woven by large numbers of Mahars from mill-spun thread. The better class of coloured cloths are woven with thread dyed in the mills, but thread is sometimes dyed black locally with imported indigo. The inferior cloths are dyed red and blue in the ordinary manner by Chhipas and Rangaris, the principal centres being Chanda, Mul, Saoli, and Bramhapuri; but only the poorer classes wear cloths dyed by indigenous methods, as they have a peculiar odour. Gold and silver ornaments of a special pattern are made at Chanda, specimens of which were sent to the Delhi Exhibition. They are made with a base of silver, on which are fixed pieces of lacquered wood of different patterns, the surface being then covered with gold-leaf. Brass and copper vessels are made at Chanda and Neri in the Bramhapuri tahsil, and also ornaments of a mixture of three parts of brass and one of zinc, which are worn by the poorer classes. Good lacquer-work is turned out at Pomurna. Articles of bamboo are also lacquered at Chanda. Ornamental slippers are made at the same place, patterns being worked on them with silk thread. Warora has a fire-clay brick and tile factory formerly worked by Government in connexion with the colliery, and two cotton-presses and four ginning factories have been opened in the last few years.\n\nThe principal exports by rail are oilseeds, timber, hides and horns, cotton, and pulses. Rice goes chiefly by cart to Berar, Hyderab\u0101d, and Wardh\u0101. Small quantities of wheat are sometimes sent by road from the Bramhapuri tahsil to Nagpur. The oilseeds are linseed, til, castor, and mustard, while mahua oil is also an important product. Cotton has only come into prominence in the last few years. Large quantities of teak-wood are sent from Alapillai and from the northern zamindaris by road. Bamboos, gum, myrabolams, and lac are also exported from the forest near the railway. Grass and charcoal are sometimes taken from the northern zamindaris for sale in Raipur District. Sambar horns are exported for the manufacture of knife-handles. The flowers of the mahua are sent to Wardh\u0101 and Berar. Superior bricks and tiles are made in the Warora colliery, and are sold locally and also sent out of the District. Silk-bordered cloths are largely exported to Nagpur, Berar, and Hyderab\u0101d. Leather shoes and ropes are sent to Berar. Salt, sugar, thread, cotton piece-goods, metals, and kerosene oil are the principal imports. The salt used is sea-salt from Bombay. Sugar comes\nprincipally from the Mauritius, and to a less extent from Northern India. Gur, or unrefined sugar, is largely imported from Bangalore and Northern India, the trade having sprung up within the last ten years.\n\nThe Wardh\u0101-Waror\u0101 branch of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway enters the north-western corner of the District, with stations at N\u0101gri and Waror\u0101. An extension of the railway through Ch\u0101nda to the coal-mines at Ball\u0101lpur is now under construction. Nearly the whole external trade of the District passes through Waror\u0101 station, which is connected by metalled roads with Ch\u0101nda and Chimur, and by an unmetalled road with W\u016bn in Ber\u0101r. The M\u016bl and Sironch\u0101 roads are the most important routes leading from Ch\u0101nda into the interior of the District. During the rainy season some produce is carried by boat on the Waingang\u0101 between Bhand\u0101ra and Armori, and during the famine grain was brought down by boat to Garhchiroli. Considering its size, the District is not well provided with roads. The length of metalled roads is 79 miles, and of unmetalled roads 398 miles; the annual expenditure on maintenance is Rs. 54,000. The Public Works department has charge of 298 miles of road and the District council of 179. There are avenues of trees on 58 miles.\n\nPrevious to the last decade there is little record of distress in Ch\u0101nda. The District suffered in 1868\u20139, but not so severely as other parts of the Province, and little or no relief appears to have been given. From this date conditions were generally prosperous until 1891\u20132, from which year there were successive short crops until 1896\u20137, caused in three years by cloudy and rainy weather during the winter months, and in three years by premature cessation of the monsoon. The failure of 1896\u20137 was not in itself severe, as an average out-turn of half the normal was obtained from all crops, but following on the previous lean years it caused some distress. Relief was principally given by granting loans for the construction and improvement of tanks. The mortality was never excessive. In 1899\u20131900 a complete failure of crops occurred and severe famine prevailed, aggravated by epidemics of cholera and dysentery arising from the scarcity of water, and 32 per cent. of the population were at one time on relief. Several road works were undertaken; 54 new tanks were constructed, and 238 repaired or improved. The total expenditure was 44 lakhs.\n\nThe Deputy-Commissioner is aided by four Assistant or Extra-Assistant Commissioners. For administrative purposes the District is divided into five tahsils, each of which has a tahsild\u0101r and a naib-tahsild\u0101r. Owing to the extent of its forests the District has two Forest officers, both of the Imperial service.\nThe civil judicial staff consists of a District and a Subordinate Judge, and a Munsif for each of the Ch\u0101nda, Waror\u0101, and Bramhapuri tahsils. The Divisional and Sessions Judge of the Nagpur Division has jurisdiction in Ch\u0101nda. Crime and litigation are of the ordinary type.\n\nDuring the ten years previous to the commencement of British management the collections of land revenue averaged 3.34 lakhs. The practice was to give short leases for a period of three to five years, leaving the p\u0101tel or village headman from 13 to 15 per cent. of the 'assets.' Various miscellaneous taxes and transit dues realized under the Mar\u0101th\u0101s were abolished when the District became British territory. The last period of Mar\u0101th\u0101 rule, from 1830 to 1853, was characterized by reckless oppression. Many of the old hereditary headmen were dispossessed and their villages made over to Br\u0101hman officials on a reduced assessment, while in order to make up the loss of revenue every device was employed to extort increased sums from those who remained. In 1862-3, when the first regular settlement was begun, the demand had fallen to 2.65 lakhs. The revision of assessment was concluded in 1869, the term fixed being thirty, twenty, and thirteen years in different areas. The tract settled for thirteen years consisted of certain villages in the Ghot pargana. The revised revenue was fixed at 2.64 lakhs, of which Rs. 22,000 was 'assigned'; but this sum excludes Rs. 59,000 on account of samind\u0101ri estates, and the revenue of the Sironch\u0101 tahsil, which then constituted a separate District. The village headmen were made proprietors, and all tenants received occupancy rights. The Amgaon, Rajgarh, Gh\u0101tkul, and Wair\u0101garh parganas, in which the revenue had been fixed for only twenty years, were summarily settled in 1886-8. On the expiry of the thirty years' settlement, a fresh revision was undertaken in 1898, and is still in progress, its conclusion having been delayed by the famines. The collections of land and total revenue in recent years are shown below, in thousands of rupees:\n\n|                | 1880-1 | 1890-1 | 1900-1 | 1903-4 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Land revenue   | 2.78   | 3.03   | 2.19   | 3.36   |\n| Total revenue  | 6.43   | 7.82   | 5.89   | 8.65   |\n\nThe management of local affairs outside municipal areas is entrusted to a District council and four local boards, each having jurisdiction over one tahsil, while the funds raised for Sironch\u0101 are administered by the Deputy-Commissioner. The income of the District council in 1903-4 was Rs. 54,000; and the expenditure on public works was Rs. 11,000, on education Rs. 21,000, and on medical relief Rs. 5,000. Ch\u0101nda and Waror\u0101 are municipal towns.\n\nThe District Superintendent of police is usually aided by an Assistant, and has a force of 663 officers and men, including 3 mounted constables,\nbesides 1,889 village watchmen for 2,584 inhabited villages. Ch\u0101nda town has a District jail with accommodation for 148 prisoners, including 13 females, and Sironch\u0101 a subsidiary jail accommodating 53 prisoners. The daily average number of prisoners in the Ch\u0101nda jail in 1904 was 61, and in the Sironch\u0101 jail between 3 and 4.\n\nIn respect of education Ch\u0101nda stands thirteenth in the Province, about 2 per cent. of the population (3.9 males and 0.1 females) being able to read and write. The percentage of children under instruction to those of school-going age is 8. Statistics of the number of pupils under instruction are as follows: (1880-1) 3,670, (1890-1) 5,495, (1900-1) 5,278, (1903-4) 6,998, including 265 girls. The educational institutions comprise a high school at Ch\u0101nda town conducted by private individuals, 3 English middle schools, 4 vernacular middle schools, and 114 primary schools. There are four girls' schools in the District. Three schools for boys and one for girls are conducted by the Ch\u0101nda Mission. The expenditure on education in 1903-4 was Rs. 42,000, of which Rs. 38,000 was derived from Provincial and Local funds and Rs. 4,000 from fees.\n\nThe District has 14 dispensaries, with accommodation for 52 in-patients. In 1904 the number of cases treated was 91,306, of whom 506 were in-patients, and 1,498 operations were performed. The expenditure was Rs. 35,000, of which the greater part was provided from Provincial and Local funds.\n\nVaccination is not compulsory in any part of the District, but 32 per 1,000 of the population were successfully vaccinated in 1903-4.\n\n[Major Lucie Smith, Settlement Report, 1869. A District Gazetteer is being compiled.]\n\nCh\u0101nda Tahsil.\u2014Central tahsil of the District of the same name, Central Provinces. In 1901 its area was 5,058 square miles, and its population 195,385. In 1905 the constitution of the tahsil was entirely altered, the large Ahiri zamind\u0101ri estate being transferred to the Sironch\u0101 tahsil, and the remaining zamind\u0101ri estates with a tract on the east of Ch\u0101nda to the new Garhchiroli tahsil. The revised area of the Ch\u0101nda tahsil is 1,174 square miles, and its population 121,040, the density being 103 persons per square mile. The population in 1891 of the area now constituting the tahsil was 132,477. The tahsil contains one town, Ch\u0101nda (population, 17,893), the District and tahsil head-quarters; and 319 inhabited villages. Excluding 554 square miles of Government forest, 59 per cent. of the available area is occupied for cultivation. With the exception of a small open black-soil tract on the western border, the tahsil consists of rice country and is covered over a great part of its area with hill and forest. The land revenue demand for the new tahsil was approximately Rs. 60,000, before the revision of settlement now in progress.\nCh\u0101nda Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the District of the same name, Central Provinces, situated in $19^\\circ 57' N.$ and $78^\\circ 58' E.$, at an angle formed by the junction of the Erai and Jharpat rivers, and 28 miles from Warora, on the Great Indian Peninsula Railway. Population (1901), 17,803. The name is a corruption of Chandrapur, 'the city of the moon.' Ch\u0101nda was the capital of a Gond dynasty, whose supremacy lasted from the twelfth to the eighteenth century. The appearance of the city from without is most picturesque. Dense forest stretches to the north and east. On the south rise the blue ranges of M\u0101nikdrug, and westward opens a cultivated rolling country with distant hills. The town itself is surrounded by a continuous line of wall, five and a half miles in circuit, with crenellated parapets and broad ramparts, traced in re-entering angles and semicircular bastions. The thickness of the walls is 10 feet, and for the greater part of the circuit they are in a good state of preservation. They were built by the Gond king Hir S\u0101h, and repaired by the Mar\u0101th\u0101s. They now form an efficient protection against the floods which are not infrequently caused by the Erai river, when driven back by the swollen current of the Wardh\u0101 at their confluence. The walls are pierced by four gateways and five wickets. The most noticeable buildings in the town are some temples, and the tombs of the later Gond kings. The principal temples are those of Achal-eshwara, Mah\u0101k\u0101li, and Murlidhar. They are generally plain with pyramidal roofs in steps, the only exception being the fane of Achal-eshwara, the walls of which are covered with a multitude of small sculptured panels. The tombs are plain substantial buildings, rather heavy in appearance. Outside the walls is the large Ram\u0101la tank, from which water is brought into the town in pipes constructed under Gond rule. Along the pipes at intervals are round towers, or h\u0101thnis, at which the water can be drawn off and carried into small reservoirs. Outside the town to the south-east, and lying on the ground, is a collection of colossal figures of Hindu deities carved from the basalt rock and left lying in situ. The largest of them measures 26 by 18 by 3 feet. They are known as Rayapp\u0101's idols; and the story is that they were prepared by a wealthy Komati named Rayapp\u0101, who intended to build a gigantic temple to Siva, but died before he could complete it. The greater part of the space within the walls is vacant, and some of it is sown with crops, though suburbs have grown up outside.\n\nCh\u0101nda was constituted a municipality in 1867. The municipal receipts during the decade ending 1901 averaged Rs. 32,000. The income has largely expanded in recent years, and in 1903\u20134 amounted to Rs. 48,000, chiefly derived from octroi. The trade of the town is now much less than it was, but Ch\u0101nda is still the commercial centre of the District. It has also several hand industries, among which may be mentioned cloth-weaving of silk or of cotton with silk borders,\ndyeing, the manufacture of ornamental slippers, gold- and silver-work of a peculiar pattern, bamboo-work, and carpentering. A large annual fair is held just outside the Achaleshwara Gate in the month of April, the total attendance at which is estimated at 100,000 persons. Cattle, tobacco, and garlic are the principal articles sold. Ch\u0101nda possesses a high school, supported by private subscription, with 63 pupils, an English middle and various other schools, and two dispensaries. The Episcopal Church of Scotland has established a mission station here, and maintains three schools.\n\nChandap.\u2014Petty State in Mah\u012b K\u0101nth\u0101, Bombay.\n\nChandarnagar.\u2014French settlement near Calcutta. See Chander-\n\nNagore.\n\nChandauli.\u2014Eastern tahsil of Benares District, United Provinces, comprising the parganas of Barhw\u0101l, B\u0101r\u0101, Dh\u016bs, Mawai, Mahw\u0101ri, Majhw\u0101r, Narwan, and R\u0101lh\u016bpur, and lying east of the Ganges, between 25\u00b0 8' and 25\u00b0 32' N. and 83\u00b0 1' and 83\u00b0 33' E., with an area of 426 square miles. Population fell from 251,542 in 1891 to 237,840 in 1901. There are 703 villages and two towns, including R\u0101mnagar (population, 10,882). The demand for land revenue in 1903-4 was Rs. 2,80,000, and for cesses Rs. 64,000. The density of population, 558 persons per square mile, is the lowest in the District. On the south-east the Karamn\u0101s\u0101 forms the boundary, and its tributaries, the Godhai and Chandraprabh\u0101, carry off some of the surplus water; but the drainage generally is defective. The soil is largely clay, and rice is the chief crop. In 1903-4 the area under cultivation was 332 square miles, of which 89 were irrigated. Wells supply about two-thirds of the irrigated area, and tanks or marshes the remainder.\n\nChandausi.\u2014Town in the Bil\u0101r\u012b tahsil of Mor\u0101d\u0101b\u0101d District, United Provinces, situated in 28\u00b0 27' N. and 78\u00b0 47' E., at the junction of branches of the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway from Mor\u0101d\u0101b\u0101d and Bareilly to Aligarh. Population (1901), 25,711. Till the middle of the nineteenth century Chandausi was a mere village, but it has now become an important trading centre, largely owing to the extension of railway communications. The town is traversed by broad well-made roads, and contains a municipal hall, a police station, a munsif, and a branch of the American Methodist Mission. It has been a municipality since 1863. During the ten years ending 1901 the income and expenditure averaged Rs. 26,000. In 1903-4 the income was Rs. 33,000, chiefly from octroi (Rs. 27,000); and the expenditure was Rs. 34,000. Chandausi is an emporium for all sorts of country produce collected from the neighbourhood. Sugar is chiefly exported to the Punjab and R\u0101jput\u0101na, while grain goes to the dearest market. Cotton is sent to Calcutta and Cawnpore. Salt from R\u0101jput\u0101na and piece-goods are the chief imports. During the last few years a considerable\ntrade has arisen in hemp (saar), which is sent to Calcutta and Bombay. There were four cotton-presses and gins, employing 161 hands in 1903, and one hemp-press. A little cotton cloth is made for local use. The middle school has 191 pupils, and the municipality manages two schools and aids four others attended by 276 pupils.\n\nCh\u0101ndb\u0101li.\u2014Port in the Bhadrakh subdivision of Balasore District, Bengal, situated in 20\u00b0 47' N. and 80\u00b0 45' E., on the left bank of the Baitaran river, 8 miles west of its confluence with the Br\u0101hmani, and 20 miles from its mouth. Population (1901), 1,826. It is connected with the interior by the Matai, the Bhadrakh road, and various tidal creeks. The importance of the port has decreased owing to the opening of the Bengal-Nagpur Railway, but it still possesses a large trade, and is supervised by a Port Officer. The sole export of importance is rice; the chief imports are cotton twist, piece-goods, kerosene oil, salt, spices, and gunny-bags.\n\nChanderi.\u2014Town and old fort in the Narwar district of Gwalior State, Central India, situated in 24\u00b0 43' N. and 78\u00b0 9' E., 1,300 feet above sea-level. Population (1901), 4,093. The town and fort are most picturesquely situated in a great bay of sandstone hills, entered by narrow passes, which in former days made the place of considerable strategic importance. The whole expanse of plain enclosed by the hills is highly fertile, and contains five large lakes and numerous smaller sheets of water, the surrounding hill-sides being thickly covered with tree jungle. The old town occupies a considerable area beyond the present walls, and is full of picturesque mosques, dwelling-houses, and other buildings, most of which are, however, in a ruinous state. The houses are built of the local sandstone, and the tombs, which are exceedingly numerous, are often ornamented with fine pierced stone screens. Formerly a rich and flourishing place, the town is now on the decline.\n\nThe old fort stands 230 feet above the town. It is entered through the Kh\u016bn\u012b-darw\u0101za or 'gate of blood,' so called from the fact that criminals were executed by being hurled from the battlements above, and dashed to pieces at its foot. The only building of interest in the fort is a palace, but the ramparts are still standing, more or less complete. The fort is badly supplied with water, the principal source being the Kirat S\u0101gar, a tank at the foot of the hill, reached from above by a covered way, which at the same time formed the weak point in its defences, and materially assisted B\u0101bar in his assault upon it. Southwest of the fort a curious gateway has been made through the hill-side. The cutting is 192 feet long by 39 broad and 80 high, and in the middle a portion of rock has been left, which is hewn into the form of a gateway, with a pointed arch flanked by sloping towers. A tablet records the construction of the gate by Zam\u0101n Kh\u0101n, son of Sher\nKh\u0101n, who was governor of the fort under Ghiy\u0101s-ud-d\u012bn of M\u0101lw\u0101, in 1490.\n\nAbout nine miles distant is Old Chanderi, now a mere heap of ruins buried in jungle. When this site was deserted for the present one is not known, but such remains as exist are Muhammadan in character. The foundation of the town is invariably ascribed to the Chandels, but the name has possibly suggested this derivation.\n\nThe earliest reference to Chanderi is by Alberuni (A.D. 1030). In 1251 Ghiy\u0101s-ud-d\u012bn Balban captured the place for the emperor N\u0101sir-ud-d\u012bn. In 1438 it fell to Mahm\u016bd Khilji I of M\u0101lw\u0101, who took it after a siege of some months. In 1520 it was seized by R\u0101n\u0101 Sanga of Chitor, who made it over to Medini Rai, the revolted minister of Mahm\u016bd II of M\u0101lw\u0101. From Medini Rai it was captured by B\u0101bar after a fierce struggle, which is graphically described by that monarch in his diary. In 1540 it passed to Sher Sh\u0101h and became part of Shuj\u0101at Kh\u0101n\u2019s governorship. When M\u0101lw\u0101 fell to Akbar, Chanderi became the head-quarters of a sark\u0101r in the S\u016bbah of M\u0101lw\u0101. It was then a large place, with 14,000 stone houses and 1,200 mosques. Chanderi was taken by the Bundel\u0101s in 1586 and was held by R\u0101m S\u0101h, a son of R\u0101j\u0101 Madhukar of Orchh\u0101. In 1680 Devi Singh Bundel\u0101 was appointed governor, and the fort remained in his family until 1811, when it was taken by Jean Baptiste Filose, for Daulat Rao Sindhia. On the formation of the Gwalior Contingent in 1844, it was included in the territory assigned to the British Government for the maintenance of that force. During the Mutiny, Chanderi was captured by Sir Hugh Rose on St. Patrick\u2019s Day, 1858, after a stubborn fight. It then remained a British possession till 1861, when it was restored to Sindhia (see Jhansi District). It has long been famous for the manufacture of delicate muslins, an industry which is still carried on, but in a decaying state. The cloth is of unusual fineness and delicacy, while the coloured gold and silk borders are of surpassing beauty. A school, a State post office, a police station, and an inspection bungalow are situated in the town.\n\n[A. Cunningham, Archaeological Survey Reports, vol. ii, p. 402.]\n\nChandernagore (Chandarnagar).\u2014French settlement situated in 22\u00b0 52' N. and 88\u00b0 22' E., on the bank of the Hooghly, a short distance below Chinsura. Population (1901), about 25,000. The town was permanently occupied by the French in 1688, though previously it had been temporarily occupied by them at a date given as 1672 or 1676. It did not, however, rise to any importance till the time of Dupleix, during whose administration more than 2,000 brick houses were erected, and a considerable maritime trade was carried on. In 1757 the town was bombarded by the English fleet under Admiral Watson, together with a land force commanded by Clive, and captured, the fortifications and houses being afterwards demolished. It was restored to the French\nin 1763, but was retaken when hostilities were renewed in 1794. It was again restored by the Peace of Amiens in 1802, but was retaken in the same year and was held by the English till 1816, when it was finally restored to the French.\n\nThe former grandeur of Chandernagore has disappeared, and at present it is little more than a quiet suburban town with little external trade. The railway station on the East Indian Railway is just outside French territory, 22 miles from Calcutta (Howrah). The chief administrative officer is the Administrator, who is subordinate to the Governor of the French Possessions. On the assumption of the opium monopoly by the British, the French Government of Chandernagore obtained by the convention of 1815 the right to purchase 300 chests of opium annually at the auction sales held in Calcutta, at the average price obtained at the monthly sales. This right has, however, been commuted for the payment of an annual subsidy of Rs. 3,000 to the French Government; and a further subsidy of Rs. 2,000 a year is also paid to that Government in consideration of their undertaking to suppress the smuggling of opium from their territory into British India, or the traffic by export or import of any opium other than that purchased at the Hooghly treasury. The peculiar situation of Chandernagore affords unusual facilities for the escape of thieves and for the operations of smugglers in opium and other excisable articles. The chief public institution is the Coll\u00e8ge Dupleix, formerly called St. Mary's Institution, founded in 1882 and under the direct control of the French Administrator. There is also a bust of Dupleix in a little Square.\n\nChandipur.\u2014Village in the head-quarters subdivision of Balasore District, Bengal, situated in 21\u00b0 27' N. and 87\u00b0 2' E., on the sea-coast, about 9 miles east of Balasore town, and near the mouth of the Burhabalang river. Population (1901), 627. The Ordnance Proof department has a sea-range here where cannon are tested. The department has also a magazine and all necessary instruments at Chandipur. Since the railway has brought Balasore within easy reach of Calcutta, there has been an influx of visitors who come to enjoy the sea-breezes at Chandipur, and the place possesses possibilities as a health resort; there is a long level beach, and sea-bathing is possible owing to the absence of surf. A branch line of the Bengal-Nagpur Railway to connect Chandipur with Balasore has been projected. Large quantities of excellent fish are caught here, which are carried by coolies to Balasore and thence railed to Calcutta.\n\nChandod.\u2014Village and place of pilgrimage in the Rew\u0101 K\u0101ntha Agency, Bombay, situated in 21\u00b0 58' N. and 73\u00b0 29' E., on the right bank of the Narbad\u0101, 30 miles south-east of Baroda, and 12 miles south of Dabhoi, with which it is connected by a section of the Gaikw\u0101r's narrow-gauge Dabhoi State Railway. Population (1901), 2,613. Close\nto Ch\u0101ndod is the village of Karn\u0101li. Both these villages, with their temples and certain sacred spots on the river, are visited twice a year by more than 20,000 pilgrims. The chief occasions are the full moon of K\u0101rtik (October-November) and the full moon of Chaitra (March-April). What James Forbes wrote (Oriental Memoirs) 120 years ago is still true:\n\n'No place in the western province of Hindust\u0101n is reputed so holy as Ch\u0101ndod: none at least exceeds it; its temples and seminaries almost vie with the fane of Jagann\u0101th and the college of Benares.'\n\nThe ownership of the village vests jointly in the Gaikw\u0101r of Baroda and the M\u0101ndwa chief in Rew\u0101 K\u0101nth\u0101.\n\nCh\u0101ndor T\u0101luka (or Ch\u0101ndvad).\u2014Central t\u0101luka of N\u0101sik District, Bombay, lying between 20\u00b0 9' and 20\u00b0 24' N. and 73\u00b0 56' and 74\u00b0 29' E., with an area of 377 square miles. There are two towns, Manm\u0101d (population, 7,113) and Ch\u0101ndor (5,374), the head-quarters; and 107 villages. The population in 1901 was 55,968, compared with 51,529 in 1891. The density, 148 persons per square mile, is slightly above the District average. The demand for land revenue in 1903-4 was 1-1 lakhs, and for cesses Rs. 8,000. Except in the eastern corner, which is roughened by bare hills and which drains east to the Girn\u0101, Ch\u0101ndor is a waving plain, sloping gently down to the God\u0101vari. The Ch\u0101ndor range constitutes the northern boundary. In the centre and south the soil is a deep, rich, black alluvium, yielding heavy crops of wheat and gram. In other parts the soil is poor and shallow. The t\u0101luka is well provided with roads. The cultivators are generally in debt, but some villages show signs of material comfort.\n\nCh\u0101ndor Town (Ch\u0101ndvad).\u2014Head-quarters of the t\u0101luka of the same name in N\u0101sik District, Bombay, situated in 20\u00b0 20' N. and 74\u00b0 15' E., at the foot of a range of hills varying from 4,000 to 4,500 feet in height, 40 miles north-east of N\u0101sik town and 14 miles north of the L\u0101salgaon station on the Great Indian Peninsula Railway. Population (1901), 5,374. Before the opening of the railway there was a small manufacture of copper and brass pots and ironwork. The town contains a dispensary. Ch\u0101ndor is probably the Chandradityapur of Dridhaprah\u0101r, the founder of the Ch\u0101ndor Y\u0101dava dynasty (801-1073), who cleared it of robbers. In 1635 it was captured by the Mughals. It then passed to the Mar\u0101th\u0101s, but was retaken by Aurangzeb in 1665. It is said to have been greatly enlarged by Holkar in 1763, and remained until 1818 the private property of that chief, who started a mint here. In 1804 it was captured by Colonel Wallace, but was restored to Holkar until 1818, when it finally passed to the British. The Mahar\u0101j\u0101 had a large and once magnificent house in the centre of the town. The old fort of Ch\u0101ndor, 3,994 feet high, on the flat summit of a hill rising\nimmediately above the town, is nearly inaccessible, and commands an important gh\u0101\u1e6d or pass on the route from Kh\u0101ndesh to Bombay. Here are a temple of Renuka-dev\u012b and some Jain caves. The temple is of comparatively modern construction, but contains two interesting images of wood, lying in the inner courtyard and much daubed with red paint. They both appear to be Roman Catholic images, one representing the Annunciation and the other St. Anna with the infant Virgin on her knee, but now bear the names of Hindu goddesses and serve as such. The Jain cave which is excavated in the cliffs of the Ch\u0101ndor fort hill contains images of the T\u012brthankars or Jain hierarchs, the principal figure being that of Chandraprabha with the crescent moon beneath him. There are also figures of Ganpati and Dev\u012b, and the cave is now called after the latter.\n\nCh\u0101ndpur Subdivision.\u2014Subdivision in the south-west of Tippera District, Eastern Bengal and Assam, lying between 23\u00b0 2' and 23\u00b0 29' N. and 90\u00b0 34' and 91\u00b0 2' E., with an area of 588 square miles. The subdivision is an alluvial flat intersected in all directions by rivers and streams, which are partially affected by the tides. In 1901 the population was 483,208, compared with 371,553 in 1891. The density was 822 persons per square mile. This is the most progressive part of the District. It contains one town, Ch\u0101ndpur (9,362), the headquarters; and 1,103 villages.\n\nCh\u0101ndpur Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the subdivision of the same name in Tippera District, Eastern Bengal and Assam, and a terminus of the Assam-Bengal Railway, situated in 23\u00b0 13' N. and 90\u00b0 38' E., at the junction of the Meghn\u0101 river and a channel from the D\u0101k\u0101tia. Population (1901), 9,362. The town is growing rapidly, owing to its favourable situation for the jute traffic. Ch\u0101ndpur was constituted a municipality in 1897. In 1903-4 the income was Rs. 17,000, of which Rs. 8,000 was derived from a tax on houses and lands, and Rs. 4,000 from ferry tolls; and the expenditure was Rs. 15,000. The municipality maintains a large Pasteur filter. The town has steamer communication with Calcutta (through the Sundarbans), Goahundo, N\u0101r\u0101yanganj, Assam, and C\u0101ch\u0101r; and several jute-presses are located here.\n\nCh\u0101ndpur.\u2014Town in the District and tahsil of Bijnor, United Provinces, situated in 29\u00b0 8' N. and 78\u00b0 16' E., 21 miles south of Bijnor town. A line from Ch\u0101ndpur to Gajraula on the Mor\u0101d\u0101b\u0101d-Gh\u0101zi\u0101b\u0101d branch of the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway has been surveyed. Population (1901), 12,586. Ch\u0101ndpur was the chief town of a mah\u0101l or pargana under Akbar, but nothing more is known of its history. It was occupied by the Pind\u0101ris in 1805, and by Musalm\u0101n rebels in 1857. Up to 1894 it was the head-quarters of a separate tahsil. The town is well paved and drained, and presents a thriving appearance. It contains a dispensary and a police station, and has been\na municipality since 1866. During the ten years ending 1901 the income and expenditure averaged Rs. 7,000. In 1903-4 the income was Rs. 11,000, chiefly from octroi (Rs. 8,000); and the expenditure was Rs. 11,000. The principal manufactures are pipe-bowls and water-bottles of earthenware, and coarse cotton cloth. A middle school has 200 pupils and 12 smaller schools about 530.\n\nChandpur.\u2014An almost uninhabited village in the Lalitpur tahsil of Jhansi District, United Provinces, situated in 24\u00b0 30' N. and 78\u00b0 19' E. It is noted for its ruins of the Chandel period. A beautiful tank covered with lotus is surrounded by the remains and contains a sculptured column. Three temples stand on its embankment, another group on a peninsula which once formed an island, and others at a little distance away. There are several inscriptions, one dating from A.D. 868.\n\nChandra-Drona.\u2014Mountain range in Mysore. See BABA Budan.\n\nChandragiri (or Payaswani).\u2014River in South Kanara District, Madras. It rises in the Western Ghats on the Coorg frontier, in 12\u00b0 27' N. and 75\u00b0 40' E., and flows nearly due west across the District, entering the sea at Kasaragod. Its total length is about 60 miles, and it is navigable for twelve miles from its mouth by small boats. A large fort of the same name, picturesquely situated on the southern bank and attributed to Sivappa Naik of Bednur, commands the mouth of the river. The stream forms the boundary between the true Malayalam country on the south and the ancient Tuluva, and according to traditional custom no Nayyar woman may cross it.\n\nChandragiri Taluk.\u2014Taluk in the north of North Arcot District, Madras, lying between 13\u00b0 24' and 13\u00b0 47' N. and 78\u00b0 58' and 79\u00b0 35' E., with head-quarters at the village of the same name. Area, 548 square miles. It contains 231 villages and one town, the municipality of Tirupati (population, 15,485). Population in 1901, 113,550, compared with 114,436 in 1891. Demand for land revenue and cesses in 1903-4, Rs. 1,30,000. Chandragiri ('Moon hill') is one of the most hilly and picturesque taluks in the District. The Eastern Ghats run through the north of it and the Karvetnagar hills occupy most of the south. It may, indeed, be said to consist of hills. These are more or less bare and rocky, but enclose narrow valleys rich with alluvial soil brought down from their sides. Its physical characteristics render it a most fertile area, the scrub jungle upon the hills retaining moisture and keeping the subsoil water at a high level, and also providing abundance of leaf-manure, which the ryots are not backward in using. Some of these jungles form extensive and valuable forests.\n\nChandragiri Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the taluk of the same name in North Arcot District, Madras, situated in 13\u00b0 35' N. and 79\u00b0 19' E., on the right bank of the Swarnamukhi river. Population (1901), 4,923.\nHistorically, Chandragiri has much interest. To its fort the fallen monarchs of the great empire of Vijayanagar fled after their power had been crushed at the battle of Talikota in 1565, and here for some years they maintained a pretence of their former state. The fort is said to have been built in A.D. 1000 by Immadi Narasimha Yadava Rayalu, one of the kings who reigned at Narayanavanam in the Karvetnagar samin-dari, and to have been afterwards improved by the Vijayanagar kings. It fell in 1646 into the power of the Sultan of Golconda. In 1758 it was held by Abdul Wahhab Khan, brother of the Nawab of the Carnatic. In 1782 Haider Ali compelled the place to surrender, and it remained subject to Mysore until the Treaty of Seringapatam in 1792.\n\nThe fort is built on a huge granite rock rising about 600 feet above the surrounding country, and both from its site and fortifications must in former times have been impregnable by storm. A large space upon the southern side of the hill is enclosed by strong walls, now in ruins, surrounded by a ditch once fed by a natural spring, but now almost dry. Within the walls stand the remains of the palace of the Rajas, several small temples, the ruined mud walls of the Muhammadan palace, and some mantapams. The main building is about 150 feet long. It faces south, with an imposing and well-balanced facade of three storeys. The sky-line is pleasingly broken by Hindu terminations, resembling the tops of gopurams or towers, the largest surmounting the darbar hall. This apartment measures 21 feet square. It is surrounded by a colonnade, and rises through two storeys in such a way that the larger quantity of light comes through the upper tier of arches, which thus forms a sort of clerestory. According to local tradition, the original document granting to the East India Company the site of Fort St. George was signed here in 1639. The palace is maintained in good order by the Public Works department, and is now used as a travellers' bungalow.\n\nThe modern town of Chandragiri is neatly built and lies to the east of the hill on which stands the fort. The old town has almost disappeared, and its site has been converted into fertile fields. The surrounding country is very productive and the scenery charming. Interesting archaeological remains abound, consisting of deserted temples, great reservoirs, and finely carved mantapams or porches.\n\nChandrakona.\u2014Town in the Ghatal subdivision of Midnapore District, Bengal, situated in 22\u00b0 44' N. and 87\u00b0 32' E. The population has steadily declined from 21,311 in 1872 to 9,309 in 1901. Early in the eighteenth century the town was taken from a Hindu family by Raja Kirti Chandra Rai of Burdwan, and it has since belonged to the Burdwan Raj. It was formerly an important weaving centre, but the industry has died out. Chandrakona was constituted a municipality in 1869. The income and expenditure during the decade ending 1901-2\naveraged Rs. 4,400 and Rs. 4,300 respectively. In 1903-4 the income was Rs. 5,300, chiefly derived from a tax on persons (or property tax); and the expenditure was Rs. 4,800.\n\nChandravati.\u2014Old city in Jh\u0101law\u0101r State, R\u0101jput\u0101na. See Jh\u0101lrap\u0101tan Town.\n\nCh\u0101nd\u016br T\u0101luk.\u2014South-eastern t\u0101luk of Amraoti District, Ber\u0101r, lying between 20\u00b0 31' and 21\u00b0 13' N. and 77\u00b0 40' and 78\u00b0 18' E., with an area of 855 square miles. The population fell from 198,106 in 1891 to 192,805 in 1901; and its density, 225 persons per square mile, is the lowest in the District, the Melgh\u0101t t\u0101luk excepted. The t\u0101luk contains 307 villages and four towns, Ch\u0101nd\u016br (population, 5,700), the head-quarters, Mangr\u016bl Dastgir (6,588), Talegaon Dashasahasara (6,220), and Dattapur (5,187). Talegaon was formerly the head-quarters of the t\u0101luk, but Ch\u0101nd\u016br was selected subsequently, as being on the railway. The demand for land revenue in 1903-4 was Rs. 3,80,000, and for cesses Rs. 29,000. The t\u0101luk lies in the central valley of Ber\u0101r and in the valley of the Wardh\u0101 river, which bounds it on the east; but the uniform fertility of these two tracts is varied by the aridity of a low range of rocky hills running from Ch\u0101nd\u016br to Amraoti.\n\nCh\u0101nd\u016br Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the t\u0101luk of the same name in Amraoti District, Ber\u0101r, situated in 21\u00b0 49' N. and 78\u00b0 2' E. Population (1901), 5,700. The station on the N\u0101gpur branch of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway is 430 miles from Bombay. The town contains 5 cotton-presses and 12 ginning factories.\n\nCh\u0101nd\u016br Town.\u2014Town in the Ellichpur t\u0101luk of Amraoti District, Ber\u0101r, situated in 21\u00b0 15' N. and 77\u00b0 47' E. Population (1901), 5,208. A weekly market, which yields considerable revenue, is held here and gives to the town the name Ch\u0101nd\u016br B\u0101z\u0101r, by which it is usually known in order to distinguish it from the head-quarters of the Ch\u0101nd\u016br t\u0101luk.\n\nCh\u0101ndvad.\u2014T\u0101luka and town in N\u0101sik District, Bombay Presidency. See Ch\u0101ndor.\n\nChangan\u0101cheri.\u2014Head-quarters of the t\u0101luk of the same name in Travancore State, Madras, situated in 9\u00b0 26' N. and 76\u00b0 36' E., 38 miles north of Quilon and about the same distance from Cochin, on rising ground washed by the eastern borders of the Kuttan\u0101d delta. Population (1901), 14,264, made up of 7,317 Hindus, 1,822 Musalm\u0101ns, and 5,125 Christians. It possesses the finest Syro-Roman church on the Malabar coast. A market, the best attended in all north Travancore, is held twice a week, at which the chief trade is in rice, pepper, dry ginger, areca-nuts, and piece-goods. The town was formerly the capital of the Tekkumk\u016br principality; it was taken by R\u0101ma Ayyan Dalawa, minister of Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101 M\u0101rt\u0101nda Varma, in 1750, and annexed to Travancore.\n\nCh\u0101ng Bhak\u0101r.\u2014Tributary State in the Central Provinces, lying\nbetween $23^\\circ 29'$ and $23^\\circ 55'$ N. and $81^\\circ 35'$ and $82^\\circ 21'$ E., with an area of 904 square miles. Till 1905 it was included in the Chot\u0101 Nagpur States of Bengal. It is situated at the extreme western point of the Chot\u0101 Nagpur Division of Bengal, projecting like a spur into the territory of the Central India State of Rewah, which bounds it on the north, west, and south. On the east it is bounded by Kore\u0101 State, of which it was formerly a dependency. The general aspect of Ch\u0101ng Bhak\u0101r is that of a dense and tangled mass of hills, ravines, and plateaux, covered with s\u0101l jungle (*Shorea robusta*) and dotted at long intervals with small villages. The most prominent of the hill ranges takes a serpentine sweep from the north-east to the south-west, and rises in occasional peaks to more than 3,000 feet above sea-level. The scenery of the interior of the country is for the most part monotonous. Hill after hill repeats the same general outline, and is clothed with the same sombre masses of s\u0101l foliage. Portions, however, of both the northern and southern frontiers rise into bold cliffs above the undulating table-land of Rewah, and seem to present an almost inaccessible barrier to a hostile advance. The highest peak is Murergarh (3,027 feet), and 32 others rise to a height of over 2,000 feet. The only rivers are the Ban\u0101s, Bapti, and Neur, which rise in the range of hills which separates Ch\u0101ng Bhak\u0101r from Kore\u0101. The Ban\u0101s runs west into Rewah and the Neur takes a north-easterly course into the same State; but both are mere hill streams with rocky beds and frequent rapids. Tigers, bears, leopards, and many kinds of deer abound. The ravages of wild elephants were at one time so serious as to cause the entire abandonment of village sites till a large number were captured. Notwithstanding the strong natural defences which the nature of the country affords, the State suffered so much in former days from Mar\u0101th\u0101 and Pind\u0101ri inroads that the chief granted eight of his frontier villages to influential R\u0101jputs of Rewah to secure their co-operation against the marauders. The chief is connected with the Kore\u0101 family, and when the State first came under the authority of the British Government in 1819, it was included in the agreement ratified with the chief of Kore\u0101; in 1848 it was separately settled. The residence of the present chief, Bhaiya Mah\u0101b\u012br Singh, is at Bharatpur. Extensive rock-cut excavations exist near Harchoka, and there are remains of old temples at Chataonda and near Bhagw\u0101npur.\n\nThe population increased from 18,526 in 1891 to 19,548 in 1901, but the density is only 22 persons to the square mile. There are altogether 117 villages. All but 32 of the inhabitants described themselves at the Census as Hindus, but they consist almost entirely of Dravidian aborigines, the most numerous tribes being the Gonds (6,000) and Hos (5,000). Most of them depend on agriculture for their livelihood; they are generally poor, and their crops barely suffice for the\nactual requirements of their families. The State contains an enormous area of sal forest; but little of the timber is of any size, and much has been destroyed, owing to a forest lease having been granted by the chief to some Bengali contractors on very inadequate terms and without any restriction as to the kind and size of trees to be felled. The country is very wild and no regular commerce is carried on, but the traders of Rewah from time to time import sugar, molasses, spices, salt, and cloth for local consumption. Two hill passes lead into Ch\u0101\u1e45g Bhak\u0101r from the north\u2014one near Harchoka and the other at K\u0101m\u0101rji. From these points two jungle roads meet at Ber\u012bs\u012b in the centre of the State. Thence they diverge again, one leaving Ch\u0101\u1e45g Bhak\u0101r by the main pass of Tiloti on the west, while the other turns to the south by way of Bargaon.\n\nThe relations of the chief with the British Government are regulated by a sanad granted in 1899, and reissued in 1905 with a few verbal changes due to the transfer of the State to the Central Provinces. Under this sanad the chief was formally recognized and permitted to administer his territory subject to prescribed conditions, and the tribute was fixed for a further period of twenty years, at the end of which it is liable to revision. The chief is under the general control of the Commissioner of Chhattisgarh as regards all important matters of administration, including the settlement and collection of land revenue, the imposition of taxes, the administration of justice, arrangements connected with excise, salt, and opium, and disputes in which other States are concerned. He cannot levy import and export duties or transit dues, unless they are specially authorized by the Chief Commissioner; and he has no right to the produce of gold, silver, diamond, or coal mines in the State or to any minerals underground, which are the property of the British Government. He is permitted to levy rents and certain other customary dues from his subjects, and is empowered to pass sentences of imprisonment up to five years and of fine to the extent of Rs. 200; but sentences of imprisonment for more than two years and of fine exceeding Rs. 50 require the confirmation of the Commissioner. Heinous offences calling for heavier punishment are dealt with by the Political Agent, Chhattisgarh Feudatories, who exercises the powers of a District Magistrate and Assistant Sessions Judge; the Commissioner occupies the position of a Sessions Court in respect of such cases, while the functions of a High Court are performed by the Chief Commissioner.\n\nThe total revenue of the State in 1904\u20135 was Rs. 13,000, of which Rs. 1,770 was derived from land. The expenditure also amounted to Rs. 13,000, including Rs. 2,600 spent on administration and Rs. 2,200 on granary establishment. The tribute payable to the British Government is Rs. 387. The samindars hold immediately under the chief and pay annual rents, which in most cases are fixed per-\nmanently, besides certain cesses. The cultivators have no permanent rights in their land, but are allowed to hold it as long as they pay their rents and cesses regularly and render the customary service (beg\u0101r) to the State. There is a small police force of 4 officers and 7 men; but in addition to the salaried members of this force there are village chaukid\u0101rs and gorais, who are remunerated in kind or hold grants of land. The State contains a small jail with accommodation for 10 prisoners, in which prisoners sentenced to two years' imprisonment or less are confined; those incarcerated for longer periods are sent to a British jail. Education is very backward, only 47 of the whole population being able to read and write in 1901; one school has, however, been opened recently. The State contains no dispensary; 730 persons were successfully vaccinated in 1904-5.\n\nCh\u0101ngla Gali.\u2014Small hill station in the Abbott\u0101b\u0101d tahsil of Haz\u0101ra District, North-West Frontier Province, situated in 34\u00b0 0' N. and 73\u00b0 23' E., on the road from Murree to Abbott\u0101b\u0101d. It is the head-quarters of the Northern Command School of Musketry.\n\nChannagiri.\u2014Eastern taluk of Shimoga District, Mysore, lying between 13\u00b0 48' and 14\u00b0 20' N. and 75\u00b0 44' and 76\u00b0 4' E., with an area of 465 square miles. The population in 1901 was 81,453, compared with 74,218 in 1891. The taluk contains one town, Channagiri (population, 4,775), the head-quarters; and 244 villages. The land revenue demand in 1903-4 was Rs. 1,45,000. The centre is occupied by the large S\u016blekere tank, 40 miles round, which receives all the streams from the south, and from which the Haridr\u0101 issues to the north. The south and west are crossed by lines of hills. The rest of the taluk is open country, with extensive grazing lands, which provide pasture for a superior type of cattle. In the north is a fertile tract containing much garden and sugar-cane cultivation. The western hills are included in the Shimoga auriferous band.\n\nChannapatna Taluk.\u2014South-western taluk of Bangalore District, Mysore, containing the sub-taluk of Closepet, and lying between 12\u00b0 28' and 12\u00b0 54' N. and 77\u00b0 5' and 77\u00b0 29' E., with an area of 453 square miles. The population in 1901 was 114,627, compared with 99,294 in 1891. The taluk contains two towns, CHANNAPATNA (population, 10,425), the head-quarters, and CLOSEPET (6,099); and 267 villages. The land revenue demand in 1903-4 was Rs. 1,43,000. The north and north-west are crossed by ranges of hills, and contain much waste land, often covered with scrub jungle. The south and south-west are open, with populous villages and large tanks. The Ark\u0101vati in the east, and the Kanva in the west, both run from north to south. The former is fringed with mulberry gardens, watered by lifts from the stream; and the lower course of the latter runs through coco-nut gardens, the soil being favourable and water near the surface.\nChannapatna Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the taluk of the same name in Bangalore District, Mysore, situated in $12^\\circ 40'$ N. and $77^\\circ 12'$ E., 35 miles by rail from Bangalore city. Population (1901), 10,425. The fort, now ruinous, was probably built about 1580 by Jagadeva Raya, who made this the capital of territory yielding a revenue of 9 lakhs of pagodas, which had been bestowed on him by the Vijayanagar king for his defence of Penukonda in 1577. He was of a Telugu Banajiga family, which rose to power in the Baramahal in the fourteenth century. His successors ruled at Channapatna till 1630, when it was taken by Mysore. The town is north-east from the fort. It is celebrated for the manufacture of lacquered ware and toys, of fine steel wire for strings of musical instruments, and of glass bangles. It is the residence of a large number of Musalmans of the Labbai and Daire sects, who trade with the west coast. The municipality dates from 1870. The receipts and expenditure during the ten years ending 1901 averaged Rs. 4,700 and Rs. 4,900. In 1903-4 the income was Rs. 5,500, chiefly from taxes; and the expenditure was Rs. 6,400.\n\nChannarayan Betta.\u2014Hill in the Chik-Ballapur taluk of Kol\u00e1r District, Mysore, situated in $13^\\circ 23'$ N. and $77^\\circ 44'$ E.; one of the Nandidroog group, 4,762 feet high. The Penner rises on the west, and the Ponnaiyar on the east. There are traces of a fort on the top, and the forest on the slopes is 'reserved.' The temple of Channa Raya is in a large cave on the west side.\n\nChannarayapatna.\u2014Eastern taluk of Hassan District, Mysore, lying between $12^\\circ 46'$ and $13^\\circ 10'$ N. and $76^\\circ 16'$ and $76^\\circ 38'$ E., with an area of 415 square miles. The population in 1901 was 90,950, compared with 78,211 in 1891. The taluk contains two towns, Channarayapatna (population, 3,222), the head-quarters, and Sravana Belgola (1,926); and 396 villages. The land revenue demand in 1903-4 was Rs. 1,97,000. The Hemavati river is the boundary for a short distance on the south-west, and its tributaries form several large tanks. A high ridge runs along the north, some small streams from which flow to the Shimsha. The country is generally open and undulating. The principal heights are the peaks at Sravana Belgola. There are large pasture grounds for cattle and sheep.\n\nCh\u0101nsama.\u2014Town in the Kadi prant, Baroda State. See Ch\u0101nasma.\n\nChantapilli.\u2014Village and lighthouse in Vizagapatam District, Madras. See Santapilly.\n\nCh\u0101pra Subdivision.\u2014Head-quarters subdivision of S\u0101ran District, Bengal, occupying its south-east extremity, and lying between $25^\\circ 39'$ and $26^\\circ 14'$ N., and $84^\\circ 23'$ and $85^\\circ 12'$ E., with an area of 1,048 square miles. The subdivision is a fertile tract of rich alluvial soil, enclosed by the Gogra and Gandak rivers. The population was 972,718 in 1901, compared with 1,029,639 in 1891, the decrease being largely due to\nsevere epidemics of plague in 1900 and 1901. The density is 928 persons per square mile. There are two towns, Ch\u0101pra (population, 45,901), the head-quarters, and Revelganj (9,765); and 2,179 villages. Sonpur, at the confluence of the Ganges and Gandak, is an important railway centre and the scene of a great annual fair and bathing festival.\n\nCh\u0101pra Town.\u2014Head-quarters of S\u0101ran District, Bengal, situated in 25\u00b0 47' N. and 84\u00b0 44' E., on the north or left bank of the river Gogra, close to its junction with the Ganges. In 1901 the population was 45,901, or nearly 12,000 less than in 1891, the decrease being mainly due to a temporary exodus of the population which took place in consequence of an outbreak of plague just before the Census. Of the total, 34,862 are Hindus and 10,934 Musalm\u0101ns. The Gogra formerly flowed close by the town, but it has shifted its course a mile to the south; the river inundated the town in 1871 and again in 1890.\n\nIn the eighteenth century the French, Dutch, Portuguese, and English had factories at Ch\u0101pra; but a severe blow was dealt to the commercial prosperity of the place when it was deserted, first by the Ganges and later by the Gogra. The railway, however, now affords new facilities for trade. The principal imports are rice, kerosene oil, gunny-bags, Indian and European cotton piece-goods and twist, and salt; and the principal exports are saltpetre, opium, linseed, gur (raw sugar), and shellac. Ch\u0101pra is the head-quarters of a troop of the Bih\u0101r Light Horse, and of a detachment of the Bengal and North-Western Railway Volunteers.\n\nThe town has in recent years suffered severely from plague, which made its first appearance in March, 1900. It disappeared at the end of May, but again broke out in epidemic form later in the year; and during the months of October, 1900, to March, 1901, 1,984 deaths were reported. A serious panic ensued, trade was dislocated, and thousands of people left the town. In 1902 a less serious outbreak occurred, and again during the winter of 1902\u20133 there was another very severe epidemic, 2,138 deaths being recorded between November and February.\n\nCh\u0101pra was constituted a municipality in 1864. The income during the decade ending 1901\u20132 averaged Rs. 44,000, and the expenditure Rs. 41,000. In 1903\u20134 the income was Rs. 59,000, including Rs. 30,000 derived from a tax on houses and lands; and the expenditure was Rs. 50,000. The main drains are flushed and some of the public tanks filled by the flood-water of the Gogra, which is admitted through the Sahibganj sluice. A fine sari is under the management of the municipal commissioners, who also own two municipal markets and a dispensary. The District jail has accommodation for 305 prisoners; a large building is occupied by the Government English school; and there are also two private high schools. Ch\u0101pra is the head-quarters\nof the German Evangelical Lutheran Mission, and a Roman Catholic mission has recently been started.\n\n**Chardu\u0101r.**\u2014A Forest Reserve in Darrang District, Eastern Bengal and Assam, situated in $26^\\circ 55' N.$ and $92^\\circ 45' E.$, at the foot of the Ak\u0101 Hills. The Reserve has an area of 121 square miles, and is best known as including an artificial plantation of the rubber tree (*Ficus elastica*), which in 1903\u20134 covered 2,872 acres. The plantation was first started in 1873 and cost more than 2 lakhs up to 1904. Tapping was first begun on a considerable scale in 1899, and the receipts under this head in 1903\u20134 amounted to Rs. 15,700.\n\n**Chari.**\u2014Village in Kangra District, Punjab, situated in $32^\\circ 8' N.$ and $76^\\circ 27' E.$ Population (1901), 2,597. In 1854 the foundations of a temple with an inscribed pedestal (since lost) were discovered here. The inscription contained the formula of the Buddhist faith, and from the figures of seven boars carved on the front of the pedestal it appeared that the statue to which it belonged was that of the Tantric goddess Vajra-var\u0101hi.\n\n*[Archaeological Survey Reports, vol. v, p. 177.]*\n\n**Ch\u0101rik\u0101r.**\u2014Town in Afghanistan, situated in $35^\\circ 3' N.$ and $69^\\circ 10' E.$, at the mouth of the Ghorband valley, about 40 miles north of K\u0101bul; 5,260 feet above the sea. Ch\u0101rik\u0101r is the residence of the governor of Kohist\u0101n, a sub-province of K\u0101bul. It is here that customs are levied on trade going to Turkist\u0101n, and the town contains about 900 houses of T\u0101jiks. Iron ore is brought to Ch\u0101rik\u0101r in great quantities from the Ghorband mines, and is worked up for the K\u0101bul market. There are several mud forts in the town and more in the immediate neighbourhood. In 1839 Ch\u0101rik\u0101r was the seat of a British Political Agent, Major Eldred Pottinger, and the station of Sh\u0101h Shuj\u0101's Gurkha regiment. In 1841 the Kohist\u0101nis attacked it and the greater part of the garrison was destroyed, Pottinger, one other British officer, and one Gurkha alone reaching K\u0101bul, though many were afterwards saved on the advance of General Pollock's army.\n\n**Charkha.**\u2014Petty State in K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r, Bombay.\n\n**Charkh\u0101ri State.**\u2014A *s\u0101mad* State in Central India, under the Bundelkhand Political Agency. The territory is much broken up, but the main portion lies between $25^\\circ 21'$ and $25^\\circ 35' N.$ and $79^\\circ 39'$ and $79^\\circ 56' E.$ The State includes nine separate tracts, comprising an area of about 745 square miles; eight of these are enclosed by the British District of Ham\u012brpur, while the ninth, which is the largest, lies on the Dhasan river, and is surrounded by portions of the Orchh\u0101, Chhatarpur, and Bij\u0101war States. The only rivers of importance are the Ken and Dh\u0101san.\n\nThe State lies almost wholly in the alluvial tract which conceals the Bundelkhand gneiss on either side of the Ken river. Some of the\noutlying portions, situated on the high land which intervenes between the Bindh\u0101chal and Pann\u0101 ranges, border on the diamond-bearing tracts, a few not very productive mines being worked in the R\u0101n\u012bpur pargana. The climate, though hotter than that of M\u0101lw\u0101, is not oppressive. The annual rainfall averages 43 inches.\n\nThe formation of the State dates from 1765. Chhatars\u0101l, the Pann\u0101 chief, in 1731 divided his territory into several portions. One of these, with an annual income of 31 lakhs, with its capital at Jaitpur, was assigned to his third son, Jagat R\u0101j. At the death of Jagat R\u0101j in 1757, a dispute arose as to the succession. Kirat Singh, the third son, who had been nominated as heir, predeceased his father, and his son Guman Singh attempted to seize the State. Pah\u0101r Singh, another son of Jagat R\u0101j, however, forced Guman Singh and his brother Khum\u0101n Singh to take refuge in the fort at Charkh\u0101ri. In 1764 Pah\u0101r Singh made terms and assigned territory to his nephews, giving B\u0101nd\u0101 (now in the United Provinces) to Guman Singh, and Charkh\u0101ri, then estimated to produce 9 lakhs of revenue, to Khum\u0101n Singh. Khum\u0101n Singh, the first R\u0101j\u0101 of Charkh\u0101ri, died in 1782, and was succeeded by his son Bijai Bikram\u0101jit Bah\u0101dur Singh, who was continually at feud with his relatives, especially with Arjun Singh of B\u0101nd\u0101, and was ultimately driven out of his State. In 1789 Bijai Bah\u0101dur Singh, in hopes of regaining his possessions, joined Ali Bah\u0101dur and Himmat Bah\u0101dur in their invasion of Bundelkhand, and, entering into engagements of fidelity and allegiance, received from Ali Bah\u0101dur in 1798 a sanad for Charkh\u0101ri fort and territory worth about 4 lakhs a year. In 1803, when the English entered Bundelkhand, Bijai Bah\u0101dur Singh was the first Bundel\u0101 chief to make terms; and a sanad confirming him in the possession of his land was granted in 1804, another sanad being given in 1811 after the settlement of a dispute regarding certain villages which had been omitted from the previous grant. He died in 1829, and was succeeded by his grandson Ratan Singh, son of his illegitimate son Ranjit Singh, whose eventual succession had been recognized in 1822, when the chief's only legitimate son died. Ratan Singh was confirmed in power, and was admitted to all the rights granted by the sanads of 1804 and 1811. Ratan Singh was the ruler during the Mutiny and loyally supported the British Government by giving asylum to Mr. Carne, Assistant Collector of Mahob\u0101l, and helping in the management of neighbouring districts. He was rewarded with a land grant in perpetuity of the value of Rs. 20,000 a year, a khilat, an hereditary salute of 11 guns, and the privilege of adoption, which was subsequently confirmed by sanad in 1862. He died in 1860, and was succeeded by his son Jai Singh Deo, a minor. In 1874 this chief obtained administrative powers; but mismanagement necessitated the appointment of a British officer as Superintendent in 1879, and the withdrawal of the chiefs\npowers in 1880. Jai Singh died soon after; and his widow adopted the present chief, Malkhan Singh, a boy nine years old, who was recognized by the British Government, the State being put under the superintendence of a special Political officer. In 1886 the special officer was withdrawn and the State replaced under the Political Agent in Bundelkhand. The Mah\u0101r\u0101ja received full powers in 1894, and manages the State personally with the assistance of his father, D\u012bw\u0101n Jhujh\u0101r Singh J\u016b Deo, C.I.E., as minister. The ruler of the State bears the titles of His Highness and Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101dh\u012braj Sip\u0101hd\u0101r-ul-mulk, and receives a salute of 11 guns. Malkhan Singh has been made a K.C.I.E.\n\nThe population of the State has been: (1881) 143,015, (1891) 143,108, and (1901) 123,254, giving a density of 166 persons per square mile. The population decreased by 13 per cent. during the last decade, owing to famine. Hindus number 118,007, or 95 per cent.; and Musalm\u0101ns, 4,842, or 4 per cent. The State contains one town, Charkh\u0101ri (population, 11,718), the capital; and 504 villages. The prevalent forms of speech are Bundelkhandi and Ban\u0101phari. The chief castes are Cham\u0101rs, 15,900; Br\u0101hmans, 14,200; Ahirs, 8,600; and Bundela Th\u0101kurs, 8,300. Agriculture supports 43 per cent. and general labour 14 per cent. of the population. About 263 square miles, or 35 per cent. of the total area, are under cultivation, of which 22 square miles are irrigable. Of the uncultivated area, 337 square miles are capable of cultivation, 40 square miles are under forest, and the rest is waste. About 66 square miles, or 24 per cent. of the cropped area, are under jow\u0101r; 64 square miles, or 24 per cent., under wheat; 49 square miles, or 15 per cent., under gram; 27 square miles, or 10 per cent., under kodon; and 21 square miles, or 9 per cent., under cotton. In R\u0101nipur a few diamond mines are worked either by the State or by private individuals. Contractors are charged a royalty of 25 per cent. on the value of all stones found, the value of the stones being fixed by an appraiser.\n\nThe metalled road between Charkh\u0101ri and Mahob\u0101 has considerably increased local trade, and a European firm has established an agency in the town. The State has a postal department, which issues its own stamps. The head office is at Charkh\u0101ri, with branch offices at the pargana head-quarters. A British combined post and telegraph office is also located at Charkh\u0101ri town.\n\nFor administrative purposes the State is divided into four parganas, each under a tahsild\u0101r: B\u0101wan-Chaur\u0101si, in which the town of Charkh\u0101ri stands; Is\u0101nagar, which lies to the west on the Dhas\u0101n river; R\u0101nipur; and Satw\u0101ra, with head-quarters at Chandia. The Mah\u0101r\u0101ja personally conducts the administration of the State. In criminal cases he exercises powers equal to a Sessions Court under the Indian Penal Code, all cases involving sentence of death, transportation,\nor imprisonment for life being submitted to the Agent to the Governor-General for confirmation. The British judicial system was partially introduced in 1863, and more completely in 1880, when the financial system was also reorganized, and a regular budget system was introduced.\n\nThe total revenue of the State amounts to about 6 lakhs, of which 4 lakhs, or 66 per cent., is derived from land revenue. The chief heads of expenditure are general administration, including the chief's establishment (1-5 lakhs), military (Rs. 89,000), and charges in respect of collection of land revenue (Rs. 37,000). The incidence of the land revenue demand is Rs. 2 per acre of cultivated area. The rates are fixed in accordance with the quality of the soil, a higher rate being levied from irrigated land.\n\nThe currency was formerly of two kinds: the Srinagar, which was coined at R\u0101th (in Hamirpur District), and R\u0101j\u0101 sh\u0101hi, struck in the mint at Charkh\u0101r\u012b. In 1864 British coin was introduced in making certain State payments, and finally in 1880 the British rupee was made the only legal tender.\n\nThe infantry force consists of regular infantry, numbering 138 men, and military police. The cavalry are divided into regulars, numbering 28 men, who form the chief's body-guard, and some irregulars. There are 24 serviceable guns and 90 gunners.\n\nThe police are of two classes: the Charkh\u0101r\u012b town police, numbering 73, and the rural police, 320, the former being regularly engaged, the latter, chaukid\u0101rs (village watchmen), taken chiefly from the semi-aboriginal Arakh, Khang\u0101r, and Basor castes. The jail is at Charkh\u0101r\u012b town.\n\nIn 1901, 1-4 per cent. of the population (2-6 males and 0-1 females) were able to read and write. The State maintains six schools with 443 pupils, the chief institution being at Charkh\u0101r\u012b town, where also a hospital and dispensary are kept up.\n\nA plane-table survey of the State was begun for revenue purposes in 1881, and the present chief is endeavouring to complete it.\n\nCharkh\u0101r\u012b Town (known locally as Mah\u0101r\u0101j nagar).\u2014Chief town of the State of the same name in Central India, situated in 25\u00b0 24' N. and 79\u00b0 46' E., 10 miles by metalled road from Mahob\u0101 station on the Jhansi-M\u0101nikpur section of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway. Population (1901), 11,718. The town is picturesquely situated at the foot of a hill called the Ranjita Pah\u0101r, which rises abruptly from the plain to a height of 300 feet. Upon it stands the fort of Mangalgarh, reached by a flight of steps cut in the hill-side. Three large lakes lie at the foot of the hill, on one of which stands the State guesthouse. The town rose in importance after 1765, when R\u0101j\u0101 Khum\u0101n Singh made it his capital; and since the opening of the railway it has become\na considerable trade centre. The chief imports are sugar, salt, cloth, and kerosene oil; the exports are grain, cotton, til, linseed, and ghi. A hospital and dispensary, schools for boys and girls, a British post and telegraph office, and a d\u0101k-bungalow are situated in the town.\n\nCharr\u0101.\u2014Village in the head-quarters subdivision of M\u0101nbh\u016bm District, Bengal, situated in 23\u00b0 25' N. and 86\u00b0 25' E., 4 miles north-east of Pur\u016blia. Population (1901), 1,532. It contains some very old stone temples, called deuls or deb\u0101layas. There were originally seven temples, but five have fallen. Some of them were Jain or Buddhistic, and numerous votive chaityas with mutilated figures either of Buddha or one of the Jain hierarchs lie in the village; but the greater number of the remains of sculptures lying about are Br\u0101hmanical. According to local tradition, these and some large tanks in the vicinity were constructed by S\u0101r\u0101ks.\n\nCh\u0101rsadda Tahsil.\u2014North-western tahsil of Pesh\u0101war District, North-West Frontier Province, lying between 34\u00b0 2' and 34\u00b0 32' N. and 71\u00b0 30' and 71\u00b0 56' E., with an area of 380 square miles. The population was 142,756 in 1901, and 132,917 in 1891. It contains three towns, Ch\u0101rsadda and Pr\u0101ng (19,354), the head-quarters, and Tangi (9,095), with 168 villages. The land revenue and cesses amounted in 1903-4 to Rs. 3,60,000. The tahsil consists of the do\u0101b and the Hashtnagar tappas or circles. The former lies between the Adizai branch of the K\u0101bul river and the Sw\u0101t, and is fertile, highly cultivated, with numerous villages, and better wooded than other parts of the District; even the uplands which run along the foot of the Mohmand hills for their whole length are now irrigated by private canals. It is mainly held by the G\u012bg\u0101ni clan and by Mohmands. The Hashtnagar tappa comprises a strip of plain country with a rich clay soil, which stretches 10 miles eastward of the Sw\u0101t, and from the Utman Khel hills on the north to the K\u0101bul river on the south. It is held by Muhammadzai Path\u0101ns, and in it lies Ch\u0101rsadda, the head-quarters of the tahsil. This tappa is intersected by the Sw\u0101t River Canal.\n\nCh\u0101rsadda Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the tahsil of the same name in Pesh\u0101war District, North-West Frontier Province, situated in 34\u00b0 9' N. and 71\u00b0 45' E., on the left bank of the Sw\u0101t river, 16 miles north-east of Pesh\u0101war city. Population (1901), including Pr\u0101ng, 19,354. A good metalled road connects the town with Nahakki on the road from Pesh\u0101war to Ab\u0101zai. By this route the distance to Pesh\u0101war is 20 miles, and the road crosses five permanent bridges of boats. Ch\u0101rsadda is a large and prosperous town, with a considerable trade, chiefly in agricultural produce, in the hands of enterprising Hindus, but Muhammadan agriculturists form the majority of the population. It has a dispensary and a vernacular middle school maintained by the District board.\nCh\u0101rsadda is contiguous to the town of Pr\u0101\u1e45g; and these two places were identified by General Cunningham with the ancient Pushkal\u0101vati, capital of the region at the time of Alexander's invasion, and transliterated as Peukelaus or Peukelaotis by the Greek historians. Its chieftain (Astes), according to Arrian, was killed in defence of one of his strongholds after a prolonged siege by Hephaestion. Ptolemy fixes its site upon the eastern bank of the Suastene or Sw\u0101t. In the seventh century A.D. Hiuen Tsiang visited the city, which he describes as being 100 li (163 miles) north-east of Pesh\u0101war. A st\u016bpa, erected over the spot where Buddha made an alms-offering of his eyes, formed the great attraction for the Buddhist pilgrim and his co-religionists. The city, however, had even then been abandoned as a political capital in favour of Purushapura, Parash\u0101wara, or Pesh\u0101war. It probably extended over a large area, and the entire neighbourhood is covered with vast ruins. Excavation was carried out in the neighbourhood of Ch\u0101rsadda for about two months in the spring of 1902-3. Some interesting finds of coins and pottery ornaments, including an engraved amethyst, were made, and the remains of the ancient B\u0101l\u0101 His\u0101r (Acropolis) were mapped.\n\nCharth\u0101wal.\u2014Town in the District and tahsil of Muzaffarnagar, United Provinces, situated in 29\u00b0 33' N. and 77\u00b0 36' E., 7 miles north-west of Muzaffarnagar town. Population (1901), 6,236. Under native rule it was the head-quarters of an \u0101mil. It is now a small agricultural town, administered under Act XX of 1856, with an income of about Rs. 1,500.\n\nCh\u0101ta.\u2014Tahsil and town in Muttra District, United Provinces.

See CHHATARPUR.\n\nChatia.\u2014Hill in the J\u0101jpur subdivision of Cuttack District, Bengal, situated in 20\u00b0 39' N. and 86\u00b0 3' E., on the trunk road near the village of the same name. On the east side of the hill are the ruins of a fort called Amr\u0101vati. The walls are made of laterite and are quadrangular, with one gate facing the east. The san\u0101na rooms are indicated by a high platform with broken pillars, and on a smaller platform stood a temple, now fallen. On one of the platforms are two well-carved life-size images of Indra and his wife Indr\u0101ni. According to local tradition, Amr\u0101vati was one of the five K\u0101takas or forts of the Kesari dynasty. On the west side of the hill is a small cave with a veranda, probably the work of Jain ascetics.\n\nChatr\u0101.\u2014Town in the head-quarters subdivision of Haz\u0101rib\u0101gh District, Bengal, and one of the principal trade centres of the District, situated in 24\u00b0 12' N. and 84\u00b0 53' E., about 36 miles north-west of Haz\u0101rib\u0101gh town. Population (1901), 10,599. On October 2, 1857, an engagement took place at Chatr\u0101 between H.M.'s 53rd Foot, sup-\nported by a detachment of Rattray's Sikhs, and the R\u0101mgarh Battalion, which had mutinied at R\u0101nch\u012b, and was marching to join the rebel zam\u012bnd\u0101r Kuar Singh at Bhojpur in Sh\u0101h\u0101b\u0101d. The mutineers, posted in great force on the brow of a hill, made a stubborn resistance, but were defeated with a loss of 40 men and all their supplies. Chatr\u0101 was constituted a municipality in 1869. The income during the decade ending 1901\u20132 averaged Rs. 6,000, and the expenditure Rs. 5,000. In 1903\u20134 the income was Rs. 6,000, mainly from a tax on persons (or property tax); and the expenditure was Rs. 5,000.\n\nChatrapur Subdivision.\u2014Subdivision of Ganj\u0101m District, Madras, consisting of the Ganj\u0101m and Purushott\u0101mpur zam\u012bnd\u0101ri tahsils.\n\nChatrapur Village.\u2014Head-quarters of the Collector, the Superintendent of police, and the Forest officer of Ganj\u0101m District, Madras, situated in 19\u00b0 22' N. and 85\u00b0 E., 13 miles north-east of Berhampur on the trunk road and on the East Coast Railway. It is an unimportant place with a population (1901) of only 4,210. Ganj\u0101m was the headquarters of the District until 1815; but in that year, owing to a deadly outbreak of fever, the Collector's office was moved to Berhampur. It remained there till 1835, when it was transferred to Chatrapur, which is prettily situated near the sea, and has a healthy climate. The school was endowed by a late Collector, Mr. A. P. Onslow, with some house property, including the house formerly occupied by the Collector. This building was afterwards purchased by Government, and a large modern residence has been erected on the site.\n\nCh\u0101tsu (or Ch\u0101ksu).\u2014Head-quarters of the tahsil of the same name in the Sawai Jaipur niz\u0101mat of the State of Jaipur, R\u0101jput\u0101na, situated in 26\u00b0 36' N. and 75\u00b0 57' E., about 2 miles from Ch\u0101tsu station on the Jaipur-Sawai M\u0101dhopur Railway and 25 miles south of Jaipur city. Population (1901), 4,902. Ch\u0101tsu is an ancient town, and, according to local tradition, was for a time the residence of Vikram\u0101ditya, the legendary founder of the Samvat era (57 B.C.), and, being surrounded by a wall of copper, got the name of T\u0101mbavati Nagari. It is said to be called Ch\u0101tsu after a R\u0101j\u0101 of the Sesodia clan of R\u0101jputs. The remains of several tanks have survived, but almost all the old temples were destroyed by the Muhammadans in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. A largely attended fair is held annually in March in honour of Sital\u0101 M\u0101t\u0101, the goddess of small-pox. The State maintains a hospital with accommodation for 4 in-patients, and there are 5 elementary schools attended by 70 boys.\n\nChaube J\u0101girs.\u2014A collection of petty sanad States in Central India, under the Political Agent in Baghelkhand, lying between 25\u00b0 5' and 25\u00b0 20' N. and 80\u00b0 45' and 80\u00b0 57' E., and bounded on the north, east, and west by B\u0101nda District, and on the south by Baraund\u0101. They comprise the five estates of P\u0101ldeo, Pahr\u0101, Taraon, Bhaisaunda,\nand K\u0101m\u1e6da-Rajaul\u0101, with an area of about 126 square miles. These estates lie partly in the diamond-bearing tract, and derive an income from the sale of the stones.\n\nThe population has been: (1881) 21,620, (1891) 23,500, and (1901) 20,711, giving a density of 165 persons per square mile. The j\u0101girs contain 69 villages. Hindus number 19,556, or 94 per cent.; Animists, 812; and Musalmans, 340.\n\nThe holders of these estates are Jijhotia Br\u0101hmans and bear the appellation of Chaube. They originally held land at D\u0101dri, a village in Bundelkhand near the Nowgong cantonment. Their aptitude for military service brought them into notice, and they rose to high rank under R\u0101j\u0101 Chhatars\u0101l of Pann\u0101. The owners of the first four are descended from R\u0101m Kishan, who was governor of the K\u0101linjar fort under R\u0101j\u0101 Hirde S\u0101h of Pann\u0101. During the disturbances which followed the invasion of Bundelkhand by Ali Bah\u0101dur, Naw\u0101b of Band\u0101, R\u0101m Kishan seized the fort, and for ten years successfully resisted all attempts on the part of the Naw\u0101b to oust him. At the time of the establishment of British supremacy, K\u0101linjar was held by the sons of R\u0101m Kishan, of whom there were originally seven. Baldeo, the eldest, being dead, his son Daryau Singh was in command. Although these men were merely revolting servants of the Pann\u0101 chief, the British Government, in pursuance of their pacificatory policy, in 1812 confirmed Daryau Singh and his brothers in their possession of the fort and adjoining territory, on condition of allegiance. Daryau Singh, however, persisted in opposing the British authority and in secretly fomenting disturbances in the country. It was, therefore, determined to dispossess him, and the fort was assaulted by Colonel Martindell on January 16, 1812. Though the assault failed, Daryau Singh agreed to surrender on condition that other lands were assigned to his family in exchange for those they then held. These terms were acceded to; but the dissensions among the different members of the family were so violent as to necessitate the grant of a separate sanad to each member, as well as to Gop\u0101l L\u0101l K\u0101yasth, who had been the family wak\u012bl. Fresh dissensions led to a further settlement in 1817. In 1862 the j\u0101gird\u0101rs received adoption sanads. It is a rule of succession among them that on the failure of heirs, real or adoptive, the j\u0101gir is divided among the surviving branches of the family. The original nine shares, created by the adjustment of 1817, were reduced to seven in 1839 and to five in 1864 by the operation of this rule, while one estate was confiscated in 1855 for the complicity of its holder in a murder.\n\nChaugh\u0101t.\u2014Village in Malabar District, Madras. See Chowgh\u0101t.\n\nChauk\u0101.\u2014A river of Oudh, being one of the branches into which the S\u0101r\u1e0d\u0101 splits up in Kheri District. Its channel now contains little water, but has a long course through Kheri, Sit\u0101pur, and B\u0101ra Banki,\njoining the Gogra near Bahr\u0101mgh\u0101t. The name is also applied to an old bed of the S\u0101rd\u0101 which now joins that river in Pilibhit.\n\n**Chaul (Cheul).**\u2014Town in the Alib\u0101g taluka of Kol\u0101ba District, Bombay, situated in 18\u00b0 34' N. and 72\u00b0 55' E., on the coast about 30 miles south of Bombay, and on the right bank of the Kundalika river, or Roha creek. Population (1901), 6,517. Chaul is a place of great antiquity. Under the names of Champ\u0101vati and Revatikshetra, local Hindu traditions trace it to the times when Krishna reigned in Gujar\u0101t. It seems probable that Chaul or Cheul is Ptolemy's (A.D. 150) headland and emporium of Symulla or Timulla; and it has a special interest, as Ptolemy mentions that he gained information about Western India from people who had come from Symulla to Alexandria. About a hundred years later (A.D. 247) it appears in the *Periplus* of the Erythraean Sea as Semulla, the first local mart south of Kalliena; and in 642 it is called Chimolo by Hiuen Tsiang. Chaul next appears under the names Saimur and Jaimur in the writings of the Arab travellers of the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth centuries. Early in the fourteenth century it is mentioned as one of the centres of Y\u0101dava power in the Konkan. The Russian traveller Athanasius Nikitin (1476) calls it Chivil. Thirty-five years later (1505) the Portuguese first appeared at Chaul. It was in Chaul harbour that a naval fight took place between the Portuguese and the Musalm\u0101ns in 1508, in which the Portuguese were defeated. In 1516 the Portuguese established a factory here, and five years later Chaul was burnt by the Bij\u0101pur fleet. The Gujar\u0101t fleet and some Turkish ships attacked it in 1528, but they were repulsed by the Portuguese and Ahmadnagar squadron. In 1529 it was plundered by the Gujar\u0101t troops. In 1594 the Portuguese gained a brilliant victory over the Ahmadnagar troops at Chaul, but in 1600 it passed to the Mughals. In 1583 the Dutch traveller Jean Hugues de Linschot described Chaul as a fortified city with a good harbour, and famous for trade. It was then a great centre of manufactures, with very deft and hard-working craftsmen, who made a great number of chests and Chinese-like cabinets, very rich and well wrought, and beds and couches lacquered in all colours. There was also a great weaving industry in cotton and silk. As late as 1668 (Bruce's *Annals*) the weavers of Chaul are mentioned as making 5,000 pieces of 'taffaties' a year. In 1740 Chaul passed to the Mar\u0101th\u0101s. The insecurity of native rule at Chaul was of great advantage to Bombay. The silk-weavers and other skilled craftsmen of the town were induced to settle in Bombay, and their descendants of several castes, coppersmiths, weavers, and carpenters, are still known as Chaulis, thus preserving the name of their old home.\n\nUpper and Lower Chaul, or, as they are more often called, Chaul and Revadanda, are among the prettiest and most interesting places in Kol\u0101ba District, and can be reached either by land from Alib\u0101g or by\nsea. The beginning of the seven miles of land journey from Alibag is made troublesome by the Alibag creek, but beyond the creek most of the way lies through shady palm groves. The Portuguese ruins in Revadanda or Lower Chaul, the Musalm\u0101n mosque, baths, and castle of Rajkot in Old or Upper Chaul, and the Buddhist caves in the south and southwest faces of the neighbouring hills, are the chief objects of interest. Chaul also contains a temple of Sri Hingalaj, in which are also images of Asapuri and Chatursringi. The temple is said to be old. The town contains two schools.\n\nChaumu.\u2014Chief town of an estate of the same name in the Sawai Jaipur nizamat of the State of Jaipur, Rajputana, situated in 27\u00b0 10' N. and 75\u00b0 44' E., about 20 miles north of Jaipur city. Population (1901), 9,300. The town, which is surrounded by a mud wall and ditch and contains a fort, is the residence of a Thakur, the premier noble of the State; he pays no tribute, but renders service with fifty horsemen. The present Thakur is a member of the State council. He maintains a small hospital with accommodation for 8 in-patients, and also an Anglo-vernacular school attended by 80 boys. The Jain community keep up a primary vernacular school attended by 25 boys, and there are 6 elementary indigenous schools, with about 180 pupils.\n\nChaungu.\u2014North-western township of Sagaing District, Upper Burma, lying along the east bank of the Chindwin, between 21\u00b0 47' and 22\u00b0 2' N. and 95\u00b0 9' and 95\u00b0 26' E., with an area of 177 square miles. The population increased from 30,108 in 1891 to 33,134 in 1901, distributed in 88 villages, the head-quarters being at Chaungu (population, 8,545), a collection of villages on the Sagaing-Alon railway, 52 miles west of Sagaing town. Good rice lands extend from the township headquarters westwards to the Chindwin, on the banks of which is Amyin, a large village with a bazar; but farther inland the country is very dry. There is no rising ground. The area cultivated in 1903-4 was 96 square miles, and the land revenue and thathameda amounted to Rs. 1,26,400.\n\nChaungzon.\u2014Township of Amherst District, Lower Burma (formerly known as Bilugyun), lying between 16\u00b0 14' and 16\u00b0 31' N. and 97\u00b0 27' and 97\u00b0 38' E., and composed wholly of the island of Bilugyun, with an area of 190 square miles. The density of population, 220 to the square mile, is high; and the area under cultivation, which includes practically the whole island with the exception of a strip of hill land running down its centre, is extensive. The population, which is largely Talaing, increased from 34,056 in 1891 to 41,880 in 1901, distributed in 68 villages, Chaungzon (population, 1,112), a village near the centre of the island, being the head-quarters. The area cultivated in 1903-4 was 115 square miles, paying Rs. 1,97,800 land revenue.\n\nChaur.\u2014Peak in Sirmur State, Punjab, situated in 30\u00b0 52' N. and 77\u00b0 32' E., and forming the highest summit among the mountains which\noccupy the sub-Himalayan tract, with an elevation of 11,982 feet above the sea. From its peculiar shape and great height it forms a conspicuous object in the landscape for many miles around, being easily recognized among the smaller ridges on every side. The Chaur presents a striking appearance from the plains of Sirhind; and the view from its summit embraces the vast lowland tract on the south, and a wide panorama of the snowy range to the northward. Though below the limit of perpetual snow, drifts remain in the shady chasms on its flanks throughout the summer months. A dense forest of deodars and other conifers clothes the northern and north-eastern declivities; and rhododendrons, ferns, and gentian grow in patches on the detritus of its granite slopes. There is an observatory on the mountain, 11,200 feet above sea-level.\n\n**Chaurasi.**\u2014Taluka in Surat District, Bombay. See Chorasi.\n\n**Chausa.**\u2014Village in the Buxar subdivision of Shahabad District, Bengal, situated in 25\u00b0 31' N. and 83\u00b0 54' E., on the East Indian Railway, close to the east bank of the Karamnasa river, 4 miles west of Buxar town. Population (1901), 1,108. It is noted as the scene of the defeat of the emperor Humayun by the Afghan Sher Shah in June, 1539. The emperor with a few friends just managed to escape by crossing the Ganges, but 8,000 Mughal troops perished in attempting to follow him.\n\n**Chautang.**\u2014River in the Ambala and Karnal Districts of the Punjab, rising in the plains a few miles south of the Saraswati, to which it runs parallel for a distance. Near Balchhapar the two rivers apparently unite in the sands, but reappear in two distinct channels farther down, the Chautang running parallel to the Jumna, and then turning westward towards Hansi and Hissar. The bed in this part of its course affords a channel for the Hissar branch of the Western Jumna Canal. Traces of the deserted waterway are visible as far as the Ghaggar, which it formerly joined some miles below Bhatnair, after a course of about 260 miles; but the stream is now entirely diverted into the canal. In former days it lost itself in the sand, like others of the smaller cis-Sutlej rivers. Some authorities consider that the Chautang was originally an artificial channel. Cultivation extends along its banks in a few isolated patches, but for the most part a fringe of dense jungle lines its course.\n\n**Chavakkad.**\u2014Village in Malabar District, Madras. See Chowghat.\n\n**Chawinda.**\u2014Village in the Zafarwal taluk of Sialkot District, Punjab, situated in 32\u00b0 22' N. and 74\u00b0 47' E. Population (1901), 5,244. It is administered as a 'notified area.'\n\n**Cheduba Island (Manauing).**\u2014An island off the coast of Arakan, in Kyaukpyu District, Lower Burma, lying between 18\u00b0 40' and 18\u00b0 56' N. and 93\u00b0 28' and 93\u00b0 46' E., with an area of 220 square miles. The island is triangular in shape; its northern coast runs east and west, its\neastern north and south, while its outward side, turned towards the Bay of Bengal, follows the general trend of the coast, namely, north-west and south-east. It is well wooded, and possesses a good deal of undulating country and some hills which rise to a height of over 1,000 feet above the sea. In the extreme north-west corner is a so-called volcano which discharges inflammable gas. The island forms a township. Its population was 23,340 in 1891, and 26,899 in 1901. Rice and tobacco are the two main items of export. The name is said to be a corruption of ch\u0101r dhuba, or 'four capes.' The town of Cheduba (population, 1,540), the township head-quarters, is on the eastern coast, near the point where the island approaches closest to the adjacent island of Ramree.\n\nCheduba Township (Burmese, Manauung).\u2014South-western township of Kyaukpyu District, Lower Burma, consisting of Cheduba Island, and lying between 18\u00b0 40' and 18\u00b0 56' N. and 93\u00b0 28' and 93\u00b0 46' E. Its head-quarters are at Cheduba (population, 1,540), in the north-east of the island. In 1901 the township contained 114 villages and 26,899 inhabitants (an increase of 1,559 since 1891). Its area is 220 square miles, and the density of population is 122 persons per square mile, which is higher than that of any other township in the District. The island has long been inhabited by people from Chittagong, and the name by which it is known to the British (said to be a corruption of ch\u0101r dhuba, or 'four capes') is of Indian origin. About 40 square miles were cultivated in 1903-4, paying Rs. 42,000 land revenue.\n\nChen\u0101b Colony.\u2014A recently settled area in the Rechna Do\u0101b, Punjab, lying between 30\u00b0 46' and 31\u00b0 46' N. and 72\u00b0 19' and 73\u00b0 38' E. The colony occupies most of the large tract of waste land owned by Government, called the Sandal B\u0101r, which was situated mainly in the old District of Jhang, but also included portions of Montgomery, Gujranw\u0101la, and Lahore. It includes the whole of the new Lyallpur District, parts of the Chiniot and Jhang tahsils of Jhang District, half of the Kh\u0101ng\u0101h Dogr\u0101n tahsil of Gujranw\u0101la, and a few estates in the Sharakpur tahsil of Lahore. In 1901 the colony had a population of 782,690, giving a density of 213.7 persons per square mile, on an area of 3,706 square miles; but since then the population has greatly increased, and the present area of the colony is 3,855 square miles. The colony contains the towns of Lyallpur, the head-quarters, S\u0101\u1e45gla, Chiniot Road, Gojra, and Toba Tek Singh, with 1,418 estates or villages. This vast area was until 1892 sparsely inhabited by nomad pastoral tribes, such as Baloch, Si\u0101ls, Chhaddars, and Kharrahs, who cannot have numbered more than 70,000 at the Census of 1891. In 1901 the Census showed that immigrants numbered 539,493, chiefly from the following Districts: Si\u0101lkot (103,000),\nAmritsar (68,000), Jullundur (57,000), Gurdaspur (44,000), Hoshiarpur (35,000), Lahore (29,000), Gujrat (25,000), Ludhiana (18,000), Shahpur (16,000), and Ferozepore (15,000). Cultivation was rendered possible only by the construction of the Chenab Canal. As fast as the canal and its distributaries were constructed, the waste lands owned by Government were divided into squares, each 27-78 acres in area, and allotted to various classes of grantees. To capitalists were allotted areas of from 6 to 20 squares each, on payment of a nazarana varying from Rs. 10 to Rs. 20 per acre according to the area of the grant, proprietary rights being eventually obtainable on a further payment of Rs. 20-10-0 per acre. Yeoman grants were made to agriculturists on similar terms, the area of a grant being usually four or five squares, and the nazarana Rs. 6 per acre. The majority of the grants made were, however, 'peasant' grants of a half to three squares each. These were free grants, but to prevent alienation, carried no rights of proprietorship, a right of occupancy being acquired after five years' compliance with the terms of the grant. Under this system capitalists have acquired 122,000 acres, including 8,500 allotted in reward grants, and 24,500 sold by auction; yeomen (including military pensioners), 142,000 acres; and immigrant peasant grantees, 948,000 acres. In addition to these, 254,800 acres have been allotted to the nomads of the Sandal Bar, and 127,000 acres to samindars of the surrounding Districts as compensatory grants. The camel-breeders of the Bar have also received 85,000 acres, on condition that they maintain camels for transport purposes, and are organized into the 59th, 60th, 61st, and 62nd Camel Corps. Four estates have been allotted to the 12th and 17th Cavalry, the 15th Lancers (Cureton's Multanis), and the 18th Tiwana Lancers, respectively, as stud farms. Since its foundation the colony has enjoyed remarkable prosperity, but its success was at first jeopardized owing to the lack of means of transport to carry off its produce to profitable markets. The Wazirabad-Khanewal branch of the North-Western Railway was accordingly constructed in 1890-1900. It traverses the whole length of the colony, within which lie 113 miles of its total length of 201 miles. Communication with Karachi is thus afforded; but the Jech Doab section from Sargodha is also being extended in the Jhelum Colony to Shorkot Road, a station on the Wazirabad-Khanewal line. It is also proposed to connect Shahdara near Lahore with Sangla; and to construct a chord-line, branching off from the Shahdara-Sangla line a short distance from Lahore, which will traverse the south-eastern portion of the colony to meet the Wazirabad-Khanewal line at Shorkot Road. Roads have been constructed in the colony to a length of 1,192 miles, of which at present only about 8 miles are metalled, though metalling is in progress on 52 miles more. For details as to the recent industrial development, as manifested in the growth of mills and factories, the\nparagraph on Arts and Manufactures in the Jhang District article and the article on S\u0101\u1e45gla should be consulted.\n\n**Chen\u0101b** (the *Acesines* of the Greeks and *Asikni* of the Vedas).\u2014A river in Kashmir and the Punjab, being one of the 'five rivers' from which the Punjab derives its name. It rises in the Himalayan canton of L\u0101hul in the Punjab in two streams: the Chandra, which issues from a large snow-bed on the south-east side of the B\u0101ra L\u0101cha at a height of 16,221 feet; and the Bh\u0101ga, which rises on the north-west slopes of the pass. The Chandra, after flowing south-east for 55 miles, sweeps round the base of the mid-Himalayas and joins the Bh\u0101ga at Tandi, after a total course of 115 miles. The course of the Bh\u0101ga to Tandi is only 65 miles, its average fall being 125 feet per mile. The united stream, now known as the Chandra-Bh\u0101ga or Chen\u0101b, flows through the P\u0101ngi valley in Chamba State and then enters the Padar district of Kashmir at an elevation of 6,000 feet. Thence for 180 miles it flows between steep cliffs of the high mountains, and then for 25 miles through the lower hills to Akhn\u016br, where it becomes navigable. There are three remarkable bends in the Chen\u0101b. Where it reaches Kishtw\u0101r from a north-west course it suddenly twists due south; at Jangalw\u0101r it tacks from south to west; and at Arnas it leaves its westerly course and flows due south past Ri\u0101si to Akhn\u016br. At each of these turns the Chen\u0101b is joined by a stream of considerable size, and at every change of course the river seems to cut through the mountain range along which it had been flowing.\n\nThe chief tributaries in its passage through Kishtw\u0101r, Bhadraw\u0101r, and Jammu are the Uniar and Shudi, and the Bhutna and M\u0101ru Wardwan rivers. Between Kishtw\u0101r and Akhn\u016br it receives the waters of the Golan Lar and Lidar Kol, and the Bichlari and Ans, and between Ri\u0101si and the western boundary of Jammu it is joined by the T\u0101wi. There are several bridges, two of which on the routes from Jammu to Kashmir, and from Kashmir to Kishtw\u0101r respectively, are of a superior description. The rest are of the primitive *jhula* type\u2014three ropes stretched across the stream in the form of a triangle.\n\nThe Chen\u0101b re-enters the Punjab at Khairi Rih\u0101l in Si\u0101lkot District. The T\u0101wi joins it almost at once, and the first place of importance in British territory is Waz\u012br\u0101b\u0101d, where the Alexandra Bridge carries the North-Western Railway across the river. Throughout its course in the plains the river flows in a wide and shifting bed of sand. A few miles south-west of Waz\u012br\u0101b\u0101d the main branch of the Lower Chen\u0101b Canal takes off at Kh\u0101nki; and thence the river flows on greatly diminished in bulk, dividing the Chaj Do\u0101b on the west from the Rechna Do\u0101b on the east until the Jhelum joins it in Jhang District at Trimmu. Thence the two rivers flow under the name of the Chen\u0101b,\ntill joined by the R\u0101vi near Sidhu and by the Sutlej at Madw\u0101la. The North-Western Railway crosses it again at Sher Sh\u0101h. Thence the united stream flows on under the name of the Panjnad, to join the Indus at Mithankot. Small boats can navigate the Chen\u0101b in the plains all the year round, but there is little traffic above Chiniot.\n\nThere is evidence to show that the Chen\u0101b flowed to the east of Mult\u0101n as late as A.D. 1245. The Be\u0101s then occupied its old bed passing Dip\u0101lpur; and the Jhelum, Chen\u0101b, and R\u0101vi met north-east of Mult\u0101n, and flowing to the east of that city joined the Be\u0101s 28 miles south of it and east of Uch. Thus Mult\u0101n and Uch both lay in the Sind-S\u0101gar Do\u0101b. By 1397 the Chen\u0101b had altered its course westward and was flowing to the west of Mult\u0101n, as it still does. The part of the river which divides the modern District of Gujr\u0101t from Gujr\u0101nw\u0101la was known to the Muhammadan historians as the Sudh\u0101ra (Sodhra), from the town of that name on its left bank.\n\nChen\u0101b Canal, Lower.\u2014A perennial canal in the Punjab, taking off from the left bank of the Chen\u0101b river and watering the tract between it and the R\u0101vi. The greater part of this area was before the introduction of irrigation a desolate region, unpeopled except for a race of pastoral nomads known as Janglis. The land was for the most part Government waste, and was thus adapted for colonization on a scale hitherto untried in the history of India, if not of the world. The original work was designed as a small inundation canal and opened as such in 1887, but in 1889 it was decided to convert it into a perennial canal of the first magnitude. The head-works of the canal are at Kh\u0101nki, a village in Gujr\u0101nw\u0101la District, 8 miles below Waz\u012br\u0101b\u0101d. Here there is a weir across the river, by which the supply to the canal is regulated and controlled. The main line of the canal has a bed-width of 250 feet, and has been run with a depth of about 11 feet and a discharge of 11,000 cubic feet per second, or about six times the ordinary flow of the Thames at Teddington. This weir was commenced in 1890 and completed in 1892. The largest branch of the canal, the Gugera, carrying about one-half of the total supply, takes off from the left bank of the main line at the 28th mile. It has a length of 55 miles and then bifurcates into two subsidiary branches, the Gugera Lower and the Buralla, with lengths of 77 and 46 miles respectively. On the right bank, not far from the same off-take, is the Kot Nikka branch with a length of 18 miles. The extreme length of the main line is 40 miles, and it then divides into the Jhang, Rakh, and Mi\u0101n Ali branches. The Jhang is the second largest branch of the system, and carries about 3,000 cubic feet per second. Its length is about 62 miles, before it bifurcates into the Jhang Lower (38 miles) and the Bhow\u0101na (7\u00bd miles long). The lengths of the Rakh and Mi\u0101n Ali are 55 and 27 miles respectively. The total\nlength of the main channels is 426 miles. For the distribution of the water-supply from the branches to the watercourses which directly irrigate the land there were, at the end of 1903-4, 2,323 miles of distributaries; and for the villages colonized by Government there had been constructed about 11,000 miles of watercourses. The total area commanded by the canal at the end of 1903-4 was 5,255 square miles in Gujranwala, Lahore, Jhang, and Montgomery Districts, of which 3,098 square miles were irrigated, an area which is capable of substantial increase. The total area of Government waste in the Doab is about 3,817 square miles, of which 2,827 square miles of land commanded by the canal had been allotted by the end of 1903-4.\n\nThe grantees are divided into three classes\u2014capitalists, yeomen, and peasants; the greater part of the land has been distributed to peasants, who are by far the most satisfactory tenants. For the purpose of allotment the whole of the Government waste has been divided into squares, the side of each square being 1,100 feet and the area about 28 acres. A peasant's grant consists of from one-half to three squares, a yeoman's of four or five, and a capitalist's of any number from five to twenty or more; and each settler is practically guaranteed water for the annual irrigation of a certain percentage of his holding. The Government retains the proprietary rights in the land, and the colonists are its tenants, the peasants for a term of years, the yeomen with right of continued occupancy so long as they pay their assessment, while the capitalists have also the right to purchase proprietary rights in their tenancy after the lapse of a certain period. There are also tenures which carry the liability to provide a certain number of camels for military service. For the purpose of distributing the land and of settling the colonists in villages, a special colonization officer has been appointed with head-quarters at Lyallpur. There were 1,423 villages in 1903-4, the average size being about 50 squares or 1,400 acres. The population of the colony at the Census of 1901 was 782,690, and may ultimately reach two and a half millions. A railway for the transport of produce has been constructed, running the whole length of the Doab from Wazirabad to Khewal, and several feeder-lines are under consideration. The capital cost of the canal up to the end of 1903-4 was about 280 lakhs. The canal earned a large revenue even while under construction, while the profits in 1903-4 amounted to 24 per cent. on the capital invested. The gross and net revenue derived therefrom in that year amounted to about 84 and 66 lakhs respectively. By 1913 the net revenue is likely to be very considerably increased, and the interest on the capital invested may amount to 30 per cent., while the value of the crops raised in a year is estimated to rise to 650 lakhs. The canal has thus not only enormously relieved the pressure of population in the congested\nDistricts of the Punjab, but has proved a most remunerative investment, besides adding largely to the general wealth of the country. An extensive telegraph system runs from the head of the canal down its main line and branches, and along some of its larger distributaries, thus facilitating rapid regulation of supply.\n\n**Chen\u00e1b Inundation Canals.**\u2014A system of inundation canals in the Punjab, taking off from the left bank of the Chen\u00e1b below its confluence with the R\u0101vi, and irrigating part of the Mult\u0101n and Shuj\u0101b\u0101d tahsils of Mult\u0101n District. They were for the most part constructed by the Path\u0101n rulers of Mult\u0101n and Shuj\u0101b\u0101d, and were once thirteen in number; but by amalgamation the heads in the river have been reduced to four, the Mattithal, Wali Muhammad, Sikandar\u0101b\u0101d, and Sikandarw\u0101h. As the canal-irrigated land is much lower than the river level in July and August, the outer banks of the canals are made specially high and strong to keep the flood-waters from pouring over the cultivated land, and in certain lengths of the river embankments have been constructed. In this way there is a chain of protection about 80 miles long on the east bank of the river. The maximum discharge of the canals is 5,200 cubic feet per second; there are 252 miles of main canals and 46 miles of Government distributaries. Until recently water was taken from the main canals entirely by private watercourses, but the construction of properly aligned distributaries is now in progress. The system by which the cultivators, in lieu of paying for the water, provided labour for silt clearance has recently been abolished, and occupiers' rates imposed. No capital account is kept for these canals. The gross revenue for the three years ending 1903\u20134 averaged 3\u00b73 lakhs yearly, and the net revenue Rs. 47,000. The average area irrigated for the six years ending 1903\u20134 was 214 square miles.\n\n**Chengalpat.**\u2014District, subdivision, taluk, and town in Madras. See Chingleput.\n\n**Chennagiri.**\u2014Taluk of Shimoga District, Mysore. See Channagiri.\n\n**Chera (or Kerala).**\u2014The name of one of the oldest kingdoms in Southern India. The exact locality is still a subject of dispute, but it is certain that it included the western coast of the Madras Presidency. It is doubtful whether the kingdom was simply synonymous with Kerala, which was the name of the whole western coast, including Travancore, or whether Chera was an older name for the kingdoms of Kerala and of the Kongu kings combined. If the latter, it embraced, besides the present Districts of Kanara and Malabar and the Native States of Cochin and Travancore, the Districts of Coimbatore and Salem, with parts of Mysore and the Nilgiris. In the earliest historical days, Chera, Chola, and P\u0101ndya formed the three great southern kingdoms, the confines of which met, according to tradition, at a place\non the Cauvery river, 11 miles east of Karur. The date of the origin of the Chera dynasty is unknown, but it was in existence early in the Christian era. It is mentioned in the edicts of Asoka and by Ptolemy. Towards the end of the ninth or beginning of the tenth century, the Chera country was overrun by the Cholas. Their dominion appears to have continued until the end of the eleventh century, when it was probably checked by the Hoysalas of Dorasamudra (Halebid in Mysore), but they held the country till they were overthrown by the Muhammadans in A.D. 1310. The latter were shortly afterwards driven out by a Hindu confederation, headed by the rising chiefs of Vijayanagar, and for two centuries were held in check, while the Vijayanagar empire, which absorbed the ancient State of Chera, grew to its greatest height of prosperity and grandeur. In 1565 the Vijayanagar kingdom was destroyed by the Muhammadans; but the Chera country was probably held by the Naiks of Madura till the period when the whole of Southern India was devastated by the constant strife between the rising kings of Mysore, the Madura Naiks, and the Muhammadans. In 1640 the Chera country was captured by the armies of the Adil Shahi dynasty of Bijapur, and was seized by the Mysore king in 1652. Perpetual strife ensued, ending only on the downfall of Tipu Sultan and the capture of Seringapatam.\n\nCher\u0101t.\u2014Hill sanitarium and cantonment in the Naushahra tahsil of Peshawar District, North-West Frontier Province, situated in 33\u00b0 50' N. and 71\u00b0 54' E., on the west of the Khattak range, 30 miles south-east of Peshawar. Cher\u0101t, which is 4,500 feet above sea-level, was first used as a sanitarium for troops in 1861, and was declared a cantonment in 1886. A hospital, a church, and a few bungalows have been built. The station has a good water-supply, and is throughout the summer the head-quarters of the Peshawar division command, and of one of the two British regiments stationed at Peshawar. A detachment of the other British regiment is also sent here. The mean temperature in June is 82\u00b0 at Cher\u0101t, compared with 90\u00b0 at Peshawar, and the nights are bearable. The hill commands a view of the whole of the Peshawar valley on one side, and on the other of a portion of the Khwarra valley in Peshawar District, and of Kohat District as far as the Indus. The population, according to the Census of March, 1901, was only 376 (no Europeans), but in the hot season the garrison sometimes numbers 1,000 men.\n\nCherial.\u2014T\u0101luk in Nalgonda District, Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State, with an area of 647 square miles. Its population in 1901, including j\u0101girs, was 104,142, compared with 89,868 in 1891. The t\u0101luk contained 128 villages, of which 27 are j\u0101gir, and Cherial (population, 2,731) was its head-quarters. The land revenue in 1901 was 1.7 lakhs. Rice is extensively raised by tank irrigation. In 1905 a number of villages\nwere added to Cherial from the Vardanapet taluk of Warangal District, which was abolished, and Cherial was transferred to Nalgonda District. The present head-quarters are at Jangaon (population, 1,696), a station on the Nizam's State Railway.\n\nCherra.\u2014Petty State in the Kh\u0101si Hills, Assam. The population in 1901 was 8,155, and the gross revenue in 1903-4 Rs. 7,900. Coal and iron are found, but are not largely worked. Other products include potatoes and oranges, in which there is a considerable trade, cotton, millet, betel-nut, j\u0101n, chillies, ginger, and honey. The title to the Siemship of the State is disputed, and on the occasion of the appointment of a new Siem in 1901 there were serious riots.\n\nCherrapunji.\u2014Village in the Kh\u0101si Hills, Assam, situated in 25\u00b0 15' N. and 91\u00b0 44' E., on a plateau overlooking the plains of Sylhet, 4,455 feet above sea-level. Cherrapunji is famous as having the highest recorded rainfall of any place in Asia. The annual fall averages 458 inches, but in 1861 a total of 905 inches fell, of which 366 were received in the month of July. In 1876 nearly 41 inches of rain fell in 24 hours. The Kh\u0101si Hills at this point rise straight from the plains, and the south-west monsoon blowing across the flooded tracts of Eastern Bengal and Sylhet is suddenly stopped by this barrier. The air, which is saturated with moisture, cools and is precipitated in the form of rain. The village is situated on a plateau overlooking the plains, bounded by gorges on either side, and is thus completely surrounded by cooling vapour. The administrative head-quarters of the Kh\u0101si and Jainti\u0101 Hills were originally fixed at this place, but they were transferred to Shillong in 1864. The remains of the bungalows, which were built of solid masonry, formed an interesting spectacle, but were much damaged by the earthquake of 1897. Cherrapunji contains a dispensary, an English middle school, and a branch of the Welsh Presbyterian Mission. Coal is found near the top of an isolated ridge, steeply scarped on every side and rising to about 300 feet above the level of the plateau. The seam lies in a horizontal position on a bed of limestone, and its outcrop, where not concealed by jungle or d\u00e9bris, forms a continuous ribbon, following the contours of the hill. The coal is of excellent quality, and is fit for use on steamers, but at present it is only worked in a desultory and unscientific manner by the Kh\u0101si villagers. The total quantity in the field is estimated at more than a million tons.\n\nChetwai.\u2014Village in the Ponn\u0101ni taluk of Malabar District, Madras, situated in 10\u00b0 32' N. and 76\u00b0 3' E., in the amsam (parish) of Vadana-palli. Population (1901), 3,216. It was formerly the terminus of the line of backwater communication extending to Cochin and Travancore, but is of little importance now that communication by water has been opened up to Ponn\u0101ni. In 1717 the Dutch took Chetwai from the\nZamorin, built a fort, and made it the capital of their province of Pappinivattam. In 1776 the fort was captured by Haidar Ali. Chetwai passed into British possession in 1790 and was leased to the Cochin Raja till 1805, when it came under the Company's direct administration. Only the foundations of the fort now remain.\n\nChey\u00fcr.\u2014Town in the Madurantakam taluk of Chingleput District, Madras, situated in $12^\\circ 21' N.$ and $80^\\circ E.$, 13 miles south-east of Madurantakam town. It is the chief place in the Chey\u00fcr zamindari and a Union. Population (1901), 5,210. Chey\u00fcr contains three temples, dedicated to Kailasanathar, Subrahmanya, and Valmikanathar, in which are valuable inscriptions relating to the Chola dynasty. It also contains extensive salt-pans. A weekly fair is held every Thursday.\n\nChhabra District.\u2014One of the Central India parganas of the State of Tonk, Rajputana. It is for certain purposes included in the political charge of the Resident at Gwalior. It has an area of 312 square miles, and lies between $24^\\circ 28'$ and $24^\\circ 53'$ N. and $76^\\circ 43'$ and $77^\\circ 5'$ E., being bounded on the north by Gwalior and Kotah, on the west by Kotah, and on the south and east by Gwalior. It is in shape an irregular triangle, and consists of three natural divisions\u2014agricultural, munjwara, and pichwara\u2014the first of which is flat and fertile, while the other two are crossed by a range of well-wooded hills. The principal rivers are the Parbati and its tributary, the Andheri; neither actually enters the district, the former flowing along the entire eastern and northern borders, and the latter forming the western boundary for about 25 miles. The population in 1901 was 36,046, compared with 46,473 in 1891. There are 185 villages and one town, CHHABRA (population, 6,724). The principal castes are Chamars, Dhakars, Brahmins, and Dodhas, forming respectively 11, 9, 7, and 7 per cent. of the total. The Chhabra pargana is said to have been first colonized by the Khichi Chauhan Rajputs, and in 1295 Gugal Singh of this clan founded the fort of Gugor, which was for a long time the chief town. Towards the end of the eighteenth century the district passed into the hands of Jaswant Rao Holkar, who in 1816 made it over to Amir Khan, to whom its possession was guaranteed by the British Government in the treaty of 1817. Of the total area, about 245 square miles, or 78 per cent., are khalsa, paying revenue direct to the State, and the khalsa area available for cultivation is about 166 square miles. Of this, about 79 square miles, or 47 per cent., were cultivated in 1903-4, the irrigated area being 7 square miles. Of the cropped area, wheat occupied about 36 per cent., jowar 29, gram 8, maize 6, and poppy 5\u00bd per cent. The revenue from all sources is about 1.4 lakhs, of which three-fourths is derived from the land. Oranges are a speciality of the place, and are exported in considerable quantities. The Bina-Baran branch of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway runs for about 22 miles through the\ndistrict, having two stations, one about a mile north of Chhabra town.\n\n**Chhabra Town.**\u2014Head-quarters of the *pargana* of the same name in the State of Tonk, R\u0101jput\u0101na (within the limits of the Central India Agency), situated in $24^\\circ 39'$ N. and $76^\\circ 52'$ E., on the right bank of a stream called the Retri, about 125 miles south-east of Tonk city, and one mile south of Chhabra station on the B\u012bna-B\u0101ran branch of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway. Population (1901), 6,724. The town possesses a strong fort, said to have been built by the Khichis in the fifteenth century, a post and telegraph office, a small jail, a vernacular school, and a dispensary for out-patients.\n\n**Chhachhrauli.**\u2014Capital of the Kalsia State, Punjab, situated in $30^\\circ 15'$ N. and $77^\\circ 25'$ E. Population (1901), 5,520. The income of the municipality, wholly derived from octroi, was Rs. 2,769 in 1903-4, and the expenditure Rs. 1,170. The town possesses an Anglo-ver- nacular middle school and a dispensary.\n\n**Chhal\u0101la.**\u2014Petty State in K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r, Bombay.\n\n**Chh\u0101liar.**\u2014Petty State in Rew\u0101 K\u0101nth\u0101, Bombay.\n\n**Chhapi\u0101.**\u2014Village in the Utraul\u0101 *tahsil* of Gond\u0101 District, United Provinces, situated in $26^\\circ 59'$ N. and $82^\\circ 24'$ E., on the Bengal and North-Western Railway. Population (1901), 732. The village, commonly known as Sw\u0101mi N\u0101r\u0101yan Chhapi\u0101, to distinguish it from other places of the same name, is celebrated as the birthplace of Sahaj\u0101nand, a religious reformer in the early part of the nineteenth century. He migrated to Gadhada in Gujar\u0101t, and became a learned Sanskrit scholar and ascetic. He is now worshipped as an incarnation of Krishna under the name Sw\u0101mi N\u0101r\u0101yan. A large temple of stone and marble, which has been erected at considerable expense, contains relics of Sahaj\u0101nand, besides images of various deities. It is adorned both inside and out with paintings. Two large fairs are held annually.\n\n**Chhaprauli.**\u2014Town in the B\u0101ghpat *tahsil* of Meerut District, United Provinces, situated in $29^\\circ 12'$ N. and $77^\\circ 11'$ E., 35 miles north-west of Meerut city. Population (1901), 7,058. It is said to have been founded by J\u0101ts in the eighth century. In the eighteenth century the J\u0101ts of Mirpur, who had been almost ruined by the incursions of the Sikhs, migrated here, and added to the population and prosperity of the town. There is a large colony of Jain Bani\u0101s, who are people of some wealth. The town is administered under Act XX of 1856, with an income of about Rs. 2,000. It is increasing in importance as a centre for the collection and export of wheat and sugar. There is a primary school.\n\n**Chh\u0101ta Tahsil.**\u2014North-western *tahsil* of Muttra District, United Provinces, conterminous with the *pargana* of the same name, lying between $27^\\circ 33'$ and $27^\\circ 56'$ N. and $77^\\circ 17'$ and $77^\\circ 42'$ E., with an area of 406 square miles. Population rose from 153,465 in 1891 to\nThere are 158 villages and two towns, Kosi (population, 9,565) and Chhata (8,287), the tahsil head-quarters. The demand for land revenue in 1903-4 was Rs. 3,38,000, and for cesses Rs. 59,000. The density of population, 428 persons per square mile, is the lowest in the District. Up to 1894 the northern portion formed a separate tahsil called Kost. The tahsil is bounded on the east by the Jumna, which is fringed with ravines and a sandy strip of land; but these are not so extensive as in the Muttra tahsil to the south. A ridge of sand traverses the centre, and another narrow belt is found farther west, beyond which is a shallow depression not sufficiently marked to form a drainage channel. The western boundary is formed by the Bharatpur State, and in places low stone hills are found. In the north the wells are very deep and the water they contain is usually brackish. The autumn harvest is more important here than the spring harvest, and jowar is the most common staple. In 1903-4 the area under cultivation was 329 square miles, of which 113 were irrigated. The Agra Canal supplies a rather larger area than wells. A drain has recently been completed from a depression near Kosi to the Jumna.\n\nChhata Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the tahsil of the same name in Muttra District, United Provinces, situated in 27\u00b0 44' N. and 77\u00b0 31' E., on the Agra-Delhi road. Population (1901), 8,287. The principal feature of the town is its large fort-like sarai, covering an area of 12 acres, with battlemented walls and bastions, and two lofty gateways of decorated stonework, dating from the time of Sher Shah or Akbar. The interior is disfigured by a number of mean mud huts. During the Mutiny of 1857 the sarai was occupied by the rebels, who, however, had to blow one of the towers down before they could effect an entrance. The town is administered under Act XX of 1856, with an income of about Rs. 1,200. Trade is chiefly local. There is a primary school with about 80 pupils.\n\nChhatak.\u2014Village in the Sunamganj subdivision of Sylhet District, Eastern Bengal and Assam, situated in 25\u00b0 2' N. and 91\u00b0 40' E., on the left bank of the Surma. The river is navigable by steamers up to this point all the year round, and there is a large export trade to Bengal in lime, potatoes, and oranges. A tall masonry obelisk, erected in memory of Mr. Inglis, who founded a large business in lime, stands on the summit of a low hill, from which a magnificent view is obtained over river, swamp, and forest to the blue line of the Khasi Hills, which rise like a wall from the plain. This obelisk was cracked in three places by the earthquake of 1897, and the pieces were wrenched round in the same plane without being thrown down.\n\nChhatari.\u2014Town in the Khurja tahsil of Bulandshahr District, United Provinces, situated in 28\u00b0 6' N. and 78\u00b0 9' E., 30 miles south of Bulandshahr town. Population (1901), 5,574. The town takes its\nname from the Chhatardh\u0101ri clan of Mew\u0101tis who founded it. It belongs to the estate of the same name founded by Mahm\u016bd Ali Kh\u0101n, a brother of Mur\u0101d Ali Kh\u0101n of Pah\u0101s\u016b. The estate is at present under the Court of Wards, as the owner, Ahmad Saiyid Kh\u0101n, is a minor. Chhat\u0101ri is administered under Act XX of 1856, with an income of about Rs. 800. There is a primary school with about 120 pupils.\n\nChhatarpur State.\u2014A sanad State in Central India, under the Bundelkhand Agency, lying between $24^\\circ 21'$ and $25^\\circ 15'$ N. and $79^\\circ 34'$ and $80^\\circ 8'$ E., with an area of 1,118 square miles. It is bounded on the north by the Hamirpur District of the United Provinces and part of the Charkh\u0101ri State; on the east by the Ken river, which separates it from the States of Ajaigarh and Pann\u0101; on the west by portions of the Bij\u0101war and Charkh\u0101ri States; and on the south by the Bij\u0101war and Pann\u0101 States and the British District of Damoh in the Central Provinces. The greater part of the State consists of a level plain with a mean elevation of 600 feet above the sea, covered with trees and watered by numerous tanks. The only important streams are the Ken, with its tributaries the Urmal and Kutri, which flow during the greater part of the year.\n\nThe main portion of the State lies in the Bundelkhand gneiss area. The portion immediately surrounding the chief town, however, falls within the Jumna alluvial tract, while in the south-eastern part of the State, which is situated in the Pann\u0101 range, the Ken and its tributaries have cut deep gorges exposing the massive Vindhyan sandstones. The Rewah shales, which also occur, are a continuation of the diamond-bearing tract of Pann\u0101, though there is no record of their ever having been searched for stones. The Lower Vindhyan strata, with outcrops of the Bij\u0101wars at their base, and the Kaimur sandstones are also met with, the last yielding superb building material. The climate is temperate, and the annual rainfall averages 46 inches.\n\nThe State of Chhatarpur was founded in the latter part of the eighteenth century by Kunwar Sone S\u0101h Ponw\u0101r or Pam\u0101r, a retainer of R\u0101j\u0101 Hindupat of Pann\u0101, out of territories belonging to that State. On Hindupat's death in 1777 his son Sarnat Singh was forced to leave the State, and retired to R\u0101jnagar, near Chhatarpur. He died, leaving a minor son, Hira Singh, whose guardian was Kunwar Sone S\u0101h Ponw\u0101r. Taking advantage of the youth of his master, Sone S\u0101h seized the j\u0101g\u012br in 1785, to which he added much territory during the disturbed period of the Mar\u0101th\u0101 invasion. In 1800 he, together with the other Bundelkhand chiefs, became tributary to Ali Bah\u0101dur, the Naw\u0101b of B\u0101nd\u0101. On the establishment of British supremacy in Bundelkhand, Sone S\u0101h received a sanad in 1806, by which certain lands he then held were secured to him, while others, including the\ntown of Chhatarpur, were reserved to the British. In 1808, however, these lands also were made over to him. Sone Sah died in 1816, having divided his possessions among his five sons. Later a redistribution was made by which the share of Pratap Singh, the eldest son, was considerably reduced. The British Government disapproved of this second partition as unjust to Pratap Singh, and as opposed to its policy of maintaining the integrity of the Bundelkhand States; and it was ruled that on the death of his brothers their jagirs should revert to the State. Bakht Singh, the youngest brother, who had been unable to manage his estate, made it over to his brother Pratap Singh, receiving in lieu a cash allowance of Rs. 2,250 a month. Included in his holding was a muafi (or free grant) of three villages belonging to the Dikshit family of Bilhert, held under grants given by Rajah Hindupat. This muafi is still held by the family as a guaranteed holding subordinate to the Chhatarpur Darbar, to whom the muafidur is obliged to refer in all matters of internal administration. In 1827 the title of Rajah Bahadur was granted to the chief. Pratap Singh died in 1854; and the Directors of the East India Company, rejecting his adoption of Jagat Raj, grandson of Bakht Singh, held that owing to failure of direct heirs the State escheated to Government. In consideration, however, of the loyalty of the Chhatarpur chiefs, a fresh sanad was, as an act of grace and favour, granted to Jagat Raj, and as he was only eight years old Pratap Singh's second Rani was appointed regent. She was at the head of the State during the Mutiny of 1857, and gave asylum to the refugees from Nowgong. In 1862 a sanad of adoption was granted to the chief. The following year the Rani was removed from the regency for maladministration, and the State was placed under a European officer. In 1867 the chief received powers of administration, but died the next year, his son Vishvanath Singh, the present chief, succeeding at the age of fourteen months. The State remained under European supervision until 1876, when the dowager Rani was made regent, but misrule necessitated her removal from the position in 1878. Vishvanath Singh commenced to administer his State in 1887, and received enhanced criminal powers in 1894, and the personal title of Maharaja in 1895. The Chhatarpur chief is the head of the Bundelkhand Ponwars or Pamars, a local section of the great Agnikula clan which separated from the parent stock in the thirteenth century. The hereditary titles are His Highness and Rajah, and he receives a salute of 11 guns.\n\nMany archaeological remains are met with in the State, the most important collection of buildings being at Khajuraho, where one of the finest groups of temples in Northern India is to be seen. At the old town of Mau, 10 miles west of Chhatarpur, once the seat of the Parihars Rajputs, there are numerous buildings. These, however, with the\nexception of a few Chandel remains (including an undated inscription assigned to about 1150), are all in the eighteenth-century style and of little architectural merit, having been erected in the time of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Chhatars\u0101l. Many fine tanks are attributed to the Chandels, of which the Jagat S\u0101gar at Mau, the Imlika Talao at R\u0101jnagar, and the Jhinna S\u0101gar at Lauri are the largest. At Many\u0101garh, on the west bank of the Ken, close to R\u0101jigarh, 20 miles south-east of Chhatarpur town, are the remains of an old fort which was originally one of the Ath Kot, or 'eight strongholds,' for which Bundelkhand was famous. The ruins are now buried in jungle. The fort was probably called after Many\u0101 Dev\u012b, who, according to the bard Chand, was a tutelary deity of the Chandels.\n\nThe population at the last three enumerations was: (1881) 164,369, (1891) 174,148, and (1901) 156,139, giving a density of 140 persons per square mile. During the last decade there has been a decrease of 10 per cent., owing mainly to the famine of 1896\u20137. The State contains 421 villages, and one town, Chhatarpur (population, 10,029), the capital. Hindus number 148,343, or 95 per cent.; Musalm\u0101ns, 5,379; and Animists, 1,651, mainly Gonds, who inhabit the Deora tahsil. Bundelkhandi and its dialects Ban\u0101phari and Khatola are the prevalent forms of speech. The most numerous castes are Cham\u0101rs, 13,300; K\u0101chhis, 12,600; Kurmis, 11,000; Ahirs, 9,800; and Br\u0101hmans, 7,300. Agriculture supports 39 per cent., general labour 15 per cent., and State service 7 per cent. of the population.\n\nOf the total area of 1,118 square miles, 236 square miles, or 21 per cent., are under cultivation, of which 65 square miles are irrigated, chiefly from artificial tanks and wells. About 545 square miles of the uncultivated area are cultivable; 135 square miles, situated chiefly in the south of the State, are under forest; and the rest is waste. Of the cropped area, kodon occupies 80 square miles, or 34 per cent., til 50 square miles, barley 46, s\u0101m\u0101n and basara 39, jow\u0101r 26, gram 15, wheat 10, and cotton 6 square miles. The agriculturists are drawn from all classes, Br\u0101hmans, Th\u0101kurs, Lodh\u012bs, Kurmis, and Ahirs predominating.\n\nAbout 100 miles of metalled roads are maintained by the British Government, being portions of the Chhatarpur-Sam\u0101, Chhatarpur-B\u0101nd\u0101, and Nowgong-B\u0101nd\u0101 high roads, and part of a feeder-road from Mahob\u0101 to Chandla. Little trade is carried on except at the chief town. The principal exports are grain, oilseeds, and spices; the imports are piece-goods, grain, metals, and salt. A British combined post and telegraph office is maintained at Chhatarpur, and a branch post office at R\u0101jnagar.\n\nFor administrative purposes the State is divided into four tahsils, each under a tahsild\u0101r, who is the magistrate and revenue officer of his\ncharge, the head-quarters being at Chhatarpur, Rajnagar, Lauri, and Deora. The chief has entire control in all administrative and civil judicial matters. In criminal cases he is specially empowered by a sanad, granted in 1894, to try heinous crimes, with the proviso that all sentences of death must be referred to the Agent to the Governor-General for confirmation, and a periodical report submitted to the Political Agent of all cases involving transportation or imprisonment for life. The British codes are followed generally in the criminal courts. For civil cases local rules have been drawn up.\n\nThe total normal revenue from all sources is 3-5 lakhs, of which 2-9 lakhs is derived from land revenue. The chief heads of expenditure are: Rs. 47,000 on the general administration, including the chief's establishment; Rs. 25,000 on the collection of land revenue; and Rs. 22,000 each on police, military, and public works.\n\nNo regular revenue settlement has been made. Most of the land is periodically leased out village by village to farmers, who are responsible for the revenue. The State has in such cases no direct concern with the cultivators, who make their own terms with the farmers, the Darbar, however, reserving the right to intervene in cases of oppression. The incidence of the land revenue demand is about Rs. 1-11-0 per acre of cultivated land, and 6 annas per acre on the total area. Rates are\u2014\nfor mar (black soil), Rs. 1-3-2 to Rs. 1-9-7; for parwa and kahar (light soils), R. 0-12-10 to Rs. 1-3-2 each; for rankar, a stony soil, R. 0-9-7 to R. 1 per acre. Special rates, varying from 12 annas to Rs. 31, are levied on land growing betel-vines and sugar-cane.\n\nIn 1882 the British rupee was made legal tender, in place of the Raj\u0101 shahi rupee struck at Chhatarpur, and other local currencies.\n\nThe army consists of 112 regular infantry and 30 regular cavalry, and 440 irregular troops, besides 40 gunners with 27 guns. A regular police system was introduced in 1863, and has recently been reorganized. The force includes 120 State police and 277 rural police. The jail is at Chhatarpur.\n\nIn 1901 only 1-6 per cent. (3 males and 0-1 females) of the population were able to read and write. A school was first started at Chhatarpur in 1865, and made a high school in 1884. Pupils are sent up for the Allahabad University examinations. There are 23 other schools for boys and two for girls, with a total of 765 pupils, of whom 44 are girls; the annual expenditure is Rs. 6,700. A hospital is maintained at Chhatarpur. Vaccination is regularly carried on and is becoming yearly more popular.\n\nChhatarpur Town.\u2014Chief town of the State of the same name in Central India, situated in 24\u00b0 55' N. and 79\u00b0 36' E., at the junction of the roads from Band\u0101 to Saugor and Nowgong to Satna, 34 miles distant by road from Harpalpur on the Jhansi-Manikpur section of the\nGreat Indian Peninsula Railway, 15 miles from Nowgong cantonment, 86 miles from Satn\u0101, and 78 miles from B\u0101nd\u0101. Population (1901), 10,029. It is named after Chhatars\u0101l of Pann\u0101, by whom it was founded in 1707. Chhatarpur is a fine town, surrounded on three sides by a wall, and contains many well-built houses. The chief's palace is a large substantial building, standing in the centre of the city in a fine garden. Its appearance is enhanced by numerous monuments erected by Gosains, who settled here nearly two centuries ago under the protection of R\u0101j\u0101 Pah\u0101r Singh of Pann\u0101, and are said to have assisted Sone S\u0101h in acquiring Chhatarpur. Before the opening of railways had diverted traffic from the roads, Chhatarpur was a considerable trade centre, salt, sugar, soap, iron, and brassware being its chief articles of commerce. In the town are a dispensary, a high school, one other school for boys and two for girls, a school of art for the encouragement of local industries, two sarais for native travellers, an inspection bungalow belonging to the Government Public Works department, and a State guesthouse.\n\nChhattisgarh Division.\u2014Eastern Division of the Central Provinces, lying between $19^\\circ 50'$ and $23^\\circ 7'$ N. and $80^\\circ 43'$ and $83^\\circ 38'$ E., with an area of 21,240 square miles. It consists of the plain forming the upper basin of the Mah\u0101nad\u012b river, hemmed in by ranges of hills on the north, west, and south. The Division contains three Districts, as shown below:\n\n| District | Area in square miles | Population, 1901 | Land revenue with cesses 1901-4, in thousands of rupees |\n|----------|---------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| Drug     | 3,807               | 628,885          | 5,64                                                   |\n| Raipur   | 9,831               | 1,096,858        | 6,88                                                   |\n| Bil\u0101spur | 7,602               | 917,240          | 4,07                                                   |\n| Total    | 21,240              | 2,642,983        | 26,59                                                  |\n\nUp to 1905, the Division also included Sambalpur District, which was then transferred to Bengal. The District of Drug was constituted in 1906 from portions of the old Raipur and Bil\u0101spur Districts, which were too large for effective management. The name Chhattisgarh, or 'thirty-six forts,' was formerly applied to the territories of the Haihaiyansi dynasty of Ratanpur, which comprised the greater part of the present Districts of Drug, Raipur, and Bil\u0101spur. Far removed from the routes of armies, and protected from invasion or disturbance by the precipitous ranges which fringe the plain on three sides, the Haihaiyansi kingdom continued to enjoy a peaceful and uneventful existence until the middle of the eighteenth century; while the people, isolated and\nalmost barred from intercourse with the outside world, have developed or retained peculiarities of dress, manners, and language which distinguish them from the residents of adjoining tracts, to whom they are known as Chhattisgarhis. The Chhattisgarhi dialect resembles the form of Hindi spoken in Oudh. The people are generally held to be characterized by a lack of intelligence, by backwardness in their methods of agriculture, and by a more primitive habit of life than their neighbours. The head-quarters of the Commissioner are at Raipur town. The population of the Division in 1881 was 2,495,655, and increased to 2,924,663 in 1891, or by 17 per cent. The Census of 1901 showed a decrease to 2,642,983, or by 10 per cent., the Chhattisgarh plain having been visited by two severe famines during the previous decade. In 1901 Hindus constituted 90 per cent. of the total population and Animists 8 per cent., while there were only 30,000 Musalmans, 1,100 Jains, and 5,800 Christians, of whom 400 were Europeans and Eurasians. The density of population is 124 persons per square mile, compared with 112 for British Districts of the Province. It contains 7 towns, including Drug, the head-quarters of the new Drug District, and 9,356 inhabited villages. The marked absence of towns is to be explained by the fact that the population is almost solely agricultural, and until within comparatively recent years there has been very little trade. Raipur (32,114) is the chief commercial centre of the Division, and the only town containing more than 20,000 inhabitants. On the outskirts of the plain and surrounding the British Districts are situated the territories of fourteen Feudatory States, whose administration is controlled by a Political Agent under the supervision of the Commissioner.\n\nChhibr\u0101mau Tahsil.\u2014South central tahsil of Farrukh\u0101b\u0101d District, United Provinces, comprising the parganas of Chhibr\u0101mau and T\u0101lgr\u0101m, and lying between 26\u00b0 58' and 27\u00b0 14' N. and 79\u00b0 23' and 79\u00b0 47' E., with an area of 240 square miles. It is bounded by the East K\u0101lt Nadi and Ganges on the north, and by the Isan on the south. Population increased from 111,114 in 1891 to 126,705 in 1901. There are 240 villages and two towns: CHHIBR\u0100MAU (population, 6,526), the tahsil head-quarters, and T\u0100LGR\u0100M (5,457). The demand for land revenue in 1903-4 was Rs. 1,90,000, and for cesses Rs. 32,000. The density of population, 528 persons per square mile, is almost the same as the District average. In the centre of the tahsil there is a level stretch of fertile loam, crossed from north to south in the west by a ridge of sandy soil, and with sandy slopes approaching the alluvial soil on the banks of the rivers. The eastern portion is remarkable for the large area covered by swamps and lakes. The area under cultivation in 1903-4 was 160 square miles, of which 64 were irrigated. The Bewar branch of the Lower Ganges Canal supplies about 14 square\nmiles in the west of the tahsil, and wells most of the remainder, but tanks or jhils irrigate 4 or 5 square miles. In several villages bhang (Indian hemp) is cultivated.\n\n**Chhibr\u0101mau Town.**\u2014Head-quarters of the tahsil of the same name in Farrukhab\u0101d District, United Provinces, situated in 27\u00b0 9' N. and 79\u00b0 31' E. It lies on the grand trunk road, and is connected by an unmetalled road with Farrukhab\u0101d city. Population (1901), 6,526. The early history of the town is legendary, but by the time of Akbar it was the head-quarters of a pargana. Naw\u0101b Muhammad Kh\u0101n of Farrukhab\u0101d, early in the eighteenth century, founded a new quarter called Muhammadganj, with a fine sarai which was improved 100 years later by a British Collector. The town prospered by its situation on the grand trunk road. It is administered under Act XX of 1856, with an income of about Rs. 1,100. It contains a tahs\u012bl and dispensary. A market is held twice a week. The town school has 120 pupils, and two primary schools 57.\n\n**Chhindw\u0101ra District.**\u2014District in the Nerbudda Division of the Central Provinces, lying between 21\u00b0 28' and 22\u00b0 49' N. and 78\u00b0 10' and 79\u00b0 24' E., on the S\u0101tpur\u0101 plateau, with an area of 4,631 square miles. It is bounded on the north by Hoshang\u0101b\u0101d and Narsinghpur; on the west by Bet\u016bl; on the east by Seoni; and on the south by N\u0101gpur, and along a small strip to the south-east by the Amr\u0101oti District of Ber\u0101r. The District may be described as consisting of three steps or sections of different elevation ascending from the south. Most of the Sausar tahsil lies below the S\u0101tpur\u0101s and forms part of the N\u0101gpur plain, with an elevation of about 1,100 feet. North of this is a section of the regular S\u0101tpur\u0101 plateau forming the m\u0101lgus\u0101ri area of the Chhindw\u0101ra tahsil, and lying at a general elevation of about 2,000 feet; while north again is a stretch of wild and mountainous country often rising to 3,000 feet above the sea, covered with forest, and divided into j\u0101girs or hereditary estates of the old hill chieftains. The marked features of the hill system are the range which forms the southern edge of the S\u0101tpur\u0101 plateau ascending sharply from the N\u0101gpur plain, and that which rises from the level of the plateau to the north and falls again to the Narbad\u0101 valley. A few peaks in the northern range rise to over 3,700 feet, and along its west extends a series of small plateaux separated by valleys and ravines. In the north-west the hills fall away in a strip of low-lying country, which in turn is flanked by the Mah\u0101deo range of Hoshang\u0101b\u0101d. A small range of foot-hills also divides the south of the District from N\u0101gpur. The surface of the Sausar tahsil is generally undulating, while that of the Chhindw\u0101ra tahsil is broken by isolated flat-topped\n\n---\n\n1 Land held on ordinary proprietary tenure, as distinct from the large imparible estates devolving by primogeniture, called in this District j\u0101girs.\nhillocks. The most level portions are the Chaurai tract bordering on Seoni, and the Saoli-Mohkher plain to the south-west of Chhindw\u0101ra town. Several tributaries of the Narbad\u0101 rise in the northern hills, but the drainage generally is to the south. The Kanh\u0101n river rises in the north-west of the District, and after traversing the Chhindw\u0101ra tahsil for about 30 miles turns to the east to descend the gh\u0101ts (hill passes) and subsequently crosses the Sausar tahsil into N\u0101gpur. The Pench also rises in the north-west, and after flowing east through the Chhindw\u0101ra tahsil turns to the south and forms the boundary between Chhindw\u0101ra and Seoni, its course in the District being about 160 miles. The Pench subsequently falls into the Kanh\u0101n, which is itself a tributary of the Waingang\u0101. The Kulbeher\u0101 in Chhindw\u0101ra and the J\u0101m in Sausar are affluents of the Pench and Kanh\u0101n respectively.\n\nThe greater part of the District is covered with the Deccan trap or volcanic rock, in which fossiliferous inter-trappean strata are met with at various localities. There are, however, considerable expanses of metamorphic and Gondw\u0101na rocks. The Upper Gondw\u0101nas occur in the hills abutting on Narsinghpur and Hoshang\u0101b\u0101d, while south of these the Lower Gondw\u0101na or Motur group is found. A stretch of crystalline rock extends over the west of the Chhindw\u0101ra tahsil and runs south-eastwards through the centre of Sausar. There are several coal-fields in the District.\n\nThe 'reserved' forests lie principally on the southern range of the S\u0101tpur\u0101s and on an irregular line of hills in the west of the District, while the northern range is covered by private forest. Teak and s\u0101j (Terminalia tomentosa) are the most important timber trees in the Government forests, while the j\u0101girs contain some s\u0101l (Shorea robusta). Among other trees may be mentioned tins\u0101 (Ougeinia dalbergioides), bij\u0101s\u0101l (Pterocarpus Marsupium), shisham (Dalbergia Sissoo), and lend\u0101 (Lagerstroemia parviflora). Various climbers, such as Miletta, Bauhinia, Spatholobus, and Porana, occur; and the undergrowth includes species of Grewia, Zizyphus, Phyllanthus, and Cleistanthus. Among grasses may be mentioned d\u016bb (Cynodon dactylon), kusal (Pollinia argentea), and r\u016bsa (Andropogon Schoenanthus).\n\nGame is by no means plentiful in the forests. Tigers are seldom met with, though leopards are more numerous and the true hunting leopard has been shot in Chhindw\u0101ra. A few wild buffalo and a fair number of bison are contained in the j\u0101gird\u0101ri forests, and the b\u0101r\u0101singh\u0101 or swamp deer is found in the District. Chhindw\u0101ra is not a good District for game-birds as there are very few tanks; but fish are found in the rivers and large streams in considerable numbers, and the mahseer in the Pench afford excellent sport, some specimens reaching a weight of 40 lb.\n\nThe climate in most parts is cold and healthy, being probably the\nmost favourable in the Province. The heat is seldom severe, while the light rainfall makes the monsoon season pleasant. In the cold season the temperature frequently falls below freezing-point, but ice is not often seen. The variations of temperature in different parts of the District correspond to those of elevation, the Sausar taluk having the same hot climate as Nagpur, while the highest range of the jagirs is as cool as Pachmarhi. The general health of the population is good, and epidemic disease is rare.\n\nThe annual rainfall at Chhindw\u0101ra averages 42 inches, that for Sausar being apparently somewhat less, if the returns are to be relied on.\n\nDeogarh, the head-quarters of the old Gond dynasty of Chhindw\u0101ra and Nagpur, is a village about 24 miles south-west of Chhindw\u0101ra, picturesquely situated on a crest of the hills. For a short period towards the end of its existence, the Deogarh kingdom became of such importance as to overshadow Mandl\u0101 and Ch\u0101nda, and to take first place among the Gond States. Of its earlier history practically nothing is known, but here, as elsewhere, popular tradition tells of a Gaoli kingdom preceding the Gonds. The mythical Gond hero J\u0101tba, who founded the dynasty, was born from a virgin under a bean plant, and was protected by a cobra, who came and spread its hood over him during the heat of the day, when his mother left him to go to her work. When he grew up he became famous for his feats of strength, and entered the service of the twin Gaoli kings, Rans\u016br and Ghans\u016br, whom he subsequently slew with a magic sword, and taking the kingdom in their stead became the first Gond ruler. The forts of Patansaongi and Nagardhan below the ghats are attributed to him. From J\u0101tba, whose date is absolutely uncertain, to Bakht Buland, at the end of the seventeenth century, tradition is almost silent. This prince went to Delhi and entered the service of Aurangzeb. He is supposed to have gained by his military achievements the favour of the emperor, by whom he was persuaded to become a Muhammadan. He was acknowledged as R\u0101j\u0101 of Deogarh, and returned from Delhi bringing with him a number of artificers and husbandmen, both Hindu and Muhammadan. He enlarged his dominions at the expense of Ch\u0101nda and Mandl\u0101, and established many new towns and villages, also founding the city of Nagpur. Bakht Buland's successor, Ch\u0101nd Sult\u0101n, removed the capital to Nagpur, which he made a walled town. The subsequent fall of the Gond dynasty and the acquisition of the Deogarh kingdom by Raghuji Bhonsla belong to the history of Nagpur. Chhindw\u0101ra became a part of the Mar\u0101th\u0101 kingdom; and during the latter period of the Bhonsla rule it suffered severely from rack-renting, and from the depredations of the Gond hill chiefs, who, as the Mar\u0101th\u0101 administration grew weaker,\ncame down from their mountain fortresses and plundered and harassed\nthe country without restriction. When Appa S\u0101hib was being sent\nto Allah\u0101b\u0101d in custody after the battle of Sit\u0101bd\u012b in 1818, he escaped\nto the territories of these chiefs and was there joined by the Pind\u0101ri\nleader Ch\u012b\u1e6da. The two were well received by the Gond j\u0101gird\u0101rs,\nand gave some trouble before they were expelled and the country\npacified. After the deposition of Appa S\u0101hib, Chhindw\u0101ra was for\nsome years administered by a British Superintendent under the control\nof the Resident at N\u0101gpur. It finally lapsed to the British Government,\nwith the rest of the N\u0101gpur territories, in 1853. Since the formation of\nthe District, the Almod, Bari\u0101m Pag\u0101ra, and part of the Pachmarhi\nj\u0101gir have been transferred to Hoshang\u0101b\u0101d, the Adegaon estate to\nSeoni, and the Bordehi tract to Bet\u016bl.\n\nNumerous remains of wells, tanks, and buildings at Deogarh show\nthat the old Gond capital must have extended over a large area. The\nDistrict is, however, singularly bare of notable buildings, even im-\nportant shrines being represented only by a chab\u016btra or platform and\nnot by a temple. The names of several hills, such as Hary\u0101garh and\nGarjugarh, preserve the recollection of the troublous times when they\nwere crowned with forts, but these have now entirely vanished.\n\nThe population of the District at the last three enumerations was as\nfollows: (1881) 372,899, (1891) 407,494, and (1901) 407,927. The decade\nbetween 1881 and 1891 was prosperous and the popu-\nlation increased steadily, the lowest increment being\nin the j\u0101girs. The last Census shows the total population as almost\nstationary; but there has been an increase of 3 per cent. in the\nm\u0101lguz\u0101r\u012b portion of the Chhindw\u0101ra t\u0101hsil, and a heavy decline of\n11 per cent. in the j\u0101girs. The District did not suffer so heavily as the\nrest of the Province in 1897, but was severely affected in 1900, and\nthere was probably some immigration from the j\u0101girs into the m\u0101lguz\u0101r\u012b\narea in both years. The District has four towns\u2014CHHINDW\u0100RA, the\nDistrict head-quarters, P\u0100NDHURNA, MONGAON, and SAUSAR\u2014and\n1,751 inhabited villages. The principal statistics of population in\n1901 are shown below:\n\n| Tahsil | Area in square miles | Number of | Population |\n|--------|---------------------|-----------|------------|\n|        |                     | Towns     | Villages   |\n| Chhindw\u0101ra | 3,528               | 1         | 1,368      |\n| Sausar  | 1,103               | 3         | 383        |\n| District total | 4,631               | 4         | 1,751      |\n\nThere are considerable variations in density in different areas, and\nthe open part of the Sausar tahsil is very thickly populated. The figures for religion show that 61\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) per cent. of the population are Hindus, 35 per cent. Animists, and 3 per cent. Muhammadans. The majority of the Gonds and Kork\u016bs are still returned as professing their tribal religion. Of the Muhammadans, 3,645 live in towns. About 45 per cent. of the population speak the Bundeli dialect of Western Hindi, 19 per cent. Mar\u0101th\u012b, and 25\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) per cent. Gondi. About two-thirds of the Gonds are returned as speaking their own language. Most of the Mar\u0101th\u012b speakers live in the Sausar tahsil, which adjoins N\u0101gpur and contains many Mar\u0101th\u0101 immigrants.\n\nBr\u0101hmans (8,000) are the principal landowning caste, including a few Marw\u0101r\u012b or Palliw\u0101l Br\u0101hmans who are professional money-lenders. The chief agricultural castes are Kurmis (8,000) and Kunbis (21,000), Bhoyars (17,000), Lodhis (9,000), Kir\u0101rs (8,000), and Raghuvansi (4,000). The Kurmis are wheat-growers and are found in the Chaurai tract, while the Kunbis raise the cotton and jow\u0101r of the Sausar tahsil. The Lodhis and Raghuvansi, though found only in small numbers, are fairly large landowners, and both are good cultivators. The Bhoyars are found in the P\u0101ndhurn\u0101 valley and along the head of the gh\u0101ts between Sausar and Chhindw\u0101ra. The Ahirs (33,000) are professional cattle-breeders and landowners. The Gonds (137,000), the old owners of the soil, constitute a third of the population, and all the j\u0101gird\u0101ris with two exceptions are R\u0101j Gonds. They reside principally in the northern hills and forests, but also in the open country. At the time of the wheat harvest they go down in large numbers to the Narb\u0101da valley, and obtain sufficient grain as wages to support them for a couple of months. Kork\u016bs number nearly 19,000, or 4\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) per cent. of the population. They include the subdivision of Mow\u0101s\u0101s, who consider themselves superior to the ordinary Kork\u016b. The Kork\u016bs are even poorer than the Gonds; they are not landholders at all, and where the two tribes are found together the Gonds have possession of the open country and the Kork\u016bs are relegated to the most jungly villages. About 72 per cent. of the District population are shown as supported by agriculture.\n\nChristians number 474, including 455 natives, of whom the majority are converts of the Swedish Lutheran Mission at Chhindw\u0101ra. This body supports a large orphanage and several schools, and has also a village and some out-stations.\n\nThe soils vary from a deep black loam 10 feet or more in depth to a thin red or yellow soil only an inch or two thick. Good black or brown soil covers about 23 per cent. of the cultivated area, and inferior gravelly or sandy soil the rest. In the Sausar tahsil the shallow brown soil, when manured, produces excellent crops of cotton and jow\u0101r. Where the country is undulating,\nrich black clay is found in the depressions, brown loam on the slopes, and a thin covering of stony red earth on the ridges, while the open plains of Chaurai and Mohkher consist of stretches of deep black soil. The band of crystalline rock running through the east of Chhindw\u0101ra produces the yellow soil which is suitable for rice, and a little of this is also found in Sausar. In the j\u0101girs the land is generally of the poorest quality.\n\nAn area of 1,597 square miles is comprised in the ten j\u0101gird\u0101ri estates, 92 square miles are held wholly or partially free of revenue, 5,000 acres have been sold outright under the Waste Land Rules, and 55 square miles have been disforested and are being settled on the ryotw\u0101ri tenure. The remainder of the village area is held on the ordinary m\u0101lguz\u0101ri tenure. The following table gives the principal statistics of cultivation in 1903\u20134, areas being in square miles:\n\n| Tahsil | Total | Cultivated | Irrigated | Cultivable waste | Forests |\n|--------|-------|------------|-----------|------------------|---------|\n| Chhindw\u0101ra | 3,528 | 1,267 | 8 | 1,106 | 381 |\n| Sausar | 1,103 | 437 | 3 | 177 | 331 |\n| Total | 4,631 | 1,704 | 10 | 1,283 | 712 |\n\nThere is still considerable room for extension of cultivation, but the land remaining to be brought under the plough is usually of very poor quality. At present nearly 25 per cent. of the occupied area is under old or new fallow, but this proportion is abnormal, the usual figure being about 19 per cent. Resting fallows are frequently given in every alternate year on the poorest soils. The principal crops now are wheat, covering 308 square miles, and jow\u0101r, which is grown by itself or mixed with the pulse arhar (Cajanus indicus), and occupies 280 square miles. Next in importance are the small millets kodon and kutki with an area of 199 square miles; and the oilseeds til and jagnt, 185 square miles. A noticeable feature in the returns of the past few years is the great increase in the popularity of jow\u0101r, which has partially replaced wheat as the staple food-grain of the District. Sugar-cane was formerly an important product, but in 1903\u20134 only 1,600 acres were planted with it.\n\nDuring the thirty years up to 1893 the cropped area increased by 43 per cent., while in the next ten years a further rise of 11 per cent. took place. The area under the valuable cotton crop expanded from 55 square miles in 1894 to 143 in 1904. San-hemp (Crotalaria juncea), which has recently become a very profitable crop, covers 10,000 acres. Only Rs. 8,000 was advanced under the Land Improvement Loans Act during the ten years ending 1904, and 1.71 lakhs under the Agriculturists' Loans Act.\nCattle are bred principally in the Khamarp\u0101ni tract in the east of the District, and on the banks of the Kanhan river near Bhatoria. The Khamarp\u0101ni breed are large and handsome animals, with high foreheads, white in colour, and good trotters. They are bred by professional herdsmen, and great care is exercised in the selection of bulls, which cost about Rs. 150 apiece. The bullocks are used for cultivation in heavy black soil, and also for drawing the light chhakr\u0101s or travelling carts. The Kanhan river oxen are smaller, and of different colours\u2014red, black, and speckled. They are used generally for cultivation in hilly and stony land. The trotting cattle kept by the richer landholders are bought as yearlings, and kept carefully until they are two or three years old, being allowed to graze freely in the standing crops, and fed liberally when these are not on the ground. A good pair will cover 50 miles in ten hours, and races are held annually at Taegaon Khairi near Borgaon. Buffaloes are bred to a small extent, but only for the sake of their milk, and are not used for cultivation. The young bulls are generally neglected, and allowed to die. Goats and sheep are bred by G\u0101dris and also by Ahirs and Khatiks, for food, for their wool, and for the supply of manure. The males only are eaten as food, and many castes will not eat sheep at all. They are very highly prized for manure in the Sausar tahsil, where they are folded on the cotton-fields.\n\nThe only crops that are irrigated are vegetables, spices, and sugar-cane, and very rarely wheat. Such irrigation as exists is carried on from wells, or in rare cases from water-holes dug at the foot of a bank overhanging a stream. There are more than 4,000 temporary and 400 masonry wells, which irrigate about 7,000 acres. Some projects for tanks have been prepared by the Irrigation department.\n\nThe Government forests cover an area of 712 square miles, of which 663 are 'reserved,' and the remainder has been assigned for deforestation and colonization. Pure teak forest is found only in a few small and scattered patches, but teak mixed with inferior trees occurs on the hills of the Silew\u0101ni and Amb\u0101ra ranges. Bamboos are found in these forests and their reproduction is good. The greater part of the forests consists of s\u0101j (Terminalia tomentosa) mixed with other trees, while a considerable area contains inferior species, in which reproduction is very poor, and no protection is attempted. The propagation of the lac insect has been taken in hand as a forest industry and is proceeding successfully. The extraction of r\u016bsa oil from the grass called tik\u0101ri (Andropogon Schoenanthus) for purposes of export has also commenced. The forest revenue in 1903-4 amounted to Rs. 79,000, of which Rs. 19,000 was realized from sales of timber, Rs. 24,000 from grazing, and Rs. 8,000 from minor produce. The j\u0101gird\u0101ri forests do not contain much valuable timber.\n\nThe Pench and Kanhan coal-fields lie from east to west in the hill\ncountry about 12 miles north of Chhindw\u0101ra town. Mining leases have been granted and an extension of the railway to the local fields has been completed. An analysis of the coal shows 62 per cent. of fixed carbon, 28 per cent. of volatile matter, and 10.4 per cent. of ash; and the prospects of the field are very promising. Manganese has been found in several villages in the Sausar tahsil on the hills bordering K\u0101tol, and also below the gh\u0101ts; and prospecting and mining leases have been taken out.\n\nThere are colonies of cotton weavers in all the towns and several of the larger villages, who produce moderately fine cloth. At Norhi\u0101 Karw\u0101l, near Chhindw\u0101ra town, head-cloths are woven from threads of counts as fine as 100's. Mill-spun thread is now solely used, with the exception that the G\u0101dris or shepherd caste spin a stout blue and white thread from which sacks are made for holding grain. Tasar silk is produced and woven locally to a small extent. The G\u0101dris also weave blankets in different colours, the wool being dyed with lac and imported dyes. S\u0101n-hemp is grown principally for export, but hemp matting is also woven by Banj\u0101ras for local use. Ropes made of the grass called k\u0101mi or hoy\u0101 are largely used by all classes for household purposes. Brass utensils are made at Chhindw\u0101ra and Lodhikhed\u0101; but the industry is not flourishing, and the Chhindw\u0101ra brass-workers have taken up the manufacture of zinc ornaments as a subsidiary occupation. The largest market in the District is that of R\u0101makon\u0101 on the Chhindw\u0101ra-N\u0101gpur road, 50 miles from N\u0101gpur, where as many as 3,000 carts are collected on a bazar day in the season. Lodhikhed\u0101 and P\u0101ndhurn\u0101 are the markets next in importance, and after them Palatw\u0101da, Mor-dongri, and Mohkher. A cotton-ginning factory at Mohgaon has been working since 1892, with a capital of Rs. 50,000. Two gins were opened at P\u0101ndhurn\u0101 in 1903, and a cotton-press is being constructed.\n\nWheat, cotton, oilseeds, and s\u0101n-hemp are the principal exports of agricultural produce. Gur (unrefined sugar) is sent to Ber\u0101r and N\u0101gpur, but in decreasing quantities. Potatoes and ginger are supplied to N\u0101gpur and Seoni, and timber, minor forest produce, hides and horns, and manganese are other articles of export. Salt comes from Gujar\u0101t through Pipari\u0101 to Chhindw\u0101ra, and from Bombay through N\u0101gpur to Sausar. Mauritius sugar is generally used. English and Indian mill-woven cotton cloths are worn in large villages and towns, and hand-woven cloths in rural tracts. Iron, brass, and other metals and hardware are imported from Bombay through N\u0101gpur. The trade of the District is conducted by M\u0101rw\u0101ri Bani\u0101s and Cutch\u012b Muhammadans. Telis act as local carriers, purchasing grain and other goods and taking them to R\u0101makon\u0101 market for sale to the N\u0101gpur agents.\n\nThe District has till recently not been touched by the railway; but\na branch of the S\u0101tpur\u0101 extension of the Bengal-N\u0101gpur line through Seoni to Chhindw\u0101ra town was opened in 1905, with a length of 29 miles and three stations in the District. A short extension of the line to the coal-fields north of Chhindw\u0101ra has also been constructed. Metalled roads lead from Chhindw\u0101ra to N\u0101gpur through Sausar, a distance of 80 miles, and to Seoni, 43 miles. Other roads are those to Pipari\u0101 station on the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, to Narsinghpur, and to Multai in Bet\u016bl District. The principal outlet for trade is the N\u0101gpur road, and next to this the Jubbulpore road through Seoni. The District has 137 miles of metalled and 210 miles of unmetalled roads, and the annual expenditure on maintenance is Rs. 68,000. The Public Works department has charge of 269 miles of road, and the District council of 78 miles. There are avenues of trees on 31 miles.\n\nThe only years in which failures of crops sufficiently serious to cause distress have been recorded were 1868-9, 1896-7, and 1899-1900. During the first two of these Chhindw\u0101ra fared better than most other parts of the Province. In 1868, the year of the Bundelkhand famine, there was but slight distress, while in 1896 the only crops that completely failed were the small millets on which the hill tribes subsist. Distress was mainly confined to the j\u0101g\u012br estates and the western portion of the Chhindw\u0101ra tahsil. The maximum number on relief in October, 1897, was about 24,000, and the expenditure 5.7 lakhs. In 1899-1900 there was a general failure of crops, with the exception of cotton, which gave a fair out-turn. More than 70,000 persons, or 17 per cent. of the population, were being relieved in May, 1900, and the total expenditure was 16 lakhs. A large number of village tanks were constructed or repaired; and the relief works also included the construction of some forest roads, the raising of the embankment for the new line of railway, and various improvements to the main road communications of the District.\n\nThe Deputy-Commissioner is aided by one Assistant or Extra-Assistant Commissioner. For administrative purposes the District is divided into two tahsils, Chhindw\u0101ra and Sausar, each of which has a tahsild\u0101r and a naib-tahsild\u0101r. A Forest officer of the Imperial service is usually posted to the District.\n\nThe civil judicial staff consists of a District and a Subordinate Judge, and a Munsif for each tahsil. The Divisional and Sessions Judge of the Nerbudda Division has superior civil and criminal jurisdiction. The crime of the District is not heavy, and the civil litigation is of the ordinary type.\n\nThe share of the revenue left to the p\u0101tel or manager of the village by the Mar\u0101th\u0101 administration was usually only about 15 per cent. of the 'assets.' Out of this, moreover, he had to remunerate the village\nservants, and make certain charitable payments and allowances, while he was also liable at any time to be called upon to pay an extra cess, over and above the regular revenue. During the latter period of Mar\u0101\u1e6dh\u0101 rule their territories were mercilessly rack-rented, in the endeavour to raise their total revenue to the figure at which it had stood before they had been obliged to cede Orissa and Ber\u0101r by the Treaty of Deogaon. The District was thus in a very impoverished condition when it was taken over by the British in 1853. Triennial settlements were made for ten years, the Government share, in continuation of previous practice, being fixed at about 80 per cent. of the 'assets.' Between 1863 and 1867 a thirty years' settlement was made, the Government demand being approximately 66 per cent. of the prospective 'assets.' This resulted in a reduction of the existing revenue by about 9 per cent., and the demand was finally fixed at 2\u00b714 lakhs. At this settlement the village headmen, who had previously held the position of managers or farmers, received proprietary and transferable rights in their villages. During the currency of the thirty years' settlement the cropped area increased by 41 per cent., and it was calculated that the prices of agricultural produce had doubled. The District was resettled between 1891 and 1895 for a period varying from fourteen to seventeen years. The revised demand was fixed at 2\u00b797 lakhs, of which Rs. 6,000 is 'assigned,' giving an increase of 37 per cent. on the former demand, and falling at 55 per cent. on the actual 'assets.' The average revenue incidence per acre was R. 0-5-11 (maximum R. 0-10-11, minimum R. 0-2-2), and the rental incidence R. 0-9-9 (maximum Rs. 1-0-7, minimum R. 0-4-0).\n\nThe receipts of land revenue and total revenue for a series of years are shown below, in thousands of rupees:\n\n|                | 1880-1 | 1890-1 | 1900-1 | 1903-4 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Land revenue   | 2,21   | 2,21   | 3,68   | 3,97   |\n| Total revenue  | 3,84   | 5,07   | 6,47   | 6,80   |\n\nThe management of local affairs, outside municipal areas, is entrusted to a District council and three local boards, including one for the j\u0101girs. The income of the District council in 1903-4 was Rs. 44,000, while the expenditure on education was Rs. 18,000 and on public works Rs. 11,000. Chhindw\u0101ra, Sausar, and P\u0101ndhurn\u0101 are municipal towns.\n\nThe force under the District Superintendent of police consists of 322 officers and men, including 3 mounted constables, besides 1,541 watchmen for 1,755 towns and inhabited villages. The police administration in the j\u0101girs has recently been taken under direct supervision. Chhindw\u0101ra town has a District jail, with accommodation for 121\nprisoners, including 9 females. The daily average number in 1904 was 52.\n\nIn respect of education Chhindw\u0101ra stands tenth among the Districts of the Province, 2.2 per cent. of the population (4.5 males and 0.1 females) being able to read and write. The proportion of children under instruction to those of school-going age is 8 per cent. Statistics of the number of pupils are as follows: (1880-1) 1,749, (1890-1) 2,181, (1900-1) 3,094, (1903-4) 4,974, including 102 girls. The educational institutions comprise an English middle school at Chhindw\u0101ra, five vernacular middle schools, and 63 primary schools. The expenditure on education in 1903-4 was Rs. 30,000, of which Rs. 20,000 was derived from Provincial and Local funds and Rs. 2,000 from fees.\n\nThe District has four dispensaries, with accommodation for 34 in-patients. In 1904 the number of cases treated was 25,288, of whom 362 were in-patients, and 883 operations were performed. The total expenditure was Rs. 6,000.\n\nVaccination is compulsory only in the municipal areas of Chhindw\u0101ra, Sausar, and P\u0101ndhurn\u0101, and in the towns of Lodhikhed\u0101 and Mohgaon. The number of persons successfully vaccinated in 1903-4 was 47 per 1,000 of the District population, a high proportion.\n\n[C. W. Montgomerie, Settlement Report (1899). A District Gazetteer is being prepared.]\n\nChhindw\u0101ra Tahsil.\u2014Northern tahsil of Chhindw\u0101ra District, Central Provinces, lying between 21\u00b0 46' and 22\u00b0 49' N. and 78\u00b0 10' and 79\u00b0 24' E., with an area of 3,528 square miles. The population in 1901 was 286,779, compared with 287,043 in 1891. The density is 81 persons per square mile. The tahsil contains one town, Chhindw\u0101ra (population, 9,736), the tahsil and District head-quarters; and 1,368 inhabited villages. The demand for land revenue in 1903-4 was Rs. 1,78,000, and for cesses Rs. 24,000. The tahsil consists of an upland plateau broken by small hills, which forms the m\u0101lguz\u0101r\u012b tract or that held on the ordinary proprietary tenure, and of a mass of higher hill and forest country which forms the estates of ten j\u0101gird\u0101rs or hereditary chieftains, covering 1,597 square miles to the north. Excluding 381 square miles of Government forest and the j\u0101gir area of 1,597 square miles, 68 per cent. of the remaining m\u0101lguz\u0101r\u012b area is occupied for cultivation. The cultivated area of the whole tahsil in 1903-4 was 1,267 square miles. Of the area included in the j\u0101gir, 495 square miles are forest.\n\nChhindw\u0101ra Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the District and tahsil of the same name, Central Provinces, situated in 22\u00b0 4' N. and 78\u00b0 57' E., on the Bodri, 80 miles from N\u0101gpur by road. A branch narrow-gauge line of the Bengal-N\u0101gpur Railway was opened to Chhindw\u0101ra in 1905. The town stands on the S\u0101tpur\u0101 plateau at an elevation of 2,200 feet, and possesses a pleasant and healthy climate. The name is derived\nfrom the *chhind* or bastard date-palms which are found in the vicinity. Chhindw\u0101ra is said to have been founded by one Ratan Raghuwansi, who let loose a goat, and on the place where it lay down built a house, burying the goat alive beneath the foundations. The goat is worshipped as the tutelary deity of the town. Population (1901), 9,736. Chhindw\u0101ra was created a municipality in 1867. The municipal receipts during the decade ending 1901 averaged Rs. 13,000. In 1903-4 the income was Rs. 17,000, the principal head of receipt being octroi. The town is a centre for local trade, and the handicrafts carried on include the manufacture of pottery and cotton hand-weaving. A small quantity of *tasar* silk is woven. There is a printing press, which publishes a monthly magazine in Hindi. Three weekly markets are held for the sale of cattle, timber, and grain. Chhindw\u0101ra possesses an English middle school and branch school, a private school teaching Arabic, and two dispensaries, including a police hospital. A station of the Swedish Lutheran Mission has been established here.\n\n**Chhindw\u0101ra Town.**\u2014Town in the District and *tahsil* of Narsinghpur, Central Provinces, situated in $23^\\circ 2' \\text{N.}$ and $79^\\circ 29' \\text{E.}$, on the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, 583 miles from Bombay. Population (1901), 4,216. Chhindw\u0101ra is on the old trunk road to the Deccan, and was established in 1824 by Sir W. Sleeman for the convenience of travellers through the Narbad\u0101 valley, at the time when this road was infested by Thags. It was created a municipality in 1867. The municipal receipts during the decade ending 1901 averaged Rs. 4,400. In 1903-4 the income was Rs. 4,700, derived mainly from fees on the registration of cattle. Produce from the adjoining tracts is brought to Chhindw\u0101ra station for export, and an important weekly cattle market is held here at which more than 1,000 head change hands. A cotton-ginning factory has been erected.

See CHOT\u0100 SINCHUL\u0100.\n\n**Chhoti S\u0101dri.**\u2014Head-quarters of a *zila* or district of the same name in the State of Udaipur, R\u0101jput\u0101na, situated in $24^\\circ 23' \\text{N.}$ and $74^\\circ 43' \\text{E.}$, about 66 miles east-by-south-east of Udaipur city. The town is walled and contains (1901) 5,050 inhabitants. It possesses a post office, a primary vernacular school attended by about 110 boys, and a dispensary. The Chhoti S\u0101dri *zila* is the most fertile in the State, the soil being for the most part black cotton.\n\n**Chhuikhad\u0101n** (or Kondk\u0101).\u2014Feudatory State in the Central Pro-\nvinces, lying between $21^\\circ 30'$ and $21^\\circ 38'$ N. and $80^\\circ 53'$ and $81^\\circ 11'$ E. This small State consists of three detached blocks and a single village lying in the rich tract of black soil at the foot of the eastern range of the S\u0101tpur\u0101 Hills, surrounded by the Khair\u0101garh and N\u0101ndgaon States and the zamind\u0101ris of Drug District. The total area is 154 square miles, almost the whole of which is a fertile cultivated plain. The head-quarters, Chhuikhad\u0101n ('the quarry of white clay'), is situated 31 miles from both the R\u0101j-N\u0101ndgaon and Dongargarh stations of the Bengal-N\u0101gpur Railway, the road to Chhuikhad\u0101n being through Khair\u0101garh. Its population in 1901 was 2,085. The ruling family belongs to a sect of Bair\u0101gis among whom marriage is permitted, and the succession is determined by the ordinary law of primogeniture. The nucleus of the State was formerly the Kondk\u0101 tract of the Parpod\u012b zamind\u0101ri, which was acquired from the zamind\u0101r in satisfaction of a loan by Mahant R\u016bp D\u0101s, the founder of the Chhuikhad\u0101n family, about the middle of the eighteenth century. His successor, Tulsi D\u0101s, was recognized by the Bhonsla R\u0101ja of N\u0101gpur as zamind\u0101r of Kondk\u0101 about 1780, and the status of Feudatory chief was conferred on the family in 1865. In 1867, on the accession of Mahant Sh\u0101m Kishor D\u0101s, who had for some years previously been virtual ruler, the chief was required, in consequence of his tyrannous behaviour to the headmen of villages, to conduct the administration with the advice of a Diw\u0101n appointed by Government. Sh\u0101m Kishor D\u0101s died in 1896, and his son and successor, R\u0101dha Ballabh Kishor D\u0101s, was poisoned two years later, together with one of his sons, by arsenic administered by a relative. The offender and his accomplice were convicted by a special court and executed; and the eldest son, Digbijai Jugal Kishor D\u0101s, a boy of fifteen years of age, succeeded, the estate being managed by Government during his minority. This boy, who was very weakly, died in 1903, and was succeeded by his younger brother, Bh\u016bdav Kishor D\u0101s, aged fourteen years, who is being educated at the R\u0101jkum\u0101r College, Raipur. The population of the State in 1901 was 26,368, having decreased by 27 per cent. in the previous decade, during which Chhuikhad\u0101n was severely affected by famine. The number of inhabited villages is 107, and the density of population 171 persons per square mile. Gonds, Lodhis, Telis, and Ahirs are the principal castes, and the whole population speaks the Chhattisgarh dialect of Hindi.\n\nThe State contains a large area of fertile black soil, and 114 square miles, or 74 per cent. of the total area, were occupied for cultivation in 1904, of which 104 were under crops. Kodon covers 53 square miles of the cropped area, wheat 19 square miles, and rice 9,000 acres. The State forests comprise an area of only 15 square miles, and except for a little teak contain no valuable timber. The gravelled road from Dongargarh to Pandari\u0101 passes through Chhuikhad\u0101n, and the length\nof 15 miles within its borders was constructed and is maintained from State funds.\n\nThe total revenue in 1904 was Rs. 73,000, of which Rs. 56,000 was derived from land, Rs. 2,000 from forests, and Rs. 4,000 from excise. The incidence of land revenue is 11 annas 4 pies per cultivated acre. The total expenditure in the same year was Rs. 76,000, the principal items being Government tribute (Rs. 15,000), allowances to the ruling family (Rs. 7,300), general administration (Rs. 7,000), and public works (Rs. 26,000). Seven schools with 572 pupils are supported from the State funds, including a vernacular middle school at Chhulikhadan. The expenditure on education is about Rs. 2,000. In 1901 the number of persons returned as literate was 468, the proportion of males able to read and write being 3.6 per cent. A dispensary is maintained at Chhulikhadan, at which about 4,800 persons were treated in 1904. The administration of the State is supervised by a Political Agent under the Commissioner, Chhattisgarh Division.\n\nChicacole Subdivision.\u2014Subdivision of Ganjam District, Madras, consisting of the taluk of Chicacole and the samindari tahsils of Narasannapeta, Parlakimedi, and Tekkali.\n\nChicacole Taluk.\u2014Southernmost of the three Government taluks in Ganjam District, Madras, lying between 18\u00b0 12' and 18\u00b0 40' N. and 83\u00b0 51' and 84\u00b0 18' E., with an area of 373 square miles. The population in 1901 was 223,373, compared with 212,608 in 1891. They live in 305 villages and two towns, Chicacole (population, 18,196), the head-quarters, and Narasannapeta (7,886). The demand for land revenue and cesses in 1903-4 was Rs. 4,16,500. The 'wet' land of a large portion of the taluk is irrigated by river channels from the Langulya and the Vamsadhira.\n\nChicacole Town (Srikakulam).\u2014Head-quarters of the subdivision and taluk of the same name in Ganjam District, Madras, situated in 18\u00b0 17' N. and 83\u00b0 53' E., on the left bank of the Langulya 4 miles from its mouth, and on the trunk road 567 miles from Madras and 422 miles from Calcutta, and 9 miles from the station of Chicacole Road on the East Coast Railway. Population (1901), 18,196.\n\nWhen the Musalmans ruled this part of the country it was the capital of the Chicacole Sarkar, one of the five Northern Circars. A notable memorial of their dominion is the handsome mosque built in 1641 from the materials of a demolished Hindu temple by Sher Muhammad Khan, the first Faujdar, or military governor, under the Kutb Shahi dynasty of Golconda. When the English occupied the country it was for many years an important military station, and was also for a time the civil head-quarters of the District and, until 1865, the residence of the District Judge. In 1791 the town was nearly depopulated by famine, and it again suffered severely from scarcity in 1866 and in 1877.\nIn 1876 a furious cyclone swept over this part of the District and the L\u00e4ngulya came down in heavy flood. Trees and other d\u00e9bris choked the arches of the fine masonry bridge on which the trunk road crosses it at the town, and at the same time a great storm wave rushed up the river from the sea. The six centre arches of the bridge collapsed in consequence. They were afterwards rebuilt.\n\nChicacole is a very straggling town, with several outlying villages. It enjoys a good climate. Now that the railway passes so far away it is declining in importance. It was constituted a municipality in 1867. The municipal receipts and expenditure varied but little during the ten years ending 1902-3, averaging Rs. 27,000. In 1903-4 they amounted to Rs. 31,000, the chief source of income being the taxes on houses and lands, school-fees, and tolls. The council maintains a high school, which had an average daily attendance of 255 boys in 1903-4 and sends up candidates for matriculation. The place possesses a town hall constructed from public subscriptions, and a public library, the gift of Rao Bahadur T. V. Siva Rao Pantulu G\u0101ru. Chicacole is known for the fine muslins and durable checks woven in it. Its muslins were at one time as famous as those of Dacca or Arni; but the industry has suffered from the competition of machine-made fabrics, and the finer kinds are now only made to order.\n\n**Chidambaram Subdivision.**\u2014Subdivision of South Arcot District, Madras, consisting of the taluks of Chidambaram and Vriddh\u0101chalam.\n\n**Chidambaram Taluk.**\u2014Southern taluk of South Arcot District, Madras, lying between 11\u00b0 11' and 11\u00b0 30' N. and 79\u00b0 19' and 79\u00b0 49' E., with an area of 402 square miles. The Coleroon bounds it on the south, separating it from Tanjore, and the river Vell\u0101k runs across it; thus, unlike the rest of the District, it contains wide irrigated areas watered by large works from these rivers. The channels from the Lower Anicut across the Coleroon supply about 246 villages. The population in 1901 was 294,868, compared with 282,275 in 1891. It contains 336 villages and two towns: namely, Chidambaram (population, 19,909), a municipality and the head-quarters of the taluk, and Porto Novo (13,712), a seaport. The demand for land revenue and cesses amounted in 1903-4 to Rs. 9,33,000. The density of population is as high as 734 persons per square mile, the District average being 450; and the annual rainfall, which is about 51 inches, is heavier than in any other taluk.\n\n**Chidambaram Town** (Chit Ambalam, 'the atmosphere of wisdom').\u2014Head-quarters of the taluk of the same name in South Arcot District, Madras, situated in 11\u00b0 25' N. and 79\u00b0 42' E., on the South Indian Railway. The population in 1901 was 19,909, of whom 18,627 were Hindus and 1,199 Musalmans. A municipality was constituted\nin 1873. The receipts and expenditure during the ten years ending 1902-3 averaged Rs. 24,800 and Rs. 25,100 respectively. In 1903-4 they were Rs. 25,800 and Rs. 27,600, the former consisting chiefly of the proceeds of the taxes on houses and land. An estimate for a water-supply amounting to Rs. 2,82,000 is now under consideration.\n\nDuring the Carnatic Wars Chidambaram was a place of considerable strategic importance. In 1749 the ill-fated expedition under Captain Cope against Devikottai halted here on its retreat to Fort St. David. In 1753 the French occupied it. In 1759 an attempt by the English failed, but it capitulated to Major Monson in 1760. Later on, Haidar Ali improved the defences and placed a garrison in the great temple. In 1781 Sir Eyre Coote attacked the temple, but was driven off.\n\nChidambaram is principally famous for its great Siva temple. This covers an area of 39 acres in the heart of the town, and is surrounded on all four sides by streets about 60 feet wide. It contains one of the five great lingams, namely, the 'air lingam,' which is known also as the Chidambara Rahasyam or the 'secret of Chidambaram.' No lingam actually exists; but a curtain is hung before a wall, and when visitors enter the curtain is withdrawn and the wall exhibited, the 'lingam of air' being, of course, invisible. The temple is held in the highest reverence throughout Southern India and Ceylon, and one of the annual festivals held in December and January is largely attended by pilgrims from all parts of India. As an architectural edifice it is a wonderful structure, for it stands in the middle of an alluvial plain between two rivers where there is no building stone within 40 miles; and yet the outer walls are faced with dressed granite, the whole of the great area enclosed by the inner walls is paved with stone, the temple contains a hall which stands on more than 1,000 monolithic pillars, into the gateways are built blocks of stone 30 feet high and more than 3 feet square, and the reservoir, which is 150 feet long and 100 feet broad and very deep, has long flights of stone steps leading down to the water on all four sides. The labour expended in bringing all this and other material 40 miles through a country without roads and across the Vell\u00e4r river must have been enormous.\n\nThe temple contains five Sabhas or halls, besides shrines to Vishnu and Ganesa. Its age and architecture are discussed at some length in Fergusson's History of Indian Architecture, which also contains several woodcuts of different parts of it. The N\u00e4ttukottai subdivision of the Chetti caste have recently been restoring the building at considerable cost. It possesses no landed endowments, and is managed in a most unusual way by the members of a sect of Br\u0101hmans called Dikshitaras, who are peculiar to Chidambaram and depend entirely upon public offerings for their own maintenance and for the upkeep of the temple. The management may be described as a domestic hierarchy, each male\nmarried member of the sect possessing an equal share in its control. No accounts are kept. The Dikshitars take it in turns to perform the daily worship. Except the temple, the place contains little of interest. There is a resthouse built by a Nattukottai Chetti in which poor pilgrims are fed daily, and many other resthouses provide accommodation for travellers. A high school in the town is managed by the trustees of the well-known Pachayyappa charities.\n\nChikalda.\u2014Sanitarium in the Melghat taluk, Amraoti District, Berar, situated in $21^\\circ 24'$ N. and $77^\\circ 22'$ E., on a plateau in the Satpur Hills, about 5 miles in length and three-quarters of a mile broad, 3,664 feet above the sea; distant about a mile and a half from Gavilgarh fort and rather less than 20 miles from Ellichpur. Chikalda is connected with Ellichpur by three roads, one of which, 30 miles in length, is suitable for carriages. At Ghata, about half-way between Ellichpur and Chikalda, is a travellers' bungalow, which is an agreeable resting-place. There is no tonga service between Ellichpur and Chikalda, and travellers must make their own arrangements with the tahsildar at the former place for carriage. Chikalda has been a favourite Berar sanitarium since 1839, when the first bungalows were built on the plateau by officers of the Ellichpur Brigade. The heads of departments in Berar spend a portion of the hot season at Chikalda, which is also the head-quarters of the Conservator of Forests and of the tahsildar of the Melghat. The climate, though not to be compared with that of sanitaria at higher elevations in the Himalayas and Nilgiris, is equable, cool, and bracing. The mean temperature in May, July, and December, which may be selected as typical of the hot, rainy, and cold seasons, is $86^\\circ$, $75^\\circ$, and $65^\\circ$. The scenery is beautiful, and the vegetation luxuriant and varied in character\u2014roses, clematis, orchids, ferns, and lilies succeeding each other with the changing seasons. Balsams, zinnias, wild ginger, and orchis also abound. Excellent potatoes were formerly grown at Chikalda, and tea might possibly be grown, though not in quantities sufficient to justify the exploitation of the limited area of the Chikalda plateau. The coffee grown in private gardens is of excellent quality; and the plateau, if brought under cultivation, could doubtless supply vegetables for a European community larger than that which is now accommodated in the twelve houses in Chikalda, and in a hotel. At Mariampur, near Chikalda, the Order of St. Francis of Sales has a mission.\n\nChik-Ballapur Taluk.\u2014Western taluk of Kolur District, Mysore, lying between $13^\\circ 20'$ and $13^\\circ 40'$ N. and $77^\\circ 36'$ and $77^\\circ 52'$ E., with an area of 250 square miles. The population in 1901 was 56,057, compared with 51,592 in 1891. The taluk contains one town, Chik-Ballapur (population, 5,521), the head-quarters; and 266 villages. The land revenue demand in 1903-4 was Rs. 96,000. This is a\nmountainous taluk, the Nandidroog range running along the west from south to north, with the head-waters of seven rivers. The soil in the south-east is of great fertility, specially favourable for the cultivation of sugar-cane. The north-east abounds in deep ravines and broken ground.\n\nChik-Ballapur Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the taluk of the same name in Kol\u0101r District, Mysore, situated in $13^\\circ 26'$ N. and $77^\\circ 44'$ E., 22 miles north-east of Dod-Ballapur railway station. Population (1901), 5,521, a decrease from 10,623 in 1891, owing chiefly to plague. Chikka or Little Ballapur is so called to distinguish it from Dodd\u0101 or Great Ballapur. It is at the eastern base of the Nandidroog range, and was founded about 1479 by a chief of the Morasu Wokkaliga refugees at Avati. In this family it continued, being tributary to Vijayanagar, until taken by Haidar Ali. The London Mission have an out-station here. There is a native iron foundry, and the silk industry is largely pursued. The municipality dates from 1870. The receipts and expenditure during the ten years ending 1901 averaged Rs. 8,100 and Rs. 7,700. In 1903-4 they were Rs. 11,000 and Rs. 10,000. A light railway has been proposed to connect Chik-Ballapur with Bangalore.\n\nChikhli Taluk.\u2014Taluk of Buld\u0101na District, Ber\u0101r, lying between $20^\\circ$ and $20^\\circ 37'$ N. and $75^\\circ 57'$ and $76^\\circ 42'$ E., with an area of 1,009 square miles. The population fell from 150,098 in 1891 to 129,590 in 1901, the density in the latter year being 128 persons per square mile. The taluk contains 269 villages and three towns: Chikhli (population, 5,889), the head-quarters, De\u016blgaon R\u0101j\u0101 (6,293), and Buld\u0101na (4,137), the head-quarters of the District. The demand for land revenue in 1903-4 was Rs. 3,37,000, and for cesses Rs. 26,000. The taluk lies entirely in the B\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t or southern plateau of Ber\u0101r, but contains a large proportion of fertile land, especially in the valleys of the streams, where wheat is cultivated with success.\n\nChikhli Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the taluk of the same name in Buld\u0101na District, Ber\u0101r, situated in $20^\\circ 21'$ N. and $76^\\circ 18'$ E. Population (1901), 5,889. Metalled roads run to Buld\u0101na and Mehkar, and the town is a centre of local trade.\n\nChikhli.\u2014Eastern taluka of Surat District, Bombay, lying between $20^\\circ 37'$ and $20^\\circ 54'$ N. and $72^\\circ 59'$ and $73^\\circ 17'$ E., with an area of 168 square miles. The population in 1901 was 59,692, compared with 61,315 in 1891. The taluka contains 61 villages and one town, Chikhli (population, 4,440), the head-quarters. Land revenue and cesses amounted in 1903-4 to 2.3 lakhs. Chikhli consists of raised plateaux with intervening belts of low-lying land. The elevated tracts are seamed by rocky watercourses. The soil, being poor and shallow, is cultivated only in patches, and yields little but grass and brushwood. The low-lying lands between these elevations contain a very fertile soil, bearing superior crops of grain, sugar-cane, and fruit. The taluka is watered by\nthe Ambika, K\u0101veri, Kharera, and Auranga rivers, which flow through it from east to west.\n\n**Chikhli.\u2014** Estate in Kh\u0101ndesh District, Bombay. *See Mehw\u0101s Estates.*\n\n**Chikmugal\u016br T\u0101luk.\u2014** Central t\u0101luk of Kad\u016br District, Mysore, lying between $13^\\circ 11'$ and $13^\\circ 34'$ N. and $75^\\circ 29'$ and $76^\\circ 1'$ E., with an area of 638 square miles. The population in 1901 was 90,681, compared with 77,630 in 1891. The t\u0101luk contains one town, Chikmugal\u016br (population, 9,515), the head-quarters; and 235 villages. The land revenue demand in 1903\u20134 was Rs. 2,13,000. The north is occupied by the lofty forest-clad circle of the B\u0101b\u0101 Budan Mountains (highest peak, Mulainagiri, 6,317 feet), enclosing the J\u0101gar valley. The Bhadra, flowing north, forms most of the western boundary. The annual rainfall averages 36 inches. Around Chikmugal\u016br is an elevated tract of rich black soil, watered by perennial streams from the B\u0101b\u0101 Budans, the principal being the Yagachi, which runs south-east. Its fertility was such that it was called Honjavanige, or \u2018flowing with gold.\u2019 It is bare of trees, but produces unfailing crops of wheat, Bengal gram, sugar-cane, rice, coriander, fenugreek, garlic, onions, and safflower. The west of the t\u0101luk forms part of the Malnad. There are many coffee plantations on the slopes of the B\u0101b\u0101 Budans.\n\n**Chikmugal\u016br Town.\u2014** Head-quarters of the t\u0101luk of the same name in Kad\u016br District, Mysore, situated in $13^\\circ 19'$ N. and $75^\\circ 46'$ E., 25 miles south-west of Kad\u016br railway station. Population (1901), 9,515. It stands in the fertile valley of black soil south of the B\u0101b\u0101 Budan range, and has increased enormously since the removal hither of the District head-quarters from Kad\u016br in 1865. The fort was in existence in the ninth century under the Ganga kings, and then passed to the Hoysalas. The modern town, extending from the fort to Basavanhalli, which it includes, was established in 1865; and a number of Muhammadan traders and shopkeepers have settled here, who supply the wants of the coffee plantations to the west. The water-supply is drawn from a tank at the foot of the B\u0101b\u0101 Budans. The municipality dates from 1870. The receipts and expenditure during the ten years ending 1901 averaged Rs. 30,000 and Rs. 29,000. In 1903\u20134 they were Rs. 22,000 and Rs. 31,000.\n\n**Chikn\u0101yakanhalli T\u0101luk.\u2014** Western t\u0101luk of Tumk\u016br District, Mysore, including Huliyar as a sub-t\u0101luk till 1902, and lying between $13^\\circ 19'$ and $13^\\circ 44'$ N. and $76^\\circ 21'$ and $76^\\circ 45'$ E., with an area of 532 square miles. The population in 1901 was 60,071, compared with 50,760 in 1891. An area of 97 square miles was transferred to the District of Chitaldroog in 1902\u20133. The t\u0101luk contains two towns, Chikn\u0101yakanhalli (population, 6,113), the head-quarters, and Huliyar (1,228); and 278 villages. The land revenue demand in 1903\u20134\nwas Rs. 1,19,000. From east to north the taluk is crossed by low bare hills of the Chiknayakanhalli auriferous band. Humidity from fogs which form on the hills often preserves the crops from failure in dry seasons. The drainage is northwards to the Vedavati or Hagari. In the north-east the large Borankanave tank has been formed by damming a gorge in the hills. Coco-nut and areca-nut plantations abound in the taluk. Gold-mining has been experimentally begun at Bellara in the north.\n\nChiknayakanhalli Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the taluk of the same name in Tumkur District, Mysore, situated in 13\u00b0 25' N. and 76\u00b0 37' E., 12 miles north of Banasandra railway station. Population (1901), 6,113. It is named after Chikka Naik, one of the Hagalvadi chiefs at the end of the sixteenth century. The town was held alternately by the Muhammadans and the Marathas till taken in 1671 by the Mysore Raja, and it then formed the north frontier town. Dodda Deva Raja of Mysore died here in 1672. The place was plundered and the fort destroyed by the Marathas on their way to join Lord Cornwallis before Seringapatam in 1791. It is a prosperous town, surrounded by coco-nut and areca-nut gardens. Their produce, with the white and coloured cotton cloths made in the place, are largely sold at the weekly fair. There are seven endowed temples. The municipality dates from 1870. The receipts and expenditure during the ten years ending 1901 averaged Rs. 2,700 and Rs. 2,500. In 1903-4 they were Rs. 4,000 and Rs. 3,800.\n\nChikodi Taluka.\u2014North-western taluka of Belgaum District, Bombay, lying between 16\u00b0 3' and 16\u00b0 40' N. and 74\u00b0 15' and 74\u00b0 48' E., with an area, including the Hukeri petty subdivision (petha), of 836 square miles. It contains two towns, Nifani (population, 11,632) and Yamkanmardi (4,556); and 210 villages, including Bhoj (5,450), Borgaon (5,495), Chikodi, the head-quarters (8,037), Eksambie (5,970), Hukeri (6,265), Karadge (5,138), Kongnoli (5,597), Sadalgi (9,091), and Sankeshwar (5,639). The population in 1901 was 304,549, compared with 295,395 in 1891. Chikodi is the most thickly populated taluka in the District, with a density of 364 persons per square mile, and this was the only taluka which increased in population between 1891 and 1901. The demand for land revenue in 1903-4 was 3.34 lakhs, and for cesses Rs. 32,000. The rich black soil of the north gradually passes into red towards the west. In the south the soil is gritty and poor. The taluka is famous for its tobacco, sugar-cane, fruit, and vegetable gardens. The irrigation wells protect a large area. The annual rainfall averages 32 inches.\n\nChikodi Village.\u2014Head-quarters of the taluka of the same name in Belgaum District, Bombay, situated in 16\u00b0 26' N. and 74\u00b0 35' E., 16 miles from Chikodi station on the Southern Mahratta Railway. Population (1901), 8,037. It is a considerable entrepot of trade\nbetween the interior and the coast, with which it has ready communication by a road from Nip\u0101ni over the Phonda gh\u0101t. Cotton goods are manufactured, chiefly for local use. It was described as a large and respectable town by Captain Moor in 1790. The neighbourhood was then famous for grapes of extraordinary size and flavour. Chikodi contains a Subordinate Judge's court, a dispensary, and four schools with 200 pupils, of which one is a girls' school with 40 pupils.\n\nChikti\u0101bar.\u2014Thakur\u0101t in Bhop\u0101war Agency, Central India.\n\nChilambaran.\u2014Subdivision, t\u0101luk, and town in South Arcot District, Madras.

It is famous as the scene of Lord Gough's doubtful victory over Sher Singh in the second Sikh War in 1849. Lord Gough, after marching for several days from the Chen\u0101b, came in sight of the enemy near Chili\u0101nw\u0101la on the afternoon of January 13. While his men were engaged in taking ground for an encampment, a few shots from the Sikh horse artillery fell within his lines. The general thereupon gave the order for an immediate attack; and the British moved rapidly forward through the thick jungle, in the face of masked batteries. Beaten back time after time, they still advanced upon the unseen enemy, until at last, by some misapprehension, a regiment of cavalry began to retreat in a somewhat disorderly manner. Although by this time the troops had taken fifteen or sixteen of the enemy's guns, and the artillery had swept the Sikh line from end to end, the unfortunate panic among the cavalry, the loss of almost an entire British regiment (the 24th), and the approach of darkness combined to prevent continued action. The Sikhs remained in possession of more than one British gun, besides holding some colours. At the end of the engagement, the British troops maintained their position, and the enemy retreated during the night. The British lost 22 European officers, 16 native officers, and 561 men killed, and 98 missing; while 67 European officers, 27 native officers, and 1,547 men were wounded. The temporary loss of prestige was fully retrieved by the decisive battle of Gujrat, a month later, which placed the whole Punjab in the power of Lord Gough. An obelisk, erected upon the spot, commemorates the British officers and men who lost their lives upon the field, which is known to the people of the neighbourhood as Katalghar, or the 'house of slaughter.'\n\nChilka Lake.\u2014A shallow inland gulf, situated between $19^\\circ 28'$ and $19^\\circ 56'$ N. and $85^\\circ 6'$ and $85^\\circ 86'$ E., in the south-east corner of Puri District, Bengal, and in the extreme south extending into the Madras District of Ganjam. A long sandy ridge, in places little more than\n200 yards wide, separates it from the Bay of Bengal, with which its only connexion is by a single narrow mouth intersecting this ridge towards its centre. On the west and south the lake is walled in by lofty hills, while to the north it loses itself in endless shallows, sedgy banks, and islands just peeping above the surface, formed year by year from the silt which the rivers bring down. The lake spreads out into a pear-shaped expanse of water 44 miles long, of which the northern half has a mean breadth of about 20 miles, while the south tapers into an irregularly curved point, barely averaging 5 miles wide. Its smallest area is 344 square miles in the dry season, increasing to about 450 during the rainy season; and the average depth is from 3 to 5 feet, scarcely anywhere exceeding 6 feet. The bed is a very few feet below the high-water level of the sea, although in some parts it is slightly below low-water mark. The narrow tidal stream, which rushes through the neck connecting the lake with the sea, suffices to keep the water distinctly salt during the dry months from December to June. But once the rains have set in, and the Bh\u0101rgavi and Day\u0101 rivers come pouring down upon its northern extremity, the sea-water is gradually driven out and the Chilka becomes a fresh-water lake. This changeable mass of water forms one of a series of lacustrine formations along the western shores of the Bay of Bengal, the result of a perpetual war going on between the rivers and the sea\u2014the former struggling to find vent for their water and silt, the latter repelling them with its sand-laden currents.\n\nThe Chilka may be regarded as a gulf of the original Bay of Bengal. On the south, a bold, barren spur of hills runs down to the coast; on the north the land-making rivers have pushed out their rounded mouths and flat deltas into the ocean. Nor has the sea been idle. Meeting and overmastering the languid river-discharge that enters the Chilka, it has joined the two extremities with a bar of sand, and thus formed a lake. The delicate process of land-making from the river silt at the north-east end of the lake is slowly but steadily going on, while the bar-building sea is still busily at work. Old documents show that a century ago the neck of land dividing the lake from the sea was only from half a mile to a mile broad in places where it is now two miles; and the opening in the bar, which was a mile wide in 1780 and had to be crossed in large boats, was described forty years later as choked up. Shortly before 1825 an artificial mouth had to be cut; and although this also rapidly began to silt up, it remained, as late as 1837, more than three times its present breadth. The difficulty in maintaining an outlet from the Chilka forms one of the chief obstacles to utilizing the lake as an escape for the floods that desolate the delta. Engineers report that, although it would be easy and cheap to cut a channel, it would be very costly and difficult to keep it open; and that each successive mouth would speedily choke up and share the fate of its predecessors.\nThe scenery of the Chilka is very varied, and in parts exceedingly picturesque. In the south and west hill ranges bound its shores; and in this part it is dotted with a number of small rocky islands. Proceeding northwards, the lake expands into a majestic sheet of water. Half-way across is Nalbana, literally 'the reed forest,' an island about 5 miles in circumference, scarcely anywhere rising more than a few inches above water-level. This island is altogether uninhabited, but is regularly visited by parties of thatchers from the mainland, who cut the reeds and high grasses with which it is covered. On the eastern side of the lake lie the islands of P\u0101rik\u016bd, with new silt formations behind and now partially joined to the narrow ridge of land which separates the Chilka from the sea. At some places they emerge almost imperceptibly from the water; at others, they spread out into well-raised rice-fields. Their northern extremity slopes gracefully down to the lake like an English park, dotted with fine trees, and backed by noble masses of foliage. Water-fowl of all kinds are very abundant in every part of the lake. Beyond the northern end of P\u0101rik\u016bd, the lake gradually shallows until it becomes solid ground, for here the Pur\u012b rivers empty themselves and the process of land-making is going on. The northern shores of the Chilka comprise the parganas of Sirai and Chaubisk\u016bd, and it is these tracts which have to bear the greatest suffering in times of general inundation in Pur\u012b.\n\nAt its southern extremity in the Madras District of Ganj\u0101m stands the village of Rambha. Before Ganj\u0101m town was overwhelmed with fever and when it was still the capital of the District which bears its name, this used to be a favourite resort of its European residents in the hot months.\n\nA tidal canal 7 miles long connects the lake with the Rushikulya river and is navigable throughout the year. Large quantities of grain are imported from Orissa across the lake and along this canal, and salt is exported in return. The boats employed are flat-bottomed vessels, which are poled against the wind or drift before it under crazy mat sails.\n\nChin\u0101b.\u2014River in the Punjab and Kashmir.

See M\u0101heji.\n\nChinchli.\u2014Village in the State of Kolhapur, Bombay, situated in 16\u00b0 34' N. and 74\u00b0 50' E., on the Kistna, about 42 miles south-east of Kolhapur city. Population (1901), 3,540. Chinchli is a station on the Southern Maharatta Railway. The place is chiefly known for the shrine of the goddess Mah\u0101k\u0101l\u012b, popularly called M\u0101y\u0101ka. Four times a year pilgrims visit the shrine; and on the full moon of M\u0101gh (January\u2013February) a large fair is held, which is attended by about 35,000 people.\nChinchli-Gadad.\u2014Petty State in the Dangs, Bombay.\n\nChincholi.\u2014North-eastern taluk of Gulbarga District, Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State, with an area of 413 square miles. The population in 1901 was 58,860, compared with 50,737 in 1891. Chincholi (population, 4,008) is the head-quarters, and the taluk contains 110 villages, of which 41 are j\u0101gr\u012b. The land revenue in 1901 was 1.5 lakhs. Chincholi is hilly, and composed of lateritic and black cotton soils. In the rearrangement of 1905 the taluk received a few villages from Kodangal.\n\nChinchvad.\u2014Village in the Haveli taluka of Poona District, Bombay, situated in 18\u00b0 37' N. and 73\u00b0 47' E., about 10 miles north-west of Poona city, on the right bank of the Pauna, which falls into the Mula below the village of Aundh, and on the Great Indian Peninsula Railway. Population (1901), 1,596. Chinchvad is famous as the residence of a shrine of the god Ganpati, who is said to have become incarnate in the person of a boy, namely Moroba, about the middle of the seventeenth century. The boy performed many miracles, and when he died was succeeded by a number of incarnations in the same family, known as the Devs of Chinchvad. Of these, Moroba's son Chint\u0101man was the second living god. He once assumed the form of Ganpati to satisfy the jealousy of the great V\u0101ni poet Tuk\u0101r\u0101m, who prided himself on Vithoba's coming to dine with him. Tuk\u0101r\u0101m called Chint\u0101man by the surname of God or Dev, and this surname has passed to his descendants. Chint\u0101man died a natural death and was succeeded by N\u0101r\u0101yan, the third Dev, who is reported to have changed into a bunch of jessamine flowers a dish of beef which Aurangzeb sent him to test his godhood. Aurangzeb was so pleased with the miracle that he is said to have made an hereditary grant of eight villages to the Dev family. The last Dev drew upon himself a curse by opening the grave of Moroba, who, disturbed in his meditations, told him that the godhood would end with his son. The son died childless in 1810, and with him ended the seventh generation of the Dev family. A boy named Sakhari, a distant relation of the deceased, was set up in his place by the priesthood to preserve the valuable grants to the temple.\n\nThe Dev family live in a mansion on the river built partly by N\u0101na Farnavis and partly by Hari Pant Phadke, a Mar\u0101th\u0101 general of the end of the eighteenth century. Near the palace stand two temples each sacred to one of the departed Devs. The chief temple is dedicated to Moroba. It is a low, plain building with a square hall or mandap and an octagonal shrine. On the wall of the inner shrine is an inscription recording the building of the temple in 1659. On the outer wall of the temple of Sri N\u0101r\u0101yan, the third Dev, is another inscription according to which it was finished in 1720. A yearly fair attended by about 2,000 persons is held here in honour of Ganpati on the sixth day\nof the dark half of the month of Margshirsh (December\u2013January), and lasts for a week. Chinchvad contains a school with 132 boys and 13 girls.\n\nChindwin District, Lower.\u2014District in the Sagaing Division of Upper Burma, lying between $21^\\circ 48'$ and $22^\\circ 50'$ N. and $94^\\circ 16'$ and $95^\\circ 39'$ E., with an area of 3,480 square miles. In shape it is roughly a triangle, with its apex towards the north, and it is bounded on the north by the Upper Chindwin and Shwebo Districts; on the west by Pakokku District, from which it is separated by the Pondaung range; on the east by Shwebo District; and on the south by Pakokku and Sagaing. Its main natural feature is the Chindwin River, which flows across the District from north-west to south-east, dividing it into two equal parts east and west, and bisecting its southern base. During the rains this river has a strong current and varies much in breadth; in places it is fully a mile across from bank to bank, while about 20 miles north of Monywa the channel is narrowed to about 60 feet by the Shwezaye defile, a serious obstacle to navigation during the highest floods. Elsewhere the stream is easily navigable throughout the year by the largest river-craft. In the west the double range of the Pondaung runs north and south. The northern half of the western boundary of the District follows the western, and the southern half the eastern ridge of the Pondaung, the border line crossing from one to the other at the watershed separating the Taungdwin stream in its narrow deserted upper valley from the sources of the Kyaw, which, flowing south, waters part of Pakokku District. Along the whole length of this western boundary the Pondaung maintains an average height of 4,000 feet. East of the Pondaung and between it and the Chindwin is the Mahudaung range, which enters the District from the Upper Chindwin, and runs generally southwards to about 15 miles from the southern boundary, its highest point being 2,305 feet above the sea. In the valley between this range and the Pondaung run northwards the Patolon, and southwards the North Yoma stream. The former traverses a sparsely populated valley, passes into the Upper Chindwin District, and eventually joins the Chindwin river just below Mingin. The latter, flowing south, bends round the southern end of the Mahudaung range and finally unites with the Kyaukmyet, a large affluent of the Chindwin which empties itself into the main stream almost opposite Monywa. Between the Mahudaung and the Chindwin river is a small hill range, about 25 miles in length, called the Thingadon, which is separated from the Mahudaung by the waters of the Thingadon chaung. The triangle formed by the Mahudaung range, the Chindwin river, and the southern boundary of the District is, in its northern part, rugged and hilly, the villages being confined mostly to the banks of the Chindwin and its small affluents.\nThe southern portion is much flatter and more evenly populated, being broken only in the south-east by sporadic hill masses, of which the most notable are the Powundaung, the Taungkomaik, and the Letpadauing in the Salingyi township, each about 1,000 feet in height, and the Pagyidaung in the Pale township. The first named is remarkable on account of the cave temples it contains. This southern plain is watered by the Kyaukmyet chaung referred to above, and by the Nga Kon Yama stream, which forms the greater part of the southern boundary of the District. The country east of the Chindwin is undulating, and is bisected by the low Nwegwedaung range, which sends out small streams westwards to the Chindwin and eastwards to the Mu. This latter river bounds the District for about 20 miles near its south-eastern corner, and is navigable by country boats throughout the year. The only tributaries of the Chindwin of any considerable size on the eastern side are the Inbaung and Weka chaungs in the extreme north of the District, which rise in Shwebo and unite 3 miles before joining the main stream.\n\nLittle is known of the detailed geology of the District. The rocks are entirely of Tertiary age. In the extreme west Nummulitic lime, stone and shales are exposed. These are followed to the east by miocene clays and sandstones, and these again by the soft sandstones which cover the greater part of the District and belong to the pliocene period. An interesting feature is the occurrence of several explosion craters\u2014rounded or oval hollows, sometimes containing lakes. They may extend, as at Leshe, to a width of over a mile, with depressions of 100 to 200 feet bordered by precipitous margins. The low ridges of fragmentary rocks, and the scattered blocks lying about the plain, are probably the result of ejection by volcanic action.\n\nThe chief plants found are the okshit (Aegle Marmelos), thanatka (Murraya exotica), lamaka (Melia Azadirachta), tawtamaka (Melia birmanica), and tanaung (Acacia leucophloea); and among the flowers may be mentioned shwenwe-pan (Cassytha filiformis) and migvaungwepan (Derris scandens). Further details regarding the vegetation will be found under the heads of Agriculture and Forests.\n\nThe characteristic wild animals are elephants, leopards, thamin (brow-antlered deer), tsine or hsaing (Bos sondaicus), daye (hog deer), and wild hog. Elephants are found in the eastern jungles, the other wild animals all over the District. Tigers are rare. In the cold season water-fowl swarm in abundance on the sandbanks in the Chindwin and in the jhils in its neighbourhood.\n\nThe District is situated in the dry zone, and the heat during the months of March, April, and May is considerable; the climate during the monsoon, on the other hand, is breezy and moderate, and the winter is delightful. The maximum temperature at Monywa averages 81\u00b0 in\nDecember and 97\u00b0 in May, and the minimum 59\u00b0 in December and 81\u00b0 in May, while temperatures as low as 52\u00b0 and as high as 106\u00b0 have been occasionally registered. The average mean for the year is 83\u00b0. Rainfall is registered at Monywa, Pale, Budalin, and Kant. The total fall for the year 1900\u20131 recorded at these stations was 32, 45, 43, and 52 inches respectively. As elsewhere in the northern portion of the dry zone, the rainfall increases towards the north.\n\nThe Chindwin country was entered by British troops in 1886, and during the early part of 1887 a battalion of military police arrived in the District, and civil police were enlisted with a view to its pacification. At first, the present Upper and Lower Chindwin Districts formed a single Deputy-Commissioner's charge, with head-quarters at Alon; but in 1888 the District was split up into two, and Monywa was eventually made the head-quarters of the southern portion. In April, 1887, the rebel Hla U, who had been practically ruling the Ayadaw and Kudaw townships on the Shwebo and Sagaing borders, and committing numerous dacoities during the year, was killed by one of his own lieutenants at Wadawma. On the other side of the river trouble was greatest around Pagyi (now the Salingyi township), where three risings took place, two in 1887 and one in 1888. In the first outbreak two attacks were made on a dacoit leader Po Tok, who had killed the Kani wun; in the first engagement a British officer and some sepoys were wounded; in the second Po Tok was presumably killed near Kyadet, as he was never heard of again. The second disturbance was late in 1887, and was headed by a man who styled himself the Shwegyobyu prince, assisted by two dacoit leaders named Nga Saga and Nga Pyo, who afterwards gave much trouble. The rebels were attacked at Chinbyit by a British force consisting of a few mounted men with three officers, two of whom, Major Kennedy and Captain Beville, were killed. A force of 70 rifles came up later, but the three leaders managed to escape, leaving 40 dead. Several other dacoits of mark were captured in the operations under the late General Penn Symons, and the establishment of civil police guards at Salingyi and elsewhere helped to keep the District quiet for a time. An attempted rising in 1888 was quashed by the arrest at Monywa, and the subsequent execution, of a suspect known as the Nagabo prince, who was arranging a rebellion with the Shwegyobyu prince, Nga Saga, and Nga Pyo. The three Bos, however, really did rise in the Yaw country in 1889, and the rebellion acquired serious dimensions; but the rebels were dispersed at Gangaw by a force of 200 men, the Shwegyobyu prince fled to the Chin Hills, Nga Saga was killed, and Nga Pyo slain by a fellow leader. With the suppression of this rising the peace of the District was assured.\n\nMany celebrated pagodas are situated in the District. One of con-\nsiderable note is the Alaungdaw Kathapa, built on the watershed between the Patolon and Yoma streams in the Kani township, in memory of the Buddhist monk who is said to have conducted the first Synod held after the Buddha's death. A large number of pilgrims from different parts of Burma visit it every year. Other notable shrines are the Paungwa, the Shwekuni, the Shwegu, the Sutaungbyi, the Shwemyindin, the Shwezigon, the Shinbyuyatkyi, and the Ingyindaung pagodas. Powundaung, a hill about 3 miles east of Lengauk village in the Salingyi township, is noted for its numerous cave temples carved out of sandstone rock. There are said to be 444,444 images of Buddha of different sizes in these recesses.\n\nThe population increased from 233,316 in 1891 to 276,383 in 1901. Its distribution in the latter year is shown in the following table:\n\n| Township | Area in square miles | Number of Towns | Villages | Population | Population per square mile | Percentage of population increase between 1891 and 1901 | Number of persons able to read and write |\n|----------|---------------------|----------------|---------|------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Bodalin  | 451                 | 196            | 55,447  | 123        | + 9                       | 9,837                                                  |\n| Monywa   | 487                 | 297            | 90,164  | 185        | + 25                      | 17,118                                                 |\n| Kani     | 1,788               | 256            | 48,717  | 27         | + 18                      | 8,712                                                  |\n| Salingyi | 296                 | 211            | 50,814  | 172        | + 16                      | 10,707                                                 |\n| Pale     | 458                 | 152            | 31,241  | 68         | + 22                      | 5,978                                                  |\n| District total | 3,480             | 1,212          | 276,383 | 79         | + 18                      | 52,352                                                 |\n\nThe only town is Monywa, the head-quarters of the District. The density of population is identical with the average for the whole of the dry zone of Upper Burma. Within the District the density varies considerably from tract to tract; the Salingyi township, on the west bank of the Chindwin river in the south of the District, is one of the most thickly populated townships of Upper Burma, while in the Kani township in the north-west the inhabitants are as scattered as in some of the wildest areas of the Province. The Census of 1901 showed that the Lower Chindwin had a higher proportion of females than any other District of Burma. This large excess was probably due to a temporary exodus of males to the harvest fields of more fertile Districts. There has been very little immigration into the Lower Chindwin from the rest of Burma. Buddhists form 99 per cent. of the population, and outside Monywa hardly anything is spoken but Burmese.\n\nThe Indian residents of the District are all immigrants, mainly from the Punjab, Bengal, the United Provinces, and Madras, and include 800 Musalmans and 900 Hindus. The great majority of the population consist of Burmans, who in 1901 numbered 274,200, or more than 99 per cent. of the total. Of indigenous non-Burmans there are none,\nand on the whole the Lower Chindwin may be looked upon as one of the most typically Burman Districts in the Province. The number of persons wholly dependent on agriculture in 1901 was 165,624, or about 60 per cent. of the total population.\n\nThere is only one mission (a Wesleyan one), and the total number of Christians in 1901 was only 188, of whom 111 were natives.\n\nThe principal soils are sand, clay, and silt. Sandy earth of poor crop-bearing capacity predominates; clay is found over many of the levels, and belts of alluvial soil stretch along the banks of the larger watercourses. Throughout the District primitive agricultural methods are still followed. The land is as a rule prepared with the ordinary *ton* or harrow, while for the alluvial *kyun* or *kaing* cultivation the *te* or plough is used.\n\nThe area cultivated in 1891 was 280 square miles, which rose to 542 square miles in 1901. The main agricultural statistics for 1903-4 are shown, in square miles, in the following table:\n\n| Township | Total area | Cultivated | Irrigated | Forests |\n|----------|------------|------------|-----------|---------|\n| Budalin  | 451        | 182        |           |         |\n| Monywa   | 487        | 191        |           |         |\n| Kani     | 1,788      | 32         | 1.25      | 2,072   |\n| Salingyi | 296        | 147        | 2.63      |         |\n| Pale     | 458        | 55         | 0.64      |         |\n| **Total**| **3,480**  | **607**    | **4.52**  | **2,072**|\n\nThe cultivated area is for the most part situated in the townships on the east bank of the Chindwin, and in the Salingyi township adjoining the western bank of that stream. Of the total cultivated area, rice occupied 99 square miles in 1903-4. Nearly half the entire rice crop, and almost the whole of the hot-season rice (12 square miles), is grown in the Salingyi township, where facilities for irrigation are greater than elsewhere. The chief crop is, however, not rice but *jowar*, which covered 281 square miles; and even the area under sesamum (125 square miles) was larger in 1903-4 than that devoted to rice. Gram is grown on 7,800 acres, mostly in the Monywa township, and beans and the like on 34,200 acres. A considerable area (12,400 acres) is under cotton, which does well in the *ya* or upland of the Monywa, Budalin, and Salingyi townships. Tobacco is cultivated mainly in Pale and Monywa, covering an area of 1,400 acres. The garden-cultivation is exceptionally small (only 1,900 acres), and consists mainly of plantain groves. The average area of a holding is 4 acres.\n\nNo advances under the Land Improvement Loans Act have been made, but loans under the Agriculturists' Loans Act are granted every\nyear, according to the requirements of the season, and are freely sought after. In 1903-4 a sum of Rs. 21,700 was so advanced to cultivators. Very little has been done in the way of introducing new staples.\n\nCows, sheep, goats, and ponies are bred all over the Lower Chindwin, not, however, as a rule, for gain, but to meet local requirements. No special grazing-grounds are allotted. The cattle are allowed to rove at will through the jungles, where pasturage is sufficient during the greater part of the year; but difficulties in regard to fodder spring up in the dry season, when the cultivators are obliged to fall back on the *pyaung* (*jowar*) stalk kept in reserve for their live-stock. In seasons of prolonged drought cattle suffer a great deal from want of water.\n\nThere are no 'major' or 'minor' Government irrigation works of any kind, but a small area is watered from tanks and canals dug by private individuals in the Yinnabin subdivision. The area thus supplied in 1903-4 was 3,000 acres. No important fisheries exist, but fishing is carried on in the bed of the Chindwin and in the *jhils* adjoining its banks. The fishery revenue in 1903-4 amounted to Rs. 8,100.\n\nThe limits of the District are conterminous with those of the Lower Chindwin Forest division. Most of the forests lie in the hills to the west, and may be roughly divided into the following classes: teak-bearing forests, *indaing* forests with teak, *indaing* forests with no teak, forests with pines. In the first class *pyingado* (*Xylia dolabriformis*) is the commonest tree. In the second, *padauk* is also plentiful, intermixed largely with jungle woods of every variety. In the third, *in* (*Dipterocarpus tuberculatus*), *thitya* (*Shorea obtusa*), and *ingvin* (*Pentacme siamensis*) predominate, while *dahat* (*Tectona Hamiltoniana*) is also found. The fourth class consists of isolated patches of pines occurring in places along the summit of the Pondaung. No special plantations of trees of economic value have been formed. Among minor products, cutch, bamboos, and canes yield the largest revenue; but small sums are also realized on *indwe*, *pyenjet*, and *shaw* (*Sterculia sp.*) fibre. In 1903 the District contained 647 square miles of 'reserved' forests, the most important being the three Patolon Reserves (318 square miles), situated in the basin of the Patolon *chaung* in the north of the District. The gross forest revenue in 1903-4 was Rs. 40,600.\n\nSulphate of copper has been found in the Letpadaung hills in the Salingyi township, and a licence to prospect for it has been granted recently. Gold occurs at Chinbyit in the Pale township; garnets and tourmaline exist near Salingyi, and petroleum at Kine, in the Pale township, and at the foot of the Mahudaung range in the Kani township. Besides these minerals, clay, laterte, and gravel are found all over the District, and limestone in small quantities in the hills. In 1900 prospecting licences for petroleum\nwere granted to several individuals, two of whom started boring for oil, but met with no success and abandoned their enterprise. There have been numerous applications of late for prospecting licences for earth-oil in Kani, but most of them have not been favourably entertained. The Burma Oil Company has, however, obtained a licence to prospect over an area of 20 square miles in that township, and has already started operations. Salt is manufactured in Salingyi by boiling the water from brine-wells.\n\nA little wood-carving is done at Alon, and there are potteries at Ayadaw and Vedwet near the Shwebo border, where pots for drinking and cooking purposes are manufactured. Brass gongs, spoons, cups, &c., are turned out at Indaing.\n\nTrade and communications. The Lower Chindwin gongs have achieved considerable local notoriety, and, a few years ago, the annual value of the trade in these articles was estimated at about Rs. 23,000. Burmese saddles and bridles are manufactured at Kyehmon and Monywe, near the Sagaing border; das are forged at Baunggya on the Mu; silk-weaving is carried on at Kothan, though on a small scale; and slippers are made at Kanbya. A great deal of lacquer-ware in the form of trays, bowls, and other utensils is produced at Kyaukka in the Monywa and Maungdaung in the Budalin township. The Kyaukka lacquer-ware finds a ready market in Lower Burma. Mats and pas (baskets with covers) are woven in the Yinnabin subdivision. With the exception of the gongs and the lacquer-ware, the articles named are produced mostly for local use. A saw-mill was started about half a mile from Monywa town on the left bank of the Chindwin in 1900, but has not proved a financial success and is not worked regularly. A rice-mill, which was opened in 1901, has similarly failed to attract local custom.\n\nThe Lower Chindwin is an almost wholly agricultural District, and its chief exports are pulse, jaggery (unrefined sugar), and jowar, of which the first two are sent in large quantities to Lower Burma. Besides these agricultural commodities cutch is exported, as well as brass and lacquer-work. The principal imports are ngapi, salt, salted fish, and goods of foreign manufacture. Paddy comes in from the Upper Chindwin and Shwebo Districts, and rice from Lower Burma. The exports and imports are for the most part conveyed by means of country boats and the Irrawaddy Flotilla Company's steamers, and by rail, the only important exception being the paddy from Upper Chindwin, which comes on rafts down the Chindwin to Monywa, where it is distributed to the villages inland. Paddy from Shwebo District is brought in by the cart-road connecting Ye-u with Monywa. Most of the ngapi and salted fish comes from the delta Districts of Lower Burma in country boats, while salt is imported from Rangoon by both rail and steamer. The main trading centres are Monywa, and Saton, Kyauk-\nmyet, and Ywashe in the Yinmabin subdivision on the western bank of the Chindwin. Most of the people engaged in trade are Burmans and Chinamen. Natives of India do business on a small scale at many of the bazar towns and villages.\n\nThe Sagaing-Alon railway runs along the western border of the Monywa township, with its terminus at Alon, 7 miles north of Monywa, and has four stations in the District. Eight roads, with a total length of 146 miles, are kept up by the Public Works department: namely, Monywa towards Ye-u, in Shwebo District, 32 miles; Monywa towards Myimu, in Sagaing District, 11 miles; Monywa to Magyizauk, 36 miles (26 unmetalled); Saton to Kyadet, 17 miles; Tandaw, opposite Monywa, to Yinmabin, 15 miles; and three shorter roads. The District fund maintains about 350 miles of unmetalled tracks connecting the towns and more important villages.\n\nWeekly services of Government and Irrawaddy Flotilla Company's steamers on the Chindwin touch at Saton, Monywa, Alon, and Kani. Communications are further maintained by eleven ferries on the Chindwin river and three on the Mu.\n\nThe rainfall is fickle and untrustworthy, and few years pass without some slight threatenings of local drought. Towards the end of 1891 failure of rain brought about a serious scarcity of food-grains in the then existing Monywa, Ayadaw, and Kudaw townships, as well as in a portion of the Kani township; and it was found necessary to open famine relief works, which involved an expenditure of about Rs. 90,000. The distress was in places severe, extending over an area of 75 square miles, and affecting a population of 30,000, while relief operations lasted for 45 weeks. The highest daily attendance on the works was 4,332 persons, and the total number of units relieved from the beginning to the end of the period of scarcity was 362,866. The failure of crops is said to have driven between 2,000 and 3,000 families out of the District. The efforts of the local officials were, however, so successful that, judging from the census returns, the District had recovered from its effects by 1901. There has been no serious harvest failure since 1891.\n\nThe District is divided for administrative purposes into two subdivisions: Monywa, to the east of the Chindwin, comprising the Budalin and Monywa townships; and Yinmabin, for the most part to the west of the river, comprising Administration. the Kani, Salingyi, and Pale townships. These are in charge of the usual executive officers, under whom are 804 village headmen, 511 of whom receive no commission on their revenue collections. Kani was, under Burmese rule, the head-quarters of a wun, and the present township officer still retains the courtesy title of wun of Kani. The District, with the Chin Hills and the Upper Chindwin District,\nforms the Chindwin Public Works division, with head-quarters at Monywa.\n\nThe subdivisional and township officers are civil judges in their respective charges, the Monywa township officer being assisted in his civil work by the treasury officer, who is also head-quarters magistrate. The people resort readily to the civil courts, and as the area of private land is comparatively extensive, the number of suits for the possession of property is large. The criminal courts are presided over by the executive officers, and crime is of the usual type.\n\nAs in other parts of Upper Burma, the main source of revenue under native rule was *thathameda*, levied at the rate of Rs. 10 a household. It was assessed by specially selected village elders (*thamadis*), and shortly before annexation brought in about 2\u00bd lakhs annually. The land revenue proper was then insignificant in amount. It was derived only from state lands, and represented a fraction of the produce valued at current market rates. The other sources of revenue, such as customs, brokerage, and the like, were mostly given up on annexation, excise being levied in their place. On the introduction of British rule the land revenue proper and *thathameda* were collected as before, the former being levied at the rate of one-third of the annual produce of certain lands belonging to royal servants and their descendants and a few others. The direct assessment of land revenue was introduced in 1902-3. A summary settlement was made, and acreage rates were sanctioned in the Monywa and Budalin townships, with the result that the land revenue, which in 1900-1 had been only Rs. 8,200, rose in 1903-4 to more than a lakh and a half, this increase being counter-balanced, however, by a corresponding reduction in the *thathameda*, which fell from 5\u00b77 lakhs to 4\u00b76 lakhs. The whole of the Salingyi township and parts of the Pale and Kani townships were placed under supplementary survey in 1904, and acreage rates have now been sanctioned. According to the present settlement, the rates on non-state land vary from Rs. 1-4 to Rs. 1-8 on rice lands, from 6 to 8 annas on *ya* or upland crops, and from 12 annas to Rs. 3-4 on *kaing* or alluvial crops. On state land the range is from 6 annas on *ya* land to Rs. 4-8 on *kaing* cultivation. The greater part of the District falls under the category of *kaing* or *ya*. Regular settlement operations are now in progress.\n\nThe following table shows the growth of the revenue since 1890-1, in thousands of rupees:\n\n|                | 1890-1 | 1900-1 | 1903-4 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Land revenue   | 5      | 8      | 1,59   |\n| Total revenue  | ...    | 6,46   | 6,70   |\nThathamada is still the main source of revenue.\n\nThe income of the District fund for the provision of roads, d\u0101k-bungalows, &c., amounted in 1903-4 to Rs. 13,000, the main item of expenditure being Rs. 10,300 on public works. The District and the Monywa municipal fund are the only two Local funds.\n\nUnder the District Superintendent of police are two subdivisional police officers, stationed at Monywa and Yinmabin. The strength of the civil police force is 2 inspectors (in charge of the subdivisions), 9 head constables, 30 sergeants, and 326 constables. There are 9 police stations and 12 outposts. Monywa is the head-quarters of the Chindwin military police battalion, 1,130 strong. Of these, 585 are stationed at Monywa and 30 at Yinmabin; the rest are distributed in the Upper Chindwin District. The commandant and two assistant commandants are at the battalion head-quarters, and a third assistant commandant at Kindat. The District jail at Monywa has accommodation for 118 persons. Wheat is ground by its inmates for the military police, and a little carpentry is done for Government departments and for sale to the public. The produce of the jail garden is used for the prisoners' food; what is not required for this purpose is sold.\n\nThe proportion of literate persons in 1901 was 41 per cent. in the case of males, and 2 per cent. in that of females, or 19 per cent. for both sexes together. In view of the fact that the District contains no backward hill tribes and comparatively few natives of India, the figure is somewhat low for Burma. The attitude of the local ecclesiastics towards education may have something to do with this. There are indications that the pagodas view the Government methods of teaching with special disfavour, and that the local educational staff have had more than ordinary difficulty in combating this feeling. It appears further that the people, who are largely agriculturists, evince no desire to have their children educated to a high standard, though they are willing enough to send their sons to the Government survey school. There is only one Anglo-veracular aided school, the English Wesleyan Mission School. The number of aided vernacular schools in 1903-4 was 139. The District contains 3 secondary, 137 primary, and 769 elementary (private) schools. The number of pupils was 5,162 in 1890-1, 8,344 in 1900-1, and 9,961 (including 763 girls) in 1903-4. The expenditure on education in the last year was Rs. 8,900, towards which Provincial funds contributed Rs. 7,100, and fees Rs. 1,800.\n\nIn addition to a military police hospital with 40 beds, there is a civil hospital at Monywa with 32 beds. In 1903 the number of cases treated was 9,406, including 435 in-patients, and 151 operations were performed. The income of the civil hospital was Rs. 5,400, made up of Rs. 2,500 from Provincial funds, Rs. 2,400 from municipal funds, and Rs. 500\nfrom subscriptions. A small dispensary has recently been opened at Vinnabin.\n\nVaccination is compulsory within the limits of the Monywa municipality. In 1903-4 the number of persons successfully vaccinated was 9,387, representing 34 per 1,000 of the population.\n\nChindwin District, Upper.\u2014District in the Sagaing Division of Upper Burma, lying between $22^\\circ 36'$ and $26^\\circ 22'$ N. and $93^\\circ 58'$ and $96^\\circ 20'$ E., with an area of 18,590 square miles. It takes its name from the Chindwin river, which flows through it from north to south, and is the largest District in Burma. Geographically, the District contains two Shan States administered by their Sawbwas, Zingkaling Hkamti and Hsaunghsup, over which the Deputy-Commissioner exercises a certain amount of control. It is bounded on the north by the Tar\u00f3 and Hukawng valleys, which encircle the head-waters of the Chindwin; on the south by the Pakokku and Lower Chindwin Districts; on the east by Myitkyina, Kath\u00e1, and Shwebo; and on the west by Assam, Manipur, and the Chin Hills. In shape it is an irregular parallelogram, roughly 250 miles long and 50 broad. Its mountain ranges are grouped into two main systems, west and east of the Chindwin river. In the extreme north-west of the District, on the borders of the Zingkaling Hkamti State, are the outlying mountains of the great pile of upland which separates Burma from Assam. In this group is the highest peak in Burma, Saramei or Nwemauktaung (12,557 feet), often capped with snow. From the main mass branches a series of more or less parallel ridges about 2,000 to 3,000 feet in height, which run in a southerly direction right down into Pakokku District. In the north these ranges are generally known collectively as the Yoma, farther south they are called the Pon-daung. For a considerable distance within the District they are skirted on their eastern flank by the Chindwin river, which they separate from the Kale and Kabaw valleys. The latter, sloping gently away from each other north and south, form one long, very fertile depression, 150 miles in length and about 8 miles in breadth, locked between the Yoma and the loftier ranges of Manipur and the Chin Hills. The hill system west of the Irrawaddy starts in the extreme north of Burma from the highlands separating the basins of the Irrawaddy and the Chindwin, and runs in a south-south-west direction, dividing the Upper Chindwin from Kath\u00e1 and Shweb\u00f3 Districts. It consists of a range of abrupt hills, averaging about 1,000 feet in height, but rising to over 5,000 feet in the north of the District in an eminence known as the Taunghnon, or 'three mountains.' Its spurs extend towards the Chindwin over the wide intervening valley, cutting it up into well-watered tracts, which give the District, and especially the southern portion, its richness in hill and river scenery. The Chindwin River runs southwards throughout the\nlength of the District, entering it at the kyaukse ('stone weir'), a barrier of rocks in the extreme north that prevents access by boat to the Hukawng valley. During its course through the District it is joined by several streams, of which the most important are the Yu and the Myittha on the west and the Uyu on the east. The Yu river, which is composed of several affluents rising in the Manipur plateau, and draining the Hsawngsup State, flows in a southerly direction till it reaches 24\u00b0 N., when it suddenly bends eastwards and pierces the Yoma, to join the Chindwin 25 miles above Kindat. South of the Yu is the Myittha river, which, running in a northerly direction from Pakokku District, turns abruptly east at Kalemyo, and empties itself into the Chindwin at Kalewa. The Uyu river rises in Myitkyina District, flows past the jade-mines, enters the Upper Chindwin District at its extreme north-east corner, and winds through a sparsely populated valley to meet the Chindwin at Homalin. The vast tract in the angle formed by the Uyu and the Chindwin is for the most part a desolate waste of hills. Near Mingin in the extreme south of the District the Chindwin is joined by the Patolon, which flows northwards from the Lower Chindwin District.\n\nAll the rocks which occur belong to the Tertiary system, but little is known regarding the details of the geology of the District. Nummulitic (eocene) limestones and shales occur west of the river, followed to the east by shales and sandstones of miocene age. East of the river the ground is occupied by Upper Tertiary (pliocene) sandstones. There is a coal-bearing area in the west. The recent sandstone is of brown or yellow tint, and gives way easily to the combined action of rain and air. The older is of a bluish-grey colour, finely grained, and of a hardness which would render it an exceedingly good material for building purposes. Conglomerate occurs in the country between the Myittha and Yu rivers, and probably elsewhere. It consists chiefly of rolled pebbles of white quartzite, among which are mixed in smaller quantities blood-red jasper and black hornstone. It does not disintegrate so readily as the sandstone, and forms a kind of embankment or escarpment along the western side of the Kale range. Clay and shales occur in the coal-bearing area. The coal is found in beds of half an inch to 12 feet in thickness. The greater number of seams occur in the valley of the Mawku stream, in which Dr. Noetling estimates that there are not less than 40 seams with a total thickness of 80 feet.\n\nThe District is richly forested and timber abounds in infinite variety. The most characteristic trees are the in (Dipterocarpus tuberculatus), the teak, the ingyin (Pentacme siamensis), and the stately kanyin (Dipterocarpus alatus). Bamboos of every kind abound, the graceful tineea (Cephalostachyum pergracile) being perhaps the most characteristic species; and orchids, ferns, wild roses, and other wild flowers are found everywhere.\nThe elephant, rhinoceros, tiger, leopard, bison, tsine or hsaing (Bos sondaicus), bear, and sambar are all to be met with, but comparatively little is really known of the vast areas of jungle that the District contains. The result of the operations of the Khedda department in the adjoining District of Kath\u0101 appears to indicate that the number of elephants in the Upper Chindwin is very considerable. A handsome variety of the tiger-cat is occasionally met with. Peafowl abound throughout the District, being especially plentiful in the lower reaches of the Uyu, and both the peacock pheasant and the silver pheasant are found in the north.\n\nAs might be expected in a region lying between four degrees of latitude, there is a noticeable difference of temperature between the north and the south of the District; but observations have hitherto been made only at Kindat, where the thermometer averages $70^\\circ$ to $95^\\circ$ in the hot season and $55^\\circ$ to $80^\\circ$ in the cold. The highest records have been $108^\\circ$ in May, 1897, $106^\\circ$ in May, 1898, and $107^\\circ$ in May, 1899, while in the extreme north the minimum, even in the plains, is not far off freezing-point in the winter. The portions of the District bordering on the Chindwin are fairly healthy, but the inland parts, and in particular the Kale, Kabaw, and Uyu valleys, are abnormally malarious and pestilential.\n\nThe rainfall varies from an average of 50 inches at Mingin, bordering on the dry zone, to 92 inches at Homalin in the north and at Tamu among the hills on the western border. As a rule the supply is plentiful and timely, but in 1891\u20132 the rainfall all over the District was neither, and at Mingin prices rose to more than double the ordinary rate; 1896\u20137 was another bad year of scanty rainfall; the Chindwin also failed to rise, and irrigated crops perished accordingly. There was, however, no famine. Floods are rare; but in October, 1901, the Yu river rose to an unprecedented height in the Kabaw valley, and destroyed five villages, happily without loss of life. In 1905 there was an exceptional rise in the Chindwin.\n\nUnder Burmese rule the Upper Chindwin was administered by a wun, known as the Khampat wun, who had his head-quarters at Kindat, then a military post, and exercised very extensive powers.\n\n**History.**\n\nOn the outbreak of war in 1885, three English assistants of the Bombay Burma Trading Corporation were murdered on the launch *Chindwin* near Mingin, and shortly after this the Political Agent of Manipur marched to Kindat through the Kabaw valley and rescued two other agents of the company. In 1886 the Deputy-Commissioner steamed up the river, meeting with some slight resistance at Balet and Masein, and received the submission of the Hsawnghsup Sawbwa. A few posts were established on the river, but nothing was done on this occasion to occupy the interior except in the Kabaw\nvalley, where Tanu continued to be held by British troops from Manipur. At first it was intended to hand over the Kabaw valley to Manipur, but the people objected so strongly to the proposed measure that the project was abandoned. Except in the Kabaw valley itself, which was finally pacified in 1887, no organized resistance was shown to British administration in the Upper Chindwin District, and dacoits as a rule gave less trouble here than elsewhere. In 1886, however, Mr. Gleeson, Assistant Commissioner, was treacherously murdered at Mingin; and in 1888 Nga Saga, a follower of the Shwegyobyu pretender, headed an outbreak in the Mingin subdivision, which was speedily quelled. In the latter year the Upper and Lower Chindwin, which had been a single District administered from Alon, were divided into two Districts, with head-quarters at Kindat and Monywa respectively. For a long time after annexation the neighbourhood of the Kale valley was much disturbed. At the time of the occupation of Upper Burma, the Sawbwa of the Shan State of Kale was at war with his nephew Pa Gyi; and the Siyin, Sokte, and Kanhow Chins took advantage of this strife of the kinsmen to raid the Kale and Kabaw valleys, destroying many villages and killing or carrying off their inhabitants. Pa Gyi was appointed Sawbwa, but it was not long before he started intriguing with the Shwegyobyu pretender, who had taken refuge with the Tashon Chins. The Siyins and Kanhows were severely punished in the first Chin expedition in 1888\u20139, but did not cease their raids on the Kabaw valley. (For further action taken against the Chins see Chin Hills.) In the Wuntho rebellion of 1890\u20131, the rebel Nga Le marched down from the Taungthonlon hill to Homalin, where he burnt the courthouse, and called on his relation, the Hsawnghsup Sawbwa, to assist him. The Sawbwa, however, remained actively loyal, and ranged his troops on the opposite bank at Kettha, and Nga Le was shortly afterwards hunted out of the District. Pa Gyi was deported in 1891 for complicity in this rebellion and for his intrigues with the Shwegyobyu, and the Kale State from that time forward became part of the District. In the meantime British influence was being extended in the north of the District; a military police post was set up at Tamanthi, 50 miles above Homalin on the Chindwin, in consequence of raids by Chins in the neighbourhood; and punitive expeditions were dispatched in 1892 and 1894 against various Chin tribes inhabiting the hills on the Assam border to the west of the Homalin township. In 1896 boundary pillars were set up dividing off the unadministered Chin tract in the north-west of the District; and since then no raids have been committed, though the Kaswa Chins of Piya in the north have been blockaded since 1901 for cattle-lifting on the Chindwin.\n\nThe population, excluding the quasi-independent Shan States of Hsawnghsup and Zingkaling Hkamti, was 111,533 in 1891 and 145,632\nin 1901. Including these two States it was 154,551 in 1901. Its distribution in the latter year is shown in the following table:\n\n| Township     | Area in square miles | Number of Towns | Villages | Population | Population per square mile | Percentage of variation in population between 1891 and 1901 | Number of persons able to read and write |\n|--------------|----------------------|-----------------|----------|------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Kindat       | 1,715                | 1               | 117      | 13,946     | 8                         | + 20                                                        | 4,510                                  |\n| Tamu         | 900                  |                 | 48       | 5,264      | 5                         | + 19                                                        | 1,533                                  |\n| Maein        | 1,334                |                 | 156      | 14,365     | 11                        | + 14                                                        | 4,397                                  |\n| Kalewa       | 184                  |                 | 36       | 3,535      | 19                        | + 5                                                         | 4,728                                  |\n| Kale         | 816                  |                 | 94       | 10,691     | 13                        | - 5                                                         | 6,171                                  |\n| Mingin       | 1,311                |                 | 141      | 10,941     | 15                        | - 5                                                         | 3,091                                  |\n| Kyabin       | 800                  |                 | 90       | 9,954      | 12                        | + 36                                                        | 7,428                                  |\n| Paungbyin    | 2,179                |                 | 268      | 20,409     | 10                        | + 38                                                        | 7,428                                  |\n| Homalin      | 2,524                |                 | 166      | 17,624     | 7                         | + 60*                                                       | 3,594                                  |\n| Maingkaing   | 4,665                |                 | 248      | 23,303     | 5                         | + 111*                                                      | 4,390                                  |\n| **Total British territory** | **17,038** | **1** | **1,364** | **145,032** | **9** | **+ 30** | **39,937** |\n| Hsawnghsup State | 579          |                 | 84       | 7,471      | 13                        | -                                                            | 1,986                                  |\n| Zingkaling Hkamti State | 983          |                 | 24       | 2,048      | 2                         | -                                                            | 468                                    |\n\n* The population of the Homalin and Maingkaing townships was only estimated in 1891.\n\n\u2020 Area figures revised since the Census of 1901.\n\nThe only town, Kindat, is really nothing more than a large village containing 2,417 inhabitants. The whole of the District is sparsely populated, the density decreasing towards the north. The apparently rapid increase of population since 1891 is due to a certain extent to non-enumeration in that year of the wilder tracts, and to the generally disturbed state of the country on the Katha borders that had been brought about by the Wuntho rebellion. There are nearly 2,000 Animists, and about the same number of Hindus and Musalmans, but most of the population are Buddhists. Two-thirds of the people talk Burmese, and the majority of the remainder are Shan speakers.\n\nRather more than half the total population is Burman. The Mingin subdivision in the extreme south is almost exclusively, and the Kindat and Kale subdivisions very largely, Burman. Shans come next to the Burmans in point of numbers, with a total of 67,100. They inhabit the two Shan States and the Homalin subdivision in the extreme north. There were 1,600 Chins in 1901, who are found in the neighbourhood of the Kabaw and Kale valleys and in the west of the Homalin township. A few Kachin villages lie east of the Chindwin in the semi-independent State of Zingkaling Hkamti, but they do not acknowledge the\nsuzerainty of the Sawbwa, who was advised not to attempt to enumerate them in 1901. Their total was estimated at 188. Elsewhere in the District nearly 200 Kachins were found, so that the aggregate of Kachins may be taken at a little under 400. The Indian immigrants numbered 2,300 at the last Census, comprising 1,100 Hindus and 800 Musalmans, a good many of whom were military policemen. Most of the rest are confined to Kindat, Kalewa, and Kalemyo. The population directly dependent on agriculture in 1901 was 104,195, or 67 per cent. of the total. Of this number 12,149 were supported by taungya (shifting) cultivation.\n\nThere are no missionary agencies at work and the number of the Christians (234) is small. Altogether, 200 are natives of India.\n\nApart from a few large villages where Indian traders congregate, the District is agricultural throughout. The population is poor; in some parts cultivators have to pay high rents to landlords, and in others, though the out-turn is good, they are unable to bring their crops to market owing to the lack of communications. A large export trade in paddy is carried on with Monywa, Pakokku, and Myingyan, but the profits go into the hands of middlemen. The condition of the cultivators of state land is distinctly better than that of cultivators of private land, for the latter are usually sub-tenants, pay a heavy rent, and are indebted to their landlords. In some parts, however, state land has got into the possession of non-agricultural landlords, who take as heavy a rent from their tenants as the owners of private lands. The soil in the valleys, to which regular cultivation is confined, is of alluvial formation, and is often irrigated by perennial springs. The upper layers on the slopes of the hills, where the cultivation of hill-clearings (taungyas) is carried on, consist mainly of decayed vegetable matter. Towards the south and over most of the country east of the Chindwin, the hills are barren and unsuited to taungya cultivation. The standard crop is wet-season rice, but mayin is also common. Wet-season rice is sown in July and August, transplanted in August and September, and reaped in January. In the Mingin subdivision, where the rainfall is more precarious than elsewhere, all these operations are carried on one or two months in advance of the rest of the District. Dry-season rice is sown in December or January, transplanted in February into depressions from which the water is retreating, and reaped in May. Buffaloes alone are used for working the land, and the harrow takes the place of the plough everywhere. For taungya cultivation a piece of forest land on the slope or hollow of a hill is chosen; all the undergrowth is burnt and the ground harrowed; the trees are then girdled, and their branches lopped off and piled in heaps. In May they are burnt and the ashes distributed over the fields, and the seeds sown broadcast when the first rains commence. The\ncrop is reaped in October. After three years the soil is exhausted and the cultivator moves on to a fresh clearing.\n\nThe following table shows the main agricultural statistics for 1903-4, in square miles:\n\n| Township | Total area | Cultivated | Irrigated | Forests |\n|----------|------------|------------|-----------|---------|\n| Kindat   | 1,715      | 21         |           |         |\n| Tamu     | 960        | 16         |           |         |\n| Masein   | 1,334      | 26         |           |         |\n| Kalewa   | 184        | 11         |           |         |\n| Kale     | 816        | 34         |           |         |\n| Mingin   | 1,311      | 37         |           |         |\n| Kyabin   | 800        | 18         |           |         |\n| Paungbyin| 2,719      | 40         |           |         |\n| Homalin  | 2,524      | 32         |           |         |\n| Maingkang| 4,665      | 29         |           |         |\n| **Total**| **17,028** | **264**    | **31**    | **8,230**|\n\nRice is the principal crop in both the hills and the valleys. In 1903-4 it occupied 251 square miles, of which 24 were *mayin*. Peas, beans, tobacco, sesamum, and cotton are cultivated for home consumption, but occupy quite an inconsiderable area. Tea is grown in four or five villages on the Chindwin north of Homalin, over an area which in 1903-4 amounted to nearly 1,400 acres. The seed is sown at the end of the rains and the plants mature after six years. Picking is carried on at the beginning of the rainy season, only the new leaf being plucked. After picking, the tea leaves are boiled for about fifteen minutes, and then rolled and crushed by hand. The resultant pickle is then rammed tight into hollow bamboos or bamboo baskets, in which it is sent down the river. The trade is declining yearly. A few years ago large quantities of tea seed were bought by Assam planters and exported via Manipur; but the trade has entirely ceased, because, it is said, one or two consignments went bad. Cultivation is extending rapidly, particularly in the Kale valley, which is recovering from Chin raids, and is now on the high road to its ancient prosperity. Extensions are encouraged by the low rate of assessment on state land\u2014one-tenth of the produce, which is much below the average rent paid by tenants of private lands to their landlords. In the Mingin subdivision practically all the available land has been brought under cultivation, and further expansion is impossible. The District as a whole, however, could easily support ten or twenty times its present population.\n\nNo new kinds of seed have been introduced, the people being fully content with such varieties as they possess and chary of adopting agricultural novelties. No loans have yet been granted under the Land Improvement Loans Act, but advances have been made freely to agriculturists for the purchase of buffaloes under the Agriculturists'\nLoans Act. These advances are eagerly sought after, and very rarely abused. The average amount lent during the six years ending 1904 exceeded Rs. 15,000 per annum.\n\nBuffaloes are bred and are universally used for cultivation; they are of a good type, and it is rare to see one out of condition. In the large villages natives of India keep herds of cows for milking purposes, but, unlike the cattle owned by Burmans, the beasts are usually in wretched condition. Ponies are not common, and are mostly small and weedy; and sheep and goats are rare. There is abundant grazing everywhere, and the fodder question is never likely to be acute.\n\nThe only form of irrigation practised is the diversion of the contents of the shallower streams over the adjoining fields by means of small channels. The area thus dealt with amounted to 31 square miles in 1903-4. Ordinarily, however, the rainfall is sufficient to bring the rice to maturity without artificial aid. In a year when the wet-season rice fails, the method of irrigation described above is largely resorted to for raising the mayin or dry-season rice, a crop usually thought but little of. The many streams with which the District abounds offer splendid facilities for irrigation, of which, however, the cultivator does not usually take the trouble to avail himself.\n\nIn the upper portion of the District dry-season rice is extensively grown in several large jhilis. It is estimated that the Minya jhil, if fully cultivated, would produce enough rice to feed the whole population of the Homalin subdivision for six months. Fishing is carried on in most of these stretches of water, as well as in the bed of the Chindwin, and the fishery revenue exceeds Rs. 10,000 per annum.\n\nThe District is comprised in the Upper Chindwin and Myitha Forest divisions, the former of which has its head-quarters at Kindat and the latter at Mingin. The Mansi subdivision of the Upper Chindwin division includes a small portion of Katha District. The whole District is covered with forests, and timber abounds in infinite variety. There are no less than 33 teak forests, and many fine teak-bearing tracts are not yet 'reserved.' Perhaps the most remarkable forest and the only one on level ground is the Mahamyaing, situated on an extensive plateau in the south-eastern portion of the District. It is evergreen and full of grand timber, and is known among local Burmans as the tanayi or 'great forest.' The following are the most characteristic trees: teak, which is extensively worked and exported to Rangoon by the Bombay Burma Trading Corporation; pyingado or pyin (Xylia dolabriformis), one of the hardest and most durable timbers of the Province; ingyin (Pentacme siamensis) and thitya (Shorea obtusa), both excellent for house-building; yamane (Gmelina arborea), now much used for boat-building; shaw (Sterculia sp.), from the bark of which ropes are twisted; in (Dipterocarpus tuber-\nculatus) and kanyin (D. alatus), neither of them very durable woods, but felled largely for the supply of fuel to steamers; and the thitsi or wood-oil tree (Melanorrhoea usitata), which is one of the most valuable in the forests. From the thitsi areas of the Mingin subdivision alone wood-oil to the value of about Rs. 10,000 is exported yearly to Pagan and elsewhere, to be used as lacquer. Cutch is found in the vicinity of Sihauing in the Kale valley, but it has not been much worked. A cutch Reserve has, however, recently been formed. Of other minor forest products bamboos and canes are the most important; immense quantities of them are floated yearly down the Chindwin to the Districts of the dry zone. The District contains 2,070 square miles of 'reserved,' and 6,160 of unclassed forest. The net forest revenue in 1903-4 was 3 lakhs.\n\nCoal exists in large quantities, but has been found so far in localities where it would not at present pay to work it. A portion of the carboniferous tract between the Yu and Myittha rivers was explored by Dr. Noetling, who declared the coal to be of good quality, comparing favourably with the best Indian kinds. Dr. Noetling has estimated that in this area alone, to which all the coal in the District is by no means confined, more than 100 million tons of workable coal could be obtained above the level of the Chindwin. With improved communications there seems no reason why these fields should not, in course of time, be developed. Mineral oil occurs in several places, most plentifully within the coal-bearing tracts. Gold-dust is found in the Chindwin and other streams which flow into it from the east, but appears to be most plentiful in the Uyu river and its tributaries; in fact, some of the inland villages in the Maingkaing township have had a gold currency from time immemorial. Rubies and sapphires have also been discovered on or near the Uyu. None of the above minerals, however, has as yet been systematically worked. Jade is found on the Nantaleik chaung near Tamanthi, and on the Namsam stream, which is the boundary between the Upper Chindwin and Myitkyina Districts in the extreme north-east. No stone, however, has been quarried in the mines on the Nantaleik since the annexation. Amber mines have been worked within the last ten years in the Epin valley, in the abandoned tract between Haungpa on the Uyu and the Chindwin. Pottery clay is fairly common, but is made little use of. Salt springs are found at Yebawmi on the Uyu, and boiling is carried on there to a small extent.\n\nThe District is concerned mainly with the production of raw material, and has little to show in the way of arts and manufac-\n\nTrade and communications. The only characteristic industry is the weaving of Yaw pasos (waistcloths), which is carried on at Indin and several other villages in the extreme south of the\nKale valley. These pasos are dyed with indigo grown locally, and are well-known for their excellent wearing qualities.\n\nThe chief exports are paddy, teak, wood-oil, bamboos, and beeswax. Teak is exported mainly by the Bombay Burma Trading Corporation under contract with the Government, and duty is paid on its arrival at Pakokku. It is taken down in large rafts and sold in Rangoon. In 1901 more than 1,000,000 cubic feet of teak were exported from the District. Wood-oil is extracted mainly from the thitsi forests (Melanorrhoea usitata) of the Mingin subdivision, and is shipped in boats at Maukkadaw and sold at Pagan and other centres of the manufacture of lacquer-ware. About 300 maunds, valued at Rs. 10,000, are exported yearly. The tappers are poor people from the Mingin subdivision and the borders of Shwebo District, and the profits of the industry go mainly into the pockets of middlemen. In an ordinary year the District produces more than enough rice for its own consumption, and large quantities are available for export to Lower Burma. The grain goes down mainly by river, the paddy raft, with its cluster of thatch-roofed granaries and central hut, being a familiar sight on the Chindwin. The difference in prices makes the possibilities of the rice trade large. Most of the profits are usually absorbed by the brokers. Bamboos and canes are also largely exported to the dry zone Districts. The two Shan States in the District exchange rubber, beeswax, bamboos, and paddy for salt, sesamum oil, kerosene, and piece-goods. Rubber is exported from Zingkaling Hkamti and paddy from Hsawnghsup, and some of the jade extracted from the mines in Myitkyina District passes by river through Kindat on its way south. There is very little trade with Manipur and Assam; but the tribes in the unadministered tract on the border come down at times with beeswax, which is bartered for salt and iron, and exported eventually to Mandalay.\n\nThe principal imports are salt, iron, and silk and cotton goods of European manufacture. The Irrawaddy Flotilla Company's steamers, which on the Chindwin are practically floating bazars, bring up large quantities of salt during the rains, when the river is high, as far as Homalin, whence it is distributed by boats, and finds its way as far north as the tribes who live beyond the Chindwin waterfall, close to the borders of Assam.\n\nThere are no railway lines, but the District possesses about 400 miles of unmetalled roads, maintained chiefly from Provincial funds. The most important of these are the road to the Kabaw valley and Manipur via Sittaung and Tamu; that to the Chin Hills via Kalewa and Kalemyo; the track from Kindat to Homalin via Paungbyin; the road to the Yaw valley via Mingin, Seiktha, and Pya (kept up mainly by the Forest department); and that to the Kabaw valley via Mawku and Teinkaya (maintained entirely by the Forest department). In the Hsawnghsup\nState one track connects Tamu and Hsawnghsup, and a second from Hsawnghsup leads over the hills to Manipur. A path available for mules in the dry season leads from Hkamti on the Chindwin to Haungpa on the Uyu. During the rains, however, land communications are defective, and at all times waterways play an almost more important part in the economy of the District. The Chindwin, running through the entire length of the District, is its main highway. During the rains it is navigable by steamers of 4 feet draught almost up to the rapids, nearly 600 miles from its junction with the Irrawaddy, while in the dry season shallow-draught stern-wheelers can go beyond Tamanthi, about 400 miles from its mouth. The Uyu and Myittha rivers are deep enough for small launches during a portion of the rainy season, the former for 150 miles from its mouth, the latter for some little distance into the Kale valley. The steamers of the Irrawaddy Flotilla Company ply weekly between Pakokku and Homalin, and Government launches run weekly between Mandalay and Homalin. The chief indigenous method of inland navigation is by means of country boats called londwins. The Chindwin, the Myittha, the Yu, and the Uyu are navigable by these the whole year round.\n\nFor administrative purposes the District is divided into four subdivisions: Kindat, comprising the Kindat and Tamu townships; Kale, comprising the Masein, Kalewa, and Kale townships; Mingin, comprising the Mingin and Kyabin townships; and Homalin, comprising the Paungbyin, Homalin, and Maingkaing townships. Under the township officers are 4 myothugnis and 454 village headmen, 21 of whom are empowered to try petty civil disputes. The two Shan States are administered by their own Sawbwas much in the same way as other Shan States, but in certain matters they are under the control of the Deputy-Commissioner. The subdivisional officer at Homalin discharges in these States all the functions of an Assistant Superintendent of the Shan States. The District forms a subdivision of the Chindwin Public Works division, the Executive Engineer having his head-quarters at Monywa in the Lower Chindwin District.\n\nThe Deputy-Commissioner and the subdivisional and township officers preside over the District, subdivisional, and township courts. The civil courts are mostly concerned with money-lending transactions of a petty nature; but wherever public works are in progress on a large scale, a crop of civil suits arising out of disputes between contractors and coolies invariably springs up. Litigation of this nature is commonest at Kalemyo, where there is always some road-work in progress. Suits for large sums are rare. In order to provide facilities for laying appeals in the remoter parts of the District, the subdivisional officer of Homalin has been made an additional judge of the District court.\nCrime is light, the people being quiet and law-abiding, especially the Shan population in the northern half of the District. Opium cases alone are common, most of the Shans being addicted to the drug, while smuggled Shan and Kachin opium is very easy to procure. The amounts seized are, however, usually small, the average being 4 to 5 tolas.\n\nShortly after annexation a *thathameda* tax of Rs. 10 per household was imposed on the inhabitants, and has been collected at about this rate ever since. In 1887\u20138 the total realizations from *thathameda* amounted to Rs. 80,600. In 1891\u20132 the District was finally pacified, and the demand rose to Rs. 2,23,000. It reached its highest in 1893\u20134, when it touched Rs. 2,69,000. In 1903\u20134 it fell to Rs. 2,65,000, the decrease being due to steps taken to avoid an over-minute subdivision of households. As soon as the District officers had time to turn their attention from the work of pacifying the country to revenue matters, inquiries began to be made as to the existence of state land. The first regular assessment of land revenue was in 1888\u20139, the demand from state land being a fixed proportion of the gross produce varying from 20 to 30 per cent., based on the rates paid in the neighbourhood by tenants of non-state land to their landlords. At first it was collected in kind, stored at the cultivators\u2019 risk, and sold when the market was favourable. The demand in 1888\u20139 was only Rs. 2,000. In the ensuing year an effort was made to prevail on the agriculturists to pay their revenue in money instead of in kind, but the attempt was not altogether successful. In 1891 great difficulty was experienced in collection, the year being one of considerable scarcity all over the District, and in 1892 the demand was fixed at one-quarter of the produce and collected in money. Again there were obstacles in the way of realization, and indeed the revenue was never collected in full. The people of the Kale valley, from whom the Kale Sawbwa used to take no fixed revenue at all but only such sums as he might from time to time happen to want, were the most stubborn opponents of taxation. In 1893\u20134 the demand was Rs. 57,000, and the arrears Rs. 44,000; in 1894\u20135, out of a demand of Rs. 21,000, there were arrears to the extent of Rs. 13,500. In time it was found not only that the revenue rates were pitched too high, but also that the collections were made before the cultivator had time to dispose of his crops to the best advantage. In 1895\u20136 the rate was reduced to 10 per cent. of the out-turn, yielding only Rs. 17,000; and at this rate revenue has been collected ever since without difficulty. In the following year the whole of the Homalin subdivision was declared state land and assessed to revenue, the total District demand being Rs. 45,000. Since then up to 1900\u20131 there has been a small increase, due to extensions of cultivation. There has been no regular settlement.\nThe table below exhibits, in thousands of rupees, the fluctuations in the revenue during a succession of years. *Thathameda* is for the present the main source of revenue, yielding Rs. 2,65,000 in 1903-4.\n\n|                | 1890-1 | 1900-1 | 1901-4 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Land revenue   | 3      | 56     | 80     |\n| Total revenue  | ...    | 4,33   | 4,97   |\n\nThe income of the District fund for the provision and maintenance of roads, *d\u0101k*-bungalows, &c., amounted in 1903-4 to only Rs. 3,000. The poverty of the fund is due to the failure of the attempt to make the people patronize Government bazars, the most fruitful source of District fund income elsewhere. No municipalities have been constituted.\n\nThe four police subdivisions under the control of the District Superintendent of police correspond to the four administrative subdivisions. An inspector supervises each of the subdivisions of Homalin, Kale, and Mingin, and an Assistant District Superintendent is ordinarily in charge of the Kindat subdivision. There are 11 police stations and 8 outposts; and the force consists of 4 inspectors, 11 head constables, 24 sergeants, and 302 constables. An assistant commandant and 640 men of the Chindwin military police battalion are stationed in the District, 514 of the men being natives of India and 126 Karens; but the strength of the force is reduced to 400 in the rains. About 200 to 300 military police are stationed in the extreme north as a protection against wild tribes, about 100 in Kindat, and the rest mainly at township and subdivisional head-quarters. There is a District jail at Kindat, with accommodation for 100 prisoners. The convicts are mainly employed in grinding wheat for the military police.\n\nIt is a curious fact that in 1891 the Upper Chindwin showed a larger proportion of males able to read and write than any other District in Burma, and that in 1901 it came second only to Minbu in this regard. Our knowledge of the actual conditions obtaining in the District leaves no doubt, however, that the literacy of the Upper Chindwin males in 1891 and 1901 must have been of the most primitive description. As a matter of fact, education in its stricter sense has so far made hardly any progress, and until quite recently the Upper and Lower Chindwin Districts were under the charge of a single deputy-inspector of schools. Since 1902, however, a separate deputy-inspector has been appointed for the Upper Chindwin, and it is hoped that an advance will now be made in education. For the District as a whole the proportion of literate persons was 27\u00b75 per cent. (53 males and 2 females) of the population in 1901. The number of pupils was 623 in 1891, 2,516 in 1901, and\n3,757 in 1904 (including 130 girls). In 1903-4 there were 30 primary and 343 elementary (private) schools. The only Anglo-veracular (primary) school is at Kindat, and contains about 20 pupils. The expenditure on education is met by a grant of Rs. 1,800 from Provincial funds.\n\nThe Upper Chindwin is well off for medical institutions, containing 6 civil hospitals with 56 beds. In 1903 the number of cases treated was 30,785, including 573 in-patients, and 291 operations were performed. The expenditure amounted to Rs. 11,000, made up, with the exception of Rs. 850 from subscriptions, entirely of grants from Government. At the three military police hospitals 1,560 cases were treated in 1903, including 29 in-patients, and 11 operations were performed.\n\nVaccination is progressing, though much yet remains to be done, and it is nowhere compulsory. In 1903-4 the number of persons successfully vaccinated was 10,410, representing 67 per 1,000 of the population.\n\n[F. Noetling, *The Coal Fields of the Upper Chindwin* (1893).]\n\n**Chindwin River.**\u2014The most important tributary of the Irrawaddy in Burma. Its source is as yet undetermined, as it is by no means certain whether the Tanai or the Tawan stream, which unite to form the main river, is to be taken as the chief source; but it may be said to have its origin in the hills that surround the Hukawng valley in the extreme north of the Province at about the 27th parallel of latitude. Little is known of the river during its passage in a westerly and south-westerly direction through the Hukawng valley. At the southern end of the valley its course is interrupted by falls or rapids, and about this point it enters the small Shan State of Zingkaling Hkamti and the Upper Chindwin District. Its first affluent below the rapids is the Uyu, which rises in the Jade Mines tract to the east, and flows into the main stream a few miles below the town of Homalin. Thence, for some distance, the Chindwin forms the eastern boundary of the Shan State of Hsawnghsup. At about the 24th parallel of latitude the Yu enters it from the Kabaw (Kubo) valley on the west, and a few miles below this junction it passes Kindat, the head-quarters of the Upper Chindwin District, which lies on its left bank. Kalewa, about 40 miles farther down on its right bank, is the point where the Chindwin is joined by the Myittha river from the Chin country in the west. So far its course has been on the whole southerly. At Mingin, however, a town on its right bank, it bends to the east and then to the north, after which, at the village of Maukkadaw, it curves to the south again and passes from the Upper into the Lower Chindwin District. Soon after crossing the border, the character of the country on the banks changes. In the Upper Chindwin the valley is for the most part narrow; for long stretches wooded hills slope sheer down to the water's edge, and where the high ground falls back from the river, the levels are a mass of kaing-\ngrass jungle; population is sparse, and villages are few and far between. South of Maukkadaw the valley widens out, the hills retire, hamlets multiply, and broad level plains are covered with crops typical of the dry zone. After passing Kani on the right bank and Alon, the terminus of the Sagaing-Alon Railway, on the left, Monywa, the head-quarters of the Lower Chindwin District (also on the left bank), is reached. South of Monywa the river forms the boundary between Sagaing and Pakokku Districts, flows past the market towns of Amyin and Vesagyo, and eventually empties itself into the Irrawaddy about half-way between the towns of Pakokku and Myingyan. The Chindwin is altogether between 500 and 600 miles in length. For more than 400 miles it is navigable during certain seasons of the year for steam traffic. The steamers of the Irrawaddy Flotilla Company run the whole year round as high as Kindat, 200 miles from its mouth, and during the rains as high as Homalin, about 130 miles farther up the stream. Country boats ply freely through its whole length, both above and below the rapids, and it is utilized largely for rafting. The banks of the river are used for the cultivation of tobacco and other kaing crops. In its lower reaches water-wheels are here and there used for lifting water to the level of the fields on the banks; and in the neighbourhood of the Irrawaddy there are a few minor village irrigation works which depend for their water-supply on the main stream, but the latter has not yet been worked systematically for irrigation purposes. There are no bridges over the Chindwin, and no ferries of more than local importance.\n\nChingleput District (Sengalunirpattu, or 'water-lily brook').\u2014District on the east coast of the Madras Presidency, lying between $12^\\circ 15'$ and $13^\\circ 47'$ N. and $79^\\circ 34'$ and $80^\\circ 21'$ E., with an area of 3,079 square miles. It is bounded on the east by the Bay of Bengal; on the north by Nellore; and on the west and south by North and South Arcot; and it encloses within its limits Madras City, the capital of the Province.\n\nPhysical aspects. The District is flat and dreary near the sea, but undulating, and in some places even hilly, elsewhere. The scenery contains little to attract the eye in any of the three northern taluks of Saidapet, Ponneri, and Tiruvallur, except where, in the extreme north of the last, the N\u0101galapuram hills and the ridge of which the highest peak is the well-known Kambakkam Drug contribute a few picturesque effects. These are the only hills of any size in the District. The height of Kambakkam Drug is 2,548 feet above sea-level, and that of the N\u0101galapuram hills about 2,500 feet. The Conjeeveram taluk is also marked by little to relieve the monotony. Parts of the Chingleput and the Madurantakam taluks are, however, quite pretty, consisting of undulating plains varied by small ridged or conical hills running up to an elevation of some 600 feet.\n\nThe river system of the District consists of a series of streams which\nflow across it from west to east into the Bay of Bengal. The largest of these is the Palar, which rises in the State of Mysore, flows through North Arcot, enters Chingleput some miles to the west of Conjeeveram, and after running right across the District in a south-easterly direction falls into the sea 3 miles to the south of Sadras. The next most important river is the Korttalaiyar, which flows from the surplus weir of the great tank at Kaveripak in North Arcot District, similarly traverses Chingleput from west to east, and falls into the backwater at Ennore, a few miles north of Madras City. The Araniya Nadi or Arani river enters the District in the north of the Tiruvallur taluk, where it is known as the Naranavaram. After flowing across the centre of the Tiruvallur and Ponneri taluks, it reaches the sea near Pulicat. The Cooum (Kuvam) is formed by the surplus water of the Kuvam tank, and after flowing through the Saidapet taluk and Madras City falls into the sea near Fort St. George. Besides these there are the two smaller streams of the Cheyyar and the Adyar. The antagonism between the languid waters of these rivers and the sand-laden currents of the Bay have resulted in the formation of a string of brackish backwaters along the coast, the chief of which are the Pulicat and Ennore Lakes. These are connected by the Buckingham Canal. None of them is navigable, and for most of the year the smaller ones are dry.\n\nGeologically the country is of some interest. The Archaean gneissic and plutonic rocks are to be seen emerging from beneath the younger sedimentaries in the south-western and southern parts of it. They include the typical examples of the charnockite series as developed at St. Thomas's Mount and Pallavaram, where the acid or quartz-bearing form of the hypersthene granulite is found in contact with the basic or norite form. Presumably lying on the Archaeans, though the base is not seen, come representatives of the Upper Gondwana plant-bearing shales in a small outcrop 25 miles west-south-west of Madras City, and other very small patches south of the Palar river lying directly on the gneiss. They belong to the local series named the Sriperumbudur group, composed of white shales containing plants associated with sandstones and micaceous sandy shales and conglomerates; and they contain some ill-preserved ammonites and bivalves, as well as plants, which may indicate affinity with the Neocomian rather than the Jurassic series. They are nearly horizontally disposed, of no great thickness, and probably represent the lower part of the Upper Gondwanas as developed a short distance to the north-west in North Arcot District. From a boring in Place's Garden near Madras it would seem that Lower Gondwanas (with a remote chance of coal) underlie the Upper Gondwanas, at least locally. Unconformably above the Upper Gondwanas and overstepping on to the gneisses in other places comes a very thin bed of low-level conglomeratic laterite, from 10 inches to 12 feet thick, together\nwith laterite red sands and loams. These occur in patches (as in the Red Hills north-west of Madras City), and are the remains of a once continuous horizontal formation, probably of marine origin, lying from 500 to 600 feet above sea-level and cut through by recent river alluvium. They contain stone (quartzite) implements. Alluvial areas in the river-beds and along the coast, together with blown sand, complete the list of surface deposits.\n\nThe flora of Chingleput presents few points of interest. The rainfall and altitude of the District are almost uniform, and thus the plants found throughout it resemble those of similar areas on the east coast. The forest trees and the crops are referred to below. The most noticeable trees among the villages are the palmyra palm and the casuarina. The latter has been planted extensively all along the belt of sandy soil which fringes the sea-coast.\n\nWild animals of the larger kinds are scarce. An occasional tiger, a few leopards, and some bears are found in the north of the Tiruvallur taluk among the hills, and also spotted deer and sambhar in small numbers. Wild hog are fairly numerous there, and in the low hills and scrub jungle in the Chingleput taluk. The District is famous for its snipe-shooting, which is systematically exploited by residents of Madras, and florican are more than usually common.\n\nThe climate, considering the latitude, is temperate, and resembles that of other coast Districts in the south of the Province in presenting no extremes of heat or cold. The mean annual temperature of Madras City, which lies in the centre of the District, is 83\u00b0. It is a healthy tract on the whole, though fever is endemic in the west in some places, and in the east leprosy and elephantiasis are prevalent.\n\nThe rainfall is neither copious nor very regular. The annual fall throughout averages 45 inches, but this varies much in different localities. The supply is greatest (51 inches) in the coast taluks, next heaviest in the adjoining areas, and lightest (43 inches) in the westernmost parts. The reason for these variations is that the greater part of the annual supply is received from the north-east monsoon, and this has parted with some of its moisture by the time it has traversed the eastern side of the District. No rain sufficient for cultivation usually arrives in April and May. In the south-west monsoon (June to September) the early 'dry' (unirrigated) crops are grown. The most important cultivation is that carried out with the north-east rains, which fill the tanks (artificial irrigation reservoirs) and enable the 'wet' (or irrigated) crops to be put down. The District has suffered comparatively little from famine, but has had more than its share of disastrous hurricanes and cyclones. Accounts of some of these will be found in the article on MADRAS CITY.\n\nFrom the earliest times of which there is any record up to the middle\nof the eighth century, Chingleput formed part of the ancient kingdom of the Pallavas, whose capital was K\u0101nchi, the modern Conjeveram. The authorities are divided as to who these Pallavas were and whence they came. During the height of their power, about the beginning of the seventh century, they ruled over a great kingdom extending from the Narbad\u0101 and Orissa in the north to the Ponnaiy\u0101r river in the south, and from the Bay of Bengal on the east to a line drawn through Salem, Bangalore, and Berar on the west. The famous monolithic temples and r\u0101this at Mah\u0101balipur, better known as the Seven Pagodas, on the coast nearly due east of Chingleput town, are attributed to them.\n\nAbout 760 the Pallavas became extinct as a ruling power, and Chingleput then passed under the Western Gangas of Mysore. The Rashtrak\u016btas of M\u0101lkhed, in the present Niz\u0101m\u2019s Dominions, invaded the District and took K\u0101nchi in the beginning of the ninth and again in the middle of the tenth century. Shortly afterwards Chingleput became part of the country of the Cholas, whose greatest ruler, R\u0101j\u0101raja Deva, was then at the height of his power. On the decline of the Cholas about the middle of the thirteenth century, the District passed under the K\u0101katiyas of Warangal, and a line of later Cholas ruled over K\u0101nchi and the surrounding country, with one slight interruption, as their vassals. About 1393 it was absorbed into the kingdom of Vijayanagar, which was then extending its hold over all Southern India, and with little or no interruption continued to be part of that realm for over a century and a half.\n\nOn the overthrow of the Vijayanagar dynasty by the combined Muhammadan kings of the Deccan at the battle of T\u0101likot\u0101 in 1565, it came into the hands of one of the deputies of the fallen kingdom, who continued to pay allegiance to the fugitive king of Vijayanagar after his flight to Chandragiri, in North Arcot District. From a later deputy the English received, in 1639, the grant of the site on which Fort St. George now stands. Shortly afterwards the whole of southeast India was overrun by the Kutb Sh\u0101hi Sult\u0101ns of Golconda. The Naiks (as the deputies were called) of Chingleput remained the vassals of these new conquerors, and their dealings with the English at Madras are prominent points in the early history of Fort St. George.\n\nOn the fall of Golconda in 1687 Chingleput passed, with the rest of the Carnatic, under the rule of the Mughal emperors at Delhi. During the Carnatic Wars of the eighteenth century Chingleput and other towns and villages in the District were the objects of repeated attacks, and figure constantly in the story of these troublous times. In 1763 the District, which then included some of the villages now forming part of Madras City, was granted in perpetuity as a j\u0101g\u012br to the East India Company by Muhammad Ali, the Naw\u0101b of Arcot, in considera-\ntion of the services rendered to him by the English, and in 1765 the grant was confirmed by the Mughal emperor. The old records always call the District 'the J\u00e2gr\u00ee.' For the next fifteen years it was leased annually to the Naw\u00e2b himself, and during that time Haidar Ali, who had by then usurped all sovereign authority in Mysore, devastated it twice, in 1769 and again in 1780. On the assignment of the revenues of the Carnatic to the English by the Naw\u00e2b of Arcot in 1781, it was placed under the charge of the Committee of Assigned Revenues. In 1801 it became part of the British dominions in India on the cession of the Carnatic in full sovereignty to the Company by the Naw\u00e2b. Besides the territory thus acquired, Chingleput includes the town of Pulicat, the earliest Dutch possession in India (founded in 1609), which was ceded to the British in 1825.\n\nThe oldest objects of archaeological interest in the District are the rude stone monuments, relics of the Kurumbas and earlier prehistoric races, which are found in considerable numbers. The monolithic buildings at the Seven Pagodas, the legends connected with St. Thomas's Mount, the old Dutch Settlements at Pulicat and Sadras, and the antiquities at Conjeeveram are referred to in the respective articles on these places.\n\nThe District is made up of six taluks, the head-quarters of which are at the places from which they are respectively named. Statistics of these, for the census year 1901, are appended:\n\n| Taluk       | Area in square miles | Number of Towns | Villages | Population | Population per square mile | Percentage of variation in population between 1891 and 1901 | Number of persons able to read and write |\n|-------------|---------------------|-----------------|----------|------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Tiruvallur  | 744                 | 1               | 464      | 253,973    | 341                       | + 7.2                                           | 13,724                                 |\n| Ponneri     | 347                 | 1               | 240      | 136,597    | 394                       | + 11.6                                          | 7,803                                  |\n| Saidapet    | 342                 | 6               | 254      | 262,478    | 767                       | + 16.9                                          | 24,869                                 |\n| Chingleput  | 436                 | 2               | 298      | 155,213    | 356                       | + 13.1                                          | 13,092                                 |\n| Conjeeveram | 514                 | 2               | 304      | 225,300    | 438                       | + 3.0                                           | 22,416                                 |\n| Madurantakam| 696                 | 3               | 524      | 278,561    | 400                       | + 5.9                                           | 19,966                                 |\n\nDistrict total | 3,079               | 15              | 2,144    | 1,312,122  | 426                       | + 9.1                                           | 101,870                                |\n\nThe District head-quarters are at SAIDAPET. Chingleput is the smallest District in the Presidency except Madras City, the Nilgiris, and Anjengo; but the density of the population of every taluk is considerably above the average for the Presidency as a whole, and in Saidapet, which surrounds Madras and contains several villages which are practically suburbs of that city, it is as high as 767 persons per square mile. The total population of the District in 1871 was 938,184; in 1881, 981,381; in 1891, 1,202,928; and in 1901, 1,312,122. Since the first\nof these years it has increased by one-third, and in the last decade the rate of growth was above the average for the Province and in the Saida-pet taluk was as high as 17 per cent. Immigration from North Arcot is considerable, but is more than counterbalanced by the movement from the District itself into Madras City. The villages in Chingleput are usually small, averaging only 524 inhabitants apiece. It contains fifteen towns, of which two, Conjeeveram (population, 46,164) and Chingleput (10,551), are municipalities, and the others are Unions.\n\nOf the people of Chingleput, 1,255,257, or 96 per cent., are Hindus, 30,010 are Musalmans, and 26,466 are Christians. These last increased at the rate of 40 per cent. during the last decade. The District is one of seven in the Presidency in which, for some reason which has never been satisfactorily explained, females, contrary to the usual rule, are fewer than males. Though it really belongs to the Tamil country, it marches with Telugu Districts on the north and west, and in its north-western taluk, Tiruvallur, Telugu is the prevailing vernacular. In the District as a whole, nearly a fourth of the people speak Telugu, and about three-fourths Tamil.\n\nOwing to its proximity to Madras City, Chingleput contains a high proportion of Europeans and Eurasians. The Hindus include 1,021,000 Tamils and 217,000 Telugus. Of the former as many as 321,000 belong to the low caste of Paraiyans, and the high proportion of this community to the total population is one of the most notable facts in the social constitution of the District. The Pallis\u2014who, like the Paraiyans, are mainly agricultural labourers\u2014also occur in great strength, numbering as many as 262,000. Other castes which, though not remarkable numerically, are found in greater strength in Chingleput than elsewhere are the Pandarams, a class of Saivite priests and religious beggars many of whom officiate at the domestic ceremonies of the Vellalas; the Pattanavans, fishermen; the Vedans, who are shikaris and agriculturists; and the Kannadiyans, a Kanarese caste of shepherds and cattle-breeders most of whom are Lingayats by sect.\n\nThe District is notorious for the disputes which occur in it, and especially at Conjeeveram, between the Vadagalai and Tengalai sub-sects of the Vaishnavite Hindus. The chief points of doctrinal difference between them are as follows: The Vadagalais prefer to read sacred books and chant in Sanskrit, while the Tengalais, although revering that language, attach greater value to their own vernacular. The Vadagalais believe the attainment of salvation to be aided by devotions, ritual, and good works; the Tengalais assert it to be of grace alone. The former worship Lakshmi, the consort of Vishnu, as a goddess equal in power to her husband; the latter condemn this practice and insist that the goddess can only intercede. The Vadagalais\nbegin their prayers with praise of Ved\u0101nta Desika (a saint born at Conjeeveram), while the Tengalais begin theirs with praise of the saint Manav\u0101lam\u0101muni.\n\nThe occupations of the people of Chingleput differ little from the normal. The District is somewhat less exclusively agricultural than the average, but the reason for this is merely that there are many fishermen along the coast.\n\nOf the 26,466 Christians in the District in 1901, 23,714 were natives of India and 2,752 Europeans and Eurasians. Two-thirds of them are Roman Catholics. The Wesleyan, United Free Church of Scotland, and London Missions are the chief Protestant missions at work. The Wesleyan Mission carries on its operations in the Madur\u0101ntakam and Saidapet taluks, and the Free Church Mission in Chingleput, Conjeeveram, and Ponneri. These bodies maintain a large number of schools for Hindus and Panchamas (depressed castes) of both sexes. Their work among the Panchamas is partly religious, partly social, and partly educational. They have lent their assistance to enable thrifty individuals to hold land, the missions themselves in some cases buying or holding this for them; and the United Free Church Mission has founded three peasant settlements to improve the condition of the community. The principal of these is Melrosapuram, within an easy drive of Chingleput, which was started in 1893. Here is a school in which boys are taught agriculture, the extraction of plantain fibre, ropemaking, and blacksmiths' work, so that they may be able to mend their implements. The valuable experiments in well-irrigation which have been made here are referred to below.\n\nThere are three classes of soil in the District\u2014black, red, and arenaceous\u2014each of which has three varieties: namely, loam, clay, and sand. In each class the loam is considered the best Agriculture, and the sand the worst. The black and the red soils are well suited for cultivation, the black being generally the more fertile of the two; but the arenaceous soil, which occurs in a wide strip all along the sea-shore, is fit only for the plantations of casuarina which abound in the coast villages. The red soil predominates in the northern taluks of Tiruvall\u016br, Ponneri, and Saidapet, while the black soil is commonest in the south\u2014in Chingleput, Conjeeveram, and Madur\u0101ntakam. The southern portion of the District is consequently more fertile than the northern. September is the month in which the sowing of the crops chiefly takes place, one-fourth of the 'dry' land and nearly one-third of the 'wet' land being planted then. Next in importance for sowing comes October.\n\nThe District is principally ryotw\u0101ri land, but samind\u0101ri and 'whole in\u0101m' areas cover as much as 950 square miles out of the total of 3,079. For these, detailed statistics are not available, and the area for\nwhich particulars are on record is 2,435 square miles. In 1903-4 this was made up as shown below, areas being in square miles:\n\n| Taluk       | Area shown in accounts | Forests | Cultivable waste | Cultivated | Irrigated |\n|-------------|------------------------|---------|------------------|------------|-----------|\n| Tiruvallur  | 436                    | 104     | 38               | 216        | 121       |\n| Ponneri     | 308                    | 6       | 9                | 173        | 96        |\n| Saidapet    | 311                    | 14      | 10               | 208        | 101       |\n| Chingleput  | 382                    | 65      | 31               | 164        | 95        |\n| Conjeeveram | 447                    | 8       | 11               | 276        | 150       |\n| Madurantakam| 531                    | 17      | 35               | 299        | 139       |\n| **Total**   | **2,435**              | **214** | **134**          | **1,335**  | **702**   |\n\nOf the cultivable waste a large proportion is very poor soil, but a considerable area may be expected to come gradually under cultivation as population increases.\n\nThe staple food-grains of the District are rice and r\u014dgi (Eleusine coracana), the areas under which were 927 and 97 square miles respectively, or, taken together, three-fourths of the total extent sown in 1903-4. The other crops chiefly cultivated are varagu (Paspalum scrobiculatum), indigo, gingelly, cambo (Pennisetum typhoideum), and ground-nut. Varagu is mostly cultivated in the Madurantakam taluk on inferior sorts of 'dry' land; indigo, cambo, and ground-nut chiefly in the Tiruvallur taluk; and gingelly in Conjeeveram and Madurantakam.\n\nMethods of cultivation are the reverse of careful. Much of the soil is poor, and much of the land is held by absentee landlords, who sublet it to cultivators whose means are small and whose tenancy is insecure. Good farming is thus a rarity, manuring and weeding are neglected, and much of the District has a poverty-stricken appearance. At Saidapet is the Government Agricultural College, but it cannot be claimed that the ryots have profited by its teachings. In one direction, however, there are signs of improvement, and that is in the number of wells which have recently been dug or repaired. In the sixteen years ending 1904 more than 5\u00bd lakhs was borrowed by the ryots under the Land Improvement Loans Act for this purpose. The farm-school at Melrosapuram belonging to the Free Church Mission, which has already been alluded to, has conducted valuable experiments on the capabilities of wells equipped with pumping machinery, which ought to do much to extend this form of irrigation. A well on the farm was fitted with an oil-engine of 3\u00bd horse-power and a pump; it was deepened and four adits made at the bottom; and a new well was sunk close by to serve as a storage basin and joined to the other by another adit. By these means the inflow was greatly increased, and with the help of the pump the well was made to irrigate twenty acres.\ninstead of five. It is considered certain that this area is capable of further extension. Valuable crops such as sugar-cane and plantains are now grown by this means, and the value of the produce is from eight to twenty times what it formerly was. Large quantities of manure and tank silt are used on the land. Around the well are hundreds of valuable fruit trees, which give the place a flourishing appearance. The ryots of the District have taken much interest in these experiments; and Government has sanctioned the establishment in other places of five schools similar to that at Melrosapuram, and is also conducting further experiments in the use of pumping machinery in connexion with wells.\n\nNo breed of cattle is peculiar to Chingleput. Those raised locally are mostly inferior, as there are few good grazing-grounds. The best cattle are imported from the adjoining Districts. The goats and sheep are of the ordinary varieties.\n\nOf the total area of ryotwari and 'minor inam' lands cultivated in 1903-4 (1,335 square miles), 702 square miles, or more than half, were irrigated. By far the larger part of this extent (619 square miles) was watered from tanks or artificial reservoirs. These number 2,553, and are mostly rain-fed. Some of them, however, are supplied from channels led from the rivers mentioned above. The most important of these are the Red Hills and Cholavaram tanks, fed from the Korttalaiy\u00e4r, which irrigate 9,054 acres in the Ponneri and Saidapet taluks, and the former of which supplies Madras-City with water; the Vallur tank in Ponneri, supplied from the Arani river; the Chembrambakkam tank in Saidapet, which is fed from the Cooum and irrigates 18,000 acres in 37 villages; and the tank at Uttaramerur, fed by the Cheyy\u00e4r. Other tanks of importance are those at Madurantakam, Karunguli, Edamichi, and Periamkolam in the Madurantakam taluk; at Siperumbudur, Tenneri, and Manimangalam in the Conjeeveram taluk; and at Tinnanur and Ambattur in Saidapet. Besides these tanks, 158 river and 340 spring channels irrigate about 50,000 and 7,350 acres respectively. Wells form an additional source of irrigation, and there are 32,650 in the District, most of which are unfailing except in years of severe drought. Water is drawn from them either by picottahs (long wooden levers with a bucket at one end, which are actuated by two, or more men walking backwards and forwards along them), or by kappilais or mots (leathern buckets pulled up by a rope and pulley, worked by bullocks).\n\nThe District has little real forest growth. There are 94 'reserved' forests, occupying 214 square miles; but they mostly consist of low scrub, except the forests about the Kambakkam and N\u0101gal\u0101puram hills in the Tiruvallur taluk, where there is some timber. The latter make up nearly half the forest area in the District. They have been under\nconservation for eighteen years, and abandoned fields included within the protected areas have become clothed with a growth of good material, which is steadily improving both in condition and in size. The other Reserves, lying in the plains, consist mostly of inferior trees and small shrubs, only capable of yielding faggot-wood, manure-leaves, and bark. The greater part of these (65 square miles) are in the Chingleput taluk. The chief value of the Reserves at present is to serve as a grazing-ground for cattle. The total net revenue realized from them in 1903-4 was Rs. 13,000. They are administered by a District Forest officer, under whom are two range officers.\n\nThe minerals of the District are few. Some years ago, on the hills round Chingleput, a good felspar, useful for glazing pottery, used to be found. The best variety was of a fresh pink colour passing into a deep purple, variegated and glistening with a curious play of colours. It is the same kind as that which used to be imported from Sicily into England. Another variety found in the same locality was called Labrador felspar. Its colours were dark, and the stone was used in Europe as an ornamental pebble. Among the hills to the north and north-west of Chingleput has been found a very scarce variety of granite. The colours were pale green, flesh-colour, grey, and black and white, and they became very brilliant when polished. Unfortunately it existed in very small quantities, but its value may be gathered from the fact that it used to command a sale in Europe in pieces as small as 4 inches by 2. It was used for pedestals for busts and for making small polished table-ornaments. No one has taken the trouble to work either the felspar or the granite, and their very existence appears to have been forgotten. In the clayey estuarine beds to the north of Madras City concretionary masses of gypsum and crystals of selenite occur, but not in any great abundance. Supplies for making plaster of Paris for use in the School of Art at Madras have, however, been obtained from this source.\n\nNext to agriculture, cotton- and silk-weaving form the most important occupations of the people. Statistics show that there are over 11,000 looms in the District, more than half of them being in the Conjeeveram taluk. Excellent muslins were formerly made at Ami in the Ponneri taluk, but the industry has died out. Superior sorts of silk and cotton, such as native women wear, are made at Conjeeveram. Coloured check fabrics are manufactured in some villages, especially in the northern part of the Tiruvallur taluk, and are exported to Penang. Similar checks and other stuffs are also made in the Chingleput Reformatory School.\n\nThere are some tanneries, but the industry (which a few years ago was of considerable importance) is languishing on account of the adoption of the chrome process of tanning in America and elsewhere.\nThe skins are now sent to Madras after being merely dried, and are exported thence. The trade is chiefly in the hands of Musalmans.\n\nA cigar factory at Guindy, owned by a European firm, employs 800 hands. Ten small paper-making establishments at Sembiem near Madras provide work for ten or a dozen persons each. The District also contains nearly 400 indigo vats and 500 of the ordinary country oil mills. The Madras Railway has large workshops at Perambur, just outside the limits of Madras City, in which 4,500 persons are employed.\n\nThough the District has a long seaboard, this possesses no single place which can be called a harbour or which offers any facilities for shipping. There are therefore no recognized ports within its limits, and its small sea-borne trade is conducted through the port of Madras. Having no manufactures and no natural products of importance, and being a comparatively infertile area, the District has but little commerce of any kind. Its chief trade consists in supplying the population of Madras City with the ordinary local products, such as dried cow-dung fuel, firewood, grain, vegetables, meat, straw, grass, sand, laterite, bricks, and so forth. In return it imports from Madras the usual foreign goods, such as kerosene oil, European piece-goods, and metals, which are required by the villagers. There can hardly be said to be any real centres of trade. Unimportant weekly markets are held at Uttaramerur in the Madurantakam taluk, at Walajabad in Conjeeveram, and at Vallur in Ponneri. The money-lending of the District is largely in the hands of Marwari, who are prominent in such places as Saidapet, Poonamallee, and Pallavaram. Much of it is also done by a number of mutual benefit and loan societies registered under the Indian Companies Act, the nominal capital of which is as much as Rs. 5,88,000.\n\nSince Chingleput surrounds Madras it is traversed by the three lines, the south-west and north-east sections of the Madras Railway and the South Indian Railway, which start from that city. It is accordingly well provided with railway communication. The south-west line of the Madras Railway (standard gauge) enters the centre of the District at Siruvallur, a few furlongs from the Perambur railway station on the confines of Madras City. It runs due west through the Saidapet and Tiruvallur taluks, and then passes into North Arcot to the junction of Arkonam. This line was opened in 1856. The entire length of 27\u00bd miles within the District has a double line. The East Coast line of the Madras Railway (also on the standard gauge), which is a state railway opened in 1899 and worked since 1901 by the Madras Railway Company, enters the District 2 miles from Tondiarpet, a suburb in the north of Madras City, runs due north as far as Ennore, and thence passes north-westwards through the Ponneri taluk, crossing the Kottalaiyar and Arani rivers by fine bridges, into Nellore District. The length of the line within the District is 28\u00bd miles. The main line of the\nSouth Indian Railway (metre gauge) enters Chingleput from the west of Madras City and runs south through the Saidapet and Chingleput taluks, crosses the Palar river by a girder-bridge of eighteen spans of 120 feet each, and passes through the Madurantakam taluk and on into South Arcot. The portion within the District is 61 miles in length, and was opened in 1876. A branch line connects Chingleput town with Conjeeveram, and runs on towards Arkonam, the total length of this connecting chord within the District being 29 miles. All the three lines run special office trains for the benefit of officials and others who have daily business in Madras City.\n\nThe construction by private enterprise of tramways on five roads in the District, four of which are close to Madras, has recently been sanctioned. These tramways will be on Ewing's mono-rail system, and will be worked by horse and bullock power. One of them, from Poonamallee to the Avadi station on the Madras Railway, has already been opened.\n\nThe District is well provided with roads; all of them are maintained by the local boards. The total length is 717 miles, of which 659 miles are metalled. There are avenues of trees along 594 miles. The chief lines are the southern, western, and northern trunk roads. The first of these leads southwards into South Arcot District, running parallel to the South Indian Railway, through the Saidapet, Chingleput, and Madurantakam taluks. The second runs westward from Madras through the Saidapet and Conjeeveram taluks, and leads to North Arcot District, while the third passes northwards into Nellore District through Saidapet and Ponneri. Owing to the situation of Madras City in the heart of the District, the traffic on all the trunk roads is very heavy.\n\nAlong the whole of the coast of Chingleput runs the Buckingham Canal. It utilizes the backwaters with which the shore is fringed, and places the District in direct communication by water with South Arcot to the south and, on the north, with all the coast Districts as far as Godavari.\n\nChingleput suffered four times from famine in the eighteenth century\u2014in 1733, owing to general neglect of its irrigation works; in 1780, in consequence of Haidar's invasion; in 1785, as the result of a great cyclone which damaged the tanks and channels; and in 1787, from the failure of the rains;\u2014and five times since the beginning of the last century: namely, in 1807, 1824, 1833, 1876-8, and 1891. It has also in several other years (notably in 1867-8, 1868-9, and 1900-1) been affected by less serious scarcities. Its proximity to the seaboard and its numerous railways and the resultant facilities for the supply of grain render improbable the occurrence of any actual dearth of food; but though it is not included within the famine zone of the Presidency, the crops are always more or less\nprecarious. This is more especially the case owing to the facts that a large area of land usually produces rain-fed rice which requires good showers to save it from failure, and that the irrigation works nearly all depend upon local rainfall and dry up if the season is unfavourable. The six largest irrigation works, for example, will in ordinary seasons supply 55,400 acres, but in a bad year they are unable to protect more than 15,000 acres. The minor irrigation works protect about 335,400 acres in ordinary years, but in a year of prolonged drought not more than 41,000. The area protected by wells is also small. The worst famine on record was that of 1876-8\u2014the Great Famine, as it is called. The average number of persons relieved daily in the District during the twenty-two months for which this lasted was 40,000; and in September, 1877, the figure was as high as 116,000, or over 12 per cent. of the total population. Probably, however, a proportion of these were people from other Districts; stories had circulated freely among the natives of the ample supplies of food available in Madras City, and they flocked thither in thousands through Chingleput.\n\nThe taluks are grouped for administrative purposes into three subdivisions, one of which is in charge of a member of the Indian Civil Service, each of the other two being under a Deputy-Collector. The Civilian takes the Chingleput subdivision, comprising the Chingleput, Madurantakam, and Conjeeveram taluks; one of the Deputy-Collectors the Saidapet subdivision, consisting of the Saidapet taluk; and the other the Tiruvallur subdivision, which includes Tiruvallur and Ponneri. A tahsildar is stationed at the head-quarters of each of the taluks and a stationary sub-magistrate also. In addition there are deputy-tahsildars (who are also sub-magistrates) at Poonamallee (Saidapet taluk), Sriperumbudur (Conjeeveram taluk), Uttaramerur (Madurantakam taluk), and Satyavedu (Tiruvallur taluk).\n\nThe superior staff of the District includes the usual officers, except that the Executive Engineer has his head-quarters at Madras City and has also charge of the Buckingham Canal. The Collector's office and residence is at Saidapet, the District Court is at Chingleput (where the District Medical and Sanitary officer also resides), and the Superintendent of police lives at St. Thomas's Mount.\n\nCivil justice is administered by the District Court and four District Munsifs, stationed respectively at Chingleput, Conjeeveram, Poonamallee, and Tiruvallur. A large proportion of the civil litigation is made up of suits under the tenancy law. These are more numerous than in any other District except three, the average annual number being about 1,250. Crime is usually light in Chingleput, the population not including any large number of the criminal castes. Recently dacoities have increased considerably, but this is apparently due to temporary causes.\nVery little reliable information is available regarding the revenue history of the District before it was granted to the East India Company as a jagir. Under the Hindu sovereigns the crown received a share of the produce of each village or township, the government having nothing to do with individual cultivators. Under the Musalmans the government's share of the produce was farmed out to renters to collect, and oppression and confusion were rampant. When the Company obtained the country, they at first rented it back to the Naw\u0101b for a fixed sum. His management was as bad as any administration could be. Absurdly high estimates of the yield of each village were made, and reduced to some extent after fees had been paid to officials and to the Naw\u0101b himself. In 1783 the lease to the Naw\u0101b terminated, and the Company assumed direct management of the Jagir. It was placed under the control of the Committee of Assigned Revenues appointed to manage the Naw\u0101b's possessions in the Carnatic. This committee divided it into fourteen farms, and rented them out on leases for nine years from 1783 to 1791 on progressive rents. But most of the renters failed before the fourth year and hardly any of them were able to tide over the sixth, and thereupon almost all of them were deprived of their farms. After the termination of these leases, the Jagir was parcelled out into smaller allotments and granted on triennial leases to the principal inhabitants. Under this system the revenue improved. In 1794 Mr. Lionel Place, whose name is still remembered in the District, was appointed Collector. He found that the receipts under the triennial leases did not represent the amount properly due to the Company; and he endeavoured to remedy matters by making a careful investigation of the sources of land revenue and a thorough inquiry into the rights and privileges of the ryots, as well as by bringing to light abuses in the collection and management of the assessment. He made a settlement of the land, based on the estimated out-turn of the produce of each village commuted into a money payment, and the principal landowners were held responsible for the collection and payment of the revenue to the Government. This system, however, involved a recognition by Government of inconvenient rights, and was not approved. In 1801-2 a permanent settlement was introduced; the country was divided into sixty-four estates, each paying a revenue of from Rs. 7,000 to Rs. 16,000, the rights to the collections in which, subject to the payment of a fixed revenue to Government, were sold by auction. The fixed revenue was based on an examination of the condition of each village in respect to ploughs, live-stock, means of irrigation, and fertility, checked by reference to the accounts of ten years prior and subsequent to 1780 and the revenue of 1798-9. This system was, however, found to work very unsatisfactorily, as no allowance had been made for bad seasons, and the amounts which the ryots\ncould pay had been estimated on so high a scale that the purchasers of the estates made little profit. In consequence many sales of their land took place, and considerable portions of the estates were resumed and again rented out village by village on triennial leases. In 1803 the ryotwari system was introduced into a portion of the J\u00e4gir. The land was surveyed and classified into 'wet,' 'dry,' and 'garden,' the two former being further subdivided into grades in accordance with their soil. The rates of assessment were arrived at by taking the estimated average out-turn of each field in ten average years, deducting 20 per cent. for cultivation expenses, and then apportioning the residue equally between the Government and the ryot. The Government's share was then converted into a money equivalent. This arrangement was popular with the ryots, and the revenue of the tract where it was introduced rose by nearly one-third. In 1816 the favourable results of the survey and settlement of the Ceded Districts under Sir Thomas Munro induced the Government to order its introduction into the whole of this District, and it has continued in force up to the present day. Between 1870 and 1874 the District was systematically surveyed, and from 1872 to 1879 a resettlement was made. The survey showed that the area in occupation was 11 per cent. more than had been shown in the old accounts, and the settlement resulted in an increase of 4 per cent. in the total assessment. The average assessment on 'dry' land is Rs. 1-8-7 per acre (maximum Rs. 4, minimum 4 annas), and that on 'wet' land Rs. 4-6-8 per acre (maximum Rs. 7-8-0, minimum Rs. 2). The District will very shortly be resettled.\n\nThe revenue from land and the total revenue in recent years are given in the following table, in thousands of rupees:\n\n|                | 1880-1 | 1890-1 | 1900-1 | 1903-4 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Land revenue   | 21,90  | 16,02  | 19,76  | 23,51  |\n| Total revenue  | 26,06  | 22,34  | 27,61  | 32,94  |\n\nOutside the municipalities of Chingleput and Conjeeveram, the local affairs of the District are managed by the three taluk boards of Chingleput, Saidapet, and Tiruvallur, under the immediate supervision of the District board. The areas in charge of the taluk boards correspond with those of the three revenue subdivisions given above. There are eighteen Unions, managed by panchayats established under Act V of 1884, composed of the smaller towns and some of the villages. The expenditure of all these bodies in 1903-4 was Rs. 2,81,000, more than half of which was laid out on public works. The chief source of income was, as usual, the land cess.\n\nThe District Superintendent of police at St. Thomas's Mount has general control over the police throughout the whole District. There\nare 63 police stations (including outposts), and the force numbers 687 constables working under 12 inspectors, besides 1,001 rural police. A force of reserve police at head-quarters numbers 119 men under an inspector.\n\nNo Central jail is maintained in the District, convicts being sent to the Madras Penitentiary or to the jails at Vellore and Cuddalore in North Arcot and South Arcot Districts respectively. There are ten subsidiary jails situated at the head-quarters of the several tahsildars and deputy-tahsildars, with accommodation for 305 prisoners. The Reformatory School for juvenile offenders at Chingleput Town is referred to in the separate article on that place.\n\nAccording to the Census of 1901 Chingleput stands sixth among the Districts of the Presidency in regard to the literacy of its inhabitants, 7-8 per cent. (14-4 males and 1-0 females per cent.) being able to read and write. Education is most backward in the Ponneri taluk and in the Satyavedu side of Tiruvallur. The total number of pupils under instruction in 1880-1 was 14,329; in 1890-1, 24,724; in 1900-1, 34,398; and in 1903-4, 38,364. On March 31, 1904, there were 833 primary, 25 secondary, and 7 special schools, and 2 colleges, besides 422 private schools. Of the 867 institutions classed as public, 9 were managed by the Educational department, 38 by local boards, and 6 by municipalities, while 513 were aided from public funds, and 301 were unaided but conformed to the rules of the department. The majority of the pupils were in primary classes, and the number of girls beyond that stage was small. Of the total male population of school-going age 24 per cent. were in the primary grade of instruction, and of the female population 4-8 per cent. Among Muhammadans the corresponding percentages were 56-8 and 7-6. There were 272 schools for Panchamas, containing 5,911 pupils. The special schools include the Reformatory School at Chingleput and the technical classes in St. Patrick's Orphanage at Adyar. The two colleges are the Teachers' College and the Agricultural College, both at Saidapet. The latter will shortly be removed to Coimbatore. A high school for practising purposes is attached to the former. The total expenditure on education in 1903-4 was Rs. 3,37,000, of which Rs. 73,000 was derived from fees. Of the total, 41 per cent. was devoted to primary education.\n\nThere are fourteen dispensaries in the rural areas of the District, two hospitals in the two municipal towns of Conjeeveram and Chingleput, and a dispensary for women and children at Conjeeveram. The rural dispensaries are maintained by the local boards, which also contribute Rs. 2,500 and Rs. 1,400 respectively towards the upkeep of the municipal medical institutions. In the hospital at Conjeeveram is a maternity ward, which was built by R\u0101j\u0101 Sir R\u0101masw\u0101mi Mudaliy\u0101r. The Chingleput hospital possesses an endowment in Government\nsecurities of Rs. 24,000. In 1903 these institutions treated 182,000 cases, of whom 900 were in-patients. The number of operations performed was 6,000. The expenditure was Rs. 36,000, the greater part of which was met from Local funds.\n\nFor some years vaccination in this District has not been progressing, but during 1903-4 there was some improvement, and the number of persons successfully vaccinated was 42,000, or 32 per 1,000 of the population. Vaccination was made compulsory in 1902 in all villages within a radius of five miles from the head-quarters of each sub-magistrate. It is also compulsory in the two municipal towns of Chingleput and Conjeeveram, and in the cantonments of Pallavaram and St. Thomas's Mount.\n\n[C. S. Crole, Chingleput Manual, 1879.]\n\nChingleput Subdivision.\u2014Subdivision of Chingleput District, Madras, consisting of the Chingleput, Conjeeveram, and Madurantakam taluks.\n\nChingleput Taluk.\u2014Taluk on the shore of the District of the same name, Madras, lying between 12\u00b0 29' and 12\u00b0 54' N. and 79\u00b0 52' and 80\u00b0 15' E., with an area of 436 square miles. The population in 1901 was 155,213, compared with 137,291 in 1891, the rate of increase during the decade, 13 per cent., being much greater than in the District as a whole. It contains two towns and 298 villages. Chingleput (population, 10,551) is the head-quarters, and Tirukkalikkunram (5,728) is a sacred place of pilgrimage. The demand on account of land revenue and cesses amounted in 1903-4 to Rs. 2,82,000. The soil is mostly red ferruginous loam in the interior, and sandy towards the east. Generally speaking, the country is rocky and poor; but much of it is covered with low hills and scrub jungle, and in appearance it is consequently much more diversified and picturesque than the rest of the District. The only river irrigation is that from the Pal\u00e4r, by means of spring channels, which bring the water directly to the fields, and flood channels, which fill the tanks when freshes come down. The greater part of the irrigation is from rain-fed tanks with small catchment basins, and is consequently precarious.\n\nChingleput Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the taluk of the same name in Chingleput District, Madras, situated in 12\u00b0 41' N. and 79\u00b0 58' E., 36 miles south-west of Madras City, and half a mile from the northern bank of the Pal\u00e4r. Population (1901), 10,551. It owes its importance to the fact that it is a junction on the railway and the head-quarters of the District Court, the divisional officer, the District Medical and Sanitary officer, a District Munsif, and a tahsildar, though it merely consists of several small villages which have been clubbed together to form a municipality. The fort dates from the sixteenth century; and it was once, together with Chandragiri in North Arcot, the capital of\nthe fallen Vijayanagar kings after their dynasty had been overthrown by the Musalmans at the battle of Talikot\u0101 in 1565. A local chief subject to these kings granted the Company in 1639 the land on which Fort St. George now stands. Tradition speaks of a certain Timmar\u0101j\u0101, possibly the minister of that name of the Vijayanagar king Krishna Deva, as the founder of the fort. Its strength lay largely in its swampy surroundings and the lake which flanks one side. The Muhammadans eventually seized it, and later on the French acquired possession of it in 1751. Clive bombarded and took the fort from the French in 1752; and throughout the campaign it continued of the first importance to the English, serving now as a place of confinement for the French prisoners, now as a d\u00e9p\u00f4t for war material, and again as a centre for operations against the turbulent chieftains of the neighbourhood. After the reduction of Fort St. David, the Madras Government, apprehensive of an attack on Madras, called in all garrisons and stores from outlying forts; and Chingleput was thus abandoned in 1758. A juster view of its importance soon, however, persuaded the Government to reoccupy it, and while the French were advancing from the south a strong garrison was thrown into it from Madras. Lally, the French general, arrived just too late, and, finding it impregnable except by a regular siege, made the mistake of leaving it in his rear and passing on to Madras. During the siege that followed the garrison of Chingleput rendered invaluable assistance, not only by securing the country north of the P\u0101l\u0101r, but by sallying out with disastrous effect upon the rear of the investing enemy. In 1780 the British troops, after the destruction of Colonel Baillie's force, found refuge here; and during the wars with Haidar Ali of Mysore Chingleput was once taken by the enemy and reoccupied by the British, and twice unsuccessfully besieged. A cave, a mile east of Chingleput, which was originally intended for a Buddhist hermit's cell, has now been made into a Siva temple.\n\nChingleput was constituted a municipality in October, 1896. The receipts and expenditure during the five years ending 1902-3 averaged Rs. 13,000. In 1903-4 they were Rs. 17,500 and Rs. 15,300 respectively. The income is chiefly derived from house and land taxes and from tolls. The health of the town is generally good, and the climate, except during the height of the hot winds, moderately cool. It is almost entirely surrounded by hills, none of them much exceeding 500 feet in height; and these, together with the large tank near the fort already mentioned, and the several lesser sheets of water, make it a very picturesque spot, especially after the rains. The big tank is 2 miles long by 1 mile broad, and has been formed by banking up the drainage of the country for 10 miles to the northward. The supply thus received is far in excess of what is required for the irrigation of the 200 acres which are dependent upon it; and it consequently contains\na supply even in the hot season, when other tanks have long since run dry.\n\nChingleput contains the Reformatory School of the Presidency. This was established in October, 1881, and is intended for the reception of juvenile offenders whom it is undesirable to subject to the risk of contamination by the more hardened criminals of the regular jails. It was for some years under the control of the Inspector-General of Prisons, but in 1888 was transferred to the Director of Public Instruction. Boys are taught useful trades which may enable them to earn an honest livelihood when their term in the school has expired, and endeavours are made to find them employment and keep touch with them after they have left the school. The industries taught include drawing, carpentry and wood-carving, work in iron and other metals, weaving, and tailoring. The school has been a great success.\n\nChin Hills.\u2014A tract of mountainous country inhabited by hill tribes, on the north-west border of Burma, lying between $21^\\circ 45'$ and $24^\\circ N.$ and $93^\\circ 20'$ and $94^\\circ 5' E.$, with an area of about 8,000 square miles. It forms a parallelogram about 150 miles in length, north and south, and varying in breadth from 100 to 150 miles. It is bounded on the north by Manipur; on the west by portions of the Lushai Hills and by the unadministered Chin area that lies to the north and east of the Northern Arakan District; on the south by unadministered country and by the Pakokku Chin Hills; and on the east it borders on the Upper Chindwin and Pakokku Districts. The tract consists from end to end of a mass of mountains, much broken and contorted and intersected by deep valleys, and is practically devoid of plains and table-lands. Its main ranges run generally north and south, and vary in height from 5,000 to 9,000 feet. Among the most important are the Letha or Tang, which is the watershed between the Chindwin and Manipur rivers; the Imbukklang, which sends the water from its eastern slopes into Upper Burma and that from its western slopes into Arakan; and the Rongklang, which, with its prolongations, is the main watershed of the southern tracts, draining on the east into the Chindwin and on the west into the Bay of Bengal. The rivers of the tract flow into Upper Burma, Arakan, Assam, and Manipur. The largest are the Manipur, which starts from Manipur, enters the Chin territory in the north, and after flowing first south and then east leaves Falam on its right bank, and eventually joins the Myittha, one of the tributaries of the Chindwin; the Boinu, which rises in the Yahow country, runs south through the Haka and independent tracts as far as Aika, whence it turns west to Naring, and then flows north into the Lushai Hills, finally to enter Northern Arakan under the name of the Kaladan and fall into the Bay of Bengal; and the Tyao, which flows south to join the Boinu. The\nHri lake, a small mere, about three-quarters of a mile long by one-quarter of a mile broad, is the only important stretch of water in the tract. It is situated near the border, on the Falam-Aijal road, in $23^\\circ 22'$ N.\n\nThe geology of the tract has not yet been worked out in detail, but it has been ascertained that all its rocks belong to the Tertiary period. They are thrown into great folds extending from north to south, and include beds of lower eocene age (Chin shales), Nummulitic limestones, and miocene clays and sandstones. On some of the higher elevations deposits of gravel have been found, and below these a bed of shale of great thickness. In this stratum indications of iron pyrites, sulphur, and ores of a similar nature have been observed in isolated spots, while steatite in fair quantities is found on the lower slopes near the plains. Salt occurs here and there throughout the hills.\n\nReference is made below to the chief timber trees of the Chin Hills. Except in the dense jungles, the hills are thickly clothed with various kinds of grass, of which the coarse bent-grass is the commonest. Spear and elephant grass are found everywhere, whilst sweet meadow-grass grows round some of the villages. More than forty different kinds of trees, including fruit trees such as orange, lemon, citron, mulberry, fig, peach, &c., have been identified, and various flowers and orchids are to be met with. Among other plants, ivy, mistletoe, maidenhair-fern, sweetbrier, and clover (found at Haka) may be mentioned.\n\nThe fauna of the hills is varied, and includes such of the larger beasts as the elephant, the rhinoceros (which is now becoming scarce), the bison, the tsine or hsaing (*Bos sondaicus*), and the mithan (*Gatwaus frontalis*), here believed to be a cross between the wild bison and domestic cattle. All the different species of deer found in Burma are denizens of the Chin jungles; and tigers, leopards, hog, and gibbons abound. A handsome long-haired goat is bred by the Chins, who also keep two breeds of dogs, not only for watch and ward, but for sacrificial purposes.\n\nThe climate, at an altitude of between 3,000 to 6,500 feet, is temperate. In the shade and above ground-level, the thermometer rarely rises above $85^\\circ$ or falls below $25^\\circ$. During the hot season and in the sun very high temperatures have been registered, and on the grass in the cold season ten degrees of frost are not uncommon. In late years the northern tracts, as also some of the higher ranges in the southern tracts, have been visited by severe hailstorms. Rain has been known to fall in every month of the year, but the rainy season proper commences definitely in June and lasts until about the middle of November. The rainfall varies considerably in different parts of the hills; and at Kennedy Peak, Fort White, and Haka, where the jungle is heavy, the amount is greater than at Tiddim, Falam, and elsewhere, where pine-\ntrees are found and the forest is thinner. The average annual rainfall is as follows: Haka and Fort White, 90 to 100 inches; Falam, 50 to 60 inches; Tiddim, 40 to 50 inches. Severe storms before the rains set in are common in the hills, and much damage has at times been caused by them.\n\nThe history of the Chin Hills prior to the annexation of Upper Burma is a record of constant feuds between the different tribes, of expeditions sent by the Chins against the Burmans, the Lushais, and the Manipuris, and of the resistance offered by the people to counter-expeditions from their foreign enemies. Even after annexation the people, accustomed to look askance at their neighbours, could not bring themselves to believe in the good faith of the overtures made by the country's new rulers. During the cold season of 1887-8 negotiations were opened with the Tashons by the Deputy-Commissioner of the Upper Chindwin District. The suspicions of the tribe were, however, aroused, and they were induced by the Shwegyobyu prince and the ex-Sawbwa of Kale to raid in the valley. In May, 1888, they carried off the Kale Sawbwa, and only released him on the condition that he would join in a rising against the British Government. About the same time the Siyins in the north and the Hakas in the south had been giving trouble. Accordingly at the end of 1888 a column marched against the northern tribes, and the people were severely punished, many of their villages being destroyed. In 1889-90 an expedition was dispatched against the Tashons and Hakas, and a post was established at Haka, while in 1891-2 Falam was occupied and garrisoned, and from July, 1892, the Chin Hill Tracts, which had till then been two charges, were amalgamated into a single charge with head-quarters at Falam. In October, 1892, the Siyins and Ngwengal Soktes treacherously ambuscaded a Burman officer of Government, Myo-ok Maung Tun Win, and killed him and several of his escort. The cold season of 1892-3 was in consequence occupied with military operations; a large proportion of their arms were confiscated; the leaders were captured or else surrendered; the principal villages were fined and a house tax was imposed. In 1894-5 the Hakas and southern tribes, and in 1895-6 the Tashons and central tribes, were disarmed. Matters had so far progressed in 1895-6 that it was possible to withdraw the military garrison. In that year the hills were formally declared part of Burma and constituted a scheduled District, their administration being provided for by the Chin Hills Regulation of 1896. In 1897-8 the Pakokku Chin Hill Tract was taken from Pakokku District, and made into a separate Assistant Superintendent's charge. Since 1896 the Chin Hills have, on the whole, been peaceful, though in 1898-9 it was discovered that the Chins had rearmed themselves secretly, and disarmament operations had to be undertaken, during\nwhich the Rumklaos rose and killed three British subjects. The rising did not, however, spread, and was speedily stamped out, and in 1900 the disarmament of the tribes was completed.\n\nThe following are some of the main population statistics obtained at the Census of 1901, the first enumeration that included the Chin Hills in its scope:\n\n| Subdivision | Number of villages | Population | Number of persons able to read and write |\n|-------------|--------------------|------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Falam       | 173                | 36,858     | 551                                    |\n| Tiddim      | 75                 | 16,435     | 247                                    |\n| Haka        | 153                | 33,896     | 237                                    |\n| Total       | 401                | 87,189     | 1,015                                  |\n\nThe principal villages are Falam and Laiyo in the Falam subdivision, Tiddim, Losao, and Tunzan in the Tiddim subdivision, and Haka and Thetta in the Haka subdivision; but the tract contains no towns. Animism is the prevailing religion. At the Census Animists numbered 85,200, or about 98 per cent. of the total population, the representatives of other religions being: Hindus, 1,029; Buddhists, 256; Musalmans, 98; Christians, 33; and others (practically all Sikhs), 542. The American Baptist Mission has established a branch at Haka, and has opened several schools in the hills. There are a few Burmans, Shans, and Nagas, but the great bulk of the population are Chins, who numbered 83,795. The following are the tribes administered from Falam: the Soktes (including the Kanhow clan), Siyins, Tashons, Yahows, Whennohs, Hakas, Klangklangs, and Yokwas, while in the south are independent villages belonging to none of these tribes. The Soktes, Kanhows, and Siyins occupy the northern tract; the Tashons, Yahows, and Whennohs the central tract; and the Hakas, Klangklangs, and Yokwas and independent villages the southern tract. The compilation of tribal totals was not undertaken at the Census, and the precise strength of the different tribes is not known. The Soktes number probably 9,000; the Siyins, who are divided into four clans, between 1,500 and 2,000. The latter bear a very bad reputation, being feared and detested by all the other tribes, who attribute occult powers to them. By the southern Chins they are called Taute. The Tashons are numerically the most important tribe, and their total has been computed at about 39,000. They are known among the northerners as Palamte, after Falam, their capital. The name given to them by the southern tribes is Shunkla. Their authority extended in the past over a number of other tribes, some of which, however, have regained their independence since the British occupation. The Yahows and Whennohs are two of these communities, numbering about 11,500.\nWhennohs are really Lushais by descent. The Hakas, Klangklangs, Yokwas, and dwellers in some of the independent southern villages call themselves Lais. The Hakas, who have been nicknamed Baungshe, from their custom of wearing their top-knot and turban well forward on their heads, number about 14,000, the Klangklangs about 5,000, and the Yokwas between 2,500 and 3,000. The southern independent villages consist of about 50 autonomous hamlets, peopled by Yoyuns, Shintangs, Lawtus, Yos, and Lais. Their inhabitants number 17,000.\n\nThe Chins form a collection of tribes belonging, like the Burmans, the Kachins, the Nagas, and other communities of Further Asia, to the Tibeto-Burman group of the Indo-Chinese race. There is reason to believe that, soon after the prehistoric ancestors of the Burmans had descended from the hills in the east of Tibet towards the head-waters of the Irrawaddy, and before any material change had come over their ancient form of speech, part of the immigration wave that was eventually to flow down into the Irrawaddy valley was deflected to the west, entered the Chindwin region, and eventually spread southwards and westwards over the hills to the Bengal side of the Chindwin, and down into what is now known as the Arakan Yoma. The Kukis or Chins formed a portion of this side-stream. There are three main geographical divisions of the people: the northern Chins, who inhabit the Chin Hills proper as well as a small area to the north; the central Chins, who, under the name of Kamis or Kwemis, Mros, Chinboks, Chinbons, &c., occupy the Northern Arakan District and the Pakokku Chin Hills; and the southern Chins, the inhabitants of the Arakan Yoma. It is with the northern Chins that we are here concerned. They are a sturdy, warlike, hospitable people, slow of speech, grave of habit, paying great regard to rank and to the ties of the clan, but spoilt by their intemperance, their vindictiveness, their treachery, their greed, their lack of persistence, and their personal uncleanliness. They inhabit villages built on the hill-slopes, some of them fortified; and their houses are often solid, elaborate structures. The men's dress consists ordinarily of loin-cloth and blanket, the latter draped toga-like over the upper portion of the body. The women wear skirts, which are shorter in the north than in the south, and in most cases a jacket as well. Home-woven check plaids are notable features in a good many of the costumes. Earrings, necklaces, and bangles are worn by both sexes. Millet, maize, and vegetables are the ordinary food of the people. Rice is appreciated, but is not often procurable in the hills. Though the people are in the main vegetarians, mithan, dogs, goats, and pigs are consumed by them, and there is hardly any animal food that a Chin will decline to touch. Tobacco is smoked in pipes. The liquor of the country is known as ru or su. It is made of fermented grain, and is sucked up through a hollow reed out of the pot in which it has been brewed. Enormous quantities\nof it are consumed at the Chin feasts, which have been described as disgusting orgies. Slavery in a modified form still exists among the Chins, but it is fast vanishing, and would disappear no doubt still faster were the slaves habitually ill-treated. As a matter of fact, the condition of the serfs is one of fairly average comfort, and they have very little to gain by freedom. The people are spirit-worshippers, are exceedingly superstitious, set much store by omens, and have a great belief in the efficacy of sacrifice. Their speech varies so enormously from tract to tract that tribes living barely a day's journey apart are often quite incapable of understanding each other. It has been placed in the Kuki-Chin group of the Tibeto-Burman branch of the Tibeto-Chinese language family. In structure it is not unlike Burmese, but the vocabularies of the two tongues differ very widely.\n\nThe surface soil for the most part, where the slopes permit it to accumulate, is either a rich loam or disintegrated shale, in both of which plants and vegetables suitable to the climate and altitude flourish. In the virgin forests a fairly deep surface coating of the richest decayed vegetable mould is found, and this coating enables rice to be grown on the taungya system in the north, on portions of the eastern slopes, and in certain parts in the south. The rice-fields are prepared by chopping down all the trees and undergrowth on the side of a hill during the cold season. These are allowed to lie, and when the leaves and branches are thoroughly dry and the time for rain approaches, they are burnt. Rice can be raised on a new clearing for two or three years in succession, after which the land is left fallow. Before each crop is sown, the stubble and any timber which could not be consumed during preceding years is burnt. Rice is sown in May and gathered in October. The crop is entirely dependent on the rainfall, and as often as not is damaged by too much rain. All cultivation on the hill-side is done by manual labour, cattle being never used. Most of the fields are partially terraced by trunks of trees and stone supports. The land is never manured, but is enriched by burning the weeds and stalks of the gathered crops on old ground, and by setting fire to the fallen timber on new ground which has been cleared for the first time. The first three months of the year (January, February, and March) are spent in clearing and weeding the soil, building up the terraces, and generally getting the land into order for sowing. At the first rain in March and April the sowing commences. Rice and millet are each sown separately and broadcast, while sometimes cucumbers, pumpkins, and melons are grown in the same field as millet. Maize is planted, one or two grains in each hole, and in the same field beans of all sorts are also grown, and in some cases millet, while sweet potatoes are put down at any time during the rains. As soon as the seed is in the ground the\nfields are carefully guarded against animals and birds, and when the seeds sprout the weeds have to be plucked. The crops are gathered in July and in the three succeeding months. A second crop of millet or black beans is gathered off the same field during the year.\n\nThe population actually engaged in agriculture in 1901 was 20,914 males and 11,304 females, whilst of the entire population 84,601 were primarily dependent on agriculture. The principal crops are: millet (jowar), rice, and maize, gram, varieties of peas and beans, including the aunglaung bean, sweet potatoes, yams, turmeric, ginger, pumpkins, cucumbers, marrows, onions, chillies, brinjals, and wild varieties of spinach. Melons, chillies, plantains, oranges, citrons, peaches, mangoes, papayas, and sweet limes are grown chiefly in the compounds, as also the tobacco plant. Cultivation would appear to have increased of late, but it is impossible to state the precise extent of the expansion. Potatoes have been introduced, and the Chins, though they do not consume them, cultivate them for sale. There is ample grazing for the live-stock.\n\nThe forests of the Chin Hills may be divided into five classes, the lowest being the primateval forest, which flourishes at the foot of the hills, gradually giving way to mixed sub-tropical forest up to an altitude of 3,000 feet. Immediately above this come the pine tracts, which are found at their best at an altitude of about 5,000 feet, here mixed with scrub-oak, which does not usually prosper above 6,000 feet. After this, commencing at an altitude of 4,000 feet, is found the rhododendron. The dwarf bamboo, generally not more than about 6 feet in height, grows on the highest slopes. Below an altitude of 3,500 feet teak attains a large size along the banks of the streams which flow into Burma from the uplands, while in the interior of the hills there are scattered teak trees, though none of any great size. Cutch occurs in fair quantities along the lower slopes adjoining the plains, while in the depth of the hilly country cutch-trees in considerable numbers are met with, at an altitude of about 3,500 feet. The pine is the Pinus Khaya, and is the best resin-producing tree in the world. It is found throughout the hills, the trees varying in size. Portions of three 'reserved' forests extend to the hills in the Kaka subdivision, but their boundaries have not yet been demarcated.\n\nSteatite is found in large quantities in the northern hills; on the eastern slopes near the plains sandstone and slate are common, and limestone occurs in a few isolated places. Salt in minute quantities is found throughout the hills. The best-known spring is the Chibu, on the banks of the Tuivai river in 24\u00b0 N., and a few other brine-wells are scattered about elsewhere. Coal has been discovered to the west of the Kubo valley, but so far only in small quantities and of inferior quality. The steatite quarries were once worked by Burmans, but the cost of extraction was so great that they were abandoned. The Chins\nobtain salt by boiling the water obtained from the salt-springs in clay pots. The result is circular slabs of saline matter, which are very far from pure.\n\nFor export purposes the manufactures are confined to cane and bamboo mats and baskets, while for local use spears, das, hoes, and knives are forged. The iron is procured from Burma, and blacksmiths are found throughout the hills, but Wunhla in the Southern Chin Hills is the only village that has a reputation for ironwork. Hairpins, ear-rings, bangles, armlets, and metal beads are manufactured, as well as domestic implements. Earthen pots are made (by women only) in several villages; waterproof coats and hats are manufactured everywhere, Rawvan in the south being specially noted for this industry. The coats are made out of the bark of a tree, and the hats of bamboo, bark, and palm leaves. Cotton is grown in the hills, and cotton-weaving is universal. The method is laborious on account of the primitive form of loom used, but the cloth turned out, although of a rough texture, is lasting. The work is generally done by the women slaves of the household during their leisure. The weaving of the silk mantles used extensively as a wrap by the southern chiefs is carried out exclusively by their wives or daughters, slaves never taking part in the work, and the garments are seldom if ever sold. The weaving, which is considered an accomplishment, is an extremely slow process, on account of the intricate patterns that are woven into the texture; and it is not unusual for a woman to take two or three years in completing a length of the fabric. Adjoining the southern boundary Burmans rear silkworms, and dispose of the silk to the Chins.\n\nThe export trade is small, consisting for the most part of beeswax, the outside husk of the ear of maize, and cane mats. The principal articles of the import trade, which is increasing yearly, are salt, iron, gongs, brass, cattle, beads, silk thread, and coloured cotton yarn. Most of the imports are obtained from Burma; and the chief centres of Chin trade are Yazagyo, Kalemyo, Indin, and Sihauing in the Upper Chindwin, and Kan and Gangaw in Pakokku District. A trade with Manipur is springing up, while Burmans from as far off as Mandalay are frequently to be found hawking their goods about the hills, and even beyond the western border. The principal trade routes are the Kalewa-Kalemyo-Fort White route, the Indin-Falam route, the Haka-Kan route, and the Manipur-Tiddim route. The Falam-Aijal road, which connects the Chin with the Lushai Hills, is helping to develop a trade with the Lushai country and Assam. The Chins when trading carry their goods themselves, but traders from Burma generally use pack-bullocks.\n\nThe main roads maintained from Provincial funds are the following. The Haka-Pyinthazeik road (with a branch from Tiddim) is an un-\nmetalled road of a total length of 133 miles, of which 124 miles lie in\nthe Chin Hills, and the remainder within the Upper Chindwin District.\nIt crosses the Pao and Manipur rivers by means of wire-rope suspension\nbridges, and gives through communication between all the stations and\nposts in the hills, and also connects the hills with Pyinthazeik on the\nMyittha. There are fourteen resthouses and camps on the road. The\nFalam-Indin road is an unmetalled track of a total length of 47 miles,\nof which 39 miles are within the Chin Hills, and the remainder in\nUpper Chindwin. It connects Falam with the left bank of the Myittha\nriver at a point opposite Indin, and is provided with five resthouses.\nThe Haka-Kan road, an unmetalled mule-road, 55 miles in length, leads\nfrom Haka to the Chin Hills boundary, and on into Pakokku District.\nThe Haka-Kunchaung road, an unmetalled mule-track 44 miles long,\nconnects Haka with Kunchaung, a camp on the Manipur river. The\nFalam-Tyao river mule-road is an unmetalled road intended to connect\nFalam with Aijal, the head-quarters of the Lushai Hills. Its length to\nthe Tyao, the boundary between the Chin and Lushai Hills, is 63 miles.\nIt crosses six rivers, all bridged by timber lattice-girder bridges, and has\nsix resthouses along it.\n\nThe Chin Hills contain three subdivisions, and are administered\nby a Superintendent, who is an officer of the Burma Commission, with\nhead-quarters at Falam, and three Assistants posted\n\nAdministration, at the subdivisional head-quarters\u2014Tiddim, Falam,\nand Haka. The Assistant Superintendents are ordinarily members of\nthe Provincial civil service or the Police department. There is a civil\nMedical officer at Falam. The Chin Hills form a subdivision of the\nChindwin Public Works division, and are in charge of an Assistant\nEngineer with head-quarters at Falam. A treasury officer is stationed\nat Falam. There are no Forest officers.\n\nUnder the Chin Hills Regulation, 1896, the Chin Hills constitute\na Sessions division and a District for criminal, civil, revenue, and\ngeneral purposes, and the Superintendent is the Sessions Judge. As\nSessions Judge he can take cognizance of any offence as a court\nof original jurisdiction, without the accused being committed to him\nby a magistrate. The Penal Code and Criminal Procedure Code with\ncertain modifications are applicable to Chins, and for the purpose of the\nlatter Code the Local Government exercises the power of a High Court.\nSo far as regards persons other than Chins, the law in force is the same\nas that of Upper Burma. Each Assistant Superintendent is invested\nwith magisterial powers. Under the Regulation headmen are held\nresponsible for peace and order within their territories, and are em-\npowered to try certain cases according to local custom. Special rules\nhave been framed by the Local Government for the trial of civil suits\nbetween Chins.\nThe main sources of revenue are tribute and *thathameda*. The former, levied at the rate of Rs. 2 per house, yielded Rs. 41,900 in 1904\u20135; and *thathameda* realized Rs. 1,190. The other items of receipt are insignificant.\n\nA sergeant is stationed at the head-quarters of each subdivision, but beyond these no civil police are maintained in the hills. Falam, the head-quarters of the District, possesses a small lock-up with accommodation for 12 prisoners. The tract is garrisoned by a military police battalion (the Chin Hills battalion), officered by a commandant and 6 assistant commandants, and consisting of 8 companies and 60 gun *kahars*, distributed as follows: 3 companies (with 2 mounted guns) at Falam, 2 companies at Haka, 2 companies at Tiddim, and 1 company at Fort White. These furnish guards at Nos. 2 and 3 Stockades, Kalemyo, Kalewa, Bamboo Camp, Pine-tree Camp, Lomban, Minkin, Pioneer Camp, and Yelakun.\n\nA Government vernacular school has lately been opened at Falam, and the attendance of pupils is good. The American Baptist Mission has established schools at Haka, Tiddim, Koset, Tunzan, and Yokwa. The Haka school has not made much progress as yet, but the others show satisfactory results. For the school at Haka a grant-in-aid of Rs. 2,500 has been given by Government. The expenditure on the school at Falam (opened in 1902) was Rs. 523 in 1904\u20135. No fees are taken at any of the schools. There are no *pongyi kyaungs* in the hills, and consequently, outside the institutions specified, education is at a very low ebb. The Census of 1901 showed that, even including natives of India and Burmans, the proportion of literate males per thousand of the male population was only 2\u00b73 per cent. (as compared with 53 in the adjoining Upper Chindwin District), and that of literate females 0\u00b71 per cent. of the female population. For both sexes together the proportion was 1\u00b72 per cent.\n\nThere are 4 military police hospitals, with a total accommodation for 96 men. Besides 3 civil hospitals, a civil dispensary has been opened on the Falam-Aijal road, and a Hospital Assistant has been placed in charge. The civil hospitals have accommodation for 28 males and 2 females; and in 1903 the number of cases treated was 21,885 (including 557 in-patients), and 122 operations were performed. The total expenditure amounted to Rs. 5,800, of which Rs. 5,300 was provided by Government, and Rs. 300 from subscriptions.\n\nNo vaccination establishment was in existence until the latter part of 1901, when a vaccinator was employed. In 1900\u20131, 582 persons were vaccinated by the officers in charge of the hospitals; in 1901\u20132, 825; in 1902\u20133, 1,809; and in 1903\u20134, 3,617.\n\n[B. S. Carey and H. N. Tuck, *The Chin Hills* (Rangoon, 1896).]\n\nChin Hills, Pakokku.\u2014A tract of hilly country west of Pakokku\nDistrict, Burma, lying between $20^\\circ 40'$ and $21^\\circ 45'$ N. and $93^\\circ 30'$ and $94^\\circ 9'$ E., with an area of about 2,250 square miles, and inhabited by Chins. There is no distinctive native name for the tract. On its east is Pakokku District; on its north-east the Chin Hills; on its south-east and south Minbu District; on the south-west for a length of about 14 miles the tract borders on Akyab; thence westward and north-westward it is bounded by unadministered Chin country, from which, however, it is distinctly marked off by the Arakan Yoma in the south, and by a spur from that range farther north. This spur is the backbone of the Pakokku Chin Hills. It branches off from the Yoma at about $21^\\circ 45'$ N., at a peak called Aisatung, and ends in the south-east corner of the tract.\n\nIt is 2,000 to 3,000 feet higher than the main range, which reaches an elevation of about 5,000 to 7,000 feet along the country now being described. The several offshoots from this spur and the deep valleys between form the hill tract. There is no flat country anywhere. Of the subsidiary spurs the most prominent is that which cuts the tract laterally into two almost equal parts, and rising to 10,400 feet in Mount Victoria, possesses the highest peak in all the Chin country. Lower down on this offshoot, at an elevation of 6,500 feet, is Kanpetlet, the head-quarters of the tract. The chief rivers are the Maw, Yaw, and Mon. The first runs northwards into the Myittha, and belongs to the drainage of the Chindwin, while the others have a generally southerly course and empty themselves into the Irrawaddy. The Mon is the largest; it rises under Aisatung, skirts the northern half, and flows through the southern half of the tract, finally entering Minbu District.\n\nSo far as is known, the geology and botany of the tract differ in no essential particulars from those of the Chin Hills. In addition to the ordinary kinds of wild beasts found in Upper Burma (the tiger, the elephant, &c.), the only noteworthy animals are the goral (*Cemas goral*) and the serow (*Nemorhaedus bubalinus*). Different kinds of monkeys and flying squirrels abound.\n\nTill recently no observations of rainfall have been taken, but it is estimated that about 100 inches of rain fall in the year. At Kanpetlet the average is about 120 inches. From June to November the climate is very humid and depressing, a day of uninterrupted sunshine being rare; and even when it is not raining heavy mists usually envelop the whole country. From the middle of December to the end of March the climate is cold, but dry and altogether enjoyable. The day temperature is then about $75^\\circ$, and the night temperature $35^\\circ$ to $40^\\circ$. Frost is constantly experienced at the higher levels, and in exposed spots the mercury has been found to register $27^\\circ$ at the coldest time of the year. High winds about the end of March and the beginning of April are followed by the early rains, which fall intermittently in April and May.\nIn the days of Burmese rule the hold over the tract was of the lightest. No tribute was paid to the king of Burma, though a few of the villages nearest the plains gave the *myothugyi* they wished to propitiate a viss of beeswax and a cane mat yearly, in order to be allowed to trade. The bearers of these offerings were the only Chins who visited Burma with friendly intentions; but the number of hostile visitors to the plains was large, for raids were frequent, and were usually undertaken in order to obtain captives to be held to ransom. Bloodshed was avoided except when an expedition was made to avenge a Chin who had been killed by Burmans, and the leader of a foray had to give compensation for any loss of life or limb sustained by his followers. In return for this, however, he had the satisfaction of receiving most of the plunder taken and the captives made. The *thugris* of certain Taungtha villages in Burma were recognized as go-betweens in the negotiations for the ransom of captives. The Chins attacked each other only to obtain payment for a debt, but inter-village fighting due to blood-feuds was common. After annexation, raids by the Chins came to the notice of the British as they advanced westward from Pakokku. The tract was visited by a military police column in 1889-90, and it was then decided to place the Chins under the supervision of the officer in charge of a subdivision to be formed along the border. In January, 1891, however, the Chins attacked this officer's head-quarters at Yawdwin. The sequel to this outbreak was the establishment of a military post in the hills at Mindat Sakan in 1891-2. After this the Chins remained fairly quiet till December, 1896, when they perpetrated an exceptionally savage raid, and in the following month attacked the post at Mindat. On this it was decided to constitute the country a Chin tract under the Chin Hills Regulation, and to station a special officer in the hills themselves instead of at their border. An Assistant Superintendent with all the powers of a Superintendent was accordingly posted to the charge of the tract in 1897. Since then there have been no serious raids, and the border may now be said to be entirely free from crime. In 1902 the head-quarters of the Assistant Superintendent were moved from Mindat Sakan to Kanpetlet on the slopes of Mount Victoria. This measure left the Chin police at Mindat unsupported; and the post there was twice raided by Chins from the unadministered tract, in consequence of which a post was established in 1903 at Hilong on the western border and garrisoned by Chin police.\n\nAt the Census of 1901 it was ascertained that the population of the tract was 13,116, distributed in 264 villages. The number of Chins was 12,508, of whom 9,013 were Chinboks, 2,469 Vindus, and 1,026 Chinbons. The Chinboks, with the exception of twelve villages of the tribe (the so-called Chinmes) on\nthe Upper Mon, just beyond the border, are found only in the Pakokku Hill Tracts, while the Yindus and Chinbons overflow into the adjoining country, the first to the west, as far as the Arakan Hill Tracts, the latter to the south-west and the south. In reality they far outnumber the Chinboks. All these tribes belong to the central division of the Chin race (see Chin Hills). It should be borne in mind that this nomenclature has come from the Burmans, and is, including the term Chin itself, entirely unknown in the hills. For convenience of reference, however, it is retained. The Chinboks are found north of Mount Victoria, the Yindus occupy the country to the south and southwest of that eminence, and the Chinbons live south of the Yindus. The Yindus and the Chinboks belong practically to the same tribe. The Chinbons, on the other hand, are a distinct community, and their language is unintelligible to the other Chins. The inhabitants of the tract are practically all Animists. The Chinbok men wear a very scanty loin-cloth, and are seldom seen without their bows and arrows. The women's dress consists of a smock and a short skirt. The females all have their faces tattooed. Both sexes are fond of primitive ornaments. The Chinbons are as a rule somewhat more fully clad than the Chinboks.\n\nThe taungya system of cultivation is practised, and every Chin family in the tract engages in cultivation. The ground for the taungya is selected shortly after the preceding harvest, the clearing of the jungle is completed by February, and the taungyas are burnt in March and April. When the first rains fall about the middle of April festivals to propitiate the nats are held, after which each one is at liberty to sow his plot. The land is not ploughed. Small grain like rice or millet is sown broadcast, after the surface of the ground has been laboriously scratched all over with small hoes. When the seed is large a hole is made in the soil, and the seed is dropped into it and covered over with earth by hand. A taungya is worked for from one to four years, and is then left for six to sixteen years before it is worked again.\n\nThe chief food-grains are pum (a white grain about the size of coarse sago), sat, maize, beans, rice, and barley. Pum is never sown on newly cleared land, and does best on a patch from which rice or sat has been taken. Tobacco is cultivated in all the villages, and a red millet is grown from which the hill folk brew a liquor not unlike cider, and fairly palatable when fresh. Most of the vegetables known in Upper Burma are grown.\n\nUp to about 3,000 feet along the borders of Burma are found bamboo and the timber trees common to similar country in Upper Burma. Above these stretches a belt of indaing, interspersed with weakly pines and oaks. From 4,500 to 8,000 feet the chief trees are Pinus Khasya, oaks, and rhododendrons. Among other trees the yew, wild cherry,\nwalnut, peach, and crab-apple have been noticed in the forests at this elevation. Above 8,500 feet are stretches of gnarled moss-covered oaks in the sheltered spots, and dwarfed rhododendrons and holly in the open grass lands. Dense patches of dwarf bamboos occur at about 8,000 feet. A continuation of the Kyauksit forest Reserve extends some way into the hills, but otherwise there is no 'reserved' area in the tract.\n\nPractically nothing is known at present of the mineral resources of the tract. Steatite is found near the Pakokku border, but nothing else of economic value has been discovered.\n\nThe hills have nothing to show in the way of arts or manufactures. The only hand industries are rude weaving, pottery, and the making of cane mats, while a few blacksmiths fashion primitive spear and arrow-heads from iron obtained from the plains.\n\nPetty internal trade is carried on by barter, while for large transactions the currency used is ear-rings. These are shaped like flat key-rings, and are made of an alloy of gold, silver, and brass. They are said to have been originally obtained from Arakan, but they do not seem to be imported now. The Chins carry on a small trade with Burma, the exports consisting of beeswax, honey, and mats, and the imports of salt, cotton twist, beads, and gongs.\n\nThe villages of the tract are connected by rough jungle paths, but these are so bad that only a resident of the hills would voluntarily travel by them, and they are entirely impracticable for beasts of burden. The following mule-tracks have, however, been made by the Public Works department: from Saw to Kanpetlet, 12 miles, and thence 7 miles farther up the Mount Victoria range to Kyetchedaung; from Mindat to Hilong, 14 miles, and on to the trans-border village of Khrum; from Kanpetlet to Mindat, 32 miles. Several routes lead from the Irrawaddy; the first from Pakokku via Pauk is nine to eleven marches, the second from Zigat, opposite the steamer gh\u00e2t of Sale, is six. A third from Sinbyugyun is also six marches. Furnished rest-houses have been provided on both routes, and also on the two mule-tracks above mentioned.\n\nThe tract is under the immediate control of the Commissioner of the Minbu Division, to whom the Assistant Superintendent is directly subordinate. The head-quarters of the Assistant Superintendent are at Kanpetlet, on the high ground of which Mount Victoria forms the highest point. The 264 villages in the tract are divided into ten groups, each of which is supervised by a paid headman, and a headman is in charge of each village. The tract forms part of the Yaw Forest division, and is a subdivision of the Pakokku Public Works division.\nThe only court is that of the Assistant Superintendent, who tries criminal cases and decides civil suits, besides sitting as the court of a Superintendent or a District Magistrate, and, when necessary, as that of a Sessions Judge, under the control of the Local Government (represented by the Commissioner of Minbu) as High Court. Crime is on the whole light; but, as might be expected of a people as barbarous and vindictive as the Chins, offences against the person are committed at times.\n\nTribute at the rate of R. 1 a house is collected yearly, and a small amount of revenue is derived from the sale of the right to quarry soapstone and from licences to boil cutch. The total revenue from all sources in 1904-5 amounted to over Rs. 2,800. Nothing in the shape of land revenue is collected. All land, cultivable or uncultivable, is claimed by some individual or family, who trace its ownership back for generations. Land can be bought outright, an ear-ring worth about Rs. 15 being sufficient to purchase an area that can be worked by three families; but there is not much traffic in immovable property.\n\nThe military police garrison, which is furnished by the Magwe battalion, consists of a detachment of 40 men stationed at Kanpetlet. The actual policing of the tract is in the hands of a force of Chin armed police, composed of 2 head constables, 3 sergeants, and 71 constables, who, in addition to their other duties, furnish a detachment of 30 men stationed at Hilong to watch the border. A hospital is maintained at Kanpetlet, but is very little patronized by the Chins.\n\nChini.\u2014Head-quarters of Kanawar (Chini tahsil), Bashahr State, Punjab, situated in 31\u00b0 31' N. and 78\u00b0 19' E., about a mile from the right bank of the Sutlej, in a slight depression on the southern slope of a lofty mountain, at an elevation of 1,500 feet above the river and 9,685 above sea-level. It is naturally irrigated by a large number of little rills, and surrounded with vineyards, whose grapes, dried into raisins, form a principal article of food for the people. Large dogs, specially trained for the purpose, deter the bears from plundering the vines. Chini was the favourite hill residence of Lord Dalhousie. The Moravian Mission has a station here, and the place contains a handsome tahsil building.\n\nChiniot Tahsil.\u2014Tahsil of Jhang District, Punjab, lying between 31\u00b0 23' and 32\u00b0 4' N. and 72\u00b0 24' and 73\u00b0 14' E., with an area of 1,012 square miles. It includes the villages on both banks of the Chenab. The population in 1901 was 200,676. It contains the town of Chiniot (population, 15,685), the head-quarters; and 361 villages. The land revenue and cesses amounted in 1905-6 to 2.64 lakhs. A portion of the tahsil was incorporated in the new District of Lyallpur, formed in 1904. Ten years before this, the tahsil consisted of a few villages along the Chenab, with the steppes of the Kirana and\nSandal B\u0101rs to the north and south. The waste has now been brought under cultivation, owing to irrigation from the Jhelum and Chen\u0101b Canals. There is little to break the monotony of the plains on either side of the river, except the knolls of the quartzite outcrop near Chiniot town, and the Kir\u0101na hills, of similar composition, close to the Sh\u0101hpur border.\n\nChiniot Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the tahsil of the same name in Jhang District, Punjab, situated in $31^\\circ 43' N.$ and $73^\\circ 0' E.$, 52 miles north-east of Jhang town. Population (1901), 15,685. The town is a very old one, and is perhaps to be identified with S\u0101kala, the capital of the White Huns, which was visited by Hiuen Tsiang. It suffered much from the Durr\u0101ni inroads during the last half of the eighteenth century, and also during the troubles of 1848, being the scene of constant sanguinary struggles between the leaders of local factions. It now bears a prosperous aspect, most of the houses being of excellent brickwork, lofty and commodious, especially those of the Khoja traders, who have large business dealings with Amritsar, Calcutta, Bombay, and Kar\u0101chi. It boasts a handsome mosque built by Naw\u0101b Sadullah Kh\u0101n Tah\u012bn, governor of the town under Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n; also a shrine dedicated to Sh\u0101h Burh\u0101n, a Muhammedan saint, revered by Hindus and Muhammedans alike. The surrounding country is well wooded, and its scenery attractive. The town is famous for brass-work and wood-carving; its masons are said to have been employed on the T\u0101j Mahal at Agra, and the architect of the Golden Temple at Amritsar was a Chiniot mason. It has benefited by the Chen\u0101b Canal, and conducts a large trade in wheat, cotton, and other agricultural produce. The municipality was created in 1867. The income during the ten years ending 1902\u20133 averaged Rs. 17,800, and the expenditure Rs. 16,300. The income in 1903\u20134 was Rs. 18,500, derived mainly from octroi; and the expenditure was Rs. 20,100. It maintains a dispensary and an Anglo-veracular middle school.\n\nChinn\u016br Taluk.\u2014Taluk in Adil\u0101b\u0101d District, Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State, with an area of 790 square miles, including a large forest tract. It is separated from the Central Provinces District of Ch\u0101nda on the east by the Pranhit\u0101 river. The population in 1901, including j\u0101girs, was 56,591, compared with 52,889 in 1891. The taluk contains one town, Chinn\u016br (population, 6,561), the head-quarters; and 110 villages, of which 11 are j\u0101gir. The land revenue in 1901 amounted to Rs. 64,000. The river God\u0101vari forms its southern and the Pranhit\u0101 its eastern boundary, the soils in the vicinity of these rivers being alluvial. Rice is largely raised with the help of tank-irrigation.\n\nChinn\u016br Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the taluk of the same name in Adil\u0101b\u0101d District, Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State, situated in $18^\\circ 51' N.$ and $79^\\circ 48' E.$, 10 miles north of the God\u0101vari river. Population (1901), 6,561\nChinnur contains the taluk and police inspector's offices, a post office, and a dispensary. Strong and very durable cloth is made here from tasar silk.\n\nChinsura.\u2014Town in Hooghly District, Bengal, situated in $22^\\circ 53' N.$ and $88^\\circ 24' E.$, on the right bank of the Hooghly river, a short distance to the south of Hooghly town. Chinsura is now included in the Hooghly municipality (see Hooghly Town), and the two towns contained in 1901 a joint population of 29,383. The Dutch established themselves at Chinsura in the early part of the seventeenth century and held the place till 1825, when it was ceded by the Netherlands to Great Britain in part exchange for the English possessions in Sumatra. It was formerly used as a military invalid d\u00e9p\u00f4t, and for regiments arriving from or proceeding to England; but in 1871 the military station was abandoned and the barracks were leased to the residents and utilized for schools, a post office, and other public purposes. Chinsura contains the courts, the Imamb\u00e2ra Hospital with 40 beds, and a female hospital with 13 beds. The church and a large house on the river banks at a short distance to the north of it were built by the Dutch, the latter being the official residence of the Governor. The Armenian Church erected in 1695 is a building of considerable antiquarian interest. Chinsura was the head-quarters of the Burdwan Division from 1879 to 1884; they were then removed to Burdw\u00e2n, but were again transferred to Chinsura in 1896. The Hooghly College is finely situated on the bank of the river near the church; it was founded and endowed in 1836 from a portion of the trust fund of the Saiyidpur estate in Jessore District. There are 150 students in the college, which teaches up to the B.A., and in some subjects to the M.A., standard of the Calcutta University; and 200 boys in a school attached to the college. This school, the Chinsura Free Church Mission school, and the Chinsura Training Academy are all higher English schools. A public library was established in 1854 and is partly endowed.\n\nChint\u00e2mani.\u2014Central taluk of Kol\u00e2r District, Mysore, lying between $13^\\circ 18'$ and $13^\\circ 40'$ N. and $77^\\circ 57'$ and $78^\\circ 13'$ E., with an area of 272 square miles. The population in 1901 was 57,144, compared with 49,888 in 1891. The taluk contains one town, Chint\u00e2mani (population, 2,430), the head-quarters; and 341 villages. The land revenue demand in 1903-4 was Rs. 1,22,000. The northern half is a stony tract, but with good tanks and wells. The southern half is an open rolling country of red soil. Sugar-cane thrives well, and the r\u00e2gi grown here is superior. Blankets and coarse cloth are made in some parts, and a finer cloth for kumarbands. Gunny for sacking is woven at Dimbala and Ron\u00fbr.\n\nChintpurn\u00ee.\u2014Mountain range in Hoshi\u00e2rpur District, Punjab. See Sola Singh\u00ee.\nChipl\u00fcn Taluka.\u2014Central taluka of Ratnagiri District, Bombay, lying between $17^\\circ 12'$ and $17^\\circ 37'$ N. and $73^\\circ 8'$ and $73^\\circ 45'$ E., with an area of 671 square miles, including the petty subdivision (petha) of Guhagar. It contains one town, Chipl\u00fcn (population, 7,886), the head-quarters; and 208 villages. The population in 1901 was 190,746, compared with 185,341 in 1891. The density, 284 persons to the square mile, is slightly below the District average. The demand for land revenue in 1903-4 was 1.46 lakhs, and for cesses Rs. 10,000.\n\nThe taluka stretches from the coast inland to the watershed of the Western Ghats, and is throughout more or less hilly and rugged. The seaboard, with the exception of an open sandy roadstead 5 miles long, extending on each side of the village of Guhagar, is broken and irregular. Close to the shore rise a series of high laterite plateaux, which stretch 10 miles inland, where they are succeeded by a belt of lower undulating land; but on meeting the spurs and ravines thrown out by the great mountain chain of the Western Ghats the country becomes very rugged and precipitous. The only rivers of importance are the Vashishti in the north and the Shastri in the south, both of which are tidal for a distance of about 25 miles from their mouths, and are navigable within these limits by boats of moderate size. The annual rainfall averages 141 inches.\n\nChipl\u00fcn Town (originally Chitapolan).\u2014Head-quarters of the taluka of the same name in Ratnagiri District, Bombay, situated in $17^\\circ 32'$ N. and $73^\\circ 31'$ E., 108 miles south-east of Bombay and about 25 miles from the coast, on the south bank of the river Vashishti, which is navigable by boats of nearly 2 tons. Population (1901), 7,886. Chipl\u00fcn is a prosperous commercial town, near the head of the Kumbh\u00e4rli pass, one of the easiest routes from the Deccan to the seaboard. It contains good roads; an efficient conservancy establishment is maintained, and the streets are lighted. A reservoir formed by a masonry dam thrown across the bed of a small river 3 miles south of the town, provides an ample water-supply. The municipality dates from 1876, and had an average income during the decade ending 1901 of Rs. 13,400. In 1903-4 the income was Rs. 12,500. About a quarter of a mile south of the town are some Buddhist excavations and a fort with a reservoir on a detached hill commanding the creek. Chipl\u00fcn is the home of the Konkanasths or Chipavan Brahmins, the name Chipavan being explained as a corruption of the old name, Chitapolan. The town contains a Subordinate Judge's court, a dispensary, and five schools, including two Anglo-veracular schools and a girls' school, attended by 328 boys and 31 girls.\n\nChipurupalle.\u2014Northernmost coast taluk of Vizagapatam District, Madras, lying between $18^\\circ 2'$ and $18^\\circ 32'$ N. and $83^\\circ 26'$ and $83^\\circ 57'$ E., with an area of 549 square miles. The population in 1901 was 170,532,\ncompared with 156,570 in 1891. The taluk contains 268 villages, the head-quarters being at Chipurupalle. The demand for land revenue and cesses in 1903-4 was Rs. 49,000. The taluk is flat, and a large part of it is covered with low scrub jungle.\n\nChirakkal.\u2014Northernmost taluk of Malabar District, Madras, lying between 11\u00b0 47' and 12\u00b0 18' N. and 75\u00b0 11' and 75\u00b0 41' E., with an area of 677 square miles. It contains 43 amsams, or parishes. The population increased from 310,941 in 1891 to 320,107 in 1901. The demand for land revenue amounted in 1903-4 to Rs. 3,39,000. It contains the seaport of Cannanore (population, 27,811), which is also the headquarters, and the towns of Taliparamba and Valarpattanam. In the north-eastern corner of the taluk two hill tribes are found, the Vettuvans and the Mavilars, who supply the agricultural labour of the country and are practically agristic slaves. The females of these tribes wear nothing but green leaves, which are changed daily at noon. An attempt at reform in the matter of dress was once made, but to no purpose, as the individuals who tried the experiment of wearing clothes all came to untimely ends. The north-east and east of the taluk are bounded by the great range of the Gh\u00e2ts and the western side by the Indian Ocean. Along the coast the beach is generally low and sandy, but immediately behind it rises the high lateritic formation which is characteristic of this part of Malabar; and the contrast between the red soil which this forms and the many groves and fields which lie in the hollows among it is exceedingly picturesque.\n\nChirala.\u2014Town in the Bapatla taluk of Gunt\u00fbr District, Madras, situated in 15\u00b0 50' N. and 81\u00b0 21' E., 8 miles along the sand ridge from Bapatla town. Population (1901), 16,264. It has been constituted a Union, and a prosperous weaving industry is carried on.\n\nChirawa.\u2014Town belonging to the Khetri chiefship in the Shekhawati nizamat of the State of Jaipur, Rajputana, situated in 28\u00b0 14' N. and 75\u00b0 41' E., about 100 miles north of Jaipur city. Population (1901), 7,065. There is a picturesque little fort, but it is in a dilapidated condition. Some wealthy bankers reside in the town, who have built dharmas\u00e3las or inns for travellers; two of them maintain a vernacular school each, at which 158 boys attended in 1904-5. There are also 4 indigenous schools attended by 200 boys. Chirawa possesses a combined post and telegraph office, and the Raja of Khetri keeps up a hospital which has accommodation for 4 in-patients.\n\nChirkharee.\u2014Name of a State and town in Central India. See Charkhari.\n\nChiroda.\u2014Petty State in Kathiawar, Bombay.\n\nChitakul.\u2014Village in the Karwar taluka of North Kanara District, Bombay, situated in 14\u00b0 51' N. and 74\u00b0 10' E., on the coast, about 4 miles north of Karwar. Population (1901), 4,796. Though it is\nnow confined to the village, the name Chit\u0101kul once included a considerable tract of land. Under the forms Sindabur, Chintabor, Cintabor, Cintapor, Cintacola, Cintacora, Chittikula, and Chitekula, the place appears in the writings of many authors, from the Arab traveller Masaudi (about 900) to the English geographer Ogilby (about 1660). It is frequently referred to in the accounts of the vicissitudes of Portuguese power in India. In 1715, according to a local account, Basva Ling, a Sonda chief (1697\u20131745), built a fort at Chit\u0101kul, on the north or right bank of the K\u0101linadi, and called it Sad\u0101shivgarh after his father. From this time the village has locally been called Sad\u0101shivgarh. The fort is built on a flat-topped hill 220 feet high, with a steep and inaccessible face on the side facing the K\u0101linadi. In 1752 the Portuguese declared war against the Sonda chief, and after a slight conflict carried the fort, which they greatly strengthened. Two years later they restored the fort to the Sonda chief. In 1763 it was taken by Haidar Ali\u2019s general, Fazl-ullah Kh\u0101n. In 1783 a detachment of General Mathew\u2019s force was sent to occupy Sad\u0101shivgarh. In 1799 it was garrisoned by Tip\u016b\u2019s troops.\n\nChitaldroog District (properly Chitrakaldurga).\u2014District in the north of Mysore State, lying between 13\u00b0 35' and 15\u00b0 2' N. and 75\u00b0 38' and 77\u00b0 3' E., with an area of 4,022 square miles. It is bounded on the north by the Bellary District of Madras; on the east by Anantapur District; on the south-east by Tumkur; on the south-west by Kad\u016br; and on the west by Shimoga and the Dharw\u0101r District of Bombay.\n\nThe whole of the District is included in the valley of the Ved\u0101vati or Hagari, with the Tungabhadra running for a few miles along the north-western boundary. The Ved\u0101vati enters the District in the south-west and flows in a north-easterly direction beyond Hiriy\u016br. From this point, where the stream begins to take the name of Hagari, it runs north, within a few miles of the main eastern boundary, and near the eastern base of the Molak\u0101lmuru projection crosses into Bellary District. During the hot months it is for the most part dry, but supplies a number of wells sunk in its sandy bed. The Tungabhadra receives at Har\u012bhar the Haridra, which flows out of the Sulekere lake. The District is crossed by a belt, about 20 miles broad, of intermittent parallel chains of hills, mostly bare and stony, through which are several kanaves or passes. The eastern line runs from the frontier beyond Kankuppa to Chitaldroog and Jogimaradi (3,803 feet) to the west of Hiriy\u016br. The western line runs from Anaji by M\u0101yakonda to Hosdurga (3,226 feet). Around Mulak\u0101lmuru in the north are some clusters of rocky hills, of which Nunke Bhairava is 3,022 feet high, Jatinga R\u0101mesvara 3,469 feet, and Santigudda 2,595 feet. Except in the region of the hilly belt, the whole extent of the District north and east is an open and\nlevel plain, entirely destitute of picturesque features, but possessing at certain seasons in favourable spots an expanse of verdant cultivation. Though there are no trees, excellent pasture is abundant, while the black and dreary-looking soil seems to require only the contact of water to develop its productiveness. To provide irrigation, the M\u0101ri Kanave dam is being built on the Ved\u0101vati, which will form a reservoir with an area of 34 square miles. To the north and west of Chitadroog the surface of the country is undulating, and covered with thick and rich grass. Trees are few in number.\n\nThe ranges of hills running through the middle of the District form part of the Chikn\u0101yakanhalli schist band, which is a continuation of the Dambal band in Bellary District. The great granite massif of Chitadroog divides it into two horns, and thence it runs south-south-west into Tumkur District. The beds all strike parallel to the schist band, and for the most part dip steeply to the east. Talya is on the western gneiss, upon which rests a series of quartzites and some schistose hornblendic rocks. Above these are conglomerates, the pebbles of which are quartz or quartzite, much flattened, and the matrix is gritty, with much biotite or hornblendic material. East of this are ridges of hematite quartzite with some limestone beds, bordering a valley occupied by soft argillaceous schists. The wide stretch of flat country between the conglomerates and the eastern gneiss is occupied by felspathic, chloritic, and micaceous schists, with some pale hornblendic members. In this northern portion of the band extensive basic trap flows are noticed, the largest being that on the south-eastern side of the Chitadroog granite which forms the Jogimaradi hill. The horseshoe of hematite-quartzite beds running round the same granite mass is also noteworthy.\n\nChitadroog is the driest part of Mysore. The flora is practically the same as in Tumkur District, though not so luxuriant. Great undulating plains, covered frequently with nothing but stones and dwarf species of mimosa, are dotted at wide intervals with villages lying in the hollows, sometimes having a few trees round them. These are the characteristics of fully one-third of the District. The valley of the Ved\u0101vati looking towards Hosdurga is not so bare, and in the north are jungles of karachi (Hardwickia binata).\n\nThe annual rainfall at Chitadroog averages 25 inches, the highest monthly average being 4 inches in both September and October. The mean temperature is $74^\\circ$ in January and $83^\\circ$ in May, with a diurnal range in both of $23^\\circ$. In July the mean is $75^\\circ$ and the diurnal range $14^\\circ$; in November the mean is $74^\\circ$ and the diurnal range $18^\\circ$.\n\nThe discovery of edicts of Asoka in the Molakalmuru taluk afford evidence that the north of the District was included in the Maurya empire in the third century B.C. The find of Satakarni coins near\nChitaldroog, and of \u015a\u0101takarni inscriptions in the Shik\u0101rpur taluk (Shimoga District), show that the Andhras or \u015a\u0101tav\u0101hanas were in power here about the second century A.D. They were followed by the Kadambas, who became subject to the Ch\u0101lukyas in the sixth century. Under the Gangas, R\u0101shtrak\u016btas, and Ch\u0101lukyas, in succession, we find the Pallavas called Nonambas or Nolambas\u00b9, from whom the District, with neighbouring parts to the north and east, obtained the name of Nolambav\u0101\u1e0di or Nonambav\u0101\u1e0di, a 'thirty-two thousand' province\u00b2. Their capital was at Penjeru or Henjeru, now Hemavati, in Anantapur District, close to the eastern border of the Hiriyur taluk, but at one time was at Kampili on the Tungabhadra, north of Bellary. In the eleventh and twelfth centuries the P\u0101ndyas of Uchchangi were ruling Nolambav\u0101\u1e0di. The Hoysalas then came into possession; but towards the end of the thirteenth century the Seunas, or Y\u0101davas of Deogiri, gained some advantage over the Hoysalas, and established themselves for a short period in parts of the north-west, with their seat of government at Belt\u016br or Bett\u016br, near D\u0101vangere. On the Hoysalas recovering power they made Bemmattanakallu, the present Chitaldroog, the seat of government for the province. In the fourteenth century both Seunas and Hoysalas fell victims to the Musalm\u0101n invasions from Delhi. But the Vijayanagar empire now arose, and the Chitaldroog state was founded, in subordination to it, in the fifteenth century. This continued an important power till, after more than one effort, it was finally subjugated in 1779 by Haidar Ali, who deported 20,000 of the Beda population to people the island of Seringapatam. There was also a state with head-quarters at Hatti (now N\u0101yakanhatti\u00b3), which acquired Molak\u0101lmuru from R\u0101yadurga. But this was absorbed into the Chitaldroog territory. The other principal state was that of the Harati family round Dodderi in the east of the District. They were driven from there by the Bij\u0101pur invasions of the seventeenth century, and established themselves at Nidugal, till subdued by Tip\u016b Sult\u0101n in 1784. The District suffered severely from the Mar\u0101\u1e6dha inroads of the eighteenth century, by which it was deprived of the great majority of its inhabitants, and entirely denuded of woods. The west and south again underwent much trouble in the rebellion of 1830.\n\nThe primitive stone structures known as kistvaens are called in the Molak\u0101lmuru taluk, where the Asoka edicts were found, moryara mane, 'houses of the Moryas' or Mauryas\u2074. There are also groups of stone\n\n\u00b9 The existing caste of Nonabas represents its former subjects.\n\u00b2 These numerical designations, almost invariably attached to the names of ancient divisions in Mysore, apparently refer to their revenue capacity or to the number of their siddas.\n\u00b3 It appears they are also so called by the Badagas of the Nilgiris, who are Kanarese immigrants from the north (badaga).\ncircles called *morya dinne*, 'mounds of the Moryas,' which seem to be the sites of Beda encampments. At the Ankli *math*, west of Chitaldroog, is a remarkable series of subterranean chambers, containing shrines, *lingams*, baths, and pedestals, the latter apparently for *yog\u0101sana*. They are unused, and nothing is known of their history. An inscription at a cave close by is of the thirteenth century. At Anekonda near D\u0101vangere, and along the Tungabhadra, at Nandigudi, V\u0101sana, and Nandit\u0101vare, are striking remains of temples, the latter of the Hoysala period. But the chief architectural monument is the Hariharesvara temple at Harihar. It is of the Ch\u0101lukyan style, and was built in 1224 under the Hoysalas. Though shorn of many of its ornamental features, it was fortunately spared by the Muhammadan invaders of the seventeenth century, who contented themselves with using the roof as a mosque, making a small Saracenic doorway into the dome over the image of the god to serve as the *minbar* or pulpit. The inscriptions of the District have been translated and published.\n\nThe population at each Census in the last thirty years was: (1871) 435,553; (1881) 316,511; (1891) 413,984; and (1901) 498,795. The decrease in 1881 was due to the famine of 1876-8.\n\n**Population.** By religion, in 1901 there were 464,092 Hindus, 23,950 Musalmans, 443 Christians, 801 Jains, and 9,506 Animists. The density was 124 persons per square mile, that for the State being 185. The number of towns is 14, and of villages 1,484. The largest town is D\u0101vangere (population, 16,402), while Chitaldroog, the head-quarters, has only 5,792 inhabitants.\n\nThe following table gives the principal statistics of population in 1901:\n\n| Taluk     | Area in square miles | Number of Towns | Villages | Population | Population per square mile | Percentage of increase in population between 1891 and 1901 | Number of persons able to read and write |\n|-----------|----------------------|-----------------|----------|------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Chitaldroog | 531                  | 2               | 187      | 83,305     | 157                         | + 25.0                                                   | 4,904                                  |\n| D\u0101vangere  | 556                  | 3               | 239      | 109,121    | 196                         | + 15.4                                                   | 5,521                                  |\n| Jagal\u016br    | 372                  | 1               | 168      | 47,196     | 127                         | + 23.5                                                   | 1,797                                  |\n| Molak\u0101lmuru| 290                  | 3               | 94       | 37,744     | 130                         | + 15.9                                                   | 1,603                                  |\n| Challakere | 788                  | 1               | 192      | 74,035     | 94                          | + 21.9                                                   | 2,881                                  |\n| Hiriy\u016br    | 635                  | 1               | 152      | 48,404     | 76                          | + 22.1                                                   | 2,694                                  |\n| Hosdurga   | 567                  | 1               | 252      | 45,932     | 79                          | + 21.1                                                   | 3,505                                  |\n| Holalkere  | 405                  | 1               | 180      | 44,848     | 110                         |                                                          |                                        |\n\nDistrict total | 4,144                | 14              | 1,484    | 480,645    | 118                         | + 20.5                                                   | 22,904                                 |\n\n**Note.\u2014** Hosdurga, a sub-*taluk* of Holalkere in 1901, was reconstituted a separate *taluk* in 1902-3, and the areas and population of the last three are figures subsequent to the change. At the same time, 97 square miles from the Chikn\u0101yakanhalli *taluk* of Tumkur District, and 25 square miles from the Kad\u016br *taluk* of Kad\u016br District, were transferred to the Hosdurga *taluk*.\nThe most numerous castes are Ling\u0101yats, 96,000, and Bedas, 85,000. There are 54,000 Wokkaligas or cultivators; 47,000 M\u0101digas and 9,000 Holeyas, both outcaste tribes; 37,000 Gollas or cow-keepers; and 30,000 Kurubas or shepherds. Of Br\u0101hmans there are 7,000. Of Musalm\u0101ns two-thirds are Shaikhs, 16,000. The nomad Lamb\u0101nis number 7,000, and Korachas 2,000. By occupation 60 per cent. of the population are dependent on agriculture and pasture; 19 per cent. on the preparation and supply of material substances; and 8-9 per cent. on unskilled labour not agricultural.\n\nChristians number only 443, the smallest number in any District in Mysore; and of these, 386 are natives. There is no mission station, but Wesleyan missionaries from Shimoga visit D\u0101vangere and other places.\n\nBlack cotton soil prevails throughout the t\u0101lukas north and west of Chitaldroog town, interspersed with sandy and gravelly tracts. In the west a red and loamy soil occupies the valleys. In the south the soil contains much salt, and on that account is favourable to the growth of coco-nut palms, of which there are large plantations. The t\u0101lukas in the east have a light sandy soil abounding in springs. These talpargis or spring-heads may be tapped at short distances from each other. The water is either conducted by narrow channels to the fields, or a well is constructed, from which the water is raised by two or four bullocks. Except in the Chitaldroog t\u0101luk, these wells are for the most part found east of a nearly central line drawn from north to south.\n\nThe following table gives the chief statistics of cultivation in 1903-4:\n\n| Taluk     | Total | Cultivated | Irrigated | Forests | Cultivable waste |\n|-----------|-------|------------|-----------|---------|------------------|\n| Chitaldroog | 518   | 234        | 14        | 50      | 48                |\n| D\u0101vangere  | 547   | 417        | 8         | 17      | 28                |\n| Jagal\u016br    | 369   | 178        | 5         | 45      | 30                |\n| Molak\u0101lmuru| 280   | 92         | 15        | 45      | 24                |\n| Challakere | 783   | 310        | 24        | ...     | 184               |\n| Hiriy\u016br    | 647   | 229        | 13        | 84      | 67                |\n| Hodurga    | 555   | 139        | 13        | 43      | 74                |\n| Holalkere  | 404   | 137        | 7         | 42      | 45                |\n| **Total**  | **4,083** | **1,636**  | **99**    | **346** | **500**           |\n\nChitaldroog, Hiriy\u016br, M\u0101yakonda, D\u0101vangere, and Bilchod produce cotton, which is also grown, though in smaller quantities, in Anaji, Kankuppa, and Molak\u0101lmuru. Flax for the manufacture of linseed-oil is raised in D\u0101vangere, Kankuppa, and Bilchod. All the northern t\u0101lukas produce wheat, jola, navane, sugar-cane, and chenna. Rice is less\nabundant. Cumin seed is grown in the north-east. In the south, about Mattod, are extensive groves of coco-nut palms, growing in the 'dry' lands without irrigation. The cultivation in the south-west consists of the ordinary 'dry crops' raised on red soil. All along the east, wells are largely used in raising crops by irrigation, including r\u0101gi, which on the Bellary border is cultivated in no other way. The area occupied by the various crops in 1903-4 was: r\u0101gi, 261 square miles; rice, 63; other food-grains, 866; gram, 223; oilseeds, 141; cotton, 89; garden produce, 15; sugar-cane, 5.\n\nDuring the twelve years ending 1904 there was advanced a sum of 1.8 lakhs for irrigation wells and Rs. 40,000 for field embankments. For land improvements the advances amounted to Rs. 33,000.\n\nThere were 6 square miles irrigated from channels, 89 from tanks and wells, and 7 from other sources. The number of tanks is 703, of which 133 are 'major' tanks.\n\nThe State forests cover an area of 93 square miles, 'reserved' lands 111, and plantations 121. The forest receipts in 1903-4 amounted to Rs. 42,000. One of the most important timbers is the kammar. There is no sandal-wood.\n\nClay ironstone constitutes some ranges of hills near Chitadroog town. Drawing slate is also found in the neighbourhood. Schorl in quartz is met with near Harihar. Potstone and actinolite occur frequently in pockets near Mattod. The latter has a considerable admixture of iron, and when decomposed becomes quite red. Asbestoid is found in the potstone near Talya, and ligniform asbestos among the M\u0101yakonda hills. Lamellar actinolite occurs at Harihar. A mineral resembling brown-spar is obtained near Talya and Anaji. Near the former place, and elsewhere among the Chitadroog hills, is found iron-glance. Carbonate of soda is abundant. Land has been taken up for exploration for gold to the north of Chitadroog, and gold-mining has been commenced at Borimaradi in the Hiriy\u016br taluk, but so far with uncertain results.\n\nThe most general manufactures are those of blankets and cotton cloth. The finest blankets are made in the D\u0101vangere and Jagal\u016br taluks, both white and black, as well as checked. Some have been turned out, valued at Rs. 200 to Rs. 300, of so fine a texture that they could be rolled up into a hollow bamboo, and yet were considered impervious to water. The ordinary kinds are made more or less everywhere. Cotton fabrics are produced in the greatest quantity near Harihar, in the Chitadroog taluk, and in the north of Molak\u0101lmuru. Coarse cloths are to some extent made in all taluks, and in D\u0101vangere and Hosdurga cotton thread is largely spun by the women. In the latter, red and coloured handkerchiefs are made. A large cotton-ginning factory has been established at D\u0101vangere by a European firm. Silk manufactures are confined to the Molak\u0101lmuru\nand Harihar taluks. In the former are produced cloths for men and women, with scarves and turbans, and women's saris of silk and cotton interwoven. In Harihar white and black check cloths are woven of raw silk from Bangalore. Iron and some steel are manufactured in the Hiriyur, Hosdurga, and Chitaldroog taluks. Brass vessels are prepared in the north of Molakalmuru. Glass bangles are made at Mattod, and leathern articles, such as slippers and buckets, in Molakalmuru. Blue and red dyes are manufactured at Harihar. There are reported to be 8 looms for silk, 7,677 for cotton, 1,354 for wool, 31 iron-works, 95 oil-mills, and 80 jaggery and sugar-mills.\n\nThe chief mart is Davangere. But there is also considerable traffic between the Nagar Malmad and the eastern Districts through Holalkere and Huliyar, and with Bellary and Districts to the north through Tallak and other places in the Challakere taluk. Agents of Bombay firms are stationed at Davangere for the purpose of buying up oilseeds, &c.\n\nThe Southern Mahratta Railway from Bangalore to Poona runs through the west of the District for 59 miles. The length of Provincial roads is 219 miles, and of District fund roads 248 miles.\n\nThe scanty rainfall especially exposes this District to threatenings of famine. In 1884\u20135, in 1891\u20132, and in 1895\u20136 there were symptoms of distress. In 1896\u20137 a remission was granted of half the assessment on waste 'wet' lands, as a measure of relief. The M\u00e4ri Kanaye reservoir and channels are designed as a protection against drought.\n\nThe District is divided into eight taluks\u2014Challakere, Chitaldroog, Davangere, Hiriyur, Holalkere, Hosdurga, Jagalur, and Molakalmuru. The following subdivisions were formed in 1903 and placed under Assistant Commissioners: Chitaldroog; Davangere, Holalkere, Hosdurga, and Jagalur, with head-quarters at Davangere; Challakere, Molakalmuru, and Hiriyur, with head-quarters at Chitaldroog.\n\nThe District and Subordinate Judge's courts at Shimoga have jurisdiction in this District, the former over the whole, and the latter over a part. At Chitaldroog there is a Subordinate Judge's court for the rest of the District. Near the frontier cases of serious crime are fairly common.\n\nThe land revenue and total revenue are shown below, in thousands of rupees:\n\n| Year   | Land Revenue | Total Revenue |\n|--------|--------------|---------------|\n| 1880-1 | 5.97         | 7.36          |\n| 1890-1 | 6.11         | 9.07          |\n| 1900-1 | 7.14         | 11.78         |\n| 1903-4 | 7.48         | 11.54         |\n\nThe revenue survey and settlement were introduced into the west\nbetween 1865 and 1868, and into the east in 1869 and 1872. The incidence of land revenue per acre of cultivated area in 1903-4 was Rs. 0-10-8. The average assessment per acre on 'dry' land is Rs. 0-5-10 (maximum scale Rs. 2, minimum scale Rs. 0-1-0); on 'wet' land, Rs. 2-13-5 (maximum scale Rs. 7, minimum scale Rs. 0-3-0); and on garden land, Rs. 3-15-7 (maximum scale Rs. 12, minimum scale Rs. 0-12-0).\n\nIn 1903-4 there were nine municipalities\u2014Chitaldroog, Davangere, Harihar, Hosdurga, Holalkere, Challakere, Hiriyur, Jagalur, and Molakalmuru\u2014with a total income of Rs. 41,000 and an expenditure of Rs. 55,000. There were also six Unions\u2014Bagur, Malebennur, Turnuvanur, Nayakanhatti, Rampur, and Devasamudra\u2014with a total income of Rs. 6,000 and a total expenditure of Rs. 14,000. The District and taluk boards had an income of Rs. 51,000, chiefly derived from a share of the Local fund cess, and spent Rs. 48,000, including Rs. 34,000 on roads and buildings.\n\nThe strength of the police force in 1903-4 was one superior officer, 88 subordinate officers, and 573 constables. There are 9 lock-ups, containing a daily average of 21 prisoners.\n\nThe percentage of literate persons in 1901 was 4.6 (8.6 males and 0.4 females). The number of schools rose from 435 with 9,058 pupils in 1890-1 to 437 with 12,417 pupils in 1900-1. In 1903-4 there were 427 schools (215 public and 212 private) with 10,719 pupils, of whom 1,071 were girls.\n\nBesides the civil hospital at Chitaldroog there are 10 dispensaries, at which 89,225 cases were treated in 1904, of whom 221 were in-patients, the number of beds available being 15 for men and 15 for women. The total expenditure was Rs. 21,000.\n\nThe number of persons vaccinated in 1904 was 5,347, or 11 per 1,000 of the population.\n\n**Chitaldroog Taluk.**\u2014Central taluk of Chitaldroog District, Mysore, lying between 14\u00b0 3' and 14\u00b0 28' N. and 76\u00b0 6' and 76\u00b0 35' E., with an area of 531 square miles. The population in 1901 was 83,205, compared with 66,546 in 1891. There are two towns, Chitaldroog (population, 5,792), the head-quarters, and Turuvanur (5,035); and 187 villages. The land revenue demand in 1903-4 was Rs. 1,22,000.\n\nA range of rocky hills running north and south divides the taluk into two almost equal portions. Towards the north the range is narrow and the hills bare and insignificant, but south of Chitaldroog it spreads out into greater width, and the hills are loftier and peculiarly striking in appearance. The country east and west of the range is comparatively flat and free from jungle. To the east black soil preponderates, while to the west the country is for the most part composed of red soil. The west is better supplied with reservoirs than the east and contains the\nlarge Bhimasamudra tank. 'Dry crops' are cultivated principally on the east side, r\u0101gi on the west side being frequently sown in garden and rice lands. The kind of rice cultivated is s\u0101l bhatta, which requires little water and thrives upon the rainfall alone, though generally planted near a tank or nullah in case of need.\n\nChitaldroog Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the District and taluk of the same name in Mysore, situated in 14\u00b0 13' N. and 76\u00b0 24' E., 24 miles north-east of Holalkere railway station. Population (1901), 5,792. Traces of an ancient city, named, it is said, Chandravali, are found immediately to the west. The Buddhist lead coins discovered there some time ago indicate that it belonged to the Andhra or S\u0101tav\u0101hana kings of the second century A.D. The modern town was owned in turn by the R\u0101shtrak\u016btas, Ch\u0101lukyas, Hoysalas, Seunas, and Vijayanagar, and was named Remmattanakallu or Bemmattan\u016bru. The Chitaldroog chiefs, of the Beda or Boya caste, after settling in various parts of the District, established themselves here in the sixteenth century, and on the fall of Vijayanagar assumed independence. Before this they had fortified the hill; and it received the name of Chitrakal-durga, perhaps for Chatrikal, 'umbrella rock,' there being a striking peak of this form to the south-west, considered sacred by both Hindus and Muhammadans. Another peak to the south has a temple of the goddess Obala at the top, a special object of worship to the Bedas. The principal temple in the town is that of Uchchangamma, a building of two storeys. The present extensive fortifications and batteries were erected at the end of the eighteenth century under Haidar Ali and Tip\u016b Sultan, by whom were also constructed the numerous granaries and pits for storing oil and ghi. The palace in the inner fort, erected by Tip\u016b, with a fine fruit garden, is now occupied as a kacheri. Beyond this was the arsenal, where a large mill, probably used for the manufacture of gunpowder, has lately been discovered. For some time after 1799 Chitaldroog was garrisoned by British troops, but was given up on account of its unhealthiness. To the north-west, 3 miles distant, is the Murgi math, the residence of the chief guru of the Sivabhaktas or Lingayats. Among a wildly rugged and picturesque group of hills to the west is the Ankli math, of recent date. A curious series of subterranean chambers, of various sizes at different levels, exists here. They contain shrines, lingams, baths, and pedestals, the latter apparently meant for yog\u0101sana. They may be 300 to 500 years old in their present form, but the caverns must have existed long before. At the Pancha Linga cave, near the entrance, is a Hoysala inscription of 1286. About 3 miles south of Chitaldroog is the Jogimaradi, a hill 3,803 feet high, which has been used as a hot-season resort. The municipality dates from 1870. The receipts and expenditure during the ten years ending 1901 averaged Rs. 13,200 and Rs. 13,100. In 1903-4 they were Rs. 11,000.\nChitaldroog Hills.\u2014A belt running from south to north through the middle of Chitaldroog District, Mysore State, lying between $13^\\circ 36'$ and $14^\\circ 42'$ N. and $76^\\circ 24'$ and $76^\\circ 36'$ E., a continuation of the Chiknayakanhalli auriferous band. The Jogimarad\u00ed hill, south of Chitaldroog, is a hot-season retreat, 3,803 feet high, and Chitaldroog itself is 3,229 feet above the sea. The latter is extensively fortified, the modern works dating from the time of Tip\u00fb Sult\u00e2n, about 1782. The hills are in intermittent parallel chains, mostly bare and stony; but some of the lower ridges are covered with fine grass and produce trees of middling size.\n\nChitarkot.\u2014Hill partly in B\u00e2nda District, United Provinces. See CHITRAKUT.\n\nChit Firozpur (also called Bar\u00e2g\u00e2on).\u2014Town in Ball\u00eea District, United Provinces, situated in $25^\\circ 45'$ N. and $84^\\circ$ E., on the right bank of the Chhot\u00ee Sarj\u00fb. Population (1901), 9,505. This is the centre of the Kausik R\u00e2jputs, but is merely a collection of mud houses, without regular streets. There are two large tanks, one of which is of masonry throughout and is the finest in the District. The town is administered under Act XX of 1856, with an income of about Rs. 1,400. There is a school with 55 pupils.\n\nChitor.\u2014Head-quarters of a z\u00eela or district of the same name in the State of Udaipur, R\u00e2jput\u00e2na, situated in $24^\\circ 53'$ N. and $74^\\circ 39'$ E., about 2 miles east of the Chitor railway station, which is a junction for the Udaipur-Chitor and R\u00e2jput\u00e2na-M\u00e2l\u00e2w\u00e2 Railways. It lies at the foot of the western slope of the hill on which stands the celebrated fort of Chitor. About half a mile to the west is the Gambh\u00eer river, a tributary of the Berach, which is spanned by a solid bridge of grey limestone with ten arches, said to have been built in the fourteenth century. Close to the railway station are the Government opium scales, which were moved here from Udaipur in November, 1883. All Mew\u00e2r opium exported to Bombay has to pass these scales; the number of chests so exported has varied from 8,288 in 1887\u20138 to 1,907 in 1902\u20133, but the annual average in recent years is about 4,400 chests. In 1901 the town and fort contained 7,593 inhabitants, of whom 68 per cent. were Hindus and 18 per cent. Musalm\u00e2ns. Chitor possesses an Anglo-vernacular school attended by 90 boys, and a hospital with accommodation for 12 in-patients.\n\nThe famous fort stands on a long narrow hill, lying almost exactly north and south and about 500 feet above the surrounding plain. Its length is about 3\u00bd miles and its greatest breadth half a mile, and it covers an area of about 690 acres. It is difficult to ascertain the correct date when the fort was built. Tradition ascribes it to Bh\u00eem, the second of the P\u00e2ndavas. Its old name was Chitrakot; and it was so called after Chitrang, the chief of the Mori R\u00e2jputs, who ruled here about\nthe seventh century, and whose tank and ruined palace are still to be seen in the southern portion of the hill. The fort was taken from the Moris by B\u0101p\u0101 R\u0101wal in 734, and remained the capital of the Mew\u0101r State till 1567, when the seat of government was moved to Udaipur city. The place has been four times taken and sacked by Musalm\u0101n kings and emperors: in 1303 by Al\u0101-ud-d\u012bn Khilj\u012b, who handed it over to his son Khizr Kh\u0101n and called it Khizr\u0101b\u0101d after him; about the middle of the fourteenth century by Muhammad bin Tughlak\u00b9; in 1534 by Bah\u0101dur Sh\u0101h of Gujar\u0101t; and in 1567 by Akbar. The fort has three main gates: namely, the R\u0101m Pol on the west, the S\u016braj Pol on the east, and the L\u0101khot\u0101 B\u0101ri on the north, the principal approach from the town being through the first of these gates. One of the most ancient buildings in the fort is the Kirtti Stambh or 'tower of fame,' erected by a Bagherw\u0101l Mah\u0101jan named Jija in the twelfth or thirteenth century and dedicated to Adin\u0101th, the first of the Jain T\u012brthankars. It has just been repaired under the general direction of the Government of India. The most prominent monument on the hill is the Jai Stambh or 'pillar of victory,' constructed between 1442 and 1449 by R\u0101n\u0101 Kumbha to commemorate his success over the combined armies of the Sult\u0101ns of M\u0101lw\u0101 and Gujar\u0101t. This tower is more than 120 feet in height and about 30 feet in diameter at the base; a staircase passes up through its nine storeys, winding alternately through a central well and a gallery formed round it. The whole, from basement to summit, is covered with the most elaborate ornament, either in figures belonging to the Hindu pantheon, each carefully named, or in architectural scrolls and foliage, all in perfect subordination to the general design. Tod thought that the only thing in India to compare with it was the Kutb Min\u0101r at Delhi, which, though much higher, was of very inferior character, while Fergusson considered it to be in infinitely better taste as an architectural object than the Pillar of Trajan at Rome, though possibly inferior in sculpture. Among other buildings may be mentioned the graceful and richly carved little temple called Sing\u0101r Chaori, constructed in 1448; and that dedicated to K\u0101lk\u0101 Devi, which is the oldest building standing in the fort and was originally a temple to the Sun. A few Buddhist votive st\u016bpas have been found on the hill, and are now regarded by the people as lingams. About 7 miles north of Chitor, on the right bank of the Berach river, is the village of Nagari, one of the most ancient places in R\u0101jput\u0101na, belonging to the Rao of Bedia. Several coins and a fragmentary inscription of a period anterior to the Christian era have been discovered here. There are also a couple of Buddhist st\u016bpas, and an enclosure of huge cut blocks of stone which was originally a Buddhist building of some\n\n\u00b9 It is, however, doubtful if Muhammad bin Tughlak ever besieged or took the fort; see Udaipur State.\nkind, but was used by Akbar for his elephants and is consequently called H\u0101thi-k\u0101-b\u0101r\u0101. To the north of Naguri is a hollow tower or pyramidal column called Akb\u0101r's lamp, which was built by him when besieging Chitor.\n\n[J.

The hill lies partly in the Karw\u012b tahsil and partly in the Chaube j\u0101g\u012br of K\u0101mt\u0101 Rajol\u0101. The Paisuni river flows nearly a mile from its base, which has a circumference of three or four miles. A terrace, constructed by the R\u0101n\u012b of Chhatars\u0101l about 1725, and repaired as a famine work in 1896\u20137, runs round the hill-side. In former times the hill was more frequented as a place of pilgrimage than any other in Bundelkhand or Baghelkhand. It is said to have attained its great sanctity in the Tret\u0101yuga, or the third epoch of the Hindu cosmogony, when it was visited by R\u0101ma and S\u012bt\u0101 during their wanderings in the jungles. More than thirty shrines, dedicated to various deities, crown the surrounding hills, or fringe the banks of the Paisuni. The small town of Sit\u0101pur, on the banks of the river, is largely inhabited by attendant priests. The temple attendants enjoy the revenues of forty-two mah\u0101ls within British territory, besides several others in the adjoining Native States. Two large fairs take place annually, on the occasion of the R\u0101m-naumt and Dew\u0101li festivals, which formerly attracted 30,000 and 45,000 persons respectively. The attendance has now shrunk to a few thousands, as R\u0101j\u0101s do not attend the festivals, and the Mar\u0101th\u0101 family of Karw\u012b has become impoverished. Since 1897 plague regulations have still further reduced the number of pilgrims.\n\n**Chitr\u0101l State.**\u2014State in the D\u012br, Sw\u0101t, and Chitr\u0101l Agency of the North-West Frontier Province, lying between $35\u00b0 15' and 37\u00b0 8' N.$ and $71\u00b0 22' and 74\u00b0 6' E.$, with an area of about 4,500 square miles. The State derives its name from the village of Chitr\u0101l, situated in\nIt comprises the whole of Kashk\u0101r B\u0101la or Upper Kashk\u0101r, i.e., the Tirich valley, which runs northward from Tirich M\u012br for 60 miles until it joins the T\u016brikho valley; thence the combined streams run south for 40 miles through the Mulkho valley and join the Kho valley below Mast\u016bj. The T\u016brikho valley lies north-east and southwest parallel with the Y\u0101r Kh\u016bn, and has a length of 60 miles.\n\nThe boundaries of Chitr\u0101l are: on the north, the Hindu Kush range; on the west, Badakhsh\u0101n and K\u0101f\u012brist\u0101n; on the south, Dir; and on the east, the Gilgit Agency, Mast\u016bj, and Y\u0101sin.\n\nIt is recorded in a Sanskrit inscription carved on a rock near Barenis in Mast\u016bj that about the year A.D. 900 the inhabitants of the surrounding country were Buddhists, and under the sway of Jaip\u0101l, king of K\u0101bul. A local legend tells of attacks on Chitr\u0101l by Chingiz Kh\u0101n and his Tartars, but the history of the country is practically lost before the sixteenth century. At that time a prince, whose name or title was Rais, was on the throne; and his first subject was one Sang\u012bn Ali, a foreigner of unknown origin, who however is said to have come from Khor\u0101s\u0101n, by which is meant the hill country between Ghazni and Kandah\u0101r. Sang\u012bn Ali died in 1570, leaving four sons, two of whom made themselves all-powerful in the country, ousting the Rais dynasty. From the second son the present Mehtar's house is descended, while the chief clans of the Adamz\u0101das take their names from Sang\u012bn Ali's grandsons. The ruling dynasty has thus maintained itself on the throne for more than 300 years, during the greater part of which Chitr\u0101l, with or without Mast\u016bj, has been constantly at war with her neighbours\u2014Gilgit, Y\u0101sin, the Sikh governor of Kashmir, the Chil\u0101sis, and the Path\u0101n tribes to the south. In 1854 the Mah\u0101r\u0101ja of Kashmir made alliance with Sh\u0101h Afzal, Mehtar of Chitr\u0101l, against Gauhar Aman, the ruler of Y\u0101sin and Mast\u016bj, who was invading Gilgit, a State tributary to Kashmir. A confused period of war and intrigue followed, in which the chief event was the unsuccessful invasion of Chitr\u0101l in 1868 by the ruler of Badakhsh\u0101n, acting under pressure from K\u0101bul. From this Am\u0101n-ul-mulk, the youngest son of Sh\u0101h Afzal, finally emerged about 1880 as master of Chitr\u0101l, Mast\u016bj, Y\u0101sin, and Ghizr. The Kashmir Darb\u0101r, which with the approval of the Government of India had been in alliance with him since 1878, in opposition to the possibility of Afghan aggression, now formally recognized him and doubled the subsidy granted to him.\n\nIn 1885\u20136 Chitr\u0101l was visited by the Lockhart mission; and in 1889, on the establishment of a Political Agency in Gilgit, Am\u0101n-ul-mulk received a subsidy from the British Government of Rs. 6,000 per annum. Some rifles were also given to him. In 1891 this subsidy was increased to Rs. 12,000, on condition that he accepted the advice of Government\nin all matters connected with foreign policy and the defence of the frontier.\n\nIn 1892 Am\u0101n-ul-mulk died suddenly. His second son, Afzal-ul-mulk, who happened to be on the spot, seized the throne. The eldest son, Niz\u0101m-ul-mulk, governor of Y\u0101sin, fled to Gilgit. Before Afzal-ul-mulk had fairly embarked on the necessary extirpation of his other half-brothers, Umr\u0101 Kh\u0101n of Jandol, who was at this time master of Dir, invaded Chitr\u0101l territory, and seized the fort and district of Narsat. Afzal-ul-mulk was about to march against him when his uncle Sher Afzal, who had been a refugee in Afghanistan, returned suddenly with a small following. Chitr\u0101l fort was opened to him, and in the confusion that followed Afzal-ul-mulk was murdered. Sher Afzal proclaimed himself Mehtar. Niz\u0101m-ul-mulk was then allowed to re-enter Chitr\u0101l from Gilgit. Sher Afzal, believing him to have British support, fled before him, and Niz\u0101m-ul-mulk in turn ascended the throne. He was recognized by Government, and a Political Agency was established in Chitr\u0101l.\n\nIn January, 1895, Niz\u0101m-ul-mulk was murdered at the instigation of his half-brother Amir-ul-mulk, acting as the tool of Umr\u0101 Kh\u0101n, who was still in occupation of Narsat and had espoused the cause of Sher Afzal. Amir-ul-mulk seized the fort. Umr\u0101 Kh\u0101n crossed the Lawari pass with an army, giving out that he was conducting a religious war against the infidels, and asking Amir-ul-mulk to join him. Amir-ul-mulk was unable or unwilling to comply, and Umr\u0101 Kh\u0101n laid siege to Drosh, which he took after about a month's investment. Meanwhile, the Political Agent at Gilgit had been sent to Chitr\u0101l to report on the situation. With his escort, which by reinforcements had been brought up to a strength of over 400 men, of whom 300 belonged to the Kashmir Imperial Service troops, he occupied the fort. All seemed well when suddenly Sher Afzal reappeared on the scene. He was supported by Umr\u0101 Kh\u0101n, and was shortly joined by the bulk of the ruling class, the Adamz\u0101das, with their adherents. Amir-ul-mulk made overtures to them and was consequently placed under restraint in the fort; and Shuj\u0101-ul-mulk, a lad of fourteen, his brother, was provisionally recognized as Mehtar. The garrison of the fort made an ineffective sortie, and were then besieged from March 3 till April 19. During the continuance of the siege two notable successes were gained elsewhere by the enemy. The first was the treacherous capture at Buni of two British officers, the destruction of their following, and the seizure of 40,000 rounds of ammunition. The two officers were kept as prisoners by Umr\u0101 Kh\u0101n at Munda for nearly a month, and were then released on the approach of the relief force. The other success was the practical annihilation near Resh\u016bng of a detachment of 100 men of the 14th Sikhs under Captain Ross. At Chitr\u0101l, however, the besieged, though in considerable straits, held out gallantly until the approach of\na small force from Gilgit caused their assailants to withdraw. A week later (April 26) the advance guard of the main relief force, which had been dispatched via the Malakand and Dir, entered Chitral territory over the Lawarai pass. Sher Afzal was taken prisoner and Umr\u0101 Kh\u0101n fled to Afghan territory. Sher Afzal, Amir-ul-mulk, and their leading followers were deported to India, and the selection of Shuj\u0101-ul-mulk as Mehtar was confirmed. Since then Chitral has enjoyed an unwonted peace. The British garrison, most of which is stationed at Drosh, has been reduced to a single regiment of native infantry, relieved annually by the Swat and Dir route. Hospitals have been opened at Chitral, Mastuj, and Drosh. Cultivation has been extended and the Mehtar's revenue continues to increase, while at the same time his mental horizon has been much enlarged by his visits to Calcutta in 1900, to the Delhi Darbar in 1903, and to Peshawar in 1904.\n\nMention should here be made of the Chitral levies, 200 strong, who were raised in 1899 for the defence of Lower Chitral. In 1903 the Chitral Scouts were raised, with the Mehtar as honorary commandant. Their object is to provide a wholly irregular force of cragsmen for the defence of the country in case of invasion. The corps has a total strength of 1,200 men, but all of these are never embodied at one time.\n\nThe present inhabitants of Chitral are divided into three strata: Adamzadas, Arb\u0101bzadas, and fakir miskin (literally, 'poor beggars'). The last form the majority of the population and till the soil, paying the usual tithe in revenue. The other classes are exempt from taxation. The theory that these three classes represent successive waves of invaders is probably correct, but the origin of all three is unknown. The Adamzadas at least are certainly of Aryan descent; and the language of the country, Khowar, is classed with Shin\u0101, or the language of Gilgit, as Indo-Aryan but non-Sanskritic. The total population numbers about 50,000.\n\nThe religion of the people is now Islam, but their conversion is recent, dating from early in the fourteenth to late in the sixteenth century, and many primitive beliefs and customs survive. Most of the people of Lut-kho belong to the Maulai sect, whose head is the Agha Kh\u0101n, the chief of the Khoja community at Bombay. His agents yearly convey to him the offerings of his adherents. The local religious leaders are the firs, to each of whom is assigned a tract of country, and under whom are khalfas or collectors of offerings. One tenet of the sect is said to be a belief in metempsychosis. Fanaticism is markedly absent throughout the country.\n\nAll three valleys\u2014the T\u016brikho, M\u016blkho, and Tirich\u2014are fertile in the extreme, and are cultivated continuously. The soil is mostly clay and gravel, and the hill-sides are generally bare. The chief crops are wheat, barley, maize, and rice.\nIron, copper, and orpiment of superior quality are found in Kashk\u0101r, and are mined, a few villages being almost wholly employed in the industry. Inferior cotton carpets are made for local use, and the Chitr\u0101l daggers and sword-hilts are in great demand in the neighbouring valleys.\n\nThe country is divided into eight districts, each under an at\u0101lik, who collects its revenue and leads its men in war. Below the at\u0101lik is the charwela, who has charge of a group of villages, generally lying in one valley. Each village is under a baram\u016bsh or headman, who maintains roads, forts, and bridges, assisted by a charb\u016b as deputy. The internal administration of the country is conducted by the Mehtar, with as little interference as possible. The foreign policy of the State is regulated by the Political Agent under the orders of the British Government.\n\nThe precepts of the Muhammadan law are nominally enforced and the Mull\u0101s have considerable influence, often for good. Justice, however, is virtually administered at the ruler's will. Petty cases are decided by the at\u0101lik.\n\nThe regular land revenue of the country is realized solely from the fakir misk\u012bn class, who pay a tithe of their agricultural produce and other dues in kind. Shepherds also pay in kind. In practice these dues are not fixed, and as much as possible is wrung from the people. Fixed dues are also levied on the through trade with Badakhsh\u0101n. The practice of selling Kho women, proverbial for their beauty, in Pesh\u0101war, K\u0101bul, and Badakhsh\u0101n, was formerly recognized as a legitimate source of revenue, and made Chitr\u0101l a great resort of slave-dealers. Of recent years, however, the market for slaves has become circumscribed, and the system is now limited to the sale of girl children to supply the harems of K\u0101bul, Badakhsh\u0101n, and a few other territories.\n\nChitr\u0101l Town (Chitr\u0101r or Kashk\u0101r).\u2014Town, or rather group of villages, forming the capital of the State of Chitr\u0101l, North-West Frontier Province, situated in $35^\\circ 51'$ N. and $71^\\circ 50'$ E. Population, about 7,380. It lies on the Chitr\u0101l river, and contains a small bazar, recently enlarged, in which petty traders from B\u0101jaur and Badakhsh\u0101n drive a fairly brisk trade. The Assistant Political Agent in Chitr\u0101l resides here.\n\nChitr\u0101v\u0101s.\u2014Petty State in K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r, Bombay.\n\nChittagong Division.\u2014Division of Eastern Bengal and Assam, lying between $20^\\circ 35'$ and $24^\\circ 16'$ N. and $90^\\circ 34'$ and $92^\\circ 42'$ E., in the extreme south of the Province. It is bounded on the west by the Bay of Bengal; on the north-west by the Dacca Division; on the north-east by Sylhet and Hill Tippera; on the east by the Lush\u0101r Hills and North Arakan; and on the south by Arakan. It comprises four Districts, as shown in the following table:\u2014\nThe head-quarters of the Division are at Chittagong Town. The recorded population was 3,441,430 in 1872, 3,569,071 in 1881, 4,190,081 in 1891, and 4,737,731 in 1901. The most marked characteristic is the large number of Muhammadans, who in 1901 constituted 3,333,000, or 70 per cent. of the whole population; Hindus numbered 1,251,000, or 26 per cent., and Buddhists 150,000, or 3 per cent., while there were 2,443 Christians and 800 of other religions. The density of population is 402 persons per square mile, or 695, if the sparsely inhabited Hill Tracts are excluded. The Division contains 6 towns and 9,740 villages. The only town with a population exceeding 20,000 is Chittagong (22,140), but Comilla (19,169) and Brahmanbaria (19,915) very nearly approach that figure.\n\nThe position of Chittagong as the base for operations against the Lushais before they were turned into peaceable British subjects formerly gave the Division a much greater political importance than it now possesses. As chairman of the Commissioners of the Chittagong port, the Commissioner has to deal with a number of commercial questions; and in the Chittagong Hill Tracts he exercises direct administrative control, and has the powers of a Sessions Judge and of an Inspector-General of police. The Government estates in this Division are more important than in any other, especially in Chittagong District, the aggregate rental being 8.43 lakhs, or nearly a third of the total land revenue. No less than 2,685 square miles are 'reserved' as forest. Chittagong is the chief port in Eastern Bengal, and Chandpur, on the Meghna, is a rapidly growing jute centre which taps one of the most important jute-growing tracts in the world, while Sitakund is a much-frequented place of pilgrimage. The State of Hill Tippera is under the political supervision of the Commissioner.\n\nChittagong District (Chattagram).\u2014District in the Division of the same name, Eastern Bengal and Assam, lying between 20\u00b0 35' and 22\u00b0 59' N. and 91\u00b0 30' and 92\u00b0 23' E., with an area of 2,492 square miles. It lies on the east of the Bay of Bengal, and is separated on the south from the Akyab District of Burma by the Naaf estuary; on\nthe north the Fenny river divides it from Noakhali and Tippera Districts; and on the east lie the Chittagong Hill Tracts. In shape it resembles an acute-angled triangle, 166 miles in length, its base resting on the river Fenny and its apex terminating in the promontory of Teknaaf; its breadth along the northern boundary is 26 miles, while along the southern it is only 4 miles.\n\nThe prominent characteristic of an extensive tract of country lying to the east of the Bay of Bengal is the succession of low ranges of hills, which run in a south-easterly direction parallel to each other and to the coast-line. Chittagong District comprises a section of the three most westerly of these ranges, and of the four valleys intersected by them.\n\nPhysical aspects. The first of the ranges rises almost from the sea at the northern extremity of Maiskh\u0101l island, of which it forms the backbone. It reappears at Cox's B\u0101z\u0101r on the east of the Maiskh\u0101l channel in precipitous cliffs along the whole length of the coast, and terminates in the promontory of Teknaaf. The central range forms the Sit\u0101kund hills in the north of the District and, proceeding southwards, is named successively the Diy\u0101ng, B\u0101nskh\u0101li, and Garjania hills. But little of the eastern range is in Chittagong District, which it enters a few miles north of the Karnaphuli river, disappearing again into the Hill Tracts after forming the Pati\u0101 hills between the Karnaphuli and Sangu rivers. The low hills, clothed with luxuriant vegetation, and the winding rivers, meandering through verdant plains interspersed with groves of bamboos and betel-nut palms, combine to form a very pleasing panorama.\n\nThe rivers traverse the District in a south-westerly direction at right angles to the ranges of hills, the watershed lying in the higher hills of the more easterly ranges in the Hill Tracts. The most important rivers are the Fenny, which marks the northern boundary, the Karnaphuli, near the mouth of which lies the town of Chittagong, the Sangu, and the M\u0101t\u0101muh\u0101ri. The District is thus divided into valleys, running from north to south, which are bounded on the east and west by hills and on the north and south by rivers, each valley being drained by affluents of the said rivers. The tributaries of the Karnaphuli are the Ich\u0101matt\u012b, Sylok, Hald\u0101, and Bo\u0101lkh\u0101li, while the Sangu receives the Dolu, Ch\u0101ndkh\u0101li, and Kumir\u0101.\n\nThe hills are formed of sandstones and clays of the Upper Tertiary period, and the valleys have been filled by alluvial deposits of sand and clay washed down from the hill-sides or dropped by the rivers when in flood.\n\nAlong the coast, and particularly on the low islands that fringe it, is found a scanty vegetation of Ischaemum and various other grasses and littoral or swamp-forest species. The lower hills that separate the river valleys are mainly covered with a shrubby jungle; the higher hills are\nclothed with a dense jungle largely composed of gigantic trees, among which the most conspicuous are various *gurjans* (*Dipterocarpus turbinatus*), but with which are associated many *Laurineae*, *Leguminosae*, *Rubiaceae*, *Euphorbiaceae*, oaks and chestnuts, *Ternstroemiaceae*, *Meliaceae*, and *Urticaceae*. Palms are plentiful, and *Cycas* is abundant. *Casuarina equisetifolia* finds its northern natural limit in the extreme south of the District.\n\nThe forest-clad hills swarm with game. Wild elephants ravage the eastern valleys, and bison are found in the northern hills. Tigers are frequently shot, and leopards, deer, and wild cats abound.\n\nOwing to its position on the coast-line of the north-east angle of the Bay, towards which the moist winds of the south-west monsoon converge, the District is remarkable for its uniform temperature, high humidity, and heavy rainfall from May to October. Owing to the differences of elevation and the increasing height of the hills towards the east, the rainfall varies largely from place to place, and while at Cox's Bazar it is 140 inches, at Chittagong it is only 105. For the whole District, the average fall is 111 inches, of which 11-5 inches fall in May, 22-5 in June, 28 in July, 21-4 in August, 11-6 in September, and 6-7 in October.\n\nThe District is especially liable to cyclones, and five very destructive storms have visited it during the last 110 years. On June 3, 1795, a severe gale blew from seven o'clock in the evening till past midnight. Heavy rain followed, the Collector's *kacheri* was totally unroofed, and only five brick-built houses survived in Chittagong town. Two years later a furious hurricane passed over the District. Two vessels lying at anchor in the port were sunk, and almost every native hut was levelled to the ground; several lives were lost. In October, 1872, a cyclone passed over the Cox's Bazar subdivision, inflicting considerable damage; many lives were lost and numbers of cattle destroyed. The Backergunge cyclone and storm-wave of October 31, 1876, swept the seaboard with still more disastrous results. The inundation extended from 3 to 6 miles inland, and the damage was especially widespread in the neighbourhood of estuaries and the mouths of rivers. About 12,000 persons were drowned on this occasion, and 15,000 perished in the cholera epidemic that ensued. The cyclone of October 24, 1897, will long be remembered as the most disastrous on record. The hurricane reached its maximum intensity about midnight, when a series of storm-waves swept over the island of Kutubdia and the villages on the mainland near the coast, drowning thousands of men and cattle, sweeping away homesteads, and destroying the standing crops. The loss of life by drowning was estimated at 14,000 and, owing to the pollution of the water-supply, a severe epidemic of cholera broke out, which caused a further mortality of 18,000. The dikes along the seaboard were\nwashed away, and immense injury was done to buildings in Chittagong town and throughout the District.\n\nChittagong originally formed part of the extensive Hindu kingdom of Tippera; but it was conquered by the Buddhist king of Arakan in the ninth century, and from that date onwards History. the Arakanese appear to have generally succeeded in retaining possession of the District. In the thirteenth century Chittagong was temporarily annexed to the Mughal empire, but the king of Tippera defeated the Muhammadans in 1512 and reconquered the country. Subsequently it again fell into the hands of the Mughals, and in 1538 a Portuguese mission from Goa to the governor of Bengal landed here; the latter, suspecting the intentions of the envoys, imprisoned them, and the Portuguese in revenge burnt the town. During the struggle for supremacy between the Mughals and Afghans, between 1560 and 1570, Chittagong was reconquered by the king of Arakan and annexed to his kingdom as a tributary province; this fact, however, was ignored by the Mughals, and the District was assessed in 1582 by Todar Mal as an integral part of the empire.\n\nIn order to maintain their hold on the District the Arakanese, or Maghs as they are called in Bengal, imported a force of Portuguese outlaws, and made over to them the port of Chittagong as a pirate harbour. These renegades, who are generally known as Firinghis, soon began to give trouble, and in 1605 they threw off their allegiance. Being driven out of Chittagong, they took refuge in the island of Sandwip, from which coign of vantage they vied with their late masters in harrying the coasts of Bengal; and their depredations soon became so serious that, in 1608, the capital of the governor of Bengal was removed to Dacca that he might be better able to control the operations against them. In 1638 Matak Rai, who held Chittagong on behalf of the R\u0101ja of Arakan, quarrelled with his master and sought the protection of the Mughals. He acknowledged himself the vassal of the Delhi empire and nominally made over the District to the governor of Bengal, who does not appear, however, to have taken effective possession. Meanwhile the depredations of the Maghs and Firinghis had become intolerable, and in 1664\u20135 Shaista Kh\u0101n, the governor of Bengal, dispatched a strong force against them. The expedition was a complete success; the ports at the mouth of the Meghna and on Sandwip island were captured by the fleet, the Firinghis were induced to desert the cause of the R\u0101ja of Arakan, and the town of Chittagong was carried by storm (1666). It was thereupon reannexed to Bengal and the name was changed to Isl\u0101m\u0101b\u0101d, the \u2018residence of the Faithful.\u2019 Many of the Firinghis were removed to Dacca, where their descendants still reside.\n\nTwenty years afterwards (1685), the East India Company sent out an expedition under Admiral Nicholson, with instructions to seize\nChittagong and fortify it on behalf of the English. This expedition proved abortive. Two years later the Court of Directors determined to make Chittagong the head-quarters of their Bengal trade, and Captain Heath was sent out with a fleet of ten or eleven ships to seize it; but when he reached Chittagong early in 1689, he found the place too strongly held, and abandoned the attempt. The District thus remained in the possession of the Mughals until 1760, when it was ceded to the East India Company along with Burdwan and Midnapore by the Naw\u0101b Mir K\u0101sim. The administration was placed in the hands of an English Chief with a council.\n\nWhen Arakan was conquered by the Burmans in 1784, large numbers of its inhabitants fled to Chittagong. The Burmans demanded their surrender, and the refusal of the British to give them up was one of the causes that led to the first Burmese War. Repeated aggressions on the frontier culminated, in September, 1823, in the forcible seizure by the Burmans of the island of Sh\u0101hpuri at the mouth of the Naaf river, which had been for many years in the undisturbed possession of the British. In the war which ensued, a strong Burmese force, marching on Chittagong, surrounded and annihilated a British detachment of 300 sepoys with 2 guns at R\u0101mu, a few miles east of Cox's B\u0101z\u0101r. Before the Burmese commander could follow up his success, the setting in of the rains rendered the roads impassable; and soon afterwards, on the capture of Rangoon, the Arakan force was recalled.\n\nDuring the Mutiny of 1857 three companies of the 34th Native Infantry stationed at Chittagong broke into mutiny on the night of November 18. They plundered the treasury, released the prisoners in the jail, murdered a native constable, and marched off, without molesting the residents, along the borders of Hill Tippera into Sylhet and Cachar, where they were almost all killed or captured by the Sylhet Light Infantry (now the 10th Gurkha Rifles) and Kuki scouts.\n\nThe population of the District as now constituted increased from 1,127,402 in 1872 to 1,132,341 in 1881, to 1,290,167 in 1891, and to 1,353,250 in 1901. Owing to the cyclone of October, 1897, the growth of population during the last decade was only 4.9 per cent. Chittagong town is malarious, but elsewhere the climate is fairly healthy. The principal disease is fever, but cholera also claims its victims. Insanity is very prevalent. The principal statistics of the Census of 1901 are shown in the table on next page.\n\nThe towns are Chittagong, the head-quarters, and Cox's B\u0101z\u0101r. More than a third of the District (851 square miles) is covered by hill and jungle, and the density in the inhabited area is 825 persons per square mile, rising to 1,629 in the th\u0101na of Chittagong. Since the cyclone of 1897 many of the old Magh immigrants seem to have returned to Arakan. There is also a large temporary\nexodus thither of harvesters, boatmen, and coolies; and it was owing to their absence at the time of the Census of 1901 that Chittagong alone, of all the Eastern Bengal Districts, showed a preponderance of females over males. Of the people, 98 per cent. speak a corrupt dialect of Bengali, known from the name of the District as Chatgaiya; the Maghs speak a kind of Burmese. No less than 72 per cent. of the population are Muhammadans. Most of these are local converts or their descendants, but there are also a number of foreigners whose ancestors formed part of the invading army of 1666. The proportion of Hindus (24 per cent.) is lower than in any Eastern Bengal District except Bogra and Rajshahi.\n\n| Subdivision | Area in square miles | Number of Towns | Villages | Population | Population per square mile | Percentage of variation in population between 1891 and 1901 | Number of persons able to read and write |\n|-------------|---------------------|----------------|---------|------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Chittagong  | 1,596               | 1              | 1,217   | 1,153,081  | 722                       | + 4.6                                           | 70,413                                 |\n| Cox's Bazar | 896                 | 1              | 233     | 200,169    | 223                       | + 6.5                                           | 7,906                                  |\n| District total | 2,492             | 2              | 1,450   | 1,353,250  | 543                       | + 4.9                                           | 78,319                                 |\n\nThe majority of the Muhammadans call themselves Shaikhs, but 9,000 claim to be Saiyids and 2,000 Pathans. The Buddhists (65,000) are nearly all Maghs, who are either pure Arakanese, or the offspring of Bengali fathers and Arakanese mothers; the latter are known as Barua Maghs. Of the Hindus the Kayasths (71,000) are the most numerous caste; many of them, and of the Baidyas (7,000), are the descendants of revenue officials employed by the early Arakanese, Musalm\u0101n, and British rulers. Many of the Sudras (58,000) occupy a quasi-servile position, and hold their lands for services rendered. The weaving caste of Jugis has 35,000 representatives. Br\u0101hmans (24,000) congregate in the neighbourhood of the famous shrines of Sit\u0101kund and Adin\u0101th. Only 60 per cent. of the population are dependent on agriculture, by far the lowest proportion in Eastern Bengal.\n\nThe number of Christians (1,237) is swollen by the inclusion of the Firinghi community at Chittagong, who are Roman Catholics. The number of native Christians is only 49. There is a very old Catholic church with a convent, where Firinghi boys and girls are educated; the church owns some landed property in the District. A Baptist missionary is also at work and has made a few converts.\n\nExcept on the hills, the soil is everywhere alluvial, consisting of a mixture of clay and sand. In the neighbourhood of the sea-shore and within the reach of the tides stiff clay predominates; this is the least fertile soil in the District, and is rapidly exhausted. Farther inland the drainage from the hills sweeps\ndown quantities of sand, and the admixture of this with the alluvial clay forms the fertile loam which is the prevailing soil of the District. The hill streams are also heavily charged with organic matter from the decaying vegetation in the hills, and the silt which their waters deposit acts like manure and enables a rich succession of crops to be harvested. On low land winter (transplanted) rice is the main crop; it is often followed by a catch-crop of pulses. Higher lands grow a double rice crop, the earlier being harvested in August, and the later in December. Round the homesteads tobacco, chillies, the *Aha* creeper, sugar-cane, and vegetables are grown; and on the river banks and sandy flats hemp, tobacco, melons, and pumpkins luxuriate. The sandy hills grow nothing but thatching grass. All along the coast-line, and up the creeks within reach of tidal water, embankments are necessary to exclude the salt water, which is fatal to rice cultivation.\n\nThe chief agricultural statistics for 1903-4 are shown below, areas being in square miles:\n\n| Subdivision | Total | Cultivated | Cultivable waste | Forests |\n|-------------|-------|------------|------------------|---------|\n| Chittagong   | 1,596 | 764        | 161.5            | 237     |\n| Cox's Bazar  | 896   | 153        | 9.3              | 49      |\n| **Total**    | **3,492** | **917**    | **161.8**        | **286** |\n\nLess than half the total area (including forests) is fit for cultivation; the uncultivable area comprises the sandy hills which traverse the District and the deltaic scrub forests in the south.\n\nBy far the most important crop is winter rice, which occupies three-fourths of the cultivated area; early rice, including the early irrigated (*Anya*) variety, is grown on a fifth of the cropped area. Hemp thrives on the banks of the Sangu and in the neighbourhood of Sitakund, but jute is only a garden crop; good tobacco is cultivated in the Matumuhari valley. Tea is grown on 4,000 acres belonging to seventeen gardens. Most of the estates were purchased in fee-simple about forty years ago, and are situated on the low hills which are unfit for rice cultivation. Thatching-grass covers about 36 square miles of the hilly slopes; it does not require much cultivation, though the weeding is troublesome.\n\nThe cultivated area has increased by 18 per cent. in the last sixty years, and in the more remote parts the scrub jungle is still being cleared; in the deltaic country in the south reclamation is also spreading. A model farm has recently been opened near Chittagong town. Loans are rarely taken, but after the cyclone of 1897 1.2 lakhs was advanced for the restoration of the embankments which had been breached by the storm-wave.\nThe breeds of cattle are poor: the most valuable are buffaloes, which find abundant grazing in the forests and on the river flats. Pasture abounds in most parts, but in the highly cultivated central valleys it is scarce so long as the rice crop is on the ground.\n\nThe early spring rice crop is generally irrigated by damming a hill stream. Rice seedling-beds are watered from tanks and ditches; and sugar-cane, chillies, the p\u0101n creeper, and vegetable crops are irrigated in the same way.\n\nDeep-sea fishing is practised in the Bay, the catch being dried on shore and sold in large quantities. Every river, tank, and ditch swarms with fish, which are caught in every variety of net and trap, and form an important item in the diet of the people. At Cox's B\u0101z\u0101r excellent pomfret, soles, and oysters are to be had.\n\nNearly one-third of the District is covered by forests, and an area of 286 square miles has been 'reserved.' The most valuable trees are the\n\nForests. t\u016bn (Cedrela Toona), gurjan (Dipterocarpus turbinate), j\u0101rul (Lagerstroemia Flos Reginae), n\u0101geswar (Mesua ferrea), gamh\u0101r (Gmelina arborea), and ch\u0101pl\u0101s (Artocarpus Chaplasha). Canes and bamboos grow luxuriantly everywhere and are the most valuable produce of the forests, and a quantity of firewood is cut on the islands in the delta of the M\u0101t\u0101muhari. In 1903\u20134 the receipts of the Forest department amounted to Rs. 15,000.\n\nTea is the only important manufacture; the out-turn in 1903 was 1,370,000 lb. Coarse cloth is woven in Pah\u0101rtali, and the Magh women of Cox's B\u0101z\u0101r make silk and cotton lungis or kilts; but both industries are decaying. Bamboo mats and baskets and fishing-nets are manufactured for local use, and fine mats are woven of a reed known as sit\u0101lp\u0101ti (Phrynium dichotomum) and are to some extent exported. Chittagong was formerly famous for its ship-building, but the industry is moribund; only three vessels were built in 1901\u20132 and none since that year. There is a rice mill at Chittagong.\n\nThe trade of the port is dealt with in the article on CHITTAGONG Town. The chief exports are jute (sent from N\u0101riyanganj), rice husked and unhusked (mainly from No\u0101kh\u0101li and Tippera), and tea (from Assam). Cotton is also brought down from the Hill Tracts and exported. The imports, in addition to the items which are re-exported, are piece-goods, metals, sugar, salt, and oil. The chief centres of trade in the interior are Cox's B\u0101z\u0101r, Teknaaf, Mah\u0101jan's H\u0101t on the borders of No\u0101kh\u0101li, and Naz\u012br's H\u0101t on the Hald\u0101 river.\n\nThe Assam-Bengal Railway, which was opened for passenger traffic in 1895, traverses the District for nearly 50 miles before it crosses the Fenny and passes into No\u0101kh\u0101li. The branch line from L\u0101ksh\u0101m westwards to Ch\u0101ndpur establishes communication with Calcutta, via the\nIndia General Steam Navigation Company's steamers to Goalundo and the Eastern Bengal State Railway, the journey occupying 24 hours. Excluding 345 miles of village tracks, there are 533 miles of road maintained by the District board, but, with the exception of only 3 miles, the roads are all unmetalled, and very imperfectly bridged. The Dacca trunk road is maintained by the District board, and is bridged as far as the Fenny river (45 miles), which is crossed by a ferry. The R\u0101mgarh road runs north-east to the border of the District, the Hill Tracts road branching east from it at H\u0101thaz\u0101ri. The Arakan road runs due south to Akyab; the R\u0101mu road leaves it at the 58th mile and connects with Ukhil Gh\u0101\u1e6d on the Naaf estuary, and another branch runs to Cox's B\u0101z\u0101r. The Ch\u0101ndpur road is more or less parallel to, and west of, the Arakan road, which it joins at the 38th mile; and the Jaldi road, which is still unfinished, is intended to connect Ch\u0101ndpur with the Arakan road.\n\nSouth of the Karnaphuli the traffic is carried almost entirely by water, the main rivers being connected by north and south cross-channels, which are partly artificial and are maintained by the District board. By these waterways inland communication can be had at all seasons from Chittagong southwards to Cox's B\u0101z\u0101r. The commonest boat is the saranga, a covered dug-out sometimes enlarged by side-planks, carrying up to 4 tons burden; the bal\u0101m carries up to 10 tons, and the gadu as much as 22 tons. Chittagong is connected with Calcutta and Rangoon by coasting steamers of the British Indian and Asiatic Steam Navigation Companies' lines. Two steamers ply to Cox's B\u0101z\u0101r, and one steamer runs weekly to R\u0101ng\u0101m\u0101ti in the Chittagong Hill Tracts.\n\nFor administrative purposes the District is divided into two subdivisions, with head-quarters at Chittagong and Cox's B\u0101z\u0101r. The District Magistrate is assisted by 13 stipendiaries, Administration. of whom 5 are employed as khas tahsild\u0101rs. Cox's B\u0101z\u0101r subdivision is in charge of a European Deputy-Magistrate. The District staff also includes an Inspector of schools, a Deputy-Conservator of forests, and an Executive Engineer.\n\nThe District and Sessions Judge is assisted in the disposal of civil work by two Subordinate Judges and sixteen Munsifs. The criminal courts include those of the Sessions Judge, the District Magistrate, and his assistants. The chief crimes are arson, forgery, perjury, fabrication of documents, and false personation.\n\nThe revenue history of this District, which is long and complicated, has been fully dealt with in the Settlement Report published in 1900; all that can be attempted here is to furnish an outline of the present position and to explain as briefly as possible how it arose. The District as a whole has never been permanently settled. The British occupation was almost immediately followed by the rough survey of 1764, the only\none of its kind made at that time in Bengal, and this embraced all the land then occupied. The total area measured was 609 square miles, of which 575 square miles were included in various estates, and 34 square miles belonged to the Jaynagar grant. When the Decennial Settlement was made in 1790, the measurement papers of 1764 were used as the basis of the assessment, and consequently nothing was permanently settled except the area of 575 square miles referred to above. According to the recent survey of 1898, these permanently settled estates comprise an area of 713 square miles, or two-sevenths of the District, the difference of 138 square miles being due mainly to under-measurement in 1764. The remaining five-sevenths are styled in local parlance *no\u0101h\u0101d*, or 'newly reclaimed land.' Of the permanently settled area of 575 square miles measured in 1764, about 417 square miles were included in revenue-paying estates, being assessed at 4-95 lakhs, and 158 square miles in revenue-free estates. Many of the latter were resumed and assessed to revenue in 1848, and the revenue-free area is now only 89 square miles, while the permanently settled revenue-paying estates measure 624 square miles and pay a revenue of 5-30 lakhs. The Jaynagar grant was conferred in 1763 subject to periodical remeasurement and reassessment; it escheated in 1796, because the proprietor set up an unfounded claim under a forged grant. In 1815 the Court of Sadr D\u012bw\u0101ni Ad\u0101lat held that the escheat was illegal, and ordered restitution, which was eventually made in 1848. The term of lease expired in 1902, and the revenue was then raised from Rs. 9,000 to Rs. 13,000 for an area of 38 square miles. The proprietors refused to accept the settlement, and the estate was taken under Government management; it was subsequently restored to them at the increased revenue, pending the decision of their claim that it is a permanently settled estate. An area of 751 square miles has now been accounted for; an additional area of 447 square miles was given out in 1848 under temporary leases. Part of this had been usurped by the proprietor of the Jaynagar grant under his forged grant prior to 1796; this was settled in 1848 direct with the persons in possession, who were styled *tallikd\u0101rs*. In the same year other state lands, which had been encroached upon by the proprietors of permanently settled estates and their tenants, were separated from the estates claiming them, and settled with the occupants for terms of either twenty-five or fifty years, and lands which had been reclaimed by squatters were similarly dealt with. The aggregate assessment on these two classes of estates was 2 lakhs. When the shorter leases fell in, the *t\u0101l\u016bks* concerned were resettled at enhanced rentals up to 1898, by which date the longer terms had also expired, and a general resettlement was effected on the basis of a regular survey and scientific assessment which had been\ncarried out during the previous six years. At the same time, all new reclamations were settled with the occupants. Excluding Jaynagar, the total area thus brought under settlement in 1898 was 515 square miles, which was assessed until 1925 at 6 lakhs. About 65 square miles have been sold under the Waste Lands rules for tea cultivation, and 2 square miles have been acquired by the Assam-Bengal Railway; the area not included in any of these categories is still at the disposal of the state.\n\nIt must not be supposed from this brief summary that each of the classes of estates is homogeneous or is clearly defined from the others. On the contrary, the fields of permanently settled estates and of taluks held under temporary leases are interlaced on the ground like squares on a chess-board, and the correct classification of each field according to the particular estate to which it belongs is a task of enormous difficulty. The temporarily settled estates number no less than 80,000; 34,500 are taluks, and the occupants have a right to resettlement in 1925 at such rents as Government may then fix; 500 are jirras or farms, which carry no such right; and 45,000 are ryot holdings pure and simple. All these temporary holdings are grouped with reference to locality into five Government estates, each of which is managed by an officer styled a kh\u0101s tahsil\u012br; their head-quarters are at Chittagong, Cox's B\u0101z\u0101r, S\u0101kari\u0101, Pati\u0101, and Raoj\u0101n, and their principal duty is the collection of the rents. The permanently settled estates number 28,636.\n\nThe total land revenue demand is equivalent to 35 per cent. of the gross rental of the District, and the incidence on each cultivated acre is Rs. 1-13-7, as compared with only R. 0-13-2 in Noakh\u0101li and R. 0-14-9 in Tippera. Rents are very high, partly because the land is fertile and the pressure of population on the cultivated area is great, and partly because of the large remittances made to the District by persons employed elsewhere. The average rates per acre vary for the different classes of tenants: ryots holding at fixed rates pay Rs. 4-4-0 per acre; settled ryots, Rs. 5-11-2; occupancy ryots, Rs. 4-10-6; non-occupancy ryots, Rs. 4-8-3; and under-ryots, Rs. 6-8-6.\n\nThe following table shows the collections of land revenue and total revenue (principal heads only), in thousands of rupees:\n\n|                | 1880-1 | 1890-1 | 1900-1 | 1903-4 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Land revenue   | 8,02   | 9,45   | 11,12  | 11,72  |\n| Total revenue  | 14,71  | 17,00  | 20,32  | 21,83  |\n\nOutside the municipalities of Chittagong and Cox's B\u0101z\u0101r, local affairs are managed by a District board, which expends about 2 lakhs annually, mainly derived from the road cess rates and from a con-\ntribution from Provincial revenues. In 1903-4 the income amounted to Rs. 1,96,000, of which Rs. 77,000 was derived from rates; and the expenditure was Rs. 1,83,000, including Rs. 85,000 on public works and Rs. 40,000 on education.\n\nThere are lighthouses at Kutubdi\u0101 and at Norman's Point. The Government embankment at Kutubdi\u0101, which was destroyed by the storm-wave of 1897, has been repaired; and a Government dike protects part of the coast-line.\n\nThe District contains 13 th\u0101nas or police stations and 20 outposts. The force under the District Superintendent numbers 3 inspectors, 36 sub-inspectors, 36 head constables, and 426 constables, in addition to a rural police of 2,446 chaukid\u0101rs and 215 daffad\u0101rs. The District jail at Chittagong has accommodation for 203 prisoners, and a subsidiary jail at Cox's B\u0101z\u0101r for 20.\n\nIn respect of education the District is very progressive. In 1901, 5.8 per cent. of the population (11.7 males and 0.5 females) could read and write. The total number of pupils under instruction increased from 46,184 in 1892-3 to 57,205 in 1900-1, while 57,844 boys and 7,723 girls were at school in 1903-4, being respectively 60.1 and 7.2 per cent. of those of school-going age. The percentage for boys was the highest in Bengal, and that for girls higher than elsewhere outside Calcutta. The total number of educational institutions, public and private, in 1903-4 was 1,987, consisting of one Arts college, 59 secondary schools, 1,138 primary schools, and 789 special schools. The expenditure on education was 1.9 lakhs, of which Rs. 40,000 was met from Provincial funds, Rs. 39,000 from District funds, Rs. 1,500 from municipal funds, and Rs. 90,000 from fees. The principal educational institution is the Arts college in Chittagong town.\n\nIn 1903 the District contained 13 dispensaries, of which 3 had accommodation for 60 in-patients. In all, 137,000 out-patients and 800 in-patients were treated during the year, and 4,000 operations were performed. The expenditure on medical institutions was Rs. 29,000, of which Rs. 10,000 was contributed by Government, Rs. 15,000 was derived from Local and Rs. 3,000 from municipal funds, and Rs. 8,000 from subscriptions.\n\nVaccination is compulsory only within municipal areas, but 62,000 persons, or 47 per 1,000 of the population, were vaccinated in 1903-4, compared with a ratio of 34 per 1,000 for Bengal.\n\n[Sir W.

The subdivision consists of a long strip of land between the sea and the hills, divided in the centre by the Sitakund hills, and bordered on the north and south by the ranges of Hill Tippera and the Chittagong Hill Tracts. The population in 1901 was 1,153,081, compared with 1,102,161 in 1891. It contains the head-quarters town of Chittagong (population, 22,140) and 1,217 villages. The density is 722 persons per square mile, compared with 223 in Cox's Bazar and 543 for the whole District. The only important place besides Chittagong is Sitakund.\n\nChittagong Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the Division and District of the same name in Eastern Bengal and Assam, situated in $22^\\circ 21'$ N. and $91^\\circ 50'$ E., on the right bank of the Karnaphuli river, 12 miles from its mouth. The population in 1901 was 22,140, of whom 13,513 were Muhammadans, 7,209 Hindus, 873 Christians, and 422 Buddhists. The history of the town has been narrated in the article on Chittagong District. It was constituted a municipality in 1864. The income during the decade ending 1901-2 averaged Rs. 58,000, and the expenditure Rs. 51,000. In 1903-4 the income was Rs. 69,000, including Rs. 20,000 derived from a tax on houses and lands, Rs. 12,000 from a conservancy rate, Rs. 4,000 from a tax on vehicles, and Rs. 4,000 from tolls, while Rs. 7,000 was received as fees from educational institutions. The incidence of taxation was Rs. 1-13-5 per head of the population. In the same year the expenditure was Rs. 55,000, the chief items being Rs. 1,000 spent on lighting, Rs. 15,000 on conservancy, Rs. 9,000 on medical relief, Rs. 6,000 on roads, and Rs. 8,000 on education. Water is supplied through pipes from a reserved tank to Bakshir H\u00e2t, the commercial quarter.\n\nChittagong was already an important place of trade in the sixteenth century, when the Portuguese merchants gave it the name of Porto Grando, and it is still the chief port in Eastern Bengal. The construction of the Assam-Bengal Railway has made it the natural outlet for the trade of Assam and part of Eastern Bengal. The chief business is the export of jute, which is baled at Narayanganj and either shipped thence by steamer to Chandpur and railed to Chittagong or dispatched direct in brigs to that port. Piece-goods, salt, and kerosene oil are imported, and rice, tea, and hides are the principal exports. The total value of the exports in 1903-4 was 316.7 lakhs, including jute (109.2 lakhs), tea (102.4 lakhs), and rice (23.6 lakhs). The value of the imports in the same year was 76.1 lakhs, including salt (2.3 lakhs), and machinery and railway plant (7.2 lakhs). A steamer jetty has been built, and a second is under construction. The town contains numerous public\nbuildings, including the church, a fine range of Government offices, the general hospital, and railway offices. The jail has accommodation for 203 prisoners. The Chittagong College teaches up to the F.A. standard of the Calcutta University, and in 1901 had 428 pupils on the rolls. There is also an important madrasa for Muhammadan students. Chittagong is the terminus of the Assam-Bengal Railway, and extensive workshops are situated at Pahartali, a suburb of the town. It is also the head-quarters of the Commissioner of the Division, of the Assam-Bengal Railway Volunteer Rifles, who number 276, and of a detachment of the Eastern Bengal Volunteer Rifles, including a mounted section.\n\nChittagong Hill Tracts.\u2014A frontier District in the Chittagong Division of Eastern Bengal and Assam, lying between $21^\\circ 11'$ and $23^\\circ 47'$ N. and $91^\\circ 41'$ and $92^\\circ 42'$ E., with an area of 5,138 square miles. It is bounded on the north by the State of Hill Tippera; on the west by Chittagong District; on the south by Arakan; and on the east by the Northern Arakan District of Burma and the Lushai Hills District of Assam.\n\nBetween the plains of Bengal and those of Upper Burma stretches a hilly tract of primaeval forest, bounded on the north by the State of Hill Tippera and by Assam, and on the south by the Burmese province of Arakan. A succession of hill ranges runs from north-west to south-east, determining the geographical and ethnical division of the whole country into three oblong strips, of which the most westerly is known as the Chittagong Hill Tracts; the central strip constitutes the Lushai Hills, and the eastern the Chin Hills, which form part of Upper Burma.\n\nThe general aspect of the District is a tangled mass of hill, ravine, and cliff, covered by dense tree, bush, and creeper jungle. The mountains are steep, and can only be ascended slowly and painfully along narrow zigzag paths through the jungle. The highest hills are Keokradang (4,034 feet) on the watershed of the Rankhiang river, and Pyramid hill (3,017 feet).\n\nThe principal rivers are the Fenny, Karnaphuli, Sangu, and Matamuhari. The Karnaphuli and Fenny flow transversely across the main lines of the hills and have no regular valleys; but the reverse is the case with the Sangu and Matamuhari rivers, which run parallel to the ranges, until they debouch in the plains, and also with the two main tributaries of the Karnaphuli, the Kaslang and Chingri, which do the same. These rivers are of great depth during the rains; but the rapidity and violence of their currents and their sharp turns and whirling eddies render them unnavigable by large craft within the limits of the District, and present considerable dangers to small boats. In addition to these rivers, there is a network of hill streams, on which\ncanoes alone are able to ply, and these only in parts. A mountain lake of great beauty is situated on the east of the R\u0101mak\u1e5bi Tang hill; it is about a mile long by a quarter of a mile broad, and is well stocked with fish.\n\nThe District has not been geologically explored, but so far as is known the rocks belong to the Upper Tertiary period.\n\nThe hills are covered with Laurineae, Dipterocarpeae, Ternstroemiaceae, Euphorbiaceae, and Leguminosae. A list of the principal trees will be found in the section on Forests. There are many kinds of bamboos, including Bambusa Tuld\u0101, vulgaris, arundinacea, and auriculata, as well as Melocanna bambusoides, Teinostachyum Dullooa, and others. Canes of various species, kurujpat (Licuala peltata), and a thatching-grass known as san (Imperata arundinacea) are common products. Orchids and ferns grow everywhere in great variety and profusion.\n\nThe forests afford an asylum to numerous wild animals, including elephants, tigers, leopards, both ordinary and clouded (Felis nebulosa), rhinoceros, bison, three kinds of bear\u2014the Himalayan black bear (Ursus torquatus), the sloth bear (Melursus ursinus), and the Malayan bear; and three kinds of deer\u2014the s\u0101mbar, chital, and barking-deer. The rivers swarm with fish, and excellent mahseer fishing is to be had in their upper reaches.\n\nThe climate is cool, but the valleys are unhealthy in September. The rainfall is very heavy, averaging 94 inches for the whole District. December and January are the only dry months; 19 inches fall between February and May, and an average of 18 inches monthly from June to August, while there are 11\u00bd inches in September, 6\u00bd inches in October, and nearly 2 inches in November.\n\nThe history of the Chittagong Hill Tracts is a record of constantly recurring raids on the part of the eastern hill tribes, and of the operations undertaken to repress them, of which a full narrative will be found in the article on the Lushai Hills. It will suffice to say here that the earliest mention of these raids is to be found in a letter from the Chief of Chittagong to Warren Hastings, the Governor-General, dated April 10, 1777, complaining of the violence and aggressions of a mountaineer named R\u0101mu Kh\u0101n, the leader of a band of K\u016bkis or Lushais; and that they continued without any long intermission down to 1891, when the Lushai Hills were annexed to British territory.\n\nThe recorded population increased from 69,607 in 1872 to 101,597 in 1881, to 107,286 in 1891, and to 124,762 in 1901. The Census of 1872 was, however, very imperfect, and the actual growth of population has probably not exceeded what might be expected in a sparsely inhabited but fairly healthy tract.\nThere is a large amount of insanity, and the proportion of persons mentally afflicted amounts to 1\u00b73 per 1,000 of the population.\n\nStatistics of the Census of 1901 are shown in the following table. There are no regular subdivisions, and the separate areas represent the circles or jurisdictions of the three chiefs, whose functions are described below under Administration:\n\n| Circle   | Area in square miles | Number of villages | Population | Population per square mile | Percentage of variation in population between 1891 and 1901 | Number of persons able to read and write |\n|----------|----------------------|--------------------|------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Chakm\u0101   | 2,421               | 94                 | 48,789     | 20                         | + 7\u00b71                                           | 3,390                                  |\n| Mong     | 653                 | 128                | 31,898     | 49                         | + 40\u00b74                                          | 597                                    |\n| Bomong   | 2,064               | 74                 | 44,075     | 21                         | + 12\u00b79                                          | 1,689                                  |\n| District total | 5,138          | 296                | 124,762    | 24                         | + 16\u00b73                                          | 5,576                                  |\n\nThere are no towns, and 211 of the villages have a population of less than 500, while that of only one exceeds 2,000. The head-quarters of the District are at R\u0101ng\u0101m\u0101\u1e6d\u012b. If the area of 1,385 square miles of uninhabited forest Reserves be deducted, the density is 33 persons per square mile. There is a little immigration from Chittagong, and a few persons have emigrated to Hill Tippera. The proportion of females to every 100 males is only 90 in the District-born, and 83 in the total population. Buddhists number 83,000, Hindus 36,000, and Musalmans 5,000. The Chakm\u0101s speak a corrupted Bengali; the Maghs, Arakanese, a dialect of Burmese; and the Tipperas a language of their own which is akin to K\u0101ch\u0101r\u012b.\n\nThe most important tribes are the Chakm\u0101s, who number 44,000; the Maghs, 35,000; and the Tipperas, 23,000: between them they account for nine-tenths of the population. The Chakm\u0101s are a Mongoloid race, probably of Arakanese origin, though they have intermarried largely with Bengalis. They are divided into three sub-tribes\u2014Chakm\u0101, Doingnak, and Tungjainya. The Doingnaks broke away from the main tribe a century ago and fled to Arakan; of late years some have returned to the Cox's B\u0101z\u0101r subdivision of Chittagong District. The Tungjainyas immigrated from Arakan as late as 1818, and spoke Arakanese until recently. Child-marriage is unknown, and divorce and remarriage of widows are permitted. The Chakm\u0101s occupy the central and northern portions, or rather less than half of the District; they burn their dead and offer invocations to spirits. The Maghs, as the Bengalis call the natives of Arakan, are found chiefly in the southern circle, under the sway of the Bomong chief; they are, for the most part, the descendants of Arakanese who fled hither when their own country was overrun by the Burmese in 1784. They are divided into three sections. The Jh\u016bmia, or cultivators of jh\u016bms, a term which will\nbe described later, regard themselves as the aborigines of the Hill Tracts, as contrasted with the Roang or Arakan Maghs, while the Barua or R\u0101jbansi Maghs have intermarried with Bengalis. It is the last-named group from which the well-known Magh cooks are recruited. The Tipperas, who are found chiefly in the Mong circle, are described in the article on the Hill Tippera State, which is their home. The Chakm\u0101s and Maghs are Buddhists, while the Tipperas are Hindus. No less than 66,000 persons with 43,000 dependants are engaged in nomadic agriculture, and 10,000 are plough cultivators.\n\nThere are only 252 Christians, of whom 248 are natives; the Baptist Missionary Society has a centre at R\u0101ng\u0101m\u0101ti, but the number of converts is very small.\n\nThe District consists largely of hills, which are unsuitable for plough cultivation, and the slopes cannot be terraced, as they are in the Himalayas, for want of stones for revetment. A great part of the total area is thus unsuitable for plough cultivation, and the only feasible method of tillage is that known as jhum, which is practised under different names all over India wherever the conditions are similar. In the months of January and February a convenient piece of forest land is selected; the bamboos are cleared and the smaller trees felled, but large trees are only denuded of their lower branches: the cut jungle is then allowed to dry in the sun, and in April it is fired. If it has thoroughly dried and no rain has fallen since the jhum was cut, this firing reduces all but the largest trees to ashes, and burns the soil to the depth of an inch or two. The ground is then cleared of charred logs and debris, and as soon as heavy rain falls and saturates the ground, the jhum is planted with mixed seeds of cotton, rice, melons, cucumber, pumpkins, yams, and maize. The method of sowing is very primitive; the seeds are mixed in a basket, and the sower makes a small hole in the ground with a dao or chopper and drops in the mixed seeds. The maize ripens about the middle of July; the melons, vegetables, and grain are harvested in September, and the cotton in October and November. This method of cultivation entails great labour and incessant care; the young plants have to be constantly weeded and guarded against the depredations of wild hog, deer, monkeys, and parrots. Moreover, the system is a very wasteful one, as the same jhum cannot be cultivated two years in succession, and the land takes from seven to ten years to recover. The out-turn is very uncertain, but from a successful jhum the returns are very large\u2014as much as three or four hundred-fold being occasionally obtained. Efforts are being made, with a fair measure of success, to induce the people to abandon jhuming in favour of plough cultivation, for which there is still plenty of suitable land lying waste in the valleys along the course of some of the larger rivers.\nRice is the staple crop; cotton is also grown for export; sesamum is important, and a little tea is cultivated. No agricultural statistics are available. Persistent efforts have been made by Government to encourage the hill-men to settle down to plough cultivation, wherever this is practicable; and that some success has been attained is shown by the fact that the rental of such lands has increased during the last six years from Rs. 10,000 to Rs. 16,000. The area under the plough now extends to nearly 14,500 acres; three-quarters of it grow rice and one-fifth mustard. The growth of cotton and til is also on the increase.\n\nIn addition to the 'unclassed' forests, the area of which amounts to 3,753 square miles, 'reserved' forests cover 1,385 square miles, or more than a quarter of the District. They are divided into five Reserves: namely, the K\u0101s\u0101lang (763 square miles), Rankhiang (215 square miles), Sit\u0101pah\u0101r (11 square miles), M\u0101tamuhari (251 square miles), and Sangu (145 square miles). The forests contain valuable timber and bamboos; the most useful trees are the j\u0101rul (Lagerstroemia Flos Reginae), t\u016bn (Cedrela Toona), gamh\u0101r (Gmelina arborea), ch\u0101pl\u0101s (Artocarpus Chaplasha), and gurjan (Dipterocarpus turbinatus). In 1903-4 the receipts of the Forest department amounted to Rs. 88,000.\n\nCotton cloth is woven by the hill-women for home consumption. Dug-outs are made and exported in considerable numbers to Chittagong and Noakh\u0101li, where they are shaped into sarangas, or built up into b\u0101l\u0101m boats. The timber generally selected is ch\u0101pl\u0101s or gamh\u0101r. The dimensions of these dug-outs vary from a small canoe, 18 feet long and 2\u00bd feet broad, to big sarangas, 60 feet by 8; and their price ranges from Rs. 10 to Rs. 700. Tea is manufactured on one estate, which yielded an out-turn of 19,000 lb. in 1903. Duos and axe-heads are made in the winter by immigrant blacksmiths from Monghyr and elsewhere.\n\nCotton is the principal article of export; 69,000 maunds were exported in 1903-4. Rice, sesamum seed, and a little mustard seed and tobacco form the remaining staples. There is a small import of piece-goods, rice, salt, tobacco, and dried fish. The trade is principally in the hands of Bengalis, and is carried on by water with Chittagong. The chief centres are at B\u0101ndarban, Chandraghon\u0101, Rankhiang, R\u0101ng\u0101m\u0101ti, Subalong, Barkal, Mah\u0101lchar\u012b, and Ajodhy\u0101.\n\nThe rivers are the principal means of communication, but the interior is being gradually opened up by roads. The District contains 230 miles of unmetalled roads, but these are only bridle-paths and are not passable for carts. The most important connect R\u0101ng\u0101m\u0101ti with Chittagong and with Dem\u0101giri in the Lushai Hills; the former is bridged throughout, but the latter is a fair-weather track only. Bridged\nbridle-paths are under construction from R\u0101ng\u0101m\u0101ti to Mah\u0101lchar\u012b, from B\u0101ndarban to Po\u0101ng\u2019s H\u0101t, and from B\u0101ndarban to Chandragh\u014dna. A Government steamer plies weekly on the Karnaphuli river from Chittagong to R\u0101ng\u0101m\u0101ti, a distance of 65 miles. A tramway has been constructed at Barkal to enable travellers to avoid the rapids in the Karnaphuli.\n\nThe Hill Tracts formed part of Chittagong District until 1860, when they were separated from Chittagong and placed under an officer called the Hill Superintendent. Seven years later his functions were enlarged, and he was styled the Deputy-Commissioner of the Hill Tracts. In 1891, after the annexation of the Lushai Hills, the tract lost much of its importance, and was reduced to the status of a subdivision in charge of an Assistant Commissioner immediately subordinate to the Divisional Commissioner. In 1900 it was again formed into a District by Regulation I of that year, and the old designation of Superintendent was restored to the officer in charge. The boundaries were revised, and a strip on the east, including Dem\u0101giri with a population of about 1,500, was transferred to the Lushai Hills. The District was at the same time divided into the Chakm\u0101, Mong, and Bomong circles, each of which was placed under the jurisdiction of its own chief, who was made responsible for the collection of the revenue and for regulating the internal affairs of his villages. The Chakm\u0101 circle occupies the centre and north of the District, the Bomong circle is in the south, and the Mong circle in the north-west. A headman is in charge of each village; he collects the revenue and receives a commission on his collections. The migration of ryots from one circle to another is discouraged as much as possible.\n\nThe ordinary codes of civil and criminal procedure are quite unsuited to the requirements of the primitive inhabitants of this remote tract, and the administration of justice is carried on in accordance with a few simple rules framed under Regulation I of 1900. Petty cases are dealt with by the village headmen and the three chiefs, subject to the general control and supervision of the Superintendent and his two assistants, who hear appeals from their orders and themselves try all important cases and suits; the Commissioner of the Division exercises the powers of a Sessions Judge and also of a High Court, except in the case of sentences of death, which require the confirmation of the Local Government.\n\nIn former times the only revenue obtained from the District consisted of a capitation or jhum tax, which in 1846\u20137 yielded Rs. 11,800. Since 1867 revenue has also been derived from the forests and from the lease of thatching-grass plots, and persons cultivating with the plough have been assessed on the area of their holdings in lieu of the old capitation\ntax; the only stamp revenue, however, is that obtained from the sale of postage stamps, and no income-tax is realized.\n\nThe capitation tax is now realized at the rate of Rs. 4 per family, of which Rs. 2 goes to the chief and Rs. 1 to the headman, and only Rs. 1 is taken by Government. The Government demand, however, is fixed for a term of years and is paid by the chief irrespective of the actual collections, which vary from year to year. The total revenue in 1903-4 was Rs. 1,28,000, including Rs. 87,000 from forests, Rs. 22,000 from land revenue, Rs. 9,000 from thatching-grass, Rs. 8,000 from the capitation tax, and Rs. 2,000 from stamps.\n\nLand revenue is assessed only on land cultivated with the plough. In order to encourage the people to take to this form of cultivation, all new holdings are given free for three years; the revenue is then fixed by the Superintendent, and may not be enhanced for ten years. The average rate of assessment is Rs. 1-8 per acre. The chief receives two annas and the headman three annas of every rupee of rental realized for plough cultivation, with the object of enlisting their co-operation in encouraging it.\n\nThe police force is under the direct control of the Superintendent. It consists of one inspector, 7 sub-inspectors, 17 head constables, and 113 constables, including a reserve of 3 sub-inspectors, 10 head constables, and 59 constables. There are in all 8 police stations. Prior to the annexation of the Lushai Hills, a much stronger body of police was maintained as a protection against raids; its strength in 1872 was 656. The present police are armed with Martini-Henri rifles. There is a lock-up at R\u0101ng\u0101m\u0101ti, in which persons sentenced to short terms of imprisonment are confined; other prisoners are sent to the jail at Chittagong.\n\nMale education is further advanced than might have been expected in such a remote tract, and the Census of 1901 showed that 4.5 per cent. of the population (7.9 males and 0.3 females) could read and write. The number of pupils in the schools increased from 721 in 1892-3 to 1,195 in 1900-1, while 1,574 boys and 115 girls were at school in 1903-4, being respectively 15.3 and 1.3 per cent. of those of school-going age. The number of educational institutions, public and private, in that year was 111: namely, 3 secondary, 81 primary, and 27 special schools. The expenditure on education was Rs. 20,000, of which Rs. 16,000 came from Provincial funds and Rs. 700 from fees.\n\nThe Hill Tracts contain 2 small police hospitals, one at R\u0101ng\u0101m\u0101ti and the other at Bandarban. Two charitable outdoor dispensaries were opened in 1902 at M\u0101nikcherrl and Mah\u0101lchari, and a third in 1904 at R\u0101ng\u0101m\u0101ti. During 1903 the cases of 6,000 out-patients were treated, and 122 operations were performed; the cost of maintenance, amounting to Rs. 2,000, was met by Government.\nVaccination has been compulsory since 1893. The great distances and bad communications are obstacles to progress, but 6,700 persons, or 54 per 1,000 of the inhabitants, were successfully vaccinated in 1903-4.\n\n[Capt. T. H.

It is the largest t\u0101luk in the District, having an area of 793 square miles; and it contains one town, Chittoor (population, 10,893), the head-quarters of the District, and 338 villages. The population in 1901 was 209,868, compared with 200,249 in 1891. The demand for land revenue and cesses in 1903-4 was Rs. 3,21,000. The t\u0101luk consists of an undulating plain, broken by a large number of naked rocky hills rising abruptly from the surrounding country and covered with enormous granite boulders. The soil is good and large areas are under irrigation, and the contrast between the vivid green of the patches of cultivation and the varied hues of the rocky eminences is most picturesque.**\n\n**Chittoor Town ('little town').\u2014Head-quarters of North Arcot District, Madras, and of the t\u0101luk of the same name, situated in 13\u00b0 13' N. and 79\u00b0 6' E., in the valley of the Poini river, on the South Indian Railway 18 miles north of K\u0101\u1e6dp\u0101di junction, and 100 miles by road from Madras. Population (1901), 10,893. Being 990 feet above the sea, during the winter months it is pleasantly cool; but in former years it suffered from more than one outbreak of virulent fever, and in consequence the head-quarters of some of the District staff were removed to Vellore. The place was a military station until 1874, but is now, except as the official centre, of no importance. It contains most of the usual courts and offices, and a Roman Catholic chapel.**\n\n**Chitt\u016br.\u2014Head-quarters of the t\u0101luk of the same name in Cochin State, Madras, situated in 10\u00b0 42' N. and 76\u00b0 45' E., on the Anaimalai river. Population (1901), 8,095, of whom 96 per cent. are Hindus, chiefly Br\u0101hmans and N\u0101yars. Several of the latter are substantial landholders. Cotton-weaving is carried on to some extent in the town. It contains a small palace, the offices of the tahsild\u0101r and the District Munsif, and a high school.**\n\n**Chob\u0101ri.\u2014Petty State in K\u0101\u1e6dh\u012b\u0101w\u0101r, Bombay.**\n\n**Chodavaram.\u2014Minor t\u0101luk in the Agency tract of God\u0101v\u0101ri District, Madras, lying between 17\u00b0 9' and 17\u00b0 52' N. and 81\u00b0 28' and\n81\u00b0 53' E., with an area of 715 square miles. It is bounded on the south and west by the Godavari river, and includes almost the whole of the Rampa hill country. The population in 1901 was 23,229. It contains 232 villages, Chodavaram being the head-quarters. The demand on account of land revenue and cesses in 1903-4 amounted to Rs. 7,400. The whole area is occupied by the Eastern Ghats, and forests cover nearly 575 square miles, of which 401 square miles belong to Government, but are not 'reserved,' the Forest Act not having been extended to this tract. In places the forests are very heavy, but it is impossible to exploit them owing to want of communications. There is only one metalled road, from Rajahmundry to Chodavaram. The forest products are timber, tamarinds, turmeric, oranges, wax, &c., which are brought by Malai traders to the markets at Chodavaram and Devipatnam. The chief crops are rice, pulses, ragi, combu, and maize, while a little tobacco is grown for local consumption. Graphite is met with in a few places, but not in paying quantities.\n\nChok.\u2014Petty State in KATHIWAR, Bombay.\n\nChola (Choda; in Asoka's inscriptions, Chora; the Chorai of Ptolemy, Chaliya of Hiuen Tsiang, and Sora of Pliny).\u2014One of the three ancient kingdoms which, according to tradition, originally divided the South of India. Its capital was at one time at Uraiyyur, now a suburb of Trichinopoly. Little definite is known of its rulers until the tenth century, when the capital was Tanjore, but the deciphering of the numerous inscriptions of the dynasty which survive is gradually clearing up their history from that time forward. Their expansion in the tenth and eleventh centuries is one of the great landmarks of South Indian history. They subverted both the Pallavas and the Pandayas and also the Eastern Chalukyas, with whom they subsequently maintained friendly relations for three generations by intermarriages, until eventually an Eastern Chalukya prince ascended the Chola throne about the close of the eleventh century. Rajaraja Deva, who came to the throne at the end of the tenth century, and was perhaps the greatest of their kings, seems to have ruled over almost all of what is now the Madras Presidency, as well as Mysore and Coorg. He had an organized army and a regular system of civil administration. He did much to beautify his capital city. It was about this time that a careful survey of the cultivable land in the Tamil country was conducted. His successors followed in his footsteps and expended their wealth in the construction of beautiful temples and useful irrigation works\u2014among the latter the Grand Anicut and several channels in the Tanjore delta. The dynasty declined towards the end of the twelfth century, falling before the Pandayas of Madura, the Hoysalas of Dorasamudra, and the Kakatiyas of Warangal, and was eventually overthrown by the Musalm\u0101n invasion of 1310.\nChola.\u2014Pass in the Chola range of the Eastern Himalayas, 14,500 feet above the sea, situated in $27^\\circ 25' N.$ and $88^\\circ 49' E.$, leading from Sikkim State to the Chumbi valley in Tibet.\n\nCholist\u0101n.\u2014Tahsil in Bah\u0101walpur State, Punjab. See NAHR S\u0100DIK\u012aVAR.\n\nChopda T\u0101luka.\u2014T\u0101luka of East Kh\u0101ndesh District, Bombay, lying between $21^\\circ 8'$ and $21^\\circ 25' N.$ and $75^\\circ 1'$ and $75^\\circ 34' E.$, with an area of 368 square miles. There are two towns, Chopda (population, 18,612), the head-quarters, and Ad\u0101vad (5,983); and 91 villages. The population in 1901 was 75,550, compared with 72,819 in 1891. The density, 205 persons per square mile, is much above the District average. The demand for land revenue in 1903\u20134 was 2\u00b73 lakhs, and for cesses Rs. 15,000. The t\u0101luka consists of two valleys, divided by a spur of the S\u0101tpur\u0101 range that runs across it obliquely from east to west. The southern valley is a part of the rich north T\u0101pti plain, and follows the course of that river. The northern or inner valley, known as the Dhauli taraf, is a broken and hilly country, unsurveyed, covered with dense forest, inhabited by Bhils, and infested by wild beasts. The T\u0101pti valley is fairly supplied with well water, but none of the streams is suited for irrigation. The chief rivers are the T\u0101pti, and its tributaries the Aner and Guli. The prevailing soil is a rich, black, alluvial clay, resting on a yellowish subsoil. The annual rainfall averages 25 inches.\n\nChopda Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the t\u0101luka of the same name in East Kh\u0101ndesh District, Bombay, situated in $21^\\circ 15' N.$ and $75^\\circ 18' E.$, 8 miles from the right bank of the T\u0101pti, 51 miles north-east of Dh\u016blia. Population (1901), 18,612. Chopda is probably a settlement of considerable antiquity, and its ruined fort shows that it was a place of much consequence under early Hindu rulers. In 1600 it was a large town and well peopled, with a temple of R\u0101meshwar, to which Hindus came from great distances. It was handed over by Sindhia in 1820, restored to him in 1837, and came again under British rule in 1844. There is a large trade in cotton and linseed. The municipality, which was established in 1870, had an average income during the decade ending 1901 of Rs. 10,000. In 1903\u20134 the income was Rs. 9,900. The town contains a dispensary, 5 cotton-ginning factories, 2 cotton-presses, and 6 schools with 456 pupils, one of which, with 30 pupils, is a girls\u2019 school.\n\nChor.\u2014Peak in Sirmur State, Punjab.

Chor\u0101s\u012b contains 2 towns, Surat (population, 119,306), the District head-quarters, and R\u0101nder (10,478); and\n65 villages. The population in 1901 was 169,100, compared with 159,170 in 1891. Owing to the inclusion of the city, the density is as high as 1,638 persons per square mile. Land revenue and cesses amounted in 1903-4 to 2.8 lakhs. The taluka forms a richly wooded plain, with highly cultivated fields enclosed with hedges. With the exception of the Tapti, which forms the northern boundary for about 18 miles, there is no river of importance, and the water-supply is defective, owing to the smallness of the village reservoirs and the brackishness of the well water.\n\nChota Nagpur Division.\u2014A Division of Bengal, lying between 21\u00b0 58' and 24\u00b0 49' N. and 83\u00b0 20' and 86\u00b0 54' E. The head-quarters of the Division are at Ranchi, and it includes five Districts, with area, population, and revenue as shown below:\n\n| District     | Area in square miles | Population, 1901 | Demand for land revenue and cesses, 1903-4, in thousands of rupees |\n|--------------|----------------------|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Hazaribagh   | 7,621                | 1,177,961        | 2,46                                                                |\n| Ranchi       | 7,128                | 1,187,925        | 1,65                                                                |\n| Palaman      | 4,914                | 619,600          | 1,71                                                                |\n| Manbhum      | 4,147                | 1,301,364        | 2,22                                                                |\n| Singhbhum    | 3,891                | 613,579          | 1,64                                                                |\n| **Total**    | **27,101**           | **4,900,419**    | **9,68**                                                            |\n\nNote.\u2014In the Report of the Census of 1901 the area of Singhbhum was shown as 3,753 square miles. The figure given above was supplied by the Surveyor-General.\n\nAfter the suppression of the Kol rebellion of 1831-2 this tract was exempted by Regulation XIII of 1833 from the operation of the general laws and regulations, and every branch of the administration was vested in an officer appointed by the supreme Government and styled the Agent to the Governor-General, South-West Frontier. In 1854 the designation of the province was changed to Chota Nagpur by Act XX of that year; and it has been administered since that date as a non-regulation province under the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal, the title of the chief executive officer being at the same time changed to Commissioner, and that of officers in charge of Districts to Deputy-Commissioner. The Commissioner exercises general control over the small Chota Nagpur States of Kharsawan and Saraikela.\n\nThe so-called Chota Nagpur plateau extends beyond the limits of the Division into the Tributary States of Chota Nagpur and Orissa on the south-west and south, and through the Santal Parganas to the Ganges on the north-east, while its outlying fringes stretch out into the south of the Patna and Bhagalpur Divisions on the north and into the west of the Burdwan Division on the east. The word 'plateau' is used, for\nwant of a better designation, for this tract of elevated country, and is not intended to imply that the area referred to forms an open table-land like that to the north of Cape Colony. There are three plateaux in the stricter acceptation of the term, one in R\u0101nch\u012b and two in Haz\u0101rib\u0101gh. Elsewhere the country is often very broken, and numerous ranges or groups of steep hills are intersected by deep ravines and occasionally by open valleys. The geological formation is gneiss, freely interbedded with micaceous, siliceous, and hornblendic schists, passing into transition or metamorphic rocks in West Bengal and South Bih\u0101r.\n\nThe recorded population increased from 3,147,699 in 1872 to 4,225,989 in 1881 and to 4,628,792 in 1891; but the earlier enumerations were defective. The density is 181 persons per square mile, compared with 438 for Bengal as a whole. In 1901 Hindus constituted 68\u00b75 per cent. of the total population, Muhammadans 5\u00b77 per cent., Christians (of whom all except 1,191 were natives) 2\u00b79 per cent., and Animists 22\u00b77 per cent., while among the remainder were 853 Jains. The Division is the home of numerous non-Aryan tribes, who were never properly subjugated either by the early Aryan invaders or by the Path\u0101n and Mughal emperors, or indeed by any outside power until the advent of the British. They have thus preserved in their mountain fastnesses an individuality in respect of tribal organization, religion, and language which their congeners in the plains have long since lost. They are gradually abandoning their tribal dialects in favour of the nearest Aryan form of speech, Hindi to the north and west, Oriy\u0101 to the south, and Bengali to the east; but a large number still speak their own languages, which are divided by philologists into two great families, the Mund\u0101 and the Dravidian. This distinction, however, is merely an indication of some earlier political condition, and does not represent any corresponding divergence of physical type. The most distinctive of the tribes represented are the Sant\u0101ls (see SANT\u0100L PARGANAS) in Haz\u0101rib\u0101gh, M\u0101nbh\u016bm, and Singhbh\u016bm, the MUND\u0100S in R\u0101nch\u012b, the ORAONS in R\u0101nch\u012b and the Tributary States, the HOS in Singhbh\u016bm, the BHUM\u012aS in M\u0101nbh\u016bm and Singhbh\u016bm, and the Gonds in the Tributary States. A remarkable increase in the number of Christians took place during the decade ending 1901, due principally to new conversions in R\u0101nch\u012b, where Christians numbered 124,958, compared with only 75,693 ten years previously. The German Lutheran missionaries have here met with great success; and the District is also a great centre of Roman Catholic missionary enterprise, containing three-fifths of the total number of their converts in Bengal.\n\nThe Division contains 13 towns and 23,876 villages. R\u0101nch\u012b (25,970) is the only town with a population exceeding 20,000 inhabitants. Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur possesses great mineral wealth, especially in respect of coal, the principal fields being the Girid\u012bh coal-field in\nHaz\u0101rib\u0101gh, the Jherri\u0101 coal-field chiefly in M\u0101nbh\u016bm, and the Daltonganj coal-field in P\u0101l\u0101mau. The output of coal and coke in 1903 was 3,329,000 tons. Mica is mined in Haz\u0101rib\u0101gh, and 547 tons were produced in 1903. The Jain temples at Parasn\u0101th Hill yearly attract thousands of pilgrims; other interesting antiquities are the ruins of a fort at P\u0101nchet and of temples at several places in the M\u0101nbh\u016bm District.\n\nChot\u0101 N\u0101gpur States.\u2014A term formerly applied to nine Native States in Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur, Bengal, consisting of the seven Tributary States of Ch\u0101ng Bhak\u0101r, Kore\u0101, Surgug\u0101, Udaipur, Ja\u015bhpur, G\u0101ngpur, and Bonai, and the two Feudatory States of Khars\u0101w\u0101n and Saraikel\u0101. The five States first named were transferred in October, 1905, to the Central Provinces, as part of the territorial redistribution connected with the formation of the new Province of Eastern Bengal and Assam, and the Oriy\u0101-speaking States of G\u0101ngpur and Bonai were at the same time attached to the Orissa Tributary States. The Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur States therefore now include only the two small States of Khars\u0101w\u0101n and Saraikel\u0101. These States, which lie between 22\u00b0 29' and 22\u00b0 54' N. and 85\u00b0 38' and 86\u00b0 0' E., have a total area of 602 square miles, and are practically wedged in between the Districts of M\u0101nbh\u016bm and Singhbh\u016bm. They are bounded on the north by the Districts of R\u0101nchi and M\u0101nbh\u016bm; on the east and west by Singhbh\u016bm; and on the south by the Orissa State of May\u016brbhanj and Singhbh\u016bm.\n\nChot\u0101 Sinchul\u0101.\u2014Peak in the Sinchul\u0101 range, in the Alipur subdivision of Jalpaiguri District, Eastern Bengal and Assam, situated in 26\u00b0 48' N. and 89\u00b0 34' E., about 7 miles north of Buxa cantonment and separating British from Bhutan territory. The elevation is 5,695 feet above sea-level.\n\nChota Udaipur.\u2014State in the Political Agency of Rew\u0101 K\u0101nth\u0101, Bombay, lying between 22\u00b0 2' and 22\u00b0 32' N. and 73\u00b0 47' and 74\u00b0 20' E., with an estimated area of 873 square miles. It is bounded on the north by the State of B\u0101riya; on the east by Ali R\u0101jpur; on the south by petty States in the Sankheda Mehw\u0101s; and on the west by Baroda territory. The river Orsing runs through the State, dividing it into two nearly equal portions; the Narbad\u0101 washes its southern boundary for a few miles. The country is hilly and overgrown with forest. During the greater part of the year the climate is damp and unhealthy, and fever is prevalent.\n\nThe family of the chief are Chauh\u0101n R\u0101jputs, who, when driven out of their former territories by the advance of the Musalm\u0101ns about the year 1244, entered Gujar\u0101t, and took possession of Ch\u0101mp\u0101ner city and fort. On the capture of Ch\u0101mp\u0101ner in 1484 by Mahm\u016bd Begara, they withdrew to the wild parts of their former possessions east of Ch\u0101mp\u0101ner, one branch founding the State of B\u0101riya and the other the State\nof Chota Udaipur. In the disturbances of 1858 the chief refused to hold any communication with T\u0101nti\u0101 Topi, one of the leaders of the rebellion, and prepared to defend himself against any attempt to enter his capital. It was when encamped before the town of Chota Udaipur that T\u0101nti\u0101 Topi was defeated by General Parke. The chief bears the title of M\u0101h\u0101r\u0101wal. His house follows the rule of primogeniture, and holds a sanad of adoption. He is entitled to a salute of nine guns. The family moved at one time to Mohan, a most advantageous position for commanding the passes, and built a fort there. Hence the State is sometimes called Mohan. But this capital was abandoned in favour of Chota Udaipur. It was probably in consequence of the defenceless position of the latter place that the chiefs became tributary to the Gaikw\u0101r. The political control has since 1832 been transferred to the British Government.\n\nThe Census of 1901 returned a population of 64,621, or 74 persons per square mile, living in one town (Chota Udaipur) and 502 villages. Hindus numbered 63,516 and Musalm\u0101ns 1,965. During the last decade the State lost 31 per cent. of its population owing to famine. Of 297 square miles of cultivable area, 77 square miles were cropped in 1903\u20134. Cotton occupied about 11\u00bd square miles and sesamum 6\u00bd square miles. About 225 square miles of the total area are covered by forest. There are no manufactures or mines; but marble and iron exist in the soil, and expert advice is being obtained with a view to their exploitation. The principal exports are timber, cotton, and flowers of the mahua tree. The main route from M\u0101lw\u0101 to Baroda and the sea passes through the territory.\n\nThe R\u0101j\u0101 is a chief of the second class, and has power to try his own subjects for capital offences. The income of the State in 1903\u20134 was about 2 lakhs. A tribute of Rs. 8,908 is payable to the Gaikw\u0101r of Baroda, the amount being collected by the British Government. The chief maintains a police force of 257 men, and a mounted military corps of 25 men, who act as a bodyguard. There is one jail. The State contains 14 schools with an average daily attendance of 456 pupils, and one dispensary which treated 4,473 patients in 1903\u20134. In the same year 2,733 persons were vaccinated.\n\nChotila.\u2014Petty State in K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r, Bombay.\n\nChowbe J\u0101girs.\u2014Collection of estates in the Baghelkhand Agency, Central India. See Chaube J\u0101girs.\n\nChowgh\u0101t (Chaugh\u0101t).\u2014Town in the Ponn\u0101ni t\u0101luk of Malabar District, Madras, situated in 10\u00b0 35' N. and 76\u00b0 2' E. Population (1901), 7,426. It was formerly the head-quarters of a t\u0101luk of the same name, which was amalgamated in 1860 with Kutn\u0101d and Betatn\u0101d into the present t\u0101luk of Ponn\u0101ni. It contains a District Munsif's court and a deputy-tahsild\u0101r's office. At Palay\u016br to the east\nthere is a Romo-Syrian church, noted as one of the seven original churches of Malabar. The town lies on a backwater, connected by canals with Ponnani on the north and Travancore on the south.\n\n**Chu\u0101d\u0101nga Subdivision.**\u2014Eastern subdivision of Nadi\u0101 District, Bengal, lying between 23\u00b0 22' and 23\u00b0 50' N. and 88\u00b0 38' and 89\u00b0 1' E., with an area of 437 square miles. The subdivision consists of a flat widespread plain intersected by numerous streams, which have now in many instances silted up. The population increased from 245,422 in 1891 to 254,589 in 1901, the density being 583 persons per square mile. The subdivision contains 485 villages, Chu\u0101d\u0101nga being its head-quarters.\n\n**Chu\u0101d\u0101nga Village.**\u2014Head-quarters of the subdivision of the same name in Nadi\u0101 District, Bengal, situated in 23\u00b0 39' N. and 88\u00b0 51' E., on the left bank of the M\u0101t\u0101bh\u0101nga river. Population (1901), 3,147. Chu\u0101d\u0101nga is a station on the Eastern Bengal State Railway, and an important trade centre. It contains the usual public offices; the sub-jail has accommodation for twelve prisoners.\n\n**Chuda State.**\u2014State in the K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r Political Agency, Bombay, lying between 22\u00b0 23' and 22\u00b0 30' N. and 71\u00b0 37' and 71\u00b0 51' E., with an area of 78 square miles. The population in 1901 was 12,005, residing in one town and 13 villages. The revenue in 1903-4 amounted to 1.2 lakhs, and 39 square miles were cultivated. Chuda ranks as a third-class State in K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r. It is an offshoot from Wadhwan. The ruler first entered into engagement with the British Government in 1807. He bears the title of Th\u0101kur.\n\n**Chuda Town.**\u2014Chief town of the State of the same name in K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r, Bombay, situated in 22\u00b0 29' N. and 71\u00b0 44' E. Population (1901), 5,581. It is a railway station on the Bhavnagar-Wadhwan line.\n\n**Chudesar.**\u2014Petty State in Rew\u0101 K\u0101nth\u0101, Bombay.\n\n**Chumalhari.**\u2014Snow peak on the boundary between Tibet and the north-western corner of the State of Bhut\u0101n, situated in 27\u00b0 50' N. and 89\u00b0 16' E., 23,933 feet above sea-level. Chumalhari is known as one of the most sacred mountains in Tibet.\n\n**Chumbul.**\u2014River in Central India. See Chambal.\n\n**Chumurchi.**\u2014Village in the south-west of the State of Bhut\u0101n, situated in 26\u00b0 55' N. and 89\u00b0 7' E.\n\n**Chun\u0101r Tahsil.**\u2014Tahsil of Mirzapur District, United Provinces, comprising the parganas of Bhagwat, Kary\u0101t Sikhar, Ahraur\u0101, Chun\u0101r, Bhulli, and t\u0101luka Saktesgarh of pargana Kantit, and lying between 24\u00b0 47' and 25\u00b0 15' N. and 82\u00b0 42' and 83\u00b0 12' E., with an area of 562 square miles. Population fell from 185,582 in 1891 to 176,532 in 1901. There are 580 villages and two towns: Ahraur\u0101 (population, 11,328) and Chun\u0101r (9,926), the tahsil head-quarters. The demand for land revenue in 1903-4 was Rs. 2,87,000, and for cesses Rs. 45,000.\nThe density of population, 314 persons per square mile, is considerably above the District average. The Ganges divides the pargana of Kary\u0101t Sikhar on the north from the rest of the tahsil, which stretches away south to the middle of the Vindhyan plateau. In the west the scarp of the Vindhyas reaches almost to the Ganges, and scattered hills are found on the bank of that river; but in the east lies a broader stretch of level land. The Jirgo rises in the south of the tahsil, and flows north to join the great river near Chun\u0101r. The area under cultivation in 1903-4 was 242 square miles, of which 36 were irrigated. Wells supply more than half the irrigated area, and tanks most of the remainder.\n\nChun\u0101r Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the tahsil of the same name in Mirzapur District, United Provinces, situated in 25\u00b0 7' N. and 82\u00b0 54' E., on the right bank of the Ganges and on the East Indian Railway. Population (1901), 9,926. Tradition assigns a high antiquity to the fort of Chun\u0101r. Bhartrin\u0101th, brother of the half-historic Vikram\u0101ditya of Ujjain, is said to have chosen this solitary wooded rock overhanging the Ganges as the site of his hermitage. In the early Muhammadan period a Hindu, named Prithwi R\u0101j\u0101, possessed the fortress, and after his death it was seized by the Musalm\u0101ns. A mutilated slab over the gateway, however, commemorates its recovery from the invaders. It again fell into the hands of the Muhammadans, though the actual command of the fort remained in the hands of the Baheli\u0101s till it became British. Sher Kh\u0101n, S\u016br, afterwards Sher Sh\u0101h, obtained Chun\u0101r by marriage with the daughter of a local chief; and in the struggles between Path\u0101n and Mughal the fort was of great importance as the key to Bengal and Bih\u0101r. It was captured by Hum\u0101y\u016bn in 1537, and recaptured shortly after by Sher Sh\u0101h. In 1575 Akbar's armies took the place, which remained in the power of the Mughals till the eighteenth century, when it fell into the hands of the Naw\u0101b of Oudh. The British troops under Major Munro attacked it without success in 1763; but it came into our possession after the battle of Buxar in the following year. After R\u0101j\u0101 Chet Singh's outbreak in 1781, Warren Hastings retired to Chun\u0101r, where a force was collected under Major Popham, which expelled Chet Singh from his strongholds in the neighbourhood. Hastings was fond of the situation and climate of Chun\u0101r, and his residence is still standing. The fort was used for some time as a place of confinement for state prisoners, and was garrisoned up to 1890. The Provincial reformatory for juvenile offenders in the United Provinces is now located here.\n\nThe fort is built on an outlier of the Vindhyan range, a sandstone rock jutting into the Ganges and deflecting the river to the north. It lies nearly north and south, 800 yards long, 133 to 300 broad, and 80 to 175 feet above the level of the surrounding country. The circum-\nference of the walls is about 2,400 yards. The present fortifications were for the most part constructed by the Musalmans, apparently from materials obtained by pulling down still older Hindu buildings. The town lies immediately north of the fort in the angle between the Jirgo and the Ganges, and contains a dispensary and a branch of the Church Missionary Society. Close by is the tomb of Shah Kasim Sulaimani, a saint whose piety was clearly established, when he was carried prisoner to Delhi, by his fetters dropping off each evening at the time of prayer. His cap and turban are still shown at his tomb, and when gently rubbed by one of his disciples pour out a divine influence.\n\nChunar was a municipality from 1868 to 1904, and during the ten years ending 1901 the income and expenditure averaged about Rs. 7,000. The income in 1903-4 was Rs. 13,000, chiefly derived from octroi (Rs. 8,000); and the expenditure was Rs. 12,000. Its constitution has now been changed to that of a 'notified area.' The town has little trade, but some inferior art pottery with debased European patterns is produced here. There is a tahsil school, and the municipality aids three schools attended by 246 pupils.\n\n[Cunningham, Archaeological Survey Reports, vol. xi, p. 128.]\n\nChunderi.\u2014Town in Gwalior State, Central India.

It extends from the Sutlej right across the Manjha, including a narrow strip of country beyond the Ravi. The lowlands are irrigated by the Upper Sutlej Inundation Canals, and the Manjha portion by the Bari Doab Canal. The population in 1901 was 257,281, compared with 230,197 in 1891. The head-quarters are at the town of Chuni\u00e1n (population, 8,959); and it also contains the town of Khudian (3,401) and 430 villages. The land revenue and cesses amounted in 1903-4 to Rs. 3,25,000.\n\nChuni\u00e1n Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the tahsil of the same name in Lahore District, Punjab, situated in 30\u00b0 58' N. and 74\u00b0 0' E., 8 miles from Changa Manga on the North-Western Railway. Population (1901), 8,959. The town stands on the high bank of the old bed of the Beas. It is the local centre through which the grain and cotton of the tahsil pass to the railway. The municipality was created in 1867. The income during the ten years ending 1902-3 averaged Rs. 15,200, and the expenditure Rs. 16,300. The income for 1903-4 was Rs. 15,600, derived mainly from octroi; and the expenditure was Rs. 21,300. Chuni\u00e1n has little trade, and the only industry of any importance is cotton ginning. There are 8 ginning factories, 6 of which in 1904 gave employment to 259 persons. The town possesses an Anglo-veracular middle school and a dispensary.\nChupra.\u2014Subdivision and town in Saran District, Bengal. See Ch\u0101pra.\n\nChurni.\u2014River of Bengal. See Mat\u0101bh\u0101nga.\n\nChuru.\u2014Head-quarters of the tahsil of the same name in the Reni niz\u0101mat of the State of Bikaner, R\u0101jput\u0101na, situated in $28^\\circ 18' N.$ and $74^\\circ 59' E.$, about 100 miles east of Bikaner city, and close to the Shekhawati frontier. The town is said to have been founded by and named after a J\u0101t called Chuhru, about 1620. Population (1901), 15,657. Churu is the home of many wealthy bankers, and contains some fine houses, wells, and akh\u0101tris (cenotaphs). The fort is said to have been built in 1739. The town possesses a combined post and telegraph office, a vernacular school attended by 76 boys, and an excellent hospital. The latter was the gift of a munificent citizen named Bhagw\u0101n D\u0101s, and contains accommodation for 15 in-patients.\n\nThe town and fort of Churu, with about 80 villages in the neighbourhood, were formerly held by an influential Th\u0101kur, who was constantly contending with the Darb\u0101r. In 1813 the Th\u0101kur was besieged in his fort, and, being reduced to great straits, is said to have swallowed a diamond and died. Churu fell into the hands of the Darb\u0101r, but was shortly after recovered by the Th\u0101kur's successor with the help of Am\u012br Kh\u0101n. In 1818 the Darb\u0101r, assisted by a British force, finally took possession, and the Th\u0101kurs of Churu now hold only five villages.\n\nChuti\u0101.\u2014Village in the head-quarters subdivision of R\u0101nchi District, Bengal, situated in $23^\\circ 21' N.$ and $85^\\circ 21' E.$, 2 miles east of R\u0101nchi town. Population (1901), 888. Chuti\u0101 was at one time the seat of the N\u0101gbansi R\u0101j\u0101s, and this circumstance gave to their territory the designation of Chot\u0101 (a corruption of Chuti\u0101) N\u0101gpur.\n\nChuti\u0101 N\u0101gpur.\u2014Division and group of Native States in Bengal.

See Chhatarpur.\n\nCirc\u0101rs, Northern (Sark\u0101r = a division of land).\u2014A name applied to the five northern Districts of the Madras Presidency\u2014Ganj\u0101m, Vizagapatam, God\u0101vari, Kistna, and Gunt\u016br. It dates from the Musalman occupation of this part of the country. There were then five Circ\u0101rs: namely, Gunt\u016br, Kondapalli, Ellore, R\u0101jahmundry, and Chicacole. Chicacole included the present Ganj\u0101m and Vizagapatam Districts; R\u0101jahmundry extended to Cocan\u0101da; and Kondapalli came as far south as the Kistna river. The chief town of the five Circ\u0101rs was Masulipatam.\n\nIn 1750 Muzaffar Jang, on becoming S\u016bbahd\u0101r of the Deccan by the help of the French, ceded to them Masulipatam, with the adjacent country. In 1753 his successor, Sal\u0101bat Jang, extended the grant to\nthe whole of the Northern Circars. M. Bussy, who was appointed to the government of the new tract, united the whole, though not without great trouble in Chicacole, Bobbili, and other places, under the titular chiefship of Viziarama R\u0101z, R\u0101j\u0101 of Vizianagram. He was succeeded by Ananda R\u0101z, who, after making offers in vain to the Madras Government (then embarrassed by the French besieging their capital), surrendered the Circars to the English in Bengal. Lord Clive at once sent an army southwards, which, after defeating the French, stormed Masulipatam. A treaty was concluded with Sal\u0101bat Jang, by which all the territory dependent on Masulipatam, about 80 miles in length and 20 in breadth, was ceded to the English. In 1761 Niz\u0101m Ali supplanted Sal\u0101bat Jang; and in the following year four of the Circars were offered by him to the East India Company on condition of affording military aid. The offer was refused; but in 1765 the Company obtained a grant of all the five Circars from the emperor, Sh\u0101h Alam. To secure possession of them the fort of Kondapalli was seized, and a treaty of alliance signed with Niz\u0101m Ali at Hyder\u0101b\u0101d, November 12, 1766. By this treaty the Company, in consideration of the grant of the Circars, engaged to maintain troops at an annual cost of \u00a390,000 for the Niz\u0101m's assistance whenever required. Gunt\u016br, being a personal estate of the Niz\u0101m's brother, Bas\u0101lat Jang, was, as a matter of courtesy, excepted during his lifetime. Two years later another treaty was signed (on March 1, 1768), in which the Niz\u0101m acknowledged the validity of Sh\u0101h Alam's grant and resigned the Circars (Gunt\u016br again excepted) to the Company, receiving, as a mark of friendship, \u00a350,000 per annum. In 1769 the Circars were taken under direct management; and in 1778 Gunt\u016br was also rented, by special treaty, from Bas\u0101lat Jang for his lifetime. The Niz\u0101m strongly objected to this lease and the Madras Government eventually cancelled it. Bas\u0101lat Jang died in 1782; but though Gunt\u016br should then have been at once handed over, it was not until 1788 that it came under British administration. In 1823 the claims of the Niz\u0101m over the Northern Circars were determined by a money payment from the Company of 116\u00bd lakhs, and the whole thus became a British possession.\n\nCis-Sutlej States.\u2014A group of States in the Punjab, lying in the tract of country bounded by the Sutlej on the west and north, the Siw\u0101lliks on the north-east, the Jumna on the east, and the old Delhi territory on the south. In 1809 the treaty between the British Government and Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101 Ranjit Singh of Lahore set a limit to the encroachments of the Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101 to the east and south of the Sutlej, and the Cis-Sutlej States were formally taken under British protection. These States were mostly held by Sikh chiefs, of whom the most prominent was the R\u0101j\u0101 of Pati\u0101la with a revenue of a quarter of a million sterling; and by bands of Sikh horsemen, whose individual\nshares in some cases did not exceed the twentieth part of a single village. Many of them were of recent origin, and had been founded by Sikh warriors from beyond the Sutlej after the overthrow of the Afghan governor at Sirhind by the united forces of the Sikhs on both sides of the river in 1763. For some time previous to the treaty of 1809 Ranjit Singh had aimed at establishing his supremacy over the cis-Sutlej territory. Several of the most prominent of the chiefs had been tributaries of the Maratha power, and it was as the successor of the Marathas that the British Government claimed the protectorate. The protected chiefs were allowed full sovereignty within their respective territories, but were required to assist the British with all their forces in repelling any invasion of the country. The British Government confined its interference with the States to the settlement of quarrels, and the determination of disputes as to succession, but reserved to itself, as the price of its protection, the right of escheat in case of failure of heirs.\n\nPolitical control over the States was until 1840 exercised through the British representative at Delhi and his assistants, who were also responsible for the administration of the territories which lapsed from time to time in default of heirs. In 1840 a Governor-General's Agent for the North-West Frontier was appointed with his head-quarters at Ambala, and two years later the administration of the lapsed territories was transferred to him.\n\nIn the first Sikh War (1845-6) the great majority of the States failed to act up to their obligations. The Lahore army was largely recruited in their territories, and their sympathies, as a rule, were with the enemies of their protectors. As a consequence, at the end of 1846, important modifications were made in the relations between the defaulting States and the paramount power. The most flagrant offenders were punished by confiscation, and the remainder were deprived of their police jurisdiction, and of the right to levy customs and transit duties, while the obligation to furnish troops was commuted for a money payment. Nine chiefs only\u2014those of Patiala, Nabha, Jind, Maler Kotla, Faridkot, Kalsia, Raikot, Dyalgarh, and Mamdot\u2014were exempted from this arrangement, and allowed to retain full powers.\n\nThese reforms added largely to the territory under the direct control of the British Government. The head-quarters of the Agent had been transferred to Lahore, and a Commissioner of the Cis-Sutlej States was appointed, subordinate to him. It was speedily found that, without police jurisdiction, the position of the States was an impossible one; and in 1849, after the conquest of the Punjab, the British Government assumed complete control throughout their territories, which were shortly afterwards brought under settlement, and the revenues assessed in cash. The position of the chiefs, and of the representatives of the old communities of horsemen (known as patildars), who were thus\ndeprived of their former powers, became that of ordinary jagirdars; and the right of succession to the jagirs is confined to the descendants in the male line of the persons actually in possession in 1809, the date of the declaration of the British protectorate. Of the States which were allowed to retain powers in 1846, Di\u0101lgarh lapsed in 1852 and Raikot in 1854, while Mamdot was annexed in 1855 in consequence of the misconduct of the Naw\u0101b. The defunct States are now incorporated in the Districts of Amb\u0101la, Karn\u0101l, Ludhi\u0101na, Ferozepore, and Hiss\u0101r.\n\nClosepet.\u2014Head-quarters of the sub-t\u0101luk of the same name in the Channapatna t\u0101luk of Bangal\u014dre District, Mysore, situated in 12\u00b0 43' N. and 77\u00b0 17' E., on the Ark\u0101vati, 28 miles by rail from Bangalore city. Population (1901), 6,099. The town was founded in 1800, being named after Sir Barry Close, the Resident, and became the head-quarters of the B\u0101rg\u012br or irregular horse at that time. The Musalm\u0101ns of the place are largely engaged in the rearing of silkworms and reeling of silk. The municipality dates from 1870. The receipts and expenditure during the ten years ending 1901 averaged Rs. 3,000. In 1903\u20134 they were Rs. 3,800.\n\nCocan\u0101da Subdivision.\u2014Subdivision of God\u0101vari District, Madras, consisting of the t\u0101luk of Cocan\u0101da and the samand\u0101ri tahsil's of Tuni and Pith\u0101puram.\n\nCocan\u0101da T\u0101luk.\u2014Coast t\u0101luk in God\u0101vari District, Madras, lying between 16\u00b0 43' and 17\u00b0 6' N. and 82\u00b0 8' and 82\u00b0 21' E., with an area of 294 square miles. The population in 1901 was 213,758, compared with 183,505 in 1891. It contains two towns, Cocan\u0101da (population, 48,096), the District and t\u0101luk head-quarters, and S\u0101makot (16,015); and 99 villages. The demand on account of land revenue and cesses in 1903\u20134 amounted to Rs. 5,45,000. Coringa and Injaram, well-known seaports in the days of the early European settlements, are situated in this t\u0101luk; and Tallarevu, near Coringa, is the only place in the District where ship-building is now carried on. The principal crop is rice, which is irrigated by canals from the God\u0101vari river.\n\nCocan\u0101da Town (K\u0101kina\u1e0da).\u2014Town and seaport in the t\u0101luk of the same name, God\u0101vari District, Madras, situated in 16\u00b0 57' N. and 82\u00b0 14' E., at the head of Cocan\u0101da Bay, which is formed by the shoals at the mouth of the eastern branch of the God\u0101vari river. A branch 10 miles long connects the port with the main line of the East Coast Railway at S\u0101makot junction (391 miles from Madras). The population in 1901 was 48,096, of whom 44,787 were Hindus, 2,281 Muhammadans, and 1,022 Christians.\n\nCocan\u0101da is of little historical importance. Jagann\u0101thapuram, one of its suburbs, was however very early chosen by the Dutch as the site\nof a factory. It was finally ceded to the British in 1825. After the capture of Masulipatam by Colonel Forde in 1759, the French twice landed a small force at Cocanada, but were easily repulsed. With the silting up of Coringa Bay Cocanada took the place of Coringa as a port, and rose into importance during the American Civil War as a place of shipment for the cotton pressed at Guntur.\n\nThe town is situated on a sandy plain, little above sea-level. Two canals from Dowlashweram, one running through Samalkot and the other through the Ramachandrapuram taluk, fall into the tidal creek on which it stands and connect it with the waterways of the District. It is the head-quarters of the District administration, though some of the staff are stationed at Rajahmundry, and one of the two District Forest officers at Kunavaram. It is also the head-quarters of a company of the East Coast Rifle Volunteers. The Canadian Baptist Mission have their principal establishment here, and there is a Roman Catholic church and convent.\n\nCocanada was constituted a municipality in 1866. The municipal receipts during the ten years ending 1902-3 averaged Rs. 91,000, and the expenditure (including the water-works) Rs. 1,01,000. The income in 1903-4 was Rs. 1,14,000, the principal sources being the taxes on houses and lands (Rs. 27,500), and tolls (Rs. 13,000). The expenditure was Rs. 1,39,000, the chief items being water-works (Rs. 57,000), conservancy (Rs. 19,400), and roads and buildings (Rs. 20,500). There are two hospitals, one, the Victoria Memorial Hospital, which was opened in 1903, being for women. The water-works, completed in 1903 at a cost of 4\u00bd lakhs, are designed to give a supply of 10 gallons per head per day to a population of 40,000. The water is obtained from the Samalkot canal.\n\nCocanada is the chief port on the Coromandel coast north of Madras; but since the construction of the railway, and also on account of the silting up of the bay, it has much declined. Vessels calling here anchor 4\u00bd miles from the entrance to the harbour off the Vakalapudi lighthouse in 5 fathoms at low water. In 1903-4, 265 vessels with a tonnage of 534,545 entered the port and 265 also cleared from it. Of the latter, 38 with a tonnage of 61,611 cleared for foreign ports. The value of the foreign exports was about 84 lakhs, and of the imports 19 lakhs. The coasting trade was valued at about 103 lakhs. The chief exports are cotton, shipped to the United Kingdom, France, and Belgium; oilseeds, chiefly to France and the United Kingdom; and rice, to Ceylon and Mauritius. Tobacco is sent in large quantities to Rangoon, where it is made up into cheroots. Ghi, pulses, and castor and gingelly oils are also exported. The principal imports are cotton piece-goods and twist and yarn, which come coastwise from Bombay, gunny-bags from Bengal, rice from Burma, and kerosene oil from\nAmerica. Cocan\u0101da possesses a Chamber of Commerce and a Port Conservancy Board. The port dues in 1903-4 amounted to Rs. 37,000, and landing and shipping dues to Rs. 20,000. During the year 1903, 23,400 passengers embarked at the port, all for Burma.\n\nA private salt factory is worked at Cocan\u0101da, and important Government salt-pans are situated a few miles off at Penugud\u016bru. A large rice-husking mill has been opened, and several small husking and oil factories are at work. There are also an iron foundry and some small cheroot-making firms. But the principal business of the place is the shipping trade.\n\nThe chief educational institution in Cocan\u0101da is the Pith\u0101puram R\u0101ja's College, founded in 1852, and endowed in 1865 with Rs. 25,000 by the R\u0101ja of that estate. It was raised to a second-grade college in 1884, and has an attendance of 490, of whom 54 are in the college classes. The Timpany Memorial school, founded in 1883 for English-speaking children, and under the management of the Canadian Baptist Mission, has an attendance of 40.\n\nCochin State (Kochchi).\u2014Native State in political relations with the Government of Madras, called after the town of the same name, formerly its capital but now a British possession. It lies between $9^\\circ 48'$ and $10^\\circ 49'$ N. and $76^\\circ$ and $76^\\circ 55'$ E., and has an area of 1,361$\\frac{1}{2}$ square miles. The State is singularly diversified in its configuration and physical aspects. It consists of two disconnected parts, the larger of which is bounded on the north by the Malabar District of Madras, on the east by Malabar and Travancore State, on the south by Travancore, and on the west by Malabar and the Arabian Sea. The smaller part, called Chittur, is situated to the north-east, and is entirely surrounded by the Madras Districts of Malabar and Coimbatore. There are also a few small isolated tracts encircled by Travancore.\n\nThe State is divided into three well-defined parts\u2014the hills, the plains, and the seaboard. The hilly or eastern portion, which covers nearly half its total extent, is formed by a section of the Western Gh\u0101ts and is broken by long spurs, extensive ravines, dense forests, and tangled jungles, rising terrace after terrace to an elevation of 5,000 feet above the sea. It is covered with magnificent forests of teak and other valuable trees, and exhibits everywhere a splendid luxuriance of foliage and flowers. Stretching westward, in gentler slopes and gradually widening valleys, but broken here and there by isolated low hills, the plains succeed the forest-clad uplands. Intersected by numerous rivers and streams, dotted everywhere with homesteads or farms, and closely cultivated wherever possible, these plains stretch in a succession of gentle undulations towards a line of backwaters on the coast. Between\nthe backwaters and the sea is a long and narrow stretch of sand, densely covered with luxuriant coco-nut palms, and in some parts, where there are natural or artificial embankments, with a wide extent of rice-fields. It is low and generally swampy, and is in several parts liable to be flooded during the monsoon inundations.\n\nThe chief rivers are the Alwaye, the Ch\u0101lakudi, the Kurum\u0101li or Karuvann\u016br, the Ponn\u0101ni, and the Anaimalai. The Alwaye is really a Travancore river, but runs through Cochin for a few miles; and along this part of its course there are several neat bungalows on its banks, for the use of the members of the ruling family and the chief officers of the State. The Ch\u0101lakudi rises in the Kodasseri forests and, after a tortuous course of nearly 70 miles, empties itself into the backwater a few miles from Cr\u0101ngan\u016br. The Kurum\u0101li, which is known as the Karuvann\u016br after its junction with the Manali, drains the Paravatt\u0101ni and P\u0101lapilli forests. The Ponn\u0101ni receives numerous streams rising from the Cochin forests, and forms for several miles the boundary between Malabar and Cochin. The Anaimalai or Chitt\u016br river, in its course through Coimbatore and Malabar, meanders along 15 miles of Cochin territory in a broad bed of rock and sand.\n\nOne of the most striking physical features of the country is the continuous chain of lagoons or backwaters already mentioned, which run parallel to the sea and receive the drainage of the numerous streams descending from the Western Gh\u0101ts. They are very irregular in form, varying in breadth from 4 miles to a few dozen yards, and branch out into a number of intricate and shallow channels, sometimes containing low alluvial islands. They communicate with the sea at three points\u2014Cochin, Cr\u0101ngan\u016br, and Chetwai. Though they are shallow in most places, navigation along them is at all times possible for flat-bottomed passenger and cargo boats. There are also two extensive fresh-water lakes, which are connected with each other, the Enam\u0101kkal and the Manakkodi. A part of the former lies within Malabar District. These lakes open into the backwaters at Enam\u0101kkal and Chirakkal, and embankments are constructed to prevent the ingress of salt water from these during the hot season, when the beds of the lakes are sown with rice. The area thus annually cultivated exceeds 7,000 acres.\n\nThe prevailing geological formation of the eastern part of the State is gneiss, which decomposes into a soil eminently suited, in combination with the heavy rainfall, to support a luxuriant forest growth. Proceeding westwards, the formation merges into a laterite underlain by gneiss, and becomes sandy on the seaboard.\n\nThe flora of the hilly part of the State resembles that of the rest of the Western Gh\u0101ts, consisting chiefly of plants that love a warm and moist climate. The principal trees are referred to under Forests below.\nCoffee and cardamoms are grown on the Nelliampathis. The more prominent growth of the laterite plains includes numerous jack- and mango-trees, areca palms, and various species of plantain. The coconut palm is the chief tree on the seaboard.\n\nThe forests of Cochin contain all the larger animals of Southern India. Elephants and bison (gaur) are common in the Parambikolam range and to a less extent in the Kodasseri range. Nilgiri ibex are occasionally seen in the higher ranges of the Nelliampathis. Tigers, bears, leopards, hyenas, sambar and other kinds of deer are met with in all the forests. The hunting leopard and the wolf are said to be found in some of the jungles. Monkeys and birds of species uncommon away from the west coast are found both in the hills and on the plains. The rivers and backwaters contain otters and crocodiles.\n\nThe climate, though damp and enervating, is not unhealthy. It is most moist in the southern taluks, which are situated close to the sea and the backwaters, but less so in the north. Of all parts of the State, the Chittur taluk, situated within the Palghat Gap, has the driest and most bracing climate. The lower hills and parts of Chittur are feverish, especially during the dry months. Elephantiasis is very common along the coast. The temperature is fairly uniform throughout the year; the highest figure recorded in 1903 was 96\u00b0 in April, and the lowest 69\u00b0 in December, the mean being 82\u00b0.\n\nThe rainfall is very heavy, and is fairly regular and uniform in quantity. Like the west coast generally, Cochin gets the benefit of both the monsoons in full. In Chittur, however, owing to its situation within the gap, the supply is less copious, and this accounts for its drier climate. The annual rainfall, based on the statistics for the twelve years ending 1903, averaged 136 inches at Trichur, 108 at Ernakulam, and 66 at Tattamangalam. The State has not for several generations suffered from any serious natural calamities, such as destructive floods or earthquakes, and famine is practically unknown.\n\nTill about the middle of the ninth century A.D. Cochin formed part of the kingdom of Kerala. About that time, Cheraman Perumal, the last ruler, according to tradition, of the vast country stretching from Gokarn in the north to Cape Comorin in the south, resigned the kingdom into the hands of his relatives and friends, embraced Islam, and went on a pilgrimage to Arabia, where his tomb is reported to have been found. The present Rajas of Cochin claim to hold their territory in direct descent from him. Nothing is known of the subsequent history of the State till the advent of the Portuguese, except that there was constant strife between its rulers and the neighbouring chiefs, especially the Zamorin of Calicut. In 1502 the Portuguese were allowed to settle in the town of Cochin, and in the following year they built a fort and established commercial relations\nwith the surrounding country. In the wars with the Zamorin, they rendered effective aid to the Rajas of Cochin. In 1599 Menezes, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Goa, convened a synod at Udayamperur (the Diamper of history), a village about 12 miles to the southeast of Cochin, at which the tenets of the Syrian Christians, then a large body, were declared heretical, and all their service-books were corrected in order to rid them of Nestorian phrases. In 1663 the Dutch ousted the Portuguese from the town of Cochin. They also obtained possession of several villages on the coast by friendly negotiation with the Raja, but otherwise left the latter to reign supreme. About a century later, in 1759, when the Dutch power began to decline, the Zamorin of Calicut invaded the State, but was expelled with the aid of the Raja of Travancore, who obtained a portion of Cochin as a reward for this service. In 1776 Haidar Ali, the Muhammadan usurper of Mysore, invaded the State, and the Raja agreed to acknowledge his suzerainty and pay tribute. The State remained tributary to him and to his son and successor Tipu till 1791, when the Raja entered into a treaty with the British by which he became their vassal and agreed to pay a tribute of a lakh of rupees. In 1808 Paliyath Achan, the hereditary chief minister of the State, entered into a conspiracy with the minister of Travancore to assassinate the Resident, and raised an insurrection against the British power without the knowledge of the Raja. This was easily suppressed; and a fresh treaty was concluded which imposed an enhanced tribute of about 2\u00bd lakhs. The Raja also engaged to hold no correspondence with any foreign State and to admit no Europeans into his service without the sanction of the British Government, who might dismantle or garrison any fortresses in his dominions. On the other hand, the British undertook to defend the territories of the Raja against all enemies. In 1818 the tribute was reduced to 2 lakhs, which has since remained unaltered. The subsequent history of the State is one of internal reforms and increasing prosperity. In 1862 the Raja received from Earl Canning, then Governor-General of India, a sanad granting him the right of adoption on failure of natural heirs. As in the adjoining State of Travancore, succession is through the female line, according to the prevalent usage on the west coast. His Highness Sir Rama Varma, the present Raja, succeeded in 1895. He was created K.C.S.I. in 1897 and G.C.S.I. in 1903. He is entitled to a salute of 17 guns.\n\nPrehistoric dolmens or burial cairns are found here and there, especially in the upland tracts, as also are rock-cut caves, the chief of which are those of Tiruvilwamala and Trikuri. The remains of the Dutch fort at Cranganur, of the lines erected by Travancore and Cochin to stop the advance of Tipu, and of the fort round the town of Trichur still exist. There are several old temples, of which the most noteworthy\nare the Vadakunnathan shrine in Trichur and the Tiruvanchikulam temple near Cranganur. The Jewish synagogues at Mattancheri, with a clock-tower nearly 300 years old, the copperplate charters of the Jews, and some old Christian churches are of archaeological interest. But few old inscriptions have been found, and they possess little historical value.\n\nThere are 659 towns and villages in the State. The population was 601,114 in 1875, 600,278 in 1881, 722,906 in 1891, and 812,025 in 1901. The decline in 1881 was due merely to different enumeration. The State is divided into the seven taluks of Kanayannur, Cochin, Cranganur, Mukundapuram, Trichur, Talapilli, and Chittur, the respective head-quarters of which are Ernakulam (the capital of the State), Mattancheri, Cranganur, Irinjalakuda, Trichur, Vadakkancheri, and Chittur. Other noteworthy towns are Kunnamkulam and Tattamangalam.\n\nStatistics of population, according to the Census of 1901, are appended:\n\n| Taluk       | Area in square miles | Number of Towns | Villages | Population | Population per square mile | Percentage of increase in population between 1891 and 1901 | Number of persons able to read and write |\n|-------------|----------------------|-----------------|----------|------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Kanayannur  | 81                   | 1               | 83       | 114,628    | 1,419                     | + 12-3                                                   | 10,935                                 |\n| Cochin      | 63                   | 1               | 61       | 120,456    | 1,919                     | + 14-1                                                   | 18,445                                 |\n| Cranganur   | 19                   | ...             | 7        | 29,140     | 1,554                     | + 4-2                                                    | 3,633                                  |\n| Mukundapuram| 418                  | 1               | 139      | 161,833    | 3,87                      | + 11-1                                                   | 16,108                                 |\n| Trichur     | 225                  | 1               | 174      | 145,104    | 645                       | + 12-5                                                   | 23,384                                 |\n| Talapilli   | 271                  | 1               | 163      | 153,315    | 588                       | + 13-0                                                   | 18,600                                 |\n| Chittur     | 285                  | 2               | 25       | 89,549     | 314                       | + 13-6                                                   | 8,894                                  |\n| **Total**   | **1,362**            | **7**           | **652**  | **812,025**| **6,826**                 | **+ 12-3**                                               | **108,979**                            |\n\nNearly 69 per cent. of the people are Hindus or Animists, 7 per cent. Musalmans, and more than 24 per cent. Christians. Jews number 1,137. The population increased at the rate of 12-3 per cent. during the last decade, and the density now is as high as 596 persons per square mile. Malayalam is the language of 88 per cent. of the population and Tamil of nearly 7 per cent. In the Chittur taluk, which adjoins Coimbatore, as many as 36 per cent. of the people speak Tamil.\n\nThough the most numerous caste in the State is the toddy-drawing Iluvans or Tiyan, who number 184,504, the most characteristic and important caste is the Nayars, who number 111,837. They formed the militia of the country in olden times, but are now chiefly agriculturists and Government servants. They follow the Marumakkattayam law of inheritance, i.e. succession through the sister's children, and among\nthem marriage is not a legal but only a social compact dissolvable at the will of either party. Among other castes who follow the same law are the Kshattriyas or the ruling class (892), the Ambalav\u0101s\u012bs or temple-servants (7,483), and low-caste S\u016bdras, such as barbers, washermen, and weavers (7,521). The Br\u0101hmans of this coast, called Namb\u016bdris (6,407), are a very conservative people who retain, more than any other class of Br\u0101hmans, the old-world piety and purity of the priestly class. Among them the eldest sons alone marry in their own class, the other sons forming alliances with N\u0101yar and Ambalav\u0101si women. Other castes include the artisans (29,809), the V\u0101lans (7,564), and Arayans (4,081), who are fishermen and boatmen; the Velans (8,243), who are washermen to low castes; and the agricultural labourer Cherumans (59,840), Paraiyans (8,841), Vettuvans (6,349), and Kanakans (5,917). The hill tribes include 215 N\u0101y\u0101dis, 2,631 Malayans, 439 Ulladans, and 310 K\u0101dans. The chief occupation of the people is agriculture, and as many as 49 per cent. of them (excluding coco-nut growers) live by the land. The next most considerable occupations are those connected with the coco-nut, such as oil-pressing and rope- and mat-making, and with the backwaters, such as catching and curing fish, rowing boats, and so on, by which 16\u00b76 per cent. of the people are supported.\n\nThe economic condition of the people has improved considerably during the last thirty years. Wages of unskilled labourers have risen during this period from 2\u00bd to 4 annas in towns and from 2 to 3 annas in villages, while those of skilled labourers have risen from 4\u00bd to 8 annas in towns and from 3\u00bd to 6 annas in villages. The prices of food-stuffs have also risen, however. The price of husked rice, the chief food-grain, was Rs. 2\u00be per maund in the early seventies, while it is now nearly Rs. 4. The poorest class of agricultural labourers, the former predial serfs, still receive their wages in kind at the old rates; but on the whole the people, especially the urban population, are now much better off than were their fathers thirty years ago. They live in better houses, are better clothed, and enjoy more comforts in everyday life.\n\nBirths and deaths have been registered since 1896. The statistics are collected by the village officers and submitted at the end of each month to the taluk office, where they are consolidated. As there is no law in the State which renders it obligatory on the part of householders to report the births and deaths occurring in their families, the statistics cannot be considered exhaustive or reliable. The number of births and deaths registered in 1903 was only 8\u00b75 and 9\u00b76 per 1,000 respectively of the population.\n\nOf the 198,239 Christians in the State (1901), 196,690 are natives. Of these, 77,818 are Roman Catholics under the Archbishop of Verapoli (Varapuzha) and the Bishops of Cochin and Coimbatore, 90,142 Romo-Syrians under the Bishops of Trichur and Ernakulam, 8,884\nChaldean Syrians under the Patriarch of Babylon, 17,408 Jacobite Syrians under a Metropolitan owing allegiance to the Patriarch of Antioch, 514 St. Thomas or Reformed Syrians under the supreme control of a local Metropolitan, and 1,924 Protestants of various denominations.\n\nThe history of the Catholic and Syrian Churches in Cochin would fill many pages and is beyond the scope of the present article. There were Christians on the west coast in Marco Polo's time, in the thirteenth century. The Protestant missions started work in Cochin but recently. The Church Missionary Society began operations first at Trichur in 1842 and at Kunnamkulam in 1854, the Church of England Zanana Mission at Trichur in 1881, and the Leipzig Lutheran Mission at Chittur in 1882.\n\nAt the foot of the Ghats and in the Chittur taluk, the chief underlying rock is gneiss of a micaceous or hornblendic variety, loam derived from which is chemically very favourable for cultivation. In the middle zone of the State, the soil is a lateritic clayey loam, the laterite being derived from a quartzose variety of the gneiss. In the tracts near the backwaters and the sea, the earth consists of recent deposits of sand and mud, due mostly to river alluvium. These two latter varieties are of moderate fertility.\n\nCultivation is almost entirely rain-fed, the monsoon rains being both regular and abundant. It derives material help, however, in the Chittur taluk from the irrigation works on the Anaimalai river, and elsewhere from temporary dams across smaller streams. Rice, of which some 50 varieties are locally distinguished, forms the staple of cultivation. Two crops of this are generally raised on all the low ground and one on land on a higher level, while a third crop is raised on some of the best land fed by irrigation from wells or minor streams temporarily dammed. The 'dry crops' are the usual cereals and pulses, plantains and other vegetables, betel-leaf and areca-nut, tapioca, sugar-cane, ginger, and pepper. These are neither extensive nor important. Next to rice, coco-nut growing engages the chief attention of the cultivators. The tree is largely raised in the sandy tracts, and its products form the chief exports of the State. Coffee is grown on the Nelliampathis, the area under it being 3,182 acres. The total extent under 'wet' cultivation is 137,000 acres. Statistics of the area of 'dry' lands are not available. No noteworthy improvements have been made in agricultural practice in recent years.\n\nThere is no indigenous breed of cattle or sheep. Milch cows are imported from Coimbatore, and draught bullocks from Mysore. Their degenerate progeny and crosses, supplemented by buffaloes, which seem to be better adapted to the climate, supply the plough cattle.\nSheep of the *semmuri* breed are imported from Coimbatore, and a puny variety of goats is bred here and there.\n\nPermanent irrigation works exist only in the Chittur *t\u0101luk*, where two anicuts have been constructed by the State and four by the ryots. In the other *t\u0101luk*s, small areas are irrigated by temporary dams put up annually across the minor streams. There are 169 such dams or *chiras*, of which 48 are made by the ryots. The total area under irrigation is 17,000 acres, or 12 per cent. of the 'wet' area. Of this, the State canals supply 5,000 acres and the State dams 6,200, while the rest is watered by private works, chiefly canals. A sum of Rs. 17,000 is annually collected as irrigation cess.\n\nThe forests of Cochin form one of its most valuable assets. As they have not yet been fully surveyed and demarcated, their exact extent is unknown. The approximate area is 605 square miles, or nearly half of the State. Till recently, the importance of forest administration on scientific principles was not sufficiently recognized, and the reckless destruction of the forests by timber-cutters, cultivators, and firewood-gatherers went on to a great extent unchecked. But a better system of administration was inaugurated about 1898, with the result that, while many parts of the forests are now enjoying a long-needed rest, the revenue from this source is increasing enormously.\n\nThe department is under the control of a Conservator. The whole forest area is divided into two charges, called the northern and southern divisions, each under an Assistant Conservator. The former is composed of the Mach\u0101d and Chittur ranges, and the latter of the Kodasseri and Parambikolam ranges. The major portion of the forests in the northern division were overworked in former years; and these parts are now practically left alone, except for the removal of badly grown and stunted teak-trees, the extraction of fuel under the system of coppice with standard fellings, and selection fellings in the parts which have not been previously overworked. Teak, ebony (*Diospyros Ebenum*), and black-wood (*Dalbergia latifolia*) grow in all these ranges, but they are neither abundant nor of superior quality. Among exploitable trees that grow fairly in these forests are ir\u016bl (*Xylia dolabriformis*), aini (*Artocarpus hirsuta*), vedankorana (*Bignonia xylocarpa*), vengai (*Pterocarpus Marsupium*), and pongu (*Calophyllum bracteatum*). It is, however, in the southern division that teak and other valuable trees flourish generously and abundantly. The Parambikolam range, including the Neiliampathis, and the Kodasseri range, containing the Adarapalli forests, are densely covered with magnificent timber of marketable value. Several teak-trees have recently been felled in the former, of which the largest (but by no means the largest in the range) contained more than 400 cubic feet of wood. They are practically virgin forests, covering an area of about 300 square miles, and have never before\nbeen worked for want of a suitable outlet. From the Adampalli forests timber can be transported through Travancore with comparative facility, but no exit is possible through Cochin territory except at prohibitive cost. From the Parambikolam range an outlet has, after careful investigation, been made in the shape of a tramway and timber slide, at a cost of 10 lakhs. The tramway is in three sections. The first section covers a distance of 20\u00bd miles in the higher range, and is followed by a self-acting inclined tramway 5,000 feet long. Then comes the second section, 4\u00bd miles in length, at the end of which timber is sent down by means of a slide 7,000 feet long, whence it is taken over the third section, 19 miles in length, to the Chalakudi railway-station.\n\nAmong the minor forest products are cardamoms, which grow in several parts of Kodasseri and Parambikolam, lemon-grass, honey, beeswax, &c., which are found in all the forests. Elephants are caught in pits: 28 were so caught in the three years ending 1904. The only attempt at artificial reproduction as yet made is the teak plantation at P\u0101lapilli in the Kodasseri range, which is about 800 acres in extent. The people are allowed to remove from the forests, free of all charge, head-loads of fuel, bamboos, and thorns for fencing, leaves for manure, timber for agricultural implements, fodder, and thatching-grass. The free grazing of cattle, sheep, and goats is also allowed. The receipts from the forests in 1903\u20134 amounted to Rs. 5,84,000, compared with only Rs. 58,100 in 1880\u20131.\n\nThe only minerals worked in the State are granite, laterite, and limestone. The first two are quarried, chiefly for building purposes, in all the t\u0101lukas but Cochin, Crangan\u016br, and Chitt\u016br. Limestone is extracted in Chitt\u016br in small quantities. There are traces of iron and mica in some parts, but they have not yet been exploited.\n\nCotton-weaving is carried on to some extent in the Chitt\u016br and Talapilli t\u0101lukas. Laced and other cloths of fine texture are made out of English cotton twist, and are displacing the Tinn\u00e9velly cloths so much affected by the people of this coast. Grass mats of excellent colouring and texture, made at Vadakkancheri, are in much demand. Coir (coco-nut fibre) matting and rugs of good quality are made at Ernakulam and Mattancheri.\n\nThe most important factory industry is the extraction of coco-nut oil. Seven steam mills, all in the Cochin t\u0101luk and owned by native capitalists, in which about 400 hands are employed daily, are engaged in this manufacture. The out-turn in 1903 was about 16,000 tons of oil, worth over 60 lakhs. Besides some concerns for the manufacture of ordinary pottery and pantiles, there are two tile factories at Trich\u016br and two in the Mukundapuram t\u0101luk, where tiles and bricks of the\nMangalore pattern are made. A steam saw-mill is at work at Vypin and another near Shoranur. There is also a hydraulic press at Mattancheri for pressing coir yarn.\n\nThe chief exports are coco-nut oil, yarn, rope, fibre and matting made from coir, copra, areca-nut, ginger, pepper, fish and prawns; and the chief imports are rice, cotton piece-goods and twist, raw cotton, metals, hardware and cutlery, and sugar. No official statistics of trade are available; but figures for the value of the chief exports and imports through British Cochin, which are mainly the exports and imports of the Cochin State, show that the annual exports of coco-nut oil are worth 93 lakhs; of yarn, &c., made of coir, 50 lakhs; and of pepper, 9 lakhs; while the imports include grain valued at 38 lakhs, and raw and manufactured cotton valued at 11 lakhs.\n\nA branch line of railway on the metre gauge was opened in June, 1902, from Shoranur, on the south-west line of the Madras Railway, to Ernakulam, the capital of the State. The line, which is 65 miles long and cost nearly 70 lakhs of rupees, is owned by the State, but is worked by the Madras Railway Company.\n\nThe total length of metalled roads maintained in Cochin is 391 miles, and of unmetalled roads 56 miles. All the towns and important villages in the State, except those on the seaboard, are connected by good roads, which also meet all the metalled roads in Malabar and Travancore that touch the Cochin frontier. Before the introduction of the railway, the chief means of communication, especially for goods, was the backwaters, which still attract a considerable portion of the local traffic. The length of this line of communication from Trichur to the southern end of the State is 60 miles, and the canals which branch out from it have an aggregate length of about 60 miles.\n\nThe State has a postal system or anchal of its own. There are in all 39 post offices, or one to every 35 square miles, besides 56 letter-boxes. Postage stamps of the values of 3 pies and of $\\frac{1}{2}$, 1, and 2 puttans (1 puttan = 10 pies), stamped envelopes of similar denominations, and post-cards and reply-cards of the values of 2 and 4 pies are manufactured by the State under the supervision of the Superintendent of Stamps and Stationery.\n\nThe State has hitherto had the good fortune to enjoy immunity from famine. During the great famines of 1876-8 and 1897-8, there was considerable scarcity, but it was not so acute as to necessitate relief works, much less gratuitous relief.\n\nCochin is divided for administrative purposes into two divisions, the northern and southern, the head-quarters of which are at Trichur and Ernakulam. The administrative head of the division is the Peshkar, who is also the District Magistrate, and whose position corresponds to that of the Collector of a British\nDistrict. The northern division comprises the taluks of Trichur, Talapilli, and Chittur, and the southern division those of Kanayannur, Cochin, Cranganur, and Mukundapuram, each of which is in charge of a tahsildar, who is also a second-class magistrate. There are three stationary sub-magistrates\u2014at Nemmara, Kunnamkulam, and Adur. The taluks are further subdivided into forty-four pravertis or amsams. The D\u012bw\u0101n is the chief minister and responsible head of the administration.\n\nThe principal sources of revenue and the amounts received from each in 1903-4 were: land revenue, 7 lakhs; salt, 5 lakhs; forests, 6 lakhs; judicial items, 3 lakhs; and excise, 2 lakhs. The chief items of expenditure were: forests, 5 lakhs; palace, 3\u00bd lakhs; public works, 2\u00bd lakhs; law and justice, 2\u00bd lakhs; and the tribute to the British Government, 2 lakhs. Of the expenditure under 'palace,' a sum of Rs. 2,40,000 represents the fixed allowances to the R\u0101j\u0101 and the members of his family. The balance is a fluctuating item, being the miscellaneous expenditure in connexion with the palaces. The total receipts amounted to 29 lakhs and the total expenditure to 28\u00b79 lakhs, compared with 14\u00b75 lakhs and 13\u00b73 lakhs respectively in 1880-1. The receipts and expenditure of the Cranganur taluk are not included in these figures. That tract is a separate principality, under a chief who pays a tribute of Rs. 6,857 to Cochin. It is financially autonomous, but is in all other respects treated as an integral part of the State.\n\nThe only coins ever minted in the State were the single and double puttans, which were of the value of 10 and 20 pies respectively. The earliest coinage of these of which we have any record was that of 1783-4, when two lakhs of rupees' worth of them were made. Puttans to the value of Rs. 36,000, Rs. 62,000, Rs. 32,000, and Rs. 30,000 were coined in 1790, 1821, 1855, and 1897 respectively. Subsequently the coin began to depreciate in value, so much so that in 1900 the State felt constrained to withdraw all the puttans from circulation and abolish the coin as legal tender. The State has now no currency of its own, but all British Indian coins are current.\n\nBy the Interportal Convention of 1865, the State agreed to abolish the tobacco monopoly and the system of inland transit duties, to equalize the rates of customs duties at its seaports with those obtaining at the ports of British India, and to sell salt within its limits at the price ruling in the District of Malabar. In return for these concessions, the British Government guaranteed to the State a minimum customs and tobacco revenue of Rs. 1,10,500. The excise revenue is derived from the sale of the monopoly to manufacture and sell country spirits, and the revenue from opium and ganja from the sale of the monopoly to vend these drugs, which are obtained by the contractor from the Madras store.\nhouses. Tobacco can be imported and sold by licence-holders, and the licence fees paid by them constitute the tobacco revenue.\n\nCivil justice is administered by six Munsifs' courts, two District courts, and a Chief Court. The Munsifs try all suits of which the value does not exceed Rs. 1,000 and to which the State is not a party. The District courts hear appeals from the decisions of the Munsifs and try all suits to which the State is a party or of which the value exceeds Rs. 1,000. Appeals from their decisions are heard by the Chief Court, whose decision in civil cases is final. This tribunal consists of three Judges, of whom one is a European barrister. Criminal jurisdiction is exercised by the Chief Court, two Sessions courts, two District Magistrates with first-class powers, and ten second or third-class magistrates. The Chief Court is the highest appellate court, but sentences of death or of imprisonment for life are subject to confirmation by the R\u0101j\u0101. The Sessions courts have the same powers as the corresponding tribunals in British territory. The District Magistrates have power to pass sentences of imprisonment for one year and fines up to Rs. 500; the second-class magistrates, sentences of six months' imprisonment and fines up to Rs. 200; and the third-class magistrates, sentences of one month's imprisonment and fines up to Rs. 50.\n\nEuropean British subjects are within the jurisdiction of the civil courts of the State and, in cases of contempt, of the criminal courts as well. For the trial of other offences by them, the State appoints one or more European British subjects as special magistrates for the trial of Europeans, and the Government of India gazettes them as Justices of the Peace. They have power to sentence European British subjects to three months' imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 1,000. An appeal lies to the European Judge of the Chief Court. The Resident is a Justice of the Peace, with the powers of a District Magistrate and Sessions Judge over such subjects. An appeal from his decisions lies to the Madras High Court.\n\nWhen the State finds it necessary to legislate on any subject, the law committee, a standing committee consisting of a president and seven members appointed for a period of three years, is requested to prepare and submit a draft bill. This, after undergoing such revision as is found necessary by the Diw\u0101n, is submitted to the Government of Madras for approval through the British Resident. In some cases, however, bills are drafted without the intervention of the law committee. When the bill is approved by the Madras Government, it is submitted to the R\u0101j\u0101, on receiving whose assent it becomes law. All enactments are called Regulations. At present forty-five such Regulations are in force. They are framed on the lines of corresponding enactments in British India. In cases of emergency, the R\u0101j\u0101 issues proclamations in his own name, which also have the force of law.\nAll land in Cochin was originally private property in fee-simple (janmam). No regular tax was levied, but non-Brahman land-holders had to render military service when required. The ruler of the State derived his income from crown lands, customs, monopolies, &c. These crown lands, which are now the janmam of the State, increased in extent from time to time by escheat, confiscation, and purchase, so that they now comprise more than a third of the occupied area. A small assessment was imposed for the first time in 1762, probably to meet the increasing expenditure caused by wars with the neighbouring chiefs. Subsequently, there were several piecemeal surveys of particular areas or particular kinds of land, but the first general survey and settlement of 'dry' land were carried out in 1815 and of 'wet' land in 1821. The 'dry' land was again surveyed and settled in 1843 and 1862. A systematic survey of all land in the State is now in progress, and a scheme for its resettlement is under consideration.\n\nThe tenures and sub-tenures under which State and private janmam lands are held are multifarious, ranging from permanent leases at a nominal rent to tenancies-at-will. The assessments are made up of a variety of imposts and vary, on State land, from Rs. 14 to R. 1 for 'wet' land and from R. 0-12-0 to R. 0-6-10 for 'dry' land per acre. Separate taxes are collected on each jack, coco-nut, and areca-nut tree. About 11,000 acres of land are inam, or held on favourable tenure.\n\nIn Cochin no municipal councils or local boards have been established; but in all the towns, and in Tripunittura, Nemmar, and the Nelliampathy, sanitary boards, financed by the State, look after local sanitation.\n\nThe Public Works department is under a Chief Engineer, assisted by two divisional and six subdivisional officers. The expenditure during the ten years ending 1904 averaged 4\u00bd lakhs. Among the more important public buildings constructed or improved are some of the palaces at Tripunittura, the Darbar Hall, the Diwan's office, the Chief Court and the College at Ernakulam, the public offices at Trichur, and the Residencies at Ernakulam and Trichur. The only important irrigation works in the State are those at Mulattura and Nami on the Anaimalai river.\n\nThe State maintains a small force, consisting of 309 infantry, 16 cavalry, and 4 guns. The British detachment stationed in Cochin after the treaty of 1809 was withdrawn in 1900.\n\nThe police force is under the control of a Superintendent, and consists of 504 constables working under 7 inspectors. There are 29 police stations in the State. The Ernakulam jail has accommodation for 200 prisoners. Nine subsidiary jails for short-term prisoners are maintained at the head-quarters of the sub-magistrates.\n\nCochin stands at the head of all the Districts and States in Southern\nIndia, except Madras City, in the literacy of its population, of whom 13.4 per cent. (22.4 males and 4.5 females) are able to read and write. At the end of 1903-4 it contained 1,510 educational institutions with 48,079 pupils. Of these, 241 were public institutions, of which 58 were managed directly by the State, 127 were under private management but aided, and 2, though unaided, conformed to the rules of the department. They included 147 primary, 33 secondary, and 6 special schools, and one second-grade college at Ernakulam. Of the special schools, one is a training institution, three are Sanskrit schools, and the remaining two are elementary industrial schools. In some of the private schools, which number 1,800 and contain 27,529 pupils, only the Koran or the rudiments of Sanskrit or native singing are taught.\n\nOf the boys and girls of school-going age, 57 and 22 per cent. respectively were receiving instruction, but only 8.1 per cent. of the boys and 0.94 per cent. of the girls under instruction had passed the primary stage. In point of primary education, Christians stand first and Musalmans last, but in the matter of higher education Hindus take the lead. The total expenditure on education in 1903-4 was Rs. 99,000, of which Rs. 36,000 was derived from fees.\n\nThere are 10 hospitals and 3 dispensaries in the State, with accommodation for 244 in-patients. The total number of cases treated in 1903-4 was 185,000, of whom 3,700 were in-patients, and the number of operations performed was 7,700. The lady doctors attached to the hospitals at Mattancheri and Trichur treated 19,000 women and 13,000 children. The total expenditure on the department was Rs. 65,000.\n\nIn 1903-4 the number of persons successfully vaccinated was 19,000, or 24 per 1,000 of the population. Vaccination is not compulsory anywhere in the State.\n\n[For further particulars of the State, see the Census Reports of 1891 and 1901.]\n\nCochin Taluk.\u2014Coast subdivision and taluk in the south of Malabar District, Madras, situated in 9\u00b0 58' N. and 76\u00b0 14' E., with an area of 2 square miles. It contains one amman, or parish, and is surrounded on all sides but the west by the Native State of Cochin. The population increased from 23,715 in 1891 to 25,859 in 1901. The land revenue demand in 1903-4 amounted to Rs. 20,000. The headquarters are at the seaport of Cochin (population, 19,274). The villages of Anjengo and Tangasseri were treated, for administrative purposes, as portions of the Cochin taluk up to 1906, when they were formed into a new District of Anjengo under the control of the Resident in Travancore and Cochin.\n\nCochin Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the subdivision and taluk of British Cochin in Malabar District, Madras, situated in 9\u00b0 58' N. and 76\u00b0 14' E., on the coast within the limits of the Native State of Cochin. The\nnorthern portion of the town contains several streets of picturesque Dutch houses. The Anglican church, a plain massive building, was formerly the principal chapel of the Franciscan monastery. The age of the present structure is unknown, but inscriptions on the tombstones formerly in the floor of the nave prove the existence of a church on the spot before 1546. The backwater forms a magnificent natural harbour several square miles in area, with a deep-water basin of 7 to 9 fathoms near the mouth, which is kept from silting up by the heavy scour of the tides. The bar is at a distance of about a mile from the shore, and carries a maximum of 18 feet of water and a minimum of 12 feet. It has frequently been proposed to make the harbour available for ocean-going vessels by deepening the bar and running out breakwaters, but the expense and difficulties of the undertaking have hitherto prevented anything being done. At present steamers anchor about 2 miles off the shore in 5\u00bd to 6\u00bd fathoms.\n\nThe tradition is that Cochin was originally a small town on the bank of a small river (Kochi, 'little'), and that it was swept away in 1341 by violent floods, which changed the whole face of the neighbourhood, forming the present harbour and the island of Vypin. Tradition is supported by the fact that the term Pudiya Veppu ('new deposit') is used to denote an era beginning in 1341; and there is no doubt that violent changes of this nature have frequently taken place along the coast. The present situation, commanding the entrance to a backwater which taps an immense area of rich country, soon attracted settlers, and Cochin became the successful rival of the port of Cranganur.\n\nThe history of the present town begins with the arrival of the Portuguese. In 1500 Cabral came to Cochin after his attack on Calicut and met with a friendly reception from the Raja, who is described as a reluctant vassal of the Zamorin. He returned to Portugal with a large cargo of pepper. In 1502 Vasco da Gama on his second voyage visited Cochin and founded a factory. The next year Albuquerque arrived just in time to assist the Cochin Raja, who was besieged by the Zamorin in Vypin. The Zamorin was driven off and Albuquerque was permitted to build the Cochin fort, which he called Manuel Kotta. It was the first European fort built in India. In 1504 Pacheco, who was left in charge of the fort, was besieged by the Zamorin, but managed with some difficulty to repel the attack. The next year Almeyda arrived as viceroy, and rebuilt and enlarged the fort; and the Portuguese settlement does not appear to have been further troubled by the Zamorin. It became the chief of their settlements till the capture of Goa. In 1530 St. Francis Xavier came to Cochin and made many converts; in 1557 the church of Santa Cruz was consecrated as the cathedral of the Bishop of Cochin; and in 1577 the\nSociety of Jesus published at Cochin the first book printed in India in native characters. The first Englishman to visit the town was Ralph Fitch, a traveller, who came by way of Bagdad and the Persian Gulf in 1585; but no English settlement was made till 1634, when the East India Company entered into a treaty which gave them free access to Portuguese ports. In the next year pepper was for the first time exported direct from the west coast to England. In 1663 the town and fort were captured by the Dutch, and the English retired to Ponnani. Under the Dutch the trade of Cochin increased considerably, and the customs are said to have amounted to Rs. 30,000 annually. The Dutch remodelled the town, building substantial European houses, quays, &c. They also converted the cathedral of Santa Cruz into a warehouse. Later on the fort was entirely rebuilt by Van Moens (1778). The cathedral, the fort, and many of the Dutch houses were subsequently blown up (1806) by the English. On the conquest of Holland by the French in 1795 the East India Company was ordered to take possession of all the Dutch colonies. The Dutch governor, Vanspall, refused to surrender Cochin; and it was therefore besieged and captured by Major Petrie, on October 20, 1795. The settlement was taken under English protection, but the Dutch were allowed to retain their laws and administration. The town was finally ceded to the Company under the Paris Convention of 1814.\n\nCochin is now the chief port of Malabar and the third in importance in the Madras Presidency. The value of its imports in 1903-4 was 82 lakhs, and of its exports 208 lakhs. During the last twenty years the trade of the port has trebled. The main exports are coco-nut oil and coir. Cochin monopolizes the trade of the Presidency in the former and possesses three-fourths of the trade in the latter. There is also an increasing export of tea from Travancore, its value in 1903-4 amounting to nearly 10 lakhs. Of the import trade more than half is in rice, from Burma and Bengal. The other chief articles of trade are pepper, timber, cotton twist and piece-goods, and kerosene oil. The population in 1901 was 19,274, of whom more than half were Christians, including a large Eurasian community. The income of the municipality, which was constituted in 1866, during the decade ending 1900 averaged Rs. 20,300 and the expenditure Rs. 19,500. In 1903-4 the corresponding figures were Rs. 22,600 and Rs. 21,700, the main source of income being the taxes on houses and land. The climate is very moist and hot, and elephantiasis is common owing to the bad water. A scheme is now under consideration for bringing a supply from the Alwaye river, about 20 miles distant.\n\nCocos.\u2014Two islands in the Bay of Bengal, lying between 14\u00b0 4' and 14\u00b0 10' N. and in 93\u00b0 22' E., 45 miles north-east of the Andaman Islands, with which they are geologically connected, and a short distance south of Table Island, on which there is a lighthouse. They\nform part of the Hanthawaddy District of Lower Burma. Their area is small, the larger island being about 14 square miles in extent, and the smaller about 2\u00bd miles long and a mile broad. They are flat, waterless, unpopulated, and covered with coco-nut palms and forest jungle. The Cocos have been leased by Government for the sake of their vegetable produce, and are visited from time to time by coco-nut gatherers.\n\nCoimbatore District (Koyamuttir).\u2014An inland District in the south of the Madras Presidency, lying between 10\u00b0 15' and 11\u00b0 18' N. and 76\u00b0 39' and 78\u00b0 14' E., with an area of 7,860 square miles.\n\nWest and south it is bounded by the highest hills in the Presidency, the Nilgiris and the Anaimalais, the latter of which are perhaps the most striking range in Southern India, consisting of a series of plateaux, some rising to 7,000 feet in elevation, with forests of great importance.\n\nThrough the three northern taluks run the confused hills of the Eastern Ghats, one of which, Kolleg\u0101l, is on a higher level than the rest of the District. Excluding this, the centre of Coimbatore consists of an open plain, sloping gradually eastwards away from the hills towards the river Cauvery, the eastern boundary of the District. The plain is broken here and there by isolated low hills; but otherwise, except in the level black cotton-soil tracts in the Udamalpet, Palladam, and Coimbatore taluks, it is made up of a succession of gentle undulations between which the rivers run. Its scenery differs little from that of the adjoining east coast Districts, except that the frequent green patches of cultivation near its numerous wells give it in the dry season an unusually prosperous look. The spurs of the Eastern Ghats in the three northern taluks form two well-marked minor ranges, known as the Biligiri-Rangans and the Bargur hills. The former, which consist of two ridges running up into peaks of over 5,000 feet, lie on the extreme west of the Kolleg\u0101l taluk, extending into Mysore territory. The latter stand between the Bhav\u0101ni and Kolleg\u0101l taluks, and are called after a village which lies among them. They form a long narrow plateau over 3,000 feet in height. In both of these ranges the scenery is always picturesque, while in many of the lower valleys the heavy jungle is particularly wild. Of the hills on the western frontier of the District the most conspicuous are Rangasw\u0101mi Peak and Lambton's Peak.\n\nExcept the Aliy\u0101r, an unimportant stream, all the larger rivers run eastwards, following the trend of the ground, into the Cauvery, the most important river of the District and the boundary along the whole of its northern and eastern sides. At the north-west corner of Kolleg\u0101l this forms the famous Falls of Sivasamudram, well-known for their beauty, and now utilized to generate electricity for the machinery at the\nKol\u0101r Gold Fields, and for lighting the city of Bangalore. The Bhav\u0101ni, a perennial river, which rises in the Attap\u0101di valley in Malabar, crosses the District from west to east just south of the three northern upland taluks, and flows into the Cauvery at Bhav\u0101ni town. The Noyil, a fitful and uncertain stream, which is in high and rapid flood for a few days and then for months together almost dry, has its source in the Bolampatti valley among the outlying spurs of the Nilgiris, and passes through Coimbatore city on its way to the Cauvery. The Amar\u0101vati rises in the Anaimalai hills, receives the drainage of the northern slopes of the Palni hills in Madura District, and, after passing through Dh\u0101rapuram and Kar\u016br towns, joins the Cauvery at the point where the Districts of Coimbatore and Trichinopoly touch one another.\n\nMost of the south of the District is composed of Archaean gneisses buried to a considerable extent under surface alluvium. The uniform level of the plain is sparingly broken at irregular intervals by small bands of members of the charnockite series of rocks, by one small band of syenite gneiss near K\u0101ngayam, and by upstanding crags and ridges of crystalline schists. The northern hilly tracts include a vast area of charnockite rock. Near Kolleg\u0101l are a few ferruginous bands and poor quartz reefs. Near K\u0101ngayam some very coarse ramifications of acid pegmatites once yielded beryl; and in the same locality corundum, which also occurs elsewhere, is found in a coarse red felspar rock.\n\nThe flora is naturally very varied, since the elevation and the rainfall of the District differ greatly in different parts. The higher plateaux of the Anaimalais, the low hills of the northern taluks, and the dry central plain each possess their own characteristic plants and trees. The forest growth and the commoner crops are referred to briefly below. In the low country the trees differ little from those of neighbouring areas, and are usually of poor growth. Fruit trees are scarce. The well-known tangedu (Cussia auriculata), the bark of which is used in tanning, and fibres, resins, and vegetable oils of the common descriptions are abundant.\n\nThe hill country contains all the game usual to such localities. Elephants are common in the Anaimalais and also occur in the Biligiri-Rangan hills in Satyamangalam. Near H\u0101san\u016br in the latter taluk Sir Victor Brooke shot (in 1863) the largest elephant on record in this Presidency. It stood 11 feet 4 inches at the highest point of its back, and one of its tusks measured 8 feet in length and weighed 90 lb., the other being diseased.\n\nAmong rarer animals are the Nilgiri ibex (Hemitragus hylocrius), the hunting leopard (Cyn\u00e6cturus jubatus), nilgai (Boselaphus tragocamelus), said to be descended from some tame ones which belonged to Tip\u016b Sult\u0101n, and an occasional wolf. There are mahseer of unusual size in the Bhav\u0101ni and Cauvery.\nThe lower hills of the District are malarious, especially from February to June, but elsewhere the climate of Coimbatore is unusually dry and proportionately healthy. The temperature varies inversely with the altitude, being highest in the low-lying Cauvery valley, more moderate in the uplands on the west, pleasant in the Kollegal taluk, as cool as the Salem Shevaroys in the Bargur hills, and coolest of all on the higher ranges of the Anaimalais. The average mean of the year at Coimbatore city is $80^\\circ$, compared with $83^\\circ$ at Madras.\n\nThe rainfall, like the temperature, varies considerably in different parts of the District. The Kollegal taluk receives some of the southwest monsoon and consequently has the heaviest fall, and the Pollachi taluk gets more rain than the Cauvery valley or the central plain of the District. This plain is the driest tract in the Presidency, except the centre of Bellary District. The annual fall for the whole District averages about 26 inches. The rainfall is, however, exceedingly capricious and uncertain, and the country is liable to frequent cycles of continuous deficiency in the monsoons, causing long droughts. Thirty-one lives were lost in an earthquake which occurred on February 8, 1900.\n\nThe District was never a political entity and its history is not of particular interest. Coimbatore and the south-western taluks of the present Salem District formed the Kongu country, and Coimbatore is still called the Kongunad. During the ninth century the Kongu country passed under the Chola kings, who held it for nearly 200 years. It then broke up into a number of small principalities, which during the eleventh century fell an easy prey to the Hoysala Ballala kings of Mysore. In the fourteenth century, this dynasty in its turn gave way to the empire of Vijayanagar, which held the country until its downfall in 1565. Coimbatore then came into the hands of the Vijayanagar deputy at Seringapatam, who, like his colleagues, had assumed independent powers, and shortly afterwards passed from him to the deputy at Madura. During the second half of the seventeenth century the whole District seems to have been a prey to constant wars and raids, owing to the conflict between the Vijayanagar deputies and the growing power of Mysore. Kaveripuram was attacked in 1644, Satyamangalam was taken in 1653, Erode and Dharpapuram in 1667; and before Chikka Deva Raja of Mysore died in 1704 the whole of the District had come under his dominion. But it continued to be largely ruled through the agency of paligars, or petty chieftains, whose powers were almost absolute and who used them ruthlessly, and the people gained little by the change of sovereigns. In 1761 Haidar Ali usurped the Mysore throne. During the forty years of Muhammadan rule which followed, until the District passed to the Company after the defeat and death of Haidar's son Tipu Sultan at Seringapatam in 1799,\nit was the scene of incessant marches and countermarches, advances and retreats, by the British and the Mysore troops; and the forts scattered through it, notably those at Erode, Kar\u016br, Dh\u0101r\u0101puram, and Coimbatore, were constantly taken and retaken in the numberless engagements which occurred. On four distinct occasions the District became the field of conflict between the British and Mysore powers. At the end of 1760 a British force took Kar\u016br, in retaliation for the assistance rendered in that year by Haidar to the French near Pondicherry; but, owing to the fact that Haidar was about this time expelled from Seringapatam and the Mysore officers in this District disclaimed any connexion with his acts, hostilities were carried no farther. In 1768, while Haidar was busy on the west coast, Colonel Wood marched through the District and, having completely conquered it, garrisoned the passes and the chief fortified places. His garrisons, however, were weak, and, in spite of the heroic resistance of some of them, every place in the District either fell or was abandoned before Haidar's advance at the end of the same year. In what is called the first Mysore War, while Tip\u016b was engaged on the west coast in 1783, Colonel Lang entered Coimbatore to effect a diversion and took Kar\u016br and Dh\u0101r\u0101puram; and later in the same year Colonel Fullarton marched through the District to relieve Mangalore, taking Coimbatore on the way. In the second Mysore War the District was the scene of considerable operations, since General Medows occupied it with a large force in 1790 and designed to invade Mysore by the pass of Gazalhatti. In September of the same year, however, Tip\u016b descended that pass with a large army, and, after two stubborn engagements with Colonel Floyd at Satyamangalam, compelled the British forces to retreat and reoccupied all the forts in the District except Coimbatore and Kar\u016br. Of these, Coimbatore fell after a gallant defence in the following year, and Kar\u016br was restored to Tip\u016b after the peace of 1792. Seven years later the District passed under British rule. Haidar had done something to check the poligars' exactions; but his taxes were excessive, trade was crushed by numerous duties, and the peasantry were at the mercy of the troops who continually overran their villages, so that, when the British took it over, the District was in a pitiful condition.\n\nThroughout the District, even on the Anaimalais, are scattered prehistoric kistvaens, which have been found to contain bones, pottery, implements, ornaments, and bronze images, and in one case 'punch-marked' coins. Several discoveries of Roman coins\u00b9, chiefly of Augustus and Tiberius, have been made. Jain temples and remains are not infrequent. The most noteworthy Hindu temple is that at\n\n\u00b9 See Catalogue No. 2 of Roman, Indo-Portuguese, &c., Coins in the Madras Museum, by E. Thurston (Madras, 1894).\nPer\u016br, but even this is a modern erection and the work in it is pretentious and coarse.\n\nThe number of towns and villages in the District is 1,445. The population in 1871 was 1,763,274; in 1881, 1,657,690; in 1891, 2,004,839; and in 1901, 2,201,752. The decline in 1881 was due to the great famine of 1876\u20138. About 97 per cent. of the people are Hindus and more than 2 per cent. Musalmans. The District is divided into ten taluks\u2014Bhav\u0101ni, Coimbatore, Dh\u0101r\u0101puram, Erode, Kar\u016br, Kolleg\u0101l, Palladam, Poll\u0101chi, Satyamangalam, and Ud\u0101malpet\u2014statistical particulars of which, according to the Census of 1901, are appended:\n\n| Taluk       | Area in square miles | Number of Towns | Villages | Population | Population per square mile | Percentage of population between 1891 and 1901 | Number of persons able to read and write |\n|-------------|----------------------|-----------------|----------|------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Kolleg\u0101l    | 1,076                | 1               | 112      | 96,563     | 90                        | + 9.1                                         | 4,020                                  |\n| Erode       | 598                  | 1               | 198      | 275,460    | 461                       | + 11.5                                        | 10,553                                 |\n| Bhav\u0101ni     | 715                  | 1               | 62       | 145,082    | 204                       | + 31.8                                        | 4,880                                  |\n| Dh\u0101r\u0101puram  | 853                  | 1               | 83       | 271,127    | 318                       | + 7.2                                         | 12,825                                 |\n| Kar\u016br       | 612                  | 1               | 95       | 220,843    | 361                       | + 4.3                                         | 11,595                                 |\n| Coimbatore  | 813                  | 1               | 263      | 330,684    | 407                       | + 7.6                                         | 25,544                                 |\n| Satyamangalam | 1,177              | 1               | 175      | 314,101    | 182                       | + 16.3                                        | 7,375                                  |\n| Poll\u0101chi   | 710                  | 1               | 158      | 192,658    | 276                       | + 6.5                                         | 11,179                                 |\n| Palladam   | 741                  | 1               | 193      | 306,904    | 406                       | + 11.3                                        | 12,992                                 |\n| Ud\u0101malpet  | 566                  | 1               | 86       | 156,480    | 266                       | + 7.9                                         | 10,746                                 |\n| District total | 7,860             | 10              | 1,435    | 2,201,752  | 280                       | + 9.8                                         | 111,309                                |\n\nThe head-quarters of the taluks (except of Satyamangalam, which is at Gopichettip\u0101laiyam) are at the places from which each is named. The chief towns are the municipalities of Coimbatore, the administrative head-quarters of the District, Erode, and Kar\u016br.\n\nOwing to the large areas of forest which Coimbatore comprises, it is less densely populated than the other southern Districts of Madras; but during the decade ending 1901 the inhabitants increased at an unusual rate, the advance in the sparsely peopled taluks of Bhav\u0101ni and Satyamangalam being specially notable, notwithstanding that considerable numbers emigrated to the Nilgiris and Madura. Though the District is in the Tamil country, as many as 21 per cent. of the people speak Telegu; and in the Kolleg\u0101l taluk Kanarese, the language of the adjoining State of Mysore, is spoken by 78 per cent. of the inhabitants.\n\nBy far the most numerous caste in Coimbatore are the agriculturist Vell\u0101las, who are twice as strong here as in any other Madras District except Salem, numbering 690,000, or 31 per cent. of the population. Other common cultivating castes are the Kanarese Vakkaligas and the\nTelugu Kammas and Tottiyans. After the Vellalas come the Chakkiliyans (leather-workers), who number 197,000, being more than twice as numerous as in any other District. Next come the Shanans (toddy-drawers), 79,000; and after them the Paraiyans (field-labourers), 76,000, and the Oddes (well-sinkers and earth-workers), 74,000. Other castes which appear in strength are the Pallans and Pallis, who are also mainly field-labourers, and the weaving communities of the Kaikolans, Devangas, and Janappans. Brahmins are unusually few, numbering only 30,000, or less than 2 per cent of the population. These statistics correspond with those of the occupations of the people; for though the District is essentially an agricultural one, 65 per cent. of the people living by the land, it is less so than most, owing to the unusually large proportion who are toddy-drawers, leather-workers, earth-workers, and weavers. Among castes which are seldom found elsewhere may be mentioned the two jungle tribes of the Sholagas of the North Coimbatore hills and the Malasars of the Anaimalais.\n\nOf the 17,800 native Christians in the District, over 15,000 are Roman Catholics. The Jesuit Fathers of the famous Madura Mission had a chapel at Dharmapuram as early as 1608. In 1739 a Bull of Pope Clement XII, prohibiting certain Hindu customs tolerated till then, caused dissensions and apostasy. Then came the cessation of support from Portugal, and finally the suppression of the Society of Jesus by Clement XIV in 1773. The missionaries struggled on nevertheless; and in 1845 they were formed into a distinct mission, in charge of the French priests of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Missions \u00c9trang\u00e8res, which in 1850 was made a bishopric. The London, Leipzig Evangelical Lutheran, and Wesleyan Methodist are the chief Protestant missions. These have been working in the District for about the last seventy, forty, and twenty years respectively.\n\nThe Kollegal taluk differs as much from the rest of the District in agricultural conditions as it does in climate and altitude. Elsewhere gneiss is the chief underlying rock, and the soils derived from it are of fair composition, chemically considered. The four eastern taluks\u2014Bhavani, Erode, Dharmapuram, and Karur\u2014are covered almost entirely with thin gravelly, sandy, or agglomerated calcareous soils, and these soils occupy more than half of the western taluks also. In three of the latter, however\u2014Coimbatore, Palladam, and Udamalpet\u2014more than one-sixth of the cultivable area consists of black cotton soil, while in the two others, Pollachi and Satyamangalam, there is a good deal of rich red loam. At the foot of the undulations of which all this part of the District consists is generally a layer of better soil, which the light rainfall has washed down from the higher ground, and these bottoms are more than usually fertile. In\n\n---\n\n* See the four volumes of La Mission du Madura (Paris, 1847-8, 1865).\nthem are to be found the majority of the numerous wells for which the District is noted. Both 'wet' and 'dry crops' on all classes of soil are mostly matured with the help of the north-east monsoon in October and November.\n\nThe District is almost entirely ryotw\u0101r\u012b, the zamind\u0101r\u012b and in\u0101m lands covering only 684 square miles. The area for which particulars are on record is 7,672 square miles, statistics of which for 1903-4 are given in the following table, in square miles:\n\n| Taluk     | Area shown in accounts | Forests | Cultivable waste | Cultivated | Irrigated |\n|-----------|------------------------|---------|------------------|------------|-----------|\n| Kolleg\u0101l  | 1,187                  | 718     | 239              | 162        | 11        |\n| Erode     | 600                    | 16      | 6                | 530        | 92        |\n| Bhav\u0101ni   | 715                    | 372     | 70               | 253        | 36        |\n| Dh\u0101r\u0101puram| 854                    | 5       | 5                | 776        | 106       |\n| Kar\u016br     | 575                    | 3       | 4                | 506        | 61        |\n| Coimbatore| 814                    | 208     | 31               | 500        | 71        |\n| Satyamangalam| 1,056            | 534     | 45               | 379        | 72        |\n| Poll\u0101chi | 584                    | 200     | 1                | 349        | 38        |\n| Palladam  | 739                    | ...     | 7                | 671        | 117       |\n| Udamalpet| 548                    | 222     | ...              | 295        | 67        |\n| **Total** | **7,672**              | **2,278**| **408**          | **4,412**  | **671**   |\n\nThe staple food-grains of the District are cholam and cambu, the areas under which in 1903-4 were 1,933 and 1,010 square miles, or 26 and 25 per cent. respectively of the total area cropped. Cholam is the most prominent crop of the southern and western taluks, and cambu of the east and north of the District. Next in importance come various pulses and r\u0101gi. About one-fourth of the latter is grown in Kolleg\u0101l. Rice occupied only 193 square miles in 1903-4. Cotton is mainly grown in the Erode, Palladam, and Udamalpet taluks, and sugar-cane in Coimbatore and Udamalpet. Tobacco is an important crop everywhere except in Erode and Kolleg\u0101l, and there are about 1,400 acres under coffee. In Kolleg\u0101l 8,000 acres produce mulberry, which is cultivated to feed the silkworms bred there.\n\nThe extension of the area of holdings during the last thirty years has amounted to 5 per cent., though three-fourths of the arable area in Kolleg\u0101l and considerable tracts in Satyamangalam, Bhav\u0101ni, and Coimbatore are still unoccupied, nor has much been done to improve the quality of the crops grown. Bourbon cotton was introduced at the beginning of the last century, succeeded well, and is still largely grown; but extensive experiments with American varieties have failed. The Mauritius sugar-cane has, however, ousted the indigenous variety. The ryots have availed themselves of the Land Improvement Loans Act far more freely than in any other District in the Presidency. During the sixteen years ending 1904 more than 15 lakhs was advanced under\nthe Act, the greater portion of which has been laid out in digging or repairing wells.\n\nThe chief breeds of cattle in the District are the Alamb\u0101di, Barg\u016br, and K\u0101ngayam. The first are best for heavy draught, the second as trotters, and the last as dairy cattle. The Alamb\u0101dis are sent to the great cattle fair at Madura and to other markets in the southern Districts. There are large local fairs at M\u0101deswaramalai, in the Kolleg\u0101l hills, Avan\u0101shi, and Tirupp\u016br. Ponies have long been bred by the samind\u0101rs and wealthier ryots in Coimbatore; and since 1885 Government has encouraged the enterprise by supplying stallions, eight of which are now stationed in various towns in the District. The annual pony shows held under Government control at Tirupp\u016br have demonstrated that an improvement in the breed has already taken place and that a further advance may be looked for. Sheep are of two breeds, the Kurumba and the Semmeri. The former is a black-faced sheep with white wool. The Semmeri sheep are brown, and covered with hair instead of wool, and are valued only for their flesh. Goats are bred mainly for their manure.\n\nOf the total area of ryotw\u0101ri and 'minor in\u0101m' land cultivated, 671 square miles, or 19 per cent., were irrigated in 1903-4. Of this as much as 502 square miles was watered from wells, while Government canals irrigated 119 square miles, and tanks only 35 square miles. The Cauvery supplies about 5,500 acres, of which 1,000 are in the Kolleg\u0101l taluk and the remainder in Kar\u016br. Various channels from the Am\u0101r\u0101vati, fed by korambus, or temporary dams across the river, irrigate 44,000 acres of first and second crop in the Ud\u0101malpet, Dh\u0101rapuram, and Kar\u016br taluks. Two dams across the Bhav\u0101ni irrigate 39,000 acres in the Satyamangalam and Erode taluks. Of the 151 tanks in the District, the only ones of importance are the Appakkudal chain in the Bhav\u0101ni taluk, fed by streams from the Barg\u016br hills, and the Dhali series in the Ud\u0101malpet taluk, supplied from the An\u0101malais. The wells of the District are its mainstay. They irrigate three times the area which the Government channels and tanks supply, and are unfailing in all but the severest droughts. About 74,000 of them are in working order, and they permit the growth of two and even three crops a year on the land commanded by them. Leathern buckets drawn up with a rope and pulley by cattle working down an inclined plane are universally used for lifting the water.\n\nCoimbatore is one of the few Districts in the Presidency which has real forests, as distinguished from the patches of scrub and small trees which make up the greater portion of the technical forest area. It\n\n---\n\nFor further particulars, and an account of the breeding herd of the Pattagar of P\u0101laiyakkottai in this District, and of the grasses grown for pasture, see Bulletins Nos. 8, 27, and 44 of the department of Land Records and Agriculture.\nconsequently has two District Forest officers, instead of one as usual, whose charges are known as North and South Coimbatore. The District possesses 2,008 square miles of 'reserved' forests, besides 270 square miles, mainly in Kollegal, of 'reserved' land at the disposal of the Forest department.\n\nIn North Coimbatore nearly the whole of the forests are in the three hilly northern taluks of Bhavani, Kollegal, and Satyamangalam. The greater part of these are at present chiefly valuable as grazing-ground for cattle. They must have been at one time much finer than at present; but, owing no doubt to the large number of villages situated in the 'reserved' area, they have suffered from forest fires and perhaps from excessive grazing. At present they form only a poor catchment area for water, which is apt to flow down to the plains in sudden and destructive floods after rain. Still, though the trees are small, there are a number of valuable species. Sandal and cutch form an almost continuous belt running from the west of Satyamangalam to the east of Bhavani. In patches along the valley of the Cauvery the hills are covered with acha (Hardwickia binata); and teak is found in the Bargur hills, in some of the valleys of Kollegal, and on the plateau above Satyamangalam. Vengai (Pterocarpus Marsupium) is common almost everywhere, j\u00e1l (Shorea Talura) is fairly abundant, black-wood (Dalbergia latifolia), Eugenia, Terminalia, and many other valuable species occur frequently in the damper areas, while the drier parts contain a considerable amount of satin-wood, Albizzia, and Anogeissus. A large revenue is obtained from minor forest produce, the principal items being tanning material in the shape of myrabolans and tangedu bark (Cassia auriculata), while soap-nuts (Sapindus trifoliatus), sth\u0101y (Acacia concinna), vemb\u0101dam bark (Vetilogo madraspatana), and honey and wax are also of importance.\n\nThe most important part of the South Coimbatore forests lies on the Anaimalais, in the Pollachi and Udamalpet taluks, and is described in the account of that range. In the Coimbatore taluk the forests run along the western frontier, consisting chiefly of those lying up the Bhavani valley, those about Lambton's Peak range south of this, and those in the Bolampatti valley yet farther south. The Bhavani valley forests produce fair black-wood and vengai and excellent rentek (Lagerstroemia microcarpa) and wild mango, but the difficulties of transport are great. The Bolampatti forests also produce fine black-wood and vengai, though their chief value lies in the protection they give to the head-waters of the Noyil river. In 1903-4 the receipts from the forests amounted to Rs. 2,74,000, and the charges to Rs. 2,15,000. Of the former the most considerable items were timber (Rs. 66,000, of which all but Rs. 5,000 came from South Coimbatore), grazing fees (Rs. 67,000, of which Rs. 56,000 came from the northern division), sandal-\nwood (Rs. 28,000, all of which came from the same tract), and firewood and charcoal (Rs. 23,000).\n\nThe minerals of the District are hardly worked at all. In Bhav\u0101ni and Satyamangalam iron is rudely smelted in small quantities from the black iron-sand, and being much harder than English iron is in considerable demand. In Kolleg\u0101l and Satyamangalam the old gold-workings have lately been under exploration. Saltpetre is obtained in large quantities by lixiviating the alkaline soils during the hot season in shallow mud vessels, and then boiling the resultant liquid in large pans. The process gives a crude saltpetre fit for manure. For pure saltpetre a second or even a third boiling is necessary. In 1903 as many as 871 native factories and fifteen refineries were reported to be at work. Saltpetre is coming into increasing use as a manure on coffee estates. A mine near K\u0101ngayam produced beryl of some value in 1819\u201320, when it was last worked. It has been suggested that this mine was the source of the Indian beryl mentioned by Pliny, and that the export to Rome is the main reason for the numerous finds of Roman coins which have been made in the District. Corundum is worked by natives in an irregular fashion at Salangaipp\u0101laiyam, 8 miles from Bhav\u0101ni, at Gopichettip\u0101laiyam, and at Sivannalai in the Dh\u0101r\u0101puram taluk. The last-named deposits are the richest.\n\nThe only important arts in the District are cotton- and silk-weaving and the making of cotton carpets. Cotton-weaving is of the ordinary kind, only coarse cloths being made. Silk-weaving is carried on only in the Kolleg\u0101l taluk, where silkworms are bred in considerable numbers. The dyes used are good, and the cloths effective and handsome. In some cases they are ornamented by the introduction of gold and silver embroidery, and the gold-laced cloths and kerchiefs are well-known. These sometimes sell for as much as Rs. 300 each, and even more, according to the quantity and quality of the embroidery, which, in the highest-priced cloths, is woven in intricate and elegant designs into the texture of the cloth while still on the loom. The cloths are sold locally, or sent to Madras, Bangalore, and Mysore. Small cotton carpets are made at Bhav\u0101ni. White yarn, spun at the Coimbatore mills, is used for the warp, and the cotton for the woof is dyed locally. The Cauvery water is said to make peculiarly brilliant and fast dyes. The carpets are sold locally or sent to Trichinopoly and Madras. At Settip\u0101laiyam near Tirupp\u016br a\n\n---\n\n1 For a detailed account of the matter see Memoirs, Geological Survey of India, vol. xxxiii, pp. 53\u201367.\n2 Indian Antiquary, vol. v, p. 237.\n3 See Part I (Corundum) of the Economic Section of the Manual of the Geology of India (Calcutta, 1898).\nfew families of lapidaries grind crystals on emery disks for spectacles, and also make them into lingams and other sacred images. At Anai-palaiyam, a neighbouring village, good bell-metal gongs are manufactured, the constituents of the particular alloy used being a trade secret.\n\nThere are eight cotton-cleaning and pressing factories in the District. Five of these have been working for many years, and four are driven by steam. They clean or press the local cotton for export to Bombay and England, and employ an average of 300 hands daily, and press annually 3,000 tons of cotton, valued at 15 lakhs. At Coimbatore there is a recently established spinning-mill. Particulars of this and other industrial enterprises there are given in the article on that city. Leather-making is an important industry in the District. There is a tannery under European management at Coimbatore, and another at Mettupalaiyam. Leather buckets for the numerous wells in the District are made in thousands annually, as each well requires a new bucket once a year.\n\nThe chief exports are cereals and pulses, chillies, turmeric, spices, cotton, oilseeds, tobacco, gh\u012b, sandal-wood, plantains, jaggery, brass and copper vessels, cattle, and leather; while the chief imports include rice, salt, salted fish, piece-goods and twist, metal and metal-goods, and coco-nut oil. Exports and imports are mainly to and from the neighbouring Districts; but the cotton from the northern taluks goes to Madras and that from the southern to the cotton-presses in Madura and Tinnevelly, the latter mainly by carts, which come in from those parts by the thousand during the cotton harvest. The jaggery goes chiefly to the west coast by road and rail through the P\u0101lgh\u0101t Gap; the tobacco largely to the same country and to North Arcot, where it is cured by Muhammadan dealers. Much of the gh\u012b goes to Mysore. Coco-nut oil is chiefly imported from Malabar. Coimbatore and Dh\u0101r\u0101puram are the chief centres of general trade and Palladam of the cotton trade; and the principal trade castes are the Chettis and Labbais. The N\u0101ttukottai Chettis, the banking sub-caste of the former, are numerous in Udamalpet and Kar\u016br; and of the Labbais a large proportion are to be found in the Kar\u016br taluk, especially at Pallapatti. Most of the internal trade is effected at the numerous weekly markets. These are managed by the local boards, and in 1901 nearly Rs. 50,000 was collected in fees. The most important are those at Poll\u0101chi, Kunnatt\u016br, and K\u0101ngayam.\n\nThe south-west line of the Madras Railway (standard gauge) enters the District on the east about 2 miles from Erode, and runs across to the P\u0101lgh\u0101t Gap on the western frontier. From Podan\u016br a branch leads off to Mettupalaiyam, which is the terminus of the metre-gauge rack railway to Coonoor. The South Indian Railway enters the District\nnear Puliy\u016br and skirts the Cauvery up to Erode, where it joins the Madras Railway. It was converted to metre gauge in 1879. Other railways are under consideration, among them a metre-gauge line from P\u0101lgh\u0101t or Podan\u016br junction to Palni in Madura District by way of Poll\u0101chi and Udamalpet, and another from Erode to Nanjang\u016bd in the State of Mysore through Satyamangalam.\n\nThe total length of metalled roads is 1,269 miles, and of unmetalled roads 459 miles. All these, except 40 miles of metalled and 20 miles of unmetalled road in charge of the Public Works department, are maintained from Local funds. There are avenues of trees along 1,572 miles. The southern part of the District is well supplied with communications; but through the country above the Gh\u0101ts in the three northern t\u0101luks only two roads are practicable for carts, the Barg\u016br gh\u0101\u1e6d and the H\u0101san\u016br gh\u0101\u1e6d. The Gazalhatti pass in the extreme west is a stony track leading up to the Mysore plateau. It was formerly the chief road from Coimbatore to Mysore, but is now used only by pack animals.\n\nThe District has suffered from constant scarcities, owing to the lightness of its rainfall and the absence of large irrigation works. The last ninety-three years have been tabulated as 6 good; 25 fair; 51 unfavourable; and 11 really bad. In 1861 both monsoons failed, prices of 'dry' grains nearly doubled, and state relief was necessary. In 1866 the south-west rains again entirely failed and the north-east monsoon was very light, so that relief was once more required. In the great famine of 1876\u20138 the District suffered very severely. At the height of the famine, in September, 1877, 30,000 persons were on relief works and 204,000 in receipt of gratuitous relief. It was calculated that more than 197,000 persons died of famine or the diseases that accompany it. Including advances to agriculturists and weavers, and remissions of land revenue, the famine in this District alone cost the state 50 lakhs. The last scarcity was in 1891\u20132. In September, 1891, nearly 7,000 persons were on relief works and 460 more were in receipt of gratuitous relief. It is estimated that during this season 127,000 cattle died. Including remissions, the state expended Rs. 1,36,000.\n\nFor general administrative purposes the District is distributed into four subdivisions, one of the officers in charge of which is usually a member of the Indian Civil Service and the others Deputy-Collectors recruited in India. These subdivisions are Erode, comprising the Bhav\u0101ni, Dh\u0101r\u0101puram, Erode, and Kar\u016br t\u0101luks; Poll\u0101chi, comprising Poll\u0101chi, Palladam, and Udamalpet; and Coimbatore and Kolleg\u0101l, the former consisting of the Coimbatore and Satyamangalam t\u0101luks and the latter of Kolleg\u0101l alone. There is a tahsild\u0101r at the head-quarters of each of the t\u0101luks and, except at\nBhav\u0101ni and Kolleg\u0101l, a stationary sub-magistrate also. The superior staff of the District consists of the usual officers, except that, as has already been mentioned, there are two District Forest officers.\n\nThere are four regular District Munsifs, and the Deputy-Collector and Magistrate of Kolleg\u0101l exercises the powers of a District Munsif throughout that t\u0101luk and in the portion of Satyamangalam which lies above the Gh\u0101ts. Appeals from the Sub-Judge of Ootacamund and from the District Munsif's Court at Gudalur in the Nilgiris, where there is an District Court, lie to the District Judge of Coimbatore. The Court of Session hears the sessions cases of the Nilgiris as well as those which arise within the District itself. Murders, dacoities, and cattle-thefts fluctuate in numbers, as elsewhere, with the state of the season, but are more than usually common. Murders proceed in a large majority of cases from private personal motives. The frequency of dacoity and cattle-theft may in part be ascribed to the precarious livelihood which cultivation offers in so arid a tract, and in part to the proximity of Madura District, whence the Kallans, perhaps the most expert criminals in the Presidency, come over to Coimbatore to ply their profession. The system, which is firmly established in Madura, of paying thieves tupp\u016b-k\u016bli, or 'clue-hire,' for the recovery of stolen property, instead of reporting the theft to the police, has also obtained a strong hold in Coimbatore.\n\nLittle is known of the revenue history of the District prior to the time when the kingdom of Mysore was usurped by Haidar Ali. Chikka Deva R\u0101j\u0101 of Mysore (1671\u20131704) made a regular survey of the country. He took two-thirds (in kind) of the gross produce of 'wet' lands, leaving the ryot one-third. When Haidar came into power at Mysore he apparently adopted this survey as the basis of his assessments; but he collected all his rents in money in a single payment, and not by instalments as is now the practice. This forced the ryots to sell immediately after the harvest at ruinously low prices, and much land was consequently abandoned. Tip\u016b Sult\u0101n increased all the assessments by 25 per cent., and yet more land went out of cultivation in consequence; but he was never able to collect this exorbitant demand, and at his death the arrears were enormous, and only the garden lands and some 'wet' land had any sale value.\n\nMajor McLeod, who was the first British Collector of the country north of the Noyil river, the area south of this being included in the then Dindigul District, began in 1800 a regular survey of the Government villages in the District, which he followed by a rough settlement. In the southern part of the District, the Collector (Mr. Hurdis) made a survey and proceeded to estimate the grain-producing value of each field\u2014a new idea in those days, and to commute the Government share\n\n1 The samindar\u012bs were granted on a fixed permanent rent once for all.\ninto a money payment. Neither attempt was successful, the demand in both cases being more than the land could bear. The District as it exists at present was formed in 1805, Coimbatore being made its headquarters. In 1808 the theory of permanent settlements had come into favour, and the District was divided into a number of small revenue farms of two or three villages apiece, which were leased to village headmen and wealthy ryots. This lease system was a complete failure owing to the abuses perpetrated by the renters, and the revenue fell from 21 to 17 lakhs. In 1815 the ryotwari system was restored. A new survey and settlement, resulting in a considerable reduction of assessment, were made; but many of the undesirable characteristics of the old native r\u00e9gime were continued, and it was not until 1864 that revenue administration had reached the present stage. In 1860 a new survey of the District was begun, and in 1872 a resettlement was put in hand, which was completed in 1882. The survey found an excess in the cultivated area of 6\u00bd per cent. over the amount shown in the accounts, and the settlement enhanced the total revenue by 8 per cent., or a little over 2 lakhs. The average assessment on 'dry' land is Rs. 0-14-7 per acre (maximum Rs. 2, minimum 4 annas), and that on 'wet' land Rs. 6-7-6 (maximum Rs. 12, minimum Rs. 2\u00bd).\n\nThe revenue from land and the total revenue in recent years are given in the following table, in thousands of rupees:\n\n|                | 1880-1 | 1890-1 | 1900-1 | 1903-4 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Land revenue   | 28.50  | 30.96  | 33.76  | 34.94  |\n| Total revenue  | 34.61  | 43.98  | 51.27  | 55.25  |\n\nOutside the three municipalities of Coimbatore, Karur, and Erode, local affairs are managed by the District board, and by the four taluk boards of Coimbatore, Erode, Pollachi, and Kollegal, the areas under which correspond with those of the four administrative subdivisions. The total expenditure of these boards in 1903-4 was about 4\u00bd lakhs, nearly half of which was laid out on roads and buildings. The chief source of their income is, as usual, the land cess. In addition, the affairs of 21 of the smaller towns are managed by Union panchayats, established under Madras Act V of 1884.\n\nThe District Superintendent of police at Coimbatore has general control over the Nilgiri District as well as his own. The Nilgiris and Coimbatore together have 84 police stations; and the force, in 1904, numbered 1,488 constables and 1,564 rural police, under 20 inspectors. Besides the Coimbatore Central jail, there are 15 subsidiary jails, which can collectively accommodate 270 prisoners.\n\nAccording to the Census of 1901 Coimbatore stands twelfth among the Districts of the Presidency in the literacy of its population, of\nwhom 5.1 per cent. (9.7 males and 6.6 females) are able to read and write. Education is most advanced in Coimbatore, and most backward in the Satyamangalam, Kollegal, and Bhavani taluks. The total number of pupils under instruction in 1880-1 was 12,485; in 1890-1, 26,946; in 1900-1, 39,724; and in 1903-4, 39,559. On March 31, 1904, there were 1,065 primary, 30 secondary, and 5 special schools, besides 2 colleges. The girls in these numbered 4,341. Besides the public schools, 179 private schools contained 3,172 male and 408 female scholars. Of the 1,102 institutions classed as public, 8 were managed by the Educational department, 193 by the local boards, and 12 by municipalities, while 574 were aided from public funds, and 405 were unaided but conformed to the rules of the department. The enormous majority of the pupils under instruction are only in primary classes, and the number of girls who have advanced beyond that stage is extremely small. The improvement in all directions during the last thirty years has, however, been very marked. Of the male population of school-going age 18 per cent. were in the primary stage of instruction in 1903-4, and of the female population of the same age 3 per cent. Among Musalmans (who, however, form a very small proportion of the population) the corresponding percentages were 76 and 9. About 2,700 Panchama pupils were under instruction at 111 schools especially maintained for depressed castes. The two colleges are in Coimbatore city, to which place will also be moved shortly the College of Agriculture of the Province, now located at Saidapet. The total expenditure on education in 1903-4 was Rs. 2,94,000, of which Rs. 1,11,000 was derived from fees. Of the total more than half was devoted to primary education.\n\nThe District possesses 12 hospitals and 12 dispensaries, with accommodation for 132 in-patients. In 1903 the number of cases treated was 220,000, of whom 1,500 were in-patients, and 7,400 operations were performed. The expenditure was Rs. 54,000, the greater part of which was met from Local and municipal funds.\n\nIn regard to vaccination the District has been backward of late years, but during 1903-4 the number of persons successfully vaccinated was 28 per 1,000, or only a little less than the mean for the Presidency (30). Vaccination is compulsory in the three municipalities and in 15 of the 21 Unions.\n\n[Sir F. Nicholson, *District Manual* (1887), and H. A. Stuart, Revised edition (1898).]\n\n**Coimbatore Subdivision.**\u2014Subdivision of Coimbatore District, Madras, consisting of the taluks of Coimbatore and Satyamangalam.\n\n**Coimbatore Taluk.**\u2014Western taluk of the District of the same name, Madras, lying between 10\u00b0 49' and 11\u00b0 24' N. and 76\u00b0 39' and 77\u00b0 10' E., with an area of 812 square miles. The population in 1901\nwas 330,684, compared with 307,282 in 1891. The taluk contains one town, Coimbatore (population, 53,080), the head-quarters of the taluk and the District; and 263 villages. The demand for land revenue and cesses in 1903-4 amounted to Rs. 4,29,000. The taluk is flanked on the west by the Nilgiri Hills, numerous outliers from which run down into it on that side, but on the east it consists of an open plateau with a very pleasant climate. One-fourth of it is covered with forest. Irrigation is chiefly from the Noyil river, which passes through the centre, but it is also known for its tanks. Six-sevenths of the 'dry' land is red sand or red loam of a good kind. As in the other northern and western taluks, cholam is the chief crop, though cambu also is grown, and a considerable quantity of cotton.\n\nCoimbatore City (Koyamuttir).\u2014Head-quarters of the District and taluk of the same name, Madras, situated in 11\u00b0 N. and 76\u00b0 58' E., on the left bank of the Noyil river, and on the trunk road from Madras City to Calicut, 305 miles from the former by the Madras Railway. The population in 1872 was 35,310; in 1881, 38,967; in 1891, 46,383; and in 1901, 53,080. It is thus a rapidly growing place, and now ranks tenth among the towns of the Province. About 85 per cent. of the inhabitants are Hindus, Musalmans numbering 4,129 and Christians 3,869.\n\nDuring the wars with Haidar Ali and Tipu, Coimbatore, from its position commanding both the Palghat Gap leading to Malabar and the Gazalhatti pass to Mysore, was of great strategical importance. It was taken by the British in 1768, but was almost immediately lost again, the Muhammadan commandant treacherously murdering the British officers and handing it over to Haidar. In 1783 it surrendered to Colonel Fullarton, but was shortly afterwards restored to Tipu on the eve of the Treaty of Mangalore. On the reopening of hostilities in 1790 it was retaken by the British. The year after, Tipu sent 2,000 regulars with guns and a considerable body of irregulars to regain it. The siege which followed is the most memorable event in its history. The fort was energetically and successfully defended against the first investing force by Lieutenant Chalmers (afterwards Major-General Sir John Chalmers, K.C.B.) and a young Frenchman named Migot de la Combe, with a small force of 120 topasses and 200 Travancore sepoys, of whom the majority either deserted or proved extremely insubordinate. Tipu then sent a second force of 8,000 regulars with fourteen guns and a large number of irregulars and cavalry under Kamar-ud-din, his most famous general, to avenge the repulse. The garrison had meanwhile been strengthened by reinforcements under Lieutenant Nash, and numbered 700 men. A weak relieving force from Palghat was beaten back, and eventually, both Chalmers and Nash being wounded, the place was surrendered (October, 1791) on\ncondition that the garrison should be allowed to retire unmolested to P\u00e1lgh\u00e1t. Tip\u00fb, however, violated these terms and sent Chalmers and Nash as prisoners to Seringapatam\\(^1\\). A couple of months later the British once more reoccupied Coimbatore, but in 1792 it was again restored to Tip\u00fb. In 1799 the British captured it yet again, and were finally confirmed in possession by the fall of Seringapatam in the same year. It was made the capital of the District in 1865.\n\nCoimbatore is now one of the most desirable stations in the Presidency. Situated 1,300 feet above the sea, in a picturesque position at the mouth of the Bolampatti valley, with the masses of the Nilgiris and the Anaimalais rising into view on either side, its light annual rainfall of 22 inches and its moderate mean temperature render it at once healthy and pleasant. It is the head-quarters of the ordinary District staff; and also of a Conservator of Forests, a Deputy-Inspector-General of Police, a Superintending Engineer, an Inspector of Schools, and a company of the Nilgiri Volunteer rifles. One of the seven Central jails of the Presidency is also located here. This was completed in 1868 and has accommodation for 1,340 prisoners. The convicts are largely employed in weaving, their average annual out-turn being 420,000 yards of cotton fabrics, worth Rs. 92,000, most of which is khaki or white drill made for the army or civil departments. The city further contains the cathedral of the Bishop of the French Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Missions \u00c9trang\u00e8res, and the head-quarters of the London and the Leipzig Evangelical Lutheran Missions working in the District.\n\nCoimbatore was constituted a municipality in 1866. During the ten years ending 1903 the municipal receipts and expenditure averaged Rs. 50,000. In 1903-4 the income was Rs. 76,000, chiefly derived from the house and land taxes (Rs. 16,500) and tolls (Rs. 12,000); while the expenditure was Rs. 79,000, including conservancy (Rs. 40,000), roads and buildings (Rs. 11,000), and the municipal hospital, which contains beds for 40 in-patients (Rs. 8,000). The outlay on conservancy was abnormal owing to the appearance of plague, and was partly met by a contribution from Government. A water-supply scheme is under investigation, of which the approximate cost is estimated at 3.3 lakhs.\n\nCoimbatore is also the industrial and educational centre of the District. It contains a steam cotton-press; a cotton-spinning mill, which has 20,000 spindles, employs nearly 1,000 hands daily, and turns out some 850 tons of yarn; a tannery, which employs 240 persons and produces 200 tons of leather worth 6 lakhs; two steam coffee-curing works, which employ 400 hands and treat coffee worth 12 lakhs, mostly from the Salem Shevaroys; a steam factory, in which manure is made from blood, bones, and oilseeds; some works where coffee is roasted\n\n\\(^1\\) For further details of the two sieges, see Wilson's History of the Madras Army, vol. ii, pp. 212-6 (Madras, 1882).\nand ground for consumption; and a saltpetre refinery. All these are under European management, but in addition a distillery and a sugar factory owned by natives produce 62,000 gallons of spirit and 440 tons of sugar respectively.\n\nThe chief educational institutions are the Coimbatore and St. Michael's Colleges, both of the second grade. The former was established in 1852 by Mr. E. B. Thomas, then Collector of the District, and is managed by a committee of residents. In 1903-4 it had an average attendance of 525 boys, of whom 67 were reading in the F.A. classes. The latter began in 1860 as a small school established by the French Roman Catholic Mission, and was affiliated to the University in 1891. Its average attendance in 1903-4 was 440, and there were 39 boys in the F.A. classes. The College of Agriculture, now located at Saidapet in Chingleput District, will shortly be moved to Coimbatore; and a forest school, for the training of deputy-rangers and foresters, has been opened.\n\nColair Lake (Kollery or Kol\u0101r).\u2014This, the only large natural fresh-water lake in the Madras Presidency, lies in Kistna District between 16\u00b0 32' and 16\u00b0 47' N. and 81\u00b0 4' and 81\u00b0 23' E. Half lake, half swamp, it is a great shallow depression, roughly elliptical in shape, which was doubtless originally part of the Bay of Bengal. On either side of it the great rivers God\u0101v\u0101ri and Kistna pushed their deltas farther and farther out into the sea, until the southward extremity of the one joined the northward limit of the other, and the arm of land thus formed cut off the Colair depression from the salt water. The streams which flow into it now keep its waters fresh, but the silt they carry is rapidly filling it up and in course of time it will inevitably disappear. The extent of the Colair Lake varies greatly. During the monsoon it exceeds 100 square miles, but in the dry season it shrinks considerably, and sometimes, as in the drought of 1900, the lake dries up altogether. Reclamations and embankments are annually reducing its dimensions.\n\nTo the north of it, from 20 to 50 miles away, lie the highlands of the Eastern Gh\u0101ts, and the drainage from about 2,000 square miles of these is passed into the lake by three mountain torrents called the Budimeru, the Tamileru, and the Weyyeru. This water leaves the lake by two outlets known as the Perantala Kanama and Juvir Kanama, and passes into the tidal stream of the Upputeru ('salt river'), which conveys it to the sea. Local legends say that the Upputeru was cut to drain the lake by an army which was endeavouring to capture the fort of Kolleti Kota on one of its islands, but was hampered by the depth of the water; and that Perantala Kanama was named after the daughter of the general, who was sacrificed by her father to ensure the success of his attack.\nThe Colair Lake is fairly well stocked with fish and abounds in water-fowl of every description. A regular export trade in bird-skins existed at one time, but the birds were so mercilessly pursued that they have greatly decreased in numbers. In the lake are many fertile and highly cultivated islands, which are included in 26 villages. The cultivation in these (over 10,000 acres) is watered from the delta channels of the Kistna river; but the cultivators own no proprietary rights in their lands, holding them on annual leases which may be revoked if any scheme of irrigation necessitates such a course.\n\nColeroon (Kollidam).\u2014Northern arm of the Cauvery river, which branches off from the main stream about 9 miles west of Trichinopoly. For 17 miles it runs parallel to the Cauvery, and then turns towards and very nearly reunites with it. The island thus formed is called the island of Srirangam, and lies in Trichinopoly District. At the lower end of the island the Coleroon takes a north-easterly course, skirts the District of Tanjore on the north, and falls into the sea near Devikottai. The waters of the Coleroon are largely utilized for irrigation. Across the head, where it branches from the Cauvery, stands the Upper Anicut, a dam constructed between 1836 and 1838 to prevent the Coleroon, which runs in a lower bed than the Cauvery, from abstracting too much of the water, and so injuring the irrigation in Tanjore dependent on the main stream. The Grand Anicut, built by the Chola kings, a few miles lower down at the point where the Cauvery and Coleroon nearly meet again, serves a similar purpose. The object of these works is noticed at greater length in the article on the Cauvery. About 70 miles below the Upper Anicut, the Lower Anicut again dams up the Coleroon, for the purpose of providing irrigation in South Arcot District and a portion of Tanjore. The trunk road from Kumbakonam to Madras passes over this dam. The Vadav\u0101r and North R\u0101ja channels lead from it into South Arcot, while the South R\u0101ja channel turns into Tanjore. The Lower Anicut system in 1903-4 irrigated 134 square miles in South Arcot, yielding a revenue of more than 4 lakhs, and 37 square miles in Tanjore, the revenue from which was nearly another lakh. The South Indian Railway crosses the river about 10 miles above its mouth by a girder bridge. A few yards higher up, a masonry bridge until recently carried one of the main roads. Half of the piers fell during the floods of November, 1903, and at present a ferry is supplying its place. The Coleroon is navigable by light craft for a few miles from its mouth, and is used to a small extent for the export of rice. It is altogether 94 miles in length, and drains an area estimated at 1,404 square miles.\n\nColgong (Kalag\u0101on).\u2014Town in the head-quarters subdivision of Bh\u0101galpur District, Bengal, situated in 25\u00b0 16' N. and 87\u00b0 14' E., on the south bank of the Ganges and on the East Indian Railway, 245 miles\nfrom Calcutta. Population (1901), 5,738. Ghiy\u0101s-ud-d\u012bn Mahm\u016bd, the last independent king of Bengal, died here in 1539 after the sack of Gaur. There is a rock temple of peculiar style, which formerly contained several fine specimens of sculpture, and the place appears to have been visited by the Chinese pilgrim Hiuen Tsang. It is of some commercial importance and was once notorious as the resort of thugs. Colgong was constituted a municipality in 1869. The income and expenditure during the decade ending 1901-2 averaged Rs. 5,000. In 1903-4 the income was Rs. 5,500, mainly from a tax on houses and lands; and the expenditure was Rs. 6,000. A scheme for the drainage of the town is under consideration.\n\n[Archaeological Survey Reports, vol. xv, pp. 34-6.]\n\nColleg\u0101l.\u2014Subdivision, taluk, and town in Coimbatore District, Madras. See Koll\u0113g\u0101l.\n\nColonelganj.\u2014Town in the Tarabganj tahsil of Gond\u0101 District, United Provinces, situated in 27\u00b0 8' N. and 81\u00b0 42' E., on the Bengal and North-Western Railway. Population (1901), 6,817. In 1780 the village of Sikrora (Secrora) became a cantonment, at which the Naw\u0101b of Oudh stationed troops under a British officer to restrain the turbulent R\u0101j\u0101s north of the Gogra. Another force was sent in 1802, and a bazar, named Colonelganj, was then founded. This was selected on annexation as the head-quarters of troops; and when the Mutiny broke out the English officers escaped with some difficulty to Balrampur, where they were protected. After the suppression of the rebellion, Colonelganj ceased to be a cantonment. The town is administered under Act XX of 1856, with an income of about Rs. 2,600. There is a flourishing export trade in rice, maize, and oilseeds. A dispensary is maintained here, and the American Methodist Mission has a branch. There is a school with 155 pupils.\n\nCombaconum.\u2014Subdivision, taluk, and town in Tanjore District, Madras. See Kum\u0101konam.\n\nComercolly.\u2014Town in Nadia District, Bengal. See Kum\u0101rkh\u0101l\u012b.\n\nComilla Subdivision.\u2014Head-quarters subdivision of Tippera District, Eastern Bengal and Assam, lying between 23\u00b0 3' and 23\u00b0 48' N. and 90\u00b0 38' and 91\u00b0 22' E., with an area of 1,142 square miles. The greater portion of the subdivision is a level alluvial plain broken only by the L\u0101lm\u0101i hills, 5 miles to the west of Comilla town; on the east this plain is bounded by the low jungle-clad hills of Hill Tippera. The population in 1901 was 957,699, compared with 821,285 in 1891. The density was 839 persons per square mile. The subdivision contains one town, Comilla (19,169), the head-quarters; and 2,939 villages.\n\nComilla Town (Kumill\u0101).\u2014Head-quarters of Tippera District, Eastern Bengal and Assam, situated in 23\u00b0 28' N. and 91\u00b0 11' E., on the Gumti river, on the main road from Dacca to Chittagong. Popu-\nlation (1901), 19,169. Comilla was constituted a municipality in 1864. The income during the decade ending 1901-2 averaged Rs. 22,500, and the expenditure Rs. 21,000. In 1903-4 the income was Rs. 30,000, of which Rs. 9,000 was derived from a tax on persons (or property tax), and Rs. 7,000 from a conservancy rate; and the expenditure was Rs. 27,000. The town is protected from inundation by an embankment along the bank of the Gumti, which is maintained by the Raja of Hill Tippera. The Dharmasagar is a splendid tank, a mile in circumference, which was constructed by a Raja of Tippera in the fifteenth century. Comilla contains an English church, the usual public offices, including a jail with accommodation for 308 prisoners, a second-grade Arts college under private management, and one Government and two private schools teaching up to the entrance examination. An artisan school was established by the District board in 1890, which is affiliated to the Sibpur Engineering College.\n\nComorin (Kanniy\u0101kum\u0101ri).\u2014Village, shrine, and headland in the Agastiswaram taluk of Travancore State, Madras, situated in 8\u00b0 5' N. and 77\u00b0 33' E. It is the extreme southern point of the Indian Peninsula, from which the chain of the Western Ghats runs northwards. Population (1901), 2,368. On the sea-shore and at the apex, as it were, of the Indian Peninsula stands the temple of Kanniyambal, or 'the virgin goddess,' celebrated for its sanctity. It is one of the most important places of pilgrimage in Southern India. In the Periplus, reference is made to a harbour, but none exists now. Ordinary sailing vessels frequently touch here, however, and the State authorities contemplate making it a port. It contains a palace of the Maharaja and one of the Residencies in Travancore.\n\nCondavid.\u2014Historic fort in Guntur District, Madras. See Konavidi.\n\nConjeeveram Taluk.\u2014Westernmost taluk of Chingleput District, Madras, lying between 12\u00b0 42' and 13\u00b0 8' N. and 79\u00b0 34' and 80\u00b0 5' E., with an area of 514 square miles. The population in 1901 was 225,300, compared with 218,671 in 1891, the rate of increase being smaller than in any other taluk. It is the only part of the District in which the females are in excess of the males. There are two towns, Conjeeveram (population, 46,164), the head-quarters, and Sriperumbudur (5,481), the station of a deputy-tahsildar; and 364 villages. Of these last, Perambakkam possesses some historical interest. The demand on account of land revenue and cesses in 1903-4 amounted to Rs. 5,08,000. The soil of the taluk is generally very inferior, being either stony or mixed with lime, gravel, or laterite. Its general appearance is tame and dreary in the extreme, there being only one or two low conical hills in the north-east. The general level rises gradually but considerably from the river Palar towards the north and west.\nAlong the northern bank of this river, palmyra, coco-nut, and tamarind trees have been largely planted. It is the chief source of irrigation, but the Korttalaiy\u0101r also furnishes a supply to a few villages in the north-west. The water from the P\u0101l\u0101r is led either by direct flow from the river or by spring channels dug on both banks. A channel called the Kambakkal also takes off at the dam which has been built across the river in North Arcot District to supply the K\u0101verip\u0101k tank. This flows along a ridge on the western and northern sides of the t\u0101huk, and fills chains of tanks\u2014sometimes two, three, and four in number\u2014on each side of its course.\n\nConjeeeveram Town (K\u0101nchipuram).\u2014Head-quarters of the t\u0101huk of the same name in Chingleput District, Madras, situated in $12^\\circ 50' N.$ and $79^\\circ 42' E.$, 45 miles west-south-west of Madras City on the branch line between Arkonam and Chingleput. It had a population in 1901 of 46,164: namely, 44,684 Hindus, 1,313 Musalm\u0101ns, 49 Christians, and 118 Jains. The real name of the town is K\u0101nchi or K\u0101nchipuram, and the English form is merely a corruption of this. It is one of the most ancient towns in Southern India, and in the early centuries of the Christian era was the capital of the dynasty of the Pallavas. In the seventh century Hiuen Tsiang, the Chinese pilgrim, visited it; and he says the city was 6 miles in circumference and the people in it superior in bravery and piety, as well as in their love of justice and veneration for learning, to many others whom he met with in his travels. Jains were very numerous in his day, and Buddhists and Br\u0101hmans of about equal influence. The town passed to the Cholas in the eleventh century. Conjeeeveram became the capital of Tondamandalam, and continued in the hands of the Cholas until they were overthrown by the Musalm\u0101ns of the north in 1310. When the Vijayanagar kings came into power they speedily annexed the town. It was taken from them by the Musalm\u0101ns in 1646; the Mar\u0101th\u0101s succeeded in 1677; they were ousted by Aurangzeb's army shortly after; and it remained in the possession of the Musalm\u0101ns till 1752, when Clive took it from them in the wars with the French. In 1757 the French, beaten off in an attack upon its great temple, set fire to the town. In 1758 the English garrison was temporarily withdrawn on account of the expected advance of the French upon Madras, but was soon sent back with reinforcements; and during the siege of the capital and the subsequent wars the place played an important part.\n\nConjeeeveram is now accounted by Hindus as one of the holiest places in the South, and it is indeed placed among the seven sacred cities of India. It is crowded with temples and shrines. The old Jain temple is situated in the hamlet of Tirupparuttikunram, about 2 miles south of the weaver quarter of Conjeeeveram, called Pillap\u0101laiyam. Its florid architecture and the artistic merit of some of the details, notably\nof the sculptures in the cloistered court which surrounds it, and of the colouring of the paintings on the ceilings, lead to the assumption\u2014confirmed by inscriptions on the walls\u2014that it belongs to the period when the Chola power was at its zenith. The Vijayanagar monarchs made several grants of land to this temple during the fourteenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth centuries. The inscriptions are very valuable for historical purposes, as they appear to commemorate gifts by almost the entire succession of dynasties who held the country for any length of time. The Vaikuntha Perumal temple of Vishnu and the Saiva temple of Kailasan\u0101thar appear from inscriptions to have been built by the Pallava kings. Two others were built about 1502 by Krishna Deva, the greatest of the Vijayanagar rulers, and many of the smaller shrines and resthouses are due to the piety of members of the same dynasty. The great temple has tall towers, a hall of 1,000 columns, several large and fine porches, and great tanks with flights of stone steps. But these are all thrown together as if by accident, and form no consistent plan. Fergusson says that in it 'no two gopurams [towers] are opposite one another, no two walls parallel, and there is hardly a right angle in the place. All this creates a picturesqueness of effect seldom surpassed in these temples, but deprives it of that dignity we might expect from such parts if properly arranged.' The Varadar\u0101ja-sw\u0101mi Vaishnava temple is notorious for the bitter disputes which occur between the Tengalai and Vadagalai sub-sects who are connected with its worship. These have been going on for a century or more, and the litigation regarding them has proceeded as far as the Privy Council. Decisions have been given, but the interpretation to be placed upon these still gives occasion for threatened breaches of the peace.\n\nConjeeveram was constituted a municipality in 1866. The receipts and the expenditure during the ten years ending 1902\u20133 averaged Rs. 86,000 and Rs. 77,000 respectively. In 1903\u20134 the income was Rs. 59,000, mostly derived from the taxes on houses and land and the water rate; and the expenditure was Rs. 54,000. A scheme for the supply of good drinking-water was begun in 1895\u20136, and completed in two years at a total cost of Rs. 2,56,000. The water is obtained from the subterranean springs of the Vegavati river, in the bed of which an infiltration gallery, 330 feet long, 12 feet deep, and 8 feet broad, has been constructed. The water flows into a reservoir built at the end of the gallery, and thence passes into a well through a steel pipe. From this well it is pumped into the town by two steam engines which are worked by turns. They are capable of supplying 840,000 gallons of water daily, but the actual consumption is only about half of this quantity. The annual cost of the establishment maintained is Rs. 2,600. Superior s\u0101r\u0131s of silk and cotton such as native women wear are made at Conjeeveram.\nConolly Canal.\u2014Canal in the Calicut taluk of Malabar District, Madras. The canal proper, which was constructed by Mr. Conolly, Collector in 1848, consists of a cutting about 3 miles in length, running through Calicut city and connecting the Elattur or Korapula and Kallayi rivers. It thus forms part of the line of water communication from Badagara to Reypore.\n\nContai Subdivision (Kanthi).\u2014Southern subdivision of Midnapore District, Bengal, lying between 21\u00b0 36' and 22\u00b0 11' N. and 87\u00b0 25' and 87\u00b0 59' E., with an area of 849 square miles. The subdivision is a tract lying along the sea-coast, swampy and liable to inundation. The population in 1901 was 603,136, compared with 545,358 in 1891, the density being 710 persons per square mile. It contains 2,062 villages, including Contai, its head-quarters, but no town. This is the most progressive part of the District. The population increased by 10.6 per cent during the decade ending 1901, immigrants crowding to the newly reclaimed lands, known as jalpai or 'fuel-lands,' so called because they formerly supplied the fuel for boiling brine when the landholders manufactured salt.\n\nContai Village (Kanthi).\u2014Head-quarters of the subdivision of the same name in Midnapore District, Bengal, situated in 21\u00b0 47' N. and 87\u00b0 46' E. Population (1901), 2,558. The place has declined since the manufacture of salt was stopped about forty years ago. It contains the usual public offices; the sub-jail has accommodation for 15 prisoners.\n\nCooch Behar State (Kuch Bihar).\u2014Feudatory State in North Bengal, lying between 25\u00b0 58' and 26\u00b0 32' N. and 88\u00b0 45' and 89\u00b0 52' E., with an area of 1,307 square miles. It is bounded on the north by the District of Jalpaiguri; on the east by Goalpara; on the south by Rangpur; and on the west by Rangpur and Jalpaiguri.\n\nCooch Behar is a low-lying plain, the whole of which has at one time or another been subject to fluvial action. It is intersected by several large rivers; but they are of no use for drainage purposes, except in the cold season, when they are at their lowest, and even then the fall is so small that they are not very effective. Moreover, any attempt to cut drainage channels to them would lead in the rains to an inundation, rather than to the drainage of the area they might be constructed to serve. The State generally is, in fact, hopelessly waterlogged, and during the rains it is not uncommon to see the wells overflowing. The general direction of the rivers is from the north-west to the south-east; they rise in the Himalayas and fall into the main stream of the Brahmaputra. The most important are the Tista on the west and the Sankosh on the east, while between these two are situated the Dharla, the Torsa, the Kaljani, the Raidak, and other minor streams. The Tista enters the State within a few miles of its western boundary and flows in a south-easterly direction.\nfor about 15 miles, when it passes into Rangpur. The Jaldh\u0101k\u0101, which is called in Bhutan the Di-chu, enters the State at the north-west corner and flows more or less parallel to the Tista. It receives as tributaries the Gil\u0101ndi, Duduy\u0101, Mujn\u0101i, and\u2014later during its course when it is called the Mansai\u2014the Satang\u0101, Dolang, and Dharl\u0101; after its junction with the river last named it assumes the name of Singim\u0101ri. It is finally joined by the old channel of the Tors\u0101, locally called the Dharl\u0101, under which name the united stream leaves the State, after a course of about 60 miles within it with an average breadth of 400 to 500 yards throughout. It is shallow in the dry season, but is liable to heavy floods during the rains. The Tors\u0101 bifurcates in its course, one branch flowing south under the name of Dharl\u0101 and falling into the Singim\u0101ri (Jaldh\u0101k\u0101), while the other turns eastward and falls into the K\u0101lj\u0101ni. The K\u0101lj\u0101ni in its turn meets the Raid\u0101k, which subsequently joins the Gad\u0101dhar; and the united river falls into the Brahmaputra by two mouths, the southern one being known as the Dudhkum\u0101r and the northern as the Sankosh.\n\nThe soil is everywhere alluvial. Where the ground is not occupied by the usual crops of North Bengal, it is covered with an abundant natural vegetation. Old river-beds, ponds, marshes, and streams with a sluggish current have a copious vegetation of Vallisneria and other plants. Land subject to inundation has usually a covering of Tamarix and reedy grasses; and in some parts, where the ground is more or less marshy, Rosa intorturata is plentiful. Few trees occur on these inundated lands; the most plentiful and largest is Barringtonia acutangula. On the higher ground also the trees are few and usually rather stunted, and the greater portion of the surface is covered with grasses, the commonest of these being Imperata arundinacea and Andropogon aciculatus. Among the trees the most conspicuous is the red cotton-tree (Bombax malabaricum); the siss\u016b (Dalbergia Sissoo) and the mango occur as planted or sometimes self-sown species, bamboos grow in profusion, and palms, especially the areca, are common. Near villages there are usually thickets or shrubberies and more or less useful trees of a rapid growth and weedy character. A few tracts are maintained as shooting reserves, but these consist mainly of grass jungle, and there is no real forest.\n\nThe big game with which the State formerly abounded has receded northwards before the advance of cultivation, and within its limits the only wild animals now found are leopards, bears, deer, and hog. Of small game, florican and francolin are plentiful in some of the grassy plains.\n\nThe temperature is rarely excessive, the thermometer never rising above 93\u00b0 in the shade and seldom so high, but the abnormal humidity makes the climate very trying and unpleasant. The lowest recorded\ntemperature is $49^\\circ$ and the mean about $78^\\circ$. The annual rainfall averages 123 inches, of which 5-1 are received in April, 14 in May, 29-4 in June, 24 in July, 22-4 in August, 19-4 in September, and 5-5 in October.\n\nIn 1887 a severe cyclonic storm caused great havoc over a tract 25 miles in length and 8 in breadth, including Cooch Behar town. The earthquake of 1897 caused enormous damage to property. The bridges along the railway were broken and the permanent way was much cut up by fissures; roads with their bridges suffered similarly, and the total damage done to property, communications, wells, and tanks was approximately 20 lakhs. Tremors and shocks were frequent for a year after the main upheaval, during which jets of hot water and sand issued from the fissures. Prior to 1897 the severest and most frequent shocks of recent years were felt in 1885. Dr. Buchanan Hamilton makes mention of the frequency of earthquakes in this part of Bengal in 1868. The State has occasionally suffered severely from floods, the most memorable being those of 1787, 1822, 1842, and 1878.\n\nThis tract once formed part of the ancient and famous kingdom of Kamarupa. In the fifteenth century it was ruled by a dynasty of Khen kings, the last of whom, Nilambar, was overthrown by the Afghans under Ala-ud-din Husain, king of Gaur, History. in 1498. Local traditions of this dynasty are still current, and more than one of its capitals are pointed out at the present day. Ala-ud-din appointed his son governor over Nilambar's territories with the object of pushing his conquest farther east, but the latter was eventually defeated and his troops driven out of the country. A period of anarchy ensued, during which a number of petty principalities were formed by independent local rulers called Bhuiyas, and a fresh kingdom was then established by the Kochs. A divine parentage is ascribed to the Koch kings: the tradition is that the god Siva fell in love with Hir\u0101, the wife of a Koch chief named H\u0101jo, and the result of their intimacy was a boy named Bisu or Biswa Singh. The account current in the State, however, is that the kingdom was founded in 1510 by a chief named Chandan, and that he was succeeded by his cousin, Biswa Singh. The latter soon proved himself to be a mighty conqueror, and brought under his rule the whole tract from the Karatoya on the west to the Barnadi on the east. He was succeeded about 1540 by his son Nar Narayan, the greatest of the Koch kings, who, with the aid of his brother Silarai, conquered all the neighbouring countries to the east and south, and even ventured to wage war with the Muhammadans. After Silarai's death, his son Raghu rebelled (in 1581), whereupon Nar Narayan divided his kingdom into two parts and gave up to Raghu the portion east of the Sankosh river. This event soon led to the downfall of the Koch kings. Nar Narayan died in 1584; and his son, Lakshmi Narayan, who\nsucceeded him, having quarrelled with Raghu's son, Parikshit, invoked\nthe aid of the Mughals and declared himself a vassal of the emperor of\nDelhi. The history of the Koch kings now loses all general interest.\nThe eastern kingdom was gradually absorbed by the Ahoms, while the\nwestern was shorn of its outlying possessions by the Mughals on the\nsouth and west and by the Bhoti\u0101s on the north, until at last only\nthe modern State of Cooch Beh\u0101r remained in the precarious possession\nof Biswa Singh's descendants. Internal affairs also fell into deplor-\nable confusion. In accordance with the curse of the Hindu political\nsystem, three families, all scions of the royal stock, the Nazir Deo, the\nDiw\u0101n Deo, and the Raikat of Baikuntpur, each claimed an hereditary\nposition which was inconsistent with unity of administration, and did\nnot hesitate to call in the foreign foe to support their pretensions.\n\nIt was under these circumstances that the attention of the East India\nCompany was first attracted to Cooch Beh\u0101r and its affairs. In 1772,\nthe Nazir Deo having been driven out of the country by his rivals, who\nwere aided by the Bhoti\u0101s, and the R\u0101j\u0101 having fled to P\u0101ng\u0101, the\nformer applied for assistance to Warren Hastings, then Governor of\nBengal. A detachment of sepoys was accordingly marched into Cooch\nBeh\u0101r, and the Bhoti\u0101s were expelled after a short resistance and forced\nto sue for peace through the intervention of the Lama of Tibet. The\ntreaty between the East India Company and the R\u0101j\u0101 of Cooch Beh\u0101r\nmade on this occasion bears date April 5, 1773. By the third clause\nthe R\u0101j\u0101 acknowledged subjection to the East India Company and con-\nsented to his country being annexed to the Province of Bengal. This\nright of annexation was, however, eventually waived by the Govern-\nment. In subsequent clauses the R\u0101j\u0101 promised to make over one-half\nof his annual revenues, according to an assessment to be made by\nthe Company. This moiety was permanently fixed by the Collector\nof Rangpur in 1780 at Rs. 67,700. Fresh domestic dissensions soon\nreduced the administration to a deplorable condition, and in 1788 a\nCommission of two Civil Servants was nominated to inquire into the\nstate of the country. The Commissioners concluded their report by re-\ncommending the appointment of a Resident or Commissioner at the\ntown of Cooch Beh\u0101r. This office subsequently became merged in that\nof Governor-General's Agent for the North-East Frontier. The present\nMah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101, His Highness Colonel Sir Nripendra Narayan Bh\u016bp Bah\u0101dur,\nG.C.I.E., C.B., was placed on the gaddi on August 6, 1863, when he was\nonly ten months old. In January, 1864, the succession was sanctioned\nby Government, but a British Commissioner was appointed to undertake\nthe direct management of affairs during the minority of the young ruler.\nSeveral salutary reforms were thus introduced: a complete survey and\nsettlement was made, and the various departments of the State were put\nupon the firm and substantial basis which underlies the present system\nof administration. The Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101 received a wholly European training and education, and has at various times visited England. In 1878 he married the eldest daughter of the great religious reformer Keshab Chandra Sen, and in 1883 he assumed charge of the State. He took part in the Tirah campaign in 1897 and is an aide-de-camp to the King-Emperor. The Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101 is entitled to a salute of 13 guns.\n\nRuins of an old city founded by R\u0101j\u0101 Niladhwaj exist at Kam\u0101t\u0101pur.\n\nThe population increased from 532,565 in 1872 to 602,624 in 1881, a gain of 13\u00b71 per cent., but most of this was apparently due to improved methods of enumeration. Ten years later it fell to 578,868, owing mainly to the unhealthiness of the climate and, to a smaller extent, to emigration. In 1901 a further decline of 2\u00b705 per cent. took place, the population decreasing to 566,974. The only th\u0101na in which an increase occurred was Haldib\u0101ri, the principal centre of the jute trade. This is on the Eastern Bengal State Railway, and enjoys with Cooch Beh\u0101r town the reputation of being the healthiest portion of the State. The falling off was greatest in the head-quarters th\u0101na, where it was due not only to unhealthiness, but also to migration to Fulb\u0101ri. The State is liable to very severe epidemics of cholera. Insanity is more common than elsewhere in Bengal, and deaf-mutism and leprosy are also prevalent. The population is contained in 1,192 villages and four towns: Cooch Beh\u0101r, the head-quarters, M\u0101t\u0101bh\u0101nga, Haldib\u0101ri, and Dinhat\u0101. The villages are not compact as in most parts of Bengal, but each farmer ordinarily lives apart in a separate homestead on his own land surrounded by his farm servants and adherents. The average number of persons per square mile in 1901 was 434, the density being greatest in the south. There is some immigration from S\u0101ran and other Bih\u0101r Districts and the United Provinces. The vernacular of the State is the Rangpuri or R\u0101jbansi dialect of Bengali. Hindus number 397,946, or more than 70 per cent. of the total population, and Musalm\u0101ns 168,236, or most of the remainder.\n\nThe R\u0101jbansi or Kochs (338,000) are the distinctive caste of the State, forming 60 per cent. of the total, while most of the Nasyas (43,000) and Shaikhs (124,000) represent descendants of converts from this caste to Muhammadanism. Though the Kochs freely call themselves R\u0101jbansi, it is believed (see Bengal Census Report, 1901, part i, pp. 382\u20133) that the two communities originally sprang from entirely different sources, the Kochs being of Mongoloid origin, while the R\u0101jbansi are a Dravidian tribe who probably owned the name long before the Koch kings rose to power. In Cooch Beh\u0101r the persons now known as R\u0101jbansi are either pure Kochs, who though dark have a distinctly Mongoloid physiognomy, or else a mixed breed in which the Koch element usually predominates. The population is almost\nentirely agricultural, 86.5 per cent. being dependent on agriculture for their livelihood, 4.9 per cent. on industries, and 1.4 per cent. on the professions.\n\nChristians number 143, of whom 74 are natives. A Swedish mission called the Scandinavian Alliance Mission works in Cooch Behar town, but has made no local converts.\n\nThe soil is of alluvial formation, with a large admixture of sand and a substantial deposit of light loam to a depth of about two feet. Towards the west the soil is stiffer and contains a larger proportion of clay than sand. High-lying lands are used mainly for homesteads or for tobacco cultivation and, to a certain extent, where they contain a good admixture of sand, for the cultivation of the bitari or spring rice crop. On low-lying lands, possessing a smaller proportion of sand, haimantik or autumn rice is usually grown.\n\nIn 1903-4 the net area cropped was 638 square miles, 159 square miles were current fallow, 295 were cultivable waste other than fallow, and 199 were not available for cultivation, while 15 square miles were under forest. Of the net cropped area, 26 square miles were estimated to be twice cropped. By far the most important staple is rice, of which there are two crops; the bitari or early crop is sown broadcast, while the haimantik, or late one is transplanted. Other food-crops are chani, kaon, maize, and various pulses, including ming, masur, khesari, thakari, hurthi, and rahar. Oilseeds, principally mustard, are extensively cultivated. The local tobacco, which is grown on 55 square miles, is a very important crop and has a high reputation. Burma cheroots are usually manufactured from tobacco grown in Cooch Behar and the adjoining British Districts. Jute is grown on 34 square miles; and that grown in Haldibari and Chaurahat is of exceptionally good quality and commands a high price in the Calcutta market.\n\nThe cultivation of sugar-cane has been only recently introduced, but is increasing. Cultivation generally is extending, but cultivators are averse to the adoption of new methods; the only manure used is cow-dung for the tobacco crop.\n\nThere is no dearth of pasturage, but the local cattle are of a very small and inferior breed. The State keeps some bulls for breeding purposes, but the crossing of heavy imported bulls with the light local cattle has not proved a success. Large numbers of cattle yearly die from rinderpest, and a veterinary officer has recently been appointed to perform inoculations in the localities chiefly affected. Bullocks for draft purposes are imported in numbers from Sonpur and elsewhere, and sold at fairs at Haldibari and Chaurahat.\n\nThe State contains innumerable tanks, besides 40 masonry wells, 85 Ranganj pipe-wells, and 30 tube-wells; but for irrigation it depends entirely on its heavy rainfall. Famine is unknown.\nA rough cloth is prepared from the silk of the *end\u012b* worm, which is fed on the castor-oil plant. Coarse cotton fabrics are woven for local use, and the Garo and Mech women make cloths of variegated colours for their own wear. A considerable amount of excellent gunny cloth is made, especially in Mekhliganj; this locality was once noted for the manufacture of coloured carpets and curtains woven from pure jute and known as *mekhli*, but the industry is dying out. Ghi and mustard oil are made in large quantities, and molasses to a limited extent in the west and south.\n\nThe chief exports are tobacco, jute, rice, mustard seed and mustard oil; and the chief imports are cotton piece-goods, kerosene oil, sugar, molasses, salt, and brass, copper, and earthenware utensils. Jute and rice are exported from all parts of the State, the baled jute going mainly to Calcutta and the unbaled to Sirajganj. The tobacco trade is chiefly in the hands of Magh merchants, who pay yearly visits to Mekhl\u012bganj and L\u0101l Bazar and purchase almost the entire crop for export to Burma. Several European jute firms are established at Haldib\u0101r\u012b and Chaur\u0101h\u0101t, but otherwise most of the trade is in the hands of M\u0101rw\u0101ri merchants. Some tobacco, mustard seed, and mustard oil are sent down by water to Dacca. Rice is largely exported to the tea gardens in the Du\u0101rs and sometimes by boat to Sirajganj. The railway extension in the State has recently given considerable impetus to both the jute and tobacco trade, though the M\u0101rw\u0101ri and other native traders still prefer the river routes to the railway.\n\nThe Cooch Beh\u0101r State Railway (2 feet 6 inches gauge) runs from Gitald\u0101ha junction, where it connects with the Eastern Bengal State Railway system, to Jaintia at the foot of the Bhutan hills; its total length is $53\\frac{1}{2}$ miles, of which $33\\frac{1}{2}$ lie within the State. The new extension of the Eastern Bengal State Railway from Mughal H\u0101t to Dhubri runs through the south-east of the State for a distance of 12 miles, and on the west the northern section of the line runs for a distance of $5\\frac{1}{4}$ miles. A short section ($2\\frac{1}{4}$ miles) of the Bengal-Du\u0101r Railway from Barnes Gh\u0101t to L\u0101manir H\u0101t also lies within the State. These three lines are all on the metre gauge. The State contains $38\\frac{1}{2}$ miles of road, of which $5\\frac{1}{2}$ miles in Cooch Beh\u0101r town are metalled; there are also $187$ miles of village tracks. The most important roads are the emigration road which runs eastward through the State to Dhubri, passing through Haldib\u0101r\u012b, Mekhl\u012bganj, P\u0101tgr\u0101m, M\u0101t\u0101bh\u0101nga, and Cooch Beh\u0101r town, and the Buxa and Rangpur roads.\n\nThe Tista is navigable by boats of 3 or 4 tons burden throughout the year. The Jaldh\u0101k\u0101 is navigable by boats of 7 tons burden up to the junction of the Mujn\u0101i, whilst boats of smaller tonnage can go as far as F\u0101l\u0101k\u0101ta in Jalpaiguri District. The Kalj\u0101ni is a deep stream\nand carries a considerable river traffic; boats of 7 to 11 tons come up all the year round, and timber from the Western Du\u0101rs is floated in considerable quantities down this river to the Brahmaputra from Alipur. The most important ferry is that over the Tista river.\n\nFor administrative purposes the State is divided into five subdivisions: Cooch Beh\u0101r, Dmh\u0101ta, M\u0101t\u0101bh\u0101nga, Mekhliganj, and Tufanganj. At the head of the administration is the State Council, which consists of His Highness the M\u0101h\u0101r\u0101ja Bh\u016bp Bah\u0101dur as president, the Superintendent of the State as vice-president, the Diw\u0101n as revenue member, and the Civil and Sessions Judge as judicial member. In judicial matters the powers of the High Court have been delegated to it, while in revenue matters it sits as a Board of Revenue; it exercises also legislative and executive powers.\n\nThe Superintendent of the State, who is an officer lent by the British Government, is the executive head of criminal justice, police, jail, education, public works, and other minor departments. The Diw\u0101n is in charge of the revenue department, being responsible for the collection of all kinds of revenue and the supervision of all proceedings in connexion with it; he exercises the powers of a Collector in a British District, and in some cases those of a Commissioner. The subdivisions are in charge of na\u012bb ahlk\u0101rs; the head-quarters na\u012bb ahlk\u0101r is the general assistant of the Diw\u0101n in executive matters and also holds charge of the State treasury. Below the na\u012bb ahlk\u0101rs is a grade of sub-na\u012bb ahlk\u0101rs, whose powers are similar to those of Sub-Deputy-Magistrate-Collectors in Bengal. The na\u012bb ahlk\u0101rs and sub-na\u012bb ahlk\u0101rs are assisted by divisional k\u012bnungos, who are employed on survey and inquiry work.\n\nThe principal courts are the State Council, which is the highest appellate court in all branches of judicial administration, the courts of the Civil and Sessions Judge, the Faujd\u0101ri Ahlk\u0101r, and the Assistant Sessions Judge. On the criminal side the Civil and Sessions Judge exercises all the powers vested in a Sessions Judge according to the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code, except that under the rules of the State capital punishment is never resorted to. In his civil capacity he discharges the functions of a District Judge, as defined by the Civil Procedure Code. An appeal lies to him from the decisions of the Assistant Civil Judges, na\u012bb and sub-na\u012bb ahlk\u0101rs. He is also ex-officio registrar of deeds. The Faujd\u0101ri Ahlk\u0101r exercises the powers of a District Magistrate, as defined in the Criminal Procedure Code; he is also in charge of the jail. The powers of the Assistant Civil Judges extend in the Cooch Beh\u0101r subdivision to title suits, suits ordinarily dealt with by a Small Cause court, and rent suits of which the value does not exceed Rs. 1,000, and in the other subdivisions to title suits of which the value exceeds Rs. 500, but is not above\nRs. 1,000. The naib and the sub-naib ahlikars have both civil and criminal jurisdiction; the former exercise the powers of subdivisional officers as defined in the Criminal Procedure Code, and the latter are second or third-class magistrates, as the case may be. The naib ahlikars are also sub-registrars, and exercise powers extending to all title suits up to the value of Rs. 500 and to all rent suits and suits of a Small Cause court nature up to the value of Rs. 1,000. The sub-naib ahlikars exercise jurisdiction in title suits up to the value of Rs. 50, and in rent suits and suits of a Small Cause court nature up to the value of Rs. 100, each in his respective subdivision. In criminal matters they are subordinate to the Faujdari Ahlikar, and on the civil side to the Civil Judge.\n\nThe total revenue under the main heads amounted in 1903-4 to 23.29 lakhs, of which 13.66 lakhs was derived from land revenue, 1.52 lakhs from stamps, 1.11 lakhs from excise and opium, 1.39 lakhs from the Cooch Behar State Railway, 4.91 lakhs from the Maharaja's estates outside Cooch Behar, and Rs. 69,000 from other sources. The receipts under the same heads in 1880-1, 1890-1, and 1900-1 were 12.95, 18.00, and 22.55 lakhs respectively. The Cooch Behar State Railway had not been constructed in the two first years.\n\nThere is very little information as to the land revenue arrangements before the State came into contact with the British in 1773. At that time revenue was collected by the State officers direct from the joddars or persons holding revenue-paying estates under the State, but in 1790 the collection of the revenue was entrusted to ijadaridars or farmers. The system was unsatisfactory and resulted in a great deal of oppression, and during the minority of the present Maharaja the State was completely surveyed and settlement was made direct with the joddars; the operations were concluded in 1877, and the demand was then fixed at 9.39 lakhs. A subsequent resettlement of the State concluded in 1897 raised the demand to 12.41 lakhs, the increase being distributed over five years; the term of this settlement will expire in 1917-8. In addition, a few permanently settled estates pay an annual revenue of Rs. 7,000. A comparatively small quantity of land is held revenue-free or on service tenures. The joddars pay the State a revenue assessed according to the rates fixed for lands which have been measured and classified; their holdings are heritable and transferable, and are liable to be sold summarily for arrears of revenue. They can also be resumed by the State on the violation of the terms of the lease or for a public purpose, compensation being paid in the case of temporarily settled estates for standing crops and homesteads, while a fair and equitable price is paid or an exchange of land is made in the case of permanently settled estates. Below the joddars are several grades of under-tenures known successively as chukinis, dar-chukinis, daradar-chukinis, tasya-chukinis, tali-chukinis, and tasya-tali-chukinis.\nAt the time of the settlement it was found that the average area of a jot was 37 acres, of a chuk\u0101ni holding 7 acres, of a dar-chuk\u0101ni 5 acres, and of a daradar-chuk\u0101ni \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) acres, while the lower grade holdings averaged between \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) and \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) acres. The quantity of land held on an average by the jotd\u0101r and not sublet to under-tenants is 10 acres.\n\nThe rates per acre for cultivated land payable by the jotd\u0101rs vary from Rs. 1\u201314 to Rs. 3 for low lands, and from 15 annas to Rs. 1\u201311 for high lands other than garden and homestead lands and lands on which the valuable betel-nut and tobacco crops are grown, for which special rates are fixed. The chuk\u0101ni rates are 35 per cent. in excess of the jot rates; and where there are other holders below the chuk\u0101nid\u0101r, the cultivating ryot pays a rate of 60 per cent. in excess of the jot rate, the profit of 25 per cent. being divided between the chuk\u0101nid\u0101r and any other intermediate middlemen.\n\nThe administration of excise is conducted on the same principles as those adopted in British territory. The State has its own excise department, each subdivision is an excise circle, and the out-still system has been introduced. The greater portion of the excise revenue is derived from the duty and licence fees on g\u0101nja and hemp drugs; next in importance come the receipts from the sale of country spirit; and a considerable amount is also realized from the duty and licence fees on opium. Poppy was formerly grown and opium manufactured in the State; but in 1867 the cultivation of poppy was prohibited, on the British Government agreeing to supply opium at cost price. The cultivation of g\u0101nja has also been stopped, and the drug is obtained from the British District of R\u0101jsh\u0101hi. The stamp revenue is collected under special Acts passed by the State Council. It is mainly derived from judicial documentary and court-fee stamps; copying-fee stamps and receipt stamps form a minor source of income. The stamps last mentioned have only been in use since 1903. No customs or transit dues are levied, and there is no tax on salt.\n\nAt Cooch Beh\u0101r town and the subdivisional headquarters of Din-h\u0101ta and M\u0101t\u0101bh\u0101nga, and at Haldib\u0101ri in the Mekhliganj subdivision, there are town committees appointed by the State, consisting of official and non-official members in the proportion of two to one; subject to the general control of the Council, the management of all matters ordinarily entrusted to municipalities rests in the hands of these bodies. The funds administered by the town committees are derived mainly from chaukid\u0101ri and latrine taxes, supplemented by State grants.\n\nThe maintenance of the Mah\u0101r\u0101ja's palace and of all public buildings and communications is in the hands of a Public Works department. The average annual outlay of the department is about 13 lakhs, of which about Rs. 50,000 is devoted to the maintenance of communications.\nThe State employs 156 sepoys and sowars of all ranks for guard, orderly, and escort duties; these are under the command of the Superintendent of the State.\n\nThe State contains 7 police stations or th\u0101nas. The strength of the force subordinate to the Superintendent of Police consists of 2 inspectors, 11 sub-inspectors, 24 head constables, and 262 constables, in addition to a rural and municipal police numbering respectively 1,571 and 43. The annual cost of the maintenance of the force averages Rs. 53,000, and the proportion of police to population is 1 to 4,079. The jail at Cooch Behar town has accommodation for 189 prisoners, in addition to which there are lock-ups at the other subdivisional head-quarters.\n\nEducation has made considerable progress in recent years, and the number of persons able to read and write more than doubled between 1881 and 1901; in the latter year 5.9 per cent. of the population (10.7 males and 9.4 females) were returned as literate. The number of pupils under instruction increased from 10,194 in 1892-3 to 12,670 in 1901-2, in which year 26.2 per cent. of the boys and 0.36 per cent. of the girls of school-going age were at school. In 1903-4 there were altogether 12,639 pupils under instruction, and the number of educational institutions was 333, including one Arts college, 43 secondary schools, 37 night schools, and 9 girls' schools. The expenditure on education was Rs. 79,000, of which Rs. 44,000 was contributed by the State, the remainder being derived from fees and subscriptions. The principal institutions are the Victoria College and the State high school in Cooch Behar town, and eight high schools at M\u0101\u1e6d\u0101bh\u0101\u1e45ga, Mekhtiganj, and Dinh\u0101ta. The control of educational matters rests with the Superintendent, who is assisted by an inspector and deputy-inspector of schools and circle pandits.\n\nThe medical charge of the State is in the hands of a European Civil Surgeon, who has under him an assistant surgeon and a large staff of native doctors and compounders. The State contains (1903-4) 9 dispensaries, of which 8 have accommodation for in-patients, the most important being the hospital at Cooch Behar town with 36 beds. At all these institutions the cases of 25,000 out-patients and 1,000 in-patients were treated during the year, and 907 operations were performed. The cost of their maintenance was Rs. 34,000, all of which, except a small sum derived from the sale of medicines, was borne by the State.\n\nThe annual number of vaccinations has been slowly increasing, and 24,044 operations were performed in 1903-4; under recent legislation vaccination may be made compulsory within affected areas by notification in the State Gazette.\n\n[Sir W.
