On Wednesday evening Mr. Brannan, agent to the Mint, accompanied by some policemen, proceeded to the above house and seized the prisoners, and the articles named. Mr. Knox remanded all the prisoners.\n\nSHOCKING ACCIDENT.\u2014On Saturday two men named Henry Watson, 60, and William Burgess, 27, were attended at St. Thomas's hospital, suffering from very serious injuries. It appears that on Wednesday the injured men were riding upon a van in the Old Kent-road, when from some unexplained cause an omnibus came into such violent contact with the van that they were thrown off with very great violence. Burgess fell upon his head, and the poor fellow was picked up senseless. The other man fell in such a position as to have the wheels of the bus pass over his back and right arm, the latter being fractured in two places. Both men remain in a very dangerous condition.\n\nATROCIOUS ATTEMPT BY A SERVANT GIRL.\u2014At the Norwich assizes, on Friday, Hannah Willimot, domestic servant, 16, was charged with administering poison to her employer's infant, eight days old. The prisoner put some phosphate paste into the child's mouth apparently with a view to prevent the increase of her work. Fortunately the nurse discovered the attempt, and wiped the child's mouth in time to prevent serious injury. The jury found her \"Guilty\" of misdemeanor, but recommended her to mercy; and she was sentenced to six months' imprisonment.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3206236091.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 1384, "total-output-tokens": 454, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 1889, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
