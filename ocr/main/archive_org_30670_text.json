Cunningham, Barrister-at-Law. Notes on certain points have been supplied by district officers; while the report on the Census of 1881 has been utilised. Of the present volume, Section A of Cap. V (General Administration), has been for the most part supplied by the Deputy Commissioner; Section A of Cap. III (Statistics of Population) has been mainly taken from the Census Report; while here and there, passages have been extracted from Mr. Cunningham's compilation already referred to. But, with these exceptions, the great mass of the text has been taken almost, if not quite verbally, from Mr. T. G. Walker's Settlement Report of the district.\n\nThe draft edition of this Gazetteer has been revised by Col. Gurdon, and Messrs. Walker and Wakefield, and by the Irrigation Department so far as regards the canals of the district. The Deputy Commissioner is responsible for the spelling of vernacular names, which has been fixed throughout by him in accordance with the prescribed system of transliteration. The final edition, though completely compiled by the Editor, was prepared for press, with the exception of Chapters V and VI, by the late Mr. Stack; while the whole of it has been passed through the press by Mr. Walker.\n\nTHE EDITOR.\nCONTENTS.\n\nCHAP.

The main portion of the district lies between $30^\\circ 33'$ and $31^\\circ 1'$ North Latitude and $75^\\circ 25'$ and $76^\\circ 27'$ East Longitude, and has for its northern boundary the river Sutlej, across which it faces the Jullundur Do\u00e1b. To the east it adjoins the Umballa, and to the west the Ferozepore districts, while to the south it is separated from those of the Delhi and Hissar divisions by the tract of country which is partitioned between the Chiefs of Pati\u00e1la, Jind, N\u00e1bha, and M\u00e1ler Kotla. To the north, east and west the boundaries are fairly symmetrical, but to the south the district is cut into by the territories of the Chiefs named above. The political history of our acquisitions in these parts will account for the unscientific nature of the boundary on this side, and also for our having to retain a number of detached villages stretching as far south as $30^\\circ 5'$; while two or three groups of Pati\u00e1la villages lie surrounded by those of the Samr\u00e1la tahsil. The continuous portion of the district has a length along the river of nearly 60 miles; while the breadth, north and south, is about 24 miles, except where Pati\u00e1la territory juts into it between the Ludhi\u00e1na and Samr\u00e1la tahsils.\n\nThe district is divided into three tahsils\u2014Samr\u00e1la to the east, Jagraon to the west, and Ludhi\u00e1na in the middle. Some leading statistics regarding the district and the several tahsils into which it is divided are given in Table No. I on the opposite page. The district contains two towns with a population of more than 10,000 souls, as follows:\n\n| Town       | Population |\n|------------|------------|\n| Ludhi\u00e1na   | 44,163     |\n| Jagraon    | 16,873     |\n\nThe administrative head-quarters are located at the town of Ludhi\u00e1na, situated in the centre of its northern border on the Sindh-Punjab Railway, and six miles from the bank of the Sutlej. Ludhi\u00e1na stands 29th in order of area and 15th in order of population among the 32 districts of the Province, comprising 1\u00b729 per cent. of the total area, 3\u00b729 per cent. of the total population, and 3\u00b740 per cent. of the urban population of British territory.\n\nIt includes 914 villages, with an average area of 966 acres for each village. Notwithstanding its limited area the district is one of the most important in the province, paying between 11 and 12 lakhs of rupees in land revenue, and having a population of more than half-a-million. If we exclude the outlying villages, it is probably more compact and convenient for administrative purposes than any other district, the remotest point being not much more than 30\nmiles from head-quarters, and access to almost every part being easy by rail, or by the good roads which run in all directions. The outlying villages number 39, and have an area of 125 square miles.\n\nThe latitude, longitude and height in feet above the sea of the principal places in the district are shown below:\n\n| Town     | N. Latitude | E. Longitude | Feet above sea level |\n|----------|-------------|--------------|----------------------|\n| Ludhiana | 30\u00b0 55'     | 75\u00b0 54'      | 806                  |\n| Jagraon  | 30\u00b0 47'     | 75\u00b0 31'      | 761                  |\n| Samrala  | 30\u00b0 45'     | 76\u00b0 8'       | 870*                 |\n\nNatural divisions: B\u00e9t and Dh\u00e1ia.\n\nThe district has no very striking natural features. The main physical divisions are the same as those of most Punjab plain districts, i.e., a low-lying alluvial tract along the river (here called B\u00e9t), and the uplands (called Dh\u00e1ia).\n\nThe river Sutlej.\n\nThe river Sutlej forms, as stated before, the northern boundary of the district. Debouching from the Siwaliks just above R\u00fapar, some 25 miles east of the boundary of the Samr\u00e1la tahsil, it flows due west along the top of the district for a distance of about 60 miles, and turns, as it leaves the Jagraon tahsil, slightly to the north towards its junction with the Beas. Even when at its lowest, in the middle of the cold weather, the river has a considerable volume of water, the main stream being generally 100 to 200 yards in width, and seven or eight feet in depth. Some of the people living on the banks are able to ford it when very low, but even to them this is attended with danger. When in flood it spreads over the country to a width generally of two or three miles; and, even where confined by the Phillour Bridge Works to its narrowest, it measures nearly a mile of running stream. The bridges and ferries are noticed in Chapter IV (page 163).\n\nLike all Punjab rivers the Sutlej is constantly shifting its course in the floods of the hot weather, as there is nothing to keep it to one bed. Within the last 30 years we know that it has moved about four or five miles northwards in the first few miles of its course in this district; and there can be no doubt that within a not very distant period (local accounts say 100 years) it flowed just under the ridge which separates the Dh\u00e1ia or highlands from the B\u00e9t, the older towns and villages like Bahlolpur, Machiw\u00e1ra, Kum, &c., having been built on its banks. The division between uplands and lowlands is everywhere marked distinctly by this ridge or high bank (Dha); and between it and the present course of the river lies the B\u00e9t tract. To the east of the district the river and the high bank are five or six miles from each other; and this distance is maintained for the first 30 miles; but below the town of Ludhiana they gradually approach until in the Jagraon tahsil the B\u00e9t is only one or two miles in width, and finally disappears.\n\nImmediately under the high bank along what was once the course of the Sutlej now runs a perennial stream called the Budha N\u00e1la, which takes its rise in some springs near Chamkor in the\n\n* Approximate.\nR\u00fapar tahsil of Umballa, and enters this district under Bahlolpur. Passing just below the town of Ludhi\u00e1na, it flows into the Sutlej in tahsil Jagraon, a few miles east of the Ferozepore border. When swollen by floods in the rains it has a considerable volume of water and covers the country about; but ordinarily the actual stream is only a few yards across, although there is in places a good deal of swamp about it. The water, except in the floods, is perfectly clear, and is used freely by the people for drinking purposes, but never for irrigation. The reason for this is that it is said to contain a large infusion of salts, but in any case it would have to be lifted to the fields; and, with the water level only eight or ten feet below the surface, it is as easy to dig small unlined wells where they are wanted.\n\nIn the Samr\u00e1la tahsil a good deal of injury is done to what would be valuable land by the spread of swamp, the stream being only slightly below the level of the country, and all land within a short distance of it is injuriously affected by percolation. To the west the banks are high and the land is cultivated right up to them. In the cold weather the Budha can be crossed on foot at certain points which are well known to the people; but generally the bottom is treacherous, and in the floods of the rainy season even at these fords the water is too deep for wading. There is a bridge at Ludhi\u00e1na on the Jullundur road; and there was one just under Machiw\u00e1r\u00e1, which was a great convenience, but has been allowed to go to ruin. The result is that in the floods the people of the B\u00e9t are almost entirely cut off from the rest of the district. The floods do not last very long, being caused by rainfall in the plains only.\n\nIn the immediate vicinity of the river is a strip of land liable to annual inundation and called mand or kachcha, and in this we see the soil of the B\u00e9t in process of formation. Something occurs to divert the force of the river from a certain point; and, when the floods subside, a shallow deposit of silt is found covering what was before an expanse of sand. The accumulation of silt goes on for a year or two, being assisted by the growth of dib grass (Eragrostis cynosuroides), which is generally followed by pilchi called here jh\u00e1o (Tamarix orientalis). When the deposit is about six inches in depth, the land becomes capable of yielding crops; and it is gradually reclaimed by being put through a regular course of cultivation. The formation of a deposit is by no means a uniform operation. A few years may leave three feet of first-rate soil, or the deposit may remain so shallow as to make cultivation scarcely worth while; and one often sees apparently good land abandoned by the people after a trial. The action of the Sutlej in this way appears to be mostly beneficial. The mand tract of the first 20 or 30 miles is probably one of the richest pieces of land in the country, and with the very slightest labour magnificent crops are raised in what is really virgin soil. Lower down to the very end of the district the silt is also most fertilizing, although the crops are generally of an inferior class. The river is of course a very powerful and capricious agent, and the saying \"Ek s\u00e1l am\u00edr, ek s\u00e1l faq\u00edr\" is applicable to the inhabitants of this as of any other riverain tract. The poor cultivator may find, when the floods have subsided, that a piece of barren sand has taken the place of his fertile fields; and that he owns no land that will yield him\nany thing. In the older or pucka B\u00e9t the process of formation has ceased long ago; but there are abundant traces of it. High ridges of river sand occur, and the deposit of soil is generally three to five feet in depth, though in places the sand actually appears on the surface or is just concealed by a coating of soil. The soil of the mand is generally a stiff, moist loam of dark colour; and that of the pucka B\u00e9t of the same character, but drier and of a lighter tint, the proportion of clay being considerable. There is a great difference between the produce of the first 10 or 15 miles of the B\u00e9t and that of the lower parts, but this is perhaps due to the heavier rainfall in the former rather than to anything in the quality of the land. The B\u00e9t is everywhere cut up by streams, which convey the drainage to the river. In the rains these overflow their banks and flood the country; but they are mostly dry for the rest of the year. In such a damp tract it was to be expected that in places impeded underground drainage should produce kollar or soil so impregnated with salts as to be barren. There is some of this along the Budha N\u00e1la, but not much elsewhere. Saline efflorescence appears here and there all over the B\u00e9t, and patches of cultivated land will be found in which the salts have prevented the growth of the crop; but the evil is not widespread. It is worst about Nurpur in Ludhi\u00e1na and in the adjoining part of Jagraon B\u00e9t, where the course of the drainage is in places away from the river, and the water oozes out just under the high bank.\n\nFrom the high bank the Dh\u00e1\u00eda or upland part of the district stretches to the south in a plain, the uniformity of which is unbroken by hill or stream. The surface is perfectly level, except in the immediate neighbourhood of the high bank, or where a sand ridge occurs. There is a very gentle slope from north-east to south-west, Drainage lines, R\u00e1os, at right angles to the Siw\u00e1l\u00edks, and the lines of drainage follow this. In the neighbourhood of the high bank, the rainfall is all absorbed by the light soil; but further inland there are some very well defined drainage lines, locally known as r\u00e1o, which, in a year of heavy rain, carry a considerable body of water along the depressions which they have apparently worn for themselves. Some of these r\u00e1os can be traced from one end of the district to the other, and have most of them been carefully recorded by the Canal Department. They are a cause of complaint to the villages lying on them, as they do considerable injury to the crops, and often destroy wells. This is the whole extent of the harm done by them, for, even where the flow of water is partially impeded by the embankments of the Grand Trunk Road, the Railway, Canal, &c., there is never anything approaching to swamp.\n\nIn the neighbourhood of the high bank the surface is uneven, and the upper soil is a poor light sand, shifting under every wind, and blown into hillocks. There is a good subsoil, however, and this will account for the very fair crops that are raised out of what appears little better than a wilderness. This light sandy tract extends inland for four or five miles, the surface getting gradually more even, and the soil improving. South of it in the main portion of the uplands, every variety of soil will be found, from a very stiff clay to the lightest of sand. In the half of the district east of the M\u00e1ler Kotla\nroad the prevailing soil is a stiff loam of darkish colour, with a good deal of clay in it, while to the west of this road a much larger portion of the area is light loam or sand. But everywhere sand occurs, being confined in the Samr\u0101la tahsil to two very clearly marked belts of two or three miles width, which run in a south-western direction and appear to indicate the course of some old hill-stream or drainage line. Elsewhere, scattered over the district, there are numerous ridges of sand, covering considerable areas, and presenting the appearance of continuity for short distances, while elsewhere detached patches crop up in a manner quite unaccountable. These ridges of sand are most common in the south-western portion of the district about Pakhow\u00e1l, in tahsil Jagraon and in the Jangal or detached villages. They rise in places to a height of 20 or 30 feet, and especially in the Jangal, where they occur most frequently, quite shut in the view and give the country an undulating appearance.\n\nThere are no very well-recognized subdivisions of the uplands. Minor subdivisions of the Dh\u00e1\u00eda.\n\nThe B\u00e9t people talk of the whole as Dh\u00e1\u00eda though they will sometimes refer to the Jangal country as something beyond the Dh\u00e1\u00eda. The people of the eastern portion speak of the whole tract to the south-west of the district, including our detached villages and part of Jagraon tahsil with the Pati\u00e1la and other territories, as Jangal. They talk of it as a country where, although the rainfall is scanty, the produce of the unirrigated crops is very fine; where the land is new and there is plenty of it; where, instead of the constant drudgery necessary under a high system of agriculture, the cultivator has merely to sow his seed, and does what he pleases till harvest time. On the other hand the Jat of the Jangal will compare his sandy fields, where only the coarsest grains can grow, with the rich Paw\u00e1ddh with its sugar, cotton and maize fields, where the produce of a single acre is equal to that of a holding of his land. There is then, if we exclude the narrow sandy strip of land just over the B\u00e9t, which has just been described, and which is uniform along the whole length of the district, this general distribution into the Paw\u00e1ddh, or eastern tract, and the Jangal or south-western. The characteristics of the former, which comprises the high lands of the Samr\u0101la tahsil, and all the part of Ludhi\u00e1na east of the M\u00e1ler Kotla road, are a soil which is generally a fertile loam, rather stiff in places, a high rainfall and a very large proportion of irrigation, with (what is the natural result of this combination) a very highly developed condition of agriculture, all the superior crops being grown. Across the M\u00e1ler Kotla road the soil grows much lighter, and the rainfall less, while well irrigation becomes difficult, and the higher crops disappear (first sugarcane and then cotton), till finally in our outlying villages well irrigation is unknown, the spring level being over 100 feet from the surface, and only the hardiest crops being able to subsist on the scanty moisture. There is, of course, an intermediate tract, and this is sometimes called Tih\u00e1ra, in which would be included most of the Jagraon tahsil, and the country about Pakhow\u00e1l in Ludhi\u00e1na. The people of the Jagraon tahsil speak of the whole country south of the Grand Trunk Road as Jangal or Rohe, reserving the name Dh\u00e1\u00eda for the tract between it and the high bank. This is the most correct use of the latter term, which does generally mean the land just over the Dha.\nTable No. III shows in tenths of an inch the total rainfall registered at each of the rain-gauge stations in the district for each year, from 1866-67 to 1882-83. The fall at head-quarters for the four preceding years is shown in the margin. The distribution of the rainfall throughout the year is shown in Tables Nos. IIIA and IIIB. The three tahsil head-quarters at which the observations have been taken are fairly central, except in the case of Ludhi\u0101na. The following is the result of the observations of 18 years:\n\n| Station | Inches |\n|---------|--------|\n| Samr\u0101la | 27     |\n| Ludhi\u0101na| 27     |\n| Jagraon | 21     |\n\nThe fall varies for the continuous portion of the district from about 30 inches at Sherpur in the north-east corner to less than 20 inches at Hatur in the south-west, a distance of about 55 miles. In the outlying villages the fall is generally about 17 inches, but goes as low as 15, probably, in the extreme south ones.\n\nThe following statement shows the distribution during the years 1869\u201483 of the rainfall at Ludhi\u0101na over the twelve months:\n\n| Months | 1869 | 1870 | 1871 | 1872 | 1873 | 1874 | 1875 | 1876 | 1877 | 1878 | 1879 | 1880 | 1881 | 1882 | Average |\n|--------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|---------|\n| April  |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |         |\n| May    |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |         |\n| June   |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |         |\n| July   |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |         |\n| August |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |         |\n| September |    |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |         |\n| Total 6 months | 20-2 | 17-3 | 13-3 | 42-5 | 33-3 | 14-4 | 33-3 | 10-8 | 22-2 | 28-1 | 12-2 | 19-7 | 20-6 | 10-7 | 21-3 |\n| October |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |         |\n| November |     |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |         |\n| December |     |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |         |\n| January |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |         |\n| February |     |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |         |\n| March   |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |         |\n| Total 6 months | 10-1 | 3-4 | 4-9 | 3-7 | 3-1 | 4-4 | 3-1 | 3-8 | 1-5 | 3-2 | 2-7 | 4-2 | 3-2 | 4-4 | 4-9 |\n| Total 12 months | 30-3 | 19-9 | 18-2 | 46-2 | 28-4 | 19-8 | 36-1 | 14-6 | 37-6 | 30-7 | 14-0 | 23-9 | 23-3 | 15-1 | 20-1 |\n\nOur months do not agree with the seasons understood by the people. The monsoon or rainy season generally begins in the last ten days of June, i.e., the first fifteen days of the native month of H\u0101r, and lasts during July, August and September (H\u0101r, S\u0101wan, Bhadon). The advent of the monsoon is heralded by several days\nof boisterous weather, the wind blowing steadily from the south-east. The land has been parched by more than three months of a blazing tropical sun till there is scarcely a vestige of vegetation left; but with the first fall nature springs into life, and in a few days the face of the country is covered with verdure, grass grows abundantly where it is allowed to, and the autumn crops soon show themselves in the cultivated fields. Rain and sunshine succeed each other at short intervals during the next three months, the breaks of fair weather lasting generally only for a few days. The monsoon rains close at the end of September. There is then generally a slight fall about the time of the Diwali Festival (20th October), fairly heavy rain about Christmas or the New Year, and again at the end of February or beginning of March. The total of the winter (Sid) falls in six months is not equal to that of the single months of July, August, or September; but owing to the lower temperature the effect is much greater on the vegetation.\n\nTable No. IV shows the temperature at head-quarters for the past 14 years. The following is a statement of the temperature during the months of May, July and December, being the average of observations between 1880 and 1882:\n\n| Temperature in the shade in degrees Fahrenheit. |\n|-----------------------------------------------|\n| **May** | **July** | **December** |\n| Maximum | Minimum | Mean | Maximum | Minimum | Mean | Maximum | Minimum | Mean |\n| 103     | 69      | 86   | 94      | 78      | 86   | 74      | 43      | 58   |\n\nIn April the temperature is at first moderate, but towards the end of the month it rises in the daytime. In May and June the sun is very powerful, and the atmosphere hot and dry. The heat is intense, though not worse than in most plain districts, and is not much less during the night than in the day. The first fall of rain brings an immense relief, and somewhat cools the air; and for the next three months rain and strong sun succeed each other, the atmosphere being saturated with moisture, at all events in the upper portions of the district. October has hot days and mild nights; and for the five months following it the air is cool and bracing, the nights of December and January being intensely cold. Chill winds from the north often blow for days in January and February, blighting the crops. In the lower part of the district, and more especially in the Jangal villages, the hot weather begins much earlier, and the air is dry all the year round.\n\nAs might be expected the moist Bet tract is very unhealthy. During the months August to November fever is very prevalent, and in a bad year one can scarcely in October find an able-bodied man not suffering from it. The villages have during this season the appearance of being deserted; and the same answer is returned in\nevery village to one's inquiries as to where the Lambardars are \"t\u00e1p se digi\u00e1\" (he is down with fever). Ludhi\u00e1na and all the towns and villages along the high bank and over the Budha N\u00e1la, are not better off. In M\u00e1chiw\u00e1ra, Bahlolpur, Kum, Bhundri, &c., it is quite part of a man's life to have an attack of fever once in the year. The severity of these attacks varies, but the general result is a weakening of the constitution, which makes the people less able to resist the effects of other ailments; and it will be found that the dwellers in the B\u00e9t and along the high bank are much shortly lived than those of the more inland tracts. In some years the fever is of a bad type, and then it plays havoc with the people. Mr. Davidson, the former Settlement Officer, speaks in his report of being frightened away from Kum by the number of dead bodies brought out for burial while he was there in camp. In 1878 there was a terrific mortality amongst the Kashmiris and other half-starved members of the lower classes in the city of Ludhi\u00e1na and also in the villages. The civil station is by no means a desirable residence during the months of September and October; but one appears to get away from the influence of the malaria by going even a short distance inland. The most healthy portion of the district is the south-west corner about Bassian and the Jangal villages, where the climate is always dry and the water much purer. The people of these parts are generally exempt even from fever, and enjoy excellent health. The district cannot claim any special diseases as prevailing. Phthisis and mania are the most common. Neither Ludhi\u00e1na nor any one of the other towns has suffered from an epidemic of cholera since that of 1872; and such visitations are rare. The prevalence of ophthalmia has probably been exaggerated.\n\nThe Civil Surgeon writes: \"The chief diseases of the Ludhi\u00e1na district are due to malarious poison, enlargement of the spleen and anemia being very prevalent. Pulmonary consumption is very common in the town of Ludhi\u00e1na, and although it attacks all classes, the foreign colonies located here are the principal victims, viz., the Kashmiris and Path\u00e1ns. The disease amongst the Kashmiris is certainly intensified by their employment in shawl-weaving, although the real cause must be attributed to the climate chiefly, which does not agree with the people of more temperate regions. There is no endemic disease peculiar to the district, the same diseases prevailing as in other parts of the Punjab, namely, fevers, pneumonia which is frequently epidemic, and diseases of the bowels, dysentery and diarrhoea.\"\n\nTables Nos. XI, XIA, XIB, and XLIV give annual and monthly statistics of births and deaths for the district and for its towns during the last five years; while the birth and death rates since 1868, so far as available, will be found at page 46 for the general population, and in Chapter VI under the heads of the several large towns of the district. Table No. XII shows the number of insane, blind, deaf-mutes, and lepers as ascertained at the census of 1881; while Table No. XXXVIII shows the working of the dispensaries since 1877.\nSECTION B.\u2014GEOLOGY, FAUNA AND FLORA.\n\nOur knowledge of Indian geology is as yet so general in its nature, and so little has been done in the Punjab in the way of detailed geological investigation, that it is impossible to discuss the local geology of separate districts. But a sketch of the geology of the province as a whole has been most kindly furnished by Mr. Medlicott, Superintendent of the Geological Survey of India, and is published in extenso in the Provincial Volume of the Gazetteer Series, and also as a separate pamphlet.\n\nThe only mineral product of the district is kankar, which is quarried in many places, and is to be found in sufficient quantity and at so convenient sites that there is no difficulty in obtaining a supply for all the metalled roads and for lime. Saltpetre used to be made in a few villages; but the manufacture has been given up.\n\nIt is not to be expected that in such a highly cultivated district there should be much room for the spontaneous growth of trees or shrubs. There are in some villages of the Bet small plantations of kikar, &c., reserved by the people. In the uplands, even at the last Settlement, there was little natural growth in the uncultivated lands; and since then the cultivation has absorbed most of the waste that was left. In a very few villages in the upper part of the district there is a small area still left under dhak (Butea frondosa), forests of which must at one time have covered the face of the country. This tree requires a good deal of rain and a hard soil, so that it is not to be found in the south-west of the district and in the outlying villages; but in those parts there is a comparatively much larger area of waste still unbroken, and covered with the hardier jand (Prosopis spicigera), karil (Capparis aphylla), &c. It is doubtful there will be much growth of any sort left in ten years, for already, since the new assessments were announced, the people have begun to bring the remaining waste under the plough. Trees (generally kikar and b\u00e9r) are scattered about the fields and line the village roads, or are to be found round the village site; and the general result, except in the light-soiled villages to the south-west, is to give one looking across the country the impression of its being well-wooded. The Government roads have in places along them fine avenues of all sorts of trees (shisham, siris, &c.), and in a few years the canal also will have a very good show. Besides this there are two considerable plantations under the Forest Department, one in the Civil Station and one on the Phillour road near the river. The Malaudh Sardars have two or three pieces of Bir or forest in the neighbourhood of Malaudh and of Sahna; and these cover a good deal of ground. The following is a list of the more common trees of spontaneous growth to be found in the district:\n\n| Vernacular or Local Name | Botanical Name | Remarks |\n|--------------------------|---------------|---------|\n| Kikar                    | Acacia arabica | Grows in most parts of the district, but best in the east. Affects a stiff soil, and likes rain, but is very hardy. It is the zamindar's tree par excellence, being most useful for all agricultural purposes and roofing. |\n### Chapter I, B.\n\n#### Geology, Fauna and Flora.\n\n**Flora: Trees.**\n\n| Vernacular or Local Name | Botanical Name | Remarks |\n|--------------------------|---------------|---------|\n| B\u00e9t, Beri...              | Zizyphus jujuba | Grows in most parts of the Dh\u00e1\u00eda, and does well in sandy soil. Useful for its fruit, and also for its wood for roofing. Is planted in groves as a protection against sand drifts. |\n| Pipal: Barota or Bar     | Ficus religiosa; Ficus indica | Grow in all parts of the Dh\u00e1\u00eda, where planted; generally on the edge of the village pond; useful for shade only. |\n| Pilkan                   | Ficus venosa   | Takes the place of the above in the B\u00e9t; grown for shade. |\n| Farw\u00e1h or Far\u00e1h          | Tamarix orientalis | Grows very generally where planted in the B\u00e9t, mostly round the village site; also, but more rarely, in the uplands. Useful for roofing. |\n| Sh\u00e9b\u00e1m                   | Dalbergia siete | Grown along roads, &c., by Government. |\n| Phul\u00e1i                   | Acacia modesta | Grown in B\u00e9t and Dh\u00e1\u00eda, often in groves; wood is useful for roofing, making doors, &c. |\n| Dh\u00e9k or Bak\u00e1in           | Melia sempervirens | Planted at the wells in the B\u00e9t; grows very fast, and wood useful for roofing. The Ar\u00e1ins and Saints usually grow the tree round their wells for its shade. |\n| Nim                      | Azadirachta indica | A good tree for shade; not very common, and growing by itself both in B\u00e9t and Dh\u00e1\u00eda. Wood is useful. |\n| T\u00e9t                      | Merus          | As above; wood is useful. |\n| Dh\u00e1k, Jand and Karli     | Butea frondosa; Prosopis spicigera; Capparis aphylla | Jangal trees (see above in the text.) |\n| Kaimb                    |               | There are one or two groves of this tree, which is useful only for shade. |\n\nIt is not necessary to give a detailed list of the various fruit trees to be found in the gardens about the city and elsewhere, as these are the usual ones of the Punjab plains. Oranges and loquats seem to do best; but the district is a bad one for fruit.\n\nIn newly formed land along the river is to be found the usual growth of pilchi (*Tamarix orientalis*) here known as *jha\u00f3*. It is very useful for making baskets, and for lining temporary wells. There is also an abundant growth of *dib* grass (*Eragrostis cynosuroides*), of which chit\u00e1i or matting is made; and in places of a plant called *kahi* which, when young and tender, is used for fodder, and when old hardens into a reed, used to make an inferior sort of pen. In the Budha there is a weed called *j\u00e1la*, which is very largely used in clarifying sugar.\n\n*Sarkanda* (*Saccharum moonga*) generally called *Sarv\u00e1r*, grows in many places of the Dh\u00e1\u00eda, and is largely planted along roads, and where there are sand hills, with a view to stop the drift, which it does more or less effectually. The various uses to which this grass is put need not be detailed. There is a regular system of cultivating it. The year's crop is cut down in March or April, and fire applied to the stumps with a view of promoting fresh growth. It begins to spring immediately after the rains, and attains a height of ten feet or upwards. Large sums are realized by the sale of what is grown along the Government roads; and in places round Ludhi\u00e1na it is found profitable to give up the cultivation of inferior sandy\nsoils and to plant this. There is a small shrub called *jh\u00e1re*, which deserves special mention for its usefulness. It is a small, prickly bush, which grows in abundance in the waste land of most villages; and, as it is called *mallah* in the *Jangal*, it is probably the same as the wild *b\u00e9r* (*Zizyphus nummularia*). Twice in the year the growth in the village common land is cut, and the produce most carefully divided according to the proprietors' shares. When dry it is beaten with sticks and tossed with a pitchfork (*salang*), and the leaves thus separated from the branches, which make a most excellent hedge that will keep out anything. The leaves are given to the cattle as fodder, either alone or mixed with straw, and are said to be most strengthening. *Ak* (*Calotropis procera*) grows all over the district in the fields, and is cut down for firewood as fast as it appears.\n\nThe principal weeds that grow amongst the cultivation are *pidzi*, *kasumbhi* and *tehi*. The two first are so named from their resemblance to the onion and the safflower, and the last is the common field thistle. They all three flourish throughout the district; but the *B\u00e9t* soil appears to suit them best. *Pidzi* does the most harm, and a great part of the cultivator's time is taken up in rooting it out of his fields. The process is not attended with much success in the *B\u00e9t* and in Muhammadan villages elsewhere, and one often sees a field of wheat completely killed down by it. It appears to be impossible to clear land of the weed altogether, for there is a fresh growth every year; and, if left alone, it would very soon cover the fields. Other less common weeds are *b\u00e1lh\u00fa*, *chauri saroch*, *jaunchi*, *harmal*, *barru*.\n\nThe domestic animals will be appropriately mentioned elsewhere. The following very complete lists of the large mammals, the game birds, venomous snakes, and fishes commonly found in the district, was supplied to the Settlement Officer by Mr. F. Field, who, in addition to an extensive knowledge of natural history, had a minute acquaintance with the district. During the past five years, rewards to the amount of Rs. 241 have been paid for the destruction of 82 wolves and 5 snakes:\n\n**List of the larger mammals found in the Ludhiana District.**\n\n| Name, English and Hindustani | Scientific Name | Habitat, &c. |\n|-----------------------------|----------------|--------------|\n| The Otter (H.

Saha, Sayar, Khargosh). | *Lepus rufocaudatus* | ... |\n| The Wild Pig (H. Jangli Sur). | *Sus indicus* | Found along the banks of the Sutlej, wherever there is sufficient cover; but common nowhere. Chief habitat, the long grass grown in the jungle to right of Railway Line to Phillour, where bunds, &c., have been erected. |\n| The Nilgai (H. Roz).          | *Portax pictus* | A few are found to south and southwest of district in jungles bordering on Native States, where, the Chiefs being Sikhs, they are more or less preserved, and are more common. |\n| The Antelope (H. Mirg, Harn). | *Antilope bergartica* | Found plentifully throughout the district. They rarely visit the low lands (B\u00e1t), but chiefly confine themselves to the higher land, where there are large plains surrounded by cultivation. Formerly large herds were found in the district; but now it is rare to see a herd of 100 individuals. In the south-west of the district their place is taken by the gazelle, and they are rarely or never seen. This is the more strange, as they are very common in Hisar and Sirsa districts closely resembling the south-west of this district in quality of soil, &c. |\n| The Gazelle (H. Harni, Chin-k\u00e1ra). | *Gazella Bennetii* | The ravine deer of sportsmen, common throughout the district, chiefly wherever sand hillocks dot the plains; very common to south-west of this district where it entirely supplants the antelope. |\n\n### List of the Game Birds found in the Ludhi\u00e1na District.\n\n| No. in Jerdon. | Name | Scientific Name | Habitat, &c. |\n|---------------|------|----------------|--------------|\n| 790           | The large Sand Grouse (H.

It remains till March and re-migrates north. Occasionally found mixed up with *P. aerarius*, but rare. Probably more numerous to the west and south-west of the district. |\n| 801           | The large Pictail Sand Grouse (H.

Mohr). | *Pavo cristatus* | Found in very many parts of the district. It is semi-domesticated, and is generally to be found near villages. It is held sacred by some of the villagers. |\n### List of the Game Birds found in the Ludhiana District\u2014Contd.\n\n| No. in Jerdon | Name | Scientific Name | Habitat, &c. |\n|---------------|------|-----------------|--------------|\n| 818           | The Black Partridge (H. K\u0101la T\u012btar). | *Francolinus vulgaris* | Nowhere very common; but a few are to be found along every mile of the Sirhind Canal. Also found in all the jungles to the south of the district. Not common to the south-west, where the grey partridge has supplanted it. |\n| 822           | The Grey Partridge (H. T\u012btar). | *Ortygornis ponticeri*. | Found sparingly everywhere wherever there is any jungle; near a village they seem specially to congregate; but wherever there is grass or bush they are to be found. To the south-west of the district they are most plentiful. |\n| 829           | The Quail (H. Batair). | *Coturnix communis* | Plentiful from April till the rabi crop is cut. Again they come in in September and stay till the kharif crop is cut; some few birds stay in long grass, &c., all the cold weather, and a very few stay and breed here in June and July. |\n| 830           | The Rain Quail (H. Batair). | *Coturnix coromandelica* | A rainy season visitor. It comes in in July, when its peculiar \"wheat-wheel\" is to be heard in cloudy weather all day. It leaves before C. communis arrives as a rule, though occasionally both birds may be flushed in one field. |\n| 834           | The large Button Quail (H. Batair). | *Turnix dussumieri* | This bird occasionally is flushed when quail-shooting in September and October, but is by no means plentiful and stays a very short time. |\n| 835           | The Button Quail (H. Chota Batair). | *Turnix sykesii* | Found occasionally in the spring and autumn crops. It has a very strong scent, and dogs invariably put them up, though they may fail to put up a common quail. |\n| 836           | The great Bustard (H. T\u014dghd\u0101r). | *Eupodotis eduardesi* | During certain times of the year visits the south-west of the district, probably during the hot weather and rains. |\n| 837           | The Oubara (H. Khur Mohr. P. Tilaco). | *Houbara Macqueenii* | A very few of this species visit this district during the cold weather. Occasionally a flock takes up its residence near an open bush jungle, and stays for a month or so; but this is rare. |\n| 839           | The lesser Florican (H........?) | *Sypherotides auritus* | Once, and only once, this bird was seen in this district. It was in September and was emigrating probably. It was in the \"People's Park\" at Ludhiana close to the civil station. |\n| 851           | The Lapwing (H. Titiri). | *Vanellus cristatus* | Found all along the Sutlej, but chiefly along the banks of the \"Budha N\u0101l\u0101,\" where it is plentiful during the cold weather. |\n| 853           | The white tailed Lapwing (H......?) | *Chettusia leucura* | Common along the \"Budha N\u0101l\u0101\" every cold weather, notwithstanding Jerdon's remark that it is a rare bird in India. |\n| 863           | The Sarus Crane (H.

It comes in in October and leaves in the end of March; spends the day near or on the river Sutlej, and flies inland to feed on the green crops or sown grain morning and evening. |\n| 866           | The Demoiselle Crane (H. Khar-khair.) | *Anthropoides virgo* | On its passage to and from lower India, this handsome bird occasionally stops to rest and feed on the Sutlej. It is only in October and the latter half of March that it is ever seen, and then only for a day at a time. It never makes a prolonged stay here, being more of a hill-loving bird than its congener *G. communis*. |\n| 871           | The Snipe (H. Ch\u00e1ha.) | *Gallinago scolopacina* | The full snipe of sportsmen. Common all along the \"Budha N\u00e1la\" and rushy places throughout the district. The first flight arrive about middle of September; no more come till October, when they straggle in; nowhere to be found in considerable numbers till January. They stay till end of March, and the last flights pass through in the end of April. |\n| 872           | The Jack Snipe (H.

K\u00e1la S\u00e1mp.) | Naja tripudians | The most deadly, as well as the most common, of all the poisonous snakes in the more cultivated parts of the district, and wherever there is cultivation, gardens, &c.; also in all the jungles. It grows to a large size, having been killed 6 feet long. In the open sandy parts of the district it is supplanted by E. carinata. |\n| The Ringed Snake (H. Karait). | Bungarus caruleus | Inhabits the same country as the cobra, except that it is not found in jungles. Commonest about gardens where there are old walls, &c. Hardly less deadly than the cobra, and as it has a habit of curling up by doors and under chinks, &c., and not moving at the approach of man, it is a most dangerous snake. Rare in this district, but found occasionally, chiefly towards Machh\u00edw\u00e1r and Bah\u00e1ulpur to the north-east of this district. |\n| The Russell's Viper (H......?) | Daboia Russellii | Very common throughout the district in the drier and more sandy parts. A small sluggish snake, and fortunately less deadly than any of the three foregoing species; otherwise there would be more deaths from snake-bite than there are. On being met at night it never attempts to get out of the way, but curls up in an attitude of defence and gives out a hissing noise by rubbing its carinated scales together. When a report of the poisonous snakes of this district was being prepared in 1871 (P) a very great number of these snakes were brought in. Their captors said they found them under any old logs about the fields or villages on the higher lands. This is the celebrated \"Kupper\" of Sindh probably, where it appears to be more deadly than in the Punjab. |\n| The Chain Adder | Echis carinata | |\n\n### List of the commoner Fishes found in the Ludhi\u00e1na District.\n\nThe Mah\u00e1sir ... Found throughout the year in the Sutlej and the Budha N\u00e1la. In the Sutlej they run to a large size, some specimens weighing about 50lbs. and over. They spawn in the rainy season.\n\nThe Roh\u00fa ... Found in the Sutlej and the Budha N\u00e1la; is even commoner than the Mahasir. It spawns in July and August. It runs to about 20 or 30lbs.; larger specimens are rarely found.\nThe Sewal ... When in condition one of the best fish for the table found here. There are several varieties of this fish. Its appearance changes greatly with the season and the water it is found in. It spawns late in the year, and the young may be seen in countless numbers in pools at that time.\n\nThe Bachwa ... During the rains, after the first heavy floods have swept down the Budha Nala, this fish begins to run up. It is rarely in good condition owing to the thickness of the water, but is notwithstanding the very best eating fish to be had here. In the Sutlej it is found in great quantities near any places where young fish congregate. It probably migrates for part of the year and also to spawn.\n\nThe Tingra ... Small specimens of this fish are found in any numbers in the Budha Nala and Sutlej. It rarely runs large, yet specimens of 5lbs. or so are sometimes caught by the fishermen.\n\nThe Eel ... \"B\u00e1m.\" Common in the Nala and Sutlej. In the latter it is occasionally found very large, 8 or 9lbs. in weight, but in the Budha Nala specimens of 1lb. even are rare. It is found all the year round and does not appear to migrate.\n\nThe Moh\u00fa ... This fish is found after the rains. It runs up after the heavy floods in the rains, and grows to a large size. Very commonly found 5lbs. in weight. It has a curious habit of rising constantly to the surface of the water and turning over, showing its very broad silvery side.\n\nThe Chapta ... Very like the Mohu, and closely allied to it in habit. It is commoner, and is found all the year round. It has the habit of turning over on the surface. It is a small fish, rarely weighing \u00bdlb. in weight.\n\nThe Mall\u00ed ... A common and very voracious fish, the shark of this part of the world. It runs to a large size in the Sutlej, and fair sized fish come up the Budha Nala in the rains. It breeds in July and August like the Rohu.\n\nThe Singh\u00ed ... A not very common and very repulsive-looking fish, very dark purple or red. Said to be a good table fish; but its looks keep people from trying it.\n\nThe Chilwa ... Common in both the Sutlej and the Budha Nala, where in autumn and spring it may be seen rising at gnats in hundreds like trout. By all accounts, owing to excessive netting with small meshed nets, this fish has been considerably thinned out near towns.\n\nThe Rewa ... Something like a small Mah\u00e1s\u00edr, but with scales like a grayling in parallel rows along the body. Has a curious habit of swimming in companies about on the surface with its mouth out of the water during the late autumn and spring.\nIn the cold weather wild fowl are plentiful along the river and in the Budha Nala, but they are much disturbed in the neighbourhood of Ludhi\u00e1na by native shik\u00e1ris. Very fair snipe-shooting may be had under Machiw\u00e1r\u00e1. Flocks of k\u00falan and geese are also to be met with in the fields. In the uplands there are a good many hares, though the Jat of the present day is fond of coursing: partridges, black and grey, are to be found in the sugarcane fields or where there is a small patch of jungle. Quails are abundant in their seasons; and sand grouse of several sorts are to be found in numbers in the cold weather amongst the moth, &c., stubble in sandy soils, as well as flocks of wild pigeon. Peacocks are common in the eastern part of the district, and live in the sugarcane fields. The ordinary Jats have no great objection to their being shot; but the birds are really half tame, and only eatable when young. Owing to the absence of cover it is not generally an easy matter to make a large bag, except, perhaps, amongst the quail or snipe; and one brings home from a day's shooting a most miscellaneous collection of game picked up in the fields. In some of the detached villages, which have a growth of jungle left, it is possible to get a good bag of grey partridge and hare: and there are some birds or reserves in Pati\u00e1la territory which are strictly preserved and abound with game. Pigs are very common along the river just under Ludhi\u00e1na. They find shelter mostly in the forest plantation on the Phillour road and in a large piece of land beside the river, covered with high grass, which has been taken up by the Railway Company for purposes of protection of their bridge. The number of pigs appears to have increased within recent years; and it is only here that they are found. They come out at night in swarms and ravage the fields to great distances about, devoting most of their attention to sugarcane, maize, &c., of which they are fond; but also rooting up the young spring crops from sheer vice. They are fondest of the ponda or thick sugarcane; and in Rajow\u00e1l and other villages, where it is grown extensively, the people are out all night along the boundaries of their fields with fires lighted and keeping up a continual noise. The pigs, however, do not appear to mind this, and get into the field. The amount of injury done by these pests is very large; but no systematic attempt has been made to kill them down. It is not possible to ride after them owing to the rough and broken nature of the country and the difficulty of getting them out. An occasional sportsman shoots a few, but the loss is not felt. The antelope and ravine deer are common in most places; and one has to go a very few miles from Ludhi\u00e1na to get a good black-buck. The deer are very tame; but shooting them is attended with considerable risk, owing to the perfectly flat nature of the country, and the number of people that are always working in the fields. Nilgai are found in some of the waste lands belonging to our detached villages.\nCHAPTER II.\n\nHISTORY.\n\nThere are no signs to indicate that the Ludhi\u00e1na district has been the scene of any great physical change. The Sutlej appears always to have been confined to its present valley, though within this it has shifted about a good deal. The last change took place about 100 years ago, when the river abandoned its course under the ridge that separates the lowlands from the Dh\u00e1ia where now the Budha N\u00e1la flows, and transferred to this side the whole of the present B\u00f4t tract, which was then for the most part uninhabited. The towns of Bahloipur, M\u00e1chiw\u00e1r\u00e1 and Ludhi\u00e1na, and the old villages, such as Kum and Bhundri, which lie on the top of the ridge, were built on the bank of the river. There is nothing to show that the uplands were ever traversed by streams unless, indeed, the sand belts of the Samr\u00e1la tahsil mark the course of hill torrents long since dried up. There are no local traditions indicating that such is the case, but this source of information would not go back more than 300 or 400 years. It is clear that such changes as have taken place in the appearance of the country are the work of man and not of nature.\n\nFew districts possess greater historical interest than Ludhi\u00e1na, which must from its situation have been at all periods the scene of most important events. Lying as it does on the high road from Central Asia, it would be crossed by each successive wave of conquest or immigration; and, when we come to historical times, we find that some of the most decisive conflicts for empire took place in this neighbourhood. The Punjab was always an outlying province of Hindust\u00e1n, and its loss was not fatal; but, once across the Sutlej, an invader had nothing between him and Delhi. Perhaps the greatest interest attaches to the country as the scene of the struggles between rising Sikhism and the Muhammadans; and when at the beginning of the present century the English power extended northwards till finally we succeeded to the empire of India, the Sutlej was fixed as the limit of our territories; and Ludhi\u00e1na was for nearly half a century our frontier garrison at the point where we were in contact with the only remaining independent power, that of the Punjab.\n\nLittle can be said of the Hindu period, for there is an absolute dearth of materials on which to found anything resembling history. Mr. Tolbort writes: \"I presume that it formed a portion of the kingdom of Magadha; Sunet, Tih\u00e1ra M\u00e1chiw\u00e1r\u00e1 and Bahloipur date from the Hindu period. It is said that Machiw\u00e1r\u00e1 is mentioned in the Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1r\u00e1t, and that Bahloipur formerly bore the name of Muhabatpura.\" But, as he points out elsewhere, there are many M\u00e1chiw\u00e1r\u00e1s. It is possible that antiquarian research may give us some information, but at present it has been applied only to the mound at Sunet, a village three or four miles west of Ludhi\u00e1na.\nThis mound is of very considerable extent, and clearly marks the site of an important city. It was visited by General Cunningham in 1878\u201379, and the result of his enquiries will be found at pages 65\u201367, Vol. XIV of the Archaeological Survey. General Cunningham examined bricks, one or two sculptures and a number of coins; and his conclusions from an examination of the last are as follows: \"From these coins the following facts may be deduced with almost absolute certainty:\n\n\"(1). The town of Sunet was in existence before the Christian era as evidenced by the coins of Uttamadatta and Amoghabhuti. It continued to flourish during the whole period of the dominion of the Indo-Scythians, and of their successors who used Sassanian types down to the time of Samanta Dewa, the Brahmin King of Kabul and the Punjab.\n\n\"(2). From the total absence of coins of the Tomar\u00e1 R\u00e1jas of Delhi as well as of all the different Muhammadan dynasties, it would appear that Sunet must have been destroyed during one of the invasions of Mahm\u00fad of Ghazni, and afterwards remained unoccupied for many centuries.\"\n\nThere are various legends about the destruction of Sunet, all of which represent the last R\u00e1ja as living on human flesh and as owing his downfall to not having spared the only child of a Brahmin widow. Mr. Tolbert appears to think that the town was overthrown by an earthquake. However this may be, it is likely that Sunet was the head-quarters of some Hindu kingdom, small or great; but more we cannot tell.\n\nCurrent tradition identifies Tih\u00e1r\u00e1 in the north-west corner of Jagraon tahsil with the city of Var\u00e1t mentioned in the Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1r\u00e1t; and this is said to have been its name up to Muhammadan times. It was a place of some importance under the Mughals; but the old town has long since disappeared into the river which ran under it, and the present site is at some distance from the former one. Tih\u00e1r\u00e1 may have been the capital of a small Hindu kingdom. There was also a city call Mohabatpur close to Bahlolpur; but of this too all traces have disappeared. It is quite possible that in Hindu times the country was to some extent inhabited by a nomad people, and that there were a good many towns and villages along the banks of the river; but they and the races that dwelt in them have long since disappeared, perhaps in the time of the early Muhammadan invasions when the country was overrun by plundering Biluchis and other tribes. The ancestors of the present agricultural population certainly immigrated within the last 700 or 800 years. The R\u00e1jputs were the first settlers, and came from the south. They say that in the reign of Shah\u00e1b-ud-din Ghori (A.D. 1157) their ancestors found the country all waste and obtained from the Emperor the grant of a large tract of land along the Sutlej, in which they settled. Their villages are almost all found along the ridge over the old course of the river, or in the valley beneath. They were followed by the Jats who mostly came from the same direction as the R\u00e1jputs, and began to settle in the uplands 400 or 500 years ago, first in the eastern parts, and much later in the west, tahsil Jagraon, &c.\nThere is no information about the district during the earlier Muhammadan invasions; and it is not till the time of the Lodis that the name is mentioned. The local history of Bute Shah, which is generally very reliable, gives the following account of the first attempt to establish a settled government in these parts: \"In the reign of Sikandar, son of Bahlol Lodi, the people about Ludhiana were oppressed by the plundering Biluchis, and applied to the Emperor for assistance. Sikandar, in answer to their prayer, sent two of his Lodi chiefs, by name Yusaf Khan and Nihang Khan, with an army. These chiefs fixed on the present site of the Ludhiana city, which was then a village called Mir Hota, as their head-quarters and restored order to the country about. Yusaf crossed the Sutlej to check the Khokhars, who were then plundering the Jullundur Doab, and settled at Sult\u00e1npur. Nihang Khan remained at Mir Hota as the Emperor's Lieutenant; and called the place Ludhi\u00e1na. He was succeeded by his son and grandson. The latter, Jal\u00e1l Kh\u00e1n, built the fort of Ludhi\u00e1na out of the bricks found at Sunet. His two sons partitioned the country round about Ludhi\u00e1na, which was then lying waste, amongst the people of the town, and distributed them in villages. In the time of Jal\u00e1l Kh\u00e1n's grandsons, Alu Kh\u00e1n and Khizr Kh\u00e1n, the Lodi dynasty was overthrown by B\u00e1bar; and the Lodis of Ludhi\u00e1na sunk to the position of ordinary subjects of the Mughal empire. They are said to have lived close to the fort for many generations, but all traces of them have now disappeared, and even the tombs of Nihang and his immediate descendants have been lost sight of, although they are said to have been standing some years ago.\" Without vouching for the accuracy of this account it may be said that the founding of the city of Ludhi\u00e1na, and the first systematic attempt to people the country about it, date from the reign of the Lodi dynasty who held the throne of Delhi from 1450 to 1525. Under Bahlol Lodi's \"beneficent administration the prosperity of the country reached its summit, and the limits of the empire were extended to the Indus\"\u2014(Marshman); and the reign of his successor, Sikandar, was a most prosperous one.\n\nThe progress of the country does not appear to have been impeded by the change of rulers; and the Mughals established a strong government at Sirhind, to which Ludhi\u00e1na and the country about it were attached as a mah\u00e1l or parganah. Sirhind, with the rest of the empire, passed into the hands of the Sur dynasty; and it was at the town of M\u00e1chiw\u00e1r\u00e1, 25 miles east of Ludhi\u00e1na, that Hum\u00e1yun fought the battle with Sikandar Sur, which restored him to the throne of Delhi in 1555. It is to the reign of Akbar (1556-1605) that most of the people in the eastern part of the district ascribe the advent of their ancestors and the founding of their villages, and it is most probable that before the commencement of the 16th century there were only a few villages scattered over the district (mostly R\u00e1jput), and that the great immigration of Jats, who occupy the whole of the uplands, began under the settled rule of the Lod\u00eds and continued during the whole of the 16th century. The Ain Akbari enumerates the following mah\u00e1ls (or parganahs as we should call them): Tih\u00e1r\u00e1h, Hatur, Bhundri, Ludhi\u00e1na, M\u00e1chiw\u00e1r\u00e1 and also Pael and Dur\u00e1h\u00e1. The first three\nare still considerable villages in Jagraon tahsil. The town of Pael and the village of Durah\u00e1 are situated in Patiala territory between Ludhiana and Samrala; and it is clear that these seven mahals, which were in the Sirhind division or Sarkar of the Delhi Province or Subah covered most of the present Ludhiana district and the adjoining parts of Patiala territory.\n\nDuring the century-and-a-half which followed the death of Akbar, historical interest centres for this part of the country in the rise of Sikhism as a power, and the constant struggles between the followers of the Gurus at first, and latterly the Phulkian and other Sikh chiefs on the one hand, and the local representatives of the empire on the other. The life of Nanak was contemporary with the reign of the Lodi dynasty; and Hargovind, the sixth Guru, was engaged during the latter years of Jahangir's reign in petty warfare with the imperial troops. Aurangzeb ascended the throne in 1657; and the ninth Guru, Tegh Bahadar, was murdered by his orders at Delhi in 1675. Govind Singh, the last of the Gurus, succeeded Tegh Bahadar; and under him commenced the long struggle between the Sis-Sutlej Sikhs and the Muhammadan Governors of Sirhind, which was only a part of Aurangzeb's persecution of the rising sect. This district, with the adjoining country to the south, was the scene of many of the great Guru's wanderings and encounters with his enemies; and it was in Sirhind that his wife and children were murdered about the year 1700\u2014a deed that has made the place for ever accursed to all true Sikhs. It is probably to the bigotry and persecution of Aurangzeb (whose memory the Sikhs to this day hold in great detestation, invariably referring to him as \"Ranga\") that we should ascribe the union of the followers of the Gurus into a militant power with one common object. Aurangzeb died in 1707 and Govind Singh in 1708. The latter was succeeded as leader of the Sikhs by Banda, under whom their arms were at first attended with success, the imperial troops being defeated and Sirhind sacked in 1709. But, although they twice overran the country between the Sutlej and the Jamna, they were finally dispersed, and Banda taken and executed in 1716. For a generation after this event the Sikhs were much depressed and persecuted; and it was only when all energy had departed from the empire that they were able to raise their heads again. From this time the struggle was continued by the Phulkian and other chiefs, who saw their way to establishing kingdoms for themselves on the ruins of the empire, now tottering to its fall. Ala Singh, the founder of the Patiala house, succeeded his father Ram\u00e1 in 1714; and was a contemporary of Rai Kalha (II) of Raikot, under whom the Rais of Raikot, who had hitherto held the lease of a considerable tract of land from the emperors (see history of the family in Chapter III, page 112), first asserted their independence. The district as now constituted cannot be said to have a separate history of its own during these times; and it would be impossible to detail here in full the conflicts between the various claimants for the territory which now makes it up. The principal actors in this scene were the Rai, Raja Ala Singh of Patiala, and the representative of the Delhi Empire at Sirhind. In 1741 we\nfind a combination of the two last against Rai Kalha, who had been endeavouring to throw off the Imperial authority. Rai Kalha was defeated and chased out of the country, but he soon recovered the territory which he had hitherto held as a fief of Delhi. The alliance between the Sikhs and the imperial troops lasted for a very short time; and the Rai was able to extend his territories unopposed, there being plenty of room for him to do so at the expense of the empire without danger of interfering with schemes of the Sikh chiefs. In a foot-note to page 60 of the Punjab \"Rajas\" is given a short sketch of the history of the Rais, and it is said that they got possession of the town of Ludhi\u00e1na in 1620; but this is evidently a mistake. The town and fort of Ludhi\u00e1na did not fall into the hands of the Rais till about the year 1760 A.D.\n\nThe invading army of N\u00e1dir Sh\u00e1h Dur\u00e1ni crossed the Sutlej at Ludhi\u00e1na, which was then on its banks, and marched through the district along the Imperial highway connecting Lahore and Delhi, the course of which corresponds with that of the present Grand Trunk Road and Railway. N\u00e1dir Sh\u00e1h is said to have ordered a general massacre of the inhabitants of Ludhi\u00e1na on account of some petty fault; but it appears doubtful if he did. Ahmad Sh\u00e1h entered India on his first expedition in 1747. On reaching the Sutlej at Ludhi\u00e1na, he found his passage opposed by the son of the emperor and the Vazir, Kamardin, with a large army which had advanced from Sirhind. Ahmad Sh\u00e1h, adopting the usual Dur\u00e1ni tactics, made a long night march up the right bank of the river; and crossing about M\u00e1chiw\u00e1r\u00e1 or Bahlolpur, endeavoured to throw himself between the Vazir and Sirhind. The two armies came face to face on a sandy plain between the villages of M\u00e1nupur, Barw\u00e1l\u00ed, &c., a few miles to the north-east of Khanna, in the Samr\u00e1la tahsil. The Imperial troops took up a strong position from which the Dur\u00e1ni could not dislodge them. Desultory fighting went on for many days, and in one of the skirmishes Kamardin was killed. His son, the distinguished Mir Mannu, was equal to the occasion; and, seating the body of his father on an elephant, paraded it before the troops. Ahmad Sh\u00e1h had finally to retire discomfited. It is said by the villagers about that the loss on both sides was very heavy; and that for a long time the stench of the dead bodies made the cultivation of the fields impossible. To the subsequent invasions of Ahmad Sh\u00e1h no resistance was attempted by the Imperial troops in Sirhind; but his armies were constantly harassed by the Phulk\u00edan chiefs and the Rais. It was some time about 1760 that the Rais were permitted by him to take possession of the town and fort of Ludhi\u00e1na and to extend their power over the country about. In 1761 Zain Kh\u00e1n was appointed by Ahmad Sh\u00e1h as Governor of Sirhind. In the following year there was a formidable combination against Zain Kh\u00e1n of all the Phulkian and other Sikh Cis-Sutlej chiefs, assisted by numerous bands of Sikhs from the M\u00e1njha or Punjab proper. Ahmad Sh\u00e1h heard of this at Lahore; and, marching to the Sutlej in two days, he crossed at Ludhi\u00e1na and fell upon the allies a short distance to the south of it just as they were attacking Zain Kh\u00e1n. The Sikh army was cut to pieces, and the fugitives pursued to a great distance. This disaster\n(called the \"Ghalu Gh\u00e1ra,\" or great massacre) does not appear to have had much effect on the Sikhs, for in the following year, 1763, they were able to bring together a large army composed of the Cis-Sutlej Sikhs, aided by bodies of their co-religionists from across the Sutlej. Zain Kh\u00e1n was defeated and slain, and the Sikhs, following their victory, took possession of Sirhind, which they levelled with the ground.\n\nWith the fall of Sirhind vanished the last vestige of Imperial control over that portion of the empire of which it was the headquarters; and when in the next year Ahmad Sh\u00e1h passed through the country he recognized this by appointing R\u00e1ja Ala Singh of Pati\u00e1la to be Governor. In 1767 Ahmad Sh\u00e1h reached Ludhi\u00e1na on his last expedition into India, but got no further. He confirmed Amar Singh, the grandson of Ala Singh, in the government of Sirhind, and gave him the title of Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja; and from this time the Sikhs and other chiefs who had taken possession of the country were left alone to settle their own affairs. The Imperial authority had to the last been maintained over most of the country lying between Ludhi\u00e1na and Umballa, and round the head-quarters of the Sark\u00e1r or division. On the fall of Sirhind the whole of this rich tract fell into the hands of the Phulk\u00ed\u00e1ns and their M\u00e1njha allies. The present Samr\u00e1l\u00e1 tahsil and a small portion of the east of Ludhi\u00e1na were partitioned between the latter, each chief and confederacy seizing as many villages as they could. The eastern boundary of the territory of the Rais had in the few years preceding the capture of Sirhind been quietly advanced eastwards from Badow\u00e1l, Dh\u00e1ndra, &c., so as to include the town of Ludhi\u00e1na and the whole of the villages in the uplands to the south and east of it to within a few miles of M\u00e1chiw\u00e1r\u00e1. Their northern boundary was the river Sutlej, which then flowed under the high bank along the present course of the Budha. The low lands opposite them were held to the south of Ludhi\u00e1na by the K\u00e1kar Sird\u00e1rs and Diw\u00e1n MohkamChand, and to the north by T\u00e1ra Singh Ghaiba (also a K\u00e1kar). There was no B\u00e9t on this side. The Malaudh Sird\u00e1rs had already established themselves in the south of Ludhi\u00e1na tahsil (the Jangal villages and the country about Malaudh); and Sudha Singh, Gil, an adventurer from Loh\u00e1ru in the Ferozepore district, secured a few villages about S\u00e1nahw\u00e1l. With these two exceptions the whole of the present uplands of the Jagraon and Ludhi\u00e1na tahsils belonged to the Rais; and they had also a considerable part of the Moga and Zira tahsils of Ferozepore, in all 1,360 villages, it is said. The Samr\u00e1l\u00e1 tahsil was divided as follows: Sudha Singh, Bajwa, seized M\u00e1chiw\u00e1r\u00e1 and the eastern portions of the Ut\u00e1lan parganah; and the western half fell into the hands of the Ladhran Sird\u00e1rs. In parganah Khanna some villages were held by a servant of T\u00e1ra Singh Ghaiba, who subsequently set up for himself at Khanna; and the rest was divided between the Kh\u00e9ri, Bhari, Ajmer, Jabu mazra Sird\u00e1rs and members of the Sontiw\u00e1la and Nish\u00e1nw\u00e1la confederacies. Jassa Singh, Ahluw\u00e1lia, (Kapurthala) got 30 or 40 villages round Isru. Under the Rais the Garew\u00e1ls of Raipur and Gujarw\u00e1l had some sort of local authority in the villages about; but they were only \"m\u00e1lguz\u00e1rs\" or contractors for the revenue.\nTwelve years after the fall of Sirhind, about the year 1785 A.D., occurred the change in the course of the Sutlej, to which reference has already been made; and the whole of what is now the B\u00e9t of the district came to this side, a tract upwards of 50 miles in length and five or six in width. It was at the time in the possession of the K\u00e1kars, T\u00e1ra Singh Ghaiba, whose head-quarters were at Rahon, having the upper part, and his brethren the lower portion, what is now the Nurpur parganah; and these chiefs retained their hold in it, except where Sudha Singh of S\u00e1nahw\u00e1l seized some uninhabited portions in front of his upland villages, about Matewarah. There was then very little cultivation in the tract, the villages being few and far between. Most of the present ones owe their foundation to these chiefs, and date it from within the last 100 years.\n\nThe Rais had a number of forts at different places, and each Sikh chief erected one or two according to the size of his possessions. This partition of the country appears to have been recognized by the various parties to it; and during the last forty years of the 18th century they do not seem to have attempted any encroachment on each other's territories, but to have gone on very amicably.\n\nThe condition of the country during the latter part of the 18th century was one of considerable prosperity. The rule of the Rais is still spoken of as being very mild; and it is said that they fixed only one-fourth of the produce as their due. The peasantry were probably very glad to have the struggle, which had been going on for so long, finally ended; and the petty chiefs appear to have done their best to encourage the spread of cultivation. They took a full revenue in kind, and exercised a good deal of petty tyranny; but one does not hear much of exactions in the early years of their rule; and they had scarcely time to engage in petty quarrels amongst themselves before the arrival of Ranjit Singh. The Dhaia villages mostly date their founding from a much earlier period; but the B\u00e9t tract at the time of its transfer to this side of the river was mostly waste; and the greater part of the present small villages owe their origin to the K\u00e1kar and Ghaiba Chiefs. One hears of few instances in which the proprietary body were at this time driven to desert their land by the oppression of the rulers. In fact the condition of the people was very much better at this time than it was subsequently under the followers of Ranjit Singh.\n\nThe peace which the country enjoyed after the fall of Sirhind was interrupted by the appearance on the scene of Bedi Sahib Singh of Una. This fanatic crossed the Sutlej in 1794 A.D., with an army of Sikhs from the Jullundur Do\u00e1b, proclaiming a religious war against the Path\u00e1ns of M\u00e1ler Kotla. He was turned aside from M\u00e1ler Kotla by the Pati\u00e1la chief; but in 1798 again crossed and made a similar attack on the Rais of Raikot. Rai Ali\u00e1s was a minor; but his agent Roshan, Guj\u00e1r, made a good stand against the Sikhs at Jodh, ten miles southwest of Ludhi\u00e1na. Roshan was killed in the fight, and the Rai's army dispersed; but the Phulkian chiefs, who had always been on good terms with their Muhammadan neighbours of Kotla and Raikot, and who had no intention of allowing the Bedi to establish himself in their midst, now came to the assistance of the Rai, and drove the invaders out of most of the villages.\nseized by them. The Bedi thereon invested the fort of Ludhi\u0101na; and the Rai called in the adventurer George Thomas from H\u0101nsi. On Thomas' approach the Bedi retired across the river, and ceased to trouble the country.\n\nThe capture of Delhi in 1803 brought the English into direct contact with the Cis-Sutlej chiefs from the south, and about the same time Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Ranjit Singh, having extended his dominions to the north bank of the Sutlej, began to think of conquest beyond it. The disputes between the states of Pati\u0101la, N\u0101bha and J\u012bnd afforded him the desired opportunity, and in July 1806 he crossed the Sutlej with an army. The last of the Rais (Ali\u00e1s) had been killed while hunting in 1802; and the family was represented by his widow, Bh\u0101g Bhari, and his mother, Nur ul Nisa. No opposition was offered to Ranjit Singh, who took possession of the town and fort of Ludhi\u0101na, and made them over with the villages about to his nephew, R\u0101ja Bh\u0101g Singh of J\u012bnd. He proceeded to Pati\u0101la on pretence of settling the disputes between the three chiefs, and returned to the Punjab via Umballa and Th\u0101nesar. In the following year (1807) he was again called in; and, crossing at the Hariki ford (Sobr\u0101on), he proceeded to Pati\u0101la, and thence marched into the Umballa district, where he besieged and took Naraingarh. During these two expeditions Ranjit Singh, besides stripping the Rais of all their territory save two or three villages given for maintenance, also annexed the possessions on this side of the river of Sudha Singh (S\u0101nahw\u0101l) which were held by his widow, R\u0101ni Lachmi, as well as of T\u0101ra Singh Ghaiba, also held by a widow, together with the K\u0101kar villages. The spoilation of the G'haiba family was perhaps the most shameless of all these transactions, as T\u0101ra Singh died in this very year while accompanying the Mah\u0101r\u0101ja on his expedition. These conquests were divided by the Mah\u0101r\u0101ja between himself and his adherents. R\u0101ja Bh\u0101g Singh of J\u012bnd got about 100 villages round Ludhi\u0101na and in the Bassian il\u0101qa; Sird\u0101r Fatteh Singh, Ahluw\u0101lia (ancestor of the present Kapurthala chief), nearly the whole of the Jagraon tahsil and the D\u0101kha parganah; Sird\u0101r Gurdit Singh of Ladwa, a number of villages about Badow\u0101l; Bh\u0101i L\u0101l Singh of Kaithal, 16 villages about Gujarw\u0101l; the N\u0101bha chief, some villages in Pakhow\u0101l; while the men of less note, such as the Sodhis of Nandpur, got j\u0101girs. Diw\u0101n Mohkam Chand was put in charge of the country reserved by Ranjit Singh for himself.\n\nBy this time the British Government had made up its mind that the further aggressions of Ranjit Singh on our side of the Sutlej should be stopped, and the chiefs taken under our protection. Mr. Metcalfe was despatched as agent to conclude treaty with Ranjit Singh, and joined his camp at Kas\u016br in September 1808. Immediately after this Ranjit Singh crossed the Sutlej on his third invasion and attacked Faridkot and M\u0101ler Kotla, notwithstanding the remonstrances of our envoy. After accomplishing his objects the Mah\u0101r\u0101ja returned to Amritsar, and there Mr. Metcalfe communicated to him the decision at which the Government had arrived\u2014that all conquests made in his first two expeditions might be retained, but that for the future the country between the Sutlej and Jamna was to be considered under our protection, and\nall territory seized during the last expedition restored. To support this demand a force under Colonel Ochterlony was moved towards the frontier, and on February 18th 1809 the troops reached Ludhi\u00e1na and took up a position there, which was destined to be permanent. It is matter of history how Ranjit Singh finally yielded to all our demands and entered into the treaty of 25th April 1809, by which he and his dependants were allowed to retain all territory on our side of the Sutlej acquired in the expeditions of 1806 and 1807. The occupation of Ludhi\u00e1na as a military outpost was intended to be temporary only; but the troops were never withdrawn. We had by the treaty taken under our protection all the Cis-Sutlej chiefs, except those who had been brought into the country by Ranjit Singh; and the management of our concerns with them required the presence of a Political Agent and a force at this point.\n\nGeneral Ochterlony held political charge at Ludhi\u00e1na from 1809 to 1815, and was succeeded by Captain Murray, after whom came Sir Claude Wade (1823-33). Sir D. Ochterlony and Sir C. Wade had the full powers of agents, but otherwise the post was held by an assistant. It was General Ochterlony who gave the fort its present form, Ranjit Singh setting up that of Phillour to face it after the conclusion of the treaty of 1809. In 1835 R\u00e1ja Sangat Singh of Jind died, and with him the direct line of the house failed. The escheat of the whole Jind territory, or at least of all bestowed on R\u00e1ja Bh\u00e1g Singh by Ranjit Singh, was claimed by the latter; but it was finally decided that Sar\u00fap Singh, a collateral of the late R\u00e1ja, should succeed to the ancient possessions of the family, those held by R\u00e1ja Gajpat Singh, and that all subsequent acquisitions should escheat to the British Government unless they had been granted by the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja after the treaty of 1809 (\"Punjab R\u00e1jas,\" p. 34, et seq.). By this decision we acquired upwards of 30 villages round Ludhi\u00e1na and in the neighbourhood of Bassian, with a revenue of about Rs. 1,00,000; and these formed the nucleus of the present district, the administration being carried on for the next ten years by the Assistant Political Agents at Ludhi\u00e1na, a list of whom will be found at p. 306 of the Punjab R\u00e1jas, and also in para. 35 of the Settlement Report by Mr. Davidson.\n\nRanjit Singh died in 1839, and his death was followed by six years of disorder in the Punjab. It would be out of place here to give a detailed account of the circumstances which led to the outbreak of the first Sikh war; but a short notice of our position in the Cis-Sutlej is necessary, as the neighbourhood of Ludhi\u00e1na was the scene of part of the struggle between us and the Kh\u00e1lsha army, and our hold on the station was of the first importance throughout. Up to 1838 Ludhi\u00e1na was our only outpost on the Lahore frontier; but in that year a large force was assembled at Ferozepore for the invasion of Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n, and the latter place somewhat threw Ludhi\u00e1na into the shade, being within easier reach of the capital of the Punjab. Ferozepore and the territory round it had lapsed to us on the death of R\u00e1ni Lachman Kour in 1835, in much the same manner as the Ludhi\u00e1na territory had. It was about the year 1838 that Sir George Clerk, the Governor-General's Agent at Umballa, built the large circuit house still standing at Bassian, a point from\nwhich communications could readily be maintained with both places and control exercised over the Phulki\u00e1n chiefs. On the withdrawal of the army from Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n in 1842 our position in the Cis-Sutlej territory west of Umballa was this. We had two patches of territory on the Sutlej in the neighbourhood of the garrisons of Ludhi\u00e1na and Ferozepore, which were completely isolated, and surrounded by the possessions of the Lahore Darb\u00e1r and its feudatories. Map No. IV accompanying the Revised Settlement Report shows the division of the country at the time between the various States and petty chiefs.\n\nIn December 1845 the Kh\u00e1lsa army crossed the Sutlej, and the first Sikh war commenced. The chief interest centres round Ferozepore, which was the main point of the Sikh attack; and there the bulk of our force collected, the troops for the most part marching direct via Bassian, while Ludhi\u00e1na was left with a mere garrison. But the position was not one likely to be neglected, as it covered the communications in the rear of our army; and its importance was probably appreciated by the Sikhs, for in January 1846 their general, Ranjodh Singh Majithia, created a diversion by appearing with an army at Phillour and crossing the Sutlej. His force consisted of 10,000 infantry, with 60 guns and some cavalry. His presence on this side of the Sutlej was fraught with the greatest danger to us, as in a struggle with the Lahore Sikhs we could at most expect little better than neutrality from their co-religionists on this side. The position of such chiefs as had territories on both sides of the Sutlej scarcely left them a choice. Nih\u00e1l Singh, Ahluw\u00e1lia, tried to play a double game. His troops fought against us about Ferozepore, and a considerable body of them joined Ranjodh Singh near Ludhi\u00e1na while their Master was professing friendship to us, and saying that he had no power over them. The L\u00e1dwa chief, whose head-quarters were at Badow\u00e1l, and who had everything to lose by such conduct, openly went over to Ranjodh Singh while he was still on the Jullundur side of the river. Such was the weakness of the Ludhi\u00e1na garrison that he was able before crossing to burn a portion of the cantonments with impunity; neither was any attempt made to bar the passage of Ranjodh Singh's army, which had our communications at its mercy. Such a state of affairs was not likely to last long; and Sir Harry Smith was soon despatched from Ferozepore with a force of about 4,000 men to keep open the road between that place and Ludhi\u00e1na. On January 20th he reached Jagraon, while Ranjodh Singh occupied Badow\u00e1l between the British force and its destination. Sir Harry Smith's object was to effect a junction with the Ludhi\u00e1na garrison without coming into collision with the enemy, and he accordingly attempted to pass to the south of their position. But his flank was attacked by the Sikhs with great violence near Badow\u00e1l, and our troops, wearied with a long march, were for some time in considerable danger. They were extricated from the position and brought into Ludhi\u00e1na with a loss of 200 men and nearly the whole of the baggage. The result of this action of January 21st was most damaging to our prestige; but the effects had scarcely time to be felt before they were effaced by the complete success of our arms. On the 22nd January, Ranjodh Singh moved\nto the village of Bhundri on the Sutlej, where he was joined by some regular troops of the Lahore army, his strength being then raised to 15,000; and here he remained quietly for a week, having, as he hoped, a clear line of retreat, and commanding the road along the Sutlej between Ferozepore and Ludhiana. General Smith was also reinforced, and on the 27th January marched towards the position of the Sikhs. He found them posted in the low lands close to the Sutlej, with their right resting on the village of Bhundri, which is on the high bank, and their left on Aliwal, close to the river. East of Bhundri the high bank or ridge, which separates the valley of the Sutlej from the uplands, sweeps inwards in a semi-circle to the distance of five or six miles, crowned with villages at intervals, and leaving a wide open plain between it and the river. It was across this plain that the British army on the morning of January 28th moved to the attack, the capture of the villages of Aliwal, the key of the position being their first object. The Sikh guns were as usual well served; but Aliwal was in the hands of inferior troops and the resistance was spiritless. By the capture of Aliwal the Sikh left was turned; but round the village of Bhundri their right, composed of trained and enthusiastic Khalsa troops (Avitabile's Regiments) made a most determined stand, and the whole battle is still called by natives \"the fight of Bhundri.\" The most gallant part of the action was the charge by the 16th Lancers of the unbroken Sikh infantry, who received them in squares. Three times the Sikhs were ridden over, but they reformed at once on each occasion; and it was not till the whole strength of our army was brought to bear on them that they were at length compelled to turn their backs. The Sikh troops were either driven across the river, in which many of them were drowned, or dispersed themselves over the uplands. Our loss was considerable, amounting to 400 men killed and wounded; and a tall monument, erected in the centre of the plain to the memory of those who fell, marks the scene of the action.\n\nThe battle of Aliwal cleared the upper Sutlej of our enemies, rendered our communications sure, and enabled Sir Harry Smith to join the army of the lower Sutlej with his victorious force. On the 11th of February the crowning victory of Sabraon was won, and the first Sikh war ended. The abrogation of the treaty of 1809, and the annexation of all Lahore territory on this side of the river, were the natural results of our success; and it remained to settle accounts with the Cis Sutlej chiefs who had either been in active opposition to us, or had withheld their assistance when it was most needed. The Ladwa chief forfeited all his possessions, and the Ahluwalia chief all on this side, while the Nabha Raja lost one-quarter of his territory (for a detailed account of these transactions see \"Punjab Rajas\"). Those of the minor chiefs who had not openly joined the enemy were maintained in their possessions; but these were included in our territory as jagirs, independent power being given only to the Phulkian Rajas and the Maler Kotla Nawabs. Where the chief had gone against us, his villages were absolutely annexed. From these acquisitions was formed in 1847 the present Ludhiana district, after a trial of Badni as head-quarters for a short period. Trifling changes have since occurred; and the\nmap above referred to as attached to the Settlement Report shows whence the various parts of the district, as it is now constituted, were acquired. A full account of the treatment of the petty chiefs whose territories were not annexed will be found at pages 186-200 of the \"Punjab Rajas.\" The police powers and the right to levy transit duties were taken away from them at once; and, when the whole Punjab became ours in 1849 they lost all civil, criminal and fiscal jurisdiction, a cash demand being at the same time substituted for their right to an undefined share of the produce. Thereafter they were \"considered as no more than ordinary subjects of the British Government, in possession of certain exceptional privileges.\" A cash commutation was also fixed in place of the levies which they were bound to furnish for the service of the paramount power.\n\nTo the work of conquest succeeded that of settling the administration of our new possessions. In passing we may mention the calamity which occurred to the 50th British Regiment shortly after its return to cantonments. It had suffered severely in the battles about Ferozepore and by sickness during the campaign, and was enjoying a well-earned rest, when in a dust storm one of the principal barrack buildings fell, crushing to death 210 men, women and children. When in 1849 the Punjab was annexed, Ludhi\u00e1na ceased to be of any importance as a military station. The cantonments were finally abandoned in 1854, and since that time the only troops permanently posted have been a portion of some native regiment as a garrison for the fort. During the ten years succeeding the Sutlej campaign Ludhi\u00e1na is to be pronounced happy as having no annals. The work of administration progressed steadily, and the resources of the country developed rapidly under the security given by our rule. A summary assessment in 1846-47 of the new acquisitions was followed in 1849-53 by a Regular Settlement of the whole district. Cultivation increased, and trade began to flourish in consequence of the removal of the transit duties, the improvement of communications, and the security to life and property which resulted from our rule.\n\nAlthough Ludhi\u00e1na had ceased to be a cantonment at the time of the outbreak of the Mutiny, it lay on the route to Delhi of the Punjab mutineers, and also of the succours sent by Sir J. Lawrence; and there were busy and anxious times for the Deputy Commissioner, Mr. G. H. Ricketts, and his assistant, Mr. Thornton.\n\nThe following account of the events of 1857 is taken from the Punjab Mutiny Report. Mr. Ricketts, the Deputy Commissioner of this district, had a most difficult part to play, and ably did he acquit himself. The town of Ludhi\u00e1na commands the high road from Delhi to the Punjab. It stands on the bank of the Sutlej at the head of the bridge-of-boats connecting Hindust\u00e1n with the Panjab proper. It is filled with a dissolute, lawless, mixed population of K\u00e1b\u00fal pensioners, Kashmiri shawl-workers, Gujars, Baurias and other predatory races. There is a fort without Europeans to guard it, a city without regular troops to restrain it, a district traversed by roads in every direction, joining the seven commercial towns which form the emporia of its trade, and situated on a\nriver which for months in the year is a mere network of fordable creeks which could only be guarded by a cordon of regular troops. Mr. Ricketts had for his jail and treasury-guard a company of enemies in the shape of a detachment of the 3rd Native Infantry, and on the breaking out of the mutiny received another company of the same regiment. As there was no dependence to be placed upon these men, he summoned the feudal chiefs and the independent states to send him troops. The chiefs of N\u00e1bha and M\u00e1ler Kotla sent in their men, to whom the safety of the station was entrusted. Detachments of these troops were likewise charged with the protection of the eight high roads that intersect the district, of the ferries, the fords and the gh\u00e1ts. The undisciplined N\u00e1bha troops unfortunately failed Mr. Ricketts in his hour of need. They would not follow the Jullundur mutineers; but this is not to be ascribed to any lukewarmness of their master. He was a staunch ally to us throughout.\n\nOther natives who materially aided the Deputy Commissioner were Mith Singh, Basant Singh, the Sult\u00e1n chaudhr\u00eds; and of the K\u00e1bul pensioners the following, viz., Hassan Kh\u00e1n, Abdul Rahm\u00e1n, Saleh Mahomed, Shahpur, and Sh\u00e1hz\u00e1da Sikandar.\n\nOn May 15th Mr. Ricketts sent his treasure to Phillour fort. It was placed under the charge of Mr. Thornton, Assistant Commissioner, whose labour in connection with it was greatly increased by the necessity of having to go to and fro a distance of seven miles across the swollen river on sudden and constant calls for money. At the same time Mr. Ricketts concentrated his police from the district at the station, adding by this movement 80 men to the force at his disposal for overawing the city. As a specimen of the vast amount of miscellaneous work entailed upon district officers generally during the mutiny, an extract from Mr. Ricketts' report may be given showing what he was obliged to do in Ludhi\u00e1na:\n\n\"Supervision began to be exercised over the post office; every post without exception, till October, was opened and sorted by my assistants or myself, and great and endless were the irregularities: extra ammunition was distributed throughout the district police; supplies were accumulated at the different encamping-grounds and halting-places; the prisoners were looked to and re-ironed; materials were collected for the bridge-of-boats, and the repair of its approaches; a staff of artizans and labourers, and an increased guard of picked Sikhs, were posted there. Parties of J\u00e1gird\u00e1ri or contingent horse were posted at all the tahsils and th\u00e1nas, and along all the roads. Proclamations of reward for the apprehension of deserters were promulgated; arms for the irregulars were escorted to Ferozepore through the deserting sepoys; ladies and children were sent out of the station and across the Sutlej to Phillour, where they had the advantage of a place of refuge in the fort garrisoned by Europeans; carriage for the transport of all kinds of army stores was collected; the bullock train arrangements were taken in hand; and the commissariat for European detachments passing through the executive in both these departments devolved, under existing circumstances, on the district officer, until at a subsequent date the transport service was separately organized; also supervision was instituted over all dealers in sulphur...\"\nand lead and vendors of caps; a system of passports for all travelers was instituted. Hindustanis supposed to be tainted were weeded out of all departments. The fort, after it was kindly vacated by the mutineers, was emptied of all its munitions of war, which were sent to Delhi; it was provisioned in case its defence became essential, which was fortunately unnecessary, as its well supplies no drinkable water; and it was placed in some sort of repair. A regiment of Sikhs was raised, in which all furlough men belonging to the district and on leave from their regiments were incorporated. Horses were collected for service at Delhi; 200 men were raised for Hodson's Horse, 50 old Sikh gollandizes (or artillerymen) survivors from Sobraon, were enlisted for service before Delhi; 500 or 600 Sikhs and Mazbis were enrolled as pioneers; 250 (I think) dooly-bearers were engaged and sent to Delhi for the transport service; 200 men were raised for the North-Western Provinces Police battalion. The men on furlough from the Ferozepore and Ludhiana Sikh regiments were formed, to the number of 140 (or thereabouts), into one body, were armed and sent down to the Muzaffarnagar district, where they are still watching the Rohilkund rebels. Estimates were formed of the amount of cattle available for provisions for the vast increase of European troops; and, lastly, the manufacturing classes in the town were set to work at sandbags for Delhi, at tent-cloth (of which 300,000 yards were made for tents for European troops), and on saddles for horse artillery; artizans were furnished for the magazines at Ferozepore and Phillour, and masons and carpenters for the new European barracks in course of construction in the hill stations; and so on, in various ways which have escaped my notes and my memory. The internal resources of the district were brought into play to meet the demands of the times, whilst the spirit of the people was taken advantage of to commit them to the quarrel against the common enemy, and the various subordinate official departments were roused by rewards freely given, and by punishments, sharp and severe, to lend their co-operation.\"\n\nMr. Ricketts, Lieutenant Yorke, and Captains Cox (Her Majesty's \u00a33rd) and Campbell nightly patrolled the streets of the city at any time between 10 p.m. and 2 a.m. Captain Nicolls, Assistant Commissioner, was entrusted with the duty of forming a Sikh regiment which the Chief Commissioner ordered to be raised.\n\nBut the event which must call into prominent notice the bad qualities of Ludhiana and the excellence of its officers was the transit of the Jullundur mutineers on the 8th June. A short time previous to the arrival of the mutineers, Mr. Ricketts had received information that all the armourers and furbishers of the city were plying a most profitable trade. This could be for no good purpose. He resolved to disarm the city on the first opportunity. One presented itself when Major Coke's corps, the 1st Punjab Infantry, reached Ludhiana on its way to Delhi. At dawn on the 20th June, on the inhabitants issuing from their homes, they found themselves confronted at every street-crossing, at every market-place, by bands of these ferocious warriors, and sent back to their homes. Bodies of police under\nEuropean officers entered each house and took the arms concealed therein. Eleven cartloads of arms were thus discovered and seized. The inhabitants had shown the animus which had prompted them in accumulating these arms by joining the Jullundur mutineers on their passage through a few days previous, by burning the church and the mission, by pillaging the mission-houses, by aiding the mutineers to mount heavy ordnance on the fort which the mutinous 3rd had delivered up, by supplying them with food and water, and by pointing out the residences of Government officers for plunder and destruction. This pillage could not be prevented by the civil authorities. News of the Jullundur mutiny did not reach them till 11 hours after it took place, when the mutineers were already crossing the river, and had joined the 3rd Native Infantry at Phillour. Mr. Ricketts promptly went out to encounter the mutineers, searched for them all day, and came upon them after nightfall. His auxiliaries fled; his sole supporters were a detachment of Captain Rothney's corps, the 4th Sikhs, under Lieutenant Williams, who was severely wounded; he had to work a gun with his own hands until his ammunition ran out, and then was obliged reluctantly to retreat. At Jullundur and Ludhiana, as in very many other places, the rebels had outwitted themselves. In their eager hurry to escape from Jullundur, they took blank cartridges and left the balled cartridges behind. They arrived at Ludhiana, and in the height of their triumph at occupying the fort found, to their dismay, that it contained vast stores of guns and powder, but no shot. They had none with them, not even musket balls. To remain was useless. They evacuated Ludhiana and reached Delhi in safety, owing to the weakness of the pursuit which was made by the military from Jullundur. However Ludhiana was saved. The grand trunk road remained in our power. None suffered eventually from the riot except the rioters themselves and the city which harboured them. Twenty-two of the plunderers were hanged the next day, and the city was fined Rs. 55,294.\n\nOf this measure Mr. Montgomery writes: \"The proposal to levy this fine emanated from Mr. Ricketts himself. It met my cordial approval, and has been sanctioned by the Chief Commissioner. I consider it one of the most masterly strokes of policy of the whole Punjab. The principle is well understood by the people, that when any members of a community disgrace themselves by violent encroachments on the rights of others, the whole community to which they belong atones for their guilt by pecuniary compensation to the sufferers, and by a fine to Government for its outraged authority. In this case it produced the most strikingly beneficial effects. It quieted not only Ludhiana, but all the six market towns of the district. It inspired a salutary dread of Government, which was so manifestly inclined to hold its own and care for neither prince, peasant nor mutineer. Compensation was made to all the sufferers to the full extent of their losses, leaving a small balance which will nearly cover the loss to Government property.\"\n\nAfter the display of such an animus by the rabble of Ludhiana and its neighbourhood, it was necessary to put it out of their power ever to display it again. To this end, all native houses within 300\nyards of the fort were levelled, and the G\u00fajar population turned out to the low lands beyond the city. The G\u00fajars of the whole district were disarmed, but not the Jats, as their subsequent co-operation with the British Government was reasonably to be expected from the good feeling they had already shown. The G\u00fajars were also deprived of their boats, and inflated skins (for crossing the river) were made contraband amongst them. The low Hindust\u00e1n\u00ed population swarming in the old cantonment was dispersed and sent home.\n\nParticular instances of sedition occurred besides the great ebullition on June 8th. A fanatical G\u00fajar maulvi, after preaching sedition for some time, went off to Delhi. One or two of the K\u00e1b\u00fal pensioners (descendants of Sh\u00e1h Sh\u00fajah) followed his example. The 3rd Native Infantry, before they left, were also known to be firebrands, but nothing could be proved against them. The Hindu chaudhr\u00eds were, as a body, timid and lukewarm in our cause. On the other hand, instances of good feeling were also manifested. R\u00e1m Singh, one of these Hindu chaudhr\u00eds (or headmen), was an honorable exception to his class. He was ever active in laying in supplies, and at a very critical time advanced nearly Rs. 3,000 for the public service. The Jats of the Raikot th\u00e1na, when informed of the mutinies at Ferozepore and Jullundur, set themselves to watch all the roads and wells with the aim of seizing stragglers. It were an endless task to enumerate all the instances of good and bad feeling among the people of this district. The outline here furnished will show the difficulties that the district officers had to battle with, and the energy with which they met them. The Muhammadan G\u00fajars of the B\u00e9t are the only people of the district who appear to have shown any disaffection, but it is in the nature of this tribe to be discontented. The Hindu Jats, who form the mass of the population, could have nothing in common with the mutineers, and were steadfastly loyal to us. Not a single instance of disturbance in any part of the district, save in the town of Ludhi\u00e1na, is recorded.\n\nThe only event left to chronicle is the \"mad attempt\" by the K\u00fakas in 1872. An account of the rise of this sect will be found in the next chapter. The proceedings of R\u00e1m Singh's followers had caused anxiety to Government for many years, and special precautions were from time to time taken to prevent large gatherings of them. Small disturbances occurred at the religious fairs here and there; and in 1870 \"butcher\" murders were committed in one or two places, the rage of the K\u00fakas being directed against the killers of kine. On the 13th January 1872 there was a meeting of K\u00fakas at Bhaini, and a gang of about 150 of these, after working themselves up into a state of religious frenzy, started off under the leadership of two Jats of Sakraundi in Pati\u00e1la territory. R\u00e1m Singh informed the police of their intention to do some mischief, saying that he had no control over them; but it was considered sufficient to see them out of our territory. They were armed with axes, sticks, &c., only, and are said to have declared that the town of M\u00e1ler Kotla would be the object of their attack. They went to Pael in Pati\u00e1la territory without causing any disturbance, and re-appeared next day near to Malaudh, the seat of Sard\u00e1r Badan Singh, on which they made a sudden onset with the idea, probably, of getting arms and\nmoney. They are said to have wanted the Sard\u00e1r to lead them. In this attack two men were killed on each side and a few wounded, and the gang succeeded in securing three horses, one gun and one sword. No one joined them anywhere on their march, and they never numbered more than 150 men at the outside. They next proceeded to Kotla, which is nine miles distant from Malaudh, and on the morning of the 15th made a sudden attack on the palace and treasury of the Naw\u00e1b; but were driven off when the Kotla guards had recovered from their surprise, and pursued to Rurr in the Pati\u00e1la territory, where to the number of 68 they surrendered to the Pati\u00e1la authorities. At Malaudh and Kotla they had killed 10 men and wounded 17, while their own loss had been 9 killed and 38 wounded. On getting news of the attacks on Malaudh and Kotla, Mr. Cowan, the Deputy Commissioner of Ludhi\u00e1na, started for the latter place, and telegraphed for troops, which arrived soon after. Mr. Cowan executed by blowing from guns at Kotla 49 of the captured men, and the others were tried by the Commissioner (Mr. Forsyth). Thus ended the K\u00faka outbreak of 1872. If the K\u00fakas ever had any plans for a rising they must have been completely upset by these insane proceedings of a small body of fanatics, rushing about the country armed with sticks and axes. The people of the villages through which they passed appear to have been scared by them, and the inhabitants of Rurr, where they were captured, deserted their houses in a body on the approach of the band. Of course R\u00e1m Singh and his doctrines were responsible for what happened; and he had become a danger to the State, as similar disturbances might be created at any time by his followers. R\u00e1m Singh was at once deported, and has remained a State prisoner ever since.\n\nThe district has few monuments of antiquity. Such places of interest as there are in the towns will be referred to in the separate accounts given of the municipalities in Chapter VI. The notice of the Hindu period at the commencement of this chapter contains such information as is available about the mound of Sunet. There are also mounds at several other places; but they generally mark the site of a parent village from which those about have taken their origin. Thus between Gujarw\u00e1l and Phallew\u00e1l the mound of Naibad marks the first settlement of the Garew\u00e1ls. As monuments of the Mughal empire, we have at a distance of two kos along the old B\u00e1dsh\u00e1hi Road min\u00e1rs marking the distances; and a fine serai at every sixth or seventh kos. The min\u00e1rs are of masonry, and about 12 feet high. They are in a good state of preservation, but have no inscriptions. They are said to have been built in the reign of Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n. The serai at Ludhi\u00e1na has long since disappeared, that at Doraha is in Pati\u00e1la territory, while that of Lashkari Kh\u00e1n, about seven miles on this side of Khanna, is a magnificent building in very good preservation. The inscription tells us that it was built by Lashkar Kh\u00e1n in the reign of Aurangzeb. It is now seldom used by travellers since the Railway was opened. The serai at Khanna is now part of the town; but the walls are entire. There was a large \"haz\u00edra,\" or tomb, at Tihar\u00e1 of about the same date, but this was washed away by the river in 1868. The Sikhs erected forts at many places in the district, most of which were demolished in 1845. The\nmonument in the field of Aliwal has already been referred to. This has been recently repaired or rebuilt. The cemetery of Ludhiana is crowded with monuments of quaint design, remnants of the days when there was a large body of troops here.\n\nThe manner in which the various portions of the district are liable to be affected by drought is fully discussed in Chapter IV, (page 144). The earliest famine of which men talk is that of Sambat 1787 (A.D. 1730). The memory of it is preserved in the saying \"satassiake maria hua,\" applied to a man who has got food and refuses to feed a starving beggar; but no particulars are forthcoming as to how the people lived, or what was the extent of its ravages. There was drought in A.D. 1759 and again in 1770, but apparently no famine; and the affects were only felt for a few months. The memory of these visitations has been effaced by that which followed. The terrible famine of Sambat 1840 (A.D. 1783), called \"chalia,\" appears to have spared no part of Northern India, and this district suffered with the rest of the country. It began with the failure of the autumn rains of Sambat 1839, there being little or no yield in the kharif and following rabi harvests. Prices rose from Bhadon (Sambat 1839), and by Baisakh (Sambat 1840) wheat was selling at 20 seers kachcha (8 seers pucka) a rupee. Rain fell in Har, but not afterwards; and the kharif crops of Sambat 1840 all withered. In Katak of that year wheat was at 8 seers kachcha (3\u00bd seers pucka) a rupee; and, if we consider the difference in the value of money then and now, we may realize the extent of calamity from this. The rabi was not sown except at the wells, of which there were not nearly so many as now. In Chet Sambat 1841 there was rain; and in Har the usual autumn falls began. The kharif and rabi following were very good. The pressure of famine lasted nearly 2\u00bd years altogether, and the mortality must have been tremendous. Grain could not be bought for money; and people are said to have died with bags of rupees under their heads. All natural affection was lost sight of, and parents robbed their children of their food, and looked on to see them die. Many emigrated beyond the Jamna, where there appears to have been something to live on. People are even said to have been driven to cannibalism. The cattle died everywhere; and, when the rain did come, men had to drag the plough through the fields. The green crop was eaten whenever the heads were formed, and many people lost their lives from sickness brought on by improper food. Famine was as usual followed by disease. When the people were able to resume the cultivation of their land, the country gradually recovered its prosperity; but the horrors of the \"chalia\" will long be remembered. It is worthy of remark that not a single village was totally deserted in this famine. Proprietors abandoned their land here and there, and many must have died; but the mass of them adhered to their villages, probably in most cases because there were wells at which the survivors could eke out some sort of existence. The history of no village contains any allusion to its having been deserted at this time; and the few that date their foundation from a later period than the \"chalia\" were settled by the ruler of the time.\nin the surplus area of some old village contrary to the wishes of the rightful owners.\n\nThe next famine was in Sambat 1869 (1812-13 A.D.). The kharif of Sambat 1868 and rabi following were poor, and fodder scarce. Rain fell at first, but stopped; and the kharif of Sambat 1869 and rabi succeeding failed, except at the wells. Grain rose to 18 seers kachcha (7 seers pucka); and straw was not to be had. There was a tremendous loss of cattle, and oxen ceased to have any value, being given away for nothing, or turned loose in the fields. The autumn rains of Sambat 1870 were good, and prices fell. The loss of human life was not perhaps very great, and was confined to the poorer classes, labourers and artizans, in the towns and villages.\n\nThe history of the \"nabia\" or scarcity of Sambat 1890 (1833 A.D.) is as follows. Grain was selling at two maunds (pucka) a rupee when it began. The autumn rains of Sambat 1890 failed; and the two harvests produced almost nothing except at the wells, where carrots and other vegetables were grown. The loss of human life and of cattle appears not to have been considerable; and the price of gram was never higher than 17 seers pucka; but this was of course very dear for those times, and would mean 8 or 10 seers a rupee now. In Sambat 1894 there was a scarcity, but not of much severity. The people had not, however, recovered from the \"ninety.\" Witness the couplet:\n\n\"Saved from the 90, succumbed to 94; there were clouds by day and starry nights.\"\n\nOf the next scarcity, that of A.D. 1860-61, we have official information. The account for this district is as follows. The rabi of Sambat 1917 (1860 A.D.) was poor, the winter rains having failed; and the price of wheat rose to 34 seers pucka by Baisakh. There was rain in Har, but not in the following months; and the kharif was sown, but withered. There was a great drain on the grain stores of this district, caused by the scarcity in those to the south; and the price of wheat rose till it reached at one time seven or eight seers a rupee. The rabi was very poor, but did not fail entirely; and the rains of 1918 were plentiful. There was a great scarcity of fodder and a considerable loss of cattle; but none of human life from actual starvation, in the villages at all events. It was a famine in the \"Bangar\" country (Rohtak, Hissar, &c.), and numbers flocked northwards from those parts. The people say \"Kal Bangar thon upje bura,\" i.e., \"a famine coming from the Bangar is bad.\" The stores of grain were sold at an immense profit, which probably more than compensated for the loss of cattle. The scarcity of Sambat 1917 will be found to be the turning point in the fortunes of many agriculturists of the western and Jangal villages. Most of them had grain in store; but the unlucky few that had not were compelled to incur a debt of which they have never got rid. Mortgages in Jagron tahsil can be as often as not traced back to the \"17\" (\"satarah\") or the following \"25\" (\"panji\"). There was some acute distress amongst the lower classes in the towns; but the whole famine expenditure appears to have amounted only to about Rs. 6,000; and, although a suspension of 3 per cent. of the revenue was considered necessary, the balance was\nsoon realized. Captain (afterwards Colonel) McNeile writes in 1861 that the money-lenders were complaining that the Jats had paid off all their debts and taken the grain trade completely out of the hands of the regular merchants.\n\nThe scarcity of A.D. 1869-70 was, as regards this district, of much the same character as that of 1860-61; but the harvests were better, and the injury done was confined to a not very considerable loss of cattle, and to debt incurred by individuals from this cause or from their having to purchase grain for food. Wheat went as high as eight or ten seers a rupee; but the people affected by this were as usual the artizans and labourers in the towns. There was on both occasions a good deal of immigration from the south of starving people. The whole expenditure on relief works amounted to Rs. 7,000, incurred entirely in the towns. On the other hand the mass of the agricultural population, at all events of the western parts of the district, where the effects of famine ought first to be felt, profited greatly by the high prices as in 1860; and the advantages to them as a whole far outweighed the evils. Nominal suspensions to the amount of Rs. 2,500 were sanctioned; but the balances recovered next year.\n\nIn the reports of 1877-78 Ludhi\u00e1na is shown as \"unaffected.\" The harvests were very fair; but prices were run up to famine rates in consequence of the demand from the North-Western Provinces, Madras and Bombay. This was to the entire benefit of the cultivator, and to such as had stores of grain.\n\nIn the Settlement Report the famine history of the district is thus summarised: \"Thus we have the history of the last century as follows: a terrible famine with immense loss of life in A.D. 1783; acute distress in 1812, and distress in 1833 and 1837 felt by most people. But for the development of communications which took place after annexation I do not think that prices would have been very high in 1860 and 1868; and it is probable that the gain to the agricultural population was greater than the loss in those years. There is, however, a very considerable portion of both town and village population who will always be affected by a rise of prices, the classes who subsist by labour paid for by a cash wage; and to these must be added the numbers of immigrants who are driven into this district by famine in the country to the south of it.\"\n\nSome conception of the development of the district since it came into our hands may be gathered from Table No. II, which gives some of the leading statistics for five yearly periods, so far as they are available; while most of the other tables appended to this work give comparative figures for the last few years. In the case of Table No. II, it is probable that the figures are not always strictly comparable, their basis not being the same in all cases from one period to another; but the figures may be accepted as showing in general terms the nature and extent of the advance made.\n\nThe district practically assumed its present dimensions in 1850. The first portion which came under British rule consisted of the estates belonging to Jind which lapsed in 1835, on the death of R\u00e1ja Sangat Singh without direct heirs. These estates included Ludhi\u00e1na itself and 84 villages, yielding a revenue of Rs. 98,229.\nOn the termination of the Sutlej campaign the whole of the Lahore and Kapurthala territories on this side of the river were confiscated, together with one-quarter of the possessions of the N\u00e1hba R\u00e1ja, and the whole of those of the L\u00e1dwa chief. In 1849, on the annexation of the Punjab, the territories of the petty sird\u00e1rs and confederacies, who had been under our protection since 1803, but had enjoyed a sort of independence, were incorporated in the Ludhi\u00e1na district as j\u00e1girs.\n\nFrom the time of the constitution of the district up to 1866 it was divided into four tahsils: Samr\u00e1la (also called at one time Sarai Lashkari Kh\u00e1n), Ludhi\u00e1na, Pakhow\u00e1l and Jagraon; but in 1866 the Pakhow\u00e1l tahsil was broken up, and a few villages added to Jagraon, while most of them were attached to Ludhi\u00e1na. There are now three tahsils, of which one has its head-quarters at Ludhi\u00e1na; and the others at Samr\u00e1la and Jagraon.\n\nThe Ludhi\u00e1na tahsil has a larger revenue than nearly half of the districts in the province, and from a glance at the map it would appear as if the grouping of the villages was very awkward, those of the Jangal lying much nearer to Jagraon than to Ludhi\u00e1na. But the whole of the Malaudh parganah, which includes the villages about Malaudh and also the detached ones referred to above, is, with the exception of two or three villages assigned to other j\u00e1g\u00edrdars, held in j\u00e1gir by the Malaudh family.\n\nThe tahsils are further subdivided into parganahs, distributed among the four old tahsils. The parganahs are as follows:\n\n| Tahsil | Parganah |\n|--------|----------|\n| Ludhi\u00e1na | Umedpur. Bhartgarh. D\u00e1kha. S\u00e1uahw\u00e1l. Ludhi\u00e1na. N\u00farpur. Ak\u00e1lgarh. Bassian. |\n| Pakhow\u00e1l | Pakhow\u00e1l. Gungr\u00e1na. Malaudh. |\n\nOn the abolition of the Pakhowal tahsil, the parganahs of Pakhow\u00e1l, Gungr\u00e1na and Malaudh were added to Ludhi\u00e1na, and those of Ak\u00e1lgarh and Bassian to Jagraon.\n\nAt annexation the country was found to be divided into il\u00e1qas, or collections of villages each held by a chief; and at the Regular Settlement these were doubled up in some places, and in others preserved as separate parganahs, with a very unequal result. Thus Khanna parganah contains 118 villages, and has a revenue of Rs. 1,79,969; while Umedpur has 12 villages, and Rs. 14,414 revenue. These parganahs have not been retained in the new Settlement.\n\nThe following table shows the officers who have held charge of the district since annexation, so far as the information is available.\n| Name                  | From               | To                  |\n|-----------------------|--------------------|---------------------|\n| Captain H.

Further information will be found in Chapter II of the Census Report of 1881:\n\n| Percentage of total population who live in villages | Persons | 86\u00b758 |\n|---------------------------------------------------|---------|-------|\n| Average rural population per village              |         | 623   |\n| Average total population per village and town     |         | 720   |\n| Number of villages per 100 square miles          |         | 62    |\n| Average distance from village to village, in miles|         | 1\u00b736  |\n\n| Density of population per square mile of          | Total area | Rural population | 450 |\n|---------------------------------------------------|------------|-----------------|-----|\n| Cultivated area                                   |            |                 | 390 |\n| Cultivable area                                   |            |                 | 553 |\n| Total population                                  |            |                 | 479 |\n| Rural population                                  |            |                 | 490 |\n| Cultivable area                                   |            |                 | 424 |\n| Villages                                          |            |                 | 1\u00b732|\n| Towns                                             |            |                 | 1\u00b759|\n| Villages                                          |            |                 | 5\u00b792|\n| Towns                                             |            |                 | 6\u00b706|\n| Villages                                          |            |                 | 4\u00b747|\n| Towns                                             |            |                 | 3\u00b780|\n\nMr. Walker, who has more accurate statistics of cultivation than were available at the time of the Census, has in the Settlement Report the following interesting discussion of the distribution of population:\n\n\"The number of persons per square mile is 450 on total area and 543 on cultivation (1\u00b71 acres of cultivation a head), these averages being worked out on the area as surveyed in 1879-80 and the Census of 1881. But the bare figures give us no information on the point which is of greatest importance, the pressure of population on the land; and we are driven to consider that constantly recurring problem of the classification, with a view to determine what proportion actually depends on agriculture. I have set down the urban population at 83,052; but in the case of each of the towns there is a large area attached and belonging to residents. Thus the area of Raikot is larger than that of any village in the district, except one; and it would have, if there were no town, a village population of 4,000 to 5,000. So, too, Ludhi\u0101na and Jagraon have a number of separate village areas attached to them, the agricultural population living inside the towns. I calculate that the town population proper does certainly not exceed 60,000. We are then left with a rural population of 558,835; but this does not put us far on our way. Combination of occupations is the rule amongst the non-proprietary population, and the recent Census could scarcely have been expected to...\"\ngive us a classification that could be relied on to show how much of this rural population should be set down as depending on agriculture, and how much on trade and manufacture. Indeed, such an arrangement is not possible with a society so constituted as that we have to deal with here. The whole rural population may be said in a sense to be supported by the land, each village being for most purposes a separate community. All the implements of agriculture, the materials and furniture of the houses, with most of the ordinary clothing, are produced in the village; and only a few articles of luxury, such as brass-dishes, wedding clothes, &c., are purchased in the towns. The occupations of the various classes in the village hang together, so that they cannot well be separated. Thus the menial classes (tarkh\u00e1n loh\u00e1r, cham\u00e1r) are really the servants of the cultivator, helping him in his work by making and repairing his implements, and receiving as their wages a share of the produce. They do little work for outsiders; and they very often combine with their hereditary occupation that of agriculture. Even the shop-keepers, who are not a numerous class in most villages, and occupy a very inferior position, being mostly of the \"l\u00fan t\u00e9l bechna\" class (sellers of salt and oil), are only assistants to the cultivators, supplying them with salt and such necessaries as they cannot grow or make for themselves. We might say that the whole population, after deducting that properly belonging to the towns and subsisting by manufactures and industries quite separate from agriculture, depends on the soil; and I think that any attempt to determine what proportion of it is supported solely by agriculture must be mere conjecture. The density of the rural population calculated in this manner is 490 per square mile of cultivation, or 1:3 acres cultivated per head. It varies greatly, as was to be expected, according to the agriculture of the district. Thus in the rich Samr\u00e1la B\u00e9t, where the soil is very fertile and much of it yields two crops in the year, the incidence is 600; and in the Upper Dh\u00e1\u00eda Circle of the same tahsil, where 40 per cent. of the cultivation is irrigated, it is 660; while in the sandy Lower Dh\u00e1\u00eda tract, just over the B\u00e9t, it is only 467; and in the Jangal Circle of Ludhi\u00e1na, with a rainfall of 17 inches and no irrigation, it is 318.\n\nThe following are the details of the three most thickly-populated tracts of the district:\n\n| Assessment Circle          | Persons per square mile cultivated |\n|----------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| B\u00e9t Samr\u00e1la                | 600                                |\n| Upper Dh\u00e1\u00eda Samr\u00e1la        | 660                                |\n| Paw\u00e1th Ludhi\u00e1na            | 630                                |\n\n\"These proportions are as high as in most of the highly cultivated tracts of the province, although they are much below those of some parts of Hoshi\u00e1rpur and Jullundur. There can be no doubt that in places there is to some extent a pressure of population, especially in the tracts named and in the eastern parts of Ludhi\u00e1na tahsil, B\u00e9t an\nuplands. This pressure is not universal, but shows itself in the older and larger villages where the process of subdivision of land has been going on longest. It is just in these very tracts where the cultivation is most elaborate, that the people are most tied down to their villages. Very few men of the Samr\u0101la tahsil will be found in service. From his birth the agriculturist is bound to the land, which requires his every hour; and the last thing he thinks of is seeking employment of any other sort. There is no emigration to speak of, and the direction in which the excess tries to find an outlet is better cultivation and the spread of irrigation. But for the latter of these capital is required, and this is what the cultivator does not possess.\n\n\"As for distribution by houses and families, the custom in the villages is for each family to have a separate house, and it is very seldom that a house contains more than one family. An agriculturist when he marries almost invariably sets up a separate house, and this is the practice amongst most non-agriculturists resident in villages. The town returns show two families to each house, at all events in the city of Ludhi\u0101na. This is probably due to various causes, e.g., a whole serai being counted as one house. The poorer classes in cities are also in the habit of living several families together in one house.\"\n\nTable No. VI shows the principal districts and states with which the district has exchanged population, the number of migrants in each direction, and the distribution of immigrants by tahsils. Further details will be found in Table XI and in Supplementary Tables C to H of the Census Report for 1881, while the whole subject is discussed at length in Part II of Chapter III of the same report. The total gain and loss to the district by migration is shown in the margin. The total number of residents born out of the district is 91,478, of whom 32,781 are males and 58,697 females. The number of people born in the district and living in other parts of the Punjab is 85,595, of whom 30,955 are males and 54,640 females. The figures below show the general distribution of the population by birth-place:\n\n| Proportion per mille of total population. |\n|------------------------------------------|\n| Gain | Loss |\n| Persons ... | 148 | 133 |\n| Males ... | 96 | 91 |\n| Females ... | 211 | 196 |\n\nThe following remarks on the migration to and from Ludhi\u0101na are taken from the Census Report:\n\n\"Ludhi\u0101na, with its extensive riverain, occupies an intermediate position between the thickly peopled submontane districts in the north and the irrigated plains to the south. From overcrowded Umballa, Jullundur and Hoshi\u0101rpur, it receives surplus population, while it attracts immigrants from the central states which lie to its...\"\nsouth. On the other hand, the rapid extension of canal irrigation in Lahore, Amritsar and Ferozepore has attracted a large emigration to those districts. Much of the emigration in the case of Ferozepore, Umballa and Jullundur, and almost all the emigration to Hoshiarpur, is of the reciprocal type, while in the case of the Native States no less than seven-tenths of the migrants are women. The Kashmir colony in the town of Ludhiana does not appear to have been recruited to any considerable extent during the lifetime of the present generation.\n\nThe figures in the statement below show the population of the district as it stood at the three enumerations of 1855, 1868, 1881:\n\n| Year | Persons | Males | Females | Density per square mile |\n|------|---------|-------|---------|------------------------|\n| 1855 | 527,772 | 292,809 | 234,963 | 363                    |\n| 1868 | 586,647 | 330,571 | 256,076 | 429                    |\n| 1881 | 618,835 | 339,569 | 279,267 | 450                    |\n\nIt will be seen that the annual increase of population per 10,000 since 1868 has been 44 for males, 40 for females and 44 for persons, at which rate the male population would be doubled in 156.3 years, the female in 171.9 years, and the total population in 156.5 years. Supposing the same rate of increase to hold good for the next ten years, the population for each year would be in hundreds:\n\n| Year | Persons | Males | Females |\n|------|---------|-------|---------|\n| 1881 | 618,835 | 339,569 | 279,267 |\n| 1882 | 623,479 | 341,141 | 282,338 |\n| 1883 | 628,123 | 342,613 | 285,510 |\n| 1884 | 632,767 | 344,084 | 288,683 |\n| 1885 | 637,411 | 345,557 | 291,854 |\n| 1886 | 642,055 | 347,030 | 294,025 |\n\nThe increase in urban population since 1868 has been slightly greater than that in rural population, the numbers living in 1881 for every 100 living in 1868 being 107 for urban and 106 for total population. The populations of individual towns at the respective enumerations are shown under their several headings in Chapter VI.\n\nWithin the district the increase of population since 1868 for the various tahsils is shown below:\n\n| Tahsil | Total Population | Percentage of Population of 1881 on that of 1868 |\n|--------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| Ludhiana | 280,504         | 106                                           |\n| Jagroon | 149,223         | 106                                           |\n| Samrala | 144,172         | 106                                           |\n| Total district* | 573,899         | 109                                           |\n\n* These figures do not agree with the published figures of the Census Report of 1868 for the whole district. They are taken from the registers in the District Office and are the best figures now available.\nThe question of increase of population is thus discussed by Mr. Walker:\n\n\"Taking the Census figures as correct, we find that there has been a steady increase, which amounted to 11 per cent. in the first thirteen years and to half that proportion in the next thirteen, the rate of increase having been the same in the towns as in the rural population. No safe conclusions can of course be drawn from the figures alone without consideration of the circumstances of the district at the various periods, and these I will proceed to notice. When we annexed the country after the Sutlej campaign of 1845 we found it very fairly cultivated; for our predecessors, the Sikhs, had done their best to increase their revenues by encouraging agriculture; and all the States and Chiefs were under our own protection or that of Lahore. Petty feuds were uncommon, and there was general peace. But the Sikh revenue system was what we should call oppressive; and the rule of some of the chiefs was a mixture of tyranny and rapacity. Property in land was considered a burden, which often under a bad ruler became too heavy to be borne; and society must have been in an unsettled state owing to the frequent changes of rulers. In the same way there was a certain amount of trade; but it was checked by the transit duties levied at short distances by each independent chief, and by the general lawlessness. With our rule came perfect security to the husbandman and to the trader; and an immediate development of the resources of the country by the protection afforded to life and property and the opening out of communications. The increase in cultivation must have been very great in the few years that followed the Summary Settlement of 1847; but there are no details to show what it was. When the survey for the Regular Settlement was made in the years 1850-52 it was found that there was a proportion of 84 acres cultivated in each 100 acres of arable area; and a great part of what remained was brought under the plough within a short time after. Perhaps the best proof of the development of agriculture is the immense fall in prices between 1850 and 1860. The ruler had before that left the peasant just enough to live on, and had taken most of his dues in kind; while the latter knew that the more he cultivated the more he would have to pay, and he had probably as much land under the plough as he could manage. The effects on the population of the development of resources that followed the introduction of our rule would take some time to show themselves, and would naturally appear between the years 1855 and 1868. There was not room for immigration on a large scale, the whole land being owned by the villages; and there was no tendency for settlers to come from any neighbouring district, for the whole country was in much the same condition. The increase of population was all inside the district. The margin of extension has long ago been filled up, the proportion of culturable to cultivated being now one in ten; and the prudential check on population has to some extent come into effect. There has been everywhere a sub-division of holdings, and in most parts of the district the scarcity of land has made itself felt. At all events amongst the Jats and Rajputs every man does not now marry as a matter of course, really I believe on account of the immediate...\"\nexpense; and in most families will be found one or two men who have remained single. It is undoubtedly the case that a state of things equivalent to polyandry prevails amongst the Jats, though it is not recognised as an institution: and the result is a distinct check on population. The Sirhind Canal has just been opened, and the productive power of a large part of the district will thereby be increased. The portions effected by it are those in which the population is now least dense; and it will be necessary for the present cultivators to call in others to their aid. But the whole of the land here also belongs to villages, and is mostly cultivated: and it is hard to say what the process of immigration will be, and whence the settlers will come. I doubt if the result will be to relieve the more thickly populated parts of this district of their surplus population. Except for this opening I should be inclined to say that the population of the district had arrived at the stationary stage, and that the rate of increase in the future would be at all events much smaller than in the past.\"\n\nTable No. XI shows the total number of births and deaths registered in the district for the five years from 1877 to 1881, and the births for 1880 and 1881, the only two years during which births have been recorded in rural districts. The distribution of the total deaths and of the deaths from fever for these five years over the twelve months of the year is shown in Tables Nos. XIA and XIB. The annual birth rates per mille, calculated on the population of 1868, were as follows:\n\n|       | 1880 | 1881 |\n|-------|------|------|\n| Males |      |      |\n| Females |     |      |\n| Persons |    |      |\n\nThe figures below show the annual death rates per mille since 1868, calculated on the population of that year\u2014\n\n|       | 1868 | 1869 | 1870 | 1871 | 1872 | 1873 | 1874 | 1875 | 1876 | 1877 | 1878 | 1879 | 1880 | 1881 | Average |\n|-------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|--------|\n| Males |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |        |\n| Females |     |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |        |\n| Persons |    |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |        |\n\nThe registration is still imperfect, though it is yearly improving; but the figures always fall short of the facts, and the fluctuations probably correspond, allowing for a regular increase due to improved registration, fairly closely with the actual fluctuations in the births and deaths. The historical retrospect which forms the first part of Chapter III of the Census Report of 1881, and especially the annual chronicle from 1849 to 1881, which will be found at page 56 of that report, throw some light on the fluctuations. Such further details as to birth and death rates in individual towns as are available will be found in Table No. XLIV, and under the headings of the several towns in Chapter VI.\n\nThe figures for age, sex and civil condition are given in great detail in Tables IV to VII of the Census Report of 1881, while the numbers of the sexes for each religion will be found in Table\nNo. VII appended to the present work. The age statistics must be taken subject to limitations, which will be found fully discussed in Chapter VII of the Census Report. Their value rapidly diminishes as the numbers dealt with become smaller; and it is unnecessary here to give actual figures, or any statistics for tahsils. The following figures show the distribution by age of every 10,000 of the population according to the Census figures:\n\n| Age Group | Persons | Males | Females |\n|-----------|---------|-------|---------|\n| 0-1       | 355     | 181   | 174    |\n| 1-2       | 181     | 176   | 190    |\n| 2-3       | 196     | 189   | 204    |\n| 3-4       | 231     | 228   | 234    |\n| 4-5       | 269     | 256   | 264    |\n| 5-10      | 1,233   | 1,187 | 1,241  |\n| 10-15     | 1,290   | 1,267 | 1,274  |\n| 15-20     | 1,148   | 1,120 | 1,128  |\n| 20-25     | 957     | 859   | 898    |\n| 25-30     | 859     | 766   | 893    |\n| 30-35     | 805     | 749   | 856    |\n| 35-40     | 660     | 649   | 711    |\n| 40-45     | 716     | 662   | 754    |\n| 45-50     | 349     | 361   | 334    |\n| 50-55     | 530     | 533   | 527    |\n| 55-60     | 147     | 161   | 131    |\n| Over 60   | 555     | 574   | 533    |\n\nThe number of males among every 10,000 of both sexes is shown below. The decrease at each successive enumeration is almost certainly due to greater accuracy of enumeration.\n\nIn the Census of 1881 the number of females per 1,000 males in the earlier years of life was found to be as follows:\n\n| Year of life | All religions | Hindus | Sikhs | Jains | Musalmans |\n|--------------|---------------|--------|-------|-------|-----------|\n| 0-1          | 914           | 907    | 910   | 924    |\n| 1-2          | 878           | 883    | 824   | 805    |\n| 2-3          | 888           | 847    | 746   | 1,018  |\n| 3-4          | 847           |        |       |        |\n| 4-5          | 848           |        |       |        |\n\nThe figures for civil condition are given in Table No. X, which shows the actual number of single, married and widowed for each sex in each religion, and also the distribution by civil condition of the total number of each sex in each age-period. The Settlement Officer wrote as follows in his Census report for the district:\n\n\"Although polygamy is rare, except in the case of very rich men, or of a second wife being taken by karewa, the number of single males is nearly double that of single females. The principal reason given for this is that one family will not give a daughter in marriage to another without either money or an exchange, by which they get a daughter in marriage to a son of theirs. The Jats mostly take money, and the price of a girl is now very high, so that many men have to remain single. But the real causes are that males are in excess of females, and that they marry at a later age. Moreover, a state of things which is practically equivalent to polyandry prevails among the Jats, though not openly recognized as an institution.\"\nIn the uplands the conditions are very favourable to longevity, the climate good and the habits of the people (Hindu Jats mostly) very temperate. There is a little fever every year in the autumn, but the effects of this generally pass away at once. In the lowlands the climate is bad and fever almost universal for 2 or 3 months every year. These different conditions result in longevity in the uplands, while in the B\u00e9t the constitutions of most people are undermined by annual attacks of fever, and they seldom live to a great age. I do not think that religion or the habits of the people do much to produce this result; but, as already observed, nearly the whole population of the B\u00e9t is Muhammadan and of the uplands Hindu. Comparing Sikhs and Muhammadans we find\u2014\n\n|        | Upwards of 60 | Total |\n|--------|---------------|-------|\n| Sikhs  |               |       |\n|        | 7,800         | 123,399 |\n| Muhammadians | 8,559     | 163,897 |\n\nso that the proportion of persons living more than 60 years is greater amongst the former than amongst the latter.\n\nThese remarks apply to the villages. I have not studied the statistics of the town of Ludhi\u00e1na, but I should think that the sanitary conditions and the habits of the people were not favourable to longevity. The situation of the town, just over the B\u00e9t, is unhealthy, and the sedentary habits of most of the population are against it. There are no other circumstances that I know of bearing on the subject of longevity. Early child-bearing is not common, most mothers being at least fifteen years of age when their first child is born.\n\nInfanticide is unknown,* and female children are treated with great care by most classes (the exception, perhaps, being the Rajputs). They are regarded as a valuable commodity by most Jats, Khatri, S\u00fads and the lower tribes. Amongst Jats males are married at about 15, and females at about 12 years of age. Amongst Khatri, S\u00fads and other Hindu tribes, &c., early marriages are common. Muhammadans generally marry at about the same age as Hindus.\"\n\nTable No. XII shows the number of insane, blind, deaf-mutes and lepers in the district in each religion. The proportions per 10,000 of either sex for each of these infirmities are shown in the margin. Tables Nos. XIV to XVII of the Census Report for 1881 give further details of the age and religion of the infirm.\n\nThe figures given below show the composition of the Christian population, and the respective numbers who returned their birthplace and their language as European. They are taken from Tables IIIA, IX, and XI of the Census Report for 1881:\n\n* Note.\u2014Inquiry shows that it almost certainly did exist, as late as 1874, in Raipur and other Jat villages. The Garewals of Raipur and two or three other villages have always considered themselves of a superior class. C. P., page 93.\nBut the figures for the races of Christians, which are discussed in Part VII of Chapter IV of the Census Report, are very untrustworthy; and it is certain that many who were really Eurasians returned themselves as Europeans. The figures for European birthplace are also incomplete, as many Europeans made entries, probably names of villages and the like, which, though they were almost certainly English, could not be identified, and were therefore classed as \"doubtful and unspecified.\" The number of troops stationed in the district is given at page 174, and the distribution of European and Eurasian Christians by tahsils is shown in Table No. VII.\n\nSECTION B.\u2014SOCIAL LIFE.\n\nThe villages of the district are built of sun-dried bricks; but in most will be found one or two houses of masonry. In the ordinary Jat village of the eastern parts the houses are huddled together and open into narrow bye-lanes, which lead into the main thoroughfares. These lanes are seldom more than four or five feet wide. The only entrance to the village is by one or more gates, the number depending on the size of the village; and the people all live inside except the Chamars or other outcaste classes, who are not admitted, and have their houses at a little distance apart or round the site, facing outwards.\n\nThe gates are the property either of the whole village or of a subdivision of it (Patti or Thula), each subdivision having in this case its own. The form is the same in all cases. On each side of the roadway to a distance of 20 or 30 feet a mud platform, 4 or 5 feet in height, is raised; and on these are built verandahs closed on three sides, but open with pillars towards the road. The whole is roofed in (the verandahs and the roadway between them) and a very comfortable place of shelter formed, in which travellers rest and the people meet of an evening. There is sometimes very great elaboration in these gates, and the different Pattis will vie with each other in architectural display. The style of gate is very often a safe test of the condition of a village, but there are few now that have not towards the outside an arch of masonry work, covered with some sort of ornamental design. In a\ngreat many villages the gate is a most commodious structure of solid masonry, which would cost in many cases for a single Patti as much as Rs. 1,000; but everything, including labour, is generally subscribed, wood for beams, cowdung for burning lime, &c., and the only actual expenditure is on the pay of masons. It is on these gates principally that the architectural genius of the villages shows itself. The Settlement Officer says that he has often found shelter from a storm in a village gate amidst a crowd of natives, villagers and travellers, collected with the same object.\n\nThe interior of a village is, as a rule, fairly clean; it is outside that the filth collects. In the eastern parts the cultivated fields come to within a few yards of the houses, leaving very little vacant space. Round the site is the usual road, and outside of this are generally small hedged enclosures (w\u00e1rah or goh\u00e1r\u00e4h) in which the manure heaps are kept, and the women make the cowdung fuel. These enclosures may lie together in a piece of the goer\u00e4h, or waste land adjoining the site, or they may be between the fields and the road. Sometimes a proprietor is reluctantly compelled to devote a few square yards of one of his fields to this purpose. The village ponds (toba) are the excavations from which the clay for building the village have been dug out. They are used for purposes of ablution and for watering the cattle. The drinking wells are generally inside the village. If a few pip\u00e1l trees about the pond be added, we have a complete statement of the surroundings of an ordinary village of the uplands in Samr\u00e1la and eastern Ludhi\u00e1na. These eastern villages are, as a rule, of average size; but to the west, and especially in the Jagraon tahsil along the Ferozepore border, and in the Jangal, the villages are much larger, and the houses more spread out, land not being so valuable. Enclosures for cattle and cowdung fuel are thrown out all round, the lanes are much wider, and there is generally plenty of room round the site. The Muhammadan villages of the B\u00e9t are generally smaller than those of the Dh\u00e1ia, and the sites are more open and straggling. There are no gates, and entrance is possible at almost any point. The takia takes the place of the gate in the Dh\u00e1ia. This is situated outside the village, generally under the shade of a pilkhun tree, and consists of a couple of rooms, built on one side of a mud platform three or four feet high. Travellers rest here; and the people of the village meet; and above all the hukkah is kept going. The takia is in charge of a fag\u00edr whose principal duty is to guard the hukkah and keep it ever alight. A rude mosque is often attached to the takia; and, if there is not one, the people pray in the takia itself. There is generally plenty of room round a B\u00e9t village, the land adjoining the site being often uncultivated; and the w\u00e1rahs or enclosures, are larger than in the Dh\u00e1ia.\n\nThe ordinary house of the Dh\u00e1ia (belonging to a Hindu Jat) consists of a deodhi, or porch, leading out of the lane. On one side of this the cattle are tied and fed at the khurlis, or troughs made of mud; and on the other are the beds of the inmates; or, if the house is a good one, and there is plenty of room inside, the carts are kept here. The deodhi leads into an open courtyard (saha in Hindustani, here called bera) with the same arrangement as the\ndeodhi, the latter being really used when it rains, and the cattle and men ordinarily preferring the open space. Facing the deodhi across the bera is the d\u00e1l\u00e1n or veranda, in front of the rooms (generally two) which are really the house. At one side of the d\u00e1l\u00e1n is the chaunka or rasohi the place where the food is cooked; and at the other side is a koti or press, which is the store-room of the house. The people live principally in the d\u00e1l\u00e1n: and the rooms (kotri) are used for storing grain and all valuables, brass-dishes, &c., and one for the agricultural implements. This plan can be traced in all the Hindu Jat villages; but, while in some of those in Samr\u00e1la tahsil space is so scarce that the bera or courtyard is represented by a mere opening a few feet square in the roof, and the whole house is but one room, the deodhi and back rooms having been united, in the Jagraon tahsil and Jangal villages the houses are very commodious, the courtyard wide and the d\u00e1l\u00e1n backed with four or five rooms. In Samr\u00e1la the village site cannot be extended, and has to accommodate a much larger number of people than it used to. Many houses will be found to cover a space not more than 10 or 12 feet wide, and about 30 deep; and in this are crowded the family and the cattle. In Jagraon and the Jangal there is nothing to prevent the people spreading out, and they are continually doing so, often themselves keeping to the dwelling-houses inside and making a walled enclosure, with a substantial shed, for the cattle outside of the site. In the crowded villages the tops of the houses are much used; and for getting upon them a strong wooden ladder is kept in the lane outside the door, leaning against the wall. Every house has one of these, and the result is to make the passage through some of the villages very awkward for a horseman. The charri and maize stalks kept for fodder are stored on the top of the houses.\n\nThe Muhammadans' houses in the B\u00e9t have no deodhi but merely an open court surrounded by walls four or five feet high, into which the kotri or house opens, generally without a d\u00e1l\u00e1n or verandah. The cooking place, called chuliani is roofed separately. On the bank of the river where there is constant danger of the house being washed away, the people live in huts made completely of thatching (jhao or dib grass), or four walls of mud have a thatching of this on the top of them.\n\nThe furniture of the houses is simple, and consists of a few beds, as many low chairs (called piri) as there are women, spinning wheels (charkha), cotton gins (betna), and a chakki or hand-mill for grinding corn. The women sit on the chairs when spinning, &c. The farming implements are all kept in the house. The grain is stored in the koti, which is a press made of mud against the wall, or in a bokh\u00e1ri which is half sunk in the wall. These presses have an opening with a wooden door in the upper part, and things are put in or lifted out of them. The bharola is a large cylinder of mud, used for storing grain only, with an opening at the bottom, through which the grain is allowed to run when required. These appliances are made by the women. In many houses wooden boxes will also be found, being used for storing clothes principally, also round ones of leather called pati\u00e1r.\nThe cooking and other utensils of the Hindus are almost entirely made of brass, the only ones of earthenware being the water jar (ghara) and a cooking pot for vegetables (tdori). The common dishes are a pr\u00e1t or basin, in which the flour is kneaded; a gad\u00e9wa or lotah, for water; a larger vessel of the same shape called dolni, in which water or milk is kept for use; battlohi a larger vessel, and a g\u00e9gar, larger still, made either of iron or of brass; a th\u00e1li or plate, from which the food is eaten; and a katora or shallow cup from which water or milk is drunk. These dishes are all of brass. The bread is cooked on the common t\u00e1wa or gridle of iron. Kaul is a small cup of brass; karchi a spoon of brass, wood or copper. These with a chimta or tongs, for arranging the fire, and a sand\u00e1si or instrument for lifting a lotah off the fire, make up the usual kitchen utensils of the Jat. Taken altogether they represent a good deal of money. The Muhammadans use an earthenware cooking pot, which they call a h\u00e1ndi. Their other dishes are of earthenware, or of copper tinned amongst the better classes, and have different names from those of the Hindus. They use a kundli or basin for kneading; a tab\u00e1kh or plate for eating out of; a pi\u00e1la (Hindu katora) or cup for drinking, made of earthenware. The copper dishes used are a th\u00e1li or plate, a katora, a gad\u00e9wa or lotah. The t\u00e1wa or gridle is of iron, like that of the Hindus.\n\nThe dress of the people does not differ materially from that of other Punjab plain districts. The Hindu Jat generally wears undyed clothes (one can scarcely call them white), made of home-spun cotton stuff. They consist in the simplest form of three articles, a turban of coarse cloth, a waist cloth (dkoti) and a ch\u00e1dar or cloth worn over the shoulders, the last two being made of khadar or dhotar rather thicker stuff. These, with a pair of shoes made by the village cham\u00e1r, constitute the simple and inexpensive wardrobe of nine-tenths of the Jat population for the greater part of the year. A Sikh substitutes drawers (kach) for the dhoti. On the occasion of a wedding a somewhat better dress is borrowed from a neighbour, who has been extravagant enough to purchase it, and some colour is shown in the pagri the white cloth being tied over one coloured yellow (basanti) or some shade of red (kassumbhi, gul\u00e1bi, &c.) or green, or both are coloured. The people coming from the Jangal with carts affect these coloured pagris, and the mixtures are often tasteful. In the winter the Jat has a blanket of wool, if he can spare Rs. 2 to buy it; otherwise he has a dohar or chaut\u00e1hi, a sheet of very thick cotton stuff, double wove. In the latter case his outfit costs about Rs 3. A well-to-do Jat will have better stuffs and wear a short tight-fitting waistcoat (kurta) and an anga or angarka, or loose long one over this, and a pair of pa\u00edjamahs of country or of English cloth, his turban also being made up of two pieces (a s\u00e1fa on the top of a pagri) of superior cloth, often coloured. If he is a dandy or wants to appear better than his fellows, he will wear a black or coloured coat, made of thick or thin English stuff (broadcloth or alpaca) according to the season; but this is a recent fashion, and the garment is called a \"coat.\" Chogas are also worn.\nThe Jat women wear paij\u00e1mahs (called suthan) made of susi, coloured cotton stuff, and a chadar worn over the head and shoulders, either coloured (young women) or uncoloured, made of g\u00e1ra or dhotar, thick or thin cloth according to the season. This upper garment when coloured may be of dyed cloth, or of phulk\u00e1ri, i.e., worked with silk flowers, or of sil\u00e1ri, another form of silk work; most women also wear a kurta or waistcoat like that of the men. When going to another village, they wear a ghagra or petticoat above the trousers, and a choli or bodice of coloured cloth.\n\nOf the Muhammadans the Gujar and Ar\u00e1in men wear a waist cloth (called tahnat) of uncoloured or more commonly of coloured cloth, or a lungi (a check or tartan). The pagri is generally white. A lungi is also worn over the shoulders, generally blue and white, or red and white. In the cold weather they wear a kh\u00e9\u00e9 or chaut\u00e1hi of the same sort as the Jats. The women do not wear trousers, but a petticoat, generally of blue cloth, a kurta and a shawl, also of blue cloth. The Muhammadan Rajputs dress in much the same way as the Jats, seldom displaying colours. Their women wear paij\u00e1mahs, a kurta and a sheet (ch\u00e1dar) of white cloth. A well-to-do Muhammadan Rajput dresses in almost exactly the same way as a Hindu Jat of the same class.\n\nJewelry is called tag\u00e1da throughout the district, the word sewar not being known. Amongst Muhammadans men never wear jewelry; and amongst the Jats only three pieces\u2014necklaces made of gold and coral beads strung together (m\u00e1hla), bracelets of gold or of silver (kangan), and rings of silver or gold with roughly set stones (mundi). The use of these is confined to such as are better off than the ordinary run; but a Jat will always borrow a pair of bracelets if he can on the occasion of a marriage. Boys up to 9 or 10 wear some ornament round the neck. Jat women have generally a greater display of jewelry than Muhammadans, because they are fonder of show, and also because their husbands are better off and can afford to give them more. A Jat woman in a well-to-do village will turn out for a wedding covered with ornaments of silver, and here and there a piece of gold. The ornaments commonly worn are the same for all classes, except that Muhammadan women will not wear any on their heads. The following is a list of those in general use:\n\n| Where worn | Name | Description | Price |\n|------------|------|-------------|-------|\n| Head       | Chaunk | A silver boss worn on the top of the head | Rs. 9 to 15 |\n|            | Pa\u00fal | A smaller boss of silver, worn one on each side of the head over the ears | 1 to 2 |\n|            | Bandian | A fringe of gold worn across the brow | 30 to 60 |\n|            | Tar\u00e9tian | Amulets of gold worn hanging over the brow (six) | 6 or 7 |\n### Chapter III, B.\n\n#### Social Life.\n\n##### Jewelry.\n\n| Where worn | Name | Description | Price |\n|------------|------|-------------|-------|\n| **Ear**    | Dandian | Earrings and pendants worn in the ears, made of silver. | 6 to 9 |\n|            | Dandian with Pipalvatri | | 12 to 15 |\n|            | Dhedh with chunka or Kophal | | 2 to 3 |\n|            | Hala, Khangri | | |\n| **Nose**   | Nath with chuthi | Silver nose ring with gold pendant, worn in the side of the nose | 20 to 40 |\n|            | Machli | Gold ring for the middle of the nose | 10 to 15 |\n|            | Laong | A gold stud let into the side of the nose | 1 to 3 |\n| **Neck**   | Tandira or has | Necklet of silver | 15 to 20 |\n|            | Maha | Necklace of silver beads | 7 to 9 |\n|            | Hamdi | Ditto of rupees joined together | 15 |\n|            | Chaukia | Ditto of square-pieces of silver | 10 |\n| **Hand and Arm** | Gokru | Silver bracelet | 20 to 30 |\n|            | Kangha | Ditto | 10 to 15 |\n|            | Churiu | Ditto | 20 to 60 |\n|            | Panchi | Ditto made of string beads of silver | 80 to 100 |\n|            | Bazuband | Armlet | 10 to 15 |\n| **Foot**   | Banka, Torai | Silver anklets | 15 to 20 |\n| **Finger** | Angantri, chhalli, mundri | Finger rings of silver | 1 to 3 |\n\nThe workmanship of this jewelry is of the roughest descriptions.\n\nIn the cold weather the food of the common people consists of cakes (chappatti) made of joar (millet) or of maize, a mess of dal, or pottage of moth or mash (pulse), with some green sarson or gram cooked for vegetables (sad). With this is drunk lassi or buttermilk. In the hot weather bread made of wheat or wheat and gram mixed (berra) is eaten instead of maize or millet, with dal or pottage of gram. A man working in the fields will eat one small meal, generally the leavings of the previous day, with some lassi in the morning after he has been working a few hours, and a heavy meal at noon. This food is brought to the field by the women or children. If he is tired and hungry in the afternoon, as he generally becomes in the long days of the hot weather, another small meal is taken about 4 or 5, and the day\u2019s labour is crowned with a heavy meal by way of supper in his house after dark. An able-bodied man working in the fields all day can eat upwards of a seer of grain made into cakes (if he has nothing else to eat with it), the allowance for each woman and child being half seer or less. Vegetables of all sorts, pumpkins, carrots, and radishes, &c., are eaten when in season, and the amount of grain consumed is then less. The Bet people grow and eat kaddus, kakris and\nradishes, while in the Dh\u00e1ia carrots, radishes and green sarson are the usual form of vegetable. The Dh\u00e1ia people are very fond of a mess of Indian corn meal (\u00e1lan) and carrots or sarson mixed, the grain being only about one-third of the whole. On the occasion of a marriage or other ceremony superior food is consumed, and a great deal of sugar in some form or other (gur, shakar, khand, &c.)\n\nThe following note regarding the food of the people was furnished by the district authorities for the Famine Report of 1879:\n\n\"Wheat, gram, barley, jow\u00e1r, Indian corn, form the staple food of the people of this district. They are produced in the seasons rabi or spring, and autumn or kharif, as follows:\n\n\"Rabi or spring.\u2014Wheat, gram and barley are sown in October and November and harvested in April and May, and rain is essential from August to September.\n\n\"Kharif or autumn.\u2014Jow\u00e1r, Indian corn, sown in July and August and harvested in November; rain essential in July and August.\n\n\"Good rain in July and August is advantageous for the operations of both seasons. Excessive rain in August is bad for the kharif and in April for the rabi.\n\n\"The average consumption of grains per annum by a family of five persons is 45 maunds for agriculturists, and 33 maunds 30 seers for residents of towns. Agriculturists eat very little wheat, but live on gram, barley, maize, jow\u00e1r. In June wheat, barley and gram is consumed, and in November jow\u00e1r, maize.\"\n\nThe daily life of the ordinary cultivator is perfectly monotonous, though perhaps not more so than that of any farm labourer at home, rest succeeding toil for most days of the year. A marriage or a fair gives an occasional diversion. The people of the western parts have much more variety and less toil. The youth of the Jagraon and Jangal villages have several games, the principal of which are sonchi and kabadi. In the first of these, which is played throughout the Punjab, one man runs backward, and two follow and try to catch him, he striking them off with his open hands. Kabadi is described in Forbes' Dictionary, and is a sort of prisoner's base. Wrestling is not common. More intellectual amusement is sometimes found in listening to songs sung by one of the people, or by itinerant singers (mir\u00e1s\u00eds or dh\u00e1d\u00eds), who recite the tales of \"H\u00edr R\u00e1njha,\" \"Sassi Punu,\" or such others to the accompaniment of a fiddle (sarangi) or a tambourine (dhad, dhouru). But it is only in the rainy season that the ordinary cultivator has time to listen to these, for he is generally much too tired by the evening to think of anything of the sort. Occasionally a body of Nats or B\u00e1z\u00edgars (strolling acrobats) visit a village, and the people will collect to see the exhibition. But it cannot be said of the agriculturist of the district, Hindu or Muhammadan, that he is fond of any sort of amusement, for his hours of idleness are few, and time is never heavy on his hands.\nThe divisions of the day are as follows:\n\n- \"Amratv\u0113la\" ... ... ...

If a son is born, the father goes at once and informs the p\u0101da or priest, and inquires whether the time is auspicious or not. If it is not, the father must make offerings to the Brahmins. In cases of the worst combination of stars, called gand m\u0101l, the child in former times was thrown out to perish, as it was believed that something would happen to the parents if they kept it. The mother is kept close in the house for 13 days after the birth, when the p\u0101da is called and gives a name to the child, on which occasion he receives Re. 1, and the parohit and others something. Brahmins, faqirs and the neighbours are also fed, and sweetmeats distributed, considerable expense being incurred. This is in token of the purification, that the sutak or impurity is removed from the house. For a further period up to 40 days the mother does not mix with the rest of the people, only with her relations. None of these ceremonials are observed by the Jats in the case of a girl, except that sutak is kept. A Hindu child has no further ceremony by way of baptism, &c., to go through. A Sikh generally takes the palul when he has arrived at years of discretion. The whole of these ceremonials are not strictly observed by the agricultural portion of the community. The name is given to a son in the case of a Sikh by opening the \"Granth S\u0101hib\" and taking the first letter of the page. Other Hindu Jats do not, as a rule, ask the Brahmin p\u0101da for a name, but give one themselves or ask the bhar\u0101t. The period of 40 days' seclusion (called chilla) is not kept unless for some special reason. Amongst the Muhammadans when a son is born the Q\u0101zi or Mull\u0101h (priest) comes on the first to the third day and recites the b\u0101ng or creed in the child's ear, and it receives a name from the priest or from some respectable relative. The mother is impure for 9 days to the members of the household, and for 40 days to the rest of the world. The termination of this period of 40 days is celebrated by a feast (aq\u012bqa). Circumcision (khatna) is performed by the N\u0101i when the Mull\u0101h indicates the proper time, but no age is fixed. The boy is generally 4 or 5, but may be 10 or 15; and if he has grown up he is generally drugged with bhang to deaden the pain of the operation. The N\u0101i is paid, and a small feast given to the relations, who contribute something by way of tambol. In the case of a girl, the days of impurity are\nobserved, but the name is given by any one. The Rajputs generally spends more than the Gujar and Arains on the agiga and circumcision.\n\nThe next ceremony in the life of the child is the betrothal. There are now amongst the Hindu Jats two forms of betrothal, where money is taken by the girl's people, and where it is not (pun). The latter is the only pure form. The girl's parents generally make inquiries beforehand and fix on some family with whom they should like an alliance, and in which there is a boy suitable, the only restriction being that the family does not belong to four gots, with which the parents are already connected. The Nai or Brahmin of the family (lagi) is sent to the house selected and makes the proposal. If it is accepted, he returns in a few days with money and sugar which he has received from the other family. The father of the boy calls the neighbours, and the lagi is seated on a high place with the others all round him by way of doing him honour. The parohit or pada of the family makes the boy say some prayers, and then the lagi puts a mark on the brow of the boy (tilak), and gives him the money and sugar into his lap. This completes the betrothal. It is said that before annexation, taking a consideration for girls was unknown, because the rulers would not permit it; and it is still forbidden in the Nabha State. But now the custom is almost universal, although the transaction is still kept secret, and is never admitted; and only a few of the better families abstain from it. Indeed, a Jat considers the birth of a daughter a piece of luck, for the ordinary price has in recent years run up very high. No wonder that marriage is now considered a luxury, and one wife enough for a whole family. It is almost certain that polyandry is common in practice, and the manner in which the brother claims karewa on the decease of the nominal husband supports this. The girl is considered as purchased by the family, who can seldom afford to pay so large a sum as her price twice over. In the case of a betrothal, for consideration the parents of the child accompany the lagi and a bargain is struck. Part of the price is paid, and the lagi performs the usual ceremonies. Betrothals among the common Jats take place now-a-days when the girl is 10, 12 or even older, for the longer she is kept the higher price she will fetch. Boys are kept till 18 or 20, because their parents cannot collect enough money to pay for a girl.\n\nMarriage under the circumstances generally follows soon after betrothal. If the betrothal is pun, the girl is married at about 9 years of age; otherwise when the money agreed on has been paid. The padas of both parties are consulted and a date fixed. The bridegroom and a few relations go as a marriage party (barat) to the bride's house and the marriage ceremony is performed.\n\nThe ceremonies attending marriage are as follows. A place is marked off (called bedi) with four upright stakes joined with cross-pieces of wood at the top, and inside of this the pair are seated with the Brahmin who celebrates the marriage; and a small fire is lit and kept up with ghi. The Brahmin marks off on the ground with flour what is called a chauk, a square divided into compartments, each representing some deity, and worships this in\nthe name of the bride and bridegroom. When the prayers have been said, the marriage mantar or charm is repeated; and the pair walk round the fire and chauk (ceremony called phera) four times, the women of the spectators singing, and the Brahmin repeating his mantars. This completes the ceremony; and the bride and bridegroom return to the home of the latter. The bride spends a few days there, and then goes back to her parents, with whom she resides till she is finally made over to her husband two or three years after (mukldwa). There is almost no expense over an ordinary wedding; but where the parents are very well-to-do there is a large marriage party, and all the people are entertained at the bride's house, a good deal of money being spent on dancing girls, fireworks, &c., besides. It is also the custom in good families to give with the daughter a dower of cash, jewelry, &c., and, as it is coming to be considered a sign of social rank to be able to do so instead of taking money for her, it is likely that the custom will spread.\n\nAll the clans of Jats practise karewa or widow-marriage. The proceedings on this occasion are very simple. The neighbours are called, including the Lambardars, or respectable members of the village community as witnesses of the ceremony. The Brahmin says a few mantars making a chauk as in a first marriage, and ties the clothes of the parties together. The man then puts a sheet over the woman's head and she becomes his wife. There is no phera, or walking round. It is certain that there is an increasing amount of laxity in the matter of these second marriages, and people live together as man and wife without going through any ceremony. Such conduct is punished by a heavy fine under native rule.\n\nAmongst Muhammadans it is the custom for the parents of the boy to go to the house of the girl selected and make the proposal. If it is accepted, Re. 1 and 11 seers (karchha) of sugar, and some clothes are given to the girl, and also ornaments. The priest (Mullidh) is called, and the girl's father declares the betrothal. The boy's father is given in return a pagri and kh\u00e9s, and is well fed and sent away. The marriage may take place at any time except in the months of Ramzan, Moharram, Shahban. The nafi of the girl is sent with some clothes to the boy's house and announces the date. The boy and his friends go on the appointed day to the girl's house in a marriage party, and the ceremony is performed by the Mullidh; and the dower is fixed at the time of the ceremony. The joh\u00e9z or marriage portion given with the girl by her parents varies according to their means, and consists of clothes, jewelry, &c., sometimes cattle. As with the Hind\u00fas, the girl spends a day or two in her husband's house, and then returns to her parents till she is finally made over (mukldwa) to her husband.\n\nIt is not necessary to give in detail the ceremonies and rites attending the death of a Hindu. These are observed by the Jats more or less fully; the body is burned and the phul or ast, i.e., the partially consumed bones of the hands, &c., collected and sent to the Ganges in charge of a Brahmin, who receives a small fee in addition to his expenses, and also takes 8 annas or Re. 1 to the tirath purshit, or Brahmin on the spot, who in return for this\nthrows the bones into the Ganges, and notifies this fact to the relative by letter. The other relatives of the deceased go about their work after three days' mourning; but the son or other relation whose duty it is to perform the obsequies is shaved and maintains the p\u0101tak or period of purification for eleven days (Hindu Jats). After seventeen days the mourning is over, and the chief mourner celebrates this by a feast to the relations and to the Brahmins, the event being called a hangdmah. Large sums are sometimes spent on this occasion. Like other Hind\u016bs the Jats keep the kandgat or sar\u0101d; and on the day that corresponds with that of the decease of the relation whose obsequies he has to perform, the chief mourner gives food to the Brahmins before he or his family eat any.\n\nAmongst the Muhammdans the ceremonies are simpler. The body is buried with the service enjoined in the Qur\u0101n. On the third day and again on the 40th the chief mourner distributes alms (khairdt); and on the first of these occasions prayers are offered for the deceased.\n\nTable No. VIII shows the numbers who speak each of the principal languages, current in the district, separately for each tahsil and for the whole district. More detailed information will be found in Table IX of the Census Report for 1881, while in Chapter V of the same report the several languages are briefly discussed. The figures in the margin give the distribution of every 10,000 of the population by language, omitting small figures.\n\nThe language of the district is Panj\u0101b\u012b in a very pure form. There are no peculiarities of grammar; but the names of many things are as usual peculiar to the part of the country. The glossary appended to this volume, and the illustrative songs, sayings, &c., which Mr. Walker has published with his Settlement Report, give some idea of the every-day language of the people. As to the character in use, the shop-keepers' books are made out in the usual Lande, illegible save to the writer. A few of the very well-to-do Hindu Jats keep accounts in Gurmukhi. The N\u0101gri character is used by the Brahmins for religious purposes. In the towns the improved Lande, known as Ashraf\u012b, is used by the trading classes. The Persian character is nowhere used by the people for purposes of business.\n\nTable No. XIII gives statistics of education as ascertained at the Census of 1881 for each religion and for the total population of each tahsil. The figures for female education are probably very imperfect indeed. The figures in the margin show the number educated among every\n10,000 of each sex according to the Census returns. Statistics regarding the attendance at Government and aided schools will be found in Table No. XXXVII.\n\nThe distribution of the scholars at these schools by religion and the occupations of their fathers, as it stood in 1883, is shown in the margin.\n\nThe American Mission Press at Ludhiana (see page 76) prints both in English and Vernacular, and issues a newspaper in connection with the Mission.\n\nMr. Walker thus discusses the state of education in the district:\n\n\"The returns of the Census show that of the total population (618,835) 21,920, or 33 in 1,000, either can read and write, or are under instruction; only 552 of this number being females, while one-third belong to the towns. Of the rural population 14,530, or 26 in 1,000, can read and write or are under instruction, and most of these may be taken as belonging to the shop-keeping class, although there are no details to show the proportions in which the various characters are used. Some of the rising generation of agriculturists have received instruction in our schools, and some of the older men who have business transactions keep, as I have said, account books in Gurmukhi; but it may be affirmed that learning is still confined to the official and trading classes. At the same time the district is not backward in comparison with the average of the province. The agricultural population has not as yet come to regard a course of instruction as more than a preparation for Government service, and it is only entered on with this object.\n\n\"The number of those at present under instruction is by the Census tables 4,962 in the whole district; but the educational returns show 4,235 attending Government or aided schools; and to this might be added 4,345 in the private village schools (of which I give an account below), making a total of 8,580. The following statement will show the details of the first of these items, and of the institutions where they attend:\n\n| HIGH SCHOOL, GOVERNMENT | MISSION SCHOOL AT LUDHIANA (AIDED) | DISTRICT GOVERNMENT SCHOOLS | HINDU SCHOOL AT LUDHIANA (AIDED) |\n|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------|\n|                          |                                   | MIDDLE | PRIMARY | FEMALE |                                   |\n| % Attendance             | % Attendance                      | % Attendance | % Attendance | % Attendance | % Attendance |\n| 1                        | 400                               | 1       | 627      | 10       | 294                               |\n|                          |                                   |         |          |          | 49                                |\n|                          |                                   |         |          |          | 2,513                             |\n|                          |                                   |         |          |          | 17                                |\n|                          |                                   |         |          |          | 338                               |\n|                          |                                   |         |          |          | 1                                 |\n|                          |                                   |         |          |          | 123                               |\n\n\"A return prepared recently shows 396 indigenous schools with an attendance of 4,345. These institutions are in Muhammadan...\"\nvillages under the charge of a Mull\u0101h or priest, who gives instruction in the Qur\u0101n to a class of eight or ten pupils seated in the village mosque or takia. The school is called a maqtab. The boys merely learn by rote from the master two or three chapters; but to this is sometimes added a little writing on a slate, and portions of some easy Urdu book (\"Karima,\" \"Kh\u0101likb\u0101ri,\" &c.); and it is only in this case perhaps that the institution can rightly be called a school. The Mull\u0101h, who is also the village priest, has generally a small piece of land given him, or receives an allowance of grain, and also presents at odd times. Lande is taught to boys of the shop-keeping class in the villages by a p\u0101da or master. The boys learn to write on a slate, there being of course no books, as the character is purely commercial. Fees are paid by the parents\u2014Ra. 1 when the boy enters, another rupee when he can write the letters, and so on. Gurmukhi is taught in the Dharm\u015b\u0101las by the S\u0101dh who is probably in possession of an endowment, and also receives presents from the parents. The instruction here too is by slates, the boy first learning to form the letters and then to write from dictation. An advanced boy will sometimes begin to read the Granth or Sikh Scriptures, but the use of books has not yet been introduced. These schools are, it will be seen, of the most elementary character. The following statement will show the number of each sort in the district:\n\n| MUHAMMADAN INSTITUTIONS | HINDU AND SIKH |\n|--------------------------|---------------|\n| In which only Qur\u0101n is taught | In which other instruction is given |\n| Schools | Boys | Schools | Boys | Schools | Boys | Schools | Boys | Schools | Boys | Schools | Boys |\n| 131 | 1,491 | 62 | 587 | 20 | 567 | 141 | 1,410 | 36 | 351 | 5 | 173 |\n\n\"The Muhammadan attendance includes 259 girls. It is likely that many of the pupils in this return would not appear in the Census tables as \"under instruction.\" For example, those learning portions of the Qur\u0101n could scarcely be so designated.\"\n\nThe character and disposition of the people is thus described by Mr. Walker:\n\n\"I have already (see section D of this Chapter) considered the character and disposition of the various tribes which compose the rural population of the district; and I hope I have made it plain that the mass of the people are quiet, contented and law-abiding. The exceptions are the G\u016bjars, perhaps the R\u0101jp\u016bts, the criminal tribes of H\u0101rn\u012bs, &c.; and to these I may add the rabble of the towns. The G\u016bjars are from of old turbulent, and a large proportion of them either actually engaged in crime or on the side of the criminals; but there are at present many respectable men of the tribe. The R\u0101jp\u016bts do not go beyond grumbling. The H\u0101rn\u012bs, Bauri\u0101s and other professional criminal classes are not showing many signs of regeneration...\"\nunder our rule; and to their account a great deal of the crime of the district must be set down. Even with them the amount of crime is not more than normal; and the district will compare favourably with most in the province. There is a daily increasing love for litigation, which is most strongly developed amongst the Jats. The most petty cases are fought out to the bitter end, and both parties freely use suborned witnesses to support their claims. The ordinarily honest peasant appears quite to change his character when he comes into our Courts; but this is perhaps not to be mentioned as a feature peculiar to this district. The use of spirits and drugs is very uncommon amongst the agriculturists, who are a most frugal people. The Gar\u00e9w\u00e1l Jats used to have a reputation for using opium and post, but the custom is disappearing with the last generation. The other Jats and the B\u00e9t people appear to be free from vices of this sort, except that the latter indulge to excess in smoking tobacco. In the towns the S\u00fads and some of the lower classes from down-country consume a great deal of spirits; but the ordinary Hindu and Muhammadan still considers it a sin to do so.\"\n\nTables Nos. XL, XLI, and XLII give statistics of crime; while Table No. XXXV shows the consumption of liquors and narcotic stimulants.\n\nIt is impossible to form any satisfactory estimate of the wealth of the commercial and industrial classes. The figures in the margin show the working of the income tax for the only two years for which details are available; and Table No. XXXIV gives statistics for the license tax for each year since its imposition. The distribution of licenses granted and fees collected in 1880-81 and 1881-82 between towns of over and villages of under 5,000 souls is shown in the margin. But the numbers affected by these taxes are small. It may be said generally that a very large proportion of the artisans in the towns are extremely poor, while their fellows in the villages are scarcely less dependent upon the nature of the harvest than are the agriculturists themselves, their fees often taking the form of a fixed share of the produce; while even where this is not the case, the demand for their products necessarily varies with the prosperity of their customers. Perhaps the leather-workers should be excepted as they derive considerable gains from the hides of the cattle which die in a year of drought. The following extract from Mr. Walker's report sketches the standard of living which prevails among the villagers. The circumstances of the agricultural classes are further discussed below in Section E. (page 89).\n\"If we are to judge by the standard of other parts of the Province I should say that the state of the agricultural population was one of very considerable comfort. They are a simple people, and have few wants. Their food is good, and they have enough of it; and they are, according to Indian ideas, well clothed and well housed; while their fine physique plainly shows that they do not suffer much from deficiency of nourishment, or from exposure to the elements. Amongst the lower menials in the villages (Cham\u00e1rs), and the classes in the towns which subsist by labour (notably the colony of weavers in the City of Ludhi\u00e1na), there is at times a good deal of privation. The Cham\u00e1rs have fixed allowances of grain which are assured to them; but the other classes mentioned receive a cash wage, which is very low, and are sufficiently fed only when grain is cheap.\n\nAmongst agriculturists the Muhammadans, as a rule, are improvident, and live a hand-to-mouth existence; but their possession of the moist lowlands is an insurance against complete failure of the food-supply. The G\u00fajars and Rajputs generally have dealings with the money-lender, and pay him in kind; and this makes it impossible for them to keep stores of grain. Their credit is good, and they can unfortunately raise money whenever they require it on the security of the land, so that they never want for anything. An ordinary house in the B\u00e9t is comfortable, but will not be found to contain much of value in the way of jewelry or dishes. The cattle used for agriculture are very inferior; but the milch kine are good, as there is plenty of grazing ground; and the principal wealth, at all events of the G\u00fajars, consists of their buffalo cows. The Ar\u00e1ins and Aw\u00e1ns mostly get on without incurring debt; and I believe that the number of G\u00fajars and Rajputs who do so is daily increasing. There is also a fair proportion of men of all these classes who are able to advance money on the security of land. I have already referred to the Aw\u00e1ns as keeping carts that work for hire, and some Rajputs have followed their example. The villages of the Ludhi\u00e1na B\u00e9t derive great profit from the proximity of the City, in which there is a ready market for the sale of all sorts of miscellaneous produce. Although the money-lenders may seize on the grain, the straw is left; and in a year of drought this fetches a very high price, the people being able to sell it, and depend on the grass along the river and Budha N\u00e1la for the food of their cattle. At the present time (September 1883) straw is very dear and there is a constant demand for it on the part of the Jangal people. Many villages have sold Rs. 400 or 500 worth within the last few days.\n\nThe Hindu Jat is by nature provident. His house will generally be found to contain valuable property in the way of dishes, jewelry and clothes, besides a sum in hard cash. In the eastern parts the most valuable crops are the cane and maize; and these must be turned into cash soon after the harvest. But even here there is generally enough grain in store to last for a year. In the western villages (Jagraon and Pakhow\u00e1l) the condition of the Jats is more than one of mere comfort. The houses are superior, there is a great display of jewelry and brass dishes, and the cattle are of a very high class. Almost every house contains a supply of...\"\nhard cash; and the Rabi grain of two years (the Kharif does not keep well, and is not stored) is generally kept till the third harvest is secure. A common sign of wealth in a Jat is some masonry work about his house; either an archway, or the whole porch, or even the whole house, is built of burnt bricks. Masonry work is more common in the west than in the eastern parts; but most villages have some house of it. Havelis or mansions belonging to Jats who have made money in service or by trade are springing up in many villages. I have elsewhere given an account of the manner in which the Jats have monopolized the carrying trade. They are able to take up the greater part of the land that is mortgaged, and would have it all, but that there appears sometimes to be a foolish prejudice against a man mortgaging to his sharik or co-sharer, the idea of which appears to be that a man's indebtedness is not likely to be known, and he cannot be twitted with it, if his creditor is of the banking class. I need not do more than allude to the large fortunes made in trade by the mercantile classes in Ludhi\u0101na and the other towns.\n\n\"This state of comfort and prosperity is entirely the growth of recent years. Under the Sikhs the cultivator had little room for saving left; and there was no opening for trade or for remunerative investment of any sort. The prices of agricultural produce were low; and it was not till twenty or twenty-five years ago that the improvement of communications raised them and brought a great deal of wealth into the district. This subject of prices is dealt with in Part II of this report, and it will be seen from what is written there that the great rise took place about twenty years ago, and that the average has remained very high ever since. The increase of wealth of the agriculturist has been accompanied by a good deal of extravagance shown in expenditure on marriage and other celebrations; and the sums commonly spent in this way are double or treble what they were thirty years ago. I have already alluded to the large sums paid for girls. The Jats of the eastern parts do not waste much money on such occasions beyond the actual price; but those of the west spend very large amounts on the celebration, and so do the Rajputs. To an ordinary cultivator in the Jangal or Jagraon villages a marriage in his family often means the expenditure of Rs. 500 to 1,000, even up to Rs. 1,500, and smaller sums go in hangdmahs or funeral feasts.\"\n\nSECTION C.\u2014RELIGIOUS LIFE.\n\nTable No. VII shows the numbers in each tahsil and in the whole district who follow each religion, as ascertained in the Census of 1881, and Table No. XLIII gives similar figures for towns. Tables III, IIIA, IIIB of the Report of that Census give further details on the subject. The distribu-\nfully discussed in Part I, Chapter IV of the Census Report. The distribution of every 1,000 of the Musalm\u00e1n population by sect is shown in the margin. The sects of the Christian population are given in Table IIIA of the Census Report; but the figures are, for reasons explained in Part VII, Chapter IV of the Report, so very imperfect that it is not worth while to reproduce them here.\n\nTable No. IX shows the religion of the major castes and tribes of the district, and therefore the distribution by caste of the great majority of the followers of each religion. A brief description of the great religions of the Punjab and of their principal sects will be found in Chapter IV of the Census Report. The religious practice and belief of the district present no special peculiarities; and it would be out of place to enter here into any disquisition on the general question.\n\nThe general distribution of religions by tahsils can be gathered from the figures of Table No. VII; and regarding the population, as a whole, no more detailed information as to locality is available. But, as already stated, the agricultural population of the eastern part of the uplands is strong in the Hindu and weak in the Sikh element. Religion follows very closely the main division of the Jats, which is sketched in Section D (page 82), and Sikhism has laid hold on those of the western parts and of the Jangal, while to the east the people are mostly Hindu. The following details will show that this is the case:\n\n| Tahsil | Samr\u0101la | Ludhi\u0101na | Jagraon |\n|--------|---------|----------|---------|\n| Hindus | 89,154  | 130,478  | 53,608  |\n| Sikhs  | 16,893  | 63,633   | 48,617  |\n\nThe Hindu population of the Jagraon tahsil is made up of the mercantile, trading and miscellaneous classes inhabiting the towns and following their occupations in the villages; and it may be said that the Jat population is entirely Sikh, the total of the Jat population in the tahsil being about a quarter of that in the whole district (220,000). On the other hand, the proportion of Sikhs is very small in Samr\u0101la; and in the Ludhi\u0101na tahsil, to the east of the M\u0101ler Kotla road, most of the Jats are Hindus, while to the west of it and towards the Jangal they are all Sikhs. From what is said Section D (page 82) of the two types of Jat it will be seen that the adoption of one religion or the other depends in some degree on the mental qualities of the people, which again are the result of locality; but the real cause of the spread of the Sikh religion in the western parts is that this tract was always beyond the power of the Muhammadan Emperors, while in the villages round Sirhind it was easy to check it.\nThe Jat of the east has little time for any religion, and we might expect the form adopted by him to be of a lower order, and more involved in superstition. He keeps his ancestor's religion as he does their system of cultivation; and wants no change, having few ideas beyond his fields. On the other hand, the Jat of the west is independent in his religion as in everything else; and Sikhism is just the sort of faith that would commend itself to his mind.\n\nThe Muhammadan portion of the agricultural population is confined to the B\u00eat and the country just over it, which they hold to the almost total exclusion of Hind\u00fas. They have also villages scattered over the uplands; and the Muhammadan element is very strong in the town of Ludhi\u00e1na.\n\nIt is not necessary to enter into a detailed account of the various Hindu sects, but some mention may be made of the Sult\u00e1n\u00eds, who make up the greater part of the Hindu Jat population. These are the followers of the Muhammadan saint, Sakhi Sarwar Sult\u00e1n, whose tomb is at Nig\u00e1ha, in the Dera Gh\u00e1zi Kh\u00e1n district. Mr. Ibbetson gives his date as of the 12th century. No one has yet been able to find out how and when the worship of the saint spread through this district; but it is said that the Jats brought it with them, and they may well have done so in the case of all immigrations within the last 300 or 400 years. It is probable that the belief spread eastwards in the 15th and 16th centuries, and that at the time of Guru Govind Singh most of the Jats held it, the conversions to Sikhism being from it. The Sult\u00e1n\u00eds are nominally ordinary Hind\u00fas, worshippers of Shiv or of D\u00e9vi; but it is characteristic of popular Hinduism that the saint and his shrine, being something more tangible than the deity, have entirely excluded the latter, and that the saint should have been a Muhammadan. They are, as might be expected, very lax Hindus. An account of the Bhar\u00e1\u00eds, or guardians of the village shrines of Sult\u00e1n (p\u00edrkh\u00e1n\u00e1) will be found in the section on Castes (page 78). These p\u00edrkh\u00e1n\u00e1s have always the same shape\u2014a square base with four small domes at the corners, and in the centre a small temple 10 or 12 feet high. There is a door in front of the shrine; and, facing this, two or three niches for lamps. Otherwise it is empty, there being nothing to represent the saint. The Thursday offerings at the shrine are not universal, and are generally made by the women. The Bhar\u00e1\u00ed attends all that day. It is very common for a person wishing to attain some object (e.g., to succeed in a law suit) to make a vow to the shrine; and offerings in this way also go the Bhar\u00e1\u00ed. Once a year, on a Friday, the ceremony of \"R\u00f3t\" is performed in most Sult\u00e1n\u00ed families. A huge loaf is made of one maund (kachcha) flour and half a maund (kachcha) of gur, and cooked. The Bhar\u00e1\u00ed attends and beats the drum, and sings the praises of the saint while this is preparing; and receives one-quarter of the bread, the other three-quarters being eaten by the family and the neighbours. This is the great observance of the Sult\u00e1n\u00eds, and they really appear to have no others.\n\nThe Ludhi\u00e1na district, and adjoining Cis-Sutlej territories, figure largely in the annals of Sikhism. Guru N\u00e1nak and his successors made many converts in this tract; but it is more famous as the scene of the wanderings and persecution of the great Guru Govind Singh;\nand it was here principally that the religion took its militant form from contact with the Muhammadans. Sirhind, the head-quarters of the Mughal power in these parts, is only a few miles east of the Samr\u00e1l\u00e1 border. It was against this town that the earliest efforts of the Sikhs were directed; and it was here that after the dispersion of the Guru's followers by the lieutenant of Aurangzeb, the wife and children of Govind Singh were murdered\u2014a deed that has made the town accursed to all his followers. It is in this district, too, that the latest development of Sikhism has had its origin under R\u00e1m Singh, K\u00faka. The two religions of the Jats, i.e., the worship (for such it is) of Sult\u00e1n, and Sikhism, do not really differ very much from each other in practice. The ordinary Sikh of the district is a Hindu who reverences the Gurus and their Scriptures, and in token of this has taken the baptism (pahul), and adopts at least some of the signs enjoined by Guru Govind Singh. The Sult\u00e1n\u00ed is a Hindu who has inherited the worship of Sult\u00e1n; but the more intelligent of them see the absurdity of this, and really believe in the Gurus as much as the Sikhs do. Sult\u00e1n\u00eds are constantly taking the pahul or baptism, and the conversion makes almost no difference to them, except that they have to give up smoking. A Sult\u00e1n\u00ed Jat will often say that he did not become a Sikh because his father was not one, and it was not the custom of his family to take the pahul, but that his sons would be Sikhs; and he had really no better reason for his own form of religion, which he admitted to be foolish. Such a distinction as the manner in which sheep and goats ought to be killed for food is not likely to affect a people who never touch flesh, and really consider it a sin to kill any animal. The M\u00e1lwah Sikh of the present day admits the Hindu gods, and follows the Brahmins in everything. He is very unorthodox on most points, but has taken the pahul generally from the hands of some holy man who has visited his village, less often at Amritsar. After this he adds \"Singh\" to his name, if he has not taken it in anticipation, must renounce smoking, and keeps three out of the five \"k's\" enjoined by Guru Govind Singh, viz., the k\u00e9s or long hair, the kanga or wooden comb, and the kach or drawers. There is nothing approaching to bigotry in the disposition of the Sikh Jat; and so much of his faith as is not made of these few external observances, which are after all more of a social than of a religious character, is the religion of humanity preached by the earlier Gurus. A Sult\u00e1n\u00ed will generally call himself a Sikh, and does not seem to recognize much difference between himself and the Guru Sikh, except that the latter cannot enjoy his pipe. Sult\u00e1n is attended to once in the year; and even this is a mere matter of custom. The Sult\u00e1n\u00ed will say that he reveres the Sikh Gurus; and no wonder, for the moral precepts of the Granth might belong to the purest form of religion. The real religion of both Sikh and Sult\u00e1n\u00ed is a belief in one God, and in every-day life there is blind obedience to the Brahmin.\n\nThe most important of the recent revivals in Sikhism is that of the K\u00fakas, which is a protest against the present laxity, and an attempt to restore the political religion of Guru Govind Singh in its purity. \"This sect was founded about 35 years ago by an Ud\u00e1s\u00ed.\"\nfaqir, an Arora by caste, called B\u00e1lak Singh, who lived at Hazaron in the R\u00e1walpindi district. His followers were called Sag\u00edas\u00eds or Habi\u00e1s\u00eds; and after his death in 1863 the movement died away in the western Punjab, but was energetically stimulated in the central and eastern districts by his successor, R\u00e1m Singh, a carpenter of Bhaini in the district of Ludhi\u00e1na. The tenets of the sect proclaimed Govind Singh as the only true Guru, who prohibited all worship save the reading of his 'Granth,' and all employment of Brahmans, and in many ways revived the original doctrines of the Sikh faith. They included the abolition of caste and of restrictions upon intermarriage, abstinence from meat, liquor and drugs, and comparatively free intercourse between the sexes. The sectaries carried staves about in their hands, tied their turbans in a peculiar fashion (S\u00fadhap\u00e1g), wore a necklace of woollen cord tied in knots, and had a watchword known only to themselves. R\u00e1m Singh presently declared himself to be an incarnation of Guru Govind Singh, and preached the revival of the Kh\u00e1lsa and the overthrow of the English Government. His followers used to meet by night for the purpose of drill, while, as usual in such cases, a good deal of religious hysteria was excited, and ended in much sexual license. The attention of Government was attracted to these proceedings as early as 1863, and shortly after this date the sect began to be known as K\u00fakas, or 'shouters,' a name which has now superseded their original designation. For several years these people did nothing worse than defile or destroy shrines and idols, and murder butchers and others whom they suspected of slaughtering kine; but as early as 1869 there was a small K\u00faka outbreak in Ferozepore which seems to have had a political object; and in January 1872 the K\u00faka rising in M\u00e1ler Kotla took place, which ended in fifty of the ring-leaders being blown away from guns, some thirty more being executed, and R\u00e1m Singh being deported. The sect cannot be said ever to have attained any general popularity; its followers have throughout been drawn almost exclusively from the lowest classes, their attacks upon sacred places have outraged the feelings of their neighbours, while the pure morality which they at first preached has been superseded by the most unbridled license under the name of religious enthusiasm, men and women dancing naked together and indulging in orgies which have alienated the sympathies of the more decent portion of the community.\" The above account of the K\u00fakas is taken bodily from Mr. Ibbetson's Census Report. To it the following particulars may be added. R\u00e1m Singh was born in Bhaini Ala, 14 miles east of Ludhi\u00e1na, about the year 1820, the son of Jassa, a carpenter. He was at one time in service in the Kh\u00e1lsa army at Lahore; and, on giving this up, established a shop at Ludhi\u00e1na. This failed, and he worked as a carpenter in his own village and at Ludhi\u00e1na. Then he took to wandering about the country plying his trade; and finally became the disciple of B\u00e1lak Singh in Hazaron. When he had established some reputation, he settled down at Bhaini between 1850 and 1860, and thence disseminated his doctrines. The sect increased rapidly, and followers came from all parts, never empty handed. He was soon able to set up a large D\u00e9r\u00e1h; and at the\ntime of his arrest in 1872 used to go about followed by a large retinue and in great state. It is very doubtful whether it can be said that even the majority of the Kukas are drawn from the lowest classes, for the sect has made much more progress amongst the Jat Sikhs than any returns would show. The excesses committed by a small body of fanatics in 1872 were probably disapproved of by the sect at large. The principal outward signs of the faith are the straight pagri and the woollen cord (mehla); but since the outbreak of 1872 (of which an account will be found elsewhere) the first of these is not worn by many Kukas; and the cord is kept under the clothes instead of outside, as it ought to be. A dispensation from the Dera (where Budh Singh, brother of Ram Singh, resides) is easily obtained; and it is evidently the intention of the sect to give up all the outward marks of their faith so long as they are persecuted. A Kuka would call himself a Sikh unless he were well known to be a Kuka; and probably only a very small proportion of the followers of Ram Singh have been returned as more than Sikhs, which of course they are. The truth is that it is not possible for a Kuka to be a loyal subject of the British Government, as the avowed object of Guru Govind Singh, whose incarnation Ram Singh professes to be, was a temporal kingdom; and the establishment of this under Ram Singh is the first element in the faith of the sect. It is not to be expected then that any man, unless he were prepared to break with society and give his enemies a constant hold on him, would admit that he belonged to the sect; and most Kukas would at the present time, even if asked the question directly, deny their faith.\n\nThe Muhammadans of the district are almost all Sunnis, 99 per cent. of them being so returned. No account need be given here of the tenets of the three sects. The Jats, Rajputs, Gujars, Arains, Dogars are all converted Muhammadans; and their conversion was probably forcible, so that we should not expect them to be very strict, or their religion to be more than skin deep. They say their prayers when they have time; and generally keep the fast of Ramzan. The Muhammadan Rajputs are probably the most foolish in their religion, and most superstitious of all tribes in the district; and will believe in anything. The Awans came to the country as Muhammadans, and are strong in their religion, most villages turning out several Maulvis learned in the law. They are, like the other Muhammadan tribes, guided by custom on questions relating to land; but, after the Settlement Officer had attested their tribal code in 1882, a very strong representation was made to him to the effect that, although customs contrary to the Muhammadan law had established themselves, the tribe now wished to enter into an agreement for the future strictly to abide by the latter.\n\nMention has been made of the shrine of Sakhi Sarwar in Dera Ghazi Khan. This is a very favourite place of pilgrimage for people of both the Hindu and Muhammadan religions, but principally for the Sultani Hindus. Bodies of pilgrims start from the district in charge of the Bhardis in the month of Phagun (March), and return in Chet (April), the journey taking about six weeks.\nif performed on foot, as it generally is. Offerings are made at the shrine of money, clothes, &c., without any special ceremonies; and three or four days are spent there. A r\u014dt is often made (see page 66 ante). It is said that leprosy used to be cured by a visit to this shrine; but generally a man gets whatever he wishes by making the pilgrimage, or goes on it to fulfil a vow.\n\nHindus of all tribes go from this district to the temple of D\u00e9vi at Jaw\u00e1la Mukhi in the Kangra district. They are accompanied by their families, while, as a rule, men only go to Sakhi Sarwar. There are four seasons appointed in the year for this pilgrimage, the principal ones being in March and September. Offerings are made at the shrine, and the hair of the children cut off and left there. Some also go to Naina D\u00e9vi; and the Sikhs reverence this shrine because \"Guru Govind\" spent some time at it. The road to Jaw\u00e1la Mukhi lies through Hoshiarpur, and to Naina D\u00e9vi through R\u00e1hon or R\u00fapar.\n\nHindus also go from this, as from other districts, to the Hardw\u00e1r fair, especially for the Kumbh, which comes every 12 years; and the Sikhs to the Harmandar Ji or temple at Amritsar, for the Bais\u00e1khi and Diw\u00e1li fairs, but not in any great numbers, and more probably with a view to purchase of cattle than of worship.\n\nThe next three places of pilgrimage to be mentioned lie in the Umballa district near Th\u00e1nesar, within what is said to be the circle where the last great battle between the Kaurus and P\u00e1ndus was fought. Kulchetar (\"Kurukshetra\"\u2014Cunningham) is close to Th\u00e1nesar town; and, when there is an eclipse of the sun, crowds of pilgrims go there and bathe, the day having been duly notified by the Brahmins. Pihewa is 12 or 14 miles further on; and a great fair is held there on the last day of the Hindu year (Ch\u00e9t Chaudas), when the people bathe in the Sarusti stream, which runs close at hand. Besides this, when any one dies an unnatural death\u2014by snake-bite, by accident, &c., in fact in any other than the orthodox way of being put on the ground\u2014the funeral obsequies have to be performed by the Brahmins of Pihewa, to whom presents are made. When the last day of the Sar\u00e1d or Kan\u00e1gat (the period of 15 days during which a Hindu worships his deceased ancestors) falls on a Monday, a religious fair is held at Phalgu, where there is a tank in which the pilgrims bathe. This fair was held in 1868, 1880, and will now be held in 1883. There is a constant stream of pilgrims to Pihewa, for a Hindu or Sikh must go there if the person whose obsequies he is bound to perform has died an unnatural death. All the Hind\u00fas and Sikhs of the district alike go to these three fairs, crowds of them to the eclipse fair at Kulchetar.\n\nA few Muhammadans go to the fair of the saint Pir Banohi held at Sun\u00e1m in Pati\u00e1la; one in 10,000 goes to Mecca; a great many go to Sakhi Sarwar, but the pilgrimage is essentially a Hindu institution.\n\nThe Ch\u00e9t Chaudas fair of the Hind\u00fas is held at four places in the District\u2014Ludhi\u00e1na, M\u00e1chiw\u00e1r\u00e1, Gadow\u00e1l and Sidhw\u00e1n. The first three of these are over the Budha N\u00e1la, and the fourth close to the river. Hind\u00fas come, bathe, walk about, and then go quietly home. Some 30,000 from the villages come to Ludhi\u00e1na, and about 10,000 to M\u00e1chiw\u00e1r\u00e1.\nThe Roshani Fair is held at the shrine of a saint Pir Abdul Quadir Jalani (called generally \"Pir Sahib\") which lies in the open space between the Fort and City of Ludhiana. This is a Muhammadan fair; but the Hindus of the City join in it. It is held on the 9th\u201411th of the Muhammadan month of RabiulSani (called Miranji); and thus falls on a different date every year. The Muhammadans come from all the villages round, make offerings, and pay their respects to the shrine. There is a peculiar custom of bringing cattle and keeping them tied up at the shrine all night for good luck, this being called chauki, i.e., the cow or buffalo \"watches\" at the shrine. The fair is attended by 40,000 to 50,000 people from the villages; and the offerings, which are taken by a family of Sofis, amount to Rs. 300 or 400. The name \"Roshani\" is derived apparently from the tomb being illuminated at night during the fair.\n\nThe Bhaiwal\u00e1 (Bhaib\u00e1l\u00e1) Fair is held in a piece of waste land of D\u00e1d, a village close to Ludhiana. It falls in the month of M\u00e1g\u00e1h (10th Sudi), or about January; and is in honour of a disciple of Guru N\u00e1nak, called B\u00e1la. There is a Sam\u00e1dh and also a tank; and Hindus go and make offerings of money, grain, &c., which are taken by the massands or guardians (Khattri Sikhs of Kudh\u00e1n\u00ed, Patiala territory). The people also make curds overnight and take them to the fair, where they eat or distribute them after presentation to the shrine; and it is the duty of every one to scoop out several handfuls of earth, originally no doubt with a view of increasing the size of the tank. The fair lasts one day, and some 10,000 people attend it.\n\nThe Sadlakhan Fair at Chhap\u00e1r, on the southern border of the district, is also an important one. It is held in the month of Bh\u00e1don (September) in honour of \"G\u00faga\" (for an account of whom see Cunningham's Arch. Survey, Vol. XIV, pages 79-86); and there is a large shrine, or M\u00e1ri, in his honour. The local account generally given of G\u00faga is that he was a snake, and changed his form to that of a man in order to marry a princess. Afterwards he returned to his original shape; but in the meantime acquired a great kingdom and won renown, which has come down to the present time. The dh\u00e1d\u00eds, or itinerant minstrels, make up stories about G\u00faga as they go; and it is impossible to say what he was originally. The fair is a Hindu one, but Muhammadans also attend; and some 50,000 people assemble. Offerings are made at the shrine, which are taken by the resident Brahmins, and these amount to some Rs. 300 a year. As at the Bhaiwal\u00e1 Fair, the people scoop out the earth, and cattle are also brought to be blessed as in the Roshani Fair. The shrine is reputed to have the power of curing snake-bite, and it is said that a person bitten will recover if put beside it. Perhaps this reputation is due to the traditions about G\u00faga, in all of which there is something about snakes.\n\nThe only other fair worthy of mention is that of Bure Sh\u00e1h, or Makiphan, held at J\u00e1ngpur (Jagraon tahsil) in September when the maize is ripening. It is a Muhammadan fair really, and Muhammadan faq\u00edrs collect from all parts, but the Hindu Jats also come in great numbers. Altogether some 10,000 attend. The fair is held\nat night, and the people light lamps at the shrine and make small offerings, which are distributed amongst the fagirs.\n\nA great feature in the Jat villages of the uplands is the Dharm\u00e1s\u00e1la, an institution partly religious, partly charitable, in charge of an ascetic or S\u00e1dh of the Ud\u00e1si or of some other order. This is endowed with a grant of land, either out of the village common, or from some private individual. It is the duty of the S\u00e1dh to spend all that he gets from the land or by begging in feeding the poor, keeping the Langar or alms-house going. Where, as in most cases, the occupant is an Ud\u00e1si, he or one of his disciples (chela) also reads the Granth or Sikh scriptures. In the larger institutions of this sort the S\u00e1dh and his chelas make up a college, the former being called the Guru or father of the chelas and the Mahant of the institution. The chelas collect money and sometimes set up in other villages similar institutions, affiliated to the original one. In former times the reputation of these Dharm\u00e1s\u00e1las was very great, and few villages were without one; but their treatment in our times has resulted in the closing of most of the old ones. The grants of land were of course intended for the support of the institution; and under Sikh rule if a S\u00e1dh misbehaved he was at once turned out. But at the Regular Settlement the incumbent was in every case returned as owner of the land, which was at the same time exempted from revenue for the period of Settlement. The result of this has been that the S\u00e1dh has in most cases taken a wife, closed the Dharm\u00e1s\u00e1la to the public, and he or his children are now mere landed proprietors, with a very comfortable house built at the public expense. In some cases the S\u00e1dh has not actually married, but taken to evil courses; and the people are powerless to prevent his misappropriating the receipts. Mr. Walker quotes instances in which a Dharm\u00e1s\u00e1la of great repute has thus been ruined by a profligate S\u00e1dh, who retained the land and house; and the villagers have actually had to create another endowment and build a new Dharm\u00e1s\u00e1la. There was a very famous alms-house at Jassow\u00e1l with endowments which amounted to several hundred acres, most of them unfortunately held revenue-free in perpetuity; and this has now fallen into the hands of a worthless character, and is closed to the public.\n\nThere are two or three famous Langars or alms-houses well known throughout the country. That of B\u00e1gr\u00edan lies 40 miles south of Ludhi\u00e1na and is administered by a resident family of Takh\u00e1ns (called Bh\u00e1\u00eds), who hold in j\u00e1gir two or three villages in our territory and more in Pati\u00e1la and the other States, besides owning a large area of land. Numbers of travellers are fed daily from the public kitchen, which is open to all comers; and about 1,000 maunds of grain are distributed to the public annually. The derah, or building, is a very extensive one. The family has always been in the habit of marrying, and the son succeeds as manager. The present Bh\u00e1i, Narain Singh, is a gentleman of note and an Honorary Magistrate in his own large village of B\u00e1gr\u00edan. This Langar was kept open in the worst years of drought (1862 and 1868), when the smaller institutions throughout the country were closed, and afforded relief to numbers of the poorer classes.\nwho flocked to it in search of food. There is also a large Langar at Jaspal Bangar, near Ludhiana, which is kept by a family of Udasi faqirs, whose custom is also to marry. This is an ancient institution, the first endowment having been made in the time of the Emperor Mahomed Shah, and successive rulers having added others, till they have grown to some 800 acres. The present Mohant is Partab Das; and he appears to do his best to keep up the institution, which is held in great repute. His father, Gulab Das, is said to have died deeply in debt in consequence of his expenditure in keeping the Langar open in the years of scarcity. The Heran (Jagraon tahsil) Langar is held by an Udasi ascetic; and, although its endowments are not so large as those of the other two, it is almost as well known. The present Mohant, Gursarn Das, is said to have distributed in the famine of Sambat 1917 (1862) 8,000 maunds of grain which his predecessor had stored, and to have invited the starving people from all quarters, sending no one empty away.\n\nA whole book might be written about the religious observances, superstitions, &c., of the people; but it will suffice here to refer to a few points in connection with this subject, which will serve as illustrations of the popular forms of belief.\n\nHindus and Sikhs, except Kukas, are greatly ruled by Brahmins. Every one has a parohit or priest for every-day life, and a pada or superior priest (who must be a learned man, read in the Scriptures) for marriage and other celebrations. Whatever observances a Brahmin enjoins must be performed; and there is often a good deal of tyranny, hard penances being ordered for trifling faults. The Muhammadans have not the same necessity for priests in every-day life; but it is scarcely their own fault that they are so free, for they would readily believe anything; and this appears to be the only point of superiority in their every-day religion over that of the Hindus, that they are not allowed to indulge in rites and superstitions to the same extent.\n\nIt may be interesting to note a few of the more common superstitions connected with agriculture. A Jat must, before he begins to prepare his fields by ploughing for any harvest, ask the Brahmin whether the land is awake or asleep. If he is told that it is asleep, he must wait six days till it awakens. Then he may go on ploughing it whenever he likes. He must begin to sow any crop or harvest on Wednesday, and to cut it on Tuesday; and these rules are never departed from. Certain sorts of cattle must not be bought on certain days of the week\u2014a buffalo on Tuesday, a cow or ox on Wednesday; and the prejudice against these days is not peculiar to the Hindus, as the Muhammadans appear to act on it. The observances attending the construction of a new well are elaborate. The Brahmin is asked to mention a lucky day and hour, and at the appointed time the digging of the well is commenced, and the chak or wooden frame put into the ground. The Brahmin ties a string to the chak and says some prayers, and then gar is distributed to the on-lookers. When the well is ready, the Brahmins are again called and fed, as well as any stray faqirs that there may be about, and not till this has been done is the well used.\nThe belief in ghosts and other supernatural agents is universal, and shared by Hind\u00fas and Muhammadans alike. The malevolent spirits usually recognized are *bhuts* and *chur\u00e9ls*. A *bhut* is said to be the spirit of a man who has died *av-ghat*, i.e., not on the ground and according to the proper ceremonies; while a *chur\u00e9l* is the spirit of a woman who has died within 40 days of childbirth or *av-ghat*, as in the case of a man. Funeral ceremonies performed at Pi\u00f1ewa set the spirit at rest. If an evil spirit is offended, it takes possession of the offender and works ills, bodily and mental. It may be expelled by a piece of red pepper put in the nose of the sufferer, or by inhaling the smoke of burnt rags. If this does not succeed, the patient may be taken to the shrine of Pir Banohi at Sun\u00e1m, and the spirit exorcised. Another form of exorcism is that a lamp is moulded of dough, filled with oil and kept burning beside the patient. A girl sits feeding the lamp, and is asked what she sees in the lamp from time to time. She invents several things, and then says she sees a Darb\u00e1r with people sitting in it, and amongst them the *chur\u00e9l*. On this the oil is carefully poured into a jar or bottle and corked up, the *chur\u00e9l* being, of course, in it. Men and women are said to have the power, by repeating a certain charm, which few happily know, of extracting the liver from a child, thus causing its death. Such an unpleasant person is called a *D\u00e1n*; and if he or she looks at a child, death is the result. A *Deo* is an ordinary spirit who haunts old wells, pipal trees, and dark places generally. He is an orthodox ghost apparently, and many weird stories are told of him.\n\nSacred groves are to be found in some villages. The superstition about them generally is that they mark the spot where some holy man has become a *Sidh*, i.e., been absorbed in the deity; and no one of the villagers would dare to cut even a twig of the wood. *Faq\u00edrs* and other holy men are allowed to take what they want for their own use; but the people believe that death would follow any such sacrilege committed by themselves. The *Sidh* is, strangely enough, supposed still to reside in the grove.\n\nThe following account of the well known American Mission at Ludhi\u00e1na has been kindly contributed by the Rev. E. M. Wherry, the head of the institution:\n\n\"This mission, with outstations at Jagraon, Morinda and R\u00fapar, is connected with the American Presbyterian Church in the United States of America, and controlled by a Board with its head-quarters at New York. Ludhi\u00e1na having been the first point occupied by the Society in India, gives its name to the Mission, including principal stations in the following cities of the Punjab and North-West Provinces: R\u00e1walpindi, Lahore, Jullundur, Hoshiarpur, Ludhi\u00e1na, Ferozepore Umballa, Sub\u00e1thu, Sah\u00e1ranpur and Dera D\u00fan.\n\nThe Mission was established at Ludhi\u00e1na in 1834, the Rev. John C. Lawrie, D.D., being the first missionary. He was, however, unable to remain more than one year, when he was succeeded by the Rev. John Newton, the veteran missionary of Lahore. He arrived in 1835, bringing with him a wooden press, the first ever seen in this part of India. With this began the establishment now known as...\"\nthe Ludhiana Mission Press, which publishes books in all the languages and characters used in this province.\n\nThe principal agencies used in the Mission work, beside preaching, are: (1) the High School for boys, established in 1834, with several branches in the city, opened later in its history; (2) the Press already noticed, at which is published a weekly vernacular newspaper, entitled the *Nur Afsh\u00e1n*, printed in Persian Urdu, 8 pages 4to royal, circulation 750 weekly; (3) a Christian Boys' Boarding School, established in 1875 at Lahore, but transferred to Ludhi\u00e1na in 1877. It was suspended for three years, but re-opened in 1883. Extensive buildings are being erected with a view to the establishment of a High School.\n\nFor many years an Orphanage for girls and a Dispensary with a missionary doctor in charge, but both these are now suspended.\n\nA Church was organized in 1837, with which is now connected a community of Native Christians, numbering 250 souls. The sons and daughters of this Church are found in every part of North India, employed in other Mission Stations. An extensive itinerant preaching work is carried on in the district, and a good deal of work is done in the city by means of chapel services, street preaching, and teaching of women in the Zan\u00e1na and Girls' Schools.\n\nIn 1845 the Mission Press, with all the books in the Depository, was burned down. The loss was made good by the liberality of the European public in India. In 1857 every building connected with the Mission, excepting two dwelling houses, was burned up by mutineers from Jullundur, assisted by the rabble of the city. Indemnity was paid by the authorities, a tax being levied on the city for the purpose. Fortunately all the Missionaries and Native Christians were enabled to escape with their lives.\n\nThe present European staff is as follows: 3 missionaries and their wives, 2 unmarried ladies, 3 native ordained ministers, 4 native unordained preachers, 14 native Christian teachers and 10 non-Christian teachers. About 120 persons are employed in connection with the Press.\n\nThe influence of this Mission upon the people of the city and province has been very considerable. A large proportion of the men in the city are now able to read and write the vernaculars, and multitudes can speak or read the English language as well. The pupils of the Mission are found in every office in the Punjab, and the first Native Civil Servant (Covenanted) of the province was educated for College in the Mission High School. Two per cent. of the female population were under instruction in Mission Girls' and Zan\u00e1na Schools in 1883. The result of the school work and the influence of the Press have been the awakening of thought in many minds. Prejudices against the Christian religion have been softened; while a fair degree of success in the way of conversions has been obtained.\n\nMention should also be made of the work of the ladies connected with the London Society for the Promotion of Female Education in the East, with which is connected a large Boarding School for girls. Seven European ladies connected with this Society carry on girls'\nschools and zan\u0101na work; conduct a Hospital for women, besides teaching in the Boarding School already mentioned.\n\nThe clumsy wooden press mentioned above was the first printing press ever established in the Punjab. Since its institution in 1835 Books, Tracts, and Sacred Scriptures have been scattered broadcast over all parts of India\u2014in Persian, Urdu, Hindi, Panjabi and Kashmiri. Some idea of the zeal of the missionaries may be had from the fact that the total number of 25,000 Books and Tracts, with portions of Scripture, were given away at the Hardwar fair in the year 1844. Early in 1845, the press, with all the stock in hand, was burnt down; only the wooden press and a portion of the type escaping the fire. However, friends in India came forward, and contributed a sum, not only sufficient to cover the Rs. 20,000 lost, but also enough to enable the missionaries to publish a number of books besides. During the following three years, 68,000 volumes were published; new fonts of English, Hindi and Panjabi type were obtained, so that the Press was enabled to undertake a large amount of work for the public, besides printing the books published by the Mission. Among the works thus published for public benefit were the Panjabi Grammar, idiomatic sentences in English and Panjabi, and a Panjabi Dictionary, published in 1854. These books are still the only resource of Her Majesty's officers who must acquire the Panjabi language, for which they are indebted to the Venerable Dr. Newton and the martyred Janvier.\n\nIn 1857 the Press was again burnt down by the mutineers, and the Depository on the Mission premises, with its contents of many thousand volumes of books for distribution, was reduced to ashes, its broken and blackened walls alone remaining. The greater part of the loss incurred at this time was made to the Mission by a tax levied on the city, and so we find the Press in full operation again in 1858. From that time to the present, the work of this institution has been carried on with scarcely any kind of interruption. Books and Tracts have been published by the thousand every year, under the auspices of the various Bible and Tract Societies, American and English. The first complete edition of the New Testament in Urdu was published in 1865, and the whole Bible in 1868. The latter year saw also a complete translation of the New Testament printed in Panjabi.\n\nUp to the year 1870 the Mission had supplied all publications, except the complete Scriptures, to missionaries, free of all cost, the missionaries usually giving them to the people gratis. The question as to the wisdom of this policy was then raised, as it became evident that large quantities of Scriptures and Tracts found their way into the bazars, where they were sold merely as waste paper. The result of the discussion was that the policy of selling almost all books at a nominal price, just large enough to prevent their being purchased as waste paper, was adopted. The expectation was that the number of books distributed would be very much less than in previous years. But it is a matter of record that the largest number of volumes ever printed in a single year at Ludhiana was issued in the year 1872, the number being 187,000.\nIn 1873 a vernacular newspaper in Urdu\u2014semi-religious and entitled the *Nar Ashan*\u2014was started by the Rev. E. M. Wherry, of Ludhiana. At first it contained but 4 pages of reading matter, but it was soon enlarged to 8 pages. It has now a weekly circulation of about 700 copies, and is read by all classes of people in all the principal towns of the province, as well as in some distant cities of the Empire. Though it is a religious journal, and has a special reference to the Muslim controversy, it depends for the most part on non-Christian patronage, and, with the aid of an annual grant of paper given by the Punjab Religious Book Society, it is supported free of cost to the Press.\n\nThe whole number of Scriptures and portions printed since 1834 in Urdu, Hindi, Panjabi, Persian, Kashmiri, Sindhi and other dialects, has been nearly six hundred thousand; whilst the number of books and tracts aggregate nearly five millions.\n\nThe Ludhiana Christian Girls' Boarding School was established in 1871, with the view of training Native Christian girls as teachers. They are taught the vernacular and a little English, Government text books being used for the most part. In 1882 there were 37 boarders and 29 day scholars, besides 11 little boys who have since been transferred to the American Mission School. Muhammadan and Hindu girls are admitted if willing to conform to the rules of the school; but no separate arrangements are made for them on account of their religion. The staff consists of two English ladies, a matron, two pupil teachers, and a pandit. The school was established by the Society for Promotion of Female Education in the East.\n\n**SECTION D.\u2014TRIBES AND CASTES.**\n\nTable No. IX gives the figures for the principal castes and tribes of the district, with details of sex and religion, while Table No. IXA shows the number of the less important castes. It would be out of place to attempt a description of each. Many of them are found all over the Punjab, and most of them in many other districts, and their representatives in Ludhiana are distinguished by no local peculiarities. Some of the leading tribes, and especially those who are important as landowners or by position and influence, are briefly noticed in the following sections; and each caste will be found described in Chapter VI of the Census Report for 1881.\n\nThe Census statistics of caste were not compiled for tahsils, at least in their final form. It was found that an enormous number of mere clans or subdivisions had been returned as castes in the schedules, and the classification of these figures under the main heads shown in the caste tables was made for districts only. Thus no statistics showing the local distribution of the tribes and castes are available. But the general distribution of the more important land-owning tribes is sketched in the following pages. Mr. Walker, from whose report the description about to be given of the several castes is taken, thus classifies the population of the district:\u2014\nThis leaves 56,212, or 9 per cent. of the whole population unclassified.\n\nThe table given on the next page, taken from the Appendix to the Report in the Revised Settlement, shows the distribution of land and revenue among the chief agricultural castes of the district.\n\nThe Brahmins of the district are scattered all over it. They are seldom to be found engaged in trade, and for the most part live on the Jats of the uplands, few villages being without two or three families; but their services are also required by the Hindus of the large towns. They are of the usual subdivisions of S\u00e1rs\u00fat Brahmins, and no detailed account of them is necessary. The Hindu (Sult\u00e1n\u00ed) Jats perhaps pay them more attention than the Sikhs, but even the Muhammadan R\u00e1jp\u00fats make use of their services on occasions.\n\nThe principal ascetic classes included under the general term faq\u00edr are:\u2014Bhar\u00e1\u00eds (5,590). The Hindu Jats of the eastern parts are almost all Sult\u00e1nis by religion; and outside of each village there is a small P\u00edr Kh\u00e1na or shrine erected in honor of Sakhi Sarwar Sult\u00e1n; and this is in charge of a Bhar\u00e1\u00ed or guardian, who is a Muhammadan, and is not a celibate. These men are said to be Sh\u00e9kh\u00eds, because they belong to no other tribe. Every Thursday they go to the shrine in the evening, light a lamp and beat a drum at it. The people make small offerings of cash, grain, &c., (chard\u00e1wa), which the Bhar\u00e1\u00eds take. They also receive small presents at other times and accompany the pilgrims who go to visit the tomb of the Saint Sult\u00e1n in the Dera Gh\u00e1zi Kh\u00e1n district. There is generally a small plot of land, half-an-acre or so, attached to the village shrine, of which the Bhar\u00e1\u00ed gets the produce.\n\nThe Ud\u00e1s\u00eds (2,366) are Sikh ascetics of a sect founded by the eldest son of Guru N\u00e1nak (Sr\u00edchand). They are mostly Jats by origin, the ch\u00e9lta or disciple and successor being usually chosen\n### Chapter III, D.\n\n**Tribes and Castes.**\n\nStatistics and local distribution of tribes and castes.\n\n---\n\n#### Distribution of Land among the Agricultural Tribes.\n\n| Name of Village | Area (Acres) | Revenue (Rupees) |\n|-----------------|--------------|------------------|\n|                 |              |                  |\n\n#### Muhamma-dass\n\n| Name of Village | Area (Acres) | Revenue (Rupees) |\n|-----------------|--------------|------------------|\n|                 |              |                  |\n\n---\n\n#### Harpur\n\n| Name of Village | Area (Acres) | Revenue (Rupees) |\n|-----------------|--------------|------------------|\n|                 |              |                  |\n\n---\n\n#### Ludhiana District\n\n| Name of Village | Area (Acres) | Revenue (Rupees) |\n|-----------------|--------------|------------------|\n|                 |              |                  |\nfrom this tribe, and are to be found in possession of the *dharm\u00e9d\u00e1s* in Hindu villages, where they distribute food to such as come for it, and read the *Granth* both of B\u00e1ba N\u00e1nak and of Guru Govind Singh, although they do not attach such importance to the latter. The head of the college is called *mohant*, and the disciples *ch\u00e9las*. They live in Sikh as well as in Hindu villages, and it is probably on this account that they do not quite neglect Guru Govind Singh. They rarely marry; and, if they do so, generally lose all influence, for the *dharm\u00e1s\u00e1la* very soon becomes a private residence, closed to strangers. But in some few families, such as that of Jasp\u00e1l B\u00e1ngar, which keeps a very large *Langar* or alms-house going, it has always been the custom to marry, the endowments being large enough to support the family and maintain the institution; but the eldest son does not in this case succeed as a matter of course. A *ch\u00e9la* is chosen by the *mohant* or by the family. If a *mohant* whose predecessors have not married should do so, he would lose all weight with the people. It has been shown in speaking of the grants for *dharm\u00e1s\u00e1las* and *langars* (page 72) how we have encouraged this class to throw off their religious character by converting them into mere landed proprietors.\n\nThe *Bair\u00e1g\u00eds* (1,889) are to be found in charge of the *th\u00e1kard\u00e9d\u00e1s* or temples of Th\u00e1k\u00e1r, and the *Sain\u00e1s\u00e1s*, who are very few in number, of the *d\u00e9vid\u00e9d\u00e1s* or temples of D\u00e9vi. There are a very few *Nirmil\u00e1s* and *Nihangs* to be found in some villages, where they occupy the *dharm\u00e1s\u00e1las*, and also some *jogi* faqirs. These do not require a detailed account. There are one or two *d\u00e9r\u00e1hs* of *Suthra Sh\u00e1hi* faqirs.\n\nThe *Saiads* have not been included in the religious classes, as they are really agriculturists. The *Bhar\u00e1\u00eds* though Muhammadans, minister chiefly to the Hind\u00fas. There are a few Muhammadan faqirs belonging to the *Madd\u00edri* and *Jald\u00ed* sects mostly.\n\nChief amongst the mercantile class are the *Kh\u00e1tr\u00ed* (15,944). They are to be found mostly in the towns, and engaged in trade of all sorts. The principal *gots* are *Beri*, *Maria*, *Lumb*, *Juidke* in Jagraon; *Th\u00e1par*, *Dhande*, *Adh* in Ludhi\u00e1na. Elsewhere the *gots* are very mixed.\n\nThe *B\u00e1n\u00edas* (8,722) are not numerous, but are to be found everywhere. In the Jangal villages they are the shop-keeping class to the exclusion of all other tribes. They are in religion Jains and Hind\u00fas (*Vaishnavas*), principally the latter. The *Agarwal* *got* predominates.\n\nThe *Sun\u00e1d\u00e1s* (5,962) are found all over the district, and are engaged in their trade of gold and silver-smiths.\n\nThe *S\u00fads* (2,075) deserve mention here, because the Ludhi\u00e1na district is considered the head-quarters of the tribe. It appears from the Census Report that there are less than 20,000 of them in the province, and that more than a quarter of these are in the Kangra district, and more than half in the Jullundur division. These people are distinct from all other Hind\u00fas around; but their origin is a mystery, all explanation by the people themselves having the object of giving a meaning to the name which will reflect...\nhonour on the tribe. They say that they are really the same as the Raiwals of Agra, Delhi, &c., and they have the same gots, but do not intermarry with them. They have become a separate tribe like the Kaiaths, whom they resemble in the laxity of their religious observances, and in their liking for wine and flesh. Geographically they are divided into the hill (Uchandia) and the plain (Neucandia); and socially, into pure (Khara) and inferior (Gola, Chechar). The S\u00fads of the hills are said to belong to the latter class, who have degenerated at some period by widow marriage. The line is now drawn hard and fast; and the two classes do not mix, although the Gola S\u00fads do not now marry widows. The S\u00fads are engaged in money-lending principally, and are to be found in Ludhi\u00e1na and a few villages round and in the town of M\u00e1chiw\u00e1ra. They are fond of service as munshis; and half the patw\u00e1ris of the district and most of the k\u00e1nungos till recently belonged to the tribe. Though of a good physique, they do not like active service. They are most intelligent, especially in their own interests; and there are many sayings in proof of this, e.g., S\u00fad p\u00e1r, ghattri ur\u00e1r (if a S\u00fad is on the other side of the river, leave your bundle on this side).\n\nA better idea of the importance of the various tribes that make up the agricultural community will be got from the following abstract, which shows the proportions in which the land of the district is divided between them:\n\n| Total | Jats | Hindu | Muhamma- | Raip\u00fat (Mu- | G\u00e9jar (Mu- | Arki. | Others |\n|-------|------|-------|----------|-------------|-----------|-------|--------|\n|       |      | Hindu | Muhamma- | hammadan)   | hammadan) |       |        |\n| 100   | 62   | 4     | 10       | 7           | 3         | 14    |\n\nThus the Jats make up more than one-third of the whole population, and own 62 per cent. of the land. They are distributed by religion as follows:\n\n| Total | Hindu | Sikh | Muhammedan |\n|-------|-------|-----|------------|\n| 222,665 | 98,900 | 102,447 | 25,218 |\n\nThe Muhammadan Jats appear to have been converted to Isl\u00e1m in the time of Aurangzeb. They are to be found in the Samrila and the upper part of the Ludhi\u00e1na B\u00e9ts, or just over them. The other Jats are either Sult\u00e1nis (Hind\u00fas) or Gur\u00fa Sikhs (including K\u00fakas). The Jats adhere to their gots or clans through all religions; and their belonging to one faith rather than to another is generally a mere matter of locality. Thus we find of the Garew\u00e1l Got Muhammadan villages in the Samrila B\u00e9t; and in the uplands, Hindu or Sikh. The Muhammadans are perhaps rather bigoted; but with the others religion will be found to have at present a secondary place.\n\nThe Hindu Jat of this district deserves all the good things that have been written of the tribe. If the Jats are the best peasantry in India, we may say that the M\u00e1lwah Jat possesses in a greater\ndegree than any other branch of the tribe the qualities which have earned for it this distinction. In the M\u00e1lwah country is usually included at least the whole of this and the Ferozepore districts, together with the greater part of the Protected Territory to the south of them. In physique the M\u00e1lwah Jat is not surpassed by any race in India, if indeed he is not to be put at the top of the tree in this respect. No Regiment in the Bengal Army can show such fine stalwart soldiers as those recruited from this part of the country; and although detractors are wont to say that he has a small heart in a large person, the Mah\u00e9di has given ample proof that this is mere libel. The M\u00e1lwah Jat appears to surpass his brother of the Manjka in prudence and thrift; and he is a better cultivator, more capable of managing his farm. As evidence of this, we may point to the manner in which the former has succeeded in the struggle going on under our rule between the agricultural and the money-lending class. With the M\u00e1lwah Jat, as a rule, the class whose business is ordinarily money-lending has really very little chance, for the former turns his hand to this as easily as to anything else. When a Jat has spare money, he will not squander it; but, if he gets a chance, will lend it on the security of land. Where Khatris or S\u00fads have established themselves in the early years of rule, it is very hard for the people to shake them off; but in the Dh\u00e1\u00eda villages most mortgages of land are to Jats, some of whom have established a very extensive money-lending business. The Muhammadan Jat, though much superior to the R\u00e1jput or G\u00fajar, is not equal to his Hindu fellow tribesman. He is to be found along the river, principally in the Samr\u00e1la tahsil, and although excelling as a cultivator, he is often reckless and extravagant\u2014a result that may be due either to his religion or to his surroundings, climate, soil, &c.\n\nThere are two types of the Hindu Jat to be found in this district, the difference being entirely the effect of locality. The Jat of the Paw\u00e1dhi, or highly cultivated and irrigated eastern tract, is a slave to his land. With him it has been all work and no play for generations, and this has told on his physique and intellect. The cultivation of his holding is a constant round of toil, especially where there is a large area under sugarcane; and he is lucky if able to knock off and give himself and his cattle a few days' rest during the rains. He has no thoughts beyond his village; and never dreams of service. But withal he is thrifty to niggardliness, and industrious beyond comparison; and it is sheer bad luck if he gets his head under water. When he has a little money to spare, he at once lends it on the security of some less lucky sharers' land. For the Jat of the Jangal the labour of cultivation is of the lightest description, and he appears incapable of remaining idle for long. He turns his hands most readily to carrying: but also goes in largely for cattle trade, service, anything in fact that will enable him to turn an honest penny, for he is seldom a rogue. His favourite method of spending the time between sowing and reaping, when he and his cattle would otherwise be absolutely idle, is to start with a cart in the direction of Ludhiana, sell his own grain, and whatever\nmore he can collect, and return with a load of *gur* or anything else that he thinks he will be able to dispose of at a profit. The cart is probably at first the ordinary rude one used in field work, and the cattle are those that work in the plough; but after a few successful journeys he buys a better cart and probably better cattle, thus extending the field of his operations. This difference of life has produced in him mental and physical qualities, much superior to those of the *Pawddh* Jat, although the latter is far ahead of other tribes in both respects; and one can tell the difference at a glance.\n\nThe Jat of the *Jangal* is undoubtedly at present the finest stamp of peasantry in India. What he will be when irrigation from the Sirhind Canal is fully developed remains to be seen. The *Pawddh* Jat has but one string to his bow, while his brother of the *Jangal* has at present many. Hard cash finds its way into Jagraon and lower Pakhow\u00e1l villages through half-a-dozen channels. Under former rulers, whose system was to take as much from the cultivators as they could get, the Jat was usually kept down; but since annexation his genius has had full play, and he is waxing fat. I do not know of any class that ought to be so grateful to us. On occasion he can be extravagant, and very large sums are sometimes spent on celebrations, especially in Jagraon tahsil. This generally means that a man has more money than he knows what to do with. Besides excelling as an agriculturist, the Hindu Jat is a good subject and a most respectable member of society. He has, as a rule, no vices; and, although I would not assert that a lively sense of gratitude to us as his rulers is ever present in his thoughts, he knows that our Government gives him greater security than any preceding one did, and he is quietly contented. His chief fault is quarrelsomeness, which has now developed into litigiousness.\n\nTo the east of the district, and especially in the Samral\u00e1 tahsil, the multitude of *gots* amongst the Hindu Jats is a very remarkable feature. Not only do adjoining villages belong to different *gots*, but inside each village will generally be found two or three Pattis of distinct origin. This is accounted for by the manner in which the country was colonized. In the history of each village it will be seen that the founders came in comparatively recent times from different parts of the country, and belonged to different *gots*; and that they united merely for their own convenience, the common tie of belonging to the same tribe being sufficient. To the south and west, on the other hand, we do find that the Jats in some instances came in bodies, and villages belonging to the same *got* lie either in groups or within short distances of each other. Thus the *Sidhu* and *Git* Jats appear to have come eastward in large parties, and to have settled down in adjoining or alternate villages in the western part of Jagraon. But the rule throughout the district is variety of *gots*, and the few groups of villages that there are, each belonging to one *got*, are the exception. The reason for this apparently is that in the eastern parts, in the neighbourhood of Sirhind and Ludhi\u00e1na, the Imperial authority was always strong enough to protect its subjects, who settled down in small villages as they came; while in the west it was less felt, and people of one tribe had to collect in large villages...\nfor protection. In Samr\u00e1la no attempt was made at Settlement to return the land as distributed amongst the various subdivisions; but in the other tahsils it was possible to do this roughly, as there were a few gots owning villages and groups of villages. And the details of area held by the leading gots in these two tahsils, as ascertained by the Settlement Officer, are shown below, in percentages of the total area of each tahsil:\n\n| Tahsil | Total Jats | Garewal | Gil | Sidhu | Dhikwal | Dhilan | Sekhon | Bhindher |\n|--------|------------|---------|-----|-------|---------|--------|--------|----------|\n| Ludhiana | 58         | 9       | 3   | 6     | 3       | 1      | 1      | 3        |\n| Jagran | 68         | 1       | 3   | 6     | 3       | 1      | 1      | 3        |\n\nFirst in rank are the Garewal Jats. This got holds about 50 large villages near Ludhi\u00e1na in a group, and members of it are also to be found scattered over the district; but their number is not shown in the Census tables. They trace their descent to a R\u00e1jp\u00fat, R\u00e1ja Rikh, who came from the south and settled in Kahl\u00far in the hills. Bairsi, son of Rikh, left Kahl\u00far and settled at Naieb\u00e1d to the south of Ludhi\u00e1na, and contracted a marriage with a Jatni, called R\u00fapkaur, and had to start a got for himself, as his brothers would have nothing further to do with him. His son was Gare, whence the name of the got; but another fanciful origin is Karew\u00e1l from Kar\u00e9wa. The descendants of Bairsi gradually spread over the country to the south-west of Ludhi\u00e1na. The Garew\u00e1ls are admitted by the other gots to be superior, and are called S\u00e1hu log, i.e., superior. As amongst the R\u00e1jp\u00fats, their women are secluded, and do not take part in field-work. Their girls are sought in marriage by the best families of Sard\u00e1rs, and even by R\u00e1jas. The Garewal families of R\u00e1ipur, Gujarwal and N\u00e1rangw\u00e1l had a sort of local authority at the close of the last century, and are called by pre-eminence S\u00e1hu log. The Garew\u00e1ls are in consequence of all this the proudest of the Jats, and somewhat inferior as cultivators. They are also very extravagant and quarrelsome; but they take to service better than any other got as they hold it honourable, and in all of their villages will be found men who are either serving in our army or in receipt of pensions. A great deal of money thus finds its way into their hands. When they trust to cultivation alone, they are not so successful.\n\nThe Gils own about 40 villages, mostly in Jagraon tahsil, and are returned as 11,899 in number. They are next in rank to the Garew\u00e1ls, and their women are secluded. They are also fond of our service. They here claim descent from S\u00farajbansi R\u00e1jp\u00fats, their ancestor being a king of Gharm\u00e9la in the south, whose son, Akaura, took to agriculture. The son of Akaura, Gil, founded the got which moved northwards by degrees. They came to this district from Kusla in the Jangal il\u00e1qa about 250 to 300 years ago, in the reign of Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n it is said. The Gils are first rate agriculturists; but their habits are generally extravagant.\n\nThe Sidhus have a good many villages in Jagraon tahsil, where there are two or three \"Sidhw\u00e1ns.\" They are a well-known got throughout the Lahore and Amritsar divisions, and much has been written of them. Those of the Ludhi\u00e1na district are of the Bar\u00e1d\nsubdivision; and came from the south-west, from Faridkot it is said, in the time of the Rais within the last 200 to 300 years. The Sidhus number 13,194.\n\nThe Dhaliwalis (12,145) have a good many villages lying about Pakhowal and in the Jagraon tahsil mostly. Their ancestor was, as usual, a Rajput, who came from Jessalmir and settled in Kangar in Nabha territory, becoming a Jat. From Kangar his descendants came into this district under the Rais and their Sikh successors. The Dhaliwalis are accounted one of the superior gots of Jats, but do not differ much in their customs from the others.\n\nThe Bhandhers are the descendants of Bhandher, who was the offspring of the union of a Rajput and a woman of inferior caste. He settled in Bhatinda first, and thence his descendants migrated to Rao Siyan in the Malaudh ilaka, where the tribe now holds 10 or 12 villages.\n\nThe Sekhons had a similar origin to the Bhandhers, and came to this district from some place in Patiala territory, Bhadaur it is said. Their villages are scattered all over the district.\n\nThe Dhillons (6,317) say that they came from the Manjha in the reign of the Emperor Muhammad Shah.\n\nMinor gots of the Jats are\u2014\n\n| Minor subdivisions | ... | ... | ... | 4,964 |\n|-------------------|-----|-----|-----|-------|\n| Gandhu            |     |     |     | 4,296 |\n| Man               |     |     |     | 4,258 |\n| Mangat            |     |     |     | 3,724 |\n| Chima             |     |     |     | 3,008 |\n| Rathi             |     |     |     | 2,930 |\n\nIt would take up too much space to detail the tradition as to the origin of each of these. They are to be found scattered over the district, holding single villages or subdivisions of villages.\n\nThe Rajputs are undoubtedly the oldest of the agricultural tribes that now hold the district. Only 1,600 of them are Hindus, and these inhabit two or three villages in Samrila tahsil. Mr. Walker writes: \"It might perhaps be taken as good evidence of the demoralizing effect of the Muhammadan religion that the Hindu Rajput is very little inferior to the Jat as a cultivator. In the Bet of Samrila the most prosperous village belongs to them, the proprietors being free of debt and largely engaged in trade. The Muhammadan Rajput of this district possesses at least all the bad qualities generally ascribed to his tribe. He has a good physique, but this is about all that can be said in his favour. As a cultivator he is useless, being indolent and apathetic to a degree. He will never do an honest day's work if he can help it, and spends every penny that he can borrow. His village is generally a picture of slovenly cultivation; and he will tell one that this is because it is not his proper business to follow the plough, and because his women are secluded. If possible he will rent his land to some one else, and never fails to try to spend more than his neighbour on a marriage celebration, regardless of the fact that it is certain ruin to him. His women are said to be quite incapable of managing their household affairs, and the Hindu shopkeeper in a Rajput village makes a fortune in a very short time,\nat first, it is said, by cheating the women, and then by getting the men into his books. If a Rajp\u00fat does take to service, it is only in a half-hearted way; and he will on the slightest excuse throw it up and return to his village. In fact the Muhammadan Rajp\u00fat of this district has, as far as I know, no redeeming points in his character, and is a perfectly useless member of society. I may mention that at the Regular Settlement the Muhammadan Rajp\u00fat villages were treated very leniently, and in many cases pay half or one-third less than their neighbours; but this moderation appears to have had no other effect than to encourage further extravagance. The great feature in a Rajp\u00fat's character is, I think, a complete want of anything that could be so designated. He is the most vain and foolish of mortals, and can seldom give a reason for anything that he does. He is, as a matter of course, discontented; but it would require a peculiar state of society to suit him. These remarks apply to the tribe as a whole; but there is a daily increasing number of members of it in whose favour an exception should be made.\" The principal gots or subdivisions of the tribe are the Ghorewadh (4,256) in the east, and the Manj (5,880) in the west (Jagraon tahsil). The Ghorewadh Rajp\u00fats own a great number of villages along the Sutlej in this and the Jullundur district. They trace their descent from Haq\u00e1dh\u00e1, brother of Kachudh\u00e1, who came into the country in the time of Shah\u00e1b-ud-din Ghori (1150 A.D.), and was allowed a grant of as much land as he could ride round in a day, hence the name. Others say he presented a nazar of a horse, and got the tract which his descendants now hold. Half a Rajp\u00fat's time is taken up in listening to absurd stories of this sort over the village pipe, while he ought to be working in his fields. The Manj Rajp\u00fats own a good many villages in Jagraon B\u00e9t and uplands. They come from the south-west, their ancestor Ch\u00e1chu leaving Faridkot and settling at Hat\u00far. From Hat\u00far the descendants of Ch\u00e1chu founded several large villages, Andlu, Halw\u00e1r\u00e1h, &c., in this district, and also crossed the Sutlej. The family of the Rais of Raikot is looked upon as the head of the got on this side of the river. These Rais at one time held a great part of the district under their sway, and a detailed account of the family will be given elsewhere. Other gots of the Rajp\u00fats are Bhatti (2,038), Chauh\u00e1n (1,835), N\u00e1ru (2,020), Janohi, &c.\n\nThe G\u00fajars of this district are unable to give any distinct account of who they are or whence they came, but it appears pretty certain that they are a nomad race (Gan-char=G\u00fajar) who moved from towards the hills in search of pasture, and gradually settled down along the river for the sake of the grazing. They now hold a number of villages in the B\u00e9t or low-lands, mostly in Ludhi\u00e1na tahsil. About 100 years ago Sard\u00e1r Sudha Singh and the K\u00e1kars, who held the B\u00e9t lands under Ludhi\u00e1na, located them in villages; and they have only since then taken to agriculture. The G\u00fajars of this district are all Muhammadans. They are of good physique, tall and well made, but are said to be lacking in courage. Intellectually they are not strong; and they are, as a rule, much too easy going and careless to get on in these times. As cultivators, they are not of the first class, though\nsuperior to the Rajputs. They have a hereditary liking for cattle, especially that of other people; and most of the Gujar villages contain men recognized by the police as criminals. They are as a tribe turbulent, discontented and lawless; and gave a great deal of trouble in the Mutiny. Gujar women help their husbands in the fields. The principal subdivisions are Gors and Chechi, also Kulas and Paseul.\n\nThe Arains of the district appear to have worked their way up the Sutlej from the direction of Mooltan. They are also said to be Kambals converted to Muhammadanism. It is very probable that they did come up the Sutlej, for they can be traced along its banks in the low-lands of Lahore and Ferozepore and half-way up the Ludhiana district; but they are not to be found higher than the town of Ludhiana. They are probably a mixed race, gardeners by profession, who in some locality or other have formed themselves into a separate tribe and spread over the country. The Arains are all Muhammadans. They are generally small, wiry men, capable of a great deal of labour. As cultivators, they rival the Hindu Jats, but are inferior to the latter in intellect. An Arain will support himself and his family on a very minute area of irrigated land, on which no one else could possibly exist; but, as the owner of a large holding, he is less successful than the Jat, and does not seem to have the power of managing a large farm. All the members of his family assist the Arain in his cultivation; and the women sell the vegetables or exchange them for grain. The Arain is a very quiet and inoffensive member of society, and does not appear to trouble himself about politics. The principal subdivisions in this district are Ghalar, Ghalan, Jafali.\n\nThe Awans are said to be a race of foreigners, who came with the first Muhammadan invaders from beyond the Indus. The tribe holds some 10 or 12 large villages round about Ludhiana situated in the low-lands and in the Dhaia. Their number is understated in the Census, some having perhaps been returned as Shekhs. The Awans are all Muhammadans. They are a very fine, powerful race of men, and are inferior only to the Hindu Jats in intellect and enterprise. They are very fair cultivators, but do not depend entirely on agriculture, and are always ready to turn their hands to anything. They are fond of service in the army, police, &c.; and most of their villages can turn out a number of carts which are worked for hire. In the last Kabul war they made a great deal of money by carrying between Jhelum and Peshawar, and some of the villages depend much more on their carts than on their fields. They are an extravagant race, and spend at least as much as they earn. The Awans are very strict Muhammadans, and say their prayers regularly. Very many of them have received a religious education and are Maulvis. Their women are secluded. Their chief fault is quarrelsomeness, which has, as in the case of the Jats, developed under us into a love for litigation.\n\nThere are a few Dogars in the Bet. They resemble the Gujars, being of good physique, but wanting in intellect. As cultivators, they rank with the Gujars, and run them very close as thieves. Their women\nwork in the fields. There are one or two whole Saiad villages; and the tribe holds shares in others scattered over the district. Those of Taraf Saiad\u00e1n, one of the subdivisions of Ludhi\u00e1na, are respectable and well-to-do; but, as a rule, the Saiads are poor cultivators, being much too lazy. There are a few Seinis (304) and Kambohs (951), the latter being Muhammadans; also some Banj\u00e1r\u00e1s (942) and Lob\u00e1nahs (923), all in the B\u00e9t. The last two of these appear to have the same origin (said to be a R\u00e1jp\u00fat one, as a matter of course); but they are now quite distinct. The Banj\u00e1r\u00e1s are a somewhat superior tribe, but it is said that in this district the two tribes intermarry. They are both Hind\u00fas or Sikhs by religion; and, besides agriculture, are engaged in carrying grain, &c., on bullocks; and the Lob\u00e1nahs in making ropes, brushes, &c., from munj. R\u00faecats own one village near Ludhi\u00e1na, and number 1,807. They have certainly nothing in common with R\u00e1jp\u00fats, being the mildest of men, and first-rate agriculturists. The criminal classes of H\u00e1rnis B\u00e9doris, Gaunem\u00e1rs, are also land owners. The H\u00e1rnis were settled down in three or four villages in the east of the district by the Sikh chiefs who overthrew the Rais of Raikot; and the others own each of them a village. It appears that these men have all been returned as R\u00e1jp\u00fats, for so they call themselves. An account of them will be found elsewhere in this volume.\n\nNext in point of numbers to the Jats are the Cham\u00e1rs (59,655), who are returned as nearly one-tenth of the whole population of the district. These people are the most degraded of all classes except the Ch\u00fahras; and their position in the village very nearly approaches to that of servitude. They are known as begdri and are found attached to every village in the district, for the zam\u00ednd\u00e1rs cannot get on without them. They eat the dead cattle, and are considered so unclean that a separate place is assigned for their residence. They are bound to perform certain tasks (begdr) for the zam\u00ednd\u00e1r, and receive certain allowances of grain and all carcasses of cattle. They cannot change their place of abode, for a Cham\u00e1r of one village would not be allowed to settle down in another. Further details as to their dues and services will be found elsewhere (page 100). They are all leather-workers, tanning the skins of the dead animals that are given them, and making buckets for the wells, bhitis' mastaks (water-bags), shoes, &c. They are paid for all new goods supplied, but repairs are included in their task. The Cham\u00e1rs are not recognized as of any religion. They bury their dead.\n\nCh\u00fahras (18,525) are found mostly in the towns and in some villages where they are servants of the higher classes of Jats and of the R\u00e1jp\u00fats, or are village servants (kam\u00edn) for the purpose of summoning people (bul\u00e1ri).\n\nTarkh\u00e1ns or carpenters have taken to agriculture, and own shares in several villages. Those who follow their hereditary occupation are to be found in nearly every village, for they are a necessary element in the agricultural community. The Tarkh\u00e1n, though classed as a village menial (more properly an artizan), is a man of very superior intellect, and occupies a good social position. He can consequently make his own terms with the zam\u00ednd\u00e1r, and moves\nabout as he likes. He does all sorts of carpenter's work, receiving a fixed allowance at harvest time for all repairs and the price of all new work. There is a large colony of Tarkh\u00e1ns working as carpenters in Ludhi\u00e1na. These make carts, all sorts of furniture, boxes, &c.; and some of them have amassed great wealth, which they invest in land when they can. Many of them are also in service; and it is a proof of their good social position that R\u00e1m Singh, the Guru of the K\u00fakas, belongs to the tribe.\n\nThe Loh\u00e1rs are also village servants, who do all the iron-work of the agriculturists, or they are settled down in the larger towns and follow their trade there.\n\nThe Jhinwar is not necessary in most villages, for the Jat women usually fetch the water for domestic use themselves. He is to be found in the towns or in the R\u00e1jput and higher class Jat villages, where the women are secluded. His services are required everywhere in marriage and other celebrations.\n\nThe N\u00e1\u00ed is found everywhere, and is a very important village servant. He is the barber, and is always employed in arranging betrothals, being sent as a l\u00e1gi, or go-between.\n\nThe Jul\u00e1has or weavers are scattered over the villages, where they weave the cotton thread of the zamind\u00e1rs into cloth (woollen blankets are woven by Cham\u00e1rs or Ch\u00fahras who have taken to the profession). There is a large colony of these people in Ludhi\u00e1na.\n\nThe Kumh\u00e1rs (brick-makers), Moch\u00eds (leather-workers), and Chimb\u00e1s (washerman and cloth-stampers) reside mostly in the towns. The agriculturist generally make their own bricks for the wells, but go to the Kumh\u00e1rs for water jars (ch\u00e1tti) and other utensils; and have an agreement by the harvest about these. The Mir\u00e1ds (5,489) are found all over the district, principally in the R\u00e1jput villages. They live by alms.\n\nThe Kal\u00e1ls (1,955) might almost have been classed as agriculturists, for they are all either land-owners or in service, generally both. The Kapurthala Chief held a very large portion of this district under Mah\u00e1raja Ranjit Singh; and this has given the tribe a step in the social scale. They call themselves Aht\u00fandia or Neb, never Kal\u00e1l, and are Sikhs. Some of them hold small j\u00e1girs, and they generally distinguish themselves in service. The Path\u00e1ns (3,629) are mostly confined to Ludhi\u00e1na, the refugees from Kabul; but an ancient colony of them hold the lands of Bahloipur. The Kashmir\u00eds (2,492) are settled in the city of Ludhi\u00e1na.\n\nSECTION E.\u2014VILLAGE COMMUNITIES & TENURES.\n\nTable No. XV shows the number of villages held in the various forms of tenure, as returned in Quinquennial Table XXXIII of the Administration Report for 1878-79. But the accuracy of the figures is more than doubtful. It is in many cases simply impossible to class a village satisfactorily under any one of the ordinarily recognised tenures; the primary division of rights between\nthe main subdivisions of the village following one form, while the interior distribution among the several proprietors of each of these subdivisions follows another form, which itself often varies from one subdivision to another. The following figures show the classification adopted by Mr. Walker at the recent Settlement, while in the paragraphs which follow them will be found his remarks upon the figures:\n\n| Tenure                        | Villages | Shareholders | Acres |\n|-------------------------------|----------|--------------|-------|\n| Zamind\u0101r\u012b held by individuals |          |              |       |\n| Zamind\u0101r\u012b village communities | 22       | 350          | 7,857 |\n| Pattid\u0101r\u012b do.                  |          |              |       |\n| Bh\u0101yach\u0101ra do.                 |          |              |       |\n| Mixed or imperfect pattid\u0101r\u012b or bh\u0101yach\u0101ra | 619 | 58,347 | 812,166 |\n| Government waste               |          |              |       |\n| Other                          |          |              |       |\n| **Total**                      | 901      | 98,705       | 882,167 |\n\n\"These figures show the forms of village tenures in the district according to the accepted definition of the terms zamind\u0101r\u012b, bh\u0101yach\u0101ra and pattid\u0101r\u012b. But little information as to the real constitution of the villages is to be derived from this classification, if indeed it is not distinctly misleading. In the form of statement (see also paras. 103 and 104 of the 'Directions to Settlement Officers,' Barkley's Edition) I read that a bh\u0101yach\u0101ra village is one 'in which possession is the measure of right in all lands,' but I believe that for right we ought to read liability; and that the distinction comes to be a mere question of the manner in which the assessment is distributed for the time being on shares. This makes a very material difference, for in numbers of villages, although the shares have become obsolete to this extent that they are not used for distributing the assessment, the village common land and the receipts from it are still divided according to them. Again, almost every village has got some area, however small, of common land, in the receipts of which the community participate, and this fact makes the tenure 'imperfect.'\n\n\"The purest form of the village community is that in which the proprietors are, or keep up the fiction of being, descended from a common ancestor; and of this type there are only a few villages in the district, belonging mostly to R\u0101jp\u016bts. I have explained (Section D, page 83) the manner in which most of the Jat villages were founded by several families, which generally belonged to different gots or subdivisions. The land was in the first its instance divided according to shares (called hal or plough) a number of these being assigned to each family according to strength. The hal differed according to locality, but was as much as it was estimated that a pair of oxen could plough. Under native rule revenue was realized in kind or by cash on the area of certain crops; but the people retained these customary shares and used them in the distribution of common receipts and in payment of fines, cesses, &c. The subject will be more fully discussed in the second part of this report; but I may state the result generally to be that under our rule, owing to improvements\nin the land, transfers, &c., the shares have been generally abandoned as a measure of liability for Government revenue, but retained as a measure of right in the village common property and of liability for casual demands (e.g., malbah). The native states around (Patiala, Jhind, Nabha and Maler Kotla) have followed our example and substituted a cash demand for revenue taken in kind; but it is everywhere distributed on the shares (haladri). It is only in the Bet and in a very few Dharia villages of this district that the people have of their own free-will adhered to the shares under our rule. There is no village that I know of in which the land was originally occupied piecemeal without a formal division according to shares. The original distribution is generally most elaborate, the whole area having been divided into blocks according to quality, and each sharer getting his portion in each block. Sometimes the land of each subdivision is separate, and there is then this same arrangement amongst the sharers inside of it. I should say, then, that the villages were all pattidari (or zamindari) in their origin; but that in most the shares had fallen out of use for purposes of defining the liabilities of the sharers.\"\n\nThe subdivisions of villages are tarafs in some of the larger villages, pattis in most; and inside of these thulas. The proprietors of a thula are generally of the same got and often the descendants of a common ancestor. Each thula will be found divided into ploughs (hal), which may be either pucka or kachcha, the former representing the original distribution of land, and the latter subsequent partition; but the size of the plough now merely depends on the number of sharers in the subdivision, and it may or may not be the same for the whole village. Thus the land of a village may be divided equally between two pattis, and subdivided inside one into 20 and inside the other into 25 ploughs.\n\nTable No XV shows the number of proprietors or shareholders and the gross area held in propriety under each of the main forms of tenure, and also gives details for large estates and for Government grants and similar tenures. The figures are taken from the Quinquennial Table prepared for the Administration Report of 1878-79. The accuracy of the figures is, however, exceedingly doubtful; indeed, land tenures assume so many and such complex forms in the Punjab that it is impossible to classify them successfully under a few general headings. The tables on the next page give the latest figures as ascertained at the Revised Settlement.\n\nIn most villages there are lands held by persons who are not members of the village community, who possess no share in the common lands, and who are called malikian qabzah. Many of them hold small religious endowments only.\n\nTable No. XVI shows the number of tenancy holdings and the gross area held under each of the main forms of tenancy as they stood in 1878-79, while Table No. XXI gives the current rent-rates of various kinds of land as returned in 1881-82.

The figures collected at the Revised Settlement will be found in the appendices to Mr. Walker's report.\n\nThere are only two or three large samindari estates in the district, and the cultivation is almost entirely by the proprietors themselves. The settlement returns show 21 per cent. of the cultivated area as in the hands of tenants, but the greater part of this is held by men who own other land. The following are the proportions of the various classes of tenants:\n\n| How held | Per cent. of cultivation |\n|----------|-------------------------|\n| With occupancy rights | 5 |\n| At will by proprietors or by tenants who have occupancy rights in other lands | 9 |\n| At will by tenants who have no such rights | 7 |\n| Total | 21 |\n\nWhen a proprietor has any spare land more than he can work, this is either let to a co-sharer who has not enough land of his own to support himself, or an agricultural partnership is entered into.\n\nRents are fixed for the year about June 15th (Nimania), but earlier and separately for cane and cotton. For the Khartf crops (cane, cotton, maize, charri, moth, &c.) a cash rate on the crop is almost invariably fixed by agreement, and paid when the crop is ripe or nearly so, not beforehand. The reason is that if the crop is a bad one a liberal owner will sometimes reduce the rate fixed. The rent is calculated on the local measure, which is the kachcha bigah in the east, and the ghumao or kanal in Jagraon and in most of the Bet. The rent-rate is mentioned, and the amount to be paid is calculated on the known area of the field; or the ground is paced or measured with a rope. The cash rent only covers the harvest, except that sometimes a rate is fixed so as to include the wheat following the maize; but more generally a separate rent in kind is taken for the wheat. The land returns to the owner at once when the crop has been cut. Thus land is rented at the Nimania for charri only; and the crop is taken. The proprietor must arrange for the winter ploughings necessary for the crop of next year, and he disposes of the land at once with this view; but the agreement has really effect from the next Nimania, seven or eight months after, and would be for the Rabi after that. In some villages, where the land is all much of one quality and the cultivation not very good (Muhammadan Rajput villages mostly), the proprietors will rent their land at so much all round on the kachcha bigah. This saves trouble, to escape which is the great object in life of a Muhammadan land-owner. A field is often rented for the cultivation of a single crop like cane, charri, &c.; but, where a number of fields are rented in one holding (lahna), the rent takes the form of this general rate per bigah, or zabti rates are agreed on for certain crops and kind rents for others, the tenant raising the crops that suit him best; or again a lump sum (chakota) is fixed to be paid by the\ntenant as rent of the holding for the whole year, he having liberty to raise what crop he likes. A holding rented in any of these ways will consist of all sorts of land.\n\nRents in kind are taken for the Rabi crops, rarely for cotton, and almost never for other Kharif crops, except in Jagraon tahsil. The straw is divided as well as the grain, and the proprietor takes a somewhat smaller proportion of the former than of the latter. The usual rates are half to two-fifths for unirrigated lands with one-third of the straw; and for irrigated, one-third of grain and one-fourth straw. Bat\u00e1\u00ed, or subdivision of produce, is a very simple process in this district. The tenant cuts and threshes the grain; and on an appointed day the proprietor comes to the heap for his share. The grain is measured out in a large earthenware jar (called ch\u00e1tt\u00ed or mdp) which holds about a kachcha maund (17 seers pucka), and the straw in arm-fulls. The proprietor then removes his share. If a faqir or other holy man appears, he gets a small portion, of which no account is taken. It says much for the intelligence of the people how entirely they have broken away from the very elaborate system of bat\u00e1\u00ed which prevailed forty years ago when the revenue was taken partly in kind. There are none of the elaborate calculations of allowances to the various menials, &c., such as are kept up in less advanced parts of the province; and there are also none of the superstitious observances attending the division of the produce. Perhaps the most important feature of all is the absence of the special weighman of the shop-keeping class. The allowances to menials will presently be described.\n\nThe statistics of rent are contained in Appendices II.A. and B. of the Settlement Report; and from these it will be seen that the proportion of the total area of the land paying proper cash rents is only 5 per cent. of the cultivation, that is after deducting from the areas shown in Appendix II.A. land of which the rent is for various reasons merely nominal. These competition cash rents are shown in Appendix II.B. The former rulers of the country took a large share of their revenue at rates on crops; and this revenue, which was a full rent really, has survived in the cash rates now paid for land taken for the cultivation of cane, maize, cotton and other crops. There are three methods of fixing cash rents. A portion of a proprietary holding may be let for the year at so much on the local standard of area without regard to the crops to be grown; or the area may be approximately known to both parties and a lump sum (called chakota or shak\u00e1wa) be agreed on without actual measurement. In the first case the area is subsequently paced out, and the rent of the whole calculated at the rate agreed on, a third party being called in to settle disputes if necessary. The third method is where a field or area is rented for the purpose of growing a certain crop, and a rent on the crop is charged at a certain rate on the local standard of measure, the area and rent being subsequently determined when the crop is standing. Between ordinary agriculturists, where the transactions are very small, one or other of these three forms of rent is adopted; but where there are large proprietors, such as the Kheri Sard\u00e1rs in Samr\u00e1la tahsil, the old Sikh method of collecting revenue is still\nfollowed, and the tenant agrees to pay at crop rates on whatever he grows in the kharif harvest.\n\nThe rates of rent prevailing throughout the district do not differ very much. Irrigated land will everywhere in the Dh\u00e1ia pay from Rs. 2 to 3 on the kachcha bigah, i.e., from Rs 9-8 to 14 an acre. The rent of unirrigated land of ordinary quality is from Rs. 1 to 1-8 a kachcha bigah (Rs. 4-12 to 7 an acre); but the poorer soils run as low as 12 annas and 8 annas. The proportion of these poorer soils is small, and on the average unirrigated land does not pay less than Re. 1 a kachcha bigah, or nearly Rs. 5 an acre. In the B\u00e9t the first two kinds of cash rent are almost unknown.\n\nThe crops which ordinarily pay zabti or cash rents are cane, maize, cotton, in the irrigated uplands, and the first of these in the unirrigated lands of the Upper B\u00e9t; and in the unirrigated lands of the Dh\u00e1ia the autumn pulses and millets, whether sown for fodder or with a view to grain also. The lowest rate paid for sugarcane land is Rs. 2-8 a kachcha bigah, and this is only in the B\u00e9t. The average in the Dh\u00e1ia is about Rs. 3 or 3-8, while in a few large villages it runs as high as Rs. 5. The general rate is about Rs. 14 or 15 an acre. This rent is for the use of the land during one and a half years usually, as not more than one crop can be got into the two years besides the cane. The rates for maize and cotton are from Rs. 1-8 to 3 a kachcha bigah, and average about Rs. 10 an acre in the Dh\u00e1ia, and something less in the B\u00e9t. For charri and the mixed fodder crops of the kharif Re. 1 a kachcha bigah is usually paid, unless the soil is poor, when the rate is as low as eight annas or twelve annas; but on the other hand it may go as high as Rs. 1-8. The usual rent for rousti land is not much under Rs. 5 an acre.\n\nIn the Bet lands below Ludhi\u00e1na, where there is some very fine market gardening, land will rent as high as Rs. 20 to 30 an acre; but the above rates are those usually paid throughout the district.\n\nThe area returned as paying rents in kind is 10 per cent. of the whole cultivation. The rates prevailing are as follows:\u2014In the B\u00e9t one-half of the grain is taken without a share of the straw; and sometimes two-fifths where the land is irrigated; but even in the case of well lands the proprietor ordinarily realizes at the higher rate. A share of the straw is taken in a few villages. In the Dh\u00e1ia the rate for irrigated lands is one-third of the grain with one-fourth of the straw; and for unirrigated lands one-half of the grain is taken as often as two-fifths, very seldom one-third; while the proprietor's share of the straw varies from one-third to a quarter. In addition to his proper share of the produce, the proprietor takes also a portion under the name of kharch or 'expenses.' In places, too, the proprieter takes from the tenant a portion of the revenue demand as well as a share of the produce.\n\nMr. Walker thus discusses the average size of holdings: \"With the Assessment Reports I submitted statements showing the average size of the proprietary and cultivating holdings, but these, as I pointed out, are quite unreliable. The holdings were of the Khatauni (register of tenancy holdings); and calculations based on them are necessarily valueless. Thus A and B hold land separately, having divided it and also have some in common. A has mortgaged a\ncouple of fields to two other proprietors and B may have done the same. Each of these facts is shown as a separate holding. Or, again, a proprietor cultivates his own land, and has also rented land from another; and he would appear both as a proprietor and as a tenant. I have now done my best to find out what the actual size of the holdings in the different tahsils is. I have taken the total of all land cultivated by proprietors, whether it is their own or that of other proprietors, and divided this by the total number of proprietors whose names appear in the Khewat. Only those are shown as tenants who do not own land. The result is as follows:\n\n| Name of Tahsil | Khewatdars | Occupancy Tenants | Tenants-at-will |\n|----------------|------------|------------------|-----------------|\n|                | No.        | Area cultivated   | No.             | Area cultivated |\n| Samr\u0101la        | 22,617     | 136,300          | 1,059           | 4,160           |\n| Ludhiana       | 51,388     | 331,496          | 3,903           | 11,682          |\n| Jagraon        | 26,608     | 211,509          | 1,855           | 11,352          |\n| Total          | 100,533    | 679,305          | 6,817           | 27,094          |\n\nThus the average area to every cultivating proprietor, who is liable for Government revenue is, for the whole district, six acres. In Jagraon tahsil it is eight acres; and in the Jangal Circle of Ludhi\u0101na, nine or ten. Every khewatd\u0101r is not necessarily the head of a family, for he may be unmarried; but he is in every case an owner of land in his own right.\n\nThe tribal and family customs regulating inheritance, marriage, adoption, and the like, will be found abstracted in great detail in Chapter X of Mr. Walker's Settlement Report.\n\nThe Sutlej forms the northern boundary of the district; and no other river touches it. The custom as between the villages of this and the Hoshiarpur and Jullundur district is: (i) in most of the villages of the Samr\u0101la tahsil and a few of those of Ludhi\u0101na, that of fixed boundaries (called Th\u0101kbastbana or Hadbastbana), by which each village is entitled to have its area made up to the limits of the settlement map (of 1850), whether the land lies on its own or the opposite side of the river; (ii) elsewhere in Ludhi\u0101na and in the Jagraon tahsil the deep stream (Dh\u0101rkal\u0101n) rule prevails with two modifications: (a) land bodily transferred by change in the course of the river (Kukkkgird\u0101na) and susceptible of identification belongs to the original proprietors; (b) where the whole area of a village has gone by diluvion the proprietors are entitled to recover land reappearing on the same side, according to the limits of the Settlement Map. When an island (mand) appears between two villages on opposite sides, if the custom is that of fixed boundaries, each village is entitled to have its area made up according to the map; and if there is anything over, the surplus is divided between the two villages in proportion to their settlement area, otherwise the deep stream rule decides the question of ownership. The deep stream is determined in cases of doubt by calculating roughly the volume of water in the different channels; or, in the last resort, by letting a boat float down the river and seeing which channel it takes.\nAs between two villages on the same side of the river the boundary in newly recovered land is determined by the Settlement map; and when the land is outside of this, either by drawing a straight line from the last boundary pillar to the river, or by producing the line of the last two pillars.\n\nInside villages the customs vary a good deal. In some it is the rule for the co-sharers to make up the annual losses of suffering sharers from village common or from land held in severalty; and in this case new land becomes village common as a matter of course. Elsewhere the custom is that of fixed fields, according to the Settlement map, each proprietor bearing his own losses, and being entitled to land that reappears on the site of his fields, only such area as has been recovered beyond the original limits of the village becoming village common.\n\nAs to occupancy tenants there is no clearly defined rule; but their claim to recover their rights in land reappearing after diluvion is generally recognized (a), when they hold a share of the village, as they generally do; (b), when the rule is that of fixed fields and the proprietor from whom they hold recovers his ownership.\n\nRegarding the appointment of zaid\u00e1rs, the Settlement Officer writes as follows.\n\n\"It was feared that the introduction of the system might interfere with the semblance of local authority, still preserved by some of the larger j\u00e1gird\u00e1rs. The j\u00e1girs of Malaudh and Ladhran were, therefore, excluded from its operation. In the rest of the district the zails were arranged within the tahsils, so far as was possible, according to tribes; although in many places it was found quite impossible to group together villages so as more than partially to secure this object. The B\u00e9t tract is in the hands of a Muhammadan population, belonging to the R\u00e1jp\u00fat, G\u00fajar, Jat, Ari\u00e1n and Aw\u00e1n tribes; but the villages of these are, as a rule, so mixed up that, although it may be said that one or other of the tribes predominates in a certain portion of the lowlands, we could not arrange any single zail so as to consist entirely of villages of the same tribe. Muhammadan Rajp\u00fats and Jats own most of the Samr\u00fala and Upper Ludhi\u00e1na B\u00e9t tracts; while in the lower part of Ludhi\u00e1na and in Jagraon the G\u00fajars are in a great majority. Amongst the Jats of the uplands it was in like manner impossible, except in the case of the Garew\u00e1ls, whose villages are grouped together to the south-west of Ludhi\u00e1na, to arrange the zails by gots.\n\nThe peculiar disadvantages under which the system appears to labour in Ludhi\u00e1na is the weakness of the tribal organization; for I know of no district where want of union amongst the agricultural population is more marked. If villages lie in groups, each belonging to one tribe or got, it is certain that one or two men will be regarded as the heads of the tribe or got; but in Ludhi\u00e1na there is very little tribal feeling anywhere, and almost every single Lambard\u00e1r in each zail was a candidate for the appointment.\n\nThe following is a complete list of zails and zaid\u00e1rs of the district:\u2014\n| Number | Taluk | Name | No. of villages | Land Revenue (with M.M.) | Prevailing tribes (M.=Muhammadan, H.=Hindu.) |\n|--------|-------|------|-----------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| 1      | Sambal | Bahlolpur | 27 | 16,199 | M.

The total of these in\u00e1ms was not to exceed \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) per cent. of the assessment. As far as possible the in\u00e1ms were confined to villages with more than three lambard\u00e1rs. The in\u00e1ms were of three classes\u2014Rs. 20, 25 and 30 per annum, and averaged Rs. 25, which gave two to each zail.\n\nThe total number of lambard\u00e1rs is 2,747, and the average remuneration per annum Rs. 20. Before the time of the Regular Settlement the lambard\u00e1rs were a strong body, well paid and selected as really leading members of the agricultural class; but in the inquiry which was then made their number was more than doubled. Even yet the pay is generally very fair in the Dh\u00e1ia; but in many B\u00e9t villages lambard\u00e1rs receive as little as Rs. 2 to 3 a year, and there is often very little to distinguish than from the rest of the proprietary body. Not one in a hundred keeps a horse or pony; and their sole idea of duty to Government is that they must realise the revenue and their own allowance. In fact till recently the first of these duties was relegated to the patw\u00e1ri, who regularly accompanied the lambard\u00e1rs when taking the money to the tahsil, in case that it might be misappropriated. It is, perhaps, a sign of progress that the authority of the lambard\u00e1rs, such as it was, is daily diminishing; but a further weakening is likely to lead to much administrative inconvenience. In many villages the sharers, though perfectly able to pay their revenue, neglect to do so, well knowing that the lambard\u00e1r will get into trouble, and the latter has at best a very clumsy remedy against defaulters.\n\nThe kharpanch deserves mention as a growth of our system. He is a sharer who has acquired a reputation for cleverness and for knowing law; and has probably sharpened his wits by hanging about our Courts. He is invariably in opposition to the lambard\u00e1rs and to Government; but his advice is taken on all matters by individuals or by the whole community. Any one wishing to institute a case consults him; and he is always ready to suggest to a sharer some cause of quarrel with his neighbour. The kharpanch is in fact the village mischief-maker, and everybody's business is his.\n\nThe tol\u00e1h or modi corresponds to the dharv\u00e1di of the M\u00e1njha country. Under Sikh rule, and until very recently, he was the patw\u00e1ri in addition to his other numerous vocations. Besides his private business of shop-keeper, he managed the malbah or village fund, and made out what were accepted as partw\u00e1ri's annual papers for Government.\n\nIn the following paragraphs will be found some account of the village artizans and menials (kam\u00edns), and the allowances made to them. Under former rulers when the revenue was realized in kind a small portion of the whole produce was first set apart for the kam\u00edns and for some servants of the chief, and the remainder was divided between the cultivator and the Sark\u00e1r in the proportion fixed. With a cash demand this custom disappeared, and the kam\u00edns now receive their allowances from the cultivating\nproprietors in a lump at each harvest. There is none of the elaborate division of the produce such as is customary in other districts; and, even when a tenant pays his rent in kind, no deduction is made from the common heap; but each party gives his kamins from his own house a fixed amount of produce and not a share of the whole. The tendency is for the cultivators to alter their agreements with the kamins, and to cut the allowances down. In fact these allowances are generally ceasing to be determined by custom. The calculations made by the Settlement Officer gave the result, that of the whole produce from one-twentieth to one-sixteenth was given to the kamins, and the deduction that should be made on this account from the total produce was fixed at $7\\frac{1}{2}$ per cent. It may be open to doubt whether any deduction at all was necessary, for a tenant paying in kind has to give to his kamins a portion of the share left him by the proprietor; but it was not considered advisable to depart here again from the usual procedure. In places proprietors have taken advantage of the old custom and realize a proportion (1 or 2 seers in the maund) of the total produce under the name of kharch over and above the share of the produce agreed on; but this, though nominally for servants and kamins, is really only an addition to the proprietor's share.\n\nThe most numerous of the village menial class are the Cham\u00e1rs, of whom some account has been given in Section D (page 88). These people have to perform certain tasks, of which the principal is the repair of all leather appliances (well buckets, seed-drills, &c.) and of the cultivators' shoes; and they have also to repair the village gates, to collect grass and keep watch when any officer of Government comes, to carry bundles to the next village on such occasions, &c., &c. They have also to remove all dead cattle, and they are entitled to the carcases and skins of these. The Cham\u00e1rs are paid full price for all new goods, shoes, buckets, &c.; and occasionally cultivate a piece of land, either alone or in partnership with a zamind\u00e1r. They generally receive as menials an allowance of grain per plough (about 30 seers); also some cotton and gur. These allowances are also, though rarely, made on the total yield (about one seer per maund). The Cham\u00e1r families are generally divided amongst the sharers, say one to every ten houses of the latter.\n\nThe Takh\u00e1n or carpenter in return for an allowance at harvest time has to execute all repairs, and also to make small things, like goads, yokes, &c., but for new ploughs, pitchforks and other implements of the sort he is paid in cash, the cultivator supplying the wood. He has a good deal of work about the wells, and a great deal at the presses being in villages where sugarcane is grown.\n\nThe Loh\u00e1r or blacksmith makes the plough-share, the cultivator supplying the iron, and he also repairs all iron-work. Sometimes one man does the work of carpenter and blacksmith. The Takh\u00e1n and Loh\u00e1r receive allowances either on the plough or on the total produce (from a quarter seer to one seer per maund).\n\nWhere there are Ch\u00e1hras they are only used for calling the people together or giving notice to any one who is wanted bul\u00e9ri. The allowance is small, generally one-sixteenth to a quarter seer in the maund.\nThe Jhinwar, or waterman, has to supply baskets for the cane press, and gets a very small allowance (about one-sixteenth to one-eighth seer per maund). He also supplies water at marriages, but is paid for this specially.\n\nThe Nai or barber performs personal services to the cultivator, cuts his nails, shaves him, &c., &c., and receives much the same as the Jhinwar.\n\nThe plough (hal) on which these allowances are generally calculated is a variable measure; but, roughly speaking, where all the kamins receive a full allowance, they absorb one-twentieth to one-sixteenth of the gross produce. This is according to the administration papers of the villages; but the practice is really different. Under the Sikhs, when the revenue was taken in kind by the servants of the ruler, a heap was set apart for the village servants (two to two-and-a-half seers in the maund); and this was divided amongst them according to their recognized shares. But with our fixed assessment this system could not continue, except where a proprietor takes rent in kind from a tenant. There has been a tendency to break up the constitution of the village in regard to these menials, the action being mostly on the part of the proprietors, for the kamins are generally much too degraded to wish for any change, and are in the power of the proprietors completely, not having even the option of changing their abode when too hard pressed. The result has been that the proprietors attempt to cut down the allowances, and make new terms with the kamins. In many administration papers a condition has been recorded that the relation of the proprietors to the kamins is liable to annual revision, and in some villages there are no customary allowances or services at all; and, when a cultivator has any work to be done by one of the class, he pays for it in grain or cash. In many villages too the proprietor will not now allow the Cham\u00e1r to have the skins, as the price of leather has risen very high in late years, and money is to be made out of them.\n\nThe subject of the employment of field labour other than that of the proprietors or tenants themselves, is thus noticed in answers furnished by the District Officer and inserted in the Famine Report of 1879 (page 714):\n\n\"The field labourers are never exactly hired. They are paid by a share of the produce, usually one-fourth, and they are employed by the season. They are generally of the menial classes\u2014sweepers, cham\u00e1rs, weavers, blacksmiths, carpenters, &c. When they cannot get field-work, they exercise their handicrafts. They were in the 1868 Census 10 per cent. of the non-cultivating population. In the isolated instances in which men are hired by the month, they are paid Rs. 3 per month. Their condition is distinctly inferior to that of the self-cultivating poorer agriculturists. They usually get an advance from the zam\u00ednd\u00e1rs, which is deducted in grain at the harvests. They get petty loans from the village bani\u00e1s, but as they have not the security of the land to offer, the bani\u00e1s do not trust them with much.\"\n\nA b\u00fatia k\u00e1ma is a farm labourer kept by a proprietor, generally because the latter cannot for some reason work his\nplough himself. The *btia k\u00e1ma* gets Re. 1 to Re. 1-8 a month, and his food and clothes from the proprietor; but has no interest in the produce.\n\nThe wages of labour prevailing at different periods are shown in Table No. XXVII, though the figures refer to the labour market of towns rather than to that of villages.\n\nIf a proprietor does not care to rent his land, he will enter into a partnership with some cultivator (called a *s\u00e1njhi*). The *s\u00e1njhi* may contribute only his labour, in which case he is called *ji-de-s\u00e1njhi*; or he may also contribute cattle, when he is called *s\u00e1njhi* simply. The share of produce that the *s\u00e1njhi* receives would depend on what he contributes, each man and each beast counting as a unit in the calculation. Thus a proprietor may have three bullocks and the *s\u00e1njhi* one; and they would together make up two ploughs in unirrigated lands. The *s\u00e1njhi* would in this case get two out of six shares in the produce or one-third; and the proprietor would probably pay the revenue and supply the seed, &c.; but this is a matter of agreement, and the terms vary a good deal. Sometimes several proprietors club together for the better working of their well land, jointly irrigating the fields of each in turn.\n\nThe last two lines of Table No. XVI show the number of persons holding service grants from the village, and the area so held. But the figures refer only to land held free of revenue, which is by no means the only form which these grants assume. Sometimes the land is leased to the grantee at a favourable rent, or on condition of payment of revenue only; sometimes the owner cultivates and pays the revenue, making over the produce to the grantee; while occasionally the grant consists of the rights of property in the land, which, subject to the usual incidents, such as responsibility for revenue and the like, vest in the person performing certain specified services at such time and for so long as he performs them. These grants are most commonly made to village menials and watchmen on condition of or in payment for services rendered, to attendants at temples, mosques, shrines, or village rest-houses so long as they perform the duties of the post, and for maintenance of monasteries, holy men, teachers at religious schools, and the like.\n\nIn every village there is a common fund (*m\u00e1lbah*) managed by the lambard\u00e1s. There were formerly various sources from which money came into this:\n\n1. Receipts from sale of produce of the common land, and rents paid for cultivation of it.\n\n2. *Atr\u00e1\u00f1*, or a cess levied on the houses of the artizans and sometimes of the shop-keepers, at the rate generally of Re. 1 per annum on each shop or house.\n\n3. *Dharat* or *tul\u00e1\u00f1*. Whenever grain was sold in the village it was weighed by the *tolah*, who charged at a certain rate on each transaction, and credited a portion of these receipts to the village fund.\n\n4. There has always been a good deal of expenditure from the common fund, principally on feeding faqirs and other holy men; and, as this generally exceeds the receipts, a collection has to be made from the sharers. The second and third sources of income have\nsurvived in only a few villages; and with the spread of cultivation the first does not remain in many. In the eastern villages the funds are invariably raised in the following way. The lambardars have the power of incurring expenditure as necessary, getting the money from some appointed shop, and the account is made up once or twice a year, the sharers being entitled to have it explained to them. The amount spent is then collected by a b\u0101ch or contribution from the sharers. In some villages the proprietors have allowed the lambardars to realize a small percentage on the land revenue for this purpose, and the latter are then responsible for the whole expenditure. In a few villages to the west (Jagraon and Pakhowal) atv\u0101f\u012b is still realized; but the proprietors generally prefer to divide the receipts, keeping the public account separate in the manner described above. When considerable sums are now and again realized by the sale of wood on the common land, this same course is followed. In the Jangal villages, the whole village expenses are paid by dharat, or fees on sales of grain, the transactions in those parts being much more considerable than in the eastern villages. Disputes about the village fund are constant, and the endeavour is everywhere to deprive the lambardars of the power to spend money for any purpose. The sharers are usually put up by some knowing one to question this right, and the management of the common fund becomes a standing cause of quarrel.\n\nTable No. XXXII gives statistics of sales and mortgages of land; Tables Nos. XXXIII and XXXIIIA show the operations of the Registration Department; and Table No. XXXIX the extent of civil litigation. But the statistics of transfers of land are exceedingly imperfect; the prices quoted are very generally fictitious; and any figures which we possess afford but little real indication of the economical position of the landholders of the district. The subject is discussed at some length at pages 422 ff. of the Famine Report of 1879, where actual figures are given for instances selected as typical. In forwarding these figures, the Settlement Officer wrote as follows.\n\n\"The district has a river frontage on the Sutlej of about 60 miles, and stretches to the south of it some 20 or 30. The alluvial tract between the river and high land is more extensive than in most districts, reaching inland 5 or 6 miles. It is inhabited by Muhammadans of the Rajp\u00fat and Gujar tribes, who form about one-sixth of the agricultural population of the whole district. The upland tract is almost entirely in the hands of Jats, principally Hind\u00fas, who form about two-thirds of the whole agricultural population of the district. The difference in the condition of the inhabitants of these two tracts is so very marked that it will be better to give a separate account of each.\n\n\"The B\u0113t or alluvial tract has a most fertile soil, requiring very little exertion from man for its cultivation. If the overflow from the river fail, the Kharif harvest may be bad; but it is not probable that there will be a failure of rain in the same year, and a good Rabi crop makes up the deficiency. The water is so near the surface that it can be raised with little exertion in any amount for irrigation. What\nthe people dread is excess of flood from the river rather than drought. Notwithstanding these advantages, the Rajputs and Gujars who own and cultivate the land are in a very bad condition. Naturally indolent and thriftless, they are the worst cultivators and the most reckless spenders of any money that comes into their hands. They have no idea of regulating their expenditure by their means, and are consequently in the power of the money-lenders, who are too willing to make advances on the security of the land. I believe that all the owners in this tract are in debt, and most of them deeply. They have no property except the jewelry of their women and a few cattle. Their houses are squalid; they have none but earthenware dishes, seldom any store of grain; and they are generally dependent for their daily food on their money-lenders, whose terms preclude the chance of any part of the produce remaining in their hands. The only cause of their indebtedness, I may add, is their thriftlessness. Special allowance was made for their habits in fixing the Government assessment, which is comparatively light.\n\n\"These remarks apply to the owners of the land. The condition of the tenants is for several reasons much superior. Rent is generally paid in kind, so that the distinction between tenants-at-will and occupancy tenants is not marked. Of late years, owing to the influx of grain principally, there has been a great demand for labour in and about the town of Ludhiana; and men have been drawn away largely from cultivation. A tenant can earn three to eight annas a day by manual labour, and thus add largely to his means of subsistence. The Rajput proprietors, who are themselves much above working as coolies, are really at the mercy of their tenants. I have heard of many cases in which a tenant with occupancy rights, holding of a Rajput proprietor, cultivates a small portion only of his land; the proprietor receiving as his share of the produce what is worth actually less than the Government assessment of the holding.\n\n\"I can give no reliable figures as to the amount of indebtedness of the various classes at this stage of the Settlement. All of the proprietors in the Bet are probably in debt, most of them deeply, and very few of the tenants.\n\n\"Turning to the Dhaia or upland tract of the district, we see a very different picture. The country stretches to the south, a clear and fertile plain unbroken by a single stream. The soil is light and capable of yielding the richest staples. In the eastern part of the district the water is near the surface, and a large proportion of the land is irrigated; while towards the west the soil becomes lighter and more mixed with sand, and irrigation rarer. But the people (Jats) are much the same everywhere. They make the best use of the land that their knowledge admits of, and are most frugal in their mode of life, eating whatever grain is in season, and spending little money in extravagance. The people are almost entirely cultivating owners. The tenants that there are consist principally of (1) owners cultivating the land of other owners; (2) village menials.\n\n\"In the small populous portion of the district adjoining Umballa the land is mostly irrigated, and the conditions are a little different. But in the greater portion, roughly speaking all to the south and west of the railway, the proportion of land irrigated is small. The soil,\nthough light and sandy, is most fertile; and in a good year the supply of grain from a holding is much more than sufficient for the support of the household. The surplus is either stored or sold, and the proceeds laid away or lent. If there is a scanty rainfall, the people are not at a loss. What generally happens is this. There is no fodder for the cattle (as there is no land left for grazing in the whole district), and the cows and buffaloes are sold for almost nothing, or die. The men of the family leave the other members to subsist as they can on the store of grain or money hoarded, and go to seek work elsewhere. Few zamindars' houses in the district are without a cart; and the men, yoking their bullocks, not now required for agriculture, into this, go off to Lahore, Peshawar and Delhi, conveying goods for hire. In a few months they return with earnings sufficient to live over the bad harvest.\n\n\"The seasons have been particularly good recently, and the high price of grain has brought a good deal of money into the agriculturists' hands. Some of them speak of being in debt; but there are very few indeed who owe more than a couple of good harvests will pay off. The debts they refer to are temporary, and the creditor is generally a brother proprietor. In very few villages is there a professional money-lender. The houses testify by their outward appearance to the prosperity of the people. Brass dishes are always to be found in them, and there is generally a store of grain and some money hoarded. The women all wear silver jewelry. Most houses have two or three cows or buffalo cows, and something is made by selling the young stock or the ghi.\n\n\"The custom in this tract is for a tenant, invariably in the case of occupancy tenants, and usually in the case of tenants-at-will, to pay a consolidated rent, that is, the Government demand and something over. This system does not appear to work so well for the tenants, who are not generally men of sufficient means to bear the burden of a bad year; and debt is not uncommon amongst them.\n\n\"In conclusion, I should say that the condition of the agricultural population was most flourishing, except in the lands along the river. The owners in that tract are mostly indebted, many whole villages being mortgaged. Among the Jat owners the amount of debt is very small. I regret that I can give no figures at present as to the amount of indebtedness. Occupancy tenants hold less than 5 per cent. of the whole cultivation. They are well off in the low-lands, and not so prosperous in the higher lands. On the whole I should not say that they were generally in debt. Tenants-at-will hold about 20 per cent. of the cultivated land; but a large proportion of these have also land of their own, or are village servants, having other means of eking out a livelihood. Tenants depending entirely for support on their holdings do not form a great part of the agricultural community. This class is, as a rule, free from debt.\"\n\nSECTION F.\u2014LEADING FAMILIES.\n\nAt pages 253 to 272 of Griffin's Punjab Rajas will be found an account of the Bhadaur Chiefship, and of the manner in which the Phulki\u00e1n families Bhadaur Chief.\nPatiala claims over it were rejected on their merits in 1855. The estate was a portion of this and of the Ferozepore districts, the Ludhiana villages being in the Pakhowal tahsil, till the year 1858, when the whole jagir was transferred to Patiala, the supremacy being allowed by favour of the British Government and not by right. It is not necessary under these circumstances to do more than mention the family. Sardar Atar Singh resides principally at Ludhiana, where he has built a magnificent house, and has opened a public library. His services in the cause of learning are too well known to require to be noticed here; and he has acquired a great amount of local influence.\n\nThe leading family of the district is that of Malaudh, a branch of the Phulkian stock, of whom mention will also be found at pages 273\u2014276 of the \"Rajas.\" It may be well to repeat the pedigree here, bringing it up to date:\n\n```\nPHUL.\n|     |\n|     |\nRama. | Bakhta.\n|     |\nM\u00e1n Singh.\n```\n\n```\nDalel Singh. | Bh\u00e1g Singh.\n|             |\nFattah Singh. | Suj\u00e1n Singh. | Mit Singh. | Ranjit Singh. | Hak\u00edkat Singh.\n| (O.

Bakhta settled a few miles east of Bhadaur in the village of Dhapali, where he had connections, till he was called in by a Jat of the name of Sahna, who had attempted to found the village which still bears his name, but was pressed by the neighbouring villages. Bakhta built a rude fort which was called Kot Bakhta, and made this his head-quarters; but the name of Sahna has stuck to the village, which still has a large fort belonging to the family. M\u00e1n Singh, the son of Bakhta, conquered the Malaudh il\u00e1ga from the M\u00e1ler Kotla Afghans about the year 1750 A.D. This was the period of activity of the Cis-Sutlej Sikhs against the Muhammadans, which culminated in the fall of Sirhind in 1863. M\u00e1n Singh died leaving an extensive estate to his two sons, Dalel Singh and Bh\u00e1g Singh, who quarrelled about the division of this. The dispute was referred to Sardar Ch\u00fahar Singh of Bhadaur; and the decision then given has established the rule of succession in the family. The elder son got two-thirds,\nand the younger, one-third; and it is according to these proportions that all subsequent distributions of the jagir have been made within the various branches. There have never as yet been more than two sons to succeed in any branch. The Malaudh family maintained a position of independence, the relationship to the Patiala Rajas giving it immunity from the attacks of its neighbours. It came under our protection with the other Cis-Sutlej Chiefs at the beginning of the century. When the Ludhiana district was formed out of the territories annexed in 1846, the Malaudh estates were included in it; but the jagir was maintained in its entirety as the family had not been compromised in the struggle of 1845. The jagirdars were allowed to continue collections from the cultivators till 1850, when a cash assessment was fixed for the villages of the jagir. The family, like all other Cis-Sutlej chiefs, except the six treated as independent, was deprived of all powers; and its local influence may be said to have almost ceased, for the Jats, who make up the population of the villages, have little respect for anyone who cannot display authority over them. In 1860 the representatives of the three main branches were invested with magisterial powers, to be exercised within the local limits of their jagirs; and this measure has done much to resuscitate the influence of the family, and has placed it in a much better position with regard to the people, who up to 1846 were as much its subjects as the villages of the Patiala State now are of the Maharaja. The value of the jagir, as recently assessed, is Rs. 85,077, and it is thus distributed between the four members of the family:\n\n| No. | Name            | Value   |\n|-----|-----------------|---------|\n| (1) | Sardar Utam Singh | 43,136  |\n| (2) | Do. Badan Singh  | 15,783  |\n| (3) | Do. Sundar Singh | 7,793   |\n| (4) | Do. Balwant Singh | 18,867  |\n\nThe family, besides enjoying these revenues, also owns a good deal of bir, or land reserved by the chief for grazing, firewood, hunting, &c., as well as all holdings of such proprietors as absconded on the introduction of a cash assessment or subsequently. Some of the birs are of considerable extent, and are still covered with a growth of wood. The villages of the jagir were distributed between the other Sardars before annexation; and in 1878 between Sardar Badan Singh and Sardar Sundar Singh.\n\n(1). Sardar Utam Singh, the head of the family, lives in Ramgarh (near Malaudh), where there is a large fort built by his father, Sardar Fateh Singh. He has also the fine old fort at Sahna, built by Chaudhri Bakhta; but this he seldom visits. Sardar Utam Singh has the powers of a magistrate of the second class, and civil powers in cases up to Rs. 300 value.\n\n(2 & 3). Sardar Mit Singh had two forts, a very large one at Malaudh and a smaller one at Pakhoke. The former was assigned to Sardar Badan Singh, who resides in it, and exercises the same criminal and civil powers over the whole estate belonging to his branch as Sardar Badan Singh does in his share. Sardar Mit Singh lent his best assistance in the Mutiny, supplying horsemen and footmen to the extent of his ability. For this he was rewarded by the perpetual remission of half of his commutation money; and, while\nthe other branches pay two annas in the rupee of their revenue, his descendants have to pay only one anna. Sardar Sundar Singh resides at Pakhoke.\n\n(4). Sardar Hakikat Singh died in 1875, and the estate has since been under the management of the Court of Wards, his son, Sardar Balwant Singh, being at the Wards School, Umballa, a young gentleman of 16 or 17 years.\n\nThe next jagir in importance to Malaudh is that of Ladhran. The ancestor of this family, Jai Singh, was a Gurum Jat of Karanke Dhirke near Atari in the Amritsar district. He was a member of the Nishanawala confederacy; and in the scramble for territory which followed the capture of Sirhind in 1763 A.D. secured a piece of territory lying between Ludhiaina and Samrala with 27 villages, and seven others in the Kharar tahsil of Umballa. Jai Singh gave his brother, Nahar Singh, one of the former villages, Palmazra, which the descendants of the latter still hold. Jai Singh had two sons, Chart Singh and Kharak Singh, the latter of whom was a noted robber, and was allowed by his brother one village, Ranwan, which still belongs to his descendants. The rest of the territory went to Chart Singh, who in A.D. 1809, accepted British protection. There was a dispute with Patiala as to the Kharar villages, which ended in the Ladhran family getting four out of seven. The territory in Ludhiaina was small; and the relations between the family and the Nabha State appear to have been rather doubtful. At pages 392-394 of the Punjab Rajas will be found an account of the claim to supremacy set up by Nabha, and the decision of the Government of India on it. Although the Ladhran Sardars, like others of the Nishanawala group, were at times in actual opposition to Nabha, there can be no doubt that they gradually became to some extent dependent on that State. After the campaign of 1845-46 the Ladhran territory passed into our hands, and was included in the Ludhiaina district, the jagir being maintained to the family. The descendants of Chart Singh are very numerous; and the jagir, which is worth Rs. 24,000 in all, is becoming more and more subdivided. One or two of the family have taken to service, Sardars Hari Singh and Abel Singh being Rissaldars in the 12th and 13th Bengal Cavalry respectively; but most of them prefer to eat the bread of idleness. It is likely that in another generation or two the shares held by many members of the family will be insufficient for their maintenance. The pedigree of Chart Singh's descendants now alive is as follows:\n\n**CHART SINGH**\n\n```\nUtam Singh.          Vazir Singh.          Ram Singh.          Raja Singh.\nBangat Singh.        Abel Singh.           Harman Singh.       Buda Singh.\nHari Singh.          Mahtab Singh.        Sahib Singh.         Kishan Sham Singh.\nNadhan Singh.        Chatar Singh.        Sher Singh.          Shamsher Singh.\n```\n\nThe rule of succession is chundavand, i.e., the estate is partitioned according to the number of wives of the deceased, the\nchildren of each wife dividing a share between them equally. Maht\u00e1b Singh, Sh\u00e1m Singh and Nadh\u00e1n Singh have still very fair incomes. The family also own landed property, one whole village and shares in several more, and some very fine houses at Ladhran, where they all reside.\n\nOther existing j\u00e1girs in the Samr\u00e1la tahsil are: first, Kotla Badla. The founder of this family was Rai Singh, who came from the Amritsar district in Sambat 1916; and on the fall of Sirhind secured four villages, Badla, Kotla Badla, Bhari and Saidpur. The family, like others in this tahsil, maintained their independence in the midst of their more powerful neighbours; but it is probable that all of them would eventually have been absorbed by the Phulkian Chiefs or by Lahore but for our interference. The villages came to us when the rest of the country was annexed in 1846. The pedigree of the family is as follows:\n\n**RAM SINGH.**\n\n```\nKor Singh    Gurbakhsh Singh.\n            Ratan Singh,\n            Gurmukh Singh.   Sarmukh Singh.\n            L\u00e1l Singh     Narain Singh. and two others.\n            Harn\u00e1m Singh.\n```\n\nThe descendants of Kor Singh and Gurbakhsh Singh hold Badla and Kotla Badla; but they are too numerous to mention. The other branch is much better off; and L\u00e1l Singh is a man of some means, and has a good deal of influence. The whole j\u00e1gir is only worth Rs. 7,611 per annum.\n\nThe founders of the Jabu Mazra family were Rai Singh and R\u00e1m Singh, Jats (got Kang), from Amritsar. About A.D. 1863 they secured 16 villages to the south-west of Khanna; but were exposed to constant attacks from Patiala and the Kap\u00farthala Chiefs, who finally annexed and divided the whole estate. The Sard\u00e1rs complained to the Resident at Umballa, and eight villages were restored to the family. These they now hold with a revenue of Rs. 10,722. The pedigree is\u2014\n\n**RAI SINGH.**\n\n```\nCh\u00e9t Singh.    R\u00e1m Singh.\nUtam Singh.\nDa\u00eda Singh.    Sher Singh.    Lahna Singh.    Gurbakhsh Singh.    Gardit Singh.\nGanda Singh.    Bishan Singh    Fat\u00edah Singh    Sampuran Singh    Chuh\u00e1r Singh.\nand two others. and two others. and four others.\n```\n\nThere are two branches\u2014one (R\u00e1m Singh's) residing at Jabu Mazra; and the other (Ch\u00e9t Singh's) at Dh\u00edru Mazra. There is little to distinguish these men from the Jats around them, except their extravagance, and not one of them is in service. Ganda Singh and Chuh\u00e1r Singh are the heads of the families at present.\n\nThe Kotla Ajner family have a j\u00e1gir of four villages acquired by the ancestor of the present holders, a M\u00e1njha Jat, subject to the Ahluw\u00e1li Chief. The lands came to us by annexation with the\nother Kap\u00farthala territory in 1846; and the j\u00e1g\u00edr was confirmed to the family, half to be held in perpetuity. The revenue is Rs. 4,132, of which the members of the family now receive half. The pedigree is\u2014\n\nThis family is of no importance at all; and none of the members are in service. Other j\u00e1g\u00edrs of less note are:\u2014\n\nNish\u00e1nw\u00e1l\u00e1; holding four villages in shares with Government (Rap\u00e1l\u00f3n, &c.). The revenue of the j\u00e1g\u00edrd\u00e1rs is Rs. 2,343, which is divided amongst six or seven families.\n\nSonti\u00fa\u00e9d\u00e1; holding three villages in shares with Government, and having an income of Rs. 5,231.\n\nShampur; two villages with income to the j\u00e1g\u00edrd\u00e1rs of Rs. 2,587.\n\nS\u00e1ldoudi; one village (shared) with an income to j\u00e1g\u00edrd\u00e1rs of Rs. 1,703.\n\nThese are four communities of j\u00e1g\u00edrd\u00e1rs, descendants of old Sikh confederacies. The Bh\u00e1i of B\u00e1gr\u00edan and the Dhin Mul\u00e1n\u00e1h (Umballa) Sard\u00e1rs have each a village in j\u00e1g\u00edr.\n\nMention has been made in Chapter II of the various minor chiefs who held the tahs\u00edl at the time of annexation. Such of these as were driven across the Sutlej and have no further interest for us here need not be noticed; but there are one or two whose families have since become extinct, or who, though losing their possessions after the Sutlej campaign, maintained their local connection. The Sodh\u00eds of M\u00e1chiw\u00e1r\u00e1 held two or three villages in the neighbourhood of that town, and a masonry fort in it; but the j\u00e1g\u00edr was confiscated for their conduct in 1845. A representative of the family still resides in M\u00e1chiw\u00e1r\u00e1 and owns a little land; but has no position.\n\nThere were a good many branches of the K\u00e1k\u00e1r family, which came from the Jullundur Do\u00e1b. One branch took possession of several villages about Bahlolpur; but was spoiled by Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja Ranjit Singh, who, however, restored some of their possessions in j\u00e1g\u00edr. For the conduct of the family in the war of 1845 the greater part of the j\u00e1g\u00edr was confiscated, and the rest lapsed by escheat shortly after. The only legitimate survivor at present is a female, who holds the family fort at Kakr\u00e1l\u00e1.\n\nThere was a large j\u00e1g\u00edr held at the time of annexation by Sard\u00e1rn\u00ed Dai\u00e1n Kaur of Khanna, the daughter of Dasaundha Singh, a M\u00e1njha Jat, who had established himself at the same time as the other j\u00e1g\u00edrd\u00e1rs from across the Sutlej. He was the servant of T\u00e1r\u00e1 Singh Ghaiba referred to in Chap. II. Dai\u00e1n Kaur was the widow of a son of the R\u00e1ja of Jind; and was continued by us in the possession of the j\u00e1g\u00edr of her father's villages till her death without issue in 1850, when the j\u00e1g\u00edr lapsed. She had\na large fort at Khanna. The j\u00e1g\u00edr consisted of seventeen villages with a jama of Rs. 30,217.\n\nThe ancestor of the Kheri Sard\u00e1rs, Nand Singh, was a Jat who came from the M\u00e1njha to assist in the capture of Sirhind; and afterwards established his power over a very fertile piece of country in the south-east corner of the tahsil. This was then only partly settled by Muhammadans and others, many of whom deserted their lands; and to Nand Singh is due the founding of most of the villages of the Kheri il\u00e1qa, which is now the richest and most highly assessed portion of the district. The family maintained an independent position till they were absorbed by us in 1846. The j\u00e1g\u00edr was continued to Sard\u00e1r Basant Singh, who was succeeded by his son Hari Singh. The latter died without issue in 1866 and the j\u00e1g\u00edr then lapsed. Sard\u00e1rn\u00ed Nih\u00e1l Kaur, widow of Hari Singh, and two other female relatives, Ratan Kaur and Sahib Kaur, enjoy considerable cash pensions, and Nih\u00e1l Kaur has a life interest in the estate of Hari Singh which is very large, consisting of shares in a great many villages, and considerable areas of b\u00e1r land. The Sard\u00e1rn\u00ed is a sister of Sard\u00e1r Badan Singh of Malaudh.\n\nBesides the Malaudh family, there are one or two others which hold smaller j\u00e1g\u00edrs in the Ludhi\u00e1na tahsil. The Khosa family of Jats belong really to Bankandi in Ferozepore district. They hold three or four villages in shares with the Malaudh family. Their revenue is Rs. 3,353.\n\nThere are two families of Kal\u00e1l j\u00e1g\u00edrd\u00e1rs at Butdhr\u00ed and H\u00e1ns, who hold the villages given them by the Ahl\u00faw\u00e1lia Chief. Their income is Rs. 2,506.\n\nThe Bh\u00e1i of B\u00e1gr\u00edan has been already mentioned in the preceding paragraph. He has a j\u00e1g\u00edr of four villages in this district with a revenue of Rs. 6,061, as an endowment of his Langar or alms-house.\n\nThe Bh\u00e1i of Arnauli, who has a j\u00e1g\u00edr in Umballa, holds one village (revenue Rs. 1,800) in this tahsil.\n\nOf the K\u00e1kars who held the Ludhi\u00e1na B\u00e9t at the end of the last century there is one representative, who resides in B\u00e1ranh\u00e1ra, and is in receipt of a pension; while an adoptive grandson of Sudha Singh, Gil, also gets an allowance and lives at Mangat.\n\nThe children of Maulvi Rajab Ali, the well-known M\u00edr Munshi of the Lahore Board of Administration, reside in Jagraon, where they have very fine houses; and they hold two villages of this tahsil with a revenue of Rs. 3,092 in j\u00e1g\u00edr. The founder of the family was Muhammad Zafar, a Saiad, who settled in the neighbourhood of Jagraon under the Emperor Muhammad Sh\u00e1h, and got a grant of some villages round Talwandi Kal\u00e1n. His descendants lost their possessions when the Sikhs took the country from the Rais. Rajab Ali subsequently recovered the j\u00e1g\u00edr of two villages.\nThe pedigree is\u2014\n\nLeading Families.\nJagraon tahsil:\nThe family of Rajab Ali.\n\nNone of the present generation have taken service. The tomb of Faqirulla still stands in Talwandi. There are Sodhi families in Mallah, Bhamipur and elsewhere, holding petty jagirs which are gradually lapsing; and Jat families in Rajuanah and Tughal; but these do not deserve mention.\n\nThe Rais of Rakot played such an important part in the history of this district that it will be well to give some of the details connected with the family. They belong to the Manj got or subdivision of the Rajput tribe; and the ancestor of the Rais, Rana Mokal, is said to have come from Bhatanir (or Jesalmir), and to have settled in what is now Faridkot territory. Fourth in descent from him was Tulsi Das, who became a Muhammadan in the reign of the Emperor Ghiyas-ud-din Ghori, the family chronicle says, that is about the middle of the 12th century (the same period as that to which the Ghorewah Rajputs of the east ascribe their arrival in the part of the country now held by them), and was called Shekh Chachu. His sons, Bharu and Lapal, came to Hatar, a large village in the Jagraon tahsil, where they appear to have lived by plunder under the shade of an importunate Panwar Rajput, called Udho, the circumstance being recorded in the popular tradition \"Khun pium Bharu Rai: Pakara jana Udho Panwar,\" which means that Bharu got the plunder, and Udho the blows. Finally Bharu made himself master of Hatar, while Lapal settled in the adjoining Shahjahapur, which his descendants still own. Seventh in descent from Bharu was Kalha I, who took service with a Delhi Emperor called Alaud-din, perhaps the last of the Saiad dynasty, at all events in the beginning of the 15th century. Kalha founded Talwandi, to which place the family moved; and obtained an assignment of the malyuzari of villages in the neighbourhood, for which he had to pay Rs. 1,25,000 of revenue, and also the title of Rai. The family maintained its position as a feudatory of the empire (zamindar or mustajir) under the Lodis and Mughals for several generations, and one of the Rais is said by the family chronicle to have been put to death for refusing a daughter in marriage to the Emperor Akbar. On the decline of the Mughal empire from the beginning of the 18th century the Rais became involved in disputes with the Governor of Sirhind; and Rai Kalha III, who appears to have been a ruler of very great ability, extended his power up to Ludhiana, which passed into his hands a few years before the capture of Sirhind by the Sikhs in the manner described in Chapter II. After that event he established independent power over the whole of the Jagraon and the greater part of Ludhiana tahsils, and also a large portion of the Ferozepore district.\nThe family was on at least equal terms with the Path\u00e1n rulers of M\u00e1l\u00e9 K\u00f3tla and of the Phulkian Chiefs, with the latter of whom their relations were very friendly on the whole. It was in the time of R\u00e1\u00ed Ahmad, successor of Kalha III, that R\u00e1ekot was built; and many other towns and villages, amongst them Jagraon, owe their origin to the family, whose rule appears to have been very mild. R\u00e1\u00ed Kalha III was much the ablest of the R\u00e1\u00eds; and under him the family reached the height of its power. He was followed by his son Ahmad, who ruled only a short time. In 1779 A.D., R\u00e1\u00ed Ali\u00e1s, a minor, succeeded, and the affairs of the State were managed by two G\u00fajars, called Roshan and Ahmad, the latter of whom asserted his independence at Jagraon, but was expelled. It was at this time that the Sikhs from across the Sutlej commenced their attacks under the Bed\u00eds, and Roshan was killed in an engagement with them.\n\nThe Bed\u00eds got temporary possession of Ludhi\u00e1na, and some of the country about; but Pati\u00e1la and other Cis-Sutlej powers took up the cause of the R\u00e1\u00eds; and the Bed\u00eds were expelled. In 1802, R\u00e1\u00ed Ali\u00e1s was accidentally killed while hunting near Jagraon, and there were left of the family only two women\u2014N\u00far-ul-m\u00edsa, his mother, and Bh\u00e1gbhari, his widow. In 1806 Runjit Singh made his first expedition into this part of the country; and without a struggle dispossessed the R\u00e1\u00eds of all their possessions, save two or three villages which he allowed for their maintenance. On annexation of the country by us, this j\u00e1g\u00edr was continued to Bh\u00e1gbhari till her death in 1854, when it lapsed. The representatives of the family now left are Im\u00e1m Bakhsh, son of Bh\u00e1gbhari's brother, and Ahmad Kh\u00e1n, another distant relation of the last R\u00e1\u00ed. The former of these Bh\u00e1gbhari adopted, and he receives a pension of Rs. 200 per mensem for his life. Both have considerable possessions, Ahmad Kh\u00e1n and his brother owning two whole villages, besides their share in the ancestral lands in Talwandi and R\u00e1ekot. The houses belonging to the family in R\u00e1ekot and Talwandi are in the hands of these gentlemen, but with Hatur they have now no connection.\n\nSome mention should be made of the political refugees and pensioners, who followed us from Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n in 1842, and had Ludhi\u00e1na assigned to them as a place of residence. The family and dependants of Sh\u00e1h Sh\u00faja have resided here since our withdrawal from Cabul in 1842. Sh\u00e1hz\u00e1da Sh\u00e1hpur is the son of Sh\u00e1h Sh\u00faja, and was proclaimed Am\u00edr on his father's death; but he enjoyed the dignity for only a few days. Another of the family; Sh\u00e1hz\u00e1da N\u00e1dir is an Honorary Magistrate, and several of the rising generation have entered our service in various capacities. The family altogether receive Rs. 1,815 per mensem in political pensions. The family of Abdul Rahm\u00e1n Kh\u00e1n, the Naw\u00e1b of Jhajjar; executed in 1857, were sent here after the Mutiny, and have since resided, drawing pensions which aggregate Rs. 2,300. There are three sons of Abdul Rahm\u00e1n and an uncle, Ali Muhammad, who appears to be the leading man of the family. Saleh Muhammad Kh\u00e1n, who came with us from Cabul in 1842, was in receipt of a pension of Rs. 1,000 per mensem, and his son has succeeded to half\nof it. Another Cabul pensioner of note was Muhammad Hassan Kh\u00e1n, who also distinguished himself in the Mutiny. He had a pension of Rs. 800, and his family have now about Rs. 300 per mensem. The well-known Mohan L\u00e1l (Agha S\u00e1hib), Hindu, Christian and Muhammadan, lived for many years here, and has left some descendants of various religions.\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nPRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION.\n\nSECTION A.\u2014AGRICULTURE AND ARBORICULTURE.\n\nTable No. XIV gives general figures for cultivation and irrigation, and for Government waste land; while the rainfall is shown in Tables Nos. III and IIIA and B. Table No. XVII shows statistics of Government estates, and Table No. XVIII of forests. Table No. XX gives the areas under the principal staples, and Table No. XXI the average yield of each. Statistics of live-stock will be found in Table No. XXII. Further statistics are given under their various headings in the subsequent paragraphs of this chapter. Land tenures, tenants, and rent, the system of agricultural partnerships, and the employment of field labour, have already been noticed in Chapter III at pp. 89\u201493. The areas for soils, crops, irrigation, and the like, taken from the figures of the Revised Settlement, are given below under the respective headings.\n\nThe total annual fall of rain and the manner in which it is distributed throughout the year are shown in Tables III, IIIA, IIIB; while some mention of the seasons as they affect the staple food-grains has been made in Section B of Chapter III (page 55). An agricultural calendar will be found below at page 124.\n\nThe agricultural year begins with the Nim\u00e1nia, which is the first of the half monthly fasts of the Hind\u00fas, and falls about the 15th June. Lands are rented and accounts cleared up by this date, and generally a new start made for the year. Most of the land has been enjoying a rest of two or three months, the exceptions being where sugarcane, some of the cotton, and patches of tobacco and vegetables round the wells occupy portions of it. The monsoon breaks from ten to twenty days after the Nim\u00e1nia, towards the end of the month of H\u00e1r; and agricultural operations commence at once with the sowing of the various autumn crops, except the cane and cotton which are already in the ground. Falls of rain at intervals during the months of July-September bring the autumn harvest to maturity; and in September the final ploughings for sowing the Rabi crops (the land has been carefully prepared before) commence. From the middle of September to the end of October the Rabi sowings go on, and from the end of October to the middle of November the Khar\u00edf grain crops are reaped, and the cotton pickings begin. This period of two months (15th September to 15th November) is much the busiest time for the cultivator. If the rainfall has been good, the Rabi sowings are completed early in November; but, if the rains have ceased too early, and there is not a sufficient amount of moisture for the sowings, they go on into December, and a late shower in October or November is then of the greatest use. The benefits of a fall at this time are celebrated in the popular couplet:\u2014\n\nJe minh pia Diw\u00e1li,\nJin phus, Jin h\u00e1ll.\n\"With rain at the Diwali (end of October) a worthless fellow and a good cultivator are on equal terms.\" The Rabi crops are brought on by showers at two periods of the cold weather, about Christmas and towards the end of February; and reaping begins from the Baisakhi day (1st Baisakh, about April 15th), and the threshing is completed early in May. The sugarcane crop will not fit into the regular round of the farmer's year, and requires a special course of its own. It is sown in March, is cut and pressed after the middle of November, when the other Kharif harvesting and the Rabi sowing have been finished. Cotton is sown before the regular Kharif seed time, but it fits into the harvesting season, being picked at intervals during November-December.\n\nThe areas of the different kinds of soil which were separately recorded at the Settlement of 1880, are given on the next page as they stood in acres.\n\nThere are a number of soils recognized by the people, and with appropriate names. Our Regular Settlement introduced an elaborate classification, but the names used were known in the country before this. The land round a village site is referred to as niati because of its situation even in the Jangal villages, where there is no irrigation, and no soil so designated in the Government papers. Dakhar, applied to hard soils, is a term that has been in use from time immemorial in the district. In the uplands the Jat will divide his land into senju (irrigated) and maru (unirrigated). The latter he will, in speaking to a revenue officer, describe as tibba or ret, and sometimes as budhi if there is any appearance of sand to justify him; or, if the soil is a good even loam, he will tell you it is pilak, which is a very coarse cakey soil, almost barren, and worse even than sand. If it is a good dark stiff soil, he will tell you it is rarra, chilan or kallar. In a village with light soils the people will speak with apparent envy of the dakhar or clay loam of some other village, where the crops are so good; while the owners of this latter sort of soil sigh for the light lands (called resli) of their neighbours, which require little ploughing, and where the crops spring in the driest of years. In the Bet the people speak of mand or flooded land; rakar or kallar, hard land yielding little; passi, or soil in which the sand is very near the surface.\n\nIn the Regular Settlement the terms used were niati or land adjoining the site and heavily manured; dakhar, or hard clay soil; rausti or ordinary loam; and bhur or sand. These when distributed over the irrigated and unirrigated lands gave much too elaborate a classification. Thus in the Dharia there were these classes of irrigated lands: Niati chahi, dakhar chahi, rausti chahi, bhur chahi, and finally mohita chahi, or unirrigated land capable of being watered by a well. Of the Settlement now in progress, Mr. Walker writes: \"We have simplified the classification as far as we could, and have divided all lands for assessment purposes into\u2014For the Dharia: (1) niati chahi or first-class irrigated land adjoining the site; (2) other well lands; (3) unirrigated dakhar or rausti, i.e., loam; and (4) bhur or sand. The first of these is an artificial class, but the division of unirrigated lands...\"\n### Chapter IV.

In the B\u00e9t no natural classification was attempted; but the lands were recorded as (1) manured and ordinarily bearing two crops (dofasli), and (2) unmanured, bearing one crop (ekfasli). These divisions are quite enough for practical purposes, and I do not think that anything would have been gained by attempting a more elaborate classification. In the uplands I began by having three classes of unirrigated lands: clay loam (d\u00e1khar), sandy loam (rausli) and sand (bh\u00far); but further experience induced me to combine the first two. In the B\u00e9t there is great uniformity of soil. The only variations are when the land is newly formed (mand), where it lies low and is moist, or where the sand is near the surface (passi).\n\nIn the uplands it has been pointed out that the lighter soils prevail along the high bank and to the southwest of the district, while those of the eastern portions are much stiffer. Putting irrigation aside, the best soil is that which best suits the rainfall. A hard d\u00e1khar soil requires a great deal of rain, which it generally gets for the Kharif harvest; but even this crop suffers from breaks in the rains. But the most critical period of the whole year is the time of the Rabi sowing. It is well known that a clay soil is capable of absorbing a much greater amount of moisture than a sandy one; but the former requires a very heavy rainfall to saturate it thoroughly, and dries much more easily, which is a very important point in this climate. D\u00e1khar land requires to be thoroughly moist before ploughing is possible at all; and even if it has been reduced to a good tilth, and the rains have stopped too early, it will often be found to have lost all its moisture; and the cultivator knows he may spare his seed, for it will not germinate. If the moisture for sowings is good, and if the usual winter rains do not hold off and are also sufficient, the produce of d\u00e1khar will be much heavier than that of any other soil; but it is seldom that all these contingencies turn out as the cultivator would wish them to. On the other hand rausli or sandy loam is very safe for the rain crops. It requires little ploughing; and, though not capable of holding so much as d\u00e1khar, retains moisture in the subsoil much better. For weeks after rausli land has been ploughed and rolled preparatory to sowing, it will be found that there is good moisture at a few inches from the surface. Thus the best soil of the district for rain cultivation is the rausli, for it is never without a crop; while, even in the Samr\u00e1la villages with a higher rainfall than elsewhere, we find that every fourth or fifth year a great part of the unirrigated land has no crop, because sowing was impossible for want of moisture. Many villages have both light and stiff soils in their area; and this is the most desirable combination. Bh\u00far is often called sand, but it is really a shifting and sandy soil on a good subsoil. Bh\u00far lands are poor, and the crops on them are in the most favourable years rather weak, but they have the advantages of needing almost no tillage and retaining what moisture they get most tenaciously in the subsoil. They suffer, however, in a year of heavy rainfall, and in the villages along the high bank the crop is generally best when that of the lands further inland is drying, or when no sowings have been possible.\nIn the B\u00e9t, r\u00e9h or the saline efflorescence, due to impeded under-ground drainage, is common along the Budha N\u00e1la, but not elsewhere, except to the west of Ludhi\u00e1na. In the neighbourhood of N\u00farpur barren patches will be found in the wheat fields; while further west, in the villages surrounding the plain of Aliw\u00e1l, the surface is encrusted with it, the land being apparently water-logged, as is proved by the large area under water which has oozed out of the ground just below the high bank under Bharow\u00e1l. Elsewhere in the B\u00e9t and in the harder soils of the Dh\u00e1in, the land may show a tendency to saltiness, specially in drainage lines, this being evident from the failure of the crop to germinate; such soils are called chilan or kallor. P\u00edlak is soil of a deep yellow colour, more or less unfruitful, and distinguishable by its tendency to cake. It appears to be composed of a large grained coarse sand, like gravel; and is the worst of all Dh\u00e1in soils.\n\nTable No. XIV gives details of irrigation. Further information will be found at pages 177 to 203 of Major Wace's Famine Report compiled in 1878. At that time 17 per cent. of the cultivation was irrigated from wells, 1 per cent. was flooded, and the remaining 82 per cent. was wholly dependent upon rain. The following figures show certain statistics regarding the wells then existing in the district:\n\n| Depth to Water in Feet | Cost in Rupees | Bullocks per Wheel or Bucket | Acres Irrigated per Wheel or Bucket |\n|------------------------|---------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| From To                | Masonry       | Without masonry             | Number of Pairs | Cost in Rupees | Gear | Spring | Autumn |\n| 20                     | 70\u2014150        | 5\u201410                        | 4               | 50\u201460          | 10   | 0      | 9      |\n| 30                     | 200\u2014300       |                             |                 | 60\u201480          | 10   | 10     | 6      |\n| 40                     | 300\u2014450       |                             |                 | 80\u2014130         | 10   | 10     | 6      |\n| 60                     | 450\u2014550       |                             |                 | 100\u2014200        | 10   | 10     | 6      |\n\nThe total number of wells was 11,418, of which 2,350 were unbricked. The soil areas, given above at page 117, show details of irrigation. The table on the next page is taken from the report on the Revised Settlement (1879-83).\n\nOf the total cultivation of the district 15 per cent. is now returned as irrigated. The irrigation is at the present time entirely from wells. In the B\u00e9t the depth of the water below the surface is only eight to ten feet, and the lift very easy. The wells here are of two sorts. There are kachcha or temporary wells with a lining made of pilchi, the water being raised in an earthen pot suspended from the end of a lever or pole, the other end of which is heavily weighted. The pot is pulled down into the well by a string attached to that end of the pole; and the weight at the other end raises it when full to the surface, where it is emptied into the irrigating channel. This apparatus is called a dhunkali, and has the advantage of only requiring one man to work it. There are also masonry wells of small diameter, worked like the\n### Chapter IV, A.\n\n**Agriculture and Arboriculture.**\n\n**Irrigation.**\n\n| WATER CAPACITY OF WELLS |\n|--------------------------|\n| **Khals.**               |\n| **Nial.**                 |\n| **Names of Taluqdar.**   |\n\n| **Classified Statement of Masonry Wells.** |\n|-------------------------------------------|\n| **Khals.**                               |\n| **Nial.**                                 |\n| **Names of Taluqdar.**                    |\n\n| **Average depth of well in feet.** |\n|------------------------------------|\n| **Average cost of construction per foot.** |\n| **Average crop irrigated per bigha.** |\n| **Number of wells of each type.** |\n| **Total.**                           |\n\n| **Total.** |\n|------------|\n|            |\nother wells of the district with a bucket raised by bullocks. At the Regular Settlement there appear to have been very few masonry wells, and people were content with the simpler dhinkali; but within the last 25 years nearly one thousand masonry wells have been sunk, mostly in the villages just below Ludhiana city and to the west, for irrigation is not required in B\u00e9t lands further east. The dhinkali is capable of watering only about an acre of land; and, although the Ar\u00e1n cultivator can grow a great deal in this small area, he can do much more with cattle and a permanent well capable of watering six to seven acres; and the change is a decided advance. The Persian wheel is used in one or two villages in the Jagraon B\u00e9t, adjoining Ferozepore.\n\nIn the Dh\u00e1ia the wells are all of masonry. The water is raised by means of a rope and leather bucket (l\u00e1o, charsa), worked by two pairs of bullocks alternately going down an inclined plane or run. The rope works over a wheel or pulley, raised a little above the well on a forked stick. To one end of the rope is attached the bucket, and the other is fixed to the yoke of the bullocks, which are driven down the run. When the bucket rises to the top, it is rested on the edge of a reservoir and emptied into it by a man standing there for the purpose, when the rope is unfastened from the yoke and the bucket allowed to descend into the well. Three or four men and two pairs of bullocks are required for one bucket, and can work for three or four hours at a stretch. For the continuous working of a single bucket-well four pairs of bullocks and six or eight men are necessary. With this complement it will go on for the whole day. Nearly half of the wells in the district have two buckets and two sets of gear completely separate, so that both are worked at the same time. These are much wider than the single bucket wells, being 11 or 12 feet in diameter (while the latter are generally 7 or 8), and cost more to construct. The usual cost is from Rs. 250 to Rs. 300 for a single, and from Rs. 400 to Rs. 500 for a double well. The compensation paid for wells destroyed by the Sirhind Canal in 1869 averaged between Rs. 400 and 500. Irrigation is also given in places (B\u00e9t and Dh\u00e1ia) from village tanks, the water being raised three or four feet to the level of the fields by means of a basket worked by two men with ropes; but this is only possible at certain times of the year when the tanks are full. The water is first run into a small well or reservoir (called chuh\u00ed), and thence raised by a basket (called dal) into the irrigation channel. The basket is lined with leather, and has two ropes attached to it, one passing under each side and coming out at the corners. Two men stand on opposite sides of the well holding the two ends of each rope, and raise the water in the basket.\n\nThe distance of the water from the surface and the depth of the water in the wells has been recorded for every village in the district. The result of this record is to show that beyond the influence of the river, which affects the water level to some distance from the high bank, the depth below the surface of the water in the wells diminishes as one goes from north-east to south-west in Samr\u00e1la and the continuous part of the Ludhiana tahsil. This\nvariation is most marked in Samr\u00e1la, where it is from 42 or 43 feet in the villages to the south of Bahlolpur, to 30 feet at T\u00e9ru, and 27 feet in the detached villages to the south-west of this tahsil, and also about Malaudh (Ludhi\u00e1na tahsil). In Ludhi\u00e1na the variation is not so great, the recorded depth being not less than 35 feet in any of the villages about Pakhow\u00e1l; while beyond our boundary the depth increases, till we reach 75 feet at Sahna, and upwards of 100 beyond it. In Jagraon there is no such fall of spring level; but the depth to the water is much the same as in all the eastern villages of that tahsil, while it increases towards the southwest, being upwards of 50 feet at Hatur in the south-west corner. Thus we have a spring level which approaches the surface in the eastern portion of the district to the distance of some 40 or 50 miles in the same direction as the slope of the country, and then gets deeper, till in some of the Jangal villages water for drinking purposes is raised with very great labour; while in the western portion of the district with the same slope there is a steady fall from the first.\n\nThe depth of water in the wells varies a good deal according to locality and season. It is generally twelve or fifteen feet, but in a dry year will fall much lower. It is said that during the last few years the level has been high. The amount of water which can be drawn out of a well depends on the source from which it is fed. The supply from beneath the lower clay is inexhaustible; but most wells are filled from the sand, and are liable to be worked dry, especially where the rainfall has been deficient.\n\nThe method of sinking a well is as follows. An excavation of the size designed for the well is first made through the upper stratum of clay soil till the sand is reached, generally at a depth of fifteen to twenty feet: and at the bottom of this is laid down the chak or cylindrical frame-work of wood on which the masonry lining of the well is to be rested. This lining is built up to the surface, and above it to a height of eight or ten feet, and weighted down while the sand at the bottom is scooped out. The structure gradually sinks through the sand, the chak keeping it firm. Three sorts of sand are met with in the excavation: first, fine dry sand (called reti), and then moist, coarser sand (reto), and finally sand which comes out in lumps mixed with pieces of clay or kankar (called ghati); and it is from this last that the water is generally drawn. The sinker says that a good foundation has been reached (pathan lag gaya). The top of the well is then finished, and the reservoirs and other appliances built. In some villages the lower stratum of clay is reached (called pandu), and this gives a sure foundation for the well. A hole about a foot in diameter is driven through the clay into the sand below it by means of a pointed iron instrument; and the water rises as in a spring. It is a great piece of luck to have a well founded on the pandu for it can never fall in, and the supply of water is unlimited. Such a well is generally worked with three or four buckets. The pandu is said to be reached in most well-sinking villages about Malaudh and occasionally elsewhere. A well not founded on the pandu besides having a supply of water that is liable to be exhausted,\nmay suddenly disappear altogether, or gradually subside, the foundation being undermined by the action of the bucket.\n\nWells are worked with one, two, three and even four buckets; and we cannot judge of the irrigating power by merely striking an average of the area for each well. It is usually calculated that a two-bucket well can irrigate half as much again as a single well; and at this rate we have the average area watered by one of the latter sort 12 acres, and by one of the former 18 (in the Dh\u00e1ia). The following is an extract from the Assessment Report of Samr\u00e1la: \"But to form an idea of the irrigating power of a well, we must examine the area under the various crops and the seasons during which they are irrigated. Roughly speaking, the Rabi crop is irrigated for six months (October to March), and the sugarcane crop for ten months (May to February). The other Kharif crops, cotton and maize, require irrigation for nearly four months (July to October). The number of waterings given varies with the character of the season; but generally the Rabi crop requires one every twenty days, and the cane once a week. Taking the Rabi crop then, we have 28,000 acres watered once in three weeks, or 9,300 once a week, and 6,200 of sugarcane. This gives about five acres watered every week by a one-bucket well. In the Kharif the area is naturally a good deal less. The estimate given me by zamind\u00e1rs is one bigah (pucka), or five-eighths acre a day for each bucket.\" The average area watered by a masonry well in the B\u00e9t is nearly seven acres, which bears about 12 acres of crop in the year.\n\nIt is expected that irrigation from the Sirhind Canal will be commenced from the Rabi of 1883-84 in the villages to the south-west of the district; and in a few years it is likely to be extended to all villages in the uplands lying west of the M\u00e1ler Kotla road. The distributaries are at present under construction.\n\nTable No. XXII shows the number of cattle, carts and ploughs in each tahsil of the district as returned in 1878-79.\n\nThe plough (hal) universally used is the mona (see \"Punjab Manufactures,\" page 314), which is decidedly the best of the two patterns in use in the province, being much stronger than the other. It is of course a primitive implement, with no mould board and no turning action; but it opens the soil to a depth of eight or ten inches, and produces a fine tilth. The various parts of it are called mona (the block), thail or arli (the handle), ph\u00e1la and ch\u00e1o (share and coulter), halas (beam). The bullocks are yoked by a panj\u00e1li, or frame-work passing over their heads into which the halas is fixed. To the plough is attached, when necessary, a por or tube made of bamboo hollowed, with a leather mouth, through which the seed is drilled. Ploughing is followed by rolling with a soh\u00e1ga, a beam of wood to which the cattle are yoked, the man standing on it and driving. The soh\u00e1ga is also used in stiff soils for clod crushing. Pard\u00edn is the goad for driving the bullocks. Jindra * is a rake without teeth, worked by two men, from one side with a handle, from the other with a rope. It is with this that the irrigated lands are ridged off into kidris or plots for irrigation. The kahi or mattock is mostly used in making the irrigation channels (adh). The hoeing is done with a ramba\nor *khurpa*, a trowel with a crooked handle. The crop is reaped with a *diltri* or sickle, and threshed with a contrivance called *phatta*, and winnowed by being thrown into the air with a pitchfork (*salang*) or from a basket called *tangali*. The other chief implements are the *salang*, a wooden fork with two prongs used as above, and also for making up hedges, &c.; the *kar\u00e1*, an iron rake or cutter, used in place of the *jindra* and worked with bullocks in very stiff soil for levelling, &c.; the *koh\u00e1ri* or common axe for cutting wood; *gand\u00e1sia*, an axe or chopper with a long handle, the blade being a thin piece of iron about an inch wide and six inches long fastened to the end by two spikes of iron; a *gand\u00e1s\u00ed*, the same with a short handle for chopping fodder; a *gand\u00fal\u00e1* or stick tipped with iron for making holes into which the branches set up in the hedges are set. The principal parts of the well-gear are the *charsa* or bucket; the *ldo* or rope with which it is raised; the *pdoni* and *kohir*, wheel on which the rope works and fork in which it fits. Water is raised from tanks, &c., by a basket lined with leather worked by two men with ropes (called *dal*). The sugarcane press is called a *belna* or *kulh\u00e1ri*, and a description of it will be found elsewhere. Small carts are used by most cultivators for bringing the harvest from the field, carrying manure, &c. They are of the ordinary pattern of country cart, but do not go beyond the village.\n\nThe following is a calendar showing the ordinary round of agricultural work of the year:\n\n| No | Vernacular | English | State of Agriculture |\n|----|------------|---------|----------------------|\n| 1  | Ch\u00e1t       | March-April | Cane planted up to 15th.

The operations of agriculture differ in the various portions of the district according to the crops grown, and presence or absence of irrigation.\n\nIn the uplands the wells generally lie round the village site in a ring, the unirrigated lands being outside of this. In some of the small villages of the Kheri il\u00e1ga (Samr\u00e1la) the whole area is practically irrigated, and in most villages of this tahsil upwards of 40 per cent. is regularly watered. As we go westwards the proportion gradually decreases to about 10 per cent. in Jagraon tahsil, while the outlying villages to the south have none at all. The irrigated cultivation is best studied in Samr\u00e1la, where it is in greatest proportion, and here it varies in quality from that in the rich nidi land adjoining the site on which is deposited all the natural filth of the village besides what it receives from the manure heaps, to the land attached to distant wells, to which manure is with difficulty conveyed and grudgingly given. The nidi circle comes so close to the site as just to leave room for a road. It may be said to be always under crop, and regularly bears two harvests in the year. In January or February, while the Rabi crops...\nare growing, the fields selected for sugarcane are manured, watered and then ploughed till the soil is reduced to a fine tilth to the depth of eight or ten inches. The cane is then planted (March-April) and watered at intervals. Then the fields for cotton are treated in the same way, and most of the crop sown before the rains in April-June. When the rains begin it is time to sow the maize, and this is done from the middle to end of July in land prepared in the same way as for the other two crops. The maize fields are those nearest to the village and the richest, what the people specially denote as *nid\u012b*, or land adjoining the site. The tilth produced by the preparation for these crops is very fine, being the result of successive ploughings and rollings. When the seed has been put down the field is banked off into small divisions (*k\u016bdris*) with a rake (*jindra*) for the purposes of irrigation, each of these being flushed with water in succession. This closes the Kharif sowings in irrigated land. After the first one or two waterings the fields are in the case of all three crops carefully hoed, the cultivators working through them steadily in a line, removing grass and weeds and loosening the earth, which is apt to cake from the watering and stop the growth of the plant. The amount of irrigation which these crops receive depends on the character of the rains.\n\nThe cane has to be kept alive through the hottest part of the year, but luckily it is the only crop to be attended to then. After the rains have commenced the well has to be turned on whenever there is a break, and the necessity is more constant towards the end of the hot weather. It is when these crops have grown to their full height that the Samr\u0101la and eastern Ludhi\u0101na villages look their best, being surrounded to the distance of 200 or 300 yards by a magnificent growth of maize and cane eight or ten feet high. The maize is ripe by the end of October, and is reaped in the beginning of November. The sugarcane is generally ready for cutting about the beginning of December, and the cutting and pressing go on into March. The Rabi sowings of wheat and barley in irrigated lands are made in the beginning of November, either in fields near the site which have just borne a crop of maize, or on more distant ones which have been lying fallow (*saduca*) during the Kharif. If there is not sufficient natural moisture, a watering is given from the well, and this is generally necessary. Several ploughings in succession produce, as in the Kharif, a fine tilth, and the seed is sown broadcast, ploughed in, and the land rolled and banked for irrigation. The crop gets one watering a few days after sowing, and others at intervals till within a short time of its ripening, the number of waterings depending on the amount of rain. The Rabi is off the ground by the end of April and is followed by small patches of tobacco, onions, &c., which grow in April-June; but most of the land not under sugarcane is left alone for two months till the rain falls. When land bears two crops in the year, (or the equivalent one of cane) it is called *dos\u0101li hars\u0101l\u0101*, i.e., bearing two crops every year. Where a fallow is usually given, the system is *ekf\u0101sli hars\u0101l\u0101*, i.e., only one crop in the year is grown. This description of irrigated cultivation will apply to villages in the Jagraon tahsil if we cut out the\nsugarcane and cotton. The maize gets all the attention and the supply of manure distributed in Samrala between the three crops, being the only Kharif at the wells. It occupies ten out of a total of sixteen thousand acres of irrigation in this tahsil.\n\nIn the Dh\u00e1ia unirrigated lands there is a very well established system of cultivation. To explain it, we must begin with land from which a Kharif crop has just been taken. When the rain falls in M\u00e1g\u00e1h (January-February) the field is ploughed and left open to the action of the elements. If the cultivator has time, he may plough it again whenever there is a fall of rain, but it is not often that he can do this. When the autumn rains fall, phoughings again commence in July, and the land gets a number of them in succession, and is prepared for the Rabi sowings, having had a year's fallow, and being reduced to a very fine tilth by the final ploughings in September. Sowings ordinarily commence from the middle of September, the gram being the earliest crop in the ground, and being followed by wheat and gram (mixed), wheat, barley, in this order; they go on in ordinary years till the beginning of November, and till much later if the rainfall is bad. The fields are weeded at intervals, p\u00faj\u00ed, thistles, &c., being carefully removed. The crop ripens in April, and harvesting begins about the Bais\u00e1kh\u00ed day (10th-15th April), a little being done before that. When the monsoon rains begin, the land out of which this Rabi crop has been taken is ploughed once, and the Kharif pulses and millets sown in it without further preparation, as none is really necessary. The Kharif ripens at the end of October. The course of cultivation sketched above extends over two years, in the first of which the land bears no crop, although really the Rabi of one year is followed by the Kharif of the next; but of course the whole of a cultivator's land does not go through the various stages at the same time. Part of it will be under crop at the time that the rest is enjoying a fallow. The manner in which the lands of a village are generally distributed amongst the community has been already noticed in the Section on Tenures (page 89), each sharer having a portion in each of the blocks into which the lands are divided, and his fields being scattered all over the area of the village or subdivision. It is obviously convenient for the people of adjoining fields to have their land under crop or fallow at the same time, and in fact the members of the community always pull together in this matter, with the result that the village area will be found mapped out into blocks of fields which are either cropped or fallow at the same time. In small villages there may be only two such blocks, but there are usually a good many. Besides the advantage of the system as best suited for the land, it has others incidental to it, such as the convenience of being able to graze the cattle over a large piece of fallow, and the facilities for watching the crops.\n\nThis system of cultivation (which has been named dof\u00e1shi d\u00f3s\u00e1la, or the two years' course, the land yielding two crops in two years) may be said to extend generally over the Dh\u00e1ia; but in the light soils immediately over the ridge or high bank (the Lower Dh\u00e1ia Assessment Circles) the area under the Rabi is much larger than that under the Kharif, because for various reasons the\nformer is found to pay better, and a large proportion of the land is under Rabi every year (ekfaasli harsala).\n\nIn the eastern portion of the B\u00e9t there is no irrigation, but the soil is naturally moist, and the cultivation of manured land is of the same nature as that of irrigated land in the Dh\u00e1ia, cane, cotton and wheat being the crops. The nidi area generally lies round the site, but not as a matter of course, for there are no wells to make it necessary that the superior crops should be raised in a fixed area, and we accordingly find that it is very often shifted. In fact two crops or sugarcane can be grown in any land that gets sufficient manure, though it is generally convenient to have these crops near to the village. Except for the waterings, the description of the irrigated cultivation of the Dh\u00e1ia will apply to the manured lands of the B\u00e9t. In the western half of the B\u00e9t there is a great deal of irrigation, and the superior cultivation is all at the wells. Maize followed by wheat is grown as in the uplands, and there is also some very fine market garden cultivation, especially under the city of Ludhi\u00e1na, from which an ample supply of manure is drawn.\n\nIn the B\u00e9t the dofaasi doddla system of cultivation is followed for unmanured lands in villages at a distance from the river; but even here the area under wheat is larger than that of the Kharif. In this case all the land in turn is generally put through the two years' course. Thus a field will bear a Rabi for three or four years in succession, and then this will be followed by a Kharif, to which will succeed a year's fallow. In the moister lands near to the river a Rabi is grown year after year. The unmumured Kharif crop is nowhere of much importance in the B\u00e9t. The newly recovered lands in the Mand are ploughed up roughly the first year; and massar or some other poor crop sown, often without removal of the pilchi and reeds. Next year the land receives better tillage and is cleared, the crop being a mixture of massar with wheat or barley; and in the third or fourth year wheat alone is grown, the soil having become quite clean. The Rabi in these new moist lands is often preceded by a Kharif of rice, m\u00e1sh, maize, &c. As a whole the agriculture of the B\u00e9t is much inferior to that of the Dh\u00e1ia. There are no light soils like the rausli of the uplands, and the land requires much greater labour, and is naturally foul with weeds. Besides this the Muhammadan proprietors, except the Ar\u00e1ins and Aw\u00e1ns, are generally rather poor cultivators. The fields immediately round the site, or at the wells where there is irrigation, are kept clear enough; but in the outlying ones the crop will generally be found choked with weeds, the result of insufficient ploughing and failure to attempt keeping them down.\n\nIn irrigated lands preparation of the land for a crop by ploughing can begin at any time. The field is flooded and allowed to dry partially, and then ploughed five or six times in succession. This is always the method of preparation for maize and wheat; but for cane the land is fallow (s\u00e1me) during the cold weather; and it is often ploughed like unirrigated lands with the aid of the winter rains. For cane it is said that eight or ten ploughings are necessary, and as many as 15 or 20 may be given. Maize generally gets five or six, and wheat, four or five in irrigated land. Where the two years\ncourse is followed in unirrigated lands, there are three recognized seasons for ploughing. When the rain falls in M\u00e2gh (January-February) the field from which a crop has been taken in October is ploughed twice in opposite directions and left open to the action of the elements. If subsequent showers fall the cultivator may plough it again; but he has seldom time to do this, at all events where sugarcane is grown. The next ploughings commence when the rain falls in S\u00e2wan (June-July); and the land then gets three or four at intervals, being reduced to a good tilth, and then smoothed with a soh\u00e2ga to keep the moisture in. In Bh\u00e2don, when the time for sowing approaches, one or two more ploughings are given according to the nature of the soil. The cold weather ploughing is well recognized by the people as the most important operation of all. The great increase in the fertility of the soil produced by its exposure to the air is easily explained on chemical grounds. The following popular couplet describes the value of the ploughings at the various seasons; \"Si\u00e2l Sona; H\u00e2r R\u00fbpa; S\u00e2wan s\u00e2wen r\u00e2wen; Bh\u00e2don be baguchia: Tain ki\u00fbn b\u00e2ha thia 'luchia,\" i.e., \"ploughing in the winter is gold; in H\u00e2r, silver; in S\u00e2wan, indifferent; in Bh\u00e2don it is repentance: what is the use of your going about it, you lazy rascal?\" Where, as in parts of the B\u00eat, the two years' course is not followed, winter ploughings are not possible. For the Khar\u00eef only a couple of ploughings are given in the R\u00e2bi stubble, the seed being sown with the second. Ploughing is always commenced in unirrigated lands a few days after the rain has stopped, when the land is beginning to dry, this condition being called v\u00e2t\u00e2r. Three bullocks are usually taken out to the fields for the work, one always being at rest. The plough does not generally go very deep; in the winter ploughing, six or seven inches; but in those of the rainy season the tilth produced is not less than eight or ten inches, the plough going deeper each time.\n\nSowing of the ordinary grains is done either broadcast (chatta) or by drilling through a tube (tor) into the furrows. The latter method is almost invariably employed in unirrigated lands, where it is desirable to get the seed well under the surface in contact with the moisture; but there is no fixed rule in the matter. In irrigated lands and in the Mand B\u00eat the sowing is broadcast. The people will tell one that in former times when there was plenty of rain this was the case everywhere. The Khar\u00eef crop is sown broadcast, more often than the R\u00e2bi. After sowing the furrows are generally left open, always so in the western parts; but in Samr\u00e2la t\u00e2hs\u00eel the field is sometimes smoothed. Maize and cotton are sown grain by grain by hand. Maize, it is said, should be so widely sown as to enable a man to run between the stalks. The method of planting cane is described below.\n\nHoeing (god\u00ee, gudna) is done with a ramb\u00e2 or trowel, the worker going through the field in a sitting posture, carefully cutting out grass and weeds and loosening the earth round each plant.\n\nThe lands round the village site are always carefully hedged in the Dha\u00efa with kikar or b\u00e9r branches fixed into the ground, and tied together with a rope of cane stalks which have been passed\nthrough the press (thathe.) These hedges are strong, and keep out the cattle very well. They extend along the sides of the various roads leading to the site, and enclose the whole of the irrigated fields. At certain points there are openings with stiles to enable the cultivators to get to their fields. The people are more careful than in any other neighbouring district about keeping animals out of their fields. Each plot or collection of fields of sugarcane has a strong hedge of its own. The unirrigated lands are generally quite open, except in the Jangal villages, where the traffic is often kept to the roads by thick hedges of the prickly mallah or wild b\u00e9r. In the B\u00e9t there is not much hedging of any sort, but the nidi lands are more or less protected according to the disposition of the people.\n\nCutting is done with a sickle (dadri). The cutter goes through the field in a sitting posture, laying down the handfuls as they are cut. These are afterwards tied into sheaves. Maize and jow\u00e1r are collected in a stock (moh\u00e1ra) in the field, the stalks standing upright. After a few days, as the cultivator has time, the heads are pricked off, the maize husked and collected in a heap, where they are beaten with a straight stick till the grain leaves the cob or head. The stalks are stored for fodder on the house-tops or elsewhere. In the case of the other grains the sheaves are collected in the field, the stack being called l\u00f3han, and thence taken to the khalu\u00e1rah or threshing floor at the village, generally on a cart. The place selected for threshing is the hard, beaten ground, such as is found in the goerah of most villages. This is swept clean, and the crop is spread out on it in the form of a circle to the height of two or three feet, and the phala or thresher drawn round and round it by two bullocks driven by a man or boy sitting on it. By the action of the phala and the trampling of the bullocks the straw is broken up fine, and the grain separated from the heads and husk. The phala is a square frame made of four sticks, each about three feet in length, and joined at the corners. The inside is filled with kikar or b\u00e9r branches, covered with one or two sheaves of corn, on the top of which the driver sits. For winnowing a breeze is required. The mixed grain and straw is first tossed into the air with a pitchfork (salang); and the grain separated from the straw. But with the grain a good deal of straw and chaff is still left; and to get rid of this the grain is taken up in a winnowing basket called a chhaj, and allowed to fall gradually from above the thresher's head, the wind blowing the remaining straw and chaff away from the grain. Of all the operations described in this paragraph this last is the only one which the cultivator does not invariably do for himself. The ordinary cultivating proprietor employs no field labour. His women bind the sheaves, and he does everything else himself; but it is the custom in places for the Cham\u00e1r or Ch\u00fah\u00e1ra to work the chhaj. There is none of the waste on reapers' wages and other allowances, such as prevail in many districts. Even the village menials receive but a scanty share of the harvest.\n\nIn the preceding paragraphs an attempt has been made to describe the agriculture of the district as a whole; and to show\nthe system on which the lands of a village are cultivated. From what has been said in the Section on Tenures (page 89) about the constitution of villages, it will be evident that nothing resembling a farm according to European ideas exists, as it does in other parts of the province where the land of a cultivator lies in a lump, generally round a well. The village is made up of a number of holdings owned by separate members of the community; and each owner has in his holding a share in every class of land situated in all parts of the village or subdivision. The operations have in the preceding pages been described separately, but every proprietor has to distribute his time and labour over the various crops, which are of every description, growing in his lands. Thus in Samr\u0101la uplands a proprietary holding consists of about six acres of land, of which $3\\frac{1}{2}$ (roughly) will be unirrigated, and $2\\frac{1}{2}$ irrigated. Of the former again half will be under fodder for the cattle and half under the common food grains; while of the irrigated land less than one acre will be under cane and cotton, and the rest under maize and wheat. But it is not possible for a single man to work a holding (l\u0101hna or kat\u0101na), as he could never alone take his own turn at the well, which requires at least four bullocks and three or four men at a time. In practice 20 or 30 acres are cultivated by a partnership, which may be temporary, the land of the several proprietors being separately owned; or the holding may be really a joint one, belonging to a family containing five or six able-bodied men. This gives the result that large patches of cane, maize, &c., are grown, several fields being clubbed together for each crop. In the Jangal villages, where agriculture is in its simple stage, things are different. The division of the cultivator's labour is easy enough, and the task of cultivation is very light. From July to November the cultivator is more or less busy between sowing and reaping the Khar\u00edf, and preparing the land for and sowing the Rabi. But with the Rabi in the ground there remains almost nothing to be done till it is reaped; and after that absolutely nothing for some months. In Jagraon, where there is not much irrigation, the labour is also light. But in the highly cultivated villages of the east of Ludhi\u0101na and in Samr\u0101la, the work of cultivating a holding is incessant, and wearying alike to man and to beast. There is no rest all the twelve months, except for a few days in the rains; and there is so much to do about the months of October-December that the cultivator often finds that he cannot get through it all; and loses his chance of sowing his Rabi in time, or neglects some other operation.\n\nThe area that can be worked by a pair of bullocks depends on a variety of circumstances. Thus in the B\u0113t the cattle are very poor, and cannot cover much land; and besides this a great part of the area in the upper B\u0113t is cultivated twice every year. In the uplands it is the wells that make the difference, and, of course, the superior cultivation at them. In the B\u0113t it appears from the returns that there is a pair of bullocks to every six or seven acres of cultivation; while in the eastern and highly cultivated uplands the average is eight or ten acres; and in the Jangal it is about seventeen to a yoke. The following are the details for some of the Assessment Circles:\u2014\n### Chapter IV, A.\n\n#### Agriculture and Arboriculture.\n\n| Circle          | No. of cattle (plough and well) | Area cultivated | Average per bullock | Per cent. of Irrigation |\n|-----------------|----------------------------------|-----------------|---------------------|------------------------|\n| B\u00e9t Samr\u00e1la     | ...                              | 5,250           | 18,185              | 3                      | 1                      |\n| B\u00e9t I., Ludhi\u00e1na| ...                              | 6,332           | 21,237              | 3                      | 6                      |\n| Upper Dh\u00e1ia, Samr\u00e1la | ...                        | 25,580          | 107,750             | 4                      | 43                     |\n| Do., Ludhi\u00e1na   | ...                              | 20,557          | 95,109              | 5                      | 22                     |\n| P\u00e9wadh, Ludhi\u00e1na| ...                              | 6,057           | 27,332              | 5                      | 29                     |\n| Jangal          | ...                              | 7,254           | 59,208              | 8                      |                        |\n\n#### Manure.\n\nIn the description of the use of manure as practised in the district, which was furnished for the Famine Report of 1879 (page 251), it was stated that 53 per cent. of the irrigated land was constantly, and 47 per cent. occasionally manured; while of the unirrigated cultivation only one per cent. of the irrigated area received occasional manure; that some 33 per cent. of the irrigated area grew double crops; and that the quantity of manure used per acre was 100 maunds in the land occasionally, and double that weight in land constantly manured.\n\nAllusion has already been made to the natural supply of manure which the fields just round the site receive by being made the receptacle of the village filth. The litter of the cattle is collected by the cultivators, each having his own heap, in hedged enclosures outside the site. The greater part of the droppings have been carefully removed for fuel, and the refuse consists of byre sweepings. By the commencement of the autumn rains these heaps have attained some dimensions, and the rains assist the decomposition of the mass, which is carted or carried in baskets to the fields intended for maize, spread over them and ploughed in. A top dressing is afterwards given when the maize has sprung up. For the Rabi following a little manure is also ploughed in; but the effect of that used for the maize lasts for the Rabi, as it is not really ready when put on, and some more is spread over the surface when the wheat is two or three inches out of the ground. The winter collections of manure (November to March) all go for the sugarcane; and they are generally in very fair condition, having been rotting for four or five months, and exposed to the rain. Top dressings are also added till the cane is about three feet high. This description will apply to irrigated and to defasli B\u00e9t lands alike. Unirrigated lands in the Dh\u00e1ia never get manure, as they are much too dry to stand it. The western Jagraon and Jangal villages have a magnificent supply, which is at present wasted, but will all be used when canal irrigation is introduced. The manure is rather inferior according to our ideas, as the most valuable part has been taken out; but it has a great effect on the soil, and is much valued. It would be impossible to raise cane or two crops in the ni\u00e1ti land without it. The refuse of the city of Ludhi\u00e1na is very fine manure. It is bought up by the\nB\u00e9t villages just under, in which there is some first rate market gardening done in what is really poor soil.\n\nIt will be seen that in the Dh\u00e1\u00eda unirrigated lands there is an established rotation, the Rabi crops, which obtain most of their nourishment from the soil, being followed by the broad-leaved Kharif crops, which draw less on the soil and more on the atmosphere; and the two crops being succeeded by a year's fallow. In the B\u00e9t and other places, where this course is not followed, there cannot be said to be anything resembling a rotation, for there is only one crop to be grown. In irrigated lands there is very little approach to what could be called a regular course, for the crops here too are limited. Still the people very seldom grow their sugarcane in the same field year after year; but prefer, if possible, to have it following cotton. Some fields have undoubtedly been producing maize followed by wheat or barley, for centuries one may say, but the area so treated is limited to the fields touching the site. An ordinary manured field will generally go through such a course as this:\n\n| Year | Rabi | Kharif |\n|------|------|--------|\n| First | Fallow | Cotton |\n| Second | Fallow or fodder crop | Cane |\n| Third | Fallow | Cotton |\n| Fourth | Fallow or fodder crop | Cane |\n| Fifth | Fallow | Maize |\n| Sixth | Wheat | Do |\n\nOutlying fields are not so heavily cropped as this; and those in which maize and wheat are grown do not generally bear cotton and cane. In fact the cultivation of the two sets of crops is kept quite separate on many lands.\n\nThe usual complaints are occasionally heard about exhaustion of the soil; but they are not pressed upon one, and there is little foundation for them. When it is said that the land does not yield so much as it did 200 or 300 years ago in the time of Akbar or before it, there is no reason for dissenting from the proposition. It was then only being brought under cultivation; and there was no necessity for cropping any of it regularly. Thus three out of four kinds of land enumerated in the Ain Akbari (Gladwin's Translation, Volume I, Part III) are fallow; and revenue was only paid for land when cultivated. The waste probably exceeded the cultivated area, and a new piece could always be brought under the plough when a fallow was required. The rates of yield given in the Ain are certainly high; but they are for the whole of India, and are not greater than would result if fallows were given to the land now. Thus the yield of wheat is set down at nine to eighteen maunds a bigah (our standard).\n\nGram ... ... ... 71 to 13\nGur ... ... ... 7\u00bd to 13\nMung ... ... ... 8\u00bd to 6\u00bd\n\nand these are not after all very heavy, taking both irrigated and unirrigated. It was in the nature of things that when cultivation\nhad fully developed, a lower standard of productive power should be reached where manure was not used; but there is nothing to show that within recent times, such as we have information concerning, this standard has decreased. The well lands, we know, will yield according to the amount of manure put on them; and the system of cultivating the unirrigated is in most parts of the district sound, and not likely to cause deterioration.\n\nTable No. XX shows the areas under the principal agricultural staples.

The distribution of the various crops over the district is as follows. Sugarcane is grown in the first twelve or fifteen miles of the B\u00e9t, and in the uplands of Samr\u00e1la tahsil, and of Ludhi\u00e1na, except in the Jangal villages and in the country about Pakhow\u00e1l; but the proportion is higher in Samr\u00e1la, and gradually decreases as we go westwards. There is also very little of it in the sandy tract along the high bank: and none is grown in Jagraon. Cotton is generally grown where cane is, and also further west; but very little in the Jagraon tahsil. The other crops are grown everywhere, except that in the uplands maize and wheat require irrigation, and there is none in the Jangal villages. The autumn unirrigated crops, pulses and fodder, are the same throughout the district; but in the Jangal villages b\u00e1jra sometimes takes the place of jow\u00e1r because it is more hardy. So too wheat mixed with gram is the unirrigated Rabi crop in the eastern parts where the rainfall is heavier: while in the more arid tracts of Jagraon and the outlying villages barley takes the place of wheat. Thus in the east of the district, where the percentage of irrigation from wells is highest, we have a larger proportion of the superior crops, cane, maize, cotton and wheat: while in the western part (Jagraon tahsil) there is not much irrigation, and the greater part of the area is under the rain crops.\n\nSugarcane is grown in an area of 13,213 acres; but its importance is much greater than is indicated by this, for the value of the yield is about ten times that of an ordinary unirrigated crop, and the total annual value some Rs. 12,00,000. It is almost entirely grown for the manufacture of some saccharine product (called k\u00e1tha cane); but in a few villages the ponda or eating variety is raised. K\u00e1tha cane is grown in the unirrigated lands of the Samr\u00e1la B\u00e9t (where it occupies 12 per cent. of the whole area), and of a few Ludhi\u00e1na villages; and at the wells in the uplands of Samr\u00e1la and the eastern portion of Ludhi\u00e1na, the best crop being, perhaps, that raised about Malaudh. It is of three sorts: chan, a soft, juicy cane which grows to a considerable height, has a red colour and long joints (pori); dhaulu does not grow so high, has small joints, and is of a green colour and less juicy; while ghorru is an inferior sort, with many joints and a great deal of leaf at the top, very hard, and yielding much less juice than the others. The first of these is the real cane, and the other two are mere degenerations; no one ever keeps a ghorru stalk for seed; and dhaulu is only planted if there is not enough of chan. The cultivation in the Dh\u00e1\u00eda and B\u00e9t is much of the same description. Cane is sometimes the only crop in a field for two years, especially in outlying ones, where the supply of manure is limited. It may also be grown with the aid of a great deal of manure in land just cleared of another crop of cane, or of a rabi crop of wheat; but, as a rule, it occupies the land for three harvests following a Kharif of cotton. Cane is not grown in the fields next to the site, but generally at a little distance. It is always planted, if possible, in land that has been cropped with\ncotton; and in the Upper Dh\u00e1\u00eda Circle of Samr\u00e1la we find that the area under the two crops is nearly the same. The rotation is generally\u2014\n\n| Year | Rabi | Kharif |\n|------|------|--------|\n| First | Ploughing | Cotton |\n| Second | Feeder, &c. | Ploughing |\n| Third | Ploughing and cane sown | Cane |\n\nand back again to cotton, giving a cane, a cotton and a fodder crop with perhaps a little grain in three years. The cane field is selected next to the well, as the crop has to be kept alive during the hottest months, and always gets more frequent waterings than any other. The land is ploughed not less than seven or eight, and up to 20 times, the more ploughings the better. All the available manure has first been spread over the field, and is ploughed in. The planting is done from the middle of Ph\u00e1g\u00e1n to the middle of Ch\u00e9t (March). The seed consists of joints (pori) cut from last year's crop, which have been kept covered up in pits in the field. In planting them one man goes along with a plough and another follows, laying down the joints at intervals of six or eight inches in the furrow. The plough in making a new furrow covers up the former one; and the whole field is finally rolled. The canes spring from the eyes (\u00e1nkh) of the joint. About four or five canes will come of one joint. Then follow waterings at intervals of seven or eight days in the uplands, and hoeings after each of the first few waterings. The fields are very carefully protected by stout hedges. In the B\u00e9t there are no waterings, and seldom any hoeings: and the fields are quite open. The cane in the uplands grows to a height of eight or ten feet, and when it becomes heavy, is protected by several stalks being tied together. In the B\u00e9t the height is only five or six feet, and this precaution is not necessary.\n\nThere is altogether a great difference in the modes of cultivation, Dh\u00e1\u00eda and B\u00e9t, due principally to the difference of natural conditions, and partly to the different habits of the cultivators, those of the Dh\u00e1\u00eda being industrious Jats, and of the B\u00e9t apathetic Muhammadans, of the Rajp\u00fat and Guj\u00e1r tribes principally. The method of extracting the juice is much the same in both tracts. Cutting goes on all day in the field, each cane being stripped, and the flag at the top with the small joints immediately below it being removed. In the evening the seed joints are separated from the flag (which is then used for fodder or for feeding the boiler furnace) and tied up in bundles for seed. The cane is carted to the belna or mill, which stands just outside the village site. The pressing is done in a belna or mill, the cane being passed in bundles between two horizontal wooden rollers, and the juice running into an earthenware jar set to catch it. In a corner of the enclosure of the mill stands the boiling shed, and the juice is taken into this and boiled in pans. The further processes are noticed below, in Section C. of this chapter. In the Dh\u00e1\u00eda the Jat requires no assistance in the boiling and turns his juice into lumps (bheli) of gur or into shakar, which he may dispose of that very day. In the B\u00e9t the money-lender has invariably advanced money on the crop, and his man does the boiling.\nHere the produce when boiled assumes the semi-liquid form of rab, which is taken in part payment of the debt. Sugarcane is the crop invariably converted into cash, and may be said to be the revenue-paying one. It is very valuable, otherwise it could never have held its own so long, for it occupies the land the better part of two years; and in the Dh\u00e1ia the labour of cultivation is incessant. Bullocks stand the work at the wells and in the belnas for only a few years; and the cultivators are never tired of complaining of their hard life. These objections make it a dangerous crop to any but the most thrifty classes. The Jats keep out of debt because it is in them to do so; but the Muhammadan of the B\u00e9t will tell one that he is a victim of the sugarcane crop, and he is right to some extent, for he has not the qualities which would enable him to subsist while his crop is growing.\n\nPonda sugarcane is now raised in a good many villages under Ludhi\u00e1na. It was formerly confined to two or three Ar\u00e1in villages; but the cultivation has spread. This crop requires a great deal of manure and constant attention; and pigs and jackals are very fond of it. But the canes have a ready sale in the Ludhi\u00e1na b\u00e1z\u00e1r, and the crop is worth at least from Rs. 100 to 150 an acre; and is often bought for that amount as it stands by the green-grocers.\n\nCotton is sown during the months Ch\u00e9t-H\u00e1r (April-June) in fields which have had a Kharif or a Rabi harvest. The best crops are raised in land which has enjoined a fallow in the Rabi (s\u00e1nvee). The yield is better because of the fallow, and also because the sowings are early. It is not usual to have cotton immediately after a Rabi, and where this is done in H\u00e1r the yield is poor. The crop generally follows cane, as explained in the last paragraph. The number of ploughings required is not so great as in the case of cane, and three to four are sufficient. In the Dh\u00e1ia it is grown in the unirrigated lands of a few Samrila villages; but mostly in the well lands, and in dafasli or ni\u00e1\u00ed fields of the B\u00e9t. Where grown at the wells, irrigation is necessary before sowing, unless there have been stray showers of rain in April-June, as there very often are. Two or three hoeings are given. After the autumn rains the waterings are very rare. Pickings commence in October, and go on to the end of November, being eight to ten in number, at intervals of a week. The pickings are done by the women (at all events among the Jats); and the cotton and seed are separated by means of a gin or belna. Of the seed part is kept for sowing, and the rest given to the cattle (var\u00e9wan). It is a favourite food for the well cattle in the cold weather, and for milch kine at all times. Til is often grown with the cotton. It is also very usual to run a plough through the field while the plants are standing and sow barley, carrots, metha, &c., generally for fodder; but there is very often a decent crop of barley caught in this way. A cotton field may have in this way three or four crops in it at one time. There are no varieties of cotton. The usual short stapled sort of the Punjab plains with bushes three or four feet in height is grown everywhere.\n\nMaize is sown at the end of July (from the beginning to the middle of S\u00e1wan) after three or four ploughings with a great deal\nof manure. The best crops are raised in the fields next to the site. It receives the usual number of hoeings (three or four), and springs up very fast, reaching a height of seven or eight feet and growing as well in B\u00e9t, irrigated and unirrigated, as in Dh\u00e1\u00eda land, provided that it gets sufficient manure. The crop ripens in sixty to seventy days, and is reaped at the end of October and beginning of November. There are generally two to four cobs on a stalk. Maize is the best crop of all for the cultivator. It does not require much labour in preparation, and few waterings are necessary if the rains are good. The yield is very great, the value of the crop being next to that of cane, while it has the advantage of a very speedy return. The zam\u00ednd\u00e1r lives on maize for some months, and it is a good, wholesome food. The stalks are also very fair fodder, and last for some time. The ordinary maize of the Dh\u00e1\u00eda has cobs about seven or eight inches in length, with a fair-sized seed of a yellow colour. A species known as bat\u00e1l\u00e1n is grown in the B\u00e9t. It has a shorter cob and a smaller grain, but it is said to ripen in two-and-a-half months to three of the ordinary maize, and for this reason the seed is used by the Dh\u00e1\u00eda people when there has been a break in rains and sowings are late.\n\nWheat is grown in the unirrigated lands of the B\u00e9t and of a few Dh\u00e1\u00eda villages; and at the wells everywhere. It is sown during October and November, as the cultivator has time for it; the unirrigated crops being taken first, so that the moisture be not lost. The unirrigated lands, where not manured, have received a number of ploughings in the cold weather, or rather ought to have, for the ordinary Muhammadan cultivator of the B\u00e9t seldom does his duty to the soil. In the manured lands of the B\u00e9t and the irrigated Dh\u00e1\u00eda the crop follows maize, in which case the preparation consists of two or three ploughings; or if the land has had a fallow, there have been winter ploughings as in the ordinary unirrigated lands. When the crop has sprung it receives in n\u00e1di lands of the Dh\u00e1\u00eda a top dressing of all the manure then available, and several waterings and hoeings. The waterings are at intervals of fifteen days at least. The crop is reaped towards the end of April, or the beginning of May. The grain is eaten or sold; and the straw used as fodder for bullocks.\n\nThe wheat grown everywhere is the bearded red variety common to the Province, and is called kanak or gheo or lal kanak. The grain of the B\u00e9t is said to be better than that of the Dh\u00e1\u00eda (to a native's taste), as the flour is said to be more sticky when moistened and pleasanter in flavour. It appears to be a more moist wheat, like the English. The varieties to which special names are given are uncommon, and only grown in irrigated land. They are:\u2014mundi, a beardless red wheat with a slightly higher stalk and a larger grain than the common kind. The yield is said to be better; but the straw is hard and not good for fodder. The flour is much the same. Dudh-kh\u00e1n\u00ed or dudhi is a white wheat, also beardless, much the same in appearance as the last. The flour is very white, and much used by halw\u00e1\u00ed for making sweetmeats. The straw is said to be hard and poor fodder. Phaman or bad kanak is a very tall variety.\ngrowing to a height of four or five feet in good well land. The grain is large, but said to be hard and not good for flour, and the straw is refused by the cattle. The yield is superior to that of any other sort. It does not appear what foundation there is for the preference for the common wheat, or how much it is due to prejudice; but the use of these varieties is not spreading.\n\nThe cultivation of barley does not differ from that of wheat. There are no recognized varieties, except a sort called k\u00e1buli jau, which is grown in places, and has a whiter grain than ordinary barley. Barley is much hardier than wheat, is sown later and ripens earlier, being in the ground about five months to six of wheat. Wheat cannot be sown later than November, but barley will germinate, and give some yield even when sown as late as the end of December. When the moisture in the soil has dried, and there has been no fall of rain in October and November, the zamind\u00e1r will go on in hope of showers as late even as Christmas; and if there is rain at this time, he will sow late barley (called Kanauji), and get a very poor crop, which gives a yield, perhaps not one-quarter of a good one, but still something to keep him alive. Sowings are occasionally as late as January 10th; and if the subsequent rains are heavy, the yield of grain may be a very decent one, though the stalks are never more than one to one-and-a-half feet high.\n\nGram is not usually sown by itself. It appears to require a good deal of moisture to make it germinate, though the plant is hardy enough afterwards; and it is only in a year of heavy rainfall that a large area is sown with it alone. The people say that the crop depends entirely on the rain of S\u00e1wan, i.e., the earliest monsoon rains, and that if these are scanty, however good the subsequent falls may be, the crop will come to nothing. The sowings commence from the middle of September and go on for two weeks only, as it is useless to sow it after the first week of October. It is reaped, first of all the spring crops, early in April. Gram is not grown in the B\u00e9t, the soil not being suitable.\n\nThe great unirrigated crop of the Dh\u00eda is a mixture of gram with either wheat or barley, sometimes with both, and called berra in all cases. It is sown in October, not later than the end of that month, in land that has had a year\u2019s fallow, and been prepared during the winter by ploughings. The seed is drilled in, and every eighth or tenth drill is sown with sarson or rape. The sarson ripens first, and is cut at the end of March, the rest being ready about April 10th. The reason for sowing two crops together is clearly that both of them are not likely to fail in the same season. The sarson is something over and above the regular crop of the field; and, if a success, gives a handsome return. In some years the wheat or barley is the better crop, and in some the gram; but it must be a very bad year in which both, as well as the sarson fail. The berra is cut and threshed as one crop; and no attempt is made to reap the grains separately. The mixed grain is sold, and people seem to prefer the meal made of it, because it is cheaper than pure wheat, and still has some in it; but it is easy to separate the wheat and gram by means of a channa or iron sieve, which\nallows the wheat grains to pass through, and not the gram. But this is very rarely used as yet. Sarson, besides being grown in the berra fields, is also sometimes cultivated in irrigated patches as a single crop. T\u00e1rdm\u00edra (Brassica eruca) rarely takes its place. The sarson is either made into oil in the village presses, or brought to market and sold in seed. Almost every field of berra yields sarson too; but in our crop returns and produce estimates the land is only shown as under the former, as it is impossible to estimate the areas and yields separately.\n\nThe Kharif pulses are very numerous, the principal ones sown in the Dh\u00e1ia being moth (Phaseolus aconitifolius), mung (P. Mungo), m\u00e1sh (P. Rorburgii) with inferior varieties called munl\u00ed, m\u00e1hri, &c. These are sown sometimes in July in land that has had a rabi crop, and reaped by the end of October. Light sandy soils are well suited to them, and a mixture of one or two of the varieties is the general crop. The yield of grain is seldom very good; but the straw is very strengthening fodder. Except in the lighter soils, which will not bear it, the kharif crop of the uplands is a mixture of the millets and these pulses. The great millet is either sown wide, when the object is to develope the heads for grain (jow\u00e1r) or thick with a view to the fodder (charri). The times of sowing and reaping are the same as for the pulses. Where, as in the eastern portion of the district, there is a great deal of irrigation, and the well cattle are dependent on the fodder raised in the unirrigated land, the crop is always the mixture of moth, &c., with charri, except where the soil is sandy, and only a pulse can be grown. The crop grows up very dense, the millet having a very small head, and never reaching more than a height of about four feet. The people begin cutting the whole as green fodder in August, and go on using it for two months till the crop has ripened. The heads of the charri are occasionally picked for the grain; but generally the mixed crop is cut down and given without any attempt to get the grain of the pulses. It is intended that the cattle should get the grain as well as the straw; for it would be a short-sighted policy to keep out the former, as the cultivator well knows. In Jagran tahsil there is not the same necessity for a strengthening fodder; and very fine jow\u00e1r is grown. There is the same mixture of pulses; but the millet seed is in very small amount, and the stalks come up at intervals and grow to a height often of eight or ten feet, and have very fine heads, which almost weigh them down. The pulses also have a fair yield of grain; and only the straw and jow\u00e1r stalks are used for fodder. In the Jangal villages the spiked millet (b\u00e1jra) sometimes takes the place of jow\u00e1r. In the B\u00e9t charri or fodder alone is grown, the soil not suiting the pulses of the Dh\u00e1ia. There is no yield of grain. M\u00e1sh (called m\u00e1h) takes the place in the B\u00e9t of moth, &c., but it is grown only in the new and moister lands adjoining the river. Mung is also grown alone or mixed with m\u00e1sh; but charri is the sole Kharif crop in the lands of pucka B\u00e9t.\n\nMassar (lentils) have been already mentioned as being sown in newly recovered B\u00e9t land for the first two or three years. The crop is cut for fodder, or the grain is eaten as d\u00e1t. It is only\nin the first year that it is grown by itself, the seed being usually mixed with barley. Barley and massar is the corresponding crop in the B\u00e9t to berra in the Dh\u00e1ia. An occasional field of (alsi) linseed will be found in the B\u00e9t. Rice (munji, dh\u00e1n) is grown in places along the river in completely new land. It is a very coarse sort, and the market price is about 30 seers a rupee. The whole area under it is only 2,500 acres. When a new piece of land turns up, it is ploughed roughly a couple of times, the grass (dib) often being left standing, and the rice sown. There is perhaps no crop at all; but generally a fair yield. There is no transplanting, and the crop ripens in forty days from sowing.\n\nThese are the principal crops, and the remaining ones may be disposed of briefly. San (crotalaria juncea) is grown in the unirrigated lands in sufficient amount to make the necessary ropes for agricultural purposes. It is ready in October, and is cut and steeped in the village ponds, the process causing a most offensive odour. It is then taken out, dried in the sun, the fibres pulled apart and worked by the hand into thin ropes, which are again steeped and then beaten (skuched). These thin ropes are then twisted into others of the necessary thickness. Sankukra (hibiscus cannabinus) is grown round the edges of cane fields sometimes. Indigo is grown in a few Muhamadan villages, principally in the B\u00e9t. The green crop is steeped, and the dye made into balls after the usual native method. Poppies are grown in a few villages for post and a catch crop of kangai or china is occasionally taken at the wells in a bad year when the price of grain is high. Tobacco is grown at the wells in fields which have borne a Khar\u00edf crop. It is sown in plots at the beginning of April, is transplanted in a week or ten days, and is cut in May. It requires a great deal of manure and constant watering. The Muhamadan cultivators of the B\u00e9t (Ar\u00e1n, Guj\u00e1r, &c.) grow a great deal; but there is also some in the Dh\u00e1ia. Melons, Musk (kharb\u00faza), or water (torb\u00faza,) are grown in the B\u00e9t, in unirrigated land. The crop is sown in April, and the melons come into the market in May, and go on through June. There is of course a very large demand for them in the city of Ludhi\u00e1na; and the green-grocers (subsi farosh) buy them from the cultivator by the field, when it is known what the crop is likely to be. The price realized is sometimes very high, and is generally Rs. 20 to 30 an acre. The expense of the manure is considerable; but the crop is a paying one to the cultivator. There is a second crop of water-melons in the Khar\u00edf, sown in July and picked in October-November. Garlic (lassan) and onions (pi\u00e1s) are also grown after the rabi. In the Dh\u00e1ia the cultivator grows a few square yards of the latter for his own consumption; but in the B\u00e9t large fields are grown and sold to the green-grocers. Lassan fetches a high price, and is bought like melons by the field. Pepper (mirch) is also grown in the Ar\u00e1n and Guj\u00e1r villages. All sorts of native vegetables are grown in the wells in the B\u00e9t. They are sonf (joenicum vulgare), dhanid (coriander), potatoes, \u00e1rabi (the edible arum), salgam (turnips), m\u00fali (radishes), ajw\u00e1n, kh\u00edra and kakri (cucumbers).\nThe cotton at the wells is usually followed by a green fodder crop of *metha* (fenugreek), *senji* (trefoil) grown alone or mixed with barley, or by a crop of carrots, which are largely eaten by the people themselves and also given to cattle.\n\nMr. Walker thus discusses the past and future of agriculture in Ludhiana: \"The agriculture which I have described in the preceding paragraphs is of much the same character as it has been for the last century or two. With the increase of population the land has come to be more heavily manured and cropped, but the manner of tilling it has remained unchanged. No new staples have been introduced within recorded memory. The agriculture is, I think, perfectly sound, and it would not be easy to show a Jat how he could do better with the capital at his disposal. A better sugarcane mill may take the place of the present clumsy machine, and improvements may be effected in the form of the plough; but I do not see that much is to be done in the way of introducing new staples or manures. There are some points in which the people might be instructed; but there are not many in the present system which could be pointed out as really faulty. A Jat would willingly adopt any real improvement within his means, as he is not prejudiced. For the ordinary cultivator of the Bet one has only to set up his neighbour, the Arain or the Hindu Jat of the Dharia, as an example of what he might do.\"\n\nTable No. XXI shows the estimated average yield in pounds per acre of each of the principal staples as shown in the Administration Report of 1881-82. The following tables give the estimates framed by the Settlement Officer for the purposes of the revised assessment.\n\n| Grain       | Agriculturalists | Non-agriculturalists | Total |\n|-------------|------------------|----------------------|-------|\n| Wheat       | 615,705          | 414,731              | 1,030,236 |\n| Inferior Grains | 1,291,010      | 809,503              | 2,090,513 |\n| Pulses      | 889,062          | 640,960              | 1,530,022 |\n| **Total**   | **3,735,877**    | **1,835,254**        | **5,571,131** |\n\nThe average consumption of food per head has already been noticed at page 54. The total consumption of food grains by the population of the district as estimated in 1878 for the purposes of the Famine Report is shown in maunds in the margin. The figures are based upon an estimated population of 583,245 souls. On the other hand, the average consumption per head is believed to have been over-estimated. A rough estimate of the total production, exports and imports of food grains was also framed at the same time; and it was stated (page 151, Famine Report) that an annual surplus of some four lakhs of maunds was exported by rail eastwards, consisting chiefly of wheat and gram, with jowar and maize in smaller quantities.\n\nMr. Walker writes as follows:\n\n\"The district is self-feeding, and exports a good deal of food. The superior produce of the eastern half (sugar, cotton, wheat) is nearly all exported; but in place of this there is a large import of inferior grain (*berra* or mixed barley and gram, *jowar*, *moth*, &c.) from the Native States of the south, and our own...\"\n### Ludhiana District\n\n#### CHAP.

There is a very extensive export of these inferior grains from the western half of the district, principally by the railway which passes through it.\n\nOf the calamities to which the agriculture of the district is exposed, the most important is here as in other districts\u2014drought. The history of past famines has already been given in Chapter II (page 36). It will be evident from the general description of the physical conditions of the district, and that given of the agriculture in this chapter, that the effects of a failure of the rainfall on the various tracts are very different. The low-lying B\u0113t suffers little from a mere deficiency of rain, for in the greater part of it, i.e., all above Ludhi\u0101na, the normal rainfall is high (30-27 inches), and the soil is naturally moist. On the other hand, too heavy a fall often injures the crops. The annual floods of the river cover the country to a distance of one or two miles from its regular banks along the whole course of 60 miles; and the percolation reaches much further. Parganah N\u016brpur, which is the lower half of the Ludhi\u0101na B\u0113t, has a considerable proportion of irrigation, while the Jagraon B\u0113t is all under the direct influence of the river. In the uplands of the Samr\u0101la tahsil there is 40 per cent. of irrigation, and in the east of Ludhi\u0101na, 25 to 30, the rainfall varying from 30 to 25 inches. In the southwestern parts of Ludhi\u0101na (about Pakhow\u0101l) and in Jagraon tahsil we have a rainfall decreasing from 25 to less than 20 inches, and the proportion of irrigation 15 in the former, while it is only 8 per cent. in the uplands of Jagraon. Finally in the Jangal detached villages the rainfall is 17 to 15 inches; and there is no irrigation. A failure of the autumn rains affects the whole of the uplands to some extent. In the highly irrigated tracts of the east the well cattle depend on the fodder grown in the unirrigated fields and on the grass; and a deficiency of fodder means that they will be much underfed.\nwhile at the same time they are worked much harder than usual, for the Kharif well crops require more frequent waterings. These Kharif crops are much improved by rain, as well water only reaches the roots; but an average yield is obtained from them in a year of deficient rainfall. When the time for the Rabi sowings arrives, if the rain still holds off, the wells are worked incessantly, and water is taken to all fields within reach, sometimes to very great distances, in order to produce the necessary moisture for the germination of the seed. It is probable that nearly 20 per cent. of the cultivation of tahsil Samr\u0101la can be covered in this way, besides the 40 per cent. regularly irrigated. The supply of water in the wells is of course limited in most villages, particularly in such a season as that in which it would be used for this purpose; but the cultivator is willing to neglect his Kharif to some extent in order to insure a sowing of the unirrigated Rabi. There is likely to be some rain in the winter, and the fields sown will then have a good crop without further assistance. But, if the rain is not sufficient for sowing, a large area of the stiffer soils must always remain uncropped, and the cultivator loses this; while probably one or two of his bullocks give way. He will generally have enough grain in store to put him over the bad season with the aid of what he gets from the land irrigated and unirrigated on which he has raised a crop; and he will sow patches of carrots, ch\u012bni, &c., at his well. Carrots appear to be the great article of food on which the cultivator falls back on such occasions wherever wells work, and the praises of the vegetable are celebrated in the popular rhyme:\n\nGaj\u0101s\u0101 gajr\u0101l\u012b; ch\u0101ja parbh\u0101t dh\u0101r\u012b;\nB\u0101nh\u0101n, tang\u0101n sukhi\u0101; kite tid us\u0101re.\n\nA bad season, i.e., the failure, total or partial, of two harvests\u2014for the Rabi will never be much if the Kharif is bad\u2014may or may not leave the cultivator in the money-lenders' books for the price of a bullock or for some grain, this depending on the state of his pocket and the amount of grain he had to start with. A second bad year, one in which the fodder dried up, and the wells had to be used for sowing the Rabi, would be likely very seriously to cripple the resources of the whole population, and involve them in debt to a large extent. Such was the calamitous famine of 1783 A.D., but the conditions are much altered since then owing to increase of irrigation; and such an event is not likely to occur even once in a century. In the western parts a failure of the autumn rain means the loss of both harvests over a large area of unirrigated land, although the wells can be used for sowing the Rabi here also, and some villages on the Ferozepore border have wells which are used to a very limited extent in ordinary years, having been sunk as something to fall back on in a year of drought. But the whole area so protected is limited, and the loss of the fodder crops would be followed by a great mortality amongst the cattle. In 1860 and 1868, the last occasions on which there has been anything resembling a drought, the people from the Jangal began in August and September to swarm over the country in search of straw and other fodder. As the drought continued, every one wanted to dispose of at least some of his cattle, and the price fell, till a good\nbullock would not fetch a few rupees. Then the cattle began to be turned out ownerless, and died all over the country. But the people themselves were well off. Mr. Walker writes: \"Most families will be found to have in store at any time the grain of two Rabi harvests; and many of three or more, especially if the seasons have been good everywhere and prices low. The Jats watch the market very keenly, and sell what they calculate they can spare at the most favourable time. What suits the villagers of these western parts best is to have good harvests here, a famine somewhere else, and the consequent high prices. Such was the combination in 1877-78, when famine prices followed very fair harvests throughout the district, owing to the drain towards the Deccan. But, even if the season has been a bad one in the district, most land-owners will be found to profit by famine prices, provided of course that the stocks have not been depleted in previous years; and I doubt if they ever will be again unless by two bad seasons in succession and the failure of all four harvests. The immense profits made by the sale of grain in the three years\u20141860, 1868 and 1877\u2014has greatly encouraged the storing of it; and I believe that another year of famine prices would find the stocks in the houses of the agriculturists much larger than they have ever been before. If the succeeding year is a good one, the cultivator has probably more than recouped his losses by the profits on the sale of his grain, and can purchase cattle to make up for what has perished. But in all probability he had more to start with than were actually required for his simple agriculture, and can go on for a year or two with a reduced number. A second bad season would of course do injury more or less according as the failure of crop was total or partial. There would be a further and more general loss of cattle; and the cultivator would have to keep all his grain for his own consumption. There has, happily, been no such combination under our rule as the complete failure of four harvests in succession; and, as within the next two or three years, the distributaries of the Abohar and Bhatinda branches of the Canal will have brought the means of irrigation within the reach of every village that requires it in Jagraon and in the south and west of Ludhiana, we may say that its occurrence has now been rendered impossible. When the irrigation from the Canal has been fully developed, there will be no part of the uplands with less than 25 or 30 per cent. of its area protected.\"\n\nSome of the minor calamities of season and of the pests from which the crops suffer, are noted below:\n\nAgast\n\nAgast or Agat is a north wind which blows for a day or two about Bhadon 22nd (middle of September), and breaks the maize stalks, besides injuring in a less degree the cane and cotton. The name is that of a demon who is supposed to cross the country on his way from the hills to Ceylon, and to spread ruin amongst the crops in his course, which is generally only a few miles wide. His advent is followed by the appearance of the bird called mamola (wagtail); and is really the beginning of the cold weather. Witness the couplet:\u2014\n\"Bhadon! by your 22nd day Agat sets out for Lanka; the streams and water become controlled; the butter hardens.\"\n\nFrost does a good deal of harm (p\u00e1la m\u00e1rlia is the expression used) to the cane and to the late cotton (sometimes), as well as to the sarson in the Rabi. It does not appear to affect the wheat and gram; but the wheat and barley, when the grains are forming in the heads, are very liable to be blighted by cold winds from the north or west, the east winds are always mild. This is called bulla m\u00e1rlia; and the people have no very clear account to give of what happens. They say that they find some morning that the grain is blighted, and the heads turn yellow and wither. Hail storms (gold, galla) occur almost annually somewhere or other in the district, either in the month of October or in March. The Kharif or part of it is generally reaped at the time that the autumn storms come; but considerable injury is sometimes done to the pulses. The Rabi always suffers severely from hail when it falls, the wheat and barley stalks being snapped, and the gram pods broken off. In a few days the crop gets a yellow withered appearance. A hail-storm generally passes across some part of the district to a width of one or two miles, but the total injury done is never very considerable, only a few fields in any village being affected as a rule. Lightning does occasional injury to fields of cotton pulses and sam in the autumn. Locusts (ahn, lid) appear at places every third or fourth year, and go across some of the villages in a line two or three miles wide, eating up everything. Their appearance is generally in September-October (Bhadon-Assoj). Their ravages have never been so extensive as to cause a general calamity; and the injury is usually partial, like that of hail-storms. They have not appeared now (1883) for five or six years. Sondi are green caterpillars which attack the gram and sarson stalks. Good rains in the cold weather will kill them; but if the rains are short, they are most destructive to unirrigated crops; much worse than locusts, because they are universal and come every year. They live in holes, and come out during the night to work. Hard soils suffer most. And in places at least half of the gram crop is sometimes eaten by them. Kungi, or red rust, is said by the natives to be caused by a tiny insect that appears on the wheat or barley heads when rain is followed by clouds. It affects the crops in M\u00e1gh-Ch\u00e9t when the ears are beginning to form, and covers them with a fine dust, yellow or red, under which the grain shrivels. General injury is done by kungi at rare intervals, the last bad year for it having been 1875. It often appears, but a few days of sunshine drive it away. Kungi affects irrigated as well as unirrigated crops. Young cane plants are attacked by a caterpillar called kansua and full grown cane by small insects called t\u00e9la (black) and punte (white). T\u00e9la also attacks cotton. Cane and cotton are cleared of these by rain, otherwise the juice of the cane becomes watery and poor. White ants (seonk) attack the roots of the unirrigated Rabi crops in all soils, and do a great deal of injury in some years. The cure for them, as for all other pests, is rain.\nField rats also do some harm in light soil, but have never come to be much of a pest. Sondi caterpillars and white ants do much more injury than anything else to the unirrigated crops. Jackals eat the maize all over the district, and the destruction caused by pigs in the villages under Ludhi\u00e1na has been noticed in Chapter I (page 18). Herds of deer wander all over the fields, but they are not so numerous as to cause much injury. People put up in places sticks with cloth attached to scare the deer off (called darne). Platforms (manna) are erected on the trees or on sticks stuck in the ground for the purpose of watching the maize and jow\u00e1r fields, and boys sit on these screaming and firing mud pellets from slings (gopia). A rude fiddle made of half a gourd, with a piece of gut stretched across it, is used in the B\u00e9t for frightening the pigs from the cane. The noise may be heard at a great distance. The cultivators also light fires along their fields for the same purpose, and have to watch all night. In most villages a r\u0101khi or watchman is appointed, whose duty it is to wander about the fields and see that cattle do not stray amongst the crops. If cattle are caught trespassing, the owner is fined a couple of seers of grain, which is paid to the watcher, who also receives an allowance from the whole village at harvest time. Watching at night is not usual, except where, in places, the habit of pilfering from the fields has become common, or in the neighbourhood of H\u0101rni villages, or of the towns.\n\nThe subject of arboriculture has already been noticed in describing the flora of the district (page 9). The roads under district management have good avenues of shisham, sir\u012b, and kikar, &c., and the Grand Trunk Road is also lined with trees in places. There are two plantations under the Forest Department; but the absence of waste lands puts out of the question any project of raising them in village areas. There is quite as much wood grown as the people require for ordinary purposes.\n\nThe following note on the forests of the district has been kindly furnished by the Forest Department: \"The Ludhi\u00e1na plantation reserve consists of a long narrow strip of 197 acres, was commenced in 1867-68, and is composed entirely of shisham. It is situated on the Grand Trunk Road, midway between the left bank of Sutlej and Ludhi\u00e1na. The produce has been sold to and cut and removed by the Sindh, Punjab and Delhi Railway for the supply of material for the Sutlej river training works. Reproduction is progressing favourably by coppicing. The soil is good sail\u0101ba, and subject to annual inundations by the Sutlej.\"\n\nSECTION B.\u2014LIVESTOCK.\n\nFrom what has been written in Chapter I as to the absence of grazing ground, it may be inferred that the district is not adapted for cattle-breeding. Some figures on the subject will be\nfound in Table No. XXII. The District Returns of Livestock for 1882 show the following details:\n\n- Cows, bullocks and buffaloes: 270,338\n- Horses and ponies: 1,815\n- Donkeys: 7,430\n- Sheep and goats: 68,505\n- Camels: 1,611\n\nAn enumeration was made by the patw\u0101ris in 1879, which gave the following results:\n\n- Draught cattle (buffaloes and bullocks): 137,665\n- Milch kine: 108,851\n- Young stock: 96,983\n- Horses and ponies: 3,155\n- Sheep and goats: 50,408\n- Camels: 1,849\n\nMr. Walker writes of this enumeration: \"The cattle in the towns did not come into our enumeration; and for these we ought to add about 18,000 to the milch kine and a good deal to the sheep and goats. I fear that I cannot claim very great accuracy for our figures; but they are probably not far out. The district returns are an estimate by the tahsild\u0101rs.\" During 1879-80 the district supplied to the Transport Department 3,500 camels, besides some mules and ponies. Many of these doubtless came from across the border.\n\nBullocks are universally used for agricultural work; and he must be a very poor man who can only afford a buffalo, this animal being considered the sign of poverty in a cultivator. The bullocks are either bred in the villages, or imported from the cattle-breeding tracts to the south, (Hansi, &c.), being brought up in droves by dealers who go from village to village, generally a few weeks before the Bais\u0101khi and Diw\u0101li fairs, on their way to Amritsar. There are no cattle fairs in this district. It is difficult to determine exactly what proportion of the cattle used in agriculture are bred in the district; but it is probable that between three-fourths and half of those in Samr\u0101la are imported. In Jagraon there is still some grazing land left, and the greater part of the cattle in use are probably bred in the tahsil; but there are also large purchases from dealers. The people of the Jangal are very fond of buying cattle, using them for the few months during which agricultural operations go on, and then selling them, thus saving the keep for several months. The home-bred cattle are said to be better for the work than those imported, because, apparently, the former are stall-fed all their lives, while the latter, having been raised on grazing, feel the change, and cannot do well on the straw which they have to eat for a great part of the year. A bullock costs from Rs. 20 to 25, if two years old; and Rs. 40 to 60, if of full working age. At two years old he is yoked in the plough; and works in this till he is four, when he is put to the well. Bullocks go on working till twelve; but at that age they are old, and they do not live beyond fourteen or fifteen. In Samr\u0101la and the highly cultivated parts of Ludhiana they do not last so long, on account of the constant hard work in the sugarcane mills and at the wells. Where (as in Jagraon) the people keep\nChapter IV. B.\n\nLivestock.\n\nIn the months of Baisakh, J\u00e9t, Har (April-June) the cattle are fed on dry straw and grain, the new straw of the Rabi coming in by the first of these months. This is the worst time for them, and the working cattle could not get on without the seer or two seers of grain that they get daily. In Sawan and Bhadon there is good grass in the waste, if any is left, and in the fields intended for the next Rabi, where it is allowed to grow till the time of the Sawan ploughing. The cattle are grazed on this, and it is also grubbed up and given to them in the stall, the grain being stopped. Cutting grass is the work, in Jat villages, of the women, who are out all day in the fields, collecting bundles. The cattle have very light work in these two months, because the wells are not working; and between this and the new grass they put on condition. In Assoj and half of Katak (September to October) green fodder, either charri alone or mixed with moth, &c., is given; and this is perhaps the best time of the whole year for the cattle. At the end of Katak the charri, &c., is cut and stored, and during Magar, Poh, Magh, and Phagan the dry stalks of charri, maize, &c., are given, and, if necessary, straw. The straw is either white (safed bhusa), that of barley and wheat, or misa, i.e., of moth, makh, &c., coloured straw. The latter, especially the moth straw, is said to be very strengthening. In the month of Ch\u00e9t (March) patches of green fodder are grown at the wells, either methu, senji, &c., or carrots; and green wheat or barley is also given, but not commonly in an ordinary year.\n\nMilch kine.\n\nThe number of milch cattle is not more than sufficient to supply local wants. There is no attempt to keep cows specially for the sale of milk or of ghi except in a few Gujar villages mostly close under Ludhiana; and in these the milk is generally bought up by people from the city. Our enumeration would show a cow to every five or six of the population. In the Bet buffaloes and cows are generally kept; and in the Dhaia cows. The milk is boiled and churned in the usual manner in a chatti of earthenware by means of a wooden staff (madhani) twirled round in the hands or by a string. The people of the house use the butter-milk (lassi) which forms a very important part of the cultivator's daily food; but the ghi is generally sold or kept for the occasion of a marriage, &c. The whole supply is not, however, more than sufficient for the consumption of the better classes in the villages and in the towns.\n\nLoss of cattle by disease: Insufficient food: Drought.\n\nA good deal of loss is caused annually by cattle disease, and attempts are being made to disseminate information on the subject. The names given by the people are so various, and their accounts of the causes often so fanciful, that it is not easy to identify the different diseases that prevail. Great mortality occurs from overwork and insufficient food, especially in a year of drought. In the eastern parts of the district nearly the whole of the Kharif unirrigated\ncrop is grown for fodder; and a failure of the autumn rains means that the cattle will get no grass or green charri in the autumn; and no dry charri in the months of the cold weather; while they are at the same time deprived of their usual rest of two or three months, and have constant work at the wells. It is not possible that cattle should go all the year round on dry straw and grain. The first effect of drought is to reduce the condition of the cattle, and to render them very liable to the ordinary ailments if they do not actually die of overwork and starvation. There was a considerable loss in this way in 1861 and 1868, but not in any other year since the Regular Settlement. Besides being sadly overworked and often insufficiently fed, the cattle in the eastern villages are very badly housed. They are taken home inside the village, and penned up in houses a few feet square, while their masters are enjoying the fresh air on the roof of the house. In the western parts they have much better accommodation, and get plenty of fresh air.\n\nSirak and bawra are terms used to denote any form of epidemic disease; also marri. Only two true epidemic diseases amongst cattle can be identified, of which the first appears to be either anthrax fever or malignant sorethroat. It is called gal gotu, and is very deadly in its effects, and also most infectious, attacking buffaloes and bullocks alike. The affected beast gives up its food, and a swelling forms in the throat. This appears to burst internally, and the majority of animals affected die the day after the appearance of the first symptoms. No attempt is made at a cure; but it is said that, if purging sets in the second day, the animal will recover, unless it dies of exhaustion in ten or fifteen days. The disease is always present somewhere in the district, and when a village becomes infected, it will lose fifty to a hundred cattle in a few days. Recoveries are rare. No attempt is ever made to prevent the spread of the disease by isolation, burying carcases, &c. It is said to be carried from one village to another by carrion-eating birds, storks in particular.\n\nFoot and mouth disease is called monkhar or morkhur (also rora and chapla), and is common. It is never very deadly; but the cattle affected are useless for a long time. It appears to be very infectious, and crops up here and there almost every year. The first object to which attention should be directed is obviously the prevention of the spread of these epidemics from village to village and inside of villages; and it will, of course, be very difficult to induce the people to do anything for themselves in the matter.\n\nOf the ordinary ailments, ogu appears to be epilepsy, or paralysis, the beast affected generally falling down and dying in a short time. Tilla and hallu are the effect of cold, and attack buffaloes only, the symptom being difficulty of respiration. Mokh is purging in any disease. Rinderpest does not appear to be amongst the diseases which attack the cattle of the district. Cattle are often lost by overfeeding with methe or other green fodder after having had poor food for some months. When there is a break in the rains, and the charri is stunted (called sokha), cattle getting into the field and grazing fall down and die. This is called patha lag gya, and is apparently choking.\nThe people of the Dh\u00e1ia are not fond of keeping horses, considering them a useless expense. The distances are generally short, and the people prefer walking. Of the lambard\u00e1s even it is only one in a hundred who owns any sort of an animal, or has ever been on one. Our enumeration shows about three horses or ponies to each village. In the B\u00e9t, where there is a little grazing, the Muhammadans have a few weedy ponies, but these are of a very poor breed. In the villages to the south-west of the Jagraon tahsil (M\u00e1noke, &c.) there appears to be something like a better breed of horses, but these belong to the better classes, and there are after all very few of them. Government stallions are kept at Ludhi\u00e1na and at Jagraon. In one or two of the villages to the south-west of Ludhi\u00e1na the proprietors are engaged in the horse trade (Burj Latan, Alik\u00e9, Dhingar, &c.). They buy young animals all over the country, feed them up for two years, and sell them at Batesar and other fairs across the Jamna. This trade is not of any importance.\n\nA portion of this district, as well as of the districts of Ferozepore and Sirsa, abuts on a tract of country extending about 50 miles all round the Pati\u00e1la fort of Bhatinda, which is called the Jangal, and the horse of which tract is well known as the Jangal horse, the breed being descended from Arab stallions kept at Bhatinda by the Muhammadan Emperors. Pati\u00e1la still keeps stallions there but of inferior quality. The mares of the Jagraon tahsil, which abuts on this tract, are of a very fine breed; and in 1877 the Punjab Government gave at first two and eventually four horse stallions and three donkey stallions, of which one horse and one donkey are kept at the Jagraon tahsil, and the rest at the Sadr. Of the four horse stallions two are imported English and two are Stud bred from Arab stock; of the three donkey stallions one is of French, one Persian and one Arab breed. There are 166 branded mares for the horse stallions, and 134 for mule-breeding. There is a Sal\u00fatri zillad\u00e1r who has gelded 78 colts: 51 colts descended from this stock have been purchased by dealers. The system has been at work five years, and bids promise to become a great success. There are no horse fairs held in the district, and a proposition is under consideration for establishing a horse and cattle fair at Ludhi\u00e1na. The owners of stock are showing a tendency to comply with the instructions of the Horse-breeding Superintendent as regards the rearing of colts; and, as above noted, the custom of gelding the colts is making most satisfactory progress.\n\nCamels are kept by the people of most of the Jangal villages, and by those of a good many others scattered over the district where it has become the custom to do so. It is very common for an enterprising zam\u00ednd\u00e1r to purchase two or three camels with any savings that he has, and to start in the carrying trade. The Jats are very fond of turning an honest penny in this way; and where carts will not work, as in the Jangal villages, camels are used for bringing up the grain to market. The K\u00e1b\u00fal campaign of 1878 is said to have nearly cleared the district out of camels. Mr. Walker writes: \"I know of one large village in the Jangal in which there were formerly a good many; but when I visited it in 1880 there was not a single one left; and, what was worse...\"\nthe people said they did not intend to keep any more. Since then compensation has been paid; but I doubt if confidence has been restored, and I am afraid that, if Government should again have need of camels, it will not get many from this district. Compensation to be effective ought to follow immediately after a loss, for the ordinary rate of interest or profit that a zamindar expects is 25 per cent. per annum.\n\nSheep and goats are returned as sixty to seventy thousand in number. They are kept in every village, the goats for their milk and the sheep for their wool. They belong to no special class of the community, and require no separate mention here. Donkeys and mules are used by Kumhars or brick-makers. There are very few pigs. Fowls are not to be found, except in Muhammadan villages, and there they belong to low caste people, generally Chuhras. There are ducks and geese in many villages along the Budha, and a large number are reared in the old Chaoni or former military bazar. These find their way to Kasauli and Simla, and there is rather a busy trade in them.\n\nSECTION C.\u2014OCCUPATIONS, INDUSTRIES AND COMMERCE.\n\nTable No. XXIII shows the principal occupations followed by males of over 15 years of age as returned at the Census of 1881. But the figures are perhaps the least satisfactory of all the Census statistics, for reasons explained in the Census Report; and they must be taken subject to limitations which are given in some detail in Part II, Chapter VIII of the same Report. The figures in Table No. XXIII refer only to the population of 15 years of age and over. The figures in the margin show the distribution of the whole population into agricultural and non-agricultural, calculated on the assumption that the number of women and children dependent upon each male of over 15 years of age is the same, whatever his occupation. These figures, however, include as agricultural only such part of the population as are agriculturists pure and simple; and exclude not only the considerable number who combine agriculture with other occupations, but also the much larger number who depend in great measure for their livelihood upon the yield of agricultural operations. More detailed figures for the occupations of both males and females will be found in the Census Report of 1881. The figures for female occupations, however, are exceedingly incomplete.\n\nTable No. XXIV gives statistics of the manufactures of the district as they stood in 1881-82. Of the number of \"private looms or small works\" there shown, the following are in the town of Ludhiana: Cotton 400, wool 500, other fibres 85, wood 200, iron 50, brass 23, building 600, dyeing, &c., 80, leather 200, pottery, &c., 50, oil 200, pashminah 900, carpets 2, jewelry 100, other\nmanufactures 300. The greater part of the entries refer to village weavers and artizans. The manufactures of Ludhi\u00e1na city will be described in Chapter VI (page 218).\n\nThe rural population of the district is not engaged in any particular manufacture or industry. The menial classes and artizans of the villages make sufficient clothes, shoes, earthen dishes, &c., for the use of the cultivators. Weaving is always done for wages, the wool or cotton being supplied to the weaver, who gets paid for his work. Coarse cloth (khaddar, &c.,) sometimes finds its way into Ludhi\u00e1na from the villages, but there may be said to be no separate weaving industry out of the city. In a few villages local artizans have established a reputation for some special manufacture, such as Lalton and Sahna, for dishes of brass and k\u00e1nsi ware; Rah\u00e1wan, for locks and other iron-work, and also for stamping clothes; Samr\u00e1la and Dherru, for iron-work. The towns of Machiw\u00e1r\u00e1 and Bahlolpur are famous for their s\u00fasi cloth, and the former also for its jewelry.\n\nThe principal manufactures for export are the gur and shakar (raw sugar) made by the cultivators everywhere in the Dh\u00e1\u00eda from the sugarcane; the khand or b\u00fbra (refined) made at Machiw\u00e1r\u00e1 and in its neighbourhood, and the cloths of Ludhi\u00e1na. An account of the manner in which the cane juice is boiled into gur or r\u00e1b have already been given in Section A of this Chapter (page 136); and further details will be found in the extract given below from the Settlement Report. There are about 70 khanch\u00eds in Machiw\u00e1r\u00e1, and 30 more scattered over the B\u00e9t belonging mostly to Khatris, but also to B\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1s, S\u00fads and even Jats. The outturn of each press is estimated at upwards of Rs. 2,000 value in sugar (b\u00fbra, khand) and treacle (s\u00edrah); and in a good year for the trade, when sugar is dear, the contents of a khanchi may be worth Rs. 3,000.\n\nMr. Walker describes the process of manufacture as follows in an appendix to his Settlement Report: The processes of manufacture employed in the B\u00e9t and in the Dh\u00e1\u00eda or uplands are quite distinct, and an account of the latter will be given first. When the season for pressing approaches (November to March) the belna or mill and other appliances are put in order. The mill used throughout the district is of the sort described in \u201cPunjab Products.\u201d The day before the cultivator\u2019s r\u00e2ri or turn at the mill, the cane is cut and stripped in the field, and the parts reserved for seed set aside. The cane is then carted to the mill in the evening, and next day it is pressed and the juice extracted. Two men sit at opposite sides of the rollers passing through the cane, which is tied up in bundles of 40 or 50 canes each. The juice runs into ch\u00e2tis or jars of earthenware placed beneath the rollers to receive it. As the jars are filled the juice is taken into the boiling-house, and the boiling commences. At one end of the boiling-house there are two pans of iron, about four feet in diameter, placed over a flue heated by a furnace fed from the outside of the building, the fuel being the refuse stalks, heads, &c. The pan nearest the wall is lower than the other, and is fixed, and into this the juice is poured. The second pan is higher and movable. When the juice has\nbeen boiled and evaporated in the lower pan for half an hour, it is lifted with a ladle into the upper pan, which is cooler; and there boils more slowly till it is ready, generally in about an hour. The pan is then lifted off, and the juice stirred till it is cool, when it is poured into a flat dish of earthenware, where it lies to the thickness of about one or two inches. It is, when cool, scraped up with a wooden scraper, and is either granular, in which case it is called shakar, or viscous (gur). If gur, it is made up into balls of about four seers weight. Shakar is put into earthenware jars. It depends entirely on the quality of the juice whether the produce takes the form of shakar or of gur; and this depends again on the soil and the character of the season. In the above process no chemical appliances are used; but in places lime and water are poured into the boiling juice to clean it, the scum being removed. This is generally done where shakar is produced, and has the result, it is said, of giving it a light colour, which is a recommendation. The total number of men employed on pressing and boiling is generally seven: two to drive the bullocks, two to feed the mill, and one to hand the cane to the feeders, one in the boiling house, one to feed the furnace outside. The last is a Cham\u00e1r or menial; but the other six are all of the cultivating class. The Hindu Jats of the Dh\u00e1ia not only make but sell at their own price and when they choose their gur and shakar.\n\nThe state of things in the B\u00e9t, where the population is all Muhammadan, is very different. The process of manufacture there is of two parts: the juice is extracted and boiled at the belna in much the same manner as in the Dh\u00e1ia; but takes the more liquid form of r\u00e1b. Only one pan is placed on the furnace; and, when two jars are filled with juice they are emptied into this through a straining cloth, and the juice, boiled. Water boiled with salhlaie bark is added for the purposes of purifying the juice, and the scum is removed as it rises. The boiling takes about 2\u00bd hours. When the boiling is completed the juice, now in a semi-liquid state and called r\u00e1b, is taken out in a ladle, and put into an open vessel of earthenware till it cools, when it is poured into high jars (matti), the mouths of which are then closed with mud. These jars hold about 3\u00bd to 4 maunds (pucka weight) of r\u00e1b. The boiler, called r\u00e1bi, is always a man of the shop-keeping class, boiling being something of an art. The other men at work are, as in the uplands, cultivators or village menials. But the cultivator has really nothing to do beyond extracting the juice. The second part of the process of manufacture is completely in the hands of the shop-keeper class, the head-quarters of it being in the town of M\u00e1chiw\u00e1r\u00e1, which lies just over the Samr\u00e1la B\u00e9t. The r\u00e1b is taken off in the jars to the shop of the purchaser, in the back room of which, in one of the corners, a space (kh\u00e1nch\u00ed) four or five feet square is walled off to the height of about four or five feet. At the bottom of this, about a foot from the ground, a rough strainer is made of sticks fixed in the walls and running across at intervals, on the top of which are placed reeds and on the top of these a coarse cloth. The sides of the kh\u00e1nch\u00ed are lined with chitai,\nor matting made of river grass. When twenty or thirty jars have been collected the r\u0101b is poured into the kh\u0101nchi and left for twenty or thirty days, during which the sirah or more liquid part drains off into a receptacle. The r\u0101b is then covered with a weed that grows in the water, called j\u0101la put on to the depth of two or three inches (see name at p. 308 of \"Punjab Products\"). This is changed every three or four days for about a fortnight. The effect of this covering and the straining is to clarify the mass; and, as the upper part assumes a light yellowish colour, it is taken off, and the remainder covered up again. The produce thus taken out is put in the sun and trampled. It is then called kh\u0101nd. Another and superior form of produce is b\u016bra, which is thus made. The sirah is strained off as for kh\u0101nd, and the kh\u0101nd is mixed with one-fourth part water and boiled for evaporation in a pan for half an hour. It is then taken off and stirred till cool, when it takes the form of b\u016bra. The sirah or l\u0113t (molasses) is boiled and kept in jars till the rains, when it is treated like r\u0101b, being put into a kh\u0101nchi: or if it is not good enough for this, it is used in its liquid form for sweetmeats, &c. Detailed information regarding the prices and the course of trade will be found in the appendix to the Ludhi\u0101na Settlement Report from which the above extract is taken.\n\nMr. Lockwood Kipling, Principal of the Lahore School of Art, has kindly furnished the following note on some of the special industries of the district, while further information taken from the Settlement Report will be found in Chapter VI (page 218):\n\nThe manufactures of Ludhi\u0101na are similar to those of Amritsar, with the addition of colour-woven cotton goods. The Kashm\u012bri immigrants who are the bulk of the artizans are said to have arrived at Ludhi\u0101na in 1833, when there was a famine in their country.\n\nThe production of fine shawls has now almost ceased. The Franco-Prussian war put a sudden stop to the manufacture of shawls above the value of Rs. 100. Incidentally it converted the populations of Amritsar and Ludhi\u0101na to warm partizanship of France. Crowds of eager listeners used to collect at the railway station where the telegrams from the seat of war were read to them and received with loud expressions of satisfaction or disappointment as the French seemed to gain or lose.\n\nThe decline in the French demand, however, was not the only cause of the falling off, which reduced the number of pashm\u012bnah looms from 1,200 to 300. The Government, and dutifully following its example the Durbars of Native States, no longer take good shawls to be given as khillats. The few shawls that appear on the trays laden with carriage clocks, gold-mounted rifles, musical boxes, epergnes and other knick-knacks presented at Durbars frequently travel back to the toshakhana, and might almost be considered as State theatrical properties. The management of the London sales to which goods are sent from Amritsar and Ludhi\u0101na has been more in the interest of the London buyer than in that of the distant maker.\n\nSyud Ahs\u00e1n Sh\u00e1h, an honorary magistrate and shawl merchant of Ludhi\u0101na, writes that there is \"dishonesty and combination\namong the principal bidders, who purchase the lots at very low prices, and then divide the profits among themselves. A Parsi gentleman, named Hormaji, who was present at the auction in London, says that bigger merchants make a combination and stop all competition from petty traders. They purchase the lots themselves at very low prices, and then sell them to petty traders at a great profit. They also put the balance of their old stock to auction with a view to reduce the market value of fresh goods imported from India, and again purchase them to their advantage. Large stocks of goods for sale and want of competition thus reduce the market value of the goods, and traders are obliged to part with their stocks at a loss. The shawl trade has consequently declined, and out of 300 looms only 200 now turn out superior stuff, the rest manufacture coarse stuff only.\"\n\nFrom this it would appear that \"the knock-out auction\" is not confined to Jew furniture brokers, and the lower ranks of commercial life in London. It must be admitted that the practice of consigning annually large quantities of goods to a limited number of dealers to fetch what may be given invites combination of the kind described by the worthy Magistrate of Ludhiana. The traders on this side are neither strong enough or united enough to combine to establish their own agency in London, nor would they be able to reach the limited and select market now commanded by a ring of dealers. On the part of these latter it is only fair to say that they complain at times of the adulteration of goods professing to be pure pashminah with inferior wool. It is indisputable, however, that, on the whole, the Indian producer gets the worst of it, and it is heartily to be wished that he could find a direct means of reaching the purchasing public in Europe. In some years consignments have turned out more disastrously to the exporters than would be readily believed, and the fact that Indian goods may be sometimes purchased retail in Regent Street at a lower price than any dealer will part with them for in India, is one corroboration of their complaints. The merchant already quoted gives the following average prices of the pashminah goods now made.\n\nRampuri shawls, four yards by two, first quality, Rs. 60 each; second quality of the same size, Rs 15. A shawl three yards by one and a half of good quality is worth Rs. 20, and the smaller size of inferior make Rs. 8. Good woollen stuff, double warp and woof, Rs. 8 to Rs. 20. Jamawars, striped colour-woven fabrics, from Rs. 5 to Rs. 20. Chadar joras used by natives from Rs. 20 to Rs. 50, and Rumals from Rs. 10 to Rs. 50. Syud Ahsan Shah estimates the annual outturn of the Ludhiana manufactures as follows:\n\n| Item          | Quantity | Price |\n|---------------|----------|-------|\n| Rampuri Shawls|          | 70,000|\n| Doshalas      |          | 20,000|\n| Jamawars      |          | 6,000 |\n| Rumals        |          | 1,000 |\n| Small Chadors |          | 1,000 |\n\nIn all about Rs. 1,00,000\n\nThe trade, it will be seen, though it is a comparatively recent one, dating from 1833 only, has undergone some vicissitudes which\nbegan before the Franco-German war with the extinction of the native Government of Oudh. It does not seem likely to receive any great impetus in the future, but the consumption of shawls is so large among the upper classes of natives that it must be long before it dies out altogether.\n\nLudhi\u00e1na excels in lungis and patkas; many of the former are finished with gold lace ends and are worn by native troops. Others are sent to Khorassan and other foreign States. Technically these goods are excellent in colour and texture. A plain patka costs from 12 annas to 5 rupees, and for lungis the prices range still higher. The \"rich colour and close and soft texture\" of the Ludhi\u00e1na lungis were noticed by the Jury at the Punjab Exhibition.\n\nAnother class of cotton goods is a sort of check or kh\u00e9s, but in a different style of stripe or check from the ordinary product and known as gamr\u00fan. These are woven in pieces twenty yards long and nearly three-quarters of a yard wide, and are very well suited for summer wear. The weaving is smooth and even, and English and American cotton yarns are worked up. The annual average sale of the cotton goods enumerated amounts to about Rs. 2,00,000 and it is said by some to be increasing. The gamr\u00fans scarcely seem to be as well known among European residents in the Punjab as they deserve to be. The Basel Mission at Mangalore and other works in distant parts of the country are indented upon for goods which could be equally well supplied from Ludhi\u00e1na.\n\nSilk-weaving is not here of much commercial importance, but lungis and other articles are made at least as well as at Amritsar.\n\nThough there is no great speciality for metalware at Ludhi\u00e1na, the specimens sent to the Punjab Exhibition showed a quite average excellence. A local smith turns out a very fairly finished match-lock for Rs. 20.\n\nSome small objects carved in ivory were sent to the Lahore Exhibition, but there does not seem to be any regular production.\n\nSince the time when a Mission Press was set up in the Danish settlement of Serampore and became important in both its commercial and educational results, the printing press has been a favourite instrument in the hands of Christian missionaries. The Ludhi\u00e1na mission printing and book-binding establishment turns out work of unusual excellence and finish. The vernacular type and Roman-Urdu books printed here, as well as the book-binding, received high commendation at the Punjab Exhibition of 1881-82. The Ludhi\u00e1na mission press does not advertise largely, like the Methodist Episcopal press of Lucknow, and it has not produced so popular a book as the cheap Roman-Urdu Dictionary of that establishment which is sold extensively in the Punjab; confining itself apparently to work of a more strictly religious character. But it takes a high place for good workmanship and neatness.\n\nThere are no statistics available for the general trade of the district, but Table No. XXV gives particulars of the river traffic that passes through the district. The exports and imports of food-grains have already been noticed. It is not easy to\ndescribe the trade of the district apart from that of the country about; but the course that it takes is roughly as follows. The surplus produce of the western villages, consisting of gram (alone or mixed with barley or wheat), and the autumn millets and pulses, is brought up to the line of railway for export from the district, or finds its way into the eastern villages for consumption there. Very little of the gur produced in the eastern parts is consumed in them; and most of it is bought up on the spot by trading Jats from the Jangal or M\u00e1lwah country, and taken away in carts or on camels, none of it going by rail. There is no demand for gur from the direction either of Lahore or of Calcutta, as those parts have their own supply. The sugar (b\u00fara and khand) of M\u00e1chiw\u00e1ra and its neighbourhood is bought up on the spot in the same way as the gur, or is brought to the railway at Ludhi\u00e1na, and finds its way northward, as it is not made beyond the Bi\u00e1s, and is in great demand with the sweetmeat-makers of Amritsar, Lahore, Mooltan, &c. There is a very considerable import of sugar, both gur and khand, from the Jullundur Do\u00e1b also, especially into the Jagraon tahsil from the neighbourhood of Nakodar. Most of the cotton of the eastern parts is exported, but does not generally take the railway on account of bad packing and consequent high rates of carriage. It is either taken back by the trading Jats in their carts, or carried by merchants in hired ones to Ferozepore, whence it goes down the Sutlej in boats. There is also an export of wheat from the eastern villages, the cultivators living on the inferior grains, some of which (maize, mass\u00e1r, &c.) are produced in the tahsil; but there is also a considerable import of gram, pulses, &c., from the west to supply the place of the wheat. The principal imports into the district are English piece-goods and iron from the south, and salt from the north. These come first to Ludhi\u00e1na and thence find their way over the country to the south and west of the railway. There is also an import trade in brass dishes. The pashm trade will be referred to in the notice of the town of Ludhi\u00e1na (page 218).\n\nThe trade from the west is entirely in the hands of the Jats, who bring the grain in their own carts, and dispose of it themselves either at Ludhi\u00e1na to the regular grain merchants, or in the villages. A Jat would not part with his grain on the spot, even if it were the custom for the merchants to go about the country, for he expects to get a better price at Ludhi\u00e1na, and his cattle would be idle if he did not employ them in carrying. The return trade of sugar, cotton, &c., is carried by the carts that bring the grain, and these seldom go back empty; and in such transactions the regular merchant has no share at all. It has already been explained that the Jats of the unirrigated tracts to the south-west have a great deal of spare time, which they devote to trade; but that those of the east are tied down to their villages. Nearly all the gur and shakar sold in the district is bought up by the trading Jats from the cultivators. The trade in the finer sugar products (khand and bura) made in M\u00e1chiw\u00e1ra and its neighbourhood is entirely in the hands of the mercantile classes. A cultivator from Samr\u00f3l\u00e1 tahsil may make an expedition for three or four days with\nhis cart in search of grain when prices rise; but he cannot get far, as his crops would suffer. The cotton is either sold to some Jat who visits the village, or is bought up by the petty local traders who keep it till the regular dealers come round, as they generally do to the larger towns and villages once a year. The grain on coming to Ludhi\u00e1na is purchased from the Jats by the regular grain merchants, mostly men who have come as representatives of firms in Delhi, Muzaffarnagar, Mirat, Sah\u00e1rampur, &c. There is also a considerable proportion of residents engaged in the trade.\n\nIt is impossible to give any accurate estimate of the extent of trade of this district. The Ludhi\u00e1na railway station is the centre of trade for a very large tract of country, embracing most of the Ferozepore district, and a great part of the territory of the Protected States; and any attempt to determine how much of the grain trade coming along the Ferozepore and Kotla roads belonged to this district would be mere guess work. The cotton from the east also for the most part comes from Umballa district, the centres of the trade being Kor\u00e1li and Morinda; but Samrila tahsil contributes something. The number of carts coming in this direction is never very large, the busy time being February and March. On the other hand, the press of traffic on the Ferozepore road is sometimes tremendous. It is pretty constant, the slack months being July-September, when the bullocks are generally sent out to graze; and the busiest, May-July, when those who engage in trade in addition to agriculture are all on the road, and the granaries are all open. In May and June the road from D\u00e1kha to Ludhi\u00e1na is one long line of carts. Information is available as to the amount of grain that enters the municipal limits of the town of Ludhi\u00e1na (which embrace the railway station), and also as to the amount that takes the rail at this place; but it is not possible to collect any as to the trade between the Jats of the west and the cultivators of the eastern villages. The carts of the former straggle into the villages in great numbers, the owners sell their grain where they can, and then collect loads of gur, cotton, san, kikar and other wood for rafters, anything that will sell down in their own country. The carts never return empty. In disposing of their grain they may first try Ludhi\u00e1na; and, if not successful there in getting a good price, go on to the villages, and even find their way into the hills sometimes.\n\nSECTION D.\u2014PRICES, WEIGHTS AND MEASURES, AND COMMUNICATIONS.\n\nThe village prices of the chief agricultural staples used for the conversion of produce estimates into money at the Settlement of 1880 are shown below. They are based upon the average prices of the 20 years preceding the assessment. Table No. XXVI gives the retail b\u00e1z\u00e1r prices of commodities for the last twenty years. The wages of labour are shown in Table No. XXVII, and rent-rates in Table No. XXI; but both sets of figures are probably of doubtful value. Further information regarding rents will be found in Section E, Chapter III.\nThe figures of Table No. XXXII give the average values of land in rupees per acre shown in the margin for sale and mortgage; but the quality of land varies so enormously, and the value returned is so often fictitious, that but little reliance can be placed upon the figures.\n\nA simple money wage is paid only in Ludhiana and the other towns. In Ludhiana masons and blacksmiths earn, if paid by the day, Rs. 10 to 12 a month; and carpenters a little more, Rs. 12 to 15. The rates are slightly lower in Jagraon, Raikot, &c. A common coolie is paid 2\u00bd to 3 annas a day (Rs. 5 a month) everywhere. There is usually a good deal of work for coolies, in carrying grain from the sarais and grain markets to the station. This is ordinarily done in hand-carts worked by a few coolies together (reri). In the busy times of the trade four or five annas a day may be earned in this way, the payment being by weight. A number of men of the same class earn their living by grubbing grass in the neighbourhood and selling it in the city. These coolies are of all classes, agriculturists (Jats and Gujars) who have been driven to the work by the scarcity of the land, village menials, Kashmiris of the city, &c. As there are only single looms and no factories, wages for weaving are almost unknown. An apprentice gets his food and Rs. 1 to 2 a month from his master. A weaver will earn not more than two annas to three annas a day, purchasing his own material, and selling the piece when ready.\n\nIn the villages carpenters and masons, if employed by the day, get their food and four or five annas. Labourers at reaping time receive a bundle of crops as their wages; but it is seldom that such men are employed. An account has already been given of the manner in which the village servants are paid by the harvest. A coolie doing any odd job, such as plastering a house, gets his food and one to one and-a-half annas for the day's work. Weavers are given the raw materials, and are paid by the piece.\nThe unit of cloth measure is the *girah*, the width of the first three fingers, sixteen *girahs* going to the *gaz* or yard. In the *gaz* used for pashm\u00ednah there are said to be only $14\\frac{3}{4}$ *girahs*. The *gaz* is two cubits (*h\u00e1th*), i.e., twice the length from the elbow to the points of the fingers.\n\nThe scale for weight is as follows:\n\n- 37 paisa *maundri* = 1 seer *kachcha*.\n- 40 seers *kachcha* = 1 maund *kachcha*.\n\nThe *mans\u00fari paisa* is the old copper coinage of the country. The *kachcha* scale is used everywhere; and the whole of the grain trade is done in it, even in the shops of Ludhi\u00e1na no other being used. The *kachcha* maund is at Ludhi\u00e1na 17 of our standard seers. It varies slightly through the district, this being a remnant of Sikh times, when every ruler had his own weight. A Jagraon maund is about four seers (*kachcha*) less than that of Ludhi\u00e1na; and one of Pakhow\u00e1l something smaller still. Weighing is generally done with a ten-seer (*kachcha*) weight, called *das\u00e9rah*, which has a Government stamp on it. Almost every agriculturist has a weighing balance (*takri*) of his own. A *mop* or earthenware vessel is used in the field for finding out roughly the amount of grain, but in selling the balance and weights are always used. Milk is sold and bought by the seer; but it is generally measured in a *gadwa* or brass vessel of known capacity. Oil is also sold by weight, and it may be said that measures of capacity do not exist.\n\nThe measure of area has been the subject of much inquiry, and of a good deal of correspondence. Mr. Walker thus discusses the subject: \"The Emperor Akbar fixed one standard *b\u00edghah* for the whole empire, viz., a square of which each side was a chain. The chain was 20 *ghattas*, each *ghatta* being $3 \\text{ Id\u00e1hi gaz}$. Thus $3 \\text{ Id\u00e1hi gaz} = 1 \\text{ ghatta}, 20 \\text{ ghattas} = 1 \\text{ chain}$. The *ghatta* I do not find mentioned in the Ain Akbari, and I could not before account for it. The *Id\u00e1hi gaz* was Akbar's standard of linear measurement, and is somewhat less than ours, so that the *ghatta* is $2\\frac{1}{2}$ of our yard. The Sikhs introduced their own land measures, of which mention will be made hereafter. The imperial *b\u00edghah* was restored as the official standard in our settlement of the villages acquired in 1835, and in the whole district in 1850; but the people have not adopted it. They know it very well, but they say that it bears a certain relation to the local measure. There is no connection between *gaz* or *ghatta* on which it is built, and the pace on which the people always fall back. The ancient measures of the country are the *ghum\u00e1o* and the *kachcha b\u00edghah*. The latter is the standard of Hindustan or the Cis-Sutlej country; and the former appears to be in use all over the Punjab proper, and it has also partly spread in the M\u00e1lwah. In the uplands of this district the *ghum\u00e1o* is used in the greater part of Jagraon and in the Jangal villages, and the *b\u00edghah* in the rest. In the B\u00e9t the *ghum\u00e1o* prevails, except in a small piece of country about Matew\u00e1rah. The B\u00e9t tract was all in the Jullundur Do\u00e1b at one time, and brought the Punjab measure with it when the river changed its course, the exception\nmentioned above being caused by Sudha Singh introducing the use of the bigah in the new villages which he founded, so as to have one standard for the whole of his territory. It was not in the power of the rulers to make the people adopt a new measure; but they could fix the standard of that measure.\n\n\"The scale of the ghum\u00e1o is as follows:\n\n3 Karams double paces each way = 1 Mandla,\n7 Mandlas = 1 Kan\u00e1l,\n8 Kan\u00e1ls = 1 Ghum\u00e1o.\n\n\"But generally the ghum\u00e1o is said to be four kachcha bighas. A kachcha bigah is 20 karams each way. The karam, however, is a very varying quantity, and it was here that the difference came in. The rulers had constant necessity for using a measure either for the land on which cash rates were charged (zabti), or for kankdlt appraisement of the crop; and there were in every petty state some persons whose pacing was recognized as the Government standard. The karam would be fixed by the ruler at so many chappas or hand breadths 16 to 18; and the pacing was done to suit this. In the more highly cultivated eastern villages the karim was smaller, and that of the Kheri il\u00e1qa, adjoining Umballa, was recognized as 16 chappas; while in Jagraon the karim was 18 chappas. This difference of measures has remained in force, and the kachcha bigah of Jagraon is about two-fifths, while that of Kheri is two-sevenths, or less, of the standard official bigah.\n\nThe scale of the kachcha bigah is\u2014\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n20 \\text{ karams} & \\times 1 \\text{ karam} = 1 \\text{ kachcha biswah}, \\\\\n20 & \\times 20 = 1 \\text{ kachcha bigah}.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n\"I may say here that we have finally adopted for future use a kachcha bigah, one-third the old pucka bigah, measured by a chain of 29 karams, the karam being 57 inches, and the chain 95 feet. This is a good average for the district, and fits into the old standard.\"\n\nThe Sutlej is bridged for the Sindh, Punjab and Delhi Railway at Phillour, just under Ludhiana town; and there are ferries with country boats at 13 places along its course through the district. The passage appears to be dangerous when the river is in flood, and boats are occasionally upset.\n\nIn former times there was a considerable amount of traffic carried in country boats down the river from R\u00fapar, M\u00e1chiw\u00e1ra, Ludhi\u00e1na to Ferozepore and even to Sakkar; but this ceased with the opening of the railway in 1870, and nothing is now carried down except timber or stones from the hills for the bridge works at Phillour. The Abohar Branch of the Sirhind Canal has been constructed for navigation between R\u00fapar and Ferozepore, and boats will soon be started on it. It is not possible to say what use will be made of this for traffic.\n\nThe Sindh, Punjab and Delhi Railway enters the district from Phillour by a bridge over the Sutlej, and runs through it to a distance of about 35 miles in a south-west direction. The principal stations are Ludhi\u00e1na, Sahnew\u00e1l and Khanna; and there are two or three smaller ones either in this district or in adjoining territory. The first-named of these is a very large and commodious one; and new goods-sheds are being constantly erected. There are generally\nseveral hundred waggons waiting to be loaded; and in the busiest seasons trains are constantly leaving. The S\u00e1hnew\u00e1l and Khanna stations pick up a fair amount of traffic at times; and the former is likely to increase in importance. A b\u00e1z\u00e1r is springing up in the village. A branch line along the canal to R\u00fapar was made by the Canal Department, and has just been given over to the Railway Company for working. There is also in prospect a line from Ludhi\u00e1na to Ferozepore.\n\nThe district is much better off than most in the way of metalled (kankar) roads. There are 125 miles of them, the whole area of the district being only 13 square miles. The principal metalled roads are the Umballa and Lahore road (via Phillour) and the Ferozepore road. These are under the Public Works Department and kept up by Government, while the District Committee maintains the others: (1) from Machiw\u00e1ri via Samr\u00e1la to Ludhi\u00e1na (26 miles); (2) from Ludhi\u00e1na to M\u00e1ler Kotla (so much as is in this district, (14 miles); (3) from D\u00e1kha on the Ferozepore road to R\u00e1ikot (14 miles). It is also intended to connect Samr\u00e1la and Khanna, which will give a metalled road between that station and Machiw\u00e1ri. Part of the plan has already been carried out. The greatest amount of traffic is along the Ludhi\u00e1na-Ferozepore road, which carries more than all the others together. Next in importance is the road to M\u00e1ler Kotla, and the R\u00e1ikot road is not much behind this. The Umballa road is now scarcely used for wheeled traffic; and along the Samr\u00e1la road there is a fair amount.\n\nThe principal unmetalled roads are: (1) the old road along the high bank, connecting Ludhi\u00e1na with Ferozepore and with R\u00fapar. This is now used by travellers only, as the sand is very deep and wheeled traffic is not possible. There is also a road from Machiw\u00e1ri through S\u00e1hnew\u00e1l and Pakhow\u00e1l to R\u00e1ikot, and thence on to the Jangal; but this is not much used. Another road connects Samr\u00e1la with Morinda. This joins the Kalka-Umballa road; but it is not much used, as carts go more easily the longer way by Umballa, the whole distance being metalled. A kachcha road runs through the B\u00e9t from Ludhi\u00e1na to the town of Rahon in Jullundur, and another is the old road direct from Ludhi\u00e1na to R\u00e1ikot. The only road remaining to be mentioned is one from R\u00e1ikot through Bassian to Jagraon, and from thence to Sidhw\u00e1n on the Dh\u00e1in. These roads are all maintained by the District Committee.\n\nMr. Walker writes: \"The district returns show 11,659 carts belonging to people of the district; but I think that this includes the ordinary carts used for agriculture. We have entered in the village note-books the number of carts 'working for hire,' that is, those going to Ludhi\u00e1na and beyond it with loads of grain, &c., (das\u00fawar\u00fada), and the total of these entries is 5,564 distributed as follows:\n\n| Location | Number |\n|----------|--------|\n| Samr\u00e1la  | 310    |\n| Ludhi\u00e1na | 2,881  |\n| Jagraon  | 2,373  |\n\"This return is probably not far out. It will be observed that there are very few in Samr\u012bla; and those of Ludhi\u0101na all come from the south-west. The cart used in the carrying trade is a development of the ordinary field cart. I am told that twenty or thirty years ago, when the carrying trade was in its infancy, carts of the size now generally used were almost unknown. When the people began to make trading expeditions they fixed to their carts a wooden frame, wider at the top than below; and lined this with the old stalks of the sugarcane, cotton twigs, cloth, &c. But an ordinary cart of this sort, drawn by two or three bullocks, could only carry fifteen maunds (pucka) of grain; and it was not long before the advantage of widening and lengthening the carts was seen; and they are now, at least most of those that come from the west, of a very superior pattern, drawn generally by five bullocks, and capable of carrying forty to fifty maunds of grain. The frame work of the sides is very strong, and lined with t\u012bt (called tapar) or matting made of san. Over the top is kept a thatch of munj reeds; or, if the owner can afford it, a thick carpet of wool, called khar, woven for the purpose. The latter is a perfect, and the former a partial protection from the rain.\" A first class cart will cost with all its appliances Rs. 100, and five bullocks, Rs. 250 to 300. Of course there are still a great many carts working, which are not of the first class. Along the metalled roads the carts go easily, and they can cover 20 miles, or two stages in 24 hours; but they have generally considerable distances along ordinary district roads before these are reached, and it requires at least the five bullocks to drag them even slowly through these. On the Ferozepore road one or two of the bullocks are generally to be seen tied up behind as a reserve. The heaviest loads come from the Ferozepore district (Moga and Zira), as the country to the south of R\u0101ikot is so very sandy that not more than about 30 maunds can be brought up to this place. A metalled road from R\u0101ikot to Sahua would be a great benefit. The Jat cartmen either devote the whole of their time to carrying, or only what they can spare from agriculture, which are the busy months of the grain trade. In the former case, the cartman is either a member of a family who have a joint holding, or he mortgages his land to another cultivator, getting a lump sum down for the use of it which he is always able to repay. The grain carried almost invariably belongs to the man who owns and drives the cart, for the Jats will not work for hire or carry for dealers. The cart is filled partly with the grain grown in the holding to which the cart belongs, and the load is made up by purchase in the village, or in others about.\n\nCamels come direct to Ludhi\u0101na from the Jangal villages by the unmetalled roads, carrying grain; and return with gur, salt, &c. They are useful where the roads are particularly sandy, and only a small load could be brought on a cart. A camel load is about six to eight maunds. Donkeys are used for bringing grain, gur, &c., from short distances into Ludhi\u0101na, eight or ten miles. A donkey carries 1\u00bd to 2 maunds. In 1879-80 the Deputy\nCommissioner supplied to the Transport Department 3,500 camels, 838 carts, 100 mules, 123 ponies, and 2,302 camp-followers drawn in part from the Native States across the border.\n\nThe Ferozepore and Umballa roads are a good deal used by troops marching in the cold weather, and there are encamping-grounds at Jagraon, D\u00e1kha, Ludhi\u00e1na, Dur\u00e1ha-ki-Sar\u00e1i (in a slip of Pati\u00e1la territory) and Khanna, with the usual sar\u00e1i and supply-house at each. There are several large private sar\u00e1\u00eds in Ludhi\u00e1na city, and one built by a benevolent native in Jagraon. There is a fine old imperial sar\u00e1i within a few miles of Khanna and on the Ludhi\u00e1na road. It is called Lashkari Kh\u00e1n's and was built in the time of Aurangzeb; but it is quite out of place now and never used. There is no traffic to speak of along the Umballa road on account of the railway; but the Jagraon and D\u00e1kha encamping grounds are always full of carts, ekk\u00e1s, &c. There are also encamping grounds with supply-house at Koh\u00e1r\u00e1 and Samr\u00e1l\u00e1, on the Samr\u00e1l\u00e1 road, which is now very rarely used by troops, but was formerly the high way to Simla and the hill stations from the Ludhi\u00e1na cantonment.\n\nThere is a regular d\u00e1k bungalow at Ludhi\u00e1na (with a kh\u00e1n-simah), and this is very much used by Europeans, who are passing through from Ferozepore or have business here. There are district (or police) bungalows at M\u00e1chiw\u00e1ra, at Koh\u00e1r\u00e1 and Samr\u00e1l\u00e1 on the Kalka road; at Khanna and S\u00e1hnew\u00e1l on the Umballa road; at Dahlon on the M\u00e1ler Kotla; and at D\u00e1kha and Jagraon on the Ferozepore roads; but these are very poor (except that at Koh\u00e1r\u00e1), being in most cases the burj or corner of the tahsil building or of a sar\u00e1i. The old Residency House at Bassian, built in 1838, is still kept up with its gardens and grounds which cover an area of 70 to 80 acres. Although a good part of the building has been pulled down, what is still left is too much to be kept in good repair. It is a pleasant place to spend a few days at, as the locality is one of the most healthy in the district. There are Public Works Department bungalows along the Ferozepore and Umballa roads at Khanna, Pindori (near D\u00e1kha), Jagraon, which have fair accommodation, and are available for district officers. There are canal bungalows at distances of ten miles along the branches of the canals; but these are generally occupied by the officers of the Department or by subordinates. The statement on the next page shows the recognized routes and stages with the accommodation, &c., for travellers to be found at each.\n\nThe first halt on the road to Lahore is at Phillour in the Jullundur district.\n\nThe mail to Ferozepore goes by horse d\u00e1k, and there is also a Government bullock train; and a horse d\u00e1k for passengers, not very efficiently maintained by a contractor. There is a district d\u00e1k carried by runners between Khanna and M\u00e1chiw\u00e1ra, Ludhi\u00e1na and Dahlon, Jagraon and R\u00e1ekot. Towards Lahore and Umballa the post of course goes by rail. There is a Government telegraph office at Ludhiana, and railway offices along the line at each station.\n| Route | Halting place | Number of miles | Remarks |\n|-------|---------------|-----------------|---------|\n| Ludhiana to Amritsar, Grand Trunk Road | Duraha-ki-Sarai, Patiala territory | 13 (From Ludhiana) | Encamping-ground with supply-houses, road bungalow; also old Imperial sarai, still in use. |\n| Khanna | ... | 28 | As above, only the sarai is of our time, and has a \"burj\" or room for Europeans. |\n| Ludhiana to Firozepore | Dakhla | ... | 12 | As at Khanna, but road bungalow one mile further on. |\n| Jagran | ... | 23 | As at Khanna, also road bungalow one mile further on.

The head-quarters staff of the district consists of a Deputy Commissioner, a Judicial Assistant, one European and two native Extra Assistant Commissioners, two Munsifs and a Tahsild\u00e1r.\n\nThe three tahsils of Ludhi\u00e1na, Jagraon and Samr\u00e1la are each in charge of a Tahsild\u00e1r assisted by a Naib-Tahsild\u00e1r.\n\n| Tahsil | Qanungos and Naibs | Girdawara | Patwari |\n|--------|-------------------|-----------|---------|\n| Ludhi\u00e1na Tahsil | 2 | 6 | 138 |\n| Jagraon | 2 | 2 | 79 |\n| Samr\u00e1la | 2 | 3 | 83 |\n\nThe village revenue staff is shown in the margin.\n\nThere are 4 Munsifs in the district, two at Ludhi\u00e1na and one at each of the outlying tahsils of Jagraon and Samr\u00e1la.\n\nThe Ludhi\u00e1na tahsil would appear to be inconveniently large. But the whole of the Malaudh pargan\u00e1h is held in jagirs by the family of the Malaudh Sard\u00e1rs, the land revenue of their estates being 85,077. The revenue and cesses are ordinarily paid by the lambard\u00e1rs to the jagird\u00e1rs themselves; although the collections of the B\u00e9r branch now go into the tahsil direct, as the estate is under the Court of Wards. This arrangement for direct collection is a convenience to the people and lessens the land revenue collection work of the tahsil materially. Besides this, when the Pakhow\u00e1l tahsil was broken up in 1866, the heads of the three branches of the Malaudh family were invested with criminal, civil, and revenue powers, and also created sub-registrars each within the area of the jagir held by the branch which he represented. The Bhai of Bagrian was also invested with similar powers in the isolated village from which he takes his name. The B\u00e9r Sard\u00e1r is at present a minor.\n\nThe statistics of civil and revenue litigation for the past five years are given in Table No. XXXIX. Mr. Walker writes: \"Compared with the adjoining districts of Hoshi\u00e1rpur and Jullundur this one cannot be called very litigious. The above statement gives an average of one civil case per annum to every 68 people; but considering the extent to which joint interest in property prevail in this country, and the number of parties that may be concerned in a single case, a comparison between this proportion and that given by the returns, at all events of European countries, would be misleading. The number of legal practitioners settled in the district is steadily increasing, and these are retained by the parties in most cases of any importance. I have already noticed the litigious spirit of the Aw\u00e1ns and Hindu Jats. The Jat villagers of the Jagraon tahsil in particular are always ready to rush into our courts;\"\nand, once a case has been started, it is fought out to the bitter end. It is generally a point of honour with them to take their cases up to the highest court of appeal that they can; and very large sums of money are spent in disputes where the value of the property is really trifling.\"\n\nThe executive staff of the district is assisted by two Honorary Magistrates in the town of Ludhi\u00e1na and three Honorary J\u00e1girdar-Magistrates in the j\u00e1g\u00edrs of R\u00e1mgarh, Malaudh and B\u00e1grian.\n\nThe police force of the strength marginally noted is controlled by one District Superintendent and one Inspector and eleven Deputy Inspectors. The district is in the circle of the Deputy Inspector General of Police of the Umballa circle, who resides at Umballa.\n\nThere are ten th\u00e1nas or police stations\u2014seven of the first-class at Ludhi\u00e1na, Jagraon, R\u00e1ikot, Dahlon, S\u00e1hnew\u00e1l, Khanna, M\u00e1ch\u00edw\u00e1r\u00e1; and three of the second class at Sahna, D\u00e1kha, Samr\u00e1la. Each station has a cattle-pound attached to it. There are police posts at intervals along the Ferozepore, Samr\u00e1la and Umballa roads; and the first of these is patrolled, as it was a favourite beat of the H\u00e1rnis and other criminal tribes, who used to steal from passing carts, ekkas, &c. The police duties of the Ludhi\u00e1na city are performed by the regular force; but in the other towns and in all villages, there are chaukid\u00e1rs, one or more, according to the number of the population; while, in some cases, two or three small villages are doubled up, and have one man appointed for them. The total number of this branch is 796. The chaukid\u00e1rs are paid in the villages Rs. 36 per annum, which is collected by a rate on the houses, and disbursed by the tahsild\u00e1rs. In the towns (except Baholpur) they get Rs. 4 a month, the jemadd\u00e1rs receiving Rs. 6; and are paid from octroi.\n\nThere is a district jail at Ludhi\u00e1na, with accommodation for 325 prisoners, in which short-term convicts are confined. The average number of prisoners during the last year was 266, exclusive of persons detained in the lock-up and for debt.\n\nTable No. XL gives statistics of criminal trials, Table No. XLI of police enquiries, and Table No. XLII of convicts in jail for the last five years.\n\nThe H\u00e1rnis, S\u00e1nsis and Baariahs are proclaimed under the Criminal Tribes Act, and the number of each on the register of 1883 is shown in the margin. Mr. Warburton, District Superintendent of Police, has kindly furnished the following note upon the criminal tribes of the dis-\nIn various disguises H\u00e1nis go about chiefly in the Manjha and the Jullundur Do\u00e1b, committing burglaries frequently attended with violence. They pretend to be Rajp\u00fat emigrants from R\u00e1jp\u00fatana, but I am inclined to think that in reality they are a section of the S\u00e1nsi tribe converted to Muhammadanism. They were nomads in the time of R\u00e1\u00ed Kalap, the chief of R\u00e1ikot, who employed them for the purpose of harassing his enemies by frequent and sudden nocturnal raids on their camps, which enabled the H\u00e1nis to carry off horses and other transport cattle.\n\nThe magnitude of their criminality will be readily conceived by the fact that out of 857 adults so many as 778 have previous convictions recorded against them. In short they are addicted to every species of crime against property, and enjoy the unenviable reputation of being the most criminal and troublesome class in the Punjab. They were domiciled in their present villages by R\u00e1ja Fatteh Singh, who was chief of Kapurthala at the time.\n\nIn this district the S\u00e1nsi class, with few exceptions, is addicted to burglary and robbery. Petty pilfering is the daily occupation of the S\u00e1nsi. At fairs and large gatherings for months his presence is felt by carrying off anything he can lay his hands on. In this district, unlike other parts of India, the S\u00e1nsis are not nomads but have fixed abodes in villages, and most of them keep up the genealogies of the Jat z\u00e1mind\u00e1rs. A very interesting account of the customs and habits of the S\u00e1nsis is given by Colonel Sleeman in his report on \"Badhuks alias Bagree dacoits and other gang robbers by hereditary profession\" submitted in 1849 to the Government of India:\n\nAt one time the Bauria class was a source of great annoyance to travellers and cultivators in this district. Their chief occupation was dacoity, burglary, and stealing grain and crops. Those who were unable to abandon their criminal avocations have sought other fields for their occupation by emigration, whilst those who are still in the district, beyond petty pilfering, are not troublesome.\n\nMr. Walker, in his Settlement Report, writes as follows:\n\n\"I do not think that the people of the district have a predilection for any special form of crime, most of the serious offences coming under the heads of theft and burglary. The G\u00fajars in the B\u00e9t do a good deal of cattle-lifting. The tribes registered as criminal are H\u00e1nis, Gounem\u00e1rs, S\u00e1nsis, Baurias, and punitive posts are maintained on their account in six villages with a total strength of 24 men. These are now drawn from surrounding districts, with a view to having the habitual criminals known wherever they are likely to go. The depredations of these people are seldom carried on in their own district, and they usually go great distances in the province and out of it in search of plunder, getting away from their villages in spite of all precautions, and although their absence is punished with imprisonment. The total number of these criminal classes by the police registers is 2,394, including men, women, and children, most being H\u00e1nis. The H\u00e1nis and Gounem\u00e1rs were settled down under the Sikhs in six small villages of Jagraon and...\"\nLudhiana District.\n\nCHAP. V.\u2014ADMINISTRATION AND FINANCE.\n\nLudhiana, where they own the land; and the others have now fixed residences in a few villages; but it is evident that all four tribes were originally gipsies, foreign to the country, and that for generations they wandered about committing petty thefts, begging, and living as they could. It appears impossible to break them off their habits. Where confined to villages, they are a pest to their neighbours, and the crops adjoining their lands require constant watching. They are very poor cultivators themselves. The Harnis possess a slang, of which the following words are specimens:\n\n| Nakh\u00e1r | theft. |\n| Bh\u00e1stri lag\u00e1na | to commit burglary. |\n| Khara | any Government official. |\n| Kotha | a constable or stranger. |\n| Katara | a Jat. |\n| Poh | to bury. |\n| Chetra | rupees. |\n| Tilkin | shoes. |\n| Dhotin | a woman. |\n| Take | clothes. |\n| Kharot | a lock. |\n\nThe gross revenue collections of the district for the last 14 years, so far as they are made by the Financial Commissioner, are shown in Table No. XXVIII, while Tables Nos. XXIX, XXXV, XXXIV and XXXIII give further details for land revenue, excise, license tax and stamps respectively. Table No. XXXII shows the number and situation of registration offices. A sum of Rs. 19,366 was fixed shortly after annexation as an equivalent of the services which the petty chiefs are bound to render to the paramount power, and is still levied by the j\u00e1girdars. It is generally at the rate of pay 2 to 4 annas per rupee of j\u00e1gir revenue, but sometimes at the pay of so many horse or footmen. There is only one distillery in the district at the Sadar. Poppy cultivation is allowed under an assessment of Rs. 2 per acre over and above the Government revenue, and the poppy heads can only be sold to licensed contractors according to rule.\n\nTable No. XXXVI gives the income and expenditure from District Funds, which are controlled by a committee consisting of 30 members selected by the Deputy Commissioner from among the leading men of the three tahsils, and of the Civil Surgeon and District Superintendent of Police as ex-officio members, with the Deputy Commissioner as President. The income is Rs. 69,000 on the new assessment; and the expenditure is on the usual objects. Some sixty miles of metalled roads have to be maintained from this source, and the expenditure on them is one of the heaviest items; but the nature of the country is not such as to render necessary any other great undertakings in the way of public works, and the rest of the funds are available for such purposes as education, sanitation, &c. The Municipal Committees, of which there are six, will be noticed separately under the towns which they represent. The total octroi income on the average of the last seven years is Rs. 74,070, and of the last year Rs. 93,764. Table No. XLV gives figures for past years.\n\nThe income from provincial properties for the last five years is shown below in rupees:\u2014\nThe ferries, bungalows and encamping grounds have already been noticed in Section D of Chapter IV, and the cattle pounds in this section. All the ferries on the Sutlej within the limits of the district are managed by the Ludhi\u00e1na officials, so that the receipts really belong to two districts. There are no large nazul properties worthy of special notice. Figures for other Government estates are given in Table No. XVII, and they and their proceeds are noticed in the succeeding section of this Chapter, in which the land revenue administration of the district is treated of. The income of the j\u00e1girdars, exclusive of the tribute, is Rs. 1,58,237, and Rs. 1,19,206 are raised for the payment of village officials (lambard\u00e1rs, patw\u00e1ris and chaukid\u00e1rs). Including land revenue the total taxation amounts to Rs. 16,69,807, levied in a district with a population of 618,835, giving Rs. 2-11 per head of the population. It is not meant that the whole of this taxation falls eventually on the people of the district; and there are other forms of indirect taxation, such as the salt duty, which do not come into the account.\n\nTable No. XXXVII gives figures for the Government and aided, high, middle and primary schools of the district. There is a Government high school at Ludhi\u00e1na, and there are no fewer than ten middle schools\u2014at Jagraon, R\u00e1ikot, Khanna, M\u00e1chiw\u00e1r\u00e1, Dehru, Sawaddi, Guj\u00e1rw\u00e1l, Raipur, Mal\u00e1udh, Badhow\u00e1l. There are 60 primary schools for boys and 19 schools for girls. The district lies within the Delhi circle which forms the charge of the Inspector of Schools at Delhi. In addition to the Government schools mentioned above there are the aided American Presbyterian Mission High and Boarding Schools and the Church of England Zenana Mission Training Schools. There is also the aided Hindu School and a School of Industry kept up by the Ludhi\u00e1na Anjuman Mufid-i-Am, the chief object of which is to encourage and improve the local industry of the town in carpet-making and shawl-making. There are 396 indigenous schools in the district. Table No. XIII gives statistics of education collected at the Census of 1881, and the general state of education has already been described in Section B of Chapter III, in which, and in Section C of the same Chapter, information will be found regarding the indigenous and missionary schools. The following account of the High School is furnished by the head master:\n\nThis school was started as a private vernacular seminary on the 27th of October 1864, at the instance and with the aid of certain leading members of the Hindu and Muhammadan\nLudhi\u0101na District.\n\nCHAP. V.\u2014ADMINISTRATION AND FINANCE.\n\ncommunities of Ludhi\u0101na, who felt it a desideratum, since there was no institution where secular education could be obtained, and many objected to send their children to the Mission school where religious instruction was (as it now is) compulsory. This private seminary in April, 1865, became a Government grant-in-aid school, and was created a purely Government high vernacular school in 1870. In 1875 English was introduced in it, which wrought a thorough change in its character, that is from a high vernacular school it was transformed into a high district school like those of Delhi, Lahore, Amritsar, &c., with a vernacular department attached.\n\nUnlike other high schools of the Punjab it now contains a special department wherein only English is taught for the first two years of their pupilage to such students as join this department after passing successfully the middle school examination in the vernacular. In the third year they join the regular Vth or the entrance class of the school, and thus finish their English study in the school in three years. The present school house, which was built in 1882, is too small for the school, and additional accommodation has to be rented.\n\nThe construction, however, of another school house for the primary school, with accommodation for the boarders round it, within the new school compound is under consideration. The management of the institution is in the hands of a head master, assisted by a staff of eighteen teachers.\n\nThe number of pupils, and the result of examination for the last five years, are given in the subjoined statement:\n\n| Departments | 1878-79 | 1879-80 | 1880-81 | 1881-82 | 1882-83 |\n|-------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Upper department | 46 | 48 | 35 | 27 | 14 |\n| Middle department | 120 | 49 | 7 | 1 | 16 |\n| Primary department | 77 | 247 | 39 | 227 | 9 |\n\nTable No. XXXVIII gives separate figures for the last five years for each of the dispensaries of the district, which are under the control of the civil surgeon, and at Ludhi\u0101na in the immediate charge of an Assistant Surgeon. The outlying dispensaries at Jagraon and M\u0101chiv\u0101r\u0101 are in charge of hospital assistants. There are also three dispensing centres, if they may be so called, at Ludhi\u0101na, Raekot and Khanna in charge of compounders for dispensing gratis English and country medicines for simple ailments. The Sadar dispensary, which was founded in 1853, is situated on the south-east of the town, near the district jail. It contains accommodation for 16 male and 16 female indoor patients. The staff consists of one assistant surgeon, one clerk, two compounders, two dressers and menials. It is maintained almost entirely from district and municipal funds, the private subscriptions being exceedingly small. It is managed by a dispensary committee under the general control of the municipal and district committees.\nMedicines are distributed gratis to in-door and out-door patients, and in-door patients without private means are dieted at the cost of the institution. The following statement shows the annual expenditure and number of in-door and out-door patients for the five years from 1878 to 1882:\n\n| Year | In-door | | Out-door | | Expenditure |\n|------|---------|---|----------|---|-------------|\n|      | M. | F. | Ch. | Total | M. | F. | Ch. | Total | in Rupees |\n| 1878 | 532 | 117 | 63 | 702 | 14,519 | 5,926 | 3,851 | 24,296 | 5,450 |\n| 1879 | 462 | 121 | 32 | 615 | 13,475 | 5,433 | 4,495 | 23,403 | 4,240 |\n| 1880 | 339 | 107 | 41 | 537 | 13,065 | 5,641 | 3,894 | 22,600 | 4,932 |\n| 1881 | 455 | 146 | 60 | 671 | 13,613 | 5,368 | 3,865 | 22,876 | 6,381 |\n| 1882 | 377 | 151 | 54 | 582 | 13,828 | 5,101 | 4,440 | 23,369 | 6,450 |\n\nLudhi\u00e1na is an out-station in charge of the chaplain of Umballa, who pays an occasional visit. The old cantonment church, a square, unsightly building, with accommodation for 500 worshippers, is still standing, and was used till recently; but it has now been condemned, the roof being pronounced unsafe, and it is intended to replace it by a smaller one. The old cantonment cemetery is crowded with tombs of more or less hideous design, and is still used.\n\nThe head-quarters of the first division of the Sirhind canal, which at present covers the whole length of the main line and both branches (Abohar and Bhatinda) in this district is at Ludhi\u00e1na. The whole canal is under a Superintending Engineer at Umballa. The Grand Trunk Road and the district works along it are in charge of an Engineer at Umballa (Provincial Works). The telegraph office is under the Superintendent of Telegraphs, Umballa; and the post offices under a Superintendent stationed at Ludhi\u00e1na. The two forest plantations are under the Assistant Conservator at Phillour. The fort and its buildings, with rest-houses for troops and the military hospital, are under the charge of the Executive Engineer of Military Works at Umballa. The portion of the railway which traverses the district is managed by the railway staff at Umballa.\n\nThe fort at Ludhi\u00e1na is garrisoned at present by a company of a native regiment from Jullundur, under the command of a European officer. It is in the Umballa military division. There are a few volunteers, part of the Rupar Company of the Punjab Rifles, and a Rifle Range.\n\nSECTION B.\u2014LAND & LAND REVENUE.\n\nEARLY SETTLEMENTS.\n\nIn the Ain-i-Akbari we have under the head of \"Tribute and Taxes\" (Gladwin's Translation, Vol. I, Part III) a complete account of the great Emperor's revenue system, and some reference to those that had preceded it. The ministers, Todar Mal and Muzaffar Khan between the sixteenth and twenty-fourth years of the\nglorious reign elaborated a scheme for fixing the land-revenue of the Empire, and for giving security to the husbandman, which is nearly as complete as our own. One standard chain and bigah were first introduced; then land was classified into poolej or cultivated every harvest, and perovly, chechar, banjer (Gladwin's spelling), fallow and arable waste. The average produce of each crop was then struck from the estimated value of the yield of three classes of poolej or regularly cultivated land; and of this one-third was taken as the Government due, all extra cesses being at the same time stopped, and salaries to be paid in cash from the Imperial Treasury being fixed for the officials, who had before that lived on the people. From the twenty-fifth year of the reign a ten-years' settlement was introduced, the value of the Government share in each crop being taken at the average of the preceding ten years. Elaborate instructions were at the same time formulated for the guidance of the Collectors (Amilguzars) and subordinate agency. The assessment was apparently a fluctuating one, the rates on crops being fixed for the period; but the people were allowed to pay in kind if they chose. The rates were uniform for subahs or provinces; and no special information is to be obtained about this district in particular, as it is made up of several of the 33 mahals of the Sirhind sarkar or division, of which the whole land-revenue is set down at 40 lakhs of rupees (16,07,90,540 d\u00e3ms). Tables are given in the Ain of the rates collected on every crop during a period of nineteen years from a bigah of poolej or cultivated land in each subah. Wheat paid generally from Rs. 1 to Rs. 2 a bigah; gram, &c., from 8 annas to Re. 1; ponda sugarcane, from Rs 4-8 to Rs. 5; other cane, from Rs. 2 to Rs. 3; cotton, from Re 1-8 to Rs. 3; pulses and millets (moth, mung, jo\u00e1r, &c.) from 4 annas to Re. 1. It was not to be expected that any more particular information as to the assessments paid by villages or tracts 300 years ago would be forthcoming; and, as the country was but partially under cultivation, and the present villages did not then exist at all or their limits have much changed since then, it would scarcely be of much use even if available. The rates fixed are, however, interesting.\n\nIt is impossible to say to what extent the system of Akbar was maintained by his successors; but the administration of the revenue must have suffered in the general disorganization of the Government under the later Emperors; and in all parts it came to be a struggle between the collectors and the payers of revenue, the former trying to take as much, and the latter to give as little as they could. The custom of leasing a large tract of outlying territory to some person of importance, who paid a fixed sum annually, and made his own arrangements for collection (mustafir or zamindar) must have been recognized even in Akbar's time, for the western mahals of the district were always held by the Rais on these terms. The Phulkian and Maler Kotla chiefs, too, were originally lessees, and held their territories subject to the payment of what was really an annual tribute. The mustafir was liable to pay the sum so fixed, but was otherwise independent; and it was only when he withheld payment that the Imperial authorities interfered.\nThe *must\u0101jir*, if his circle of villages was small, took a share of the produce from the cultivator, or sometimes cash rents on particular crops; but generally, as he held a large tract, he sublet it in smaller circles to others who dealt direct with the cultivators. The eastern parts of the district were at first directly managed by the Governor of Sirhind, because they were within easy reach, and an assessment was fixed year by year for each village; but, as the Imperial authority weakened, and collections became more difficult, the system of leasing *tappahs* or circles of villages spread. The principal *must\u0101jir* or assignee in this district was the Rai of Raikot. The family began with a few villages, but gradually extended their boundaries, undertaking the revenue management (called *katkana*) of outlying circles of villages as the Governor of Sirhind lost control of them; till finally they held more than half of this, and a good part of the Ferozepore district. The Malaudh Sard\u0101rs, like others of the Phulkian stock, had also a lease, and paid tribute to the Emperor, taking a share of the produce from the husbandmen. There were other *must\u0101jirs* of less note, such as the Garewal Chaudhris of Raipur and Gujarwal, who had a small circle of villages, and paid revenue direct into the Imperial Treasury. The ability to realize the revenue has always been the test of power in this country; and we find that, as the imperial authority grew weaker, the *must\u0101jirs* were less regular in their payments; while the villages directly assessed would only pay when forced to. As an illustration the following incidents that took place about the year 1740 A.D. may be recounted. The Rai (Kalha) was not paying up his revenue regularly, and informed the *Subah* or Governor of Sirhind that he could not realize from the villages. This was reported at Delhi, and Ali Mahomed Rohela was sent to bring the people to order. He marched out of Ludhi\u0101na towards Jagraon, putting to death lumb\u0101rs here and there by way of example; but he soon found that it was the Rai himself who had created the difficulty and incited the people to withhold payments. Ali Mahomed then turned on the Rai, and, with the assistance of the Phulkians, chased him out of the country.\n\nAn account of the manner in which the country was partitioned on the disruption of the empire and the fall of Sirhind (A.D. 1763) has already been given. The western portions of the district were already in the possession of the Rais and of the Malaudh Sard\u0101rs, who between them held the greater part of the Ludhi\u0101na and Jagraon tahs\u012bls; while Samr\u0101la and some of the western villages of Ludhi\u0101na, which had hitherto been under the direct revenue management of the Governor of Sirhind, were seized on in groups by a number of petty Sikh Chiefs from across the Sutlej. The only difference that the change made to the Rais and to the Malaudh Sard\u0101rs was that they ceased to pay tribute. The petty chiefs from the M\u0101njha brought with them their system, if such it may be called, of revenue; and when in 1806\u20149 A.D. M\u0101har\u0101ja Ranjit Singh extended his territories to this side of the river, annexing all the country held by the Rais, and absorbing several\nof the petty chiefs, this may be said to have been introduced all over the district. Ranjit Singh divided his conquests between himself and the Kapurthala, L\u00e1dwa, N\u00e1bha and Jind chiefs in the manner described in Chapter II. The greater part was either retained by himself or given to the first of these. The expression system of revenue has been used above, but it may be said of the Sikhs as rulers, whether in the Punjab proper or in the M\u00e1lwah, that their system was to exact as much from the cultivator as was possible without making him throw up his land. No one will claim for Ranjit Singh the reputation of a mild and benevolent ruler. On the contrary the careless manner in which he leased out tracts of country along with the revenue payers inhabiting them to the man who was willing to give most, or to some worthless court favourite, showed that he had a complete disregard for the welfare of his subjects. It was only when by some happy chance a really enlightened ruler of the stamp of S\u00e1wan Mal was entrusted with the government of a portion of his conquests that any consideration was shown for the people. The chiefs, great and small, pursued the same object as the Mahar\u00e1ja, i.e., to get what they could out of the peasantry; and the only restraining influence was the fear of losing the revenue-payers. Land was then plentiful, and cultivators scarce, so that there was the danger of a chief driving away his villagers into the territories of a neighbour who was not quite so bad. In effect the chiefs were landlords who exacted from their tenants the utmost that they could without driving them away. There was a strong feeling on the part of the peasantry that they had a right to cultivate the land, and it was only the most extreme tyranny that would separate them from it; but on the other hand the demands of the chief on the produce were limited solely by his own discretion.\n\nMahar\u00e1ja Ranjit Singh leased the territory reserved for himself in circles of villages, the lessees being changed from time to time. Thus the family of the Vak\u00edla held the parganah of S\u00e1hnew\u00e1l, paying Rs. 1,00,000 per annum for it; and Jemad\u00e1r Khush\u00e1l Singh held about 150 villages in different places. These lessees made their own arrangements with the villages year by year, generally taking care to leave a margin of about one-fourth as profit on what they paid into the Lahore treasury. For some villages a cash demand was fixed, in others a share of the produce was taken or the cash value of the Government share was determined by appraisement. The Kapurthala (Ahluw\u00e1lia) chief had a large tract of country on this side of the river, nearly the whole of the Jagraon tahsil; and the method of fixing the assessment in his possessions may be taken as a sample and appears to have been as follows. The tahsild\u00e1r went from village to village every year, and first made an offer to the lambard\u00e1rs of the assessment at a certain sum for that year (this method being known as mushakhasa). This was often accepted; but, if not, a valuation of the Government share of the produce for the year was made by a committee selected from the respectable lambard\u00e1rs of the neighbourhood. For the Rabi harvest an appraisement (kan) of the value of the yield from each field was made when the crop was ripe; and for the Khar\u00edf crops\nfixed cash rates were generally applied. The resulting assessment for the year was seldom exacted in full, notwithstanding the free use of the various recognized methods of torture; and large balances were generally allowed to accrue. The lesser Sikh chiefs took a share of the produce in the Rabi, and cash revenue according to certain rates for the Kharif crops. They were really \"zamindars\" in the Bengal sense of the word; and will still assert that the land of the two or three villages that they held belonged to them. The rates paid by the cultivators on the zabti crops were as follows:\n\n| Crop                          | Rate per acre |\n|-------------------------------|---------------|\n| Cane                          | Rs. A. P.     |\n| Maize, Cotton                 | Rs. A. P.     |\n| Charri, Moth, &c.             | Rs. A. P.     |\n| Carrots and other vegetables, Poppy, &c. | Rs. A. P. |\n\nThese rates were fixed for a kaehcha bigah or ghum\u00e1o, which varied a good deal throughout the district, each chief having his own standard. The kaehcha bigah has been taken at one-third of the Government standard, as this was about the average.\n\nThe rate at which the chief realized his share of the produce was generally one-third of the grain and one-fourth of the straw. The share of the grain was often fixed as high as half. The Rais are said to have only taken one-fourth grain; and their rule is still spoken of with regret. One would have thought that with rates fixed so high the peasant would have little left for his maintenance; but besides the regular revenue there were the usual dues in cash or in kind, paid to the chief or to the harpies who represented him in his dealings with the people. It was impossible that the cultivator should pay out of his produce all that he was supposed to; and his main resource was pilfering from the field or grain heap before division. The saying \"bataie lutaie\" applied with equal effect to both parties. There were about a dozen dues levied in cash under some absurd pretence or other; and, if we add to this that the chief quartered his men and horses on the villagers, and that the latter had to contribute their labour gratis whenever called upon to do so, we may imagine that the lot of the husbandman was not a happy one, and that he could scarcely call his life his own. It will require a training for several generations to efface the results of a system like this, and to convince the people that such a thing as honesty is possible in the relations between Government and the revenue-payers.\n\nIn 1835 we acquired in the manner described in Chapter II a small portion of territory round Ludhi\u00e1na and Bassian, in all 74 villages. These were managed in much the same way as the surrounding native territory for four years; then a summary cash assessment was fixed for three years; and finally in 1842 a Settlement was made for twenty years, apparently by the assistant political officers, Captain Mills, Messrs. Vansittart and Edgeworth. There is no English report of this Settlement, which was probably more or less of a regular one on the model of\nthose of the North-West Provinces; and from paragraph 71 of Mr. Davidson's report (written in 1853) it appears that none was submitted. A complete vernacular record with maps was made out; but this was revised when the rest of the district came under Settlement in 1850, and the assessments of 1842 were at the same time reduced where necessary, enhancements being deferred till the expiry of the full term of the original Settlement. Seventy-one villages, which had paid Rs. 75,680 in 1842, had their assessment reduced to Rs. 74,893. Three villages were not assessed in 1842, because held revenue-free. It will be seen from this that the assessment of 1842 differs but slightly from that fixed after revision.\n\nThe rest of the district came into our hands after the Sutlej campaign of 1845-46 (see Chapter II), and a summary assessment was fixed by the first Deputy Commissioner, Captain Larkins, who held charge from 1846 to 1849, Sir G. Campbell, who succeeded him, completing such work as remained to be done. The only guide for the assessing officer was the amount collected from each village by our predecessors; and this was ascertained, so far as possible, for a period of five years from the old papers, statements of leading men, &c. A very liberal deduction was made from the results arrived at in favour of the people, the amount of this varying from three to six annas in the rupee. The jagir villages were excluded from these operations, and the jagirdars were allowed to continue their collections as before, till after the annexation of the Punjab in 1849, when it was decided that a cash demand should be offered to all villages alike. The assessments of the Summary Settlement were accepted readily; and, considering the data on which they were founded, worked wonderfully. A few villages became disorganized, probably owing to the change of system, and reductions had to be made here and there; but the people welcomed a fixed demand, and this need not excite our surprise when we think of what they had borne under our predecessors. It is usual to contrast the elasticity of native systems of revenue with the rigidity of ours; but it was the complete want of fixity that made the Sikh system a curse to the country. The best way of forming an idea of the fairness of the summary assessment as a whole is to observe the extent to which it was necessary a few years after to revise it in the Regular Settlement. The following figures are taken from Mr. Barnes' review of the Regular Settlement, Appendix A, which shows the final result after he had made some alterations in Mr. Davidson's new assessments:\n\n| Name of Tahsil | Assessment | Decrease per cent. |\n|----------------|------------|--------------------|\n|                | Summary or by Jagirdars' estimate | Regular | |\n| Pakhowal      | 2,88,141   | 2,55,960           | 11     |\n| Jagraon       | 1,74,334   | 1,68,383           | 3      |\n| Ludhiana      | 2,46,780   | 2,42,150           | 2      |\n| Samrala       | 2,30,338   | 2,50,108           | 20     |\n| Total         | 10,45,509  | 9,25,600           | 11     |\nAs noticed above, the j\u00e1g\u00edr villages were excluded from the summary assessment, and this statement includes the j\u00e1g\u00edrd\u00e1rs' estimate of their previous collections.\n\nThe Regular Settlement operations commenced in 1850; and the assessments were announced between that and 1853. They were framed under the regulations of the time and the instructions of the North-Western Provinces Board of Revenue, embodied in the \"Directions to Settlement Officers.\" The edition of this work then in force lays down the rule \"that the Government should not demand more than two-thirds of what may be expected to be the net produce to the proprietor during the term of Settlement, leaving to the proprietor one-third as his profits and to cover the cost of collection.\" In paragraphs 40 and 41 of his report, Mr Davidson has given an account of how his calculations were worked out. There was a very elaborate classification of soils, each tahsil was considered by parganahs (of which there were 19), and the villages of each parganah were divided into three classes according to quality. In each class of villages the rent for every crop and soil was calculated; in the case of the Kharif cash rents (zabti), which were actually in use for the principal crops and had been taken by our predecessors, giving the necessary data. For crops on which the rent was ordinarily taken in kind a rate of yield as ascertained from experiment and inquiry was assumed, the proprietor's share calculated at the prevailing rate of rent in kind, and the value of this worked out at the average of the prices current for ten years. The rental of each village was the total of the rents of each crop and soil. For the kharif harvest the rental calculated was very little out, if at all. The rates assumed do not vary much from parganah to parganah, and there were the old Sikh zabti rates to go on besides existing cash rates of rent; the estimates of yield are much less reliable. As a rule the irrigated rates are much too low; and, although the cultivation may have improved, it cannot have done so to the extent that a comparison of the papers of the revised and those of the Regular Settlement would indicate. As to the proportion of the gross produce taken to represent the proprietor's share, part of paragraph 9 of the Chief Commissioner's review of the report (\"the equitableness of the rate, &c.\") appears to have been written under a mis-apprehension, and indeed is scarcely intelligible. The rate adopted as proprietor's share was one-third of the gross produce in the uplands, and two-fifths in the B\u00e9t; and of this rental two-thirds was taken as the share of Government, that is, as the revenue rate jama. Mention of the prices current used in the estimates of Regular Settlement will be found elsewhere, but it may be stated here that the prices fixed, though warranted by the information then at the disposal of the Settlement Officer, were too high for the following ten years (1850\u201460), which was a period of very low prices.\n\nThe inquiries made at the revision of Settlement showed that the weak point of these calculations of the rental was the produce estimate, the rates of yield not being carefully determined; but even with this the rentals were very near the truth in most cases. From them a deduction was next made in favour of the proprietor. Under the instructions quoted above this would be one-third; but in paragraph 43\nMr. Davidson says that he adhered to no abstract rule, but adjusted his demand to that \"prevailing in the parganah,\" which would be the summary jama. The balance, after making this reduction from the rental, was the revenue rate assessment. Having got his revenue rate assessment for each village the Settlement Officer used it as a guide in assessing, but did not adhere to it at all closely, the total of his actual assessments being considerably below it and only 58 per cent. of his estimated rental.\n\nIn paragraphs 9 to 31 of his review Mr. Barnes gives an account of Mr. Davidson's assessments for each tahsil (there were then four of them). Those of Pakhowal tahsil Mr. Barnes considered moderate; and few complaints were made to him. Pakhowal comprised the lower part of the present Ludhiana tahsil, with the Akalgarh and Bassian parganahs of Jagraon. The Malaudh jagir had not been before assessed. The details given in the review for this parganah shew that in khalsa villages the summary assessment of Rs. 1,67,647 was raised to Rs. 1,79,425; while in the jagir villages a nominal summary assessment, which had been estimated at Rs. 1,15,938, was reduced to Rs. 74,950.\n\nThe treatment of the Jagraon tahsil was considered to be not so successful, and numerous complaints were made. The assessments of the Hatur parganah were reduced by 14 per cent.; and relief was also given in Jagraon parganah. The figures for the whole tahsil shown in the review are:\n\n| Summary assessment | Rs. 1,74,195 |\n|---------------------|--------------|\n| Mr. Davidson's assessments | Rs. 1,79,282 |\n| As reduced by Mr. Barnes | Rs. 1,68,388 |\n\nEven after this Mr. Barnes expressed himself very doubtful as to whether the Settlement would stand. At the present time the Hatur and Jagraon parganahs are undoubtedly in a more prosperous condition than any other part of the district, except perhaps the Jangal villages; and it is hard to realise the \"appearance of squalor and poverty\" to which Mr. Barnes refers. The explanation seems to be that these parganahs, which lie on the Ferozepore border, have always been dependant on a comparatively light rainfall, the proportion of irrigation being at present about five per cent. There had been two or three bad years when Mr. Barnes saw the tract in 1855, and the prices of the inferior grains (mixed gram and wheat, or gram and barley mostly) were very low. Be this as it may, the forebodings of the review have not been realized.\n\nThe Settlement of the Ludhiana tahsil was considered to be better than that of Jagraon, and there was little or no complaint. The new demand was a reduction from Rs. 2,46,787 to Rs. 2,42,704, or of one per cent.\n\nSamr\u0101la tahsil Mr. Barnes considered to have been before \"grievously over-assessed.\" The nominal reduction given by Mr. Davidson from the Summary Settlement jama was from Rs. 3,43,509 to Rs. 2,62,582, or 23 per cent. If we exclude the jagirdars' estimates the reduction was about 20 per cent. Few complaints were made about the Regular Settlement assessment.\nIt is evident from what Mr. Barnes writes that two or three years after the new assessments had been announced they were subjected to a searching scrutiny; and such defects as appeared were at once remedied. The Commissioner visited every part of the district and freely exercised his power of revision; and no man of his day had greater knowledge of the work of assessing than Mr. Barnes. The total of the reduction given outside of the Jagraon tahsil was inconsiderable.\n\nThe period for which the Regular Settlement was sanctioned formed the subject of some correspondence in 1879; and the circumstances connected with this are mentioned so as to prevent future misunderstandings. The term of the Regular Settlement of 1842 was twenty years. Mr. Davidson's assessments were introduced between 1850\u201453; and the tenders were taken for thirty years, either from the date on which they were written, or, when in the case of the villages settled in 1842 enhancement was proposed, from 1862, i.e., after the expiry of the original period of twenty years. In para. 23 of the letter (No. 686, dated 11th August, 1856, printed with the Regular Settlement Report) in which the orders of Government on the settlement were conveyed to the Financial Commissioner, the sanction is said to be \"for the period of thirty years, i.e., up to A.D. 1880.\" But the orders of Government were lost sight of, probably in the confusion resulting from the mutiny; and the tenders of engagement remained unaltered, and show the periods as not expiring till 1892 and 1893 in the case of some villages. It was held in 1879, on a reference to Government, that the period of Settlement for the whole district should be taken as expiring in 1880; and that this should be notified to the people.\n\nThere was only one refusal to engage for the Regular Settlement assessment, the village of Bairsal in Jagraon being leased for ten or twelve years. In a few villages proprietary rights were transferred on account of refusal to engage in 1842, or for balances found to be due in 1847; but it does not appear that any difficulties followed the introduction of the Regular Settlement assessment of 1850. In only one village has the assessment been reduced since the revisions of Mr. Barnes. Notwithstanding that the assessment was severely tried by two periods of scarcity, the officers who have held charge of the district since all bear testimony to the fact that the assessment was light and fairly distributed. No coercive measures have been resorted to. The balances due to suspensions in the years of scarcity were insignificant (less than one per cent. of the demand), and were quickly realized. There has been little difficulty in collection anywhere, except in some parts of the B\u00e9t; and it may be said that any apparent slackness is due, not to inability to pay, but to a hereditary unwillingness to do so. This element will be appreciated if we compare our mild methods of getting in the revenue with those employed by our predecessors. A lambard\u00e1r, who has probably had experience of the latter, is not likely to care much for the issue of a warrant. In the Muhammadan B\u00e9t (R\u00e1jp\u00fat and G\u00fajar) villages there is generally a scarcity of cash, and the revenue\nhas systematically to be borrowed; but this would still be the case if we were to reduce it by half.\n\nIn a series of Appendices (No. Va.\u2014c) to the new Settlement Report has been collected such information as could be obtained relating to the transfers of land during the last 30 years. The general result may be stated for the whole district that two per cent. of the area has been sold in the last thirty years, and that at present eight per cent. is held in mortgage with possession, these proportions being fairly equal everywhere except that in Jagraon the area mortgaged is 12 per cent. Mortgages without possession are very uncommon. One agriculturist will not advance money to another unless he gets land into his possession sufficient to give a fair return; while the money-lending classes give credit on running accounts, or, if the borrower's credit is not good, on land transferred to them.\n\nThe registration returns show that the number of transfers previous to 1865 was very small; but that it has not varied very much during the three periods of five years, 1866\u201480. The general question of what the causes are which have led to the transfers since 1865 is a very wide one. They cannot be a sign either of want of prosperity or of undue pressure of the land-revenue, for the agricultural population has never been so well off as during these fifteen years, and the profits of cultivation have never been so great. There can be no doubt that, on the contrary, they indicate prosperity, and may be due to extravagance resulting from a sudden influx of wealth. It is remarkable that the proportion of area in mortgage should be higher in Jagraon than in the other tahsils, although we know that the condition of the Jats here is superior to that of the agricultural population of any other part. It should also be added that mortgages are very often not due to any real pressure of debt; but merely a method of raising money temporarily required; and sometimes, too, they are a mere form of tenure.\n\nIn the next place it is important to see into whose hands the transferred land has come. The following is an abstract of Appendices Va. and b. of the Settlement Report.\n\n| Percentage | Co-parceners | Other agriculturists | Non-Agriculturists | Total |\n|------------|--------------|----------------------|--------------------|-------|\n| Sold to    |              |                      |                    |       |\n| Held in mortgage by | 43 | 14 | 43 | 100 |\n\nThe inference from this is that the agriculturists can hold their own against the class whose profession is money-lending far better than in most districts of the province. The Jats of the uplands at all events seldom allow an outsider to acquire permanently any land in a village community. The right of pre-emption is generally claimed and insisted on; and it would be also in the case of mortgages if the law allowed of this. Every well-to-do Jat who has saved a little money will endeavour to invest it in a mortgage of\nland, and some of the tribe have established very large money-lending connections. Amongst the Muhammadaus of all tribes, too, there are a good number of men who hold land in mortgage. It would never be difficult for a cultivator in the uplands to raise a loan on his land from a co-sharer; and this could generally be done also in most parts of the lowlands. But there is often a prejudice against borrowing money except from a regular money-lender. There are some very large bankers of the regular money-lending class in Ludhi\u00e1na, Jagraon, Raikot and M\u00e1chiw\u00e1ra, who carry on a large business with the villagers, and also some scattered over the district; but the mass of the Jat population can get on without any assistance, and have generally some cash in hand. The total outstanding debt on mortgage is returned as upwards of Rs. 20,00,000 or about two years of the revenue demand. Of the money owed on book debt we have no details.\n\nAppendices Va, and V of the Settlement Report (statistics taken from the patw\u00e1ris' annual papers) give the average price per acre as Rs. 34, or 26 times the revenue demand, and the mortgage money secured per acre (with possession) as Rs. 32, or 28 times the revenue demand. The price which land will fetch varies a good deal over the district; and appears to be highest in Jagraon and the Jangal where the labour of cultivators is small, the revenue light, and the rate of rent in kind high. The great rise in the price of the inferior grains has also had probably something to do with this.\n\nTHE CURRENT SETTLEMENT.\n\nIn 1879 Mr. T. G. Walker began the revision of the revenue settlement, which he completed in 1883. His report will be found to contain the fullest possible detail; and the following pages, which are taken from it almost without alteration, touch upon the most important features and the general results of the revision. The general considerations upon which the new assessment was mainly based were the increase or decrease of cultivation, and of the means of production, the alterations in the price of agricultural produce and the general improvements in resources and condition of the tract under the expiring settlement.\n\nThe following figures from the statement in para. 6 of Mr. Davidson's report of the First Regular Settlement show the area at that time still available for cultivation, and beneath are added the proportions as shown by the papers of the new survey:\n\n| Settlement     | Total area | Cultivated | Culturable | Barren waste |\n|----------------|------------|------------|------------|--------------|\n| Regular, 1850  | 875,968    | 668,503    | 133,068    | 76,397       |\n| Revised, 1890  | 882,167    | 729,009    | 86,664     | 66,494       |\nThe increase in cultivation has been for the whole district nearly eight per cent.; and there is now 9\u00bd per cent. of arable waste returned. The increase is thus distributed over the three tahsils:\n\n| Tahsil     | Area Irrigated | No. of Wells |\n|------------|----------------|--------------|\n| Samrala    |                |              |\n| Ludhiana   |                |              |\n| Jagraon    |                |              |\n\nand the percentage is highest in the Pawddh and Jangal assessment circles of the Ludhi\u00e1na tahsil and in Jagraon. Notwithstanding the figures, there is little room now for further extension, and that the margin left at the Regular Settlement has since been filled up. Nearly one-third of the culturable land of our returns is in the B\u00e9t, where it is more difficult than elsewhere to say of much of the waste that it is or is not capable of producing a crop that would repay the cost of cultivation. In the Dh\u00e1ia the culturable consists of areas left for grazing, which are of considerable extent in some of the outlying and western villages, but generally very small patches, just enough for the cattle to stand in.\n\nThe only other way in which the productive power of the land has been increased is by the addition of the means of irrigation. The following statement of irrigation and of masonry wells shows the extent of this in each tahsil:\n\n| Tahsil     | Area Irrigated | No. of Wells |\n|------------|----------------|--------------|\n| Regular Settlement | 44,633         | 2,547        |\n| Now        | 46,645         | 2,750        |\n\nThe increase in the area irrigated has been seven per cent., and in the number of wells 16 per cent.; but most of the new wells are small ones sunk in the low lands under Ludhi\u00e1na. From this it will be seen that, even if it were allowable to tax to the full improvements due to the sinking of new wells, the enhancement on this account would be a small item; and the Settlement Officer dealt very leniently in his assessments with irrigated land, besides taking care that the constructors of new works should enjoy the full period of protection allowed to them by the orders of Government.\n\nAs an Appendix (XII) to the Settlement Report will be found a note on the subject of the rise in the prices of agricultural produce, together with a table showing the variations during the last forty years (1840\u201479). The inquiries extended over this period, or to about ten years before the previous assessment was fixed. The following statement shows the increase of the prices realized by agriculturists for the principal products during the last twenty years over those of the period of twenty years preceding it:\nBriefly stated, the history of the fluctuations is as follows. The Regular Settlement assessment was based on the prices of the few years preceding 1850, which were high; and its introduction was followed by a general fall. Prices continued very low till 1861, when famine sent them up; and they did not sink again to their old level. The scarcity of 1868-69, and the completion of the Sindh, Punjab and Delhi Railway through the district in 1870, which opened the local market to the demands of the whole of India and its seaports, together with the general progress of the country, finally established prices at their present level; and it is not probable that they will ever again recede. During the last twenty years they have on the whole been stationary; and, although this period includes four seasons of high prices (1862 and 1868 and the two years 1878 and 1879), this is not an abnormal number, nor is the actual average unreliable. The above statement shows that the average of the prices realized during the twenty years 1860\u201479 by the agriculturists for the ordinary staples of produce have been 50 per cent. or upwards in excess of those of the previous twenty years.\n\nThe division into assessment circles made at the Regular Settlement did not follow any rational principle; and the supposed necessity for adhering to the old parganah divisions made it practically useless. The Settlement Officer has now in each tahsil adopted the natural features of the country as the basis of his arrangement. The villages of the low-lying B\u00e9t tract were first separated off. The Ludhi\u00e1na B\u00e9t was rather too extensive for convenience; and, as there is a great difference in the produce of the upper and of the lower portions of it, a sub-division was necessary; while of the former it was necessary to throw into a separate class those villages which have land subject to annual inundation (mand or kachha), as the area is of greater extent here than elsewhere along the river, and differs widely from that part which is removed from the river (pucka). In the next place the villages in the strip of sandy soil along the Dha or ridge over the B\u00e9t could not come into the same class as those further inland; and were placed in a circle by themselves. In Samr\u00e1la and Jagraon the remainder of the tahsil was of so uniform a character that there was no necessity for sub-dividing it further. The uplands of Ludhi\u00e1na, however, stretch much further south than those of the other tahsils, and there is considerable diversity in the natural features. The outlying Jangal villages, with a small rainfall and no irrigation, naturally fell into a group by themselves; and as to the remaining\nportions there is so much difference between the south-western corner about Pakhow\u00e1l and the rich tract round Malaudh, that the separation of these was necessary; and there was left the upper portion, corresponding to that of the other tahsils.\n\nThe low lands in the valley of the Sutlej are everywhere known as B\u00e9t, while the land exposed to the direct action of the river is called kachha or mand. The uplands are generally spoken of as Dh\u00e1\u00eda or land beyond the high bank (Dha). The tract immediately over the B\u00e9t has been called Lower Dh\u00e1\u00eda, and that beyond it Upper, although the words lower and upper are not perhaps very appropriate. In Ludhi\u00e1na tahsil the terms Jangal and Paw\u00e1dh have been applied to the outlying villages and to the rich country about Malaudh respectively, while the tract round Pakhow\u00e1l has been termed Tih\u00e1ra, or intermediate between them. The names Lower and Upper Dh\u00e1\u00eda have been carried into the Jagraon tahsil for the sake of convenience. The assessment circles then are\u2014in Jagraon and Samr\u00e1la, B\u00e9t, Lower Dh\u00e1\u00eda and Upper Dh\u00e1\u00eda; and in Ludhi\u00e1na, three B\u00e9t circles, one of which is known as kachha and another as pucka, the Upper and Lower Dh\u00e1\u00eda, and the Paw\u00e1dh, Tih\u00e1ra, and Jangal circles.\n\nThe Samr\u00e1la B\u00e9t Circle contains 68 villages with a total area of 26,773 acres, of which 16,175 acres, or 60 per cent., are cultivated, 4,511 or 17 per cent. culturable or recently thrown out of cultivation, and 6,087 or 23 per cent. unculturable. It consists in the first place of the land (called mand) immediately adjoining the Sutlej and liable to annual inundation. The deposit left by the river is very fertilizing, and a rich clay soil is formed; but in places this is shallow and the under stratum of sand is soon reached. Beyond the mand the land is higher, and the soil of more ancient formation and deeper (generally three or four feet). Water is near the surface, and there is seldom lack of moisture, so that artificial irrigation is not wanted. The soil of this the pucka B\u00e9t is generally a rich dark clay, very fertile, but requiring a great deal of tillage. In places there are sand drifts left by the river, but these are rare. Under the high bank runs the Budha n\u00e1la in the old bed of the Sutlej. The land to the south of the Budha, between it and the high bank, is generally very good, as it rises away from the former, and the soil has a mixture of sand from the Dh\u00e1\u00eda. On the other side of the stream there is a strip of land rendered permanently barren by the proximity of the water, or actually swamped.\n\nOf the whole area 60 per cent. is in the hands of Muhammadan Jats; 23 per cent. of Muhammadan Rajputs; and five per cent. of Gujars; and it is much the worst feature of this circle that 88 per cent. of the land is held by the most improvident classes. Of the cultivated area 3,490, or 21 per cent., is held by tenants-at-will; and 1,336, or eight per cent., by tenants with occupancy right, or in all 30 per cent. of the cultivation is by tenants. The tenants belong for the most part to the same classes of the proprietors. The returns show that since the Regular Settlement two per cent. of the whole land has been sold, and that nearly eight per cent. is now in mortgage with possession of the mortgagee.\nThe percentages on cultivation are three sold, and twelve mortgaged; and it is probable that only cultivated or culturable land has been transferred. The average price of the land sold is Rs. 34 an acre; and the amount secured on mortgage, Rs. 33. The land transferred has gone almost entirely into the hands of strangers. Thus on the whole nearly ten per cent. of the total, or fifteen per cent. of the cultivated area has been transferred since the Regular Settlement; and most of it to the money-lending classes. These statistics are far from showing the whole indebtedness of the people. There are a few villages able to hold their own; but they are a small proportion of the whole. Some have gone entirely into the hands of the money-lenders, the land having been sold or being held in mortgage for such an amount that there is no chance of it ever being redeemed. There are colonies of bankers (Suds, Khatris, Banias) in M\u00e1chiw\u00e1r\u00e1 and Bahlolpur who live entirely by lending to the B\u00e9t cultivators; and many of these classes have established themselves in the villages (Panjgarien, Sherpur, &c.) The amount of money owed on book debts is enormous. It has been totalled up in some villages, and found to amount to Rs. 10 or 15 an acre. The villages are all small, averaging about 400 acres total area, and many are on the money-lenders' books for Rs. 5,000 or upwards. There can be no doubt that the tract is in a bad way; and that a large proportion of the land is passing out of the hands of the old proprietors into those of the money-lending class. There are many causes at work to produce this result.\n\nOwing to the high rate at which rents in kind are paid it was recognized that the assessment must, in the very depressed condition of the tract, be much under the produce estimate. The following statement shows the revenue rates finally adopted and their result:\n\n| Soil     | Area in acres | Revenue rate | Resulting Jama | Produce estimate | Former assessment |\n|----------|---------------|--------------|----------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Irrigated | 293           | Rs. As. P.   | Rs.            | Rs.              | Rs.              |\n| Dofaali   | 10,807        | 2 10 0       | 28,604         | 35,305           |                  |\n| Ekfaali   | 4,995         | 1 8 0        | 7,492          | 8,906            |                  |\n| Total     | 16,185        | 2 4 10       | 37,298         | 45,704           | 32,503           |\n\nThe calculated increase by these rates was 4,765 or 13 per cent.; but, owing to the necessity of assessing lightly new alluvial lands, it was expected that the village assessments would fall short of the sum. The assessments, former and new, and the result of the rates, were as follows:\n\n- Demand for 1880-81: Rs. 32,234\n- Assessment by the sanctioned rates: Rs. 38,468\n- Actually announced: Rs. 37,063\n\nThe actual enhancement was Rs. 3,829 or 12 per cent. This increase is a small one; and it was on the whole distributed evenly over the villages. It is not likely to make\nmuch difference in the condition of the tract; and, if regard be had to the productive power of the land, the new assessment is moderate, for the tract is a very fertile one. The greater part of the proprietors, and certainly all the Muhammadan Rajputs, are hopelessly involved in debt, and the only measure that could do them any good would be the suspension of the action of the ordinary Civil Courts.\n\nThe Lower Dh\u00e1ia Circle consists of certain Dh\u00e1ia villages whose lands extend into the B\u00e9t also, and therefore includes a certain area of B\u00e9t as well as of Dh\u00e1ia. The total area is 31,482 acres (contained in 30 villages), of which 25,035, or 79 per cent., are cultivated, 2,461 culturable or lately abandoned, 2,514 unculturable waste, and 1,472 Government property (land under the canal and roads). The B\u00e9t portion of the circle is for the most part very fertile, the land sloping down to the Budha n\u00e1la, where this stream is at a little distance from the high bank. The soil is generally lighter than that of the rest of the B\u00e9t, there being a mixture of sand from the Dh\u00e1ia with it, and produces without irrigation splendid crops of sugarcane and cotton. There is also some good irrigated cultivation. But to the east, about Po\u00e1wat and Bahloipur, the Budha is close under the high bank, and there is a great deal of swamp, the land being all to the north of the stream. The Dh\u00e1ia proper is a tract with an uneven surface and a light sandy soil, which shifts about under a strong wind, and is blown into hillocks. Ordinarily it has the appearance of a desert; but the soil is very retentive of moisture, and under favourable circumstances good crops are grown. The Khar\u00edf crop is mostly moth, for the growth of which the soil is adapted. With a light rainfall, when better land will bear nothing, fair R\u00e1b\u00ed crops of wheat, or wheat and gram, are grown; but they are liable to be buried under the shifting sand. A heavy rainfall, such as suits soils with more clay in them, is bad for this. Round the villages are the wells, and the land attached to them is generally superior and highly cultivated; but there is a continual struggle to keep out the drifting sand. For this purpose trees (the ber generally) are planted, or hedges put up as barriers. The worst villages are those adjoining the high bank. The surface in them is very hillocky, and the soil therefore more liable to shift. The villages adjoining the Upper Dh\u00e1ia circle have generally a more level surface; and, though the soil is poor, the crop is not so subject to injury from drift. But altogether the tract is an inferior one as regards natural advantages. Of the cultivated area of the Dh\u00e1ia 63 per cent. is classed as sand (bhir), and 30 per cent. as light loam (rausti), while only seven per cent. is irrigated.\n\nHindu Jats hold 49 per cent. of the area; Muhammadan Jats, 27 per cent.; and Muhammadan Rajputs, seven per cent. The Muhammadans are found in the villages on the high bank just over the B\u00e9t; and the character given to those in the B\u00e9t applies to them. The Hindu Jats are not so well-to-do as men of their class generally. They are for the most part industrious; but the soil is very inferior and yields but a poor return for their labour, and they find it difficult to subsist. Of the cultivated area 938 acres (3\u00bd\nper cent.) are held by tenants with rights of occupancy, and 6,226 (24\u00bd per cent.), by tenants-at-will; in all 7,164 acres, or 28 per cent. About six per cent. of the whole area has been sold since the Regular Settlement, and of this two-thirds to strangers of the money-lending class; while eight and a half per cent. is mortgaged with possession, three-fifths to strangers. The prices per acre are Rs. 18 for sale, and Rs. 15 secured by mortgage; and the low averages show that the land is not valued as an investment. There is not much debt outside of these figures, for money cannot be raised without the security of the land. Complaints are made very generally; and a good many of the villages are badly off. Discontent is general, and there can be no doubt that the tract is by no means in a flourishing condition, a result that may be attributed chiefly to the poverty of the soil. The assessment of the Settlement Officer in 1852 was not very well received; and was revised in 14 out of 30 villages by the Commissioner, who gave a reduction on the whole jama of 4\u00bd per cent.\n\nThe revenue rates finally sanctioned and their results are shown below:\n\n| Soil       | Area in acres | Rate | Resulting jama | Half asset estimated | Former assessment |\n|------------|---------------|------|----------------|---------------------|------------------|\n| B\u00e9t        |               |      |                |                     |                  |\n| Irrigated  | 173           | 4 8 0| 773            | 1,111               |                  |\n| Dofasli    | 2,275         | 3 0 0| 6,925          | 9,193               |                  |\n| Ekfaasi    | 948           | 1 12 0| 1,650          | 2,374               |                  |\n| Ch\u00e1hi      | 1,311         | 3 0 0| 3,923          | 4,771               |                  |\n| Dh\u00e1ia      |               |      |                |                     |                  |\n| Ramali     | 641           | 1 0 0| 6,411          | 5,074               |                  |\n| Bh\u00e1r       | 13,917        | 0 10 0| 8,698          | 8,359               |                  |\n| Total      | 25,035        | 1 2 1| 28,209         | 30,912              | 25,892            |\n\nThe above gives an increase of Rs. 2,407, or eight per cent. The assessments actually announced amounted to Rs. 28,154, and were well received. The tract is a very poor one; but the assessment was and still is very light; and there is some very good land in the villages adjoining the B\u00e9t, and again in those next to the Upper Dh\u00e1ia Circle.\n\nThe Samr\u00e1la Upper Dh\u00e1ia Circle contains 175 villages with a total area of 126,324 acres, of which 107,750, or 84 per cent., are cultivated; 8,627 culturable or recently out of cultivation; and 9,947, Government property or unculturable waste. It stretches south from the Lower Dh\u00e1ia in a plain of uniform surface except where two belts of sand, each of about one mile in width, run across it from north-east to south-west. The soil varies from a stiff clay to a light sand, the latter being found in the neighbourhood of these belts, and the former in depressions. The prevailing soil is a good loam, generally of dark colour, friable and most fertile. The percentages of soils according to our present classification are\u2014irrigated, 42; clay, 3; loam, 43; sand, 12.\nOf the revenue-paying area 80 per cent. belongs to Hindu Jats; 8\u00bd, to Muhammadan Rajputs; 2\u00bd, to Muhammadan Gujars; and 2\u00bd, to Muhammadan Jats. The Hindu Jats are a most industrious and thrifty class; and it is fortunate that the proportion of them is so large. The Muhammadan Rajputs are notorious for their improvidence; and are the worst possible revenue-payers. At the Regular Settlement this was fully recognized, and allowance was made in the assessments of their villages; but such consideration has not had much effect on their condition. They are, as a class, very much involved in debt; their villages contribute most of the area in the returns of sale and mortgage. The returns show one per cent. of the total area sold since the Regular Settlement, but nearly three-fourths of this has gone to coparceners. The average nominal price realized is Rs. 35 an acre. The land mortgaged with possession of the mortgagee amounts to four and a half per cent. of the whole, and of this nearly one-half is in the hands of members of the village community. The whole area transferred to the money-lending class proper by sale and mortgage is thus about two per cent. The amount secured per acre on usufructuary mortgage is Rs. 27. The inference to be drawn from these figures is that only a small portion of the land has changed hands, and that very little of it has gone to the money-lending class. The ordinary Jat is most tenacious of his land, and the price paid shows how it is valued.\n\nThe actual condition of the tract agrees with the result of these statistics. The people are uncommonly well-to-do, except in some of the Rajput villages where the thriftless habits of the land-owners are bringing them to ruin. But the money-lender has scarcely any hold at all on the Jats, nor is he ever likely to have more. There is a good deal of hard cash amongst them; and, if one of the number is in difficulties, he can always find some of his fellows to make an advance on the usufruct of a part of his land. There is of course a certain amount of floating debt; but this is no more than a couple of good harvests will clear off. If a money-lender has got a hold on the borrower he will insist on having the land and receiving a share of the produce; and it is a sure sign of the temporary nature of the debt when the land remains with the proprietor. There are not many external signs of prosperity such as one is led to expect from the experience of other districts. The people are very fond of their money, and waste none of it on show. The houses are neat, but have seldom any pretensions. A well-to-do Jat has no horse and not more cattle than he absolutely requires. He dresses very plainly, and spends little on the clothes and food of his family. His great aim is to get some more land into his hands; and he will keep his savings till a chance occurs of investing them in a mortgage. The best evidence of the prosperity of the agricultural population is that they can always dispose of their surplus produce to whom they like, and when they like. In most houses will be found stocks of grain or cotton more than sufficient for the use of the household, and kept in the hopes of a rise of prices. The gur is bought up from them as fast as it is made. They have not even the trouble of\ntaking their produce to market, for there is a keen competition between the traders, who go amongst the villages and buy on the spot. The Jats are careful to get a good price; and the margin of profit left to the trader is never excessive.\n\nThe new rates proposed by the Settlement Officer and the results of their application were:\n\n| Sot.       | Area   | Rate | Jama | Total |\n|------------|--------|------|------|-------|\n| Ni\u00e1l      | 16,049 | Rs A.P. | Rs    | Rs     |\n| Simple well | 28,791 | 3 8 0 | 1,00,763 | ... |\n| Other irrigation | 29 | 3 0 0 | 84 | ... |\n| Rasalli   | 49,536 | 1 6 0 | 68,112 | ... |\n| Bh\u00e1r      | 13,346 | 0 14 0 | 11,678 | 2,56,875 |\n\nThe assessment of the last year of the Regular Settlement, including nominal assessment of revenue-free grants, was Rs. 2,07,296; and the proposed assessment would have given an increase of Rs. 49,579 or 24 per cent. His Honor the Lieutenant-Governor, in sanctioning these rates, requested the Financial Commissioner to impress upon the Settlement Officer the necessity for treating with care and leniency those villages in which, from the small size of the holdings, an increase was likely to be felt, and His Honor further considered that 20 per cent. should be the maximum increase to be taken in the Circle. The actual results raised the assessment from Rs. 2,07,643 to Rs. 2,46,293, an increase of Rs. 38,650, or 19 per cent. This increase was somewhat under that directed; but it was found that there were several Muhammadan villages in which the Settlement Officer had to go very far below rates. With the exception of these villages the enhancement was evenly distributed over the tract, and the new assessments were well received.\n\nThe first Circle for consideration in the Ludhi\u00e1na tahsil is the mand or strip of land along the bank of the river; and in this have been included only the villages of which the greater part of the area is liable to annual inundation. The Circle contains 15 villages with an area of 8,757 acres, of which only 2,677, or 30 per cent., are cultivated; 3,487 or 39 per cent. culturable; and 480 or 5 per cent. lately abandoned. The remainder, 26 per cent., is unculturable. The small proportion of cultivated area to culturable and barren is not to be wondered at in a tract like this. The uncultivable is sand along or in the bed of the river, and the culturable is the ordinary new land found on its banks, covered with a growth of pilchi or of reeds. Most of this will eventually be cultivated, unless destroyed by the river. The land of this Circle is nearly all liable to annual inundation: and people live in adjoining villages of the pucka B\u00e9t, and sometimes in a corner of their own, as the land is under water during most of the hot weather. The silt left by the overflow of the river is generally very fertilizing, and the land is really renewed annually. The soil is a clay-loam on a substratum of sand. When the deposit has attained a depth of nine inches to a foot, the plough can be worked in it without bringing up the sand, and cultivation is possible. But good crops cannot be\ngrown unless the sand is from one to three feet distant from the surface, the further the better.\n\nThe land is held by the various tribes, thus: Muhammadan Rajputs, 57 per cent; Muhammadan Gujars, 10 per cent; Muhammadan Jats, 14 per cent; Hindu Lobanas and Binjaras, 16 per cent; others, 3 per cent. The Muhammadans are not well suited to the ups and downs of an alluvial circle, but they are fairly well-to-do. The Binjaras engage a good deal in trade, and do not depend entirely on cultivation. Of the total area less than one per cent. has been sold since the Regular Settlement, and eight per cent. is now held in mortgage. The price in the case of sale is Rs. 40 an acre, and the mortgaged money per acre Rs. 17. The whole area mortgaged has gone to money-lenders; but it is made up almost entirely by one Rajput village, of which the whole land has been mortgaged. With the exception of this one village the Circle is in good condition. The produce is excellent and the people keep out of debt, and are generally well-to-do. But they are of course liable to lose their land any year from the action of the river. The Regular Settlement gave a large reduction on the jama of the Summary Assessment, and was 20 per cent. under rates. The present assessment is very light.\n\nThe following statement shows the rates sanctioned and their result as compared with the produce estimate:\n\n| Soil       | Area   | Rate | Resulting assessment | Half asset estimate |\n|------------|--------|------|----------------------|--------------------|\n| Irrigated | 24     | Rs. A.P. | 90                  | 141                |\n| Dofasli    | 1,283  |      | 3,558                | 4,798              |\n| Ekfaali    | 1,370  |      | 2,307                | 2,868              |\n| Total      |        |      | 6,045                | 7,797              |\n\nAs in Samrala it was expected that the village assessments would fall short of the above total on account of new land favourably assessed; and, in the case of the land included in the kachha chak, or area liable to annual assessment, dofasli rates of Rs. 2-10-0 and Rs. 1-10-0 were to be applied instead of the full rates. The assessment announced and reported amounted to Rs. 4,900, as against a total by rates of 5,039, there having been considerable changes in the area of the report as in the case of Samrala; and the enhancement on the demand of the last year, Rs. 4,049, was 21 per cent.\n\nBet I Pucka comprises the rest of the villages of the Bet portion of Bhartgarh and Sahnewal parganahs. It contains 57 villages with a total area of 32,048 acres, of which 21,237, or 66 per cent., are cultivated; 8,078, or 25 per cent., culturable or lately abandoned; and 2,733, or nine per cent., barren waste. Part of the land of one or two villages is in the mand and subject to inundation, but with this exception the tract lies high, beyond the direct influence of the river. Towards the high bank, too, very few villages adjoin the Budha nala, which runs for the most part through the\nB\u00e9t portion of the Lower Dh\u00e1ia circle. There are a good many n\u00e1las or streams running across the tract, which fill in the rains, but seldom overflow their banks. The soil, like that of B\u00e9t lands generally, is a stiff dark clay-loam on a substratum of sand, very fertile when properly cultivated. The water level is near the surface, and there is always abundance of moisture. In places there is tendency to kallar; but this is not common, and land so affected is mostly uncultivated. Sand ridges occur, but the sand does not shift. The stratum of clay is shallow here and there and the sand appears on the surface; but, as a rule, the clay reaches to five or six feet below the surface. Irrigation is everywhere easy, water being found at a depth of eight to twelve feet, and there is more of it than in Samr\u00e1la B\u00e9t. The proportion of irrigated land is five per cent. of the cultivated area of the whole Circle; but it lies mostly in the villages to the west. In the eastern part, as in the Samr\u00e1la B\u00e9t, irrigation is not required, and superior or dofasti cultivation is carried on in the unirrigated land.\n\nOf the whole area 93 per cent. is held by Muhammadans, thus:\u2014R\u00e1jp\u00fats, 22; Gujars, 34; Jats, 19; Ar\u00e1iens, 7; others, 11. The \"others\" are made up of Aw\u00e1ns and Sai\u00e1ds principally. The Hindus, who hold seven per cent., are mostly Lob\u00e1nas. The R\u00e1jp\u00fats are bad husbandmen, and do not willingly cultivate their own land. The Jats and Gujars are more industrious and well-to-do. The condition of the tract is better than that of the Samr\u00e1la B\u00e9t, a result that may be attributed principally to the small area under sugarcane cultivation, for where cane is grown the cultivator is driven to the money-lender. There is no such eagerness here on the part of the money-lenders to make advances to the agriculturists; and the latter are more thrown on their own resources, and, as a rule, incur debt only when compelled to do so for a marriage, on account of a bad harvest, or for some such cause. They ordinarily live on the grain that they grow themselves. Some of the villages, such as Kari\u00e1n\u00e1, Baliew\u00e1l, &c., are very prosperous; and few are really much involved, though proprietors in most will be found in debt. It cannot, on the other hand, be said that there is a great deal of wealth in the Circle. The wheat and cotton are mostly sold; and good prices are realized for vegetables, which are bought by traders from the city, and for straw sometimes. The proportion of the agricultural population who are well-to-do, and can dispose of their own surplus produce when they like, is considerable; but not nearly so large as in the Dh\u00e1ia. Such money as may be saved is generally kept in hard cash or invested in land. There is no display of brass dishes, &c., for the Muhammadans do not use them; and only sufficient cattle are kept for the use of the household, except by the Gujars, who dispose of the milk and gh\u00ed produced by their buffaloes and cows.\n\nOf the total area one and a half per cent. has been sold since the Regular Settlement, and six and a half per cent. is now in mortgage. Of the sales 33 per cent. are to agriculturists, and of the mortgages 50 per cent., so that the area transferred since the Regular Settle-\nment to the money-lending classes is less than five per cent. on total area, and six and a half per cent. on cultivation. The average price per acre is for sale Rs. 46, and for mortgage Rs. 34. There is a good deal of money owed on book accounts, as might be expected from the character of the people, for Muhammadans seldom get on without the assistance of the money-lender; but the debt of this sort is not nearly so great as in the Samr\u00e1la B\u00e9t, nor does it press very hard.\n\nThe rates sanctioned for this Circle and the resulting assessments are:\n\n| Soil       | Area   | Rate | Resulting Jama | Half asset estimate |\n|------------|--------|------|----------------|---------------------|\n| Irrigated  | 1,118  | Rs. A. P. | 4,192          | 6,051               |\n| Dofasli    | 7,016  |      | 17,540         | 21,488              |\n| Ekfasli    | 13,103 |      | 18,836         | 22,704              |\n| **TOTAL**  | **...**|      | **40,568**     | **50,243**          |\n\nThere are some villages in this Circle, too, with new alluvial land which had to be assessed favourably; and the assessments announced gave a total of Rs. 41,519, being an enhancement of 20 per cent. on the demand of the last year (Rs. 34,207), and the jama given by rates for the year of announcement being 41,602.\n\nAssessment Circle B\u00e9t II is the western part of the Ludhi\u00e1na B\u00e9t, and includes nearly the whole of parganah N\u00farpur. It is about twelve miles in length and four in breadth, and contains 67 villages with a total area of 41,305 acres, of which 26,121, or 63 per cent., are cultivated. There has been a loss by diluvion since the Regular Settlement of 14 per cent. of the total area, and some villages have lost almost the whole of their land. A Kachha Circle was not separated off, because there is very little good mand. The soil of B\u00e9t II is for the most part much inferior to that of B\u00e9t I (Pucka), and the rainfall is considerably less. The Budha n\u00e1la is the boundary of the Circle to the south, and joins the river just outside it, so that all the land on the north bank of this stream is included. This is in parts very inferior, being either unfit for cultivation, or yielding very poor crops and that not every year. Kallar is more prevalent than in the eastern B\u00e9t, and barren patches are to be found in the best wheat fields, especially about N\u00farpur. As in B\u00e9t I irrigation is easy, water being at about the same depth. The proportion of irrigated land is nine per cent. of the cultivation.\n\nThe land is thus distributed amongst the agricultural classes:\u2014Muhammadan Gujars, 44 per cent.; Muhammadan R\u00e1jp\u00fats, 10 per cent.; Muhammadan Ar\u00e1iens, 10 per cent.; Muhammadan Aw\u00e1ns, 11 per cent.; Muhammadan Dogars, 10 per cent.; Hindus, 4 per cent.; others, 11 per cent. Gujars predominate as proprietors. The Ar\u00e1iens are very common as tenants, besides cultivating a large proportion as proprietors. The Aw\u00e1ns and Ar\u00e1iens are as a rule well-to-do; and so are the Gujars in the villages away from the river and near the city.\nThe tract is for the most part in fairly good condition. The villages on the margin of the river, which belong mostly to Gujars, have lost a great deal of land; and the proprietors have become involved on this account. But there are a number of first-rate villages removed from the river with a great deal of irrigated land, belonging to all classes of proprietors. The people of these derive great benefit from the proximity of Ludhi\u0101na, where they have a ready market for their produce of all sorts, and whence they can obtain a plentiful supply of manure. The Regular Settlement gave a small reduction on the Summary assessment. The revenue has been realized without any difficulty, except in one or two of the Gujar villages along the river, which have suffered most from its action. The returns show three and a half per cent. of the total area (or five and a half of the cultivated area) sold since Settlement, and four and a half (or seven of cultivation) held in mortgage now. The prices per acre are Rs. 37 for sale and Rs. 29 for mortgage, the price per rupee of Government demand being much the same as in B\u00e9t I. Of the land sold two-thirds has gone to agriculturists, and one-third of the mortgaged land is held by them. Thus the proportion of land transferred to outsiders is four and a half of the total, or six per cent. of the cultivated area.\n\nThe rates sanctioned and the resulting assessments are as follows:\n\n| Soil       | Area   | Rate | Resulting assessment | Half asset estimate |\n|------------|--------|------|----------------------|---------------------|\n| Irrigated | 2,454  | Rs. A. P | 9,202               | 11,036              |\n| Dofaali    | 1,468  | 1 10 0 | 2,369               | 2,994               |\n| Ekfaali    | 22,209 | 1 4 0 | 27,761              | 33,428              |\n| Total      |        |      | 39,332              | 43,458              |\n\nWhen the assessment given by the rates came to be distributed over the villages of this Circle it was found that, even after making allowance for the new alluvial lands, the rates gave higher jamas than could be taken; and those finally reported amounted to 35,535 as against a rate jama of 36,738, which was still an actual increase of 23 per cent. on the last year's demand of 28,288.\n\nThe Lower Dh\u00e1ia Circle of Ludhi\u0101na is a continuation of that of Samr\u00e1la, and a detailed description of it is not necessary. It extends for the whole breadth of the tahsil, and contains 78 villages with a total area of 73,604 acres, of which 79 per cent. is cultivation. The Dh\u00e1ia portion is much better than that of Samr\u00e1la, because several fine villages have been included, and the percentage of irrigation and good soils is as follows: irrigated, 7\u00bd; rausli, 6\u00bd; while bh\u016br is only 30 per cent.\n\nThe crops and husbandry of the Dh\u00e1ia portion are the same as in Samr\u00e1la, while in the B\u00e9t lands they agree with those described for the Pucka B\u00e9t Circles of Ludhi\u0101na. The land is divided thus between the various agricultural tribes: Muhammadan R\u0101jp\u016bts, 30 per cent.; Muhammadan Gujars, 9 per cent.; Muhammadan Ar\u0101iens,\n4 per cent.; Muhammadan Jats, 3 per cent.; Muhammadan Aw\u00e1ns, 6 per cent.; other Muhammadans, 6 per cent.; Hindu Jats, 35 per cent.; other Hindus, 7 per cent. The Muhammadans hold the villages along the high bank, those with land in B\u00e9t and Dh\u00e1\u00eda; and the Hindus, those adjoining the Upper Dh\u00e1\u00eda.\n\nSome of the large villages along the high bank belonging to R\u00e1jp\u00fats are in very bad condition. The lands of these (both B\u00e9t and Dh\u00e1\u00eda) are not very good, and the cultivation poor; but the assessment is extremely light, and it is entirely owing to the thriftless habits of the proprietors that they are in such a state. The Hindu Jat, Aw\u00e1n and Ar\u00e1ien villages are all well conditioned, and there is little complaint of debt in most of them. But the tract does not enjoy many natural advantages; and is, as a whole, the worst off in the tahsil. The assessment of the Regular Settlement was a considerable increase on that of the Summary Settlement; but it was realized without trouble, except in one or two villages where the lambard\u00e1rs are themselves in difficulties. On the whole, though some of the Dh\u00e1\u00eda lands are very inferior, the condition of the Circle is not really bad. Of the total area three per cent. has been sold since the Regular Settlement, but three-fourths of this has gone to agriculturists; while seven and a half per cent. is now held in mortgage, half of it by the money-lending classes. The prices realized are Rs. 45 an acre on sale, and Rs. 28 on mortgage. The land sold and mortgaged is mostly in the Dh\u00e1\u00eda. In the returns are included two whole villages (one sold and one mortgaged); and this has run up the area. There is a good deal of book debt; and the R\u00e1jp\u00fat and Gujar villages more especially owe large sums. Land has a very good price.\n\nThe rates sanctioned and the resulting assessments are shown in the following statement. The Settlement Officer was directed in the orders sanctioning the rates to go above them and to take up to a 10 per cent. enhancement if it appeared prudent to do so:\n\n| Soil       | Area | Rate | Resulting jama | Half assets estimate |\n|------------|------|------|----------------|---------------------|\n| B\u00e9t        |      |      |                |                     |\n| Irrigated | 1,439| Rs A.P. 3 12 0 | 5,393              | 6,874               |\n| Dofasli    | 2,675| 2 4 0 | 6,018            | 7,075               |\n| Efkasli    | 6,530| 1 4 0 | 8,162            | 7,694               |\n| N\u00ed\u00e1i ch\u00e1hi | 2,444| 3 8 0 | 8,554            | 11,250              |\n| Kh\u00e1lis ch\u00e1hi | 1,169| 2 8 0 | 2,922            | 3,380               |\n| Ran\u00e1li     | 29,933| 1 2 0 | 33,674           | 30,454              |\n| Bh\u00far       | 14,500| 0 12 0 | 10,882           | 9,612               |\n| Dh\u00e1\u00eda      |      |      |                |                     |\n| Total      |      | 1 4 1 | 75,608           | 76,540              |\nNo difficulty was experienced in taking a total assessment of 80,100 as against an assessment by rates of 79,341*; an enhancement of 10 per cent. on the last year's jama of 71,404.\n\nThe Upper Dh\u00e1ia Circle contains 117 villages with a total area of 1,08,145 acres, of which 95,135, or 88 per cent., are cultivated. It is the central portion of the tahsil, stretching right across it. The greatest length from east to west is 22 miles, and the breadth varies from 2 to 12. The tract does not differ much in character from the Samr\u00e1la Upper Dh\u00e1ia. The soil is generally somewhat lighter, and the surface cut up more irregularly by sand ridges; but stretches of as good loam as any in Samr\u00e1la occur, and the proportion of actually inferior soil is not quite so great. The water level lies at about the same depth (40 feet), and irrigation is quite as easy. The proportion of irrigation is less here than in Samr\u00e1la (22 as against 42 per cent.); and there is not so much high cultivation. But the unirrigated lands at all events are equal to those of Samr\u00e1la, perhaps even better adapted to dry cultivation. The proportion of irrigation, rausli and bh\u00far are: irrigated, 22 per cent.; rausli, 63 per cent.; bh\u00far, 17 per cent.\n\nThe proportions of land held by the various agricultural tribes are:\u2014Hindu Jats, 86 per cent.; other Hindus, 8 per cent.; Muhammadan Jats, 3 per cent.; others, 3 per cent. Of the Hindu Jats the Garew\u00e1l got hold 26 per cent. of the whole area of the Circle, the rest being divided between the Gil, Sekhon, Dhilon and other gots. The Garew\u00e1ls are probably not much inferior as cultivators to the others, but more given to extravagance. Most of the land of the Circle therefore belongs to the best class of agriculturists. The cultivating percentages are: by proprietors cultivating their own land, 76; by occupancy tenants, 4; by tenants-at-will, 20. The land under tenants-at-will is thus made up: by mortgagors cultivating their own land, 2\u00bd; by proprietors of other land, 9\u00bc; by tenants who have no proprietary or occupancy rights, 8.\n\nOf the total area two per cent. has been sold to agriculturists since the Regular Settlement, most of it (five-eighths) within the village; and only one half per cent. has gone to money-lenders. The proportion of area mortgaged is four per cent. to money-lenders; and of this about one-third is without possession of the mortgagee. The total transfers amount to two and a half per cent. sold since Regular Settlement; and eight per cent. now in mortgage. In such a large Circle it might be expected that the condition of all villages would not be alike. Some are weak, either on account of inferior soil, or because the people have got into debt in bad years and have not been able to extricate themselves. One or two villages were disorganized in the Summary Settlement, and had their land transferred. But the tenacity with which it has been held by the purchasers, and the constant attempts of the original\n\n---\n\n* The difference between this amount and the figures of the above Statement is due to subsequent transfers of villages.\nowners to recover it, show how much it is valued. The great majority of the villages are strong communities, perfectly self-dependent. The proprietors seldom owe more money than they could pay off with a slight effort; and they are able to dispose of their surplus produce themselves in Ludhiana, and watch the market quite as keenly as the ordinary trader does. The dwellings present generally an appearance of prosperity; and there is more display of it than in Samr\u0101la. Good houses, good cattle, brass dishes, jewelry are the signs of wealth to be looked for, and they are generally to be found. Most houses have a store of grain, the produce of one harvest being kept till the next one is secure, unless very high prices tempt it out. Large sums of money are spent on marriages and funerals, extravagance of this sort being greatly on the increase. Altogether there are unmistakable signs that the tract has thriven under the former assessment, which gave a slight reduction in the villages that had been summarily assessed, and has been collected without any trouble at all.\n\nThe following statement gives the rates finally adopted for this Circle and their results:\n\n| Soil       | Area   | Rate | Resulting Jama | Half asset estimate |\n|------------|--------|------|----------------|---------------------|\n| N\u012b\u0101i ch\u0101hi | 12,437 | Rs.

P 4 8 0 | 56,166 | 65,715 |\n| Kh\u0101lia ch\u0101hi | 8,170 | 3 4 0 | 24,602 | 30,442 |\n| D\u0101kbar and Kau\u1e63\u0101l\u012b | 60,196 | 1 6 0 | 62,770 | 65,158 |\n| Bh\u016br       | 14,332 | 0 14 0 | 12,541 | 12,469 |\n| Total      |        |      | 1,78,629 | 2,00,784 |\n\nThe assessments announced amounted to Rs. 1,70,639, the result of the rates after such alteration in the limits of the Circle as it was necessary to make being Rs. 1,71,212, and the increase 17 per cent. on the previous demand.*\n\nCircle Paw\u0101dh contains 39 villages with a total area of 34,972 acres, of which 27,332 or 78 per cent. are cultivated, and 5,867 or 16 p.c., culturable or recently abandoned. It embraces the upper part of parganah Malaudh; and is held in j\u0101g\u012br by the Sard\u0101rs of Malaudh, with the exception of three or four villages. There are two outlying villages attached to the Circle. The Paw\u0101dh does not materially differ from the Upper Dh\u0101ia, except that the soil is generally harder, containing more clay, and better adapted to irrigated than to unirrigated cultivation. There are one or two sand drifts, and lighter soil in their neighbourhood; but a stiff loam of dark colour predominates. The water level is closer to the surface, being generally at a depth of about 30 feet. Irrigation from wells covers 29 per cent. of the cultivation. The average population per square mile of cultivation (630) is much higher than in any other Circle of the tahsil; and only a little lower than that in Upper Dh\u0101ia Samr\u0101la.\n\n* See footnote to last page. An interchange of villages between these two Circles was found necessary.\nOf the total area 94 per cent. belongs to Hindu Jats of the Bhandar and miscellaneous gots. They are a most industrious and thrifty race; and no other tract can show such a large proportion of good cultivators. Even amongst Jats the people of the Paw\u00e1dh are noted for their industry. Proprietors cultivate 82; occupancy tenants, 2; and tenants-at-will, 16 per cent. of the area.\n\nThe returns show that of the whole area one and a half per cent. has been sold since the Regular Settlement, while seven per cent. is now held in mortgage. About one-half of the sales have been to other members of the village community, and only a third to non-agriculturists. About one-quarter of the mortgages are without possession of the mortgagee, while the whole of these and about half the mortgages with possession are to money-lenders. The people have by their thrift and industry attained a condition of great prosperity; and the villages are almost without exception held by strong independent communities. In fact there is no village that can be said to be badly off; while some are notorious as containing great wealth. The proprietors dispose of their produce either to traders on the spot, or take it to Ludhi\u00e1na, and there is not much debt of any sort. The villages were not assessed in the Summary Settlement, but paragraph 10 of Mr. Barnes' Review gives the following details for the whole j\u00e1gir, that is this and the Jangal Circle:\n\n| J\u00e1gird\u00e1rs' estimate of their collections | ... | 1,15,938 |\n| Regular Settlement assessment | ... | 74,950 |\n\nThe j\u00e1gird\u00e1rs took in grain and in cash; and their estimate was naturally exaggerated, though not very much; and there is no doubt that they took the equivalent of nearly half as much again as the Regular Settlement assessment. The rates at which they made their collections were little, if anything, under proprietors' rates; and the Regular Settlement assessment gave a reduction of nearly two-fifths on these.\n\nThe following is a statement of the sanctioned rates and the results:\n\n| Soil | Area | Rate | Resulting assessment | Half asset estimate |\n|------|------|------|----------------------|---------------------|\n| Ni\u00e1\u00ed ch\u00e1hi | 6,649 | 4-2-0 | 27,427 | 28,879 |\n| Kh\u00e9lis ch\u00e1hi | 1,341 | 3-0-0 | 4,023 | 4,145 |\n| Rauall and D\u00e1khar... | 16,228 | 1-4-0 | 20,285 | 21,776 |\n| Bh\u00e1r | 3,114 | 0-13-0 | 2,530 | 2,577 |\n| Total | ... | ... | 54,265 | 57,377 |\n\nThe assessments actually announced amounted to 54,360, an enhancement of 22 per cent.\n\nThe Tih\u00e1ra Circle contains 57 villages with a total area of 66,112 acres, of which 59,167 or 90 per cent. are cultivated. It\nis the south-west corner of the upper part of the tahsil, and comprises the whole of parganah Pakhowal, and some villages of Ghungrana. The natural features of the Circle do not differ very much from those of Upper Dhaina. The soil is somewhat lighter, and although the water-level is nearer to the surface (about 35 feet generally), irrigation is not so common, only 15 per cent. of the cultivation being irrigated. Of the unirrigated area 78 per cent. is good soil (that is dakh or rouli), and 22 per cent. bhur or sand. There is no proper record of the rainfall; but it may be taken as two or three inches less than that of the last two Circles. The present density of the population is 493 to the square mile of cultivation.\n\nOf the land of the Circle 84 per cent. is cultivated by proprietors, 2 per cent. by occupancy tenants, and 14 per cent. by tenants-at-will. Hindu Jats own 78 per cent. of the area; and there are one or two Rajput villages, this tribe having 9 per cent. of the whole land. The principal gots of Hindu Jats are Garewal (13 per cent.), Dhaliwal (10 per cent.), Bhandher (4 per cent.). The Rajputs of the Circle are perhaps worse than their class, generally, more thriftless and worse cultivators. Most of the villages are in very good condition, being in the hands of large and strong communities. The Rajputs are in debt; but the Jats are well-to-do, and as a rule independent of the money-lender. A succession of good harvests, and the high prices now realized for the inferior grains grown in unirrigated land, have brought a great deal of wealth into the Circle; and in every village some of the proprietors are engaged in trade and own carts or camels which they ply for hire. Numbers too are in the service of our Government or of the Native States about. The houses are well built and comfortable, and generally contain good stores of grain and cash. It was not found necessary to give much reduction of assessment in the Regular Settlement (about 3 per cent.); and the present jama has been collected without any difficulty. Of the total area three-quarters per cent. is shown as sold since Regular Settlement, and of this most has gone to agriculturists. The registration returns, which are up to date, give a much larger area, amounting to one and a half per cent. of the whole. The area now held in mortgage is four and a half per cent., with possession of mortgagee and one per cent. without possession. Of the former about one-third is to outsiders and two-thirds to agriculturists. The price of land sold is Rs. 72, while the average money secured on mortgage with possession is Rs. 37. For sale the price per rupee of Government revenue is Rs. 50, and for mortgage Rs. 26. The price realized for land in this Circle is by the returns higher than in any other, and there can be no doubt that this is the sort of land that has most attractions to an investor.\n\nThe following is a statement of the revenue rates sanctioned for this Circle, with the results on the figures of the Assessment Report:\u2014\nThe assessments announced amounted to 95,998, the jama by rates being, after the transfer of two or three villages from the Upper Dh\u00e1ia Circle, 96,073, and the enhancement 20 per cent.\n\nThe Jangal Circle contains 29 villages with a total area of 69,026 acres, of which 59,208 or 85 per cent. are cultivated, and 7,479 or 11 per cent., culturable. The villages are all held in j\u00e1g\u00edr by the Malaundh family, and lie to the south of the Jagraon tahsil in detached groups surrounded by N\u00e1bha and Pati\u00e1la territory. The distance from Khi\u00e1li, the most northern village, to Bhaini Chuhar, the most southern, is nearly 40 miles. The latter is more than half way from the boundary of Jagraon tahsil to that of the Sirs\u00e1 district. The principal groups are those of Sahna and Dhap\u00e1li, which are adjacent and between them contain 21 villages. Sahna may be taken as the centre of the tract, and it is 24 miles from the nearest point of Tih\u00e1ra Circle. The villages are very large, averaging 2,300 acres of total area; and the sites are at great distances from each other. This, with the uneven character of the surface and the absence of irrigation, gives the country rather a wild appearance, although there is really little more waste land than in any part of the district. In places great ridges of sand occur, but they are not common; and the soil is generally a good loam, sometimes with a considerable mixture of clay. The returns give the proportion of bh\u00edr or sand to good soil as 13 : 87. There is a little irrigation in the first two villages of the Circle; and there was some formerly in a village of the Sahna group, but the latter has been given up as unprofitable. Water is found at a depth of 75 to 130 feet; and is with considerable difficulty raised in the wells round the village sites which are used for drinking purposes. The Sirhind canal, already under construction as far as Sahna, passes through three villages of the Sahna group; and it is probable that every village in the Circle will within a few years be reached by some of the distributaries.\n\nOf the cultivated area only 8 per cent is held by tenants, who mostly pay in kind. Hindu Jats held 86, and other Hindus, 9 per cent of the area. The people of the Jangal villages are a very fine race. They have little labour to do in the fields, and spend their spare time profitably in moving about and picking up what they can by trade, while a great many of them take service in the army.\nNo part of the district has such a reputation for prosperity as this Circle. The people of the more highly cultivated parts are never weary of telling one what immense profits the Jangal zamindars are making, and what an abundance of land there is; and there can be no doubt that a succession of good seasons, and the great demand for the inferior grains which are the principal staples, together with the trading habits of the people, have raised the general condition of the tract within the last ten or fifteen years much more, comparatively, than that of any other. There is every sign of prosperity in the Circle. The houses are large and comfortable, the cattle superior to those of any other parts, and a large proportion of the proprietors own carts or camels with which they go all over the country, disposing of their own grain or carrying for hire. It is for this purpose that such high class cattle are kept, for inferior ones would do for agriculture. Perhaps the way in which money is now spent on marriage and other celebrations is the best proof of the profits made by cultivation. It is not uncommon for a Jat of these parts to expend Rs. 500 to Rs. 1,000 on such an occasion, and cases will be found where Rs. 1,500 had been wasted in this manner by proprietors of ordinary means. Of course this is extravagance, and often leads to debt; but still it betokens the presence of wealth.\n\nThe area returned as sold since the Regular Settlement is very small (about one-third per cent). The area mortgaged is ten per cent. of the whole area, but of the six per cent. is to agriculturists of the village, and two and a half to non-agriculturists; while eight and a half per cent. is mortgaged with possession of mortgagee; and one and a half per cent. without possession. The latter is all to money-lenders. It has elsewhere been remarked that land was often mortgaged where there was no real necessity, and this is the case with the greater part of the mortgages in this Circle to fellow-sharers of the village. The mortgage is sometimes merely a form of tenure, the proprietor being unwilling or unable to cultivate himself, and the mortgagee paying down a lump sum for the right of cultivation, which he retains till the money is repaid. The price of the land sold averages Rs. 38 an acre, or Rs. 79 per rupee of Government revenue, but the area on which the average is calculated is small. The average per acre of mortgage money is Rs. 30, or Rs. 60 per rupee of Government demand. These prices are, comparatively with the revenue demand, higher than in any other Circle, and absolutely higher than in most. The people have been able to tide over any failures of harvest that have occurred during the currency of the Regular Settlement, and to pay their revenue punctually in the worst years. This they do from their stores of grain; for experience has taught them foresight to an extent that is not required in more favoured tracts, and in the possession of most proprietors will be found sufficient grain for at the very least a year's food. The amount stored at any time will depend on the state of the market, for the people can always wait for favourable prices; but it is never reduced below this until the next harvest is insured, which may be before it is cut. The failure of a single harvest, though it may\ncripple the resources of the tract temporarily can have no permanent effect. The failure of two harvests, that is a Kharif and Rabt in succession, would be more severely felt. The first result would be a great loss of cattle, many either dying or being sold for next to nothing; and this is what actually happened in the droughts of 1862 and 1868. Besides suffering a great loss of cattle, many of the people would have after a time to incur debt for their own living. Since 1868 there has been a succession of good seasons, very few having been below the average; and this with high prices has not only removed the traces of previous bad years but has raised the Circle to its present state of prosperity.\n\nThe rates sanctioned for this Circle and their results are as follows:\n\n| Soil     | Area   | Rate | Resulting assessment | Half asset estimate |\n|----------|--------|------|----------------------|---------------------|\n| Irrigated | 91     | Rs. A P. 1 6 0 | 125                  | 401                 |\n| Rausli    | 52,314 | 0 11 0 | 35,966               | 47,705              |\n| Bhur      | 6,803  | 0 8 0 | 3,401                | 4,459               |\n| Total     |        |      | 39,492               | 52,565              |\n\nThese sanctioned rates gave an increase of about 39 per cent.; but the actual enhancement was restricted to 33 per cent. on the former jama, and the assessments actually announced, which amounted to 38,265, gave this proportion.\n\nThe B\u00e9t Circle of Jagraon contains 18 villages with a total area of 15,998 acres, of which 9,924 acres or 62 per cent. are cultivated; 4,239 or 26 per cent., barren waste; and the remaining 12 per cent., culturable or recently thrown out of cultivation. To the east for about six miles the river runs at some distance from the high bank; and between them lies a tract three or four miles wide, similar to the Ludhi\u00e1na B\u00e9t, having some land annually inundated, and the rest beyond the direct action of the river (kachcha or mand and pucka). From Bhundri westward the Dh\u00e1ia and river are only about a mile apart, and the floods reach almost right up to the former, while the villages are large, and their lands stretch from the river several miles south of the high bank. There are none of these entirely in the B\u00e9t, and a few have been thrown into the Circle, although they have Dh\u00e1ia lands also. In the western villages there is very little pucka B\u00e9t land. The Budha n\u00e1la runs through the eastern part of the Circle, and joins the river a mile to the west of Bhundri. Its banks are high, and it does no harm to the land, which is cultivated right up to them.\n\nThe land-owners belong to the various tribes in the following proportions: Guj\u00e1r, 39 per cent.; R\u00e1jp\u00fat, 28 per cent.; Ara\u00e9n, 15 per cent.; other Muhammadans, 8 per cent.; Hindu Jats, 7 per cent.; others, 3 per cent. Of the whole cultivation 31 per cent. is by tenants, and 69 per cent. by proprietors. The land under tenants is thus divided: held with rights of occupancy, 7 per cent.;\ncultivated by tenants who have rights of occupancy or ownership in other land, 11 per cent.; cultivated by tenants who have no such rights, 13 per cent. A large proportion of the land is in the hands of Rajputs and Gujars; and, as in the Bet tracts of the other tahsils, there is a good deal of debt, incurred principally from want of thrift. But there are a great many well-to-do families in all three tribes (Rajputs, Gujars, Ariens); and some of the villages are in very good condition. The land just over the high bank is the poorest in the tahsil; and most of the Dh\u00e1ia villages have also land exposed to the direct action of the river, and therefore not always to be relied on. Some have suffered a good deal by loss of land, and this is a sure cause of debt; but on the whole the Circle may be said to be in fairly good condition. The patw\u00e1ris' papers show one and a half per cent. sold since Regular Settlement, and ten per cent. (of the total area) as now held in mortgage with possession of the mortgagee. The proportion mortgaged to money-lenders is small (two per cent. of the whole area). Nearly half of the area shown as mortgaged to agriculturists of other villages is in one single village.\n\nThe revenue rates sanctioned for this Circle and the estimated results of their application were as follows:\n\n| Soil       | Area | Rate | Resulting jama | Half asset estimate |\n|------------|------|------|----------------|-------------------|\n| Bet        |      |      |                |                   |\n| Irrigated  | 287  | Rs. As. P. | 1,076 | 1,686 |\n| Dofasli    | 2,963 | 2 0 0 | 4,526 | 5,200 |\n| Ekfaasli   | 3,586 | 1 4 0 | 4,483 | 4,170 |\n| Ch\u00e1hi      | 91   | 3 0 0 | 273   | 488   |\n| Rauli      | 250  | 1 0 0 | 259   | 318   |\n| Bh\u00e1r       | 3,438 | 0 10 0 | 2,149 | 2,002 |\n| Total      |      |      | 12,766 | 14,824 |\n\nAs in other Bet Circles the area to which the rates were actually applied differed from that in the Assessment Report, and the total of the village assessments announced was Rs. 11,364 (the rate jama being Rs. 11,314), or an increase of 5 per cent.\n\nThe Lower Dh\u00e1ia of Jagraon resembles that of the other two tahsils. It consists in the first place of villages along the high bank, with some good Bet land, irrigated and unirrigated. Some of the villages in the western part run right down to the river and have Bet land, both inundated and beyond the reach of the floods, besides Dh\u00e1ia land. The Circle is about 14 miles from east to west, and 8 from north to south. It contains 57 villages with a total area of 71,966 acres, or 12 square miles, of which 89 per cent. is cultivation. The village sites are generally just on the ridge, and the soil for two or three miles south of them is very light and poor. The surface is uneven in places, and the sand is shifted about by the strong winds from the south-east. The crops and husbandry are much the same as those described for the corresponding Circles of the other tahsils.\nThe ownership is thus divided amongst the various agricultural tribes: Hindu Jats, 70 per cent.; Muhammadan Rajputs, 5 per cent.; Muhammadan Gajars, 4 per cent.; Muhammadan Arifens, 11 per cent.; others, 10 per cent. The Muhammadans hold the villages along the high bank and nearly all the Bet land; the Jats, those further south. The cultivation is in the following proportion: by proprietors, 79 per cent.; cultivated with rights of occupancy, 8 per cent.; cultivated by proprietors of occupancy tenants of other land, 8 per cent.; by tenants with no proprietary or occupancy rights, 5 per cent. The Circle has not many natural advantages, for the soil is mostly poor and incapable of yielding very much; but some of the Jat villages adjoining the Upper Dharia are more favourably situated, and have good irrigated and unirrigated, as well as poor lands. These are the best villages in the Circle; and in them the people are very well-to-do. In a few the proprietors are able to go in for a little trade; and the village sites present an appearance of prosperity, carts, good cattle, and some elaboration of the dwellings being the principal signs. Some few Jat families have taken to money-lending. The villages adjoining the high bank are not at all well-off, both Jat or Muhammadan, and complaints are very generally made. On the whole the Circle is not in such good condition as would have justified much enhancement of the former assessment, but, on the other hand, there is nothing to show over assessment, for the demand was admittedly light. It is only of the poverty of the soil that the people complain. Of the total area of the Circle the Appendices to the Settlement Report show one per cent. as sold since Regular Settlement, and ten per cent. as now held in mortgage. In both cases only about one-third of the land has gone into the hands of money-lenders; and most of the sales have been to members of the village community. The price realized is Rs. 40 an acre, or Rs. 39 per rupee of Government demand; and the amount secured per acre on mortgage with possession, Rs. 29, or Rs. 28 per rupee of the demand. These prices are higher than one would have expected from the nature of the soil.\n\nThe revenue rates sanctioned were as follows:\n\n| Soil     | Area | Rate | Resulting jama | Half asset estimate |\n|----------|------|------|----------------|---------------------|\n| Bat.     |      |      |                |                     |\n| Chahi    | 1,007| 3-12-0| 4,114          | 6,673               |\n| Dofali   | 2,125| 1-10-0| 3,453          | 3,579               |\n| Ekfauli  | 2,157| 1-4-0 | 2,606          | 2,258               |\n| Dharia   |      |      |                |                     |\n| Niafi chahi | 2,814| 3-8-0 | 9,849          | 11,260              |\n| Khali chahi | 347 | 2-8-0 | 868            | 935                 |\n| Rauli    | 10,189| 1-2-0| 11,463         | 10,067              |\n| Bhur     | 44,935| 0-12-0| 33,702        | 32,157              |\n| Total    | 63,665|      | 66,145         | 66,299              |\nThe village assessments actually announced amounted to Rs. 67,012, or an increase of 7 per cent. on the previous demand, the jama by rates being Rs. 65,146. In the orders sanctioning the rates it had been indicated that, if possible, an enhancement somewhat over rates should be taken.\n\nThe Upper Dhaia Circle of Jagraon comprises the remaining villages of the tahsil, 100 in number, with an area of 175,945 acres, or 275 square miles. The Circle varies in width (east to west) from 15 to 20 miles, and is about 18 miles from north to south. The Sirhind canal runs across the whole width. Of the total area 156,424 acres, or 89 per cent., are cultivated, and 11,364 (six per cent.), culturable or fallow, the remaining five per cent. being barren waste or Government property. The soil varies a good deal, being in places a stiff loam which requires a good deal of moisture. Sand drifts occur throughout the Circle, and in their neighbourhood the land is somewhat inferior; but the prevailing soil is a good light loam (raufl\u00e9) easily worked and very fertile. There are few villages that have not half of their land of this sort; and, even when the rainfall is short, sowing is possible in some of the land. The percentages of good and bad soils are: raufl\u00e9 and dakh\u00e1r, 83 per cent.; bh\u00fbr, 17. Of the cultivated area eight per cent. is irrigated from wells. This land lies mostly in the eastern and northern villages, which are generally smaller and more populous. In the southwestern villages the holdings are much larger, and irrigation is not required, while the water, too, is at a greater depth, being upwards of 50 feet from the surface at Hatur, and only about 35 in villages adjoining the Lower Dhaia.\n\nThe land is thus held by the various tribes in ownership: Hindu Jats, 72 per cent.; other Hindus, 6 per cent.; Muhammadan Rajputs, 8 per cent.; Muhammadan Gujars, 6 per cent.; Muhammadan Arains, 4 per cent.; others, 4 per cent. The principal gots of Hindu Jats are the Sidhus, Dhaliwalas and Gils. The \"other Hindus\" are Khatris, &c., one or two families of the shop-keeping class having acquired proprietary rights here and there before the Regular Settlement. There are also some Hindu kamins (Chamaras, &c.) who have proprietary rights in a few villages. The Rajputs hold several large villages, or parts of villages (Halwara, Talwandi, &c.). The Gujars and Arains hold land about Jagraon, one or two of the Agowars or subdivisions of the land attached to the town belonging to them. There are also two or three small Harani villages, and the family of Maulavi Rajab Ali own a good deal of land. Of the whole cultivation 78 per cent. is by proprietors, and 22 per cent. by tenants, made up thus:\u2014cultivated with rights of occupancy, 5; cultivated without such rights, but by tenants who are proprietors or occupancy tenants, 11; by tenants without rights in any land, 6. The Hindu Jats of the Circle are as a class very well off. Their villages are all fine large ones, in the hands of strong communities; but the members of these are not all equally well-to-do. Most have thriven, but a few will be found to be in difficulties, and there is a good deal of extravagance due to the influx of wealth which often results in dept. The Jat proprietors have fully participated in the\nprofits due to the great rise in price of the inferior grains; and they have developed more expensive tastes, dressing well, keeping lots of brass dishes, and their women having a great deal of jewelry. The cattle, too, are of a superior class; and most villages have a good many carts and camels that are worked for hire or take the owners' grain to Ludhiana. Large sums are spent on marriage and funeral celebrations, and old men say these expenses have increased threefold; while litigation is a luxury that most of the people indulge in, and will often be found to be the cause of debt. The famines of Sambat 1917 (A.D. 1862) and Sambat 1925 (A.D. 1868) have left their traces in debt, which in many cases has never been shaken off; but the Jat population may safely be said to have thriven under our rule, and to be now in a state of considerable prosperity. Where one of them has got into difficulties and has to mortgage his land, a fellow Jat will always be found able and ready to advance the money; and they could get on very well without the assistance of the money-lending classes, and do so in a great measure. Few of them are unable to dispose of their grain at the market price; and they are generally able to take it direct to Ludhiana and sell it there. Most of them retain a stock of grain which would be sufficient for two or three years' consumption, and they can tide over indifferent harvests without much loss. During the last ten years a great deal of hard cash has found its way into their hands, and few of them would now have to borrow for the payment of revenue in the worst of years. The Muhammadan villages are not so well off. Except the Raekot family, which holds a large area, the Rajputs are all in difficulties, and that although special allowance was made for them in the Regular Settlement. The Arains and Gujars, too, are badly off. The returns show three per cent. of the whole area as sold since Regular Settlement, and twelve per cent. now held in mortgage, most of it with possession. Of the sales three-fourths are to members of the agricultural community and two-thirds of the mortgages with possession are to them. Of the area sold nearly one-third is that of one village bought at the time of Regular Settlement by the Raekot family. The average price is smaller than in the Lower Dh\u00e1ia, as the inclusion of the village mentioned above has lowered it. The average mortgage money per acre is Rs. 35, or 33 times the Government demand.\n\nThe revenue rates sanctioned for this Circle with the results are as follows:\n\n| Soil          | Area   | Rate | Resulting assessment | Half asset estimate |\n|---------------|--------|------|----------------------|---------------------|\n| Ni\u00e1\u00ed ch\u00e1hf    | 8,948  | 3 12 | 53,555               | 37,373              |\n| Kh\u00e1lis ch\u00e1hf  | 3,073  | 2 8  | 7,682                | 8,456               |\n| R\u00e1uall and D\u00e1khar | 1,19,493 | 1 3  | 1,41,000             | 1,52,784            |\n| Bh\u00e9r          | 24,908 | 0 12 | 13,681               | 20,917              |\n| **Total**     |        |      | **2,01,818**         | **2,19,430**         |\nThe village assessments announced and reported amounted to Rs. 2,01,415, being increase of 20 per cent. on the previous demand.\n\nIn the calculations of assessment all agricultural land has been included, whether liable to assessment or not, as it is a cause of great confusion to treat land as a separate class merely because it has been exempted from the payment of revenue. The revenue rates are thus applied to all cultivation; but from the results a deduction must be made on account of mafi, or revenue-free land. The following statement gives a comparison between the jama of the last year of the old and of the first year of the new Settlement after this deduction:\n\n| Tahsil | Revenue (Khalsa and Jagir) |\n|--------|---------------------------|\n|        | Former | New | Increase with percentage | Rate of new assessment on cultivation |\n| Samrala | 2,61,871 | 3,08,386 | 46,715 | 18 |\n| Ludhiana | 4,30,291 | 5,11,852 | 81,571 | 19 |\n| Jagraon | 2,33,525 | 2,71,477 | 37,952 | 16 |\n| Total   | 9,25,677 | 10,91,915 | 1,66,238 | 18 |\n\nThe appointment of zaildars to be paid by a deduction of one per cent. from the revenue was sanctioned over the greater part of the district, and minor deductions were also made from the full assessment on account of land under gardens and for crops injured by trees growing along the main roads. Besides this, where the period of 20 years during which land irrigated from new wells are protected from enhancement had not expired, a deduction from the full assessment for the remainder of that period was made. The jagirdars, too, take a large share of the increase, and the following statement shows the actual immediate increase to the Government revenue:\n\n| Tahsil | Khalsa and Commutation paid by Jagirdars |\n|--------|------------------------------------------|\n|        | Former | New | Actual increase |\n| Samrala | 2,15,564 | 248,943 | 33,379 |\n| Ludhiana | 3,52,556 | 4,05,789 | 53,233 |\n| Jagraon | 2,27,991 | 2,59,596 | 31,575 |\n| Total   | 7,96,111 | 9,14,298 | 1,18,187 |\n\nThus the net actual gain to Government was Rs. 1,18,187; and this will be increased by about Rs. 6,000 when the well leases have all expired. The gain to the jagirdars was Rs. 25,391 immediate, and Rs. 25,974 after the expiry of the well leases, that is, the net gain to them after deduction of the commutation payable to Government, and included in the above statement.\nThe statement in the margin shows the cesses paid at the Regular Settlement and now at the rates per cent. on the revenue. The cesses have been left as they were found in 1880, except for the addition of the District post cesses, which had before been omitted.\n\nTable No. XXX shows the number of villages, parts of villages, and plots, and the area of land of which the revenue is assigned, the amount of that revenue, the period of assignment, and the number of assignees for each tahsil as the figures stood in 1881-82. The principal assignments are noticed in greater detail below, the figures being those of the Revised Settlement.\n\nSome account has already been given in Section F of Chapter III of the principal J\u00e1g\u00edrd\u00e1rs of the district. The Malaundh family, which alone enjoys half of the whole j\u00e1gir income of the district, had established itself under the Empire. The others are mostly the descendants of the petty Chiefs or Confederacies who, on the downfall of the Delhi Empire at the close of the last century, partitioned the country between them, and came under our protection in A.D. 1809 in the manner described in Chapter II. These Chiefs and Confederacies were at that time virtually independent, though it is probable that, but for our interference, they would all have been eventually absorbed by their more powerful neighbours. A few of the J\u00e1gir families, again, have been from the first dependent, having originally had an assignment of a few villages made them by some one of the more important Chiefs (e.g., Kapurthala, N\u00e1bha), and being transferred to us in the annexation of 1846. From 1809 till the outbreak of the first Sikh war in 1845 we had little to do with the internal administration of the estates of the j\u00e1g\u00edrd\u00e1rs, who were allowed to govern much in their own way; but at the close of the Sutlej Campaign in 1846 a great change was effected in the status of all but the seven important Cis-Sutlej Chiefs, who were maintained in the full enjoyment of that virtual independence which is allowed to protected States (See Griffin's \"R\u00e1jas,\" where the proclamation of the Government of India on this subject is given in extenso). All villages not belonging to the seven excepted Chiefs were incorporated in our territory along with what we had acquired by conquest and confiscation from Lahore, N\u00e1bha, &c.; but even after this we exercised but little authority within the estates of the j\u00e1g\u00edrd\u00e1rs, for we only abolished the transit duties and deprived them of their police jurisdiction in the first instance. When, however, the second Sikh war was followed by the annexation of the whole of the Punjab, their power was still further curtailed; and finally, about 1850, it was decided to substitute for their hitherto undefined exactions from the people a fixed cash revenue demand. This last measure, when carried out, reduced all j\u00e1g\u00edrd\u00e1rs alike to the position of mere assignees of Government revenue; and it was a great blow to most of them. They had consi-\ndered themselves as lords of the soil; and it does not appear that their rights over the land were at all inferior to those of the zamin-dars of Bengal. The jagirdars had realized from the cultivators a full proprietor's share of the produce, and there was really no limit to their exactions, except the fear of driving away their villagers. To most of the families who had before been independent the jagirs were continued in perpetuity, unless, of course, they had compromised themselves in the Sikh war and were punished for this by confiscation. The tenures of the others were considered on annexation, and more or less favourable terms were given, some being maintained in whole or in part for the lives of the holders only; and when this course was pursued, subsequent lapses have reduced the villages to the condition of shared. In other cases the original grants were only of a portion of a village.\n\nThe Chiefs and Confederacies had always been liable to pay tribute or furnish levies, or both, to the paramount power; and the contribution had taken the latter form on their coming under our protection. When the final change to a fixed cash assessment was introduced after 1849 it was natural that the irregular demands for which the jagirdars were liable should be replaced by a certain tribute. This in most cases took the form of a contribution at the rate of so much (one to four annas) per rupee of revenue; but for some of the Confederacies it was the estimated cost of maintaining a certain number of horsemen or footmen. In Lodhran and most of the small jagirs the rate of commutation is two or four annas per rupee of revenue; while in Malaudh it is two annas, except in the branch of Sardar Mit Singh, in whose favor a reduction was made to one anna on account of services performed in the Mutiny. As an example of the second form of payment, and as the solitary instance in the district of the istamrari tenure, the case of the village of Lalton may be mentioned. This is held by the descendants of a Garewal Jat, called Chauhdri Gahnda, subject to a fixed payment of Rs. 1,100 per annum, and the cost of maintaining four horsemen at Rs. 16 each per mensem, i.e., Rs. 768 per annum. For the collection of the commutation money in some of the minor jagirs, where the shares are much subdivided, the head of the family has been appointed Sarkarda, or headman, and receives a percentage deduction from the amount which he pays into the Government treasury for the whole jagir.\n\nThe jagirdars besides enjoying the revenues of their villages will be found in many cases to hold in absolute ownership a considerable area of land. This is usually the Bir, or waste land reserved by the ancestors of the family for their own use, as a grazing ground and for the supply of firewood, &c. These Birs have, with the exception of one or two in the Malaudh parganah, been brought under the plough long ago, and are cultivated by the tenants of the jagirdars. The land of absconding cultivators was also considered as belonging to the Chief, and the Malaudh Sardars acquired a considerable amount of landed property in this way just after the introduction of the cash demand of the Regular Settlement.\n\nThe following abstract statement gives all the necessary details as to each of the existing jagirs of the district:\u2014\n### Chapter V, B.\n\n#### Land and Land Revenue.\n\n**Statement of jagirs.**\n\n| Number | Name of Jagir | Name of Jagirdar | Number of Villages | Jagir or shared | Revenue of Jagirdar | Commutation Money |\n|--------|---------------|------------------|--------------------|-----------------|---------------------|-------------------|\n| 1      | Lodhran       | Sardar Shamsher Singh and others | 25 | Jagir | 24,104 | Two annas 3,014 per rupee |\n| 2      | Jaba Marra    | Sardar Ganda Singh and others | 8 | Do | 10,722 | Ditto 1,340 |\n| 3      | Bhari or Kotla Badla | Sardar Lal Singh & others | 4 | Do | 7,611 | Ditto 951 |\n| 4      | Pontiwalla    | Bhir Singh and others | 3 | Do | 6,231 | Ditto 654 |\n| 5      | Dhin Malana   | Sardar Kirpal Singh | 1 | Do | 2,300 | Ditto 278 |\n| 6      | Khosa         | Ushen Singh | 1 | Do | 544 | Ditto 63 |\n| 7      | Shamspur      | Mit Singh and others | 2 | Do | 2,697 | Four annas per rupee 647 |\n| 8      | Kotha Ajmer   | Joila Singh and others | 4 | shared | 2,099 | None |\n| 9      | Nishanawala   | Bishan Singh and others | 4 | Do | 2,149 | 361 |\n| 10     | Saloudi (fraternity) | Dasoudha Singh and others | 4 | Do | 1,703 | None |\n| 11     | Raghian       | Khai Narain Singh | 1 | Jagir | 1,109 | Ditto |\n| 12     | Jalwala       | Mt.

The Jagraon tahsil was held entirely by the Rais in the first place, and after them by the Kapurthala Chief, from whom we annexed it; and the jagirs in it are really charitable grants of whole villages or shares, there being nothing to correspond with those held by the families and confederacies of the other tahsils.\n\nRegarding minor assignments of revenue the Settlement Officer writes as follows. \"The grants of the district were of the usual three classes\u2014(1) in perpetuity, (2) for the maintenance of institutions, (3) during the life or lives of the grantees; but the greater part of them were of a fourth class,(4) sanctioned for the term of the Regular Settlement. With respect to (1), (2) and (3) our enquiries brought to light no discrepancies of any importance. The grants for the term of Settlement (4) were either personal, in favour of Brahmans or others of the priestly class; or they were for the support of some religious or charitable institution. Most of them were petty and unimportant, and it had clearly never been the intention that they should be enjoyed in perpetuity. The principles on which we have now dealt with them are as follows. Where the object of the grant was the support of some institution, and this was found to be maiu-\ntained, continuance was recommended and sanctioned. Where the grant was a personal one, and the original grantee or his children were in possession, the same course was followed; but where the grant was personal, and was held by a number of sharers, the descendants in the third or fourth generation from the original grantee, we generally recommended resumption, or rather that the grant should be allowed to lapse.

Under this rule the following places were returned as the towns of the district:\n\n| Tahsil | Town   | Persons | Males | Females |\n|--------|--------|---------|-------|---------|\n| Ludhiana | Ludhiana | 44,163  | 24,685 | 19,478 |\n| Jagran | Jagraon | 16,873  | 8,816  | 8,057   |\n|        | Halkot | 9,210   | 4,783  | 4,428   |\n| Sampla | Machhvara | 6,967   | 3,271  | 2,696   |\n|        | Khanna | 3,988   | 2,214  | 1,774   |\n|        | Bahlolpur | 2,842   | 1,570  | 1,272   |\n| Total  |         | 83,052  | 45,769 | 37,284  |\n\nThe distribution by religion of the population of these towns and the number of houses in each are shown in Table No. XLIII, while further particulars will be found in the Census Report in Table XIX and its appendix and Table XX. The remainder of this chapter consists of a detailed description of each town, with a brief notice of its history, the increase and decrease of its population, its commerce, manufactures, municipal government, institutions, and public buildings; and statistics of births and deaths, trade and manufactures, wherever figures are available.\n\nLudhiana is the principal town and the head-quarters of the district. It is situated on the ridge just over the Budha nala, or former bed of the Sutlej, and about six miles from the present course; and lies on the Sindh, Punjab and Delhi Railway, and the Grand Trunk Road (Delhi to Lahore), the distance from Lahore being by these 116 miles. It is also connected with Ferozepore by a metalled road of 72 miles length.\n\nThe town was founded in the time of the Lodi Emperors, on the site of a village called Mirhota, the date recorded being 898 Hijri (A.D. 1481). The founders were Yusaf Khan and Nihang Khan Lodis, or perhaps the latter alone; and there is no reason to doubt the generally accepted origin of the name Ludhiana, although this has been corrupted into the present form Ludhiana. The situation selected was a slight eminence on the south bank of the Sutlej, commanding the passage of the river, on the high road from Central Asia to India. The history of the town is in a great measure that of the district, and will be found in Chapter II. Under the Lodis it was the seat of Government for this part of the Empire, and a large fort was built on the site of the present one by Jalal Khan, grandson of Nihang Khan. The Mughals fixed the headquarters of the Sarkar, or division of the Province (Subah), at Sirhind, and Ludhiana was only a mahal* or district; but it did not lose its importance; and, to judge from what are said to have been the boundaries of the Lodis' city, it must have had a population of 5,000\n\n*Mahal corresponded to our tahsil better than to any other subdivision.\nor 6,000. Neither did it suffer from the Dur\u00e1ni invasions, although, as already noticed, N\u00e1dir Sh\u00e1h is said to have ordered a general massacre of the people. On the downfall of the Mughal Empire it passed quietly into the hands of the Rais about the year 1760; and under them enjoyed the same measure of prosperity as before. Rai Kalha improved the fort, and it was one of the th\u00e1nahs under the rule of this family. M\u00e1har\u00e1ja Ranjit Singh took it with the rest of the country from R\u00e1ni Bh\u00e1g Bhari in 1806, and gave it to his uncle, R\u00e1jah Bh\u00e1g Singh of Jind. When Sir D. Ochterlony advanced to the Sutlej in 1809 land was allotted to us for a cantonment to the west of the town; but we held nothing else till 1835,* when, on the death of R\u00e1jah Sangat Singh, the town and country about became our own possessions (See Chapter II for details of the above sketch).\n\nWhen the town was transferred to us it appears to have occupied the space between the fort and ridge over the lowlands (which latter was the boundary on two sides), and the present Chaura Baz\u00e1r up to the Sabzmandi, and on from that the Hazuri Sarak. The present Municipal Hall and the Tomb of Pir Roshan\u2020 are situated outside the old limits on the west; but to the east of this the houses covered the whole of the unoccupied space between the fort and the present town. Mr. Walker has been unable to find any record of the estimated population of that time. The old Imperial Road entered the town on the eastern side, where now the houses of the American Mission settlement stand; and the Residency was also on this side; while the cantonments lay to the west, the present civil station being the remnants of them. Under Sir Claude Wade (1823-38) and his successors the town increased in size and importance, spreading out to the southwards. It became the centre of a very extensive trade in grain, sugar, cloth, &c., which found its way down the Sutlej in boats from Phillour. There had always been a small colony of eight or ten families of Kashmir\u00ed weavers in the city; but in the year 1833 A.D. a famine in Kashmir drove numbers of this class all over the country, and some 1,500 to 2,000 of them were settled in the town, and started in trade by the exertions of Sir C. Wade. In 1842, on our withdrawal from Cabul, the family of the Amir Shuja-ul-Mulk, with a numerous body of adherents and attendants came with us; and Ludhi\u00e1na, then a frontier station, was fixed on as their residence. They at first took up their abode on the west side of the city; but soon after shifted to the south side, where the land on which their houses and gardens now stand was assigned to them. When after the Sutlej campaign the Ludhi\u00e1na district was formed, the civil offices were removed to the cantonment side of the city; and in 1854-55 the Grand Trunk Road was metalled and realigned to its present position. In 1854 the cantonments were abandoned, a small force being retained as a garrison of the fort; but this change does not appear to have much affected the town, which, with the improved communications, was becoming more\n\n* Although the town was not nominally ours till 1835, the Political Agents appear to have exercised paramount influence in it from the first, and many of the improvements effected in it date from before 1835.\n\n\u2020 \"Pir Abdul Qadir Jal\u00e1mi\" (see para. 64).\nimportant every year as a centre of trade. The events of the mutiny are related in Chapter II. The houses of the city at that time came to within a short distance of the fort; and, when the garrison mutinied, it was found to be in communication with the town people just outside of it\u2014Sufis, Suds, G\u00fajars, &c. Mr. Ricketts, on the departure of the mutineers, ordered the demolition of all the houses within a radius of 200 or 300 yards of the fort, the inhabitants settling down where they could. The G\u00fajars were removed to their lands below the city; the Sufis took up their abode in the vicinity of the Cantonment B\u00e1z\u00e1r, where they now live; and the Suds and others spread themselves over the city. The opening of the Railway from Delhi to Lahore in 1870 gave a great stimulus to the trade of Ludhi\u00e1na; and a number of shops and sar\u00e1\u00eds were built along the Grand Trunk Road, facing the station.\n\nThe town is situated in an angle of the ridge or high bank, which to the east of it runs due north and south and then turns westward, forming the boundary on two sides. The houses are mostly built of masonry. In the old part, of which the limits have been indicated in the last paragraph, they rise storey over storey, and are crowded together; while the streets and lanes are narrow and tortuous. But the new town to the south of the Chaura B\u00e1z\u00e1r bears all the marks of being modern. The streets are wide and straight, and the houses and shops mostly of one pattern. The principal streets, the Chaura B\u00e1z\u00e1r and the Haznri Sarak, were designed by Sir C. Wade himself; and one of his projects, the Iqbal Ganj, is a standing proof that he was rather too sanguine about the speedy development of the town for which he did so much. His successors, Assistant Agents and Deputy Commissioners, have each added something\u2014e.g., the Murray Ganj (Captain Murray), Ghalla Mandi, or grain market (Captain Larkins), and the Kaiser Ganj, the last within the last two or three years. In the old parts of the town, such as the Naugarah square, the houses are many storeys high, but in the new town they are generally of only one as yet, though some of the people along the Chaura B\u00e1z\u00e1r have added a second. The old town was divided into mahallas according to tribes (Suds, Sufis, Saiads, &c.); but these have mostly been lost sight of. Attached to the city is a large area owned principally by Saiads, G\u00fajars and Ar\u00e1iens, most of whom reside within the town limits or in the old military b\u00e1z\u00e1r, and this land is divided into eight Tarafs.\n\nThe population as ascertained at the enumerations of 1868, 1875 and 1881 is shown below:\n\n| Limits of enumeration | Year of census | Persons | Males | Females |\n|-----------------------|---------------|---------|-------|---------|\n| Whole town            |               |         |       |         |\n|                       | 1868          | 39,963  | 21,704| 18,252  |\n|                       | 1875          | 44,163  | 24,655| 19,478  |\n| Municipal limits      |               |         |       |         |\n|                       | 1868          | 39,963  | 21,704| 18,252  |\n|                       | 1875          | 40,285  | 24,655| 15,630  |\n|                       | 1881          | 44,163  | 24,655| 19,478  |\nThe figures for the population within municipal limits according to the Census of 1868 are taken from the published tables of the Census of 1875; but it was noted at the time that their accuracy was in many cases doubtful. It would appear from information supplied by the Deputy Commissioner that some suburbs have been included since 1868 within the municipal boundary, and in particular one called the Chhauni, with a population of 1,248 souls. This leaves an increase of 2,530 within thirteen years so far as the figures go. But the Deputy Commissioner is strongly of opinion that the real increase is much larger, and that the figures of 1868 were in excess of the truth. He attributes the large increase, which he describes as obvious and palpable, to the opening of the railway, and the consequent erection of Ludhi\u00e1na into a collecting centre for the grain traffic.\n\nThe constitution of the population by religion and the number of occupied houses are shown in Table No. XLIII. Details of sex will be found in Table XX of the Census Report of 1881. The annual birth and death rates per mille of population since 1868 are given below, the basis of calculation being in every case the figures of the most recent Census:\n\n| Year | Birth Rates | Death Rates |\n|------|-------------|-------------|\n|      | Persons     | Males       | Females | Persons | Males | Females |\n| 1868 | ...         | ...         | ...     | 16      | 16    | 13     |\n| 1869 | ...         | ...         | ...     | 32      | 33    | 30     |\n| 1870 | ...         | ...         | ...     | 7       | 35    | 34     |\n| 1871 | ...         | ...         | ...     | 17      | 21    | 22     |\n| 1872 | ...         | ...         | ...     | 18      | 24    | 30     |\n| 1873 | ...         | ...         | ...     | 26      | 14    | 19     |\n| 1874 | ...         | ...         | ...     | 41      | 25    | 30     |\n| 1875 | ...         | ...         | ...     | 42      | 23    | 30     |\n| 1876 | ...         | ...         | ...     | 45      | 23    | 22     |\n| 1877 | ...         | ...         | ...     | 43      | 21    | 21     |\n| 1878 | ...         | ...         | ...     | 42      | 22    | 20     |\n| 1879 | ...         | ...         | ...     | 22      | 11    | 11     |\n| 1880 | ...         | ...         | ...     | 43      | 23    | 21     |\n| 1881 | ...         | ...         | ...     | 45      | 23    | 21     |\n| Average | 33 | 19 | 15 | 41 | 38 | 43 |\n\nThe actual number of births and deaths registered during the last five years is shown in Table No. XLIV.\n\nFrom the situation of the town over the lowlands and the swamps along the Budha n\u00e1la one would expect malarious fever to prevail in the months following the rains. In some years, such as 1878, there has been a tremendous loss of life from this cause, the half-starved Kashmiris and others of the lower classes not having sufficient stamina to resist the attacks of the disease. Between six and seven per cent. of the whole population died from fever alone in that year (1878); and the death-rate, which had averaged 33 in the preceding five years, rose to 111. But at other times the town cannot be said to be unhealthy, and there has been no epidemic of cholera since 1872. The sanitary arrangements are good for an Indian town, and the system of drainage appears to be now efficient. Inspection reports since 1878 speak well of Ludhi\u00e1na, which was before considered to be very backward in this respect, the improvement being ascribed to the exertions of Mr. Wakefield,\nthe present Deputy Commissioner. The supply of drinking water is from wells inside the town, the quality being apparently very bad on analysis; but it is said that it has evil effects only on new comers. The average death-rate does not compare unfavourably with that of most Punjab towns.\n\nReference has already been made to the ever-increasing grain trade of which Ludhi\u00e1na is the entrep\u00f4t; but this appears to be mostly in the hands of merchants from down country; and the town cannot perhaps be said to have much connection with it. The returns of municipal taxation for last year give the following values of the various articles of trade which were taxed:\n\n| Article                  | Value   |\n|--------------------------|---------|\n| Grain                    | Rs. 25,79,568 |\n| Sugar products           | Rs. 2,81,259  |\n| Cloth                    | Rs. 6,50,086  |\n| Iron                     | Rs. 24,304    |\n| Brass and metal dishes   | Rs. 20,378    |\n| Others                   | Rs. 4,21,590   |\n| **Total**                | **Rs. 37,83,185** |\n\nGrain in transit is, at all events nominally, untaxed, that is, if it does not change hands within octroi limits, which embrace the railway station and encamping ground. Wool, cotton and salt are also exempted. In the last of these there is a considerable trade. The following estimate is given of the value of the imports in these three articles:\n\n| Article | Value |\n|---------|-------|\n| Salt    | Rs. 30,000 |\n| Pashm   | Rs. 50,000 |\n| Cotton  | Rs. 30,000 |\n\nIt is for its weaving industry, however, that Ludhi\u00e1na is principally famous; and this is of two sorts\u2014woollen and cotton.* The former of these, the manufacture of the cloths known as pashmina and R\u00e1mpur chadars from Thibetan and R\u00e1mpur wool, is at present entirely in the hands of the Kashmiri colony, although some of the country weavers are said to be picking it up. The raw material is of two classes\u2014pashm, or the fine wool of the Thibetan goat; and R\u00e1mpuri un, or that of the nearer hills. The former is said to come from the Barj\u00e1ni country, which is rather indefinite geographically. Both wools are brought finally from R\u00e1mpur, which appears to be the entrep\u00f4t of the trade, by the gaddis or hill men. These men used to take the direct route via Rupar; but now generally reach Ludhi\u00e1na from Umballa by rail. Within recent years (20 or 30) a third class of wool has begun to be imported from Kirm\u00e1n, in Persia, via Kar\u00e1chi and Lahore; and this is used as a substitute for R\u00e1mpur wool. The wool from the hills is brought here in the months of October and November, and the annual amount of the sales is estimated at Rs. 50,000. The purchases are made, in the first instance, by Hindu merchants, who take large amounts of it, and retail them to a second class of traders, or to the Kashmir\u00eds. The wool is spun into thread by women of all classes, Hindu and Muhammadan, rich and\n\n* See also Mr. Kipling's note on the manufactures of the District in Section C of Chapter IV.\npoor; and any woman can earn from rupees three to four a month by this. The Kashmiri gets a few rupees worth of wool or thread from the merchant (mahajan) and weaves it into a chadar or piece six to eight yards long and 1\u00bd to 1\u00bd yards wide (Kashmiri measure). The cloth is of two descriptions\u2014pashmina and nagli pashmina, the former entirely of pashm, and the latter a woof (banda) of pashm on a warp (tana) of Rampur wool and sometimes of Kirmani. It is designated generally as ahudin, and is white in colour when it comes off the loom, but may be dyed red, green, &c., according to taste. The chadars are purchased by well-to-do natives for wearing over the shoulders like an ordinary cloak, the piece being cut into two lengths of about three yards each, which are joined at the corners and worn double. The shawl industry (sad bafi), or the weaving from pashm thread of Kashmir shawls was perhaps the most important branch of all; but it has never recovered from the complete stoppage of the trade in these articles on account of the Franco-Prussian war (1870). It is said that there were upwards of 1,000 Kashmiris engaged in it before that time, and an out-turn of more than Rs. 1,00,000 worth of shawls; but France was the principal customer, and has ceased to take any since 1870; and there are now not more than 100 looms (single), the rest of the weavers having turned their hands to what they could, many being reduced to beggary. There appears now to be no demand anywhere for good shawls. Native States used to take them for dresses of honor, &c.; but do not now to anything like the same extent. The only shawl work at present done is in coarse wool, what we know as jamewar. These are worn by natives as cloaks and are also exported towards Persia, where they are said to be used for waist cloths, or are cut into strips for borders of chogas, &c. A little fine work is still done in making wide borders for cloaks, the centrepiece being plain ahudin. The coarse work turned out is not worth an hundredth part of what the fine shawl work was, a piece of jamewar selling for a few rupees where a shawl would have sold for Rs. 200 to 300. An ordinary chadar of pashmina costs Rs. 20 to 30, and of nagli pashmina, Rs. 15 to 20. The looms are almost entirely single, and not more than two or three men ever work together, unless where apprentices learn the art from a master-weaver. The district return gives 900 looms with 960 weavers, but Ahsan Shah, who is the representative of the body of Kashmiris, gives an estimate of 400 looms with 1,300 men and boys, weavers and apprentices. The Kashmiri population of the district is returned in the recent Census as 2,492, but a large proportion of these are in service or have other occupations. The pashmina and Rampur chadars of Ludhiana sell all over India; and the value exported is estimated at 1\u00bd lakhs, but the industry is said to have earned a bad reputation in recent years owing to the mixture of the inferior Kirmani wool. The pashmina is mostly bought up from the weavers by large merchants, either Hindus or Kashmiris. On the whole the pashmina industry appears to be on the decline, and Ahsan Shah says that the weavers are leaving the town, as the cloth is becoming a drug in the market. The Kashmiris also knit stockings, gloves, &c. There are a good many looms at which common country blankets are woven by Mahbis.\nChapter VI.\n\nTowns and Municipalities.\n\nCotton weaving.\n\n(Ch\u00fahras or Cham\u00e1rs converted to Sikhism). The miscellaneous looms of all these sorts are returned as 400.\n\nThe other important industry of the town is in the hands of the country weavers (Jul\u00e1has), who make from cotton the cloth known as Ludhi\u00e1na cloth, and locally as gabrun; and also lungis or turbans, khes, chadars, &c. The gabrun is of a checked or striped pattern, and is made in pieces of 15 to 20 yards length, and about a yard width. The lungis are of blue and other colours, and have embroidered ends, with or without gold thread. The gabrun is in great demand for making clothes for Europeans and well-to-do natives, and there is a large export of it in all directions. The lungis go principally in the direction of Lahore, and are much used by the Frontier people as turbans. There is also some manufacture of table linen, the cloth known as susi, and many others. The number of looms weaving cotton stuffs is returned in the district statement as 400, but a reliable estimate given to me fixes it at 900. The looms, as in the case of pashm\u00edna, are mostly single; but the estimate referred to sets down the number of weavers and apprentices at 1,700. The same loom may turn out in succession all sorts of cloth, according to the demand\u2014gabrun, lungi, khes, &c. The cotton industries are flourishing, and there is an increasing demand for all sorts of cloths woven at Ludhi\u00e1na.\n\nEmbroidery.\n\nEmbroidery on pashm\u00edna is done by the same Kashmir\u00eds who weave the cloth, and by their children. The latter are generally put on this when first their instruction begins. The thread used is silk, and all sorts of designs are worked on the margins of the chadars, chogas, rum\u00e1ls (scarves), smoking-caps, &c. Embroidery work is also done on the lungis, and on caps with gold thread by Kashmir\u00eds, and by country weavers; and there are eight or ten shops where silk embroidery is worked on broad cloth for table covers, cushions, slippers, &c.*\n\nCarpentry and miscellaneous.\n\nThe carpenters of Ludhi\u00e1na are famous for good work; and 200 shops are returned in which d\u00e1k gharries, carriages and carts on English models, chairs, tables, &c., are made. The leather and other industries are not of much importance.\n\nMunicipality and octroi.\n\nThe town has a Municipal Committee of the second class, with thirteen members appointed by Government, the Deputy Commissioner being President. The average income for the last seven years from octroi is Rs. 53,400. The increase during the last few years has been enormous:\n\n| Year | Income |\n|------|--------|\n| 1876-77 | Rs. 87,651 |\n| 1877-78 | Rs. 47,025 |\n| 1878-79 | Rs. 48,916 |\n| 1879-80 | Rs. 55,076 |\n| 1880-81 | Rs. 57,353 |\n| 1881-82 | Rs. 56,491 |\n| 1882-83 | Rs. 71,289 |\n\n* The embroidery is usually of two classes, called korch\u00e9bi and dori, and is worked with silk or gold thread on pashm\u00edna, merino, broad cloth, &c. In the first of these the cloth is stretched on a frame horizontally before the worker, and the work is coarser; while in dori embroidery the thread and the work are finer. A third sort of work is called dri, and is done with an awl, being very coarse.\nThus in 1882-83 the taxation was at the rate of nearly Re. 1-12 a head of the population; but the greater part of it is levied on the grain trade, some Rs. 40,000 being derived from this source in 1882-83. The expenditure for the last year has been under the following heads:\n\n| Establishment          | Rs.   |\n|------------------------|-------|\n| Octroi                  |       |\n| Police                  | 9,115 |\n| Education               | 5,865 |\n| Sanitation              | 13,926|\n| Hospital                | 3,051 |\n| Paving streets, making  | 10,716|\n| drains, &c.             |       |\n| Miscellaneous           | 5,491 |\n\nTotal Rs. 53,575\n\nThe principal educational institutions are the Government High School, with an attendance of 189 boys; the Primary Government School, 211; the Mission School, 527; a Hindu Aided School, 123. There are only two regular printing presses, one belonging to the American Mission Society, which publishes a weekly journal called Nur Afsh\u00e1n, and the Dharm Sah\u00e1ik press maintained in connection with the Hindu School above mentioned. The principal public buildings and offices are the Municipal Hall, the Post Office, D\u00e1k Bungalow, Kotw\u00e1li or Police Station, Tahsil and Telegraph offices, which all lie near the entrance of the Chaura B\u00e1z\u00e1r, just outside the town to the west; and the Railway station. Across the Railway line, which separates it from the city, at a distance of about quarter of a mile, is the district office or Kach\u00e9ri, while beyond this lie the church, the cemetery, and the few houses of the European district staff.\n\nTo the north of the city the fort is situated on a point of the ridge overlooking the lowlands. It is a square structure with a high mud wall and a deep ditch, the inside measuring about 100 yards each way; and it owes its present form to Sir D. Ochterlony, who made use of the bricks found in the neighbouring ruins of Sunet for building it. The principal streets of the town are the Chaura B\u00e1z\u00e1r, which runs east and west the whole length of the town, the Baz\u00e1ran, Pans\u00e1ri, Lucha and Lakar B\u00e1z\u00e1rs, Wade Ganj, Hazuri Sarak; and the squares or market-places are the Ghalla Mandi, Kaiser Ganj, and others belonging to private persons. It is in these last squares and market-places that most of the dealings in the grain trade inside the city go on. There is always a great deal of business in the Chaura B\u00e1z\u00e1r, where cloth, shoes, &c., are hawked about; and of an afternoon it is crowded with people along the whole length. There are two or three s\u00e9ra\u00eds along the Grand Trunk Road, facing the Railway station, in which grain is stored, those of Ali Muhammad of Jhajjar, Kanabia L\u00e1l, &c. Outside the city to the south lie the houses and gardens of Sh\u00e1hz\u00e1da Sh\u00e1hpur, and the other refugees; and beside them are the Jail and Dispensary, while the Mission Settlement is situated further on at the south-east corner.\n\nLudhi\u00e1na is one of the most important of the American Mission Settlement Mission stations in the Punjab. The following brief history of it is furnished by the Reverend E. M. Wherry.* \"Established in 1836\n\n* For further information see Section C, Chapter III.\nby the Reverend J. Newton and a colleague, the Reverend James Wilson; burnt down in 1845 by the Sikhs, and again destroyed by mutineers in 1857. It publishes books and tracts, mostly religious, in Urdu, Hindi, Punjabi, Kashmiri, Sindhi, Thakari and English. Over five millions volumes have been printed since it began, and now the number averages about 250,000 annually. The Nur Afsh\u00e1n newspaper is published since 1872, circulation 750 weekly.\" The settlement consists of three or four European and a number of native houses just outside the limits of the town, with a church, printing press, &c. There is another church at the west end of the Choura Baz\u00e1r beside the Kotwali, and a school building beside the Kaiser Ganj. In the printing press excellent work, typography and lithography, is done; and there are also workshops attached to the Mission in which wood-work, book-binding and other industries are carried on. Adjoining the Mission compound is the Native Christian Girls' School.\n\nThe principal places of interest have been mentioned in the preceding paragraph. To the west of the Railway and behind the district offices is a Rakh, or plantation, under the Forest Department. This is traversed by roads in all directions lined with ornamental gardening; and it also contains a very good zoological collection. The Rakh is a great place of resort as a drive for the Europeans and rich natives; but all classes of the town and country people frequent it, coming to look at the beasts and birds. On the last Saturday of every month there is a fair held in it, and this is attended by crowds of people. The old cantonment has completely disappeared, except such houses as have been kept for the European residents, and a few offices close to the town, and the church and cemetery. The marks of the compounds are visible in places, but most of the land occupied by the old lines is now under cultivation. There are few antiquities in or around the city. The tomb of Pir Abdul Qadir Jalani has already been referred to. This is in the open space to the south of the fort. There is also an old tomb in the Saiad's mohalla of one of their ancestors, (Saiad Ali Fil Mast) to which is attached a grant of land, and several Hindu temples (Shiv\u00e1l\u00e1s and Thakard\u00e1ras) of recent date. The mound of Sunet lies about three miles west of the town.\n\nThe second town in importance is Jagraon, which lies at a short distance to the south of the road connecting Ludhiana and Ferozepur, 24 miles west of the former. It is the head-quarters of the tahsil of the same name, and has a population of 16,873; but the greater part of this is made up by the suburbs, called Agw\u00e1rs, which are really ordinary villages, each with a large area of land attached to it, and inhabited by the same classes as other villages. The town population proper is only 6,777, leaving 10,096 to the suburbs. In the town proper the houses are nearly all of masonry, and many of those belonging to the mercantile community are very fine buildings, several storeys high. Owing to the flatness of the surrounding country the town can be seen from a great distance on all sides, and has a very imposing appearance. The streets are fairly straight and wide for a native town, and are well paved. The situation is most healthy, being well removed from the river; and the climate, though\nvery hot at times, is dry and salubrious. The death-rate of five years previous to 1878 was 38; but in that year the town suffered like others from fever. The population has increased by six per cent since 1868.\n\nThe population as ascertained at the enumerations of 1868, 1875, and 1881 is shown below:\n\n| Limits of Enumeration | Year of Census | Persons | Males | Females |\n|-----------------------|---------------|---------|-------|---------|\n| Whole town            | 1868          | 15,881  | 8,179 | 7,702   |\n|                       | 1881          | 16,273  | 8,516 | 7,657   |\n| Municipal limits      | 1868          | 15,881  |       |         |\n|                       | 1875          | 16,321  |       |         |\n|                       | 1881          | 16,273  |       |         |\n\nIt is difficult to ascertain the precise limits within which the enumerations of 1868 and 1875 were taken; but the details in the margin, which give the population of the suburbs, throw some light on the matter. The figures for the population within municipal limits according to the Census of 1868 are taken from the published tables of the Census of 1875; but it was noted at the time that their accuracy was in many cases doubtful. It would appear from information supplied by the Deputy Commissioner that some of the smaller Suburbs have been included within municipal limits since 1868.\n\nThe constitution of the population by religion and the number of occupied houses are shown in Table No. XLIII. Details of sex will be found in Table XX of the Census Report of 1881. The annual birth and death-rates per mille of population since 1868 are given below, the basis of calculation being in every case the figures of the most recent Census:\n\n| Year | Birth-Rates | Death-Rates |\n|------|-------------|-------------|\n|      | Persons | Males | Females | Persons | Males | Females |\n| 1868 | ...     | ...    | ...     | 27     | 30    | 24     |\n| 1869 | ...     | ...    | ...     | 40     | 43    | 37     |\n| 1870 | 16     | 18    | 13     | 40     | 43    | 37     |\n| 1871 | 24     | 20    | 19     | 24     | 25    | 24     |\n| 1872 | 21     | 12    | 9      | 55     | 55    | 55     |\n| 1873 | 14     | 18    | 11     | 10     | 10    | 18     |\n| 1874 | 39     | 31    | 15     | 30     | 25    | 35     |\n| 1875 | 39     | 30    | 19     | 40     | 39    | 40     |\n| 1876 | 41     | 23    | 18     | 39     | 36    | 41     |\n| 1877 | 79     | 39    | 39     | 64     |       |       |\n| 1878 | 30     | 22    | 17     | 68     | 67    | 69     |\n| 1879 | 33     | 15    | 15     | 45     | 46    | 44     |\n| 1880 | 51     | 26    | 25     | 33     | 33    | 33     |\n| 1881 | 49     | 25    | 24     | 37     | 36    | 37     |\n| Average | 40 | 23 | 19 | 40 | 38 | 38 |\n\nThe town is of no antiquity, and the account given of its founding is this. The country about was lying waste when, some 200\nyears ago under Rai Kalha, a Muhammadan faqir called Lape Sh\u00e1h, took up his residence on the site of the present town, and prophesied that a city would be built there, the streets of which he marked out as they now run. Rai Kalha called cultivators from all parts\u2014G\u00fajars, Ar\u00e1jens and Jats; and assigned them the lands round the site according to the number of each tribe; and also settled a mercantile community, whose dwellings he enclosed with a wall, the agricultural populations settling down each body in a site in their own land outside this city. These outlying sites were shut in with the usual hedges (w\u00e1r), hence the designation of the suburbs from \u00e1g (forward or outer) and w\u00e1r. The town was called after a Rajp\u00fat named Jigra, who exerted himself in promoting its growth; and who was probably the Rai's representative. A small tomb of Lape Sh\u00e1h stands in the centre of the city, and every Thursday there is a mela or celebration in his honour, in which Hindus and Muhammadans alike take part. About two miles north of Jagraon, on the west of the Sidhwan road, is a mound of some dimensions, called Solah, marking the site of an old village in the place of which the Agw\u00e1s and other neighbouring villages (Sherpur, &c.) are said to have arisen. It was here that in 1802 A.D. the young Rai Ali\u00e1s met with his death in the hunting field. Under the R\u00e1n\u00eds who succeeded him, Ahmed G\u00fajar, the Th\u00e1nadar or local representative of the family, tried to assert his independence; but was expelled with the assistance of Pati\u00e1la. It has been related elsewhere how in 1806-8 M\u00e1har\u00e1j\u00e1 Ranj\u00edt Singh stripped the R\u00e1n\u00eds of their possessions; and the country about Jagraon passed into the hands of the Ahluw\u00e1l\u00eda (Kapurthala) Chief, under whom the town became the head-quarters of the il\u00e1ga or territory, and the mud fort of the Rais was improved. The town came into our possession with the rest of the country in 1846, and the fort was demolished; but there are still remnants of the walls.\n\nThe town has a very considerable trade, being situated at the head of the great grain-producing Jangal tract. There is a large colony of the mercantile class, mostly Khatri of the Beri, Lumbe, Maria, Jaidke gots, who have money-lending dealings with the villagers about; and a great deal of grain finds its way into the b\u00e1z\u00e1r in small amounts when the cultivator has not enough to make a journey to Ludhi\u00e1na worth while. These driblets collect in the granaries of the trading classes, and are kept till they can be disposed of at a profit. It is estimated that there are now some 400,000 maunds (pucka) of grain in the city. The town was once famous for its large granaries; but great losses occurred in consequence of the contents of these rotting, and the grain is now stored in small flat-roofed rooms. The merchants from Ludhi\u00e1na go and buy up on the spot from the local traders, or the latter bring the grain to Ludhi\u00e1na. The opening of a new line of railway to Ferozepur with a good station at Jagraon would be likely to divert much of the grain trade from Ludhi\u00e1na. There is a very large sale of brass and copper dishes, and of cloth in the b\u00e1z\u00e1r; and it may be said that the whole country to the distance of 30 or 40 miles south and west is supplied from here, the Jats coming very great\ndistances to purchase. The chief transactions are in clothes of the better sort, such as are used on marriage and other festive occasions, gold embroidery, &c. The main street (Chaut) is generally thronged with buyers, particularly at the marriage season (May-June); and it is no uncommon thing for a well-to-do Jat to throw down Rs. 200 or 300 in hard cash in payment of a purchase of clothes. There are 15 or 20 shops of Thatidars, or workers in brass, where the usual dishes are made from sheets of the metal; and there is also an import of ready-made goods of this class from Delhi, Jagadhi, &c., for sale at the ordinary shops. The brass dishes made at Jagraon are famous throughout the country, and fetch high prices. There is also a considerable trade in iron. There are a few workers in ivory, who make bangles, small boxes, &c. The bangles of ivory are necessary in every Hindu marriage, hence the industry. There are also considerable dealings in gold, of which a great deal is now-a-days purchased by the Jats for bangles and other jewellery. The Ashrads of Jagraon have a great reputation for selling the metal pure.\n\nJagraon is a Municipality of the third class. The average for the last seven years of the octroi income is 9,190, which is spent on the usual objects\u2014Sanitation, Police, Education, &c. The Tahsil buildings are on the Ferozepur Road, with the encamping ground and Sarai, about a mile from the town, but connected with it by a good metalled road. The Police Station is inside the town in the building where the representative of the Ahluwalia Chief used to reside. There is a Government Middle School, in which English and Vernacular are taught; and two girls' schools, Hindu and Muhammadan, supported from Municipal Funds. The average attendance for last year was 279 boys and 68 girls. There is also a dispensary maintained from the same source. The tomb of Lape Shah, the patron saint of the city, is a small erection, standing in one of the chief streets near the centre of the city. The family of Maulavi Rajab Ali have some fine houses, and also a garden with tombs and a mosque in it adjoining them. The Beris, Lumbas, &c., have also some very fine edifices; and Devi Chand Beri has erected for the accommodation of travellers a very fine sarai at great expense just outside the principal gate, that towards Ludhiana. The old wall of the city is in good repair, and there are two large pukka tanks outside.\n\nThe town of Raikot is situated in the Jagraon tahsil, 24 miles, by a direct line to the south-west of Ludhiana; and connected with it by a metalled road, a branch from that to Ferozepur which it leaves just beyond Dakhla, about the 13th mile.\n\nThe population of Raikot as ascertained at the enumerations of 1868, 1875 and 1881 is shown below:\n\n| Limits of Enumeration | Year of Census | Persons | Males | Females |\n|-----------------------|---------------|---------|-------|--------|\n| Whole town            | 1868          | 9,165   | 4,773 | 4,392  |\n|                       | 1875          | 9,219   | 4,783 | 4,436  |\n| Municipal limits      | 1868          | 9,165   | 4,773 | 4,392  |\n|                       | 1875          | 9,219   | 4,783 | 4,436  |\nThe figures for the population within municipal limits according to the Census of 1868 are taken from the published tables of the Census of 1875; but it was noted at the time that their accuracy was in many cases doubtful. The constitution of the population by religion and the number of occupied houses are shown in Table No. XLIII. Details of sex will be found in Table XX of the Census Report of 1881. Raikot has thus a population of 9,219; but is not a place of very great importance. Of the population about one-half is agricultural, as there is a very large village area (nearly 8,000 acres) attached to it. This land was cultivated from of old, being divided between six villages; but 230 years ago (so says the family history) Rai Ahmad, moving from Talwandi, the former seat of the family, made the place the head-quarters of his territory, and called it Raikot. The scattered villages were collected into one town, and a commercial class assembled. The followers of the Rais would of themselves have been a large addition to the population of any place, as there must always have been a large army maintained. Raikot declined in importance on the overthrow of the Rais; but there is still a certain amount of local trade carried on by residents of the Khatri, Bhabra, &c., tribes. This is principally in grain from the villages to the south, the agriculturists taking in return clothes, brass dishes, salt, &c. The population has remained stationary during the last twelve years; and there are no signs that the place is developing, although the situation should give it the command of the trade from the Jangal, which at present goes straight through to Ludhi\u00e1na. A good road opened towards Sahna would probably make some difference. The average of octroi receipts for the last seven years is 2,787; and the Municipality is of the third class. The town has, like Jagraon, a Middle School, in which English and Vernacular are taught, and a Police Station, but no regular dispensary. The town is surrounded by a brick wall, ruinous in parts. The principal places of interest are the palaces of Rais, now in the possession of Im\u00e1m Bakhsh, the adopted son of the last R\u00e1ni, who resides here. These buildings are mostly dilapidated.\n\nThe town of M\u00e1chiw\u00e1ra (tahs\u00edl Samr\u00e1la) lies on the ridge over the Budha, 20 miles to the east of Ludhi\u00e1na, on the old Rupar Road. A metalled road connects it with Samr\u00e1la, the tahs\u00edl head-quarters, whence there is also a metalled road to Ludhi\u00e1na; and although the distance is 26 miles, all traffic goes round this way.\n\nThe population as ascertained at the enumerations of 1868, 1875 and 1881 is shown below:\n\n| Limits of Enumeration | Year of Census | Persons | Males | Females |\n|-----------------------|---------------|---------|-------|---------|\n| Whole town            | 1868          | 9,062   | 3,304 | 2,758   |\n|                       | 1875          | 9,067   | 3,271 | 2,696   |\n| Municipal limits      | 1868          | 9,062   |       |         |\n|                       | 1875          | 9,067   |       |         |\n|                       | 1881          | 9,067   |       |         |\nThe figures for the population within municipal limits according to the Census of 1868 are taken from the published tables of the Census of 1875; but it was noted at the time that their accuracy was in many cases doubtful. It is, however, by no means improbable that the decrease shown by the figures is real, as the position of the town on the Budha nala or old bed of the Sutlej makes it very unhealthy. The constitution of the population by religion and the number of occupied houses are shown in Table No. XLIII. Details of sex will be found in Table XX of the Census Report of 1881. The town has thus a population of 5,967, of which a large portion is agricultural, the village area being 4,800 acres. M\u00e1chiw\u00e1ra may have stood in Hindu times, as a place of the name is mentioned in the Mahabharat; but it is doubtful if it can claim greater antiquity than that allowed by the account that it was founded 800 years ago under the Ghorian dynasty, like Ludhi\u00e1na, on the south bank of the Sutlej. The name means \"the place of fishers,\" and is common all along the river. It was under the Ghori dynasty that the Rajputs first settled in this part of the country. The town has a considerable trade in sugar, the r\u00e1b of the B\u00e9t coming into it for manufacture into khand or bura (a coarse brown sugar). Some account of this trade will be found in the Note on Sugar appended to the Settlement Report, and Mr. Walker estimated the annual value of the exports of sugar and syrup at 1 to 1\u00bd lakhs of rupees. There is a considerable commercial class composed of Khatris, Banias, and Suds, engaged in money-lending business with the villagers about, principally with the Muhammadans of the B\u00e9t. The sugar trade is mostly carried on by the Khatris, who combine it with money-lending, taking payment in r\u00e1b, which they refine into khand, &c. The town has a third class Municipality with an average income of Rs. 3,332, of which about 1,000 is levied on the r\u00e1b brought in for manufacture. The streets are good, well paved, and clean. The public institutions are a Police Station, a Dispensary and a Middle School, where English and Vernacular are taught. As in Ludhi\u00e1na there is a terrible amount of sickness in the autumn, and for two months most of the inhabitants suffer from fever. Under the Sikhs M\u00e1chiw\u00e1ra was the head-quarters of the Sodhis; and they have left a large brick fort, now partly occupied by the Police Station, and a Diw\u00e1nkh\u00e1na or Court.\n\nKhanna (tahsil Samr\u00e1la) is a small town on the Sindh, Punjab and Delhi Railway, 26 miles south-east of Ludhi\u00e1na. It has no particular history; but in Sikh times was the seat of one of the petty Chiefs amongst whom the country was divided. The last representative of the race was M\u00e1i Dai\u00e1n Kour, on whose death in 1850 the large j\u00e1gir of the family lapsed. The family had a masonry fort, mostly demolished now, but of which portions still remain.\n\nThe population as ascertained at the enumerations of 1868, 1875 and 1881 is shown on the next page.\nThe figures for the population within municipal limits according to the Census of 1868 are taken from the published tables of the Census of 1875; but it was noted at the time that their accuracy was in many cases doubtful. It would appear from information supplied by the Deputy Commissioner that the Census of 1868 did not include the sarai and encamping ground; while the opening of the Railway and the consequent considerable export of grain that has grown up sufficiently account for the increase.\n\nThe constitution of the population by religion and the number of occupied houses are shown in Table No. XLIII. Details of sex will be found in Table XX of the Census Report of 1881. Since the opening of the railway in 1870 Khanna has increased in importance, and there is a rising trade in grain and cotton (exports); salt, iron, &c. (imports). The railway station is a good one, and large consignments of grain come up from the N\u00e1bha and other territories which lie to the south. The population increased from 3,408 in 1868 to 3,988 in 1881 (17 per cent.), and it is to be expected that there will be a further development. The average octroi income for seven years was Rs. 4,003, the increase being from 1,468 in 1876 to 4,385 in 1882. There is at present no good road to the south, and most of the trade comes on camels, donkeys, &c. The town is very healthy; and has good clean b\u00e1z\u00e1s, very wide for a native town. The houses are unpretentious, being mostly of one storey, and many of sun-dried bricks only; and there is not much actual wealth in the place as yet. A large portion of the population is agricultural. There is a Municipal Committee of the third class, a Police Station outside at the encamping ground, and a Vernacular Middle School. The only objects of interest are the ruins of the old fort and of an Imperial sarai built in the time of Aurangzeb.\n\nBahlolpur is situated on the ridge over the Budha, seven miles east of M\u00e1chiw\u00e1ra and 27 from Ludhi\u00e1na. It was founded in the reign of the Emperor Akbar by Bahlol Kh\u00e1n and Bah\u00e1dar Kh\u00e1n, Afgh\u00e1ns (Kh\u00e1nz\u00e1da), whose descendants still reside and own land in the village area attached to the town; but have sunk into obscurity. It is now a place of no importance and has all the appearances of decay, though, when there was a brisk trade on the river which it overlooked, the town must have been flourishing.\n\nThe population as ascertained at the enumerations of 1868, 1875 and 1881 is as follows:\u2014\nThe figures for the population within municipal limits according to the Census of 1868 are taken from the published tables of the Census of 1875; but it was noted at the time that their accuracy was in many cases doubtful. It would appear, however, that the decrease is real. The Deputy Commissioner writes: \"The steady decay of the place may be attributed to two causes\u2014the first is that during the Sikh rule a number of Path\u00e1ns of Bahlolpur served in the Rajwars, and brought wealth and plunder to the place; but since our rule these men have given up service and have been living on their savings. The second cause is that the health of this town is very bad on account of a large jhil formed by the Budha n\u00e1la close under its walls.\"\n\nThe constitution of the population by religion and the number of occupied houses are shown in Table No. XLIII. Details of sex will be found in Table XX of the Census Report of 1881. The average octroi income is Rs. 1,380; but the trade, principally in sugar (khand), is insignificant. There are a good many resident money-lenders (Khatris and B\u00e1nias) who have dealings with the people of the B\u00e9t. The town is very unhealthy, like M\u00e1chiw\u00e1ra, from its situation. There are a number of old tombs about the town.\n\nSome of the more important of the villages may be mentioned. Sahna, (population 4,080), is situated 54 miles south-west of Ludhi\u00e1na. This is the largest of the Jangal villages, and the original seat of the Malaudh family, who have a very large fort in it. The inhabitants are almost all of the agricultural class, and the houses of sun-dried bricks. There is a b\u00e1z\u00e1r with a few ordinary shops. There are seventeen lambard\u00e1rs or village headmen. A Police Station has lately been established here. Raipur (population 3,747) eleven miles south of Ludhi\u00e1na, is the chief village of the Garew\u00e1l Jats, who had some local authority at the close of last century. The houses are almost all built of burnt bricks. The population is mostly agricultural; but there are a good many shops in the b\u00e1z\u00e1r. The village has twelve headmen. Of Tih\u00e1ra (population 1,143) mention has already been made. It is situated in the north-west extremity of the district on the high bank over the river. The present inhabitants are the ordinary agricultural and miscellaneous population of five or six villages (called Tarafs), who are collected together in a common site like the people of the Agw\u00e1rs of Jagraon. There is also a fair b\u00e1z\u00e1r with a number of shops. The old town has\nlong since disappeared into the river, and there are no traces of it now. *Sahnewal* (population 1,988), a station on the Sindh, Punjab and Delhi Railway, nine miles south-east of Ludhi\u0101na, may develop into a place of some little importance. A good bazar is springing up. *Malaudh*, the residence of one of the branches of the family of Sard\u0101rs, which derives its name from the place, has a small trading community and a good bazar. The population is 2,849. There are some other very large villages, such as *Kaonke* (3,608), *Bassian* (2,962), but the population of these is entirely agricultural.\nSTATISTICAL TABLES\nAPPENDED TO THE\nGAZETTEER\nOF THE\nLUDHIANA DISTRICT.\n\n(INDEX ON REVERSE).\n\n\"ARTA PRESS,\" LAHORE.\n## STATISTICAL TABLES\n\n| Page | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| I.\u2014Leading statistics | Frontispiece. |\n| II.\u2014Development | iii |\n| III.\u2014Annual rainfall | ib. |\n| IIIA.\u2014Monthly | iv |\n| IIIB.\u2014Seasonal | ib. |\n| IV.\u2014Temperature | ib. |\n| V.\u2014Distribution of population | v |\n| VI.\u2014Migration | ib. |\n| VII.\u2014Religion and Sex | vi |\n| VIII.\u2014Language | ib. |\n| IX.\u2014Major castes and tribes | vii |\n| IXA.\u2014Minor | ib. |\n| X.\u2014Civil condition | viii |\n| XI.\u2014Births and deaths | ib. |\n| XI.A.\u2014(monthly, all causes) | ib. |\n| XI.B.\u2014(fever) | ib. |\n| XII.\u2014Infirmitics | ib. |\n| XIII.\u2014Education | ib. |\n| XIV.\u2014Surveyed and assessed areas | ib. |\n| XV.\u2014Tenures from Government | x |\n| XVI.\u2014not from Government | xi |\n| XIX.\u2014Land acquired by Government | xii |\n| XX.\u2014Crop areas | ib. |\n| XXI.\u2014Rent rates and yield | xiii |\n| XXII.\u2014Live Stock | xiii |\n| XXIII.\u2014Occupations | xiv |\n| XXIV.\u2014Manufactures | ib. |\n| XXVL.\u2014Retail prices | xv |\n| XXVII.\u2014Price of labour | xvi |\n| XXVIII.\u2014Revenue collections | ib. |\n| XXIX.\u2014Land revenue | ib. |\n| XXX.\u2014Assigned revenue | xvii |\n| XXXI.\u2014Balances, remissions, &c. | ib. |\n| XXXII.\u2014Sales and mortgages of land | xviii |\n| XXXIII.\u2014Stamps and registration | ib. |\n| XXXIII.A.\u2014Registration | xix |\n| XXXIV.\u2014License tax | ib. |\n| XXXV.\u2014Excise | ib. |\n| XXXVI.\u2014District funds | xx |\n| XXXVII.\u2014Schools | ib. |\n| XXXVIII.\u2014Dispensaries | xxI |\n| XXXIX.\u2014Civil and revenue litigation | ib. |\n| XL.\u2014Criminal trials | xxii |\n| XLI.\u2014Police inquiries | ib. |\n| XLII.\u2014Gaols | xxiii |\n| XLIII.\u2014Population of towns | ib. |\n| XLIV.\u2014Births and deaths (towns) | xxiv |\n| XLV.\u2014Municipal income | ib. |\n| XLVL.\u2014Polymetrical table | xxv |\nTable No. II, showing DEVELOPMENT.\n\n| Details          | 1859-64 | 1869-70 | 1873-74 | 1878-79 |\n|------------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Population       |         |         |         | 619,835 |\n| Cultivated acres |         |         |         | 716,194 |\n| Irrigated acres  |         |         |         | 419,972 |\n| Ditto (from Government works) |         |         |         |         |\n| Assessed Land Revenue, rupees |         |         |         | 7,00,000 |\n| Revenue from land, rupees |         |         |         | 7,68,185 |\n| Gross revenue, rupees |         |         |         | 10,49,704 |\n| Number of kine   |         |         |         |         |\n| Sheep and goats  |         |         |         |         |\n| Cattle           |         |         |         |         |\n| Miles of metalled roads |         |         |         |         |\n| Unmetalled roads |         |         |         |         |\n| Railways         |         |         |         |         |\n| Police staff     |         |         |         |         |\n| Prisoners convicted | 722    | 1,117   | 1,048   | 1,311   |\n| Civil suits\u2014number | 3,150  | 2,411   | 3,869   | 5,006   |\n| \u2014value in rupees | 2,90,000 | 3,71,091 | 1,62,111 | 8,13,969 |\n| Municipalities\u2014number |         |         |         |         |\n| \u2014income in rupees |         |         |         |         |\n| Dispensaries\u2014number of |         |         |         |         |\n| \u2014patients        |         |         |         |         |\n| Schools\u2014number of |         |         |         |         |\n| \u2014scholars        |         |         |         |         |\n\nNote.\u2014These figures are taken from Tables Nos.

Previous to that year, boys attending the Upper Primary Department were included in the returns of Middle Schools in the case of institutions under the immediate control of the Education Department, whilst in institutions under District Officers, boys attending both the Upper and Lower Primary Departments were included in Middle Schools. In the case of Aided Institutions, a High School included the Middle and Primary Departments attached to it; and a Middle School, the Primary Department. Before 1873-40, those schools, Government Schools, if supported on the grant-in-aid system, were classified as Aided Schools; in the returns for 1873-40 and subsequent years they have been shown as Government Schools. Branches of English Schools, whether Government or Aided, that were formerly included amongst Vernacular Schools, are now returned as English Schools. Hence the returns before 1873-40 do not afford the means of making a satisfactory comparison with the statistics of subsequent years.\n\nIndigenous Schools and Jail Schools are not included in these returns.\nTable No. XXXVIII, showing the working of DISPENSARIES.\n\n| Name of Dispensary | Class of Dispensary | Number of Patients Treated |\n|--------------------|---------------------|----------------------------|\n|                    |                     | Men | Women | Children |\n| Ludhiana           | 1st                 |     |       |         |\n| Jagran             | 2nd                 |     |       |         |\n| Machiwara          | 2nd                 |     |       |         |\n| Total              |                     |     |       |         |\n\nNote.\u2014These figures are taken from Tables Nos.
