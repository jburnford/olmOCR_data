Thomas Digby Wright of a silver watch.\u2014The prosecutor said he resided at Radley college, Abingdon, Berks, and had been doing duty at St. Luke's, Bethnal-green. On Tuesday he was passing through High-street, Aldgate, when he met a procession of men on strike. The mob following was considerable, and witness trying to get through found himself hemmed in, and when he got out he found his watch had been stolen. He did not recognise the prisoners, but a witness deposed that he saw the prisoners and three other men surround the prosecutor, and Briggs and Smith having got him fixed by the others Briggs put his right hand under his left arm, and so covered drew out the prosecutor's watch. He then passed it to Smith, and the five men went on after the procession. The witness said he followed the gang and pointed them out to three policemen, who said they could not do anything. He continued to follow them for an hour and a-half till they entered a public-house in the City-road, and there they were apprehended.\u2014The prisoners, who denied the charge, were remanded.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3206269950.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 1798, "total-output-tokens": 327, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 1345, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
