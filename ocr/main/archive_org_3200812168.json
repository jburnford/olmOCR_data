Mr. Hilton, barrister, London, prosecuted for the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children.\n\nMargaret Roberts, of 61, Maesdyre Mold, said: On June 5th I entered the service of the defendants at Sunnyside, Upton Park, as general servant. I remained there until September 8th. During the time I was there I noticed the conduct of the defendants towards the two little boys. They were most cruel to the children; five days after my arrival I saw Mrs. Phelan pull Ernest by the hair in the bath by the hair of his head and take him out by his hair. The child stood on the floor, and she took hold of his hair and lifted him into the bath. This was repeated nearly every morning during the whole time I was there. As a rule in the daytime Ernest was placed on the lawn tied to his chair with a strap round his waist and a strap tied to the chair. Once I went downstairs after bathing the children, and heard the younger boy screaming. I went back upstairs and saw Mrs. Phelan, with an ivory hair-brush, strike Ernest on the head until the brush broke in two. It was a very severe blow\u2014in fact, it was a number of blows. There were five or six blows on the head, and then the brush broke. The child cried very much, and the marks were on the child's head until 9th July. On September 4th the occurrence happened taking place in July. I saw Mr. Phelan Encourage with a dog-whip twice. Ernest was without clothes at the time he was beaten. At another time I saw Mr. Phelan beat Ernest with the buckle-end of the body strap; the elder child was also beaten by both Mr. and Mrs. Phelan, but not so often as the younger one. I left in September, partly because I could not get sufficient food, but mainly because I could not bear to see the children beaten.\n\nAnn Chamberlain, charwoman, said she used to go to Sunnyside on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays. Every day she was there the children were ill-treated. Mrs. Ann Griffiths, qualified midwife, stated that Mrs. Phelan was confined on September 4th, and she attended her. The first day witness went to the house Mrs. Phelan was bathing the children, and she took hold of Ernest by the hair of his head and suspended him while she poured cold water on him till he was exhausted. She then put him on the bed and knocked him on the head several times with her fist. Ernest was generally strapped to the chair on the lawn after his bath, and left there till seven or eight in the evening. Ernest was generally strapped in bed, and one night when the witness did not put the strap round him because she thought it was cruel, Mrs. Phelan struck him on the head. She promised several times beat Ernest with a dog-whip and strap. One occasion when he used the buckle-end of the strap. The child was restless all night, and next morning witness found his buttocks were black and blue. Mrs. Phelan, when spoken to about her conduct, said she would not bring her children up like other children; she did not believe in spoiling them, and would knock it out of them. The children had castor oil given to them nearly every day, and on September 1st, when giving Augustus the oil, Mrs. Phelan pushed the spoon down his mouth, turned him round, threw him on the floor and held him there, keeping his mouth closed until he was black in the face; he could not breathe, and blood came out of his mouth; he afterwards vomited blood. Witness considered the children did not have half enough to eat.\n\nPolice-inspector Pearson stated that when he arrived the prisoners Mrs. Phelan asked if they were charged with ill-treating both children, and on being answered in the affirmative she said to her husband, \"I told you they would do something. I suppose they want more money.\"\n\nDr. Manni said that he examined the children, and found a number of bruises and abrasions on their bodies. Dr. Archer gave confirmatory evidence.\n\nThe Bench committed defendants to take their trial at the Quarter Sessions on Thursday next. Mr. and Mrs. Phelan were hosted as they drove off in a cab to Upton Park. The children will remain for the present in the custody of the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3200812168.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 602, "total-output-tokens": 1033, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 4450, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
