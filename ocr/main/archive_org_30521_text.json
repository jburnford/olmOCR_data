The length of this short cut from the Wynad taluk limit to Tharavannah Rest-house is 1\u00bc miles and to Koroth Bungalow is \u00be miles.\n\n(2) As regards the Wynad taluk, the miles noted in column 4 are the distances to the bungalows from the points where the roads Nos. 3 and 4 start in Tellicherry or Calicut respectively. Therefore the distances from these points to the Railway stations will have to be added to this or subtracted from it as the case may be, to arrive at the distance from Railway Stations to the Travellers' bungalows.\n\nMAL. 3\n| Taluka                  | Hindus Total | Males | Females | Muslims Total | Males | Females | Christians Total | Males | Females | Others Total | Males | Females
