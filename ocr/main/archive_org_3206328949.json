He was now, however, a member of the English bar. The defendant was at present an inspector of the Portsmouth Borough police, but at the time the offence was committed with which he (Harvey) was charged he was a detective sergeant of the Portsmouth police. He should charge the defendant also with others unknown with conspiring to defeat the ends of justice by preventing witnesses attending to give evidence in the divorce case of \"Gladstone v. Gladstone.\" He thought it right the defendant should know there were other charges against him. At the time the defendant was a detective-sergeant at Portsmouth he was employed by the solicitors to Mrs. Gladstone, the petitioner in the divorce case, as a kind of private inquiry officer. He called upon witnesses on the other side, and did all he could to dissuade them from giving evidence. With regard to the matter in the summons, he should prove that Francis Colville was subpoenaed to give evidence in 1875 in the case of \"Gladstone v. Gladstone\" at the Divorce court, in which the Queen's Proctor intervened. Mrs. Gladstone at first obtained a decree nisi. The day before Colville gave evidence he was followed on to a tramcar in the Westminster-road by the defendant. Whilst on the car, on the way to Woolwich, the defendant called Colville by a nickname he was known by. He ultimately asked him if he was a witness in the case of Gladstone, and upon telling him he was, he asked him to tell him all about it, and handed him either two florins or two half-crowns. Colville told defendant he could speak as to an act of adultery by Mr. Gladstone. Defendant told him not to say anything about it as it would do him no good. They afterwards went to a public-house at Greenwich, and defendant treated him to drink, and told him it would be better for him to move back to London. He declined, however, and went on to Woolwich. The defendant was getting up evidence on behalf of Mrs. Gladstone. He would call evidence in regard to the summons before the Court that day, and then ask for an adjournment, with regard to other matters, which would include that of conspiracy.\n\nFrancis Colville, who said he was a bombardier in H battery of the 2nd Brigade Royal artillery, residing at Woolwich, gave evidence bearing out the statement of Mr. Smyth, and in cross-examination said\u2014I resided at the Westminster Palace hotel during the time the trial lasted. I was with witnesses who appeared on behalf of the Queen's Proctor. There might have been some 25 of them. I knew defendant by sight, but did not then know his name. It was immediately after I told defendant I had business in London that he gave me the money. I was surprised rather, but I had no idea what it was meant for. I said nothing before giving my evidence to the Queen's Proctor as to the interview with defendant, and what had transpired. I did not tell Captain Gladstone.\u2014The case was then adjourned.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3206328949.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 602, "total-output-tokens": 802, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 3504, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
