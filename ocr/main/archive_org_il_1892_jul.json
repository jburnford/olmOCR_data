The Commissioners may, however, in their discretion, at any time prior to the grant of the Certificate of Qualification hereinafter referred to, institute such further inquiries as they may deem necessary; and if the result of such inquiries, in the case of any Candidate, should be unsatisfactory to them in any of the above respects, he will be ineligible for admission to the Civil Service of India, and if already selected, will be removed from the position of a Probationer.\n\n4. The Open Competitive Examination will take place only in the following branches of knowledge:\n\n| Branches of Knowledge | Marks |\n|-----------------------|-------|\n| French Language and Literature | 500 |\n| German ditto, ditto | 500 |\n| English ditto, ditto (including special period named by the Commissioners) (d) | 500 |\n| Sanskrit Language and Literature | 500 |\n| Arabic ditto, ditto | 500 |\n\n(c) An order for admission to the Examination will be sent to each Candidate on the 18th July.\n\n(b) For the method of distribution see No. i. of the announcements on page x.\n\n(c) The fee (\u00a35) will be payable by means of a special stamp according to instructions which will be communicated to Candidates.\n\nMarks.\n\n| Subjects | Marks |\n|----------|-------|\n| English Composition | 500 |\n| Greek Language and Literature | 750 |\n| Latin ditto, ditto | 750 |\n| Mathematics (pure and applied) | 900 |\n| Advanced Mathematical Subjects (pure and applied) | 900 |\n| Natural Sciences, i.e., any number not exceeding three of the following subjects:\u2014Elementary Chemistry and Elementary Physics | 600 |\n| Higher Chemistry | 600 |\n| Higher Physics | 600 |\n| Geology | 600 |\n| Botany | 600 |\n| Zoology | 600 |\n| Animal Physiology | 600 |\n| English History | 500 |\n| Greek History (Ancient, including Constitution) | 400 |\n| Roman History (ditto, ditto) | 400 |\n| General Modern History (period to be selected by Candidates from list issued by Commissioners, one period at least to include Indian History) (e) | 500 |\n| Political Economy and Economic History | 500 |\n| Logic and Mental Philosophy (Ancient and Modern) | 400 |\n| Moral Philosophy (Ancient and Modern) | 400 |\n| Roman Law | 500 |\n| English Law, viz.\u2014Law of Contract.\u2014Criminal Law.\u2014Law of Evidence and Law of the Constitution | 500 |\n| Political Science (including Analytical Jurisprudence, the Early History of Institutions, and Theory of Legislation) | 500 |\n\nCandidates are at liberty to name any or all of these branches of knowledge (f).

The marks assigned to Candidates in each branch will be subject to such deduction as the Civil Service\n\n(d) In the syllabus referred to in Note (f).\n\n(e) See Note (f).\n\n(f) A syllabus, defining in general terms the character of the Examination in the various subjects, may be obtained on application to the Secretary, Civil Service Commission. A copy is also given below.\nCommissioners may deem necessary (g) in order to secure that \"a Candidate be allowed no credit at all for taking up a subject in which he is a mere smatterer.\"\n\n7. The Examination will be conducted on paper and *viva voce*, as may be deemed necessary.\n\n8. The marks obtained by each Candidate, in respect of each of the subjects in which he shall have been examined, will be added up, and the names of the several Candidates who shall have obtained, after the deduction above mentioned, a greater aggregate number of marks than any of the remaining Candidates, will be set forth in order of merit, and such Candidates shall be deemed to be selected Candidates for the Civil Service of India, provided they appear to be in other respects duly qualified. Should any of the selected Candidates become disqualified, the Secretary of State for India will determine whether the vacancy thus created shall be filled up or not. In the former case, the Candidate next in order of merit, and in other respects duly qualified, shall be deemed to be a selected Candidate. A Candidate entitled to be deemed a selected Candidate, but declining to accept the nomination as such, which may be offered to him, will be disqualified for any subsequent competition.\n\n9. Selected Candidates before proceeding to India will be on probation for one year, at the end of which time they will be examined, with a view of testing their progress in the following subjects (h):\n\n**Compulsory**\n\n| Marks |\n|-------|\n| 1.

Political Economy | 400 |\n\n* These subjects may not be offered by any Candidate who has offered them at the previous Examination.\n\nIn this Examination, as in the Open Competition, the merit of the Candidates examined will be estimated by marks (which will be subject to deductions in the same way as the marks assigned at the Open Competition), and the number set opposite to each subject denotes the greatest number of marks that can be obtained in respect of it at any one Examination. The Examination will be conducted on paper and *viva voce*, as may be deemed necessary. This Examination will be held at the close of the year of probation, and will be called the \"Final Examination.\"\n\n10. Candidates will be tested during their probation as to their ability to perform journeys on horseback; and no Candidate will be deemed qualified for the Civil Service of India who fails to satisfy the Civil Service Commissioners of his competence in this respect.\n\n11. The selected Candidates who, at the Final Examination, shall be found to have a competent knowledge of the subjects specified in Regulation 9, and who shall have satisfied the Civil Service Commissioners of their eligibility in respect of nationality, age, health, character and ability to ride, shall be certified by the said Commissioners to be entitled to be appointed to the Civil Service of India, provided they shall comply with the regulations in force, at the time, for that Service.\n\n12. Persons desirous to be admitted as Candidates, must apply on Forms, which may be obtained from \"The Secretary, Civil Service Commission, London, S.W.\" at any time after the 1st December, 1891. The Forms must be returned so as to be received at the office of the Civil Service Commissioners on or before 31st May, 1892 (i).\n\nThe Civil Service Commissioners are authorized by the Secretary of State for India in Council to make the following announcements:\n\n(1.) As regards the distribution of the Selected Candidates to the several Presidencies and Provinces mentioned in Regulation 1, the Selected Candidates will be divided into four groups, each containing 8 Candidates, according to the order in which they stand on the List resulting from the Open Competition (the first 8 in order of Merit composing Group No. 1, the next 8 in order of Merit composing Group No. 2, and so on), and the Members of each Group will be allowed in the order in which they stand, each to choose, so long as a choice remains, one of the appointments allotted to that Group, as indicated in the following Table:\n\n| Appointments allotted to\u2014 |\n|--------------------------|\n| 1st Group, 1-8. | 2nd Group, 9-16. | 3rd Group, 17-24. | 4th Group, 25-32. |\n| Upper Provinces, &c. | Lower Provinces and Assam | Madras | Bombay | Burma |\n| 3 | 4 | 3 | 4 | 14 |\n| 2 | 2 | 2 | 1 | 7 |\n| 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 5 |\n| 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 4 |\n| 1 | \u2014 | 1 | \u2014 | 2 |\n| 8 | 8 | 8 | 8 | 32 |\n\nThe choice thus given, however, will be subject to any other arrangement which the Secretary of State, or the Government of India, may deem necessary.\n\n(2.) Should any appointments have to be made in excess of the 32 notified in the Regulations, they will be added to such group or groups as to the Secretary of State may seem proper.\n\n(3.) No exchange of appointments will be permitted between selected Candidates, who, under par. 1 have made their choice of Presidency or Province, except between those who are members of the same group or of two adjoining groups, who are separated by not more than 10 others in the Order of Merit, on the result of the Open Competition. Application for permission to exchange appointments must be made to the Secretary of State within one month after the date of choice made under par. 1, and in no case will an exchange be permitted unless it is, in the opinion of the Secretary of State, desirable, in the public interest, that it should be made.\n\n(4.) The giving or receiving directly or indirectly any money or other valuable consideration for an exchange will be deemed to vacate the selection and appointment of the Candidates interested.\n\n(5.) Selected Candidates will be required to report\n\n(i) These forms should be accompanied by evidence on the points mentioned in Regulation 2, and by a list of the subjects in which the Candidate desires to be examined. Evidence of health and character must bear date not earlier than 1st May, 1892. Applications for leave to alter or add to the list of subjects named will not be entertained unless received on or before the 5th July, 1892.\ntheir arrival in India within such period after the grant of their Certificate of Qualification as the Secretary of State may in each case direct.\n\n(6.) The seniority in the Civil Service of India of the Selected Candidates will be determined according to the order in which they stand on the list resulting from the combined marks of the Open Competitive and Final Examinations. Candidates selected under these Regulations in 1892, will, in view of the alteration in the limits of age, have seniority over the Candidates selected under the previous Regulations in 1891.\n\n7.) An allowance amounting to \u00a3100 will be given to all Candidates who pass their probation at one of the Universities or Colleges which have been approved by the Secretary of State, viz., the Universities of Oxford, Cambridge, Dublin, Glasgow, Edinburgh, St. Andrews, and Aberdeen; University College, London; and King's College, London; provided such Candidates shall have passed the Final Examination to the satisfaction of the Civil Service Commissioners, and shall have complied with such rules as may be laid down for the guidance of Selected Candidates.\n\n(8.) The allowance of \u00a3100 will not be paid to any Selected Candidate until he has been certified by the Civil Service Commissioners to be entitled to be appointed to the Civil Service of India; and every Certificated Candidate must, before receiving his allowance, attend at the India Office and give a written undertaking to refund the amount in the event of his failing to proceed to India.\n\n(9.) All Candidates obtaining Certificates will be also required to enter into covenants, by which, amongst other things, they will bind themselves to agree to such Regulations for the provision of pensions for their families as may be approved by the Secretary of State for India in Council. The stamps payable on these covenants amount to \u00a31.\n\n(10.) Candidates rejected at the Final Examination of 1893 will in no case be allowed to present themselves for re-examination.\n\nSYLLABUS,\n\nSHOWING THE EXTENT OF THE EXAMINATION IN CERTAIN SUBJECTS AT THE OPEN COMPETITION FOR ADMISSION INTO THE INDIAN CIVIL SERVICE IN 1892.\n\nThe Regulations governing the Open Competition for admission into the Indian Civil Service, have been framed with a view to the principle regarded by Lord Macaulay's Committee, in 1854, as essential, viz., that the object of the Competition should be to secure for the Indian Civil Service officers who \"have received the best, the most liberal, the most finished education that their native country affords.\" The scheme of examination has accordingly been made to embrace most of the subjects of the Honour Schools in the Universities of Great Britain and Ireland. In administering the scheme, the Civil Service Commissioners, concurring with Lord Macaulay's Committee in the opinion, \"that no Candidate who may fail should, to whatever calling he may betake himself, have reason to regret the time and labour which he has spent in preparing himself to be examined,\" desire to avoid all disturbance of the general course of University studies, and to render it possible, with due regard for the principle of Open Competition, for those who have graduated with honours at the Universities, to attend the examination for the Indian Civil Service with good prospects of success. The appended Syllabus shows in outline the intentions of the Commissioners with regard to the extent and character of the examination in those subjects which seem to require further definition. The scope of the examination in the subjects not mentioned in the Syllabus is sufficiently defined in the scheme published in the Regulations themselves. The Examiners will be instructed to keep the standard in each subject up to the level of the highest course of study pursued in the Universities.\n\nEnglish Composition.\u2014An Essay to be written on one of several subjects specified by the Civil Service Commissioners on their Examination Paper.\n\nEnglish Language and Literature.\u2014The Examination will be in two parts. In the one the Candidates will be expected to show a general acquaintance with the course of English Literature, as represented (mainly) by the following writers in verse and prose, between the reign of Edward III., and the accession of Queen Victoria:\n\nVerse\u2014Chaucer, Langland, Spenser, Shakespeare, Milton, Dryden, Pope, Gray, Collins, Johnson, Goldsmith, Crabbe, Cowper, Campbell, Wordsworth, Scott, Byron, Coleridge, Shelley, Keats.\n\nProse\u2014Bacon, Sir Thomas Browne, Milton, Swift, Defoe, Addison, Johnson, Burke, Scott, Southey.\n\nA minute knowledge of the works of these authors will not be looked for in this part of the Examination, which will, however, test how far the Candidates have studied the chief productions of the greatest English writers in themselves, and are acquainted with the leading characteristics of their thought and style, and with the place which each of them occupies in the history of English literature. Candidates will also be expected to show that they have studied in these authors the history of the English language in respect of its vocabulary, syntax, and prosody.\n\nThe other part of the Examination will relate to one of the periods named below, which will follow each other year by year in the order indicated.\n\n1. A.D. 1340 to A.D. 1600 (1894) [Chaucer to Spenser]\n2. A.D. 1600 to A.D. 1700 (1893) [Shakespeare to Dryden]\n3. A.D. 1700 to A.D. 1800 (1894) [Pope to Cowper]\n4. A.D. 1800 to A.D. 1832 (1895) [Nineteenth Century writers to the death of Scott]\n\nThe Examination in this part will require from Candidates a more minute acquaintance with the history of the English language and literature, as illustrated in the chief works produced in each period, and will be based to a considerable extent, but by no means exclusively, on certain books specified each year by the Commissioners.* The names placed under the dates are intended to suggest the general character of the literary development of the period, and consequently the natural limits of the Examination. All the works of Shakespeare, for example, will be regarded as falling within the second period; all the works of Swift within the third; all the works of Scott and Wordsworth within the last.\n\nFrench Language and Literature.\u2014Translation from French into English, and from English into French; Critical questions on the French Language and Literature.\n\nGerman Language and Literature.\u2014As in French.\n\nLatin Language and Literature.\u2014Translation from Latin into English; Composition in Prose and Verse (in the place of the latter may be taken, by those who prefer it, a paper of critical questions on the style of the Latin orators and poets, based on Cicero, De Oratore, and Quintilian, Institutiones Oratoriae Lib. x.); Critical Questions on the Latin Language and Literature.\n\nGreek Language and Literature.\u2014Translation from\n\n* The books for 1892 are:\u2014\n\nChaucer: Prologue to the Canterbury Tales; The Flower and the Leaf; The Assembly of Foules; Minor Poems.\n\nLangland: Vision of Piers Plowman.\n\nSpenser: Faery Queen, Books I, II; Shepherd's Kalendar.\n\nSir John Mandeville's Travels.\n\nSir Thomas More's Utopia.\nGreek into English.

(See separate paper.)\n\nChaplains must proceed to their destination within four months from the date of their nomination by the Secretary of State; and if they fail to do so, without leave obtained from the Secretary of State their appointments will lapse. A free passage will be provided by the India Office, subject, however, to the condition, that if the Chaplain, within three years, on grounds other than certified ill health, relinquishes his appointment, or is removed from it for misconduct, he will refund the cost of such passage. The salary will not commence until arrival in India. Chaplains must intimate to the India Office the proposed date of their departure, in order that their passages may be secured and a Certificate of their appointment be furnished to them. Chaplains will be on probation only, for three years; and, if confirmed in their appointment at the end of that period, they will be admitted as Junior Chaplains. They will be required, from the date of their appointment on probation, to provide pensions for their families under the Indian Service Family Pension Regulations, a copy of which can be obtained on application to the Government in India or to the Director of Funds, India Office. These pensions are in addition to any pensions or compassionate allowances granted under the Royal Pay Warrant for the time being in force.\n\nThe Bishop of London, to whom the Secretary of State usually refers all nominations, requires the candidates to forward the following documents to his Lordship's Secretary (Harry W. Lee, Esq., 2, The Sanctuary, Westminster), one month before his approval of such appointment is required:\n\n1. \u2020Certificate of nomination by the Secretary of State\n\n2. \u2020Letters of Orders\u2014Deacon and Priest.\n\n3. Testimonial, in the form on the next page.\n\n4. Statement of the cure or cures in which the Chaplain has been engaged.\n\n5. The names of two or three private referees (clerical).\n\nThe salaries of Chaplains are:\u2014Senior, rupees 9,600 per annum; Junior, rupees 6,000 per annum; Chaplains on probation, rupees 4,800 per annum. A Junior Chaplain becomes a Senior Chaplain after ten years' service, excluding the period of probation.\n\nThe retiring pay of Chaplains is regulated by the following scale:\u2014\n\nAfter 23 years' service, with an actual residence in India of 20 years, including the period of probatoin \u00a3365 per annum.\n\nOn Medical Certificate after 18 years' actual residence in India, including the period of probation \u00a3292 0 0 .\n\nDitto after 13 years' ditto 173 7 6\n\nDitto after 10 years' ditto 127 15 0\n\n* A clergyman resident in India at the time of his nomination as a probationer will be allowed to count in his probationary period any service rendered by him under the Additional Clergy Society or other service approved by the Government in India, but he will not be entitled to any gratuity in respect of such service if compelled (for whatever cause) to relinquish his position during the probationary period, nor be allowed to count for furlough or gratuity his period of service in India prior to his nomination as a probationer.\n\n\u2020 The Certificate will be sent direct from the India Office to his Lordship.\n\n\u2021 The Letters of Orders to be sent to the India Office, and thence direct to his Lordship.\nTO THE INDIAN CIVIL SERVICE.\n\nFORM OF TESTIMONIAL.\n\nTo the Right Reverend Frederick Lord Bishop of London.\n\nWe, whose names are under written, testify and make known that C.D., clerk, A.M. (or other degree), appointed a Chaplain on probation, on the Indian establishment, hath been personally known to us for the space of three years last past; that we have had opportunities of observing his conduct; that during the whole of that time we verily believe that he lived piously, soberly, and honestly; nor have we at any time heard anything to the contrary thereof; nor hath he at any time (as far as we know or believe) held, written, or taught anything contrary to the doctrine or discipline of the Church of England; and moreover, we believe him, in our consciences, to be, as to his moral conduct, a person worthy of the said appointment.\n\nIn witness whereof we have hereunto set our hands, this day of in the year of our Lord 189\n\nTo be signed by three bene-\nficed Clergymen, and to be countersigned by the Bishop of the diocese in which such benefices are situate.\n\nE. F., Rector of\nG. H., Vicar of\nJ. K., Perpetual Curate of\n\nREGULATIONS FOR ADMISSION TO THE ROYAL INDIAN ENGINEERING COLLEGE, COOPER'S HILL (NEAR STAINES).\n\nThe arrangements hereinafter described are subject to revision under the orders of the Secretary of State.\n\n1. The Royal Indian Engineering College is primarily maintained under the orders of the Secretary of State for India in Council, in view to the education of candidates for the service of Government in the Indian Public Works, Telegraph and Forest Department; but it is open, to the extent of the accommodation available, to all persons desirous of following the course of study pursued in it.\n\n2. Candidates for the Indian Forest Department are selected under special arrangements (paras. 37 and 38).\n\n3. Nominations to the Indian Telegraph Department are made from among the Engineer students at the College at the end of their first year of study (paras. 34, 35, 36).\n\n4. About fifty Engineer students are admitted yearly to the College. Candidates for admission must be between the ages of seventeen and twenty-one years on the 1st day of July of the year of admission, and of good moral character; they must have received a good general education, and have attained to a sufficient degree of proficiency in elementary mathematics to enable them to follow the College course with advantage.\n\n5. In the event of there being more qualified candidates for admission than the College can receive, the preference will be given according to dates of application for admission.\n\n6. The collegiate year usually begins in the latter part of September. Applications for admission as Engineer students may be made at any time, but not later than the 15th day of June of the year named for admission, except with the special permission of the President.\n\n7. In every case applications for admission must be made on the prescribed forms, which can be obtained from the Secretary of the College.\n\n8. Candidates whose applications are found satisfactory as to age and character will be required to undergo an examination, to be held at the College, about the last week in June of the year for admission.\n\n9. A fee of \u00a32 will be payable in advance by each candidate accepted for examination. It will be called for early in May.\n\n10. The examination will be in the undermentioned subjects:\u2014\n\n(a.) English Composition, to the extent of being able to write grammatically, and with correct spelling, in a neat and legible hand.\n\n(b.) Mathematics as under, viz.:\u2014\n\nArithmetic.\n\nElementary Plane Trigonometry, including Identities; formulae relating to the sum and difference, and the multiplication and division of Angles; Equations; properties and solution of Triangles, and use of Logarithms.*\n\n11. Candidates will also be required to give evidence of having received a fair general education, by undergoing an examination in some classical or modern language, as well as in history or geography.\n\n12. The President may dispense with the whole or any portion of this examination in the case of a candidate who produces a University Diploma, or other similar certificate granted by a recognised examining body. In all such cases, however, the entrance fee of \u00a32 will be payable.\n\n13. The College course in Engineering extends over three years, that in Forestry over about thirty-four months, and that in Telegraphy (para. 35) over two years. The appointments to the Indian services offered by the Secretary of State for India are awarded on the completion of each course to duly qualified successful candidates, subject to the conditions as to physical fitness described in para. 25.\n\n14. Each annual session begins in September, and is divided into three terms, with vacations of about four weeks at Christmas, two weeks at Easter, and eight weeks in the Summer.\n\n15. An annual charge of \u00a3183 is made for each student, which must be paid in advance to the Bank of England, in three sums of \u00a361 per term. Receivable orders with full directions as to the mode of payment will be forwarded from the India Office, shortly before the fees fall due, to the parents or guardians. A student will not be allowed into residence until his fee has been paid.\n\n16. A deposit of \u00a35 is required from each student on admission to the College, as caution money, to cover charges incurred by him for damage to books, instruments, &c., or any College bills outstanding on leaving the College. When these have been defrayed, the balance standing at his credit will be repaid. This deposit is to be paid with the fee for the first term, making the total payment on that occasion \u00a336.\n\n17. The College fees include all charges for tuition, board, according to the College tariff, and lodging, with washing, and for ordinary medical attendance. Students are required to provide their own class books and drawing instruments. Drawing paper, drawing boards, and surveying instruments, are provided by the College.\n\n18. The subjects of study at the College are:\u2014\n\nDescriptive Engineering.\nSurveying.\nArchitecture.\n\n* Todhunter's treatise, or any similar work, will be sufficient.\n\n\u2020 To the extent, for example, cf Todhunter's Trigonometry for Beginners. Importance will be attached to arithmetical accuracy both in Mensuration and in Trigonometry.\nGeometrical Drawing.\nEstimating and Accounts\nExercises in Design.\nWorkshop Practice.\nMechanical Laboratory.\nApplied Mechanics.\nPure and Applied Mathematics.\n*Chemistry (Theoretical and Practical).\n*Physics (Mathematical and Practical).\n*Geology and Mineralogy.\n*French.\n*German.\n*Frechand Drawing.\nBotany\nEntomology } For Forest Students only.\nForestry\nTelegraph Construction } For Telegraph Students\nTelegraph Signalling only.\n\n19. The proficiency of the students in the studies pursued is tested by periodical examinations, and by assigning values to the drawings, surveys, notes, &c., executed by them while at the College.\n\n20. The subjects enumerated in para. 18 are grouped in certain main branches of study, and a fixed minimum of qualification is required in each branch, as well as a certain minimum of average proficiency in all the branches taken together, as tested by the aggregate marks gained, in order to obtain the ordinary College diploma (see para. 22). But Engineer students are encouraged to pursue more particularly those branches of study beyond the limits of the obligatory course for which they may show special aptitude. Superior attainments will be recognised by special diplomas. (See para. 22.)\n\n21. A final examination will be held during the last year of the course, with the assistance of special examiners not connected with the College. This final examination, in addition to paper work and viv\u0101 voce questioning, will embrace exercises in surveying, drawing, designing, and estimating, which will occupy some weeks in execution.\n\n22. Engineer students, not exceeding three in number in any year, who pass out of the College with special distinction will be appointed honorary \"Fellows of Cooper's Hill.\" The Diploma of \"Associate\" will be bestowed on all others who pass out in the first class in one at least of the branches mentioned in para. 18. All others who come up to the prescribed standard of qualification will receive the ordinary diploma of the College.\n\n23. Every student will be required to conform to the College rules, to exhibit due diligence in his studies throughout his course, and to give evidence of satisfactory progress at the different examinations, failing which, or in the event of serious personal misconduct, he will not be allowed to remain at the College.\n\nIndian Public Works Appointments.\n\n24. The Secretary of State for India offers annually a number of appointments in the Indian Public Works Department for competition among the students of the College. If possible, the precise number will be notified four years beforehand, that is about a year before the students concerned enter the College.\n\n25. Those students who have reached the prescribed standard of qualification, being British subjects, of sound constitution, and free from any serious physical defects which would render them unfit for employment in the Public Works Department of India (the final decision on which point will rest with the Secretary of State for India), will be eligible for these appointments in their order of standing after the final examination.\n\n26. The passed students thus selected will be appointed Assistant Engineers, Second Grade, from the 1st October in the year of their passing out of the College, from which date also their service for pension will count. They will be provided with free passages to India, either on leaving the College or after the completion of a course of practical engineering in England, as may be arranged. (See para. 29.)\n\n27. They will be allowed before leaving for India to choose the province and branch of the profession in which they desire to be first employed, according to their position on the list and within the limit of the available vacancies in the different branches, on the understanding, however, that they will be at all times liable to transfer from one province or branch to another at the pleasure of the Government of India, and according to the exigencies of the public service.\n\n28. Certain prescribed departmental and language examinations have to be passed in India, according to the regulations of the service, as a necessary condition for obtaining promotion to a higher grade.\n\n29. Every Assistant Engineer may be required to go through a course of practical engineering, under a civil or mechanical engineer, before proceeding to India. While so employed he will receive pay at the rate of \u00a3150 a year, to commence from the date of entering on the practical course, and in addition will be eligible to receive a premium of from \u00a310 to \u00a325 in each half-year during the course, according to the degree of proficiency and diligence shown. The practical course will commonly last for a year, at the expiration of which the Assistant Engineer, in repeated qualified, will be provided with a free passage to India, and will be entitled to receive his salary at the Indian rate, which is at present Rs. 4,200 per annum from the date of embarkation, unless from any cause he fails to arrive in India within two months from the date appointed for his embarkation, in which case his salary at Indian rates will begin from the date of his arrival in India.\n\n30. The fees to the Engineers under whom the practical course is passed will be paid by the Secretary of State for India. But if the Assistant Engineer voluntarily relinquishes his appointment they will have to be refunded.\n\n31. An Assistant Engineer not making a sufficiently good use of the time passed on the practical course may be liable to be required to go through a further course, without pay, before proceeding to India, or in extreme cases his appointment may be cancelled.\n\n32. The time spent on the practical course will count as service towards pension.\n\n33. If the practical course in England should be dispensed with, the young Engineers will proceed direct to India, and their salaries, at Indian rates, will commence from the date of embarkation, unless from any cause they fail to arrive in India within two months from the date appointed for their embarkation, in which case their salary, as well as their service for pension, will commence from the date of their landing in India, instead of from the date mentioned in para. 26.\n\nIndian Telegraph Appointments.\n\n34. Nominations to the Indian Telegraph Department will also be made from the College, previous notice of the number available being given by advertisement as early as practicable. Students being British subjects, who hold a good place in Branch III. (Mathematics), and are considered fit for employment in the Indian Telegraph Department under the general conditions stated in para. 25, will be eligible for these appointments to the extent of the available vacancies, in their order of standing on the order of merit list at the end of the first year's course.\n\nof State in Council, by Messrs. Churchill & Sons, 11, New Burlington Street, to which attention is specially drawn, since it is important that candidates should place themselves in full possession of information regarding the tests that will be applied.\n\nii The number of appointments in the Indian Telegraph Department offered by the Secretary of State for India to the Students who enter the College in 1892 is 3.\n35. The students thus selected will go through a second year's course of special training at the College, on the satisfactory completion of which they will be appointed to the public service as Assistant Superintendents, Telegraph Department, the commencing salary of which grade is at present Rs. 3,600 a year, with effect from the 1st October in the year of their passing out of the College, from which date also their services for pension will count. They will be provided with free passages to India, and their salaries will commence from the date of embarkation, unless from any cause they fail to arrive in India within two months from the date appointed for their embarkation, in which case both salary and service for pension will count from the date of their landing in India.\n\n36. A student selected for the Indian Telegraph Department under para. 34, who during his year's course of special training does not attain to the prescribed standard of qualification, will be liable to have his appointment cancelled.\n\nIndian Forest Appointments.\n\n37. The candidates selected by the Secretary of State for India for the Indian Forest Department are received in the College for about three years' instruction, and are required to conform to its rules.\n\n38. The method of selection, which is different from that adopted in the case of the Public Works and Telegraph Department candidates, is explained in the Indian Forest Service Prospectus, given below.\n\nGeneral Rules.\n\n39. The College authorities, on application from students, will endeavour to arrange for placing those students who pass out of the College according to the prescribed standard of qualification, but do not enter the Indian service, as pupils for one or two years with Civil or Mechanical Engineers of standing, at moderate rates of premium, payable by the students.\n\n40. Chemical, physical, and mechanical laboratories, a library, gymnasium, and workshops provided with steam power and machinery, are attached to the College. Means are also provided for the practice of photography. Students making use of the laboratories are supplied with the needful apparatus. They are required to provide their own hand tools in the workshop.\n\n41. The responsibility for the discipline and management of the College and for the superintendence of the studies is vested in the President, under the general control of the Secretary of State for India.\n\n42. The students are distributed in divisions, under personal charge of one of the Professors or Instructors selected as tutor by the President, to whom the tutor is responsible for exercising the proper degree of personal supervision over each student in his division and for conducting necessary correspondence with the student's parents or guardians.\n\n43. Each student is provided with a separate room furnished, and with fuel and light, also with the necessary attendance. Furniture and bedding are supplied by the College, but each student is required to supply his own towels and bed linen. Meals are taken in hall. Wine and beer are not included in the ordinary fare, but can be obtained from the College cellar at fixed prices.\n\n44. A chapel is attached to the College, which the students are expected to attend, unless specially exempted.\n\n45. Every student will be required to go through a course of exercise of gymnastics and also military exercises, including the use of the rifle.\n\n46. Students are required to wear academical dress under such regulations as may be prescribed from time to time.\n\n47. Every student selected for any of the Indian Services is required, before proceeding to India, to furnish to the President satisfactory evidence of his competency in riding.\n\nForest Service Branch of the Royal Engineerin College, Cooper's Hill.\n\n[The arrangements hereinafter described are subject to revision under the orders of the Secretary of State for India.]\n\n1. The Royal Indian Engineering College is primarily maintained, under the orders of the Secretary of State for India in Council, for the education of candidates for the service of Government in the India Public Works, Telegraph, and Forest Departments; but it is open, to the extent of the accommodation available to all persons desirous of following the course of study pursued in it.\n\nIndia Forest Department Appointments.\n\n2. The examination usually takes place in June of each year.\n\n3. The number of candidates to be selected annually varies according to the requirements of the Forest Service in India; the figures as regards each particular year will be advertised from time to time. In 1892 there will be 12 appointments offered for competition.\n\n4. Candidates for the Indian Forest Department are selected under the following arrangements:\n\n(a) An applicant must be a natural-born British subject, and must be above 17 and under 20 years of age on the 1st of June of the year in which he competes for an appointment. He must be unmarried, and, if he marries before reaching India, he will forfeit his appointment.\n\n(b) An applicant must send* to the Revenue Department of the India Office, on or before the 1st day of May of the year in which he proposes to compete\u2014\n\n(1) His name and parentage, a certificate, or other satisfactory evidence, of the date of his birth,\n\nand the written consent of parent or guardian, that his name should be recorded as a candidate.\n\n(2) A statement of the places of education at which he may have been since he was nine years old, accompanied by testimonials of good conduct during the last four years.\n\n(c) Applicants will have to appear before a Medical Board at the India Office, particular stress being laid upon good vision and hearing. A physical test will also be imposed, so as to ensure the selection of persons of active habits and powers of endurance.\n\n* There is no form of application; the documents specified in Clauses (1) and (2) should be enclosed in a covering letter addressed to the Secretary, Revenue Department, India Office, London.\n\nWith a view to prevent parents and guardians from incurring the inconvenience and expense of preparing candidates who may be physically unfit for the Forest Service, it is suggested that, before any such preparation is begun, candidates be submitted to examination by the medical adviser of the family, or any other qualified medical practitioner, with regard to the following points:\u2014\n\n1. A weak constitution.\n2. Defective vision.\n3. Impaired hearing.\n4. The existence of any congenital defect.\n\nIt is to be understood that this private examination is merely suggested to lessen the chances of disappointment, and that it is by no means intended to take the place of, or to influence in any way, the official examination. On the subject of the standard of eyesight required for the Indian Services a pamphlet has been published, under the authority of the Secretary of State in Council, by Messrs. Churchill & Sons, 11, New Burlington Street.\n(d) The applicants who have successfully passed the medical examination and the physical tests will be required to undergo an examination before the Civil Service Commissioners in the following subjects (Classes I. to III.) marks being assigned as follows.\n\n**CLASS I.\u2014OBLIGATORY SUBJECTS.**\n\n| Marks |\n|-------|\n| 1.

The course of study for candidates for the India Forest Service extends over about 34 months, divided into nine terms. During the first eight terms, the candidates will prosecute their studies at the College, and during the remaining term they will be instructed, under suitable supervision, in such British or continental forests as may be selected for the purpose. Excursions will also be made for purposes of instruction, both during term time and during part of the vacations. The cost of all such tours or excursions is borne by the Secretary of State (see para. 9).\n\n6. Each annual session begins in September, and is divided into three terms, with vacations of about four weeks at Christmas, two weeks at Easter, and eight weeks in the summer.\n\n7. A charge of \u00a361 for each of the first eight terms and \u00a350 for the ninth term is made for each student; the amount must be paid terminally in advance to the Bank of England. Receivable orders, with full directions as to the mode of payment, will be forwarded from the India Office to the parents or guardians, shortly before the fees fall due. A student will not be allowed to come into residence until his fee has been paid.\n\n8. A deposit of \u00a35 is required to be paid by each student on admission to the College, as caution money, to cover charges incurred by him for damage to books, instruments, &c., or any College bills outstanding on leaving the College. Any balance over and above such charges will be repaid. This deposit is to be paid with the fee for the first term, making the total payment on that occasion \u00a366.\n\n9. The foregoing payments cover all charges for tuition, board, according to the College tariff, lodging, with washing, and ordinary medical attendance while in residence at the College. When students are on tour, and during the course of practical instruction, whether in Great Britain or on the Continent, the Secretary of State will defray the expenses of (1) board, lodging and washing (the maximum expenditure on such account being 10s. per diem), (2) travelling expenses, and (3) fees to local Forest officers, &c.\n\nStudents are required to provide their own class books and drawing instruments. Drawing paper, drawing boards, and surveying instruments are provided by the College.\n\n10. The prescribed course of study at present comprises the following subjects:\n\nI.\u2014Engineering.\n1. Geometrical Drawing.\n2. Freehand Drawing.\n3. Surveying.\n4. Road Construction.\n\nII.\u2014Natural Science.\n1. Inorganic Chemistry.\n2. Chemistry of Soils and Vegetation.\n3. Physics.\n4. Geology and Mineralogy.\n5. Entomology.\n6. Botany.\n\nIII.\u2014Forestry, Theoretical and Practical.\n\nIV.\u2014Miscellaneous.\n1. German.\n2. Elements of law.\n3. Accounts.\n4. Drill and Gymnastics.\n\n---\n\n\u2020 A fee of \u00a34 is required, which can be paid by means of a stamp of that amount. Instructions on this point will be issued to Candidates the day before the Examination.\n\n\u00a7 Attention is invited to the appended Syllabus, giving further details regarding the extent and character of the examination.\n11. Every student is required to conform to the college rules, to exhibit due diligence in his studies throughout the course, and to give evidence of satisfactory progress, in such manner as may be required, failing which or in the event of serious misconduct, he will be liable to be removed from the College, or to be sent back from the forest tour, which may entail the loss of his appointment.\n\n12. During the course of study the proficiency of the students will be tested by periodical examinations, and on the termination of their studies there will be a final examination. Each student may also, at the discretion of the Secretary of State for India, be required to appear before the Medical Board the expiration of the first year of residence at the College, and should the result be unsatisfactory he cannot claim to be allowed to complete the course.\n\n13. The subjects enumerated in paragraph 10 are grouped in certain main branches of study,* and a fixed minimum of qualification is required in each branch and in the subjects taught during the forest tours, as well as a certain minimum for all branches taken together. Students who obtain these minima will receive the College diploma in forestry.\n\n14. Candidates who have obtained this diploma and are found to be of sound constitution and free from physical defects which would render them unsuitable for employment in the Forest Department (the final decision on which points will rest with the Secretary of State for India), will be appointed Assistant Conservators in the Forest Department of India in the order of their standing at the end of the final examination. They will be allowed before leaving the College to choose the provinces in which they desire to be first employed, according to the standing in which they pass out of the College. But this choice can only be exercised according to the available vacancies in the different provinces, and on the understanding that officers are at all times liable to be transferred from one province to another at the pleasure of the Government of India.\n\n15. Within a month of his nomination as Assistant Conservator each nominee must sign articles of agreement describing the terms and conditions of his appointment; he must embark for India when required to do so by the Secretary of State, and will be provided with a free passage. Failure to embark at the stated time will, in the absence of satisfactory explanation, lead to forfeiture of appointment.\n\n16. The pay of an Assistant Conservator of Forests will begin from the date of arrival in India. Probationers who acquitted themselves creditably during their course at Cooper's Hill College will begin on a salary of Rs. 350 a month; those who fail short of the required standard, though they may have obtained the College diploma in Forestry, will begin on Rs. 250 a month; and this difference of salary will continue until the first Departmental Examination is passed in India. It will rest with the President of the College, in consultation with the Principal Professor of Forestry, to decide which probationers, if any, have failed to qualify for the higher initial salary.\n\n17. Promotion, leave, and pension will be regulated by the rules of the Service for the time being. A copy of the Regulations relative to these matters can be seen on application either at the Library or the Record Department of the India Office; the principal rules, however, are contained in the Abstract of the Civil Service Regulations, given in the following thirty-eight pages.\n\n18. Every candidate, before proceeding to India, will be required to furnish to the President of the College satisfactory evidence of his competency in riding.\n\n**General Rules.**\n\n19. Chemical, physical, and botanical laboratories, a forestry museum, a forest nursery, a library, and gymnasium are attached to the College. Means are also provided for the practice of photography. Students making use of the laboratories are supplied with the needful apparatus.\n\n20. The responsibility for the discipline and management of the College and for the superintendence of the studies is vested in the President, under the control of the Secretary of State for India.\n\n21. The students are distributed in divisions, under personal charge of one of the Professors or Instructors selected by the President; such tutor being responsible for exercising the proper degree of personal supervision over each student in his division, and for conducting necessary correspondence with the student's parents or guardians.\n\n22. Each student residing in the College is provided with a separate room, and with fuel and light, also with the necessary attendance. Furniture and bedding are supplied by the College, but each student is required to provide his own towels and bed linen. Meals are taken in hall. Wine and beer are not included in the ordinary fare, but can be obtained from the College cellar at fixed prices.\n\n23. A chapel is attached to College, which the students residing in the College are expected to attend, unless specially exempted.\n\n24. Every student will be required to go through a course of gymnastics and also of military exercises, including the use of the rifle.\n\n25. Students are required to wear academical dress, under such regulations as may be prescribed from time to time.\n\nStudents not nominated for the Indian Forest Service, but desirous of obtaining a Diploma in Forestry from Coopers Hill College.\n\n26. Students not nominated for the Indian Forest Service may be received into the College, as far as the available accommodation permits. Such students may pass through the course of instruction prescribed for the nominees of the Indian Forest Service, as detailed above, or they may be permitted to participate in the instruction given in certain subjects only. On attaining the prescribed minima of marks in the several branches of study and in totals as laid down above, they will receive, as the case may require, either the College Diploma in Forestry or special certificates showing in what subjects they have followed the instruction, and with what result.\n\n27. Candidates who desire to be admitted under paragraph 26 may submit the necessary application at any time, but not later than the 15th day of June of the year named for admission, except with the special permission of the President. The application must be made on the prescribed forms, which can be obtained from the Secretary of the College.\n\n28. Candidates whose applications are found satisfactory as to character and in other respects will be required to undergo an examination, to be held at the College, about the last week in June of the year for admission. The object of the examination will be to ascertain whether the candidate is qualified to follow the course of instruction with advantage (or certain parts of it as the case may be). Candidates who do not come up to the required standard will not be admitted to the College. The President may dispense with the whole or any portion of this examination in the case of a candidate who produces an University diploma or other similar certificate granted by a recognized examining body.\n\n29. Candidates admitted to the College under paragraph 26, who propose to pass through the full prescribed course of study, will be required to pay the same fees in every respect as those paid by the nominees for the India Forest Service. Candidates who do not become resident, and are admitted only to certain subjects of study, will be required to pay the fees which may be fixed in each special case in consideration of the extent of their studies. The candidates of both classes will be required to abide by the general rules of the College.\n\n* For details see Royal Indian Engineering College Calendar.\nREGULATIONS FOR ADMISSION TO THE FOREST SERVICE.\n\nFOREST EXAMINATION.\n\nSYLLABUS,\n\nSHOWING THE EXTENT AND CHARACTER OF THE FOREST EXAMINATION FROM AND AFTER JUNE, 1892.\n\nIn a letter addressed to the Civil Service Commissioners on the subject of the examinations for admission into the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, the Director-General of military education observes\u2014\u201cThe main object to be borne in mind with reference to the Entrance Examination is to secure a youth who has had a thoroughly well-grounded liberal education as an English gentleman. Any curriculum which renders those who are unsuccessful unfit for other professions is greatly to be deprecated.\u201d The Regulations for the Forest Examination, which follow the lines of the Woolwich Examination, are intended to provide a test that the Candidates have received such an education as is indicated in these words. By these Regulations certain of the subjects specified are prescribed as obligatory for all competitors, while, in the choice of the subjects described as optional, allowance is made for varieties of taste and inclination in each Candidate. In view of the influence which the Regulations must necessarily exercise on the education of Candidates for admission to the public service, the Civil Service Commissioners deem it expedient to specify, with more fullness than in the Regulations themselves, the character of the Examination which, in June 1892 and afterwards the Candidates will be called upon to undergo.\n\nCLASS I.\u2014OBLIGATORY SUBJECTS.\n\nMathematics.\u2014The extent of the Examination will be as defined in the Regulations.\n\nEnglish Composition.\u2014An Essay to be written on one of several subjects specified by the Civil Service Commissioners on their Examination Paper.\n\nGerman.\u2014There will be translations of unseen passages from German into English, and from English into German; the knowledge of pronunciation will be tested by Dictation and the oral examination. The passages for translation will be taken mainly, from standard authors (Schiller, Lessing, Alexander v. Humboldt, Ranke, &c.), and a few simple questions may be asked on the passages set, as to the structure and character of the language, and allusions of obvious and general interest.\n\nCLASS II.\u2014OPTIONAL SUBJECTS.\n\nHigher Mathematics.\u2014The extent of the Examination will be as defined in the Regulations.\n\nLatin.\u2014Passages will be set for translation into English selected from the authors usually read in schools. Passages from English authors will be given for translation into Latin prose and verse, but Candidates will be allowed, in the place of verse composition, to answer questions of a simple character, which will test whether they possess a fundamental knowledge of the grammar of the language, and such an elementary acquaintance with Roman History as is required for the intelligent study of the books they have read.\n\nGreek.\u2014Passages will be set for translation into English from the authors usually read in schools, and in other respects the Examination will proceed on the same lines as in Latin.\n\nFrench.\u2014The passages for translation will be taken from standard authors (Corneille, Madame de S\u00e9vign\u00e9, Guizot, Taine, &c.), and in other respects the Examination will proceed on the same lines as in German.\n\nEnglish History.\u2014The General Paper in this subject will test whether the Candidates are accurately acquainted with the facts of English History, and also possess an intelligent knowledge of the meaning of the facts. The paper on the fixed period will, of course, require from the Candidates more minute knowledge than the General Paper.\n\nBotany, Chemistry, Physics, Physical Geography and Geology.\u2014The standard of Examination in these subjects will be such as may be reasonably expected from the education given at schools possessing appliances for practical instruction, such as a laboratory, &c. A considerable portion of the marks will be allotted for the proficiency shown in the practical part of the Examination.\n\nGENERAL.\n\nHandwriting.\u2014In estimating the papers of candidates, a limited number of marks, namely 100 out of the maximum allotted to each subject, are held to be assignable for handwriting.\n\nABSTRACT OF THE FIRST EDITION OF THE CIVIL SERVICE REGULATIONS.\n\n[Want of space has rendered it necessary to omit many rules which, it should be understood, are of equal force with those here printed. A complete copy of the Civil Service Regulations can be seen on personal application at the Record Department of the India Office.]\n\nPART I.\u2014PRELIMINARY.\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\nGENERAL SCOPE.\n\n1. No standing order not contained in these regulations should be quoted or trusted in deciding, or submitting for orders, any question affecting the Pay and Allowances, Leave, Pension, or Travelling Allowances of Officers the conditions of whose service are not defined by the Army and Marine Regulations. If any Officer thinks that any order not embodied in these regulations ought to be revived, he should refer the question, through the proper channel, to the Government of India. Without the special authority of the Government of India, no such order is valid.\n\n6. (a) The Government of India reserves to itself the right of modifying the Leave rules in these regulations as may from time to time seem to it expedient, and of interpreting them in case of dispute.\n\n(b) In all contracts for service in India to which the Secretary of State is a party, provision is made for the exercise by the Government of these rights.\n\n(c) An officer\u2019s claim to leave is regulated by the rules in force at the time that the leave is applied for and granted.\n\n7. (a) The Government also reserves to itself the right of changing the Pension Rules from time to time at its discretion, and of interpreting their meaning. An officer\u2019s claim to pension is governed by the rules in force at the time when he resigns or is discharged from the service of Government: he is not entitled to concessions withdrawn before, or made after, his resignation or discharge.\n\n(b) The general purport of this rule is inserted by the Secretary of State in all Covenants for Service in India, to which conditions relating to Pension are attached.\n\n(c) In accordance with the principle laid down in clause (a) the claims of persons who have already left the service of Government must be determined by the rules which were in force at the time they left it. These regulations do not necessarily apply to them.\n\nNOTE.\u2014The following extract from a Resolution of the Government of India No. 4863, dated 4th December 1891, relates to the exercise of the right reserved in Articles\nto 7 to alter the leave and pension rules from time to me:\n\n\"Her Majesty's Secretary of State for India, having examined the particular instances which were mentioned in support of the complaints referred to in clause (c) of paragraph 1 of his resolution, regarding the manner in which the right to alter the leave and pension rules had been exercised by the Government of India, expressed the opinion that in none of them had there been any interference with the rights of the servants of the Government. The Government of India have always been careful to exercise the right of altering rules with due consideration for the rights of their servants. The ordinary course adopted to prevent hardship arising from any change of rule found necessary has been either to defer the introduction of the change for some time after its publication, or to give the officers affected the right of choosing whether they shall come under the operation of the old or of the new rules. It has been decided that the right of altering rules must be maintained, that care should be taken, as in the past, to prevent the introduction of any new rules from operating harshly, but that the Local Governments and the Government of India should not consider themselves precluded from recommending an exception in any case of individual hardship which may arise in spite of the precautions taken. If any case of apparent hardship arises, the local authorities should understand that, when the officer applies to retire, they are not precluded from examining into its merits and ascertaining whether, in their opinion, he has substantially suffered from the introduction of a rule not in force at the time he entered the service. If, after comparing the advantages secured to the officer by the alteration with any disadvantages incidentally involved, they find that he has on the whole substantially suffered, the point may be taken into consideration in determining whether some compensation ought not to be granted in the particular instance.\"\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nDEFINITIONS.\n\n8. Unless there be something repugnant in the subject or context, the terms defined in this chapter are used in the Regulations in the sense here explained. When these terms are, in the Regulations, printed in italics, it is meant that the rule cannot be fully applied without reference to the definition.\n\n9.

Native of India means any person born and domiciled within the dominions of Her Majesty in India, or within the territories of Indian Princes tributary to, or in alliance with, Her Majesty, of parents habitually resident in India, and not established there for temporary purposes only.\n\n46. Officer.\u2014In the Leave Rules \"An Officer\" means an officer of any class to whom Leave of Absence from duty may be granted under these regulations, and does not therefore include \"a Military Officer subject to the Military Leave Rules.\"\n\n47. Pay and Salary.\u2014\n(a) \"Pay\" means \"Monthly Substantive Pay.\"\n(b) For the purposes of the European Service Leave Rules in Part III, \"Pay\" includes also the Subsistence Allowance of a Covenanted Civil Servant, or a Military Officer subject to the Civil Leave Rules who has an officiating, but not a substantive appointment. (But see Rule 2 under Article 42.)\n(c) \"Salary\" means the sum of Pay and Acting Allowance or Charge Allowance under Chapter VIII.\n\n1. Personal Allowance is treated, for the purposes of calculating Leave Allowances, and Pensions, as part of an Officer's Substantive Pay.\n\n2. If an Officer whose whole time is retained for the public service is appointed to hold conjointly with any other Government office, a Minor Professorship under the Medical Warrant of April, 1867, or a Professorship or Lecturership in any Government Institution, the allowances received by him in such appointment are part of his salary.\n\n3. \"Salary\" does not include House-rent, Tentage, or Travelling Allowances\u2014whether daily, monthly, or yearly; nor does it include a Local Allowance.\n\nThe charge allowance admissible to Permanent Telegraph Masters under Public Works Department Resolution No. 125 T.E., dated the 7th August, 1889, is included in salary for the purpose of calculating the leave allowances of such officers.\n\nNote.\u2014[These definitions do not necessarily apply to the Statutory Rules under articles 600, 632, &c.]\n\n48. The \"Pay of an Appointment\" means the pay which any particular Officer would receive monthly if he held the appointment substantively.\n\n49 (a) The \"Pay of an Officer\" is, in the case of an Officer with a substantive appointment, the amount which he would receive, monthly, under any of the following designations, in his substantive appointment:\u2014\n\nSubstantive Pay.\nConsolidated Pay.\nMilitary Pay and Allowances and Staff Salary\nStaff Corps Pay and Staff Salary.\n\n(b) In the case of an Officer without a substantive appointment\u2014his monthly Subsistence Allowance (if a Covenanted Civil Servant or a Military Officer subject to the Civil Leave Rules); and his Military Pay and Allowances or Staff Corps Pay (if a Military Officer subject to the Military Leave Rules).\n\n50. Pension.\u2014Except when the term \"Pension\" is used in contradistinction to \"Gratuity,\" \"Pension\" includes \"Gratuity.\"\n\n51. Pensionable Office or Pensionable Service.\u2014Service is said to be \"Pensionable\" when it qualifies; and an Office is said to be \"Pensionable\" when service therein counts.\n\n53. Progressive Appointment means an appointment the pay of which is progressive, and Progressive Pay is pay which, subject to the good behaviour of an officer, rises, by periodical increments, from a minimum to a maximum.\n\nNote.\u2014For brevity's sake, a Progressive Pay is described by three groups of figures, namely: the minimum, the increment, and the maximum.\n\nExample.\u2014A pay of Rs. 100-20-200 means a pay rising from Rs. 100 by a yearly increment of Rs. 20 to Rs. 200.\n\n55. Qualify.\u2014\"Qualify\" and \"Count\" mean qualify and count for Pension from the General Revenues or Leave of Absence, as the case may be.\n\n57. Salary.\u2014See \"Pay and Salary,\" Article 47.\n\n58. Staff Salary is an allowance to a Military Officer in addition to the Military Pay and Allowances or the Staff Corps Pay of his rank.\n\n59. Warrant Officer.\u2014\n(a) \"A Warrant Officer\" includes every Warrant Officer, to whichever Military Furlough Rules he may be subject, and whether he hold an Honorary or Veteran Commission or not.\n(b) The grades of Warrant Officers are\u2014\n\n| Grade       | Description                          |\n|-------------|--------------------------------------|\n| 1st class   | Deputy Commissary                    |\n|             | Assistant Commissary                 |\n|             | Deputy Assistant Commissary          |\n| 2nd class   | Conductor                            |\n|             | Sub-Conductor                        |\n\nOf the Subordinate Medical Department, Senior Apothecaries rank as 1st class Warrant Officers (Army Regulations, Vol. I., Articles 852 and 853).\n\nPART II.\u2014RULES REGARDING PAY AND ALLOWANCES.\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nGENERAL RULES.\n\n63. A person whose age exceeds twenty-five years may not ordinarily be admitted into the Service of the State.\n\n64. Unless it be otherwise provided by special rule or contract, the salary of an officer begins when he takes charge of the appointment in respect of which it is earned.\n\n65. Subject to the provisions of the Subsidiary leave rules in Chapter XIII, Articles 352 to 365, the first day of an Officer's leave is the first day on which he has not charge of his office after noon, and the last day of his leave is the last day on which he has not charge before noon.\n\n66. An Officer may leave India, or return to India, by any port; but his Furlough or Special leave begins on, and includes, the day of the vessel's departure from the port where he first meets it, and ends on the day before its arrival at the port where he last quits it.\n\nExample.\u2014The Furlough or Special Leave of an Officer sailing from Calcutta in a vessel which touches at Madras, begins on the departure of the vessel from Calcutta, and not from Madras.\n78. Promotion during Leave.\u2014If an Officer while absent on \"short leave\" during which the amount of his leave allowances depends upon the substantive or officiating rank or appointment which he would hold if present on duty, obtains promotion substantive or officiating, the increased of pay or acting allowance which involves no change in, or addition to, his duties or responsibilities, the promotion or increase has effect at once. Otherwise, the promotion of an absent Officer has effect only from the date of his return to duty.\n\n81. Advances and their Recovery.\u2014The following rules regulate the grant of advances to officers on arrival in India on first appointment to the service of the Government of India and to Officers returning from leave or special duty out of India:\n\n(a) An advance of pay for the month in which the Officer arrives in India, and for the ensuing month, up to a maximum of 1,000 rupees, may be made to any public Officer in the Civil Department on arrival in India on first appointment or on return from long leave or special duty out of India.\n\n(b) The advance may be drawn under the orders of the Audit Officer from any treasury in India to be specified in such orders.\n\n(c) Such advances, as well as similar advances issued by the Home Government, are to be recovered by monthly instalments of one-third of salary.\n\nNote.\u2014[Clause (c) does not apply to Covenanted Engine-drivers, Mechanics, Boiler-makers, &c., recoveries from whom are regulated by Article 735 in Chapter XXXI. (State Railway Revenue Establishments.)]\n\n(d) This Article also applies to the case of Military Officers obtaining advances under the Military Furlough Rules of 1868.\n\n81a. A Civil officer returning from furlough out of India is not granted an advance of allowance for more than thirty-five days beyond the date of embarkation for India.\n\n82. If an officer receives an advance of pay in England to enable him to return to duty in India, the advance will be recovered at the rate or rates of exchange fixed for the adjustment of financial transactions between the Imperial and Indian Governments for the year in which the advance was made. This rule will also apply when an advance is made in England to a person appointed there, proceeding to India to join his appointment.\n\n83. Transfer on Duty.\u2014(a) No officer (unless he has been newly appointed to the service of Government) can begin to draw any pay or allowances at any treasury in India, or at the Home treasury of the Government of India, without producing a last-pay certificate from the treasury where his pay or allowances were last disbursed, or from the Accountant-General within whose jurisdiction this treasury is.\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nDEPUTATIONS TO EUROPE.\n\n102. A Military Officer in military employ, who is permitted to proceed to Europe for the purpose of acquiring professional information, or is deputed on special duty to Europe, receives during the period of his absence from India the full Indian pay and allowances of his rank and half Staff Salary.\n\n103. A Civil Officer, or a Military Officer in civil employ, who, with the sanction of the Secretary of State, is deputed to Europe on special civil duty, is entitled, from the date on which he makes over charge of his office in India to the date on which he resumes it, to an allowance not exceeding two-thirds of the amount which he would draw were he on duty in India.\n\n104. A Civil Officer, or a Military Officer in civil employ, who, under the orders of the Secretary of State, is detained in Europe on civil duty, or permitted to remain on special civil duty, beyond the period of his leave, is entitled\u2014\n\n(i) If on any leave other than privilege leave\u2014to an allowance not exceeding two-thirds of his pay and allowances in India;\n\n(ii) If on privilege leave\u2014to an allowance not exceeding half his pay and allowances in India, for the period during which he is so detained or permitted to remain on special civil duty.\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\nACTING ALLOWANCES\u2014RULES FOR CALCULATION.\n\n127. An Officer without a substantive appointment is entitled to subsistence allowance with an acting allowance of half the pay of any appointment in which he officiates.\n\n1. The monthly subsistence allowance for a Covenanted Civil Servant or a Military Officer subject to the Civil Leave Rules is as follows:\n\n| Rs. |\n|-----|\n| To an officer of not more than eight years' actual residence in India | 250 |\n| To an officer of more than eight, but less than twelve years' actual residence in India | 320 |\n| To an officer of twelve or more years' actual residence in India | 400 |\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\nJOINING TIME.\n\n193. Joining Time is the time allowed to an Officer to proceed from one Station to another when his appointment is changed, or when, being unemployed, he is appointed to any office. An Officer is held to be on duty during Joining Time, if he is entitled to allowances.\n\n194. Only one day is allowed for joining an appointment which does not, necessarily, involve a change of residence.\n\n195. In cases involving a change of station Joining Time is calculated as follows, subject to a maximum of thirty days: Sundays not actually spent in travelling are not included in the calculation:\n\n(i) Six days for preparation; and, in addition, thereto,\n\nfor the portion of the journey which a day for the Officer travels, or might travel, each\nby Railway ... 200 miles\nby Ocean Steamer ... 150 \"\nby River Steamer ... 80 \"\nby Mail Cart or other public stage conveyance drawn by horses ... 80 \"\nin any other way ... 15 \"\n\nAn extra day is allowed for any fraction of distance over that prescribed.\n\n(ii) \u2014 When part of the journey is by steamer, the days intervening between the Officer being set free from his office, or, if he has no office, receiving his orders, and the departure of the steamer, or his start duly regulated to catch the steamer, shall be added.\n\n196. By whatever route the Officer travels, his Joining Time shall, unless the Local Government specially permit otherwise, be calculated by the route which travellers habitually use.\n\n205. Allowances. Except in the case mentioned in Article 208, an officer will draw, during Joining Time, the pay or salary which he drew in his old appointment or that which he will draw on joining his new appointment, whichever may be less; provided that an officer transferred from one officiating appointment to another shall not draw any acting allowance during Joining Time if he had not a superior lien on either of the officiating appointments to that of the officer relieved by or relieving him. If the officer is entitled to tentage in his old appointment and tentage is also attached to his new appointment, he may draw tentage during Joining Time at the lower of the two rates.\n\n209. An officer who does not join his new appointment within his Joining Time is entitled to no allowances after the end of his Joining Time, and after a week ceases to have a lien on any appointment. But if the Local Government considers that his default was due to circumstances beyond his control, it may exempt him from the loss of his appointment.\n\nNote. \u2014 [The expression \"allowances\" in this article does not include travelling allowances.]\n\nPART III.\u2014LEAVE RULES.\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\nGENERAL CONDITIONS OF LEAVE.\n\n219. Extent of Application. \u2014 The rules in this Chapter apply to all Officers in Civil Employ, except in so far as they are inconsistent with, or over-ridden by, the special conditions of leave which obtain in the case of the following classes of Officers:\n\n(a) Lieutenant-Governors and Members of Council (see Chapter XXII).\n\n(b) Judges of the High Courts (see Chapter XXIII).\n\n(c) Barristers holding the appointments of Judge of the Chief Court of the Punjab, First Judge of the Small Cause Courts of Presidency Towns, Recorder of Rangoon, or Secretary to the Government of India in the Legislative Department (see Chapter XXIV).\n\n(d) Statutory Native Civil Servants (see Chapter XXVI).\n\n(e) Ecclesiastical Officers (see Chapter XXVII).\n\n(f) Military Officers subject to the Military Leave Rules (see Chapter XXVIII and Appendices Nos. 11 and 12).\n\n(g) Law Officers (see Chapter XXX).\n\n(h) State Railway Establishments (see Chapter XXXI).\n\n(i) Bengal Covenanted Pilot Service (see Chapter XXXII).\n\n(j) Port Blair Police (see Chapter XXXIII).\n\n(k) Officers serving under Special Contracts. (Their contract.)\n\n1. An officer under contract is not entitled to leave, except in accordance with the terms of his contract. But if a Civil Engineer or other Officer belonging to one of the classes enumerated in Article 330, and appointed thereto by Her Majesty's Secretary of State, or with his particular sanction, or whose name is entered in Appendix No. 3, is, by the terms of his contract of service, entitled to leave under the \"Uncoventional Service Leave Rules,\" the Rules referred to shall be held to be the European Service Leave Rules prescribed in this part of these regulations.\n\nNote. \u2014 [If the health of an officer, who is serving under an agreement which does not give a title to leave until the expiry of a fixed period, fails during that period, his engagement should be terminated, unless\u2014\n\n(i) he has exhibited such special ability that it is desirable on public grounds to retain him even at the cost of the difference between a leave allowance and any passage-money, &c., due under his agreement; and\n\n(ii) it is certified that he will in all probability be able to return to duty at or before the end of six months,\n\nIn cases in which the engagement is not terminated, leave may be granted for a period not exceeding six months and on allowances not exceeding half pay.]\n\n220. Discretion of Government. (a) Leave of absence can never be claimed absolutely as of right. Nothing in these regulations must be understood to limit the free discretion of the Government to refuse, or revoke, leave of absence of any description, at any time, according to the exigencies of the Public Service.\n\n(b) The Local Government may refuse to grant the full amount of leave applied for in any case, and should, by the exercise of this power, so regulate the date of an officer's return from leave as to cause as little change as possible in administrative arrangements.\n\n222. Maximum Leave admissible. \u2014 After five years' continuous absence, whether with or without leave, an officer is considered to be out of Government employ.\n\nNote. \u2014 [This article does not apply to officers transferred to Foreign Service in India.]\n\n223. An officer recalled to duty before the expiry of leave of any kind is entitled to take the balance of his leave, together with any leave of the same kind subsequently earned, as soon as he can be spared from duty. Time occupied in the voyage to India on recall from recognised leave out of India counts as active service under Article 11 (iii).\n\n224. An officer recalled to duty before the expiry of any recognised leave out of India is entitled to free passage to India, besides travelling allowance from the port of embarkation in India to the Station to which he is posted. During the voyage to India leave allowances only are granted.\n\n225. An officer recalled to duty before the expiry of leave in India, other than Privilege leave, is treated as on duty (i.e., on joining time between appointments) from the date on which he starts for the Station to which he is ordered, and is entitled to his travelling allowances on his journey to the Station to which he is posted.\n\n226. An officer recalled to duty from Privilege leave is entitled to no concession except that mentioned in Article 223.\n\nSERVICE QUALIFYING FOR LEAVE.\n\n231. (a) Service in the Army, which, under Article 388, counts towards civil pension, qualifies also for leave. Any leave taken by an officer during such service will, in the calculation of future leave, be treated as if it had been taken under these regulations.\n(b) Otherwise save as provided in Articles 230, 275 and 276 these regulations do not apply to Military Officers or Soldiers, or to the Military Branch of the Subordinate Medical Service.\n\n232. Service before resignation.\u2014Save as provided for in Articles 233 and 234, an officer who is discharged from, or resigns, the Public Service, and is re-employed after an interval, cannot, without the sanction of the Government of India, count his service before discharge or resignation towards leave after re-employment.\n\n233. An officer discharged from the Indian Navy on its abolition, and subsequently re-employed, may count his Naval service towards leave after re-employment, notwithstanding the occurrence of a moderate interval between his discharge from the Indian Navy and his first re-employment. Any leave taken by such officer while in the Indian Navy will be treated, in calculating the leave due to him under these regulations, as if such leave had been taken under the rules to which he became subject on re-employment.\n\n235. Service as Private Secretary to the Governor-General, a Governor or a Lieutenant-Governor, qualifies for leave, provided that the officer (before his appointment as Private Secretary) belonged to the Civil Service (whether covenanted or not) or to the Staff Corps, or to any of the Indian Establishments of the Indian Army.\n\n238. Foreign Service; and Service under Local Funds. (a) The rules regarding the furlough allowance of officers lent to Foreign Service, (including service under Her Majesty's Government in England or under any Colonial or Foreign Government outside of India, and regarding privilege leave allowance of officers taking employment under the Egyptian Government, are contained in Part VII.\n\nLIEN ON APPOINTMENT.\n\n240. (a) Subject to his good conduct and efficiency, an officer under the European Service Leave Rules, on Ordinary Furlough, or on Special Leave, has a lien on his substantive Appointment, or on a substantive appointment of a like character and not less pay. He has no lien on an acting appointment.\n\n(b) On other Furlough, a Covenanted Civil Servant or a military officer subject to the Civil Leave Rules, has no lien; but a Civil Engineer or other officer subject to the European Service Rules has a lien. (See also Article 345.)\n\n241. An officer an \"long leave\" has no claim to substantive promotion; but there is no objection to such promotion. (See Article 76.)\n\n242. An officer on leave may not surrender his lien on his substantive appointment and, except on the ground of the officer's misbehaviour or inefficiency, a Local Government may not fill up substantively, even for a time only, an appointment on which an officer has a lien, without transferring the officer to another substantive appointment of not less pay. The saving which accrues to the State by paying acting, instead of substantive, allowances, must be carefully secured as a set-off against the cost of leave allowances.\n\n243. An officer cannot obtain Ordinary Furlough or retain allowances under Article 346 unless he has a substantive appointment. A Military officer who has no substantive civil appointment, and has not been in continuous civil employ for at least three years, continues subject to Military Rules, and can only get Military Furlough Allowances.\n\nCOMPULSORY RETIREMENT.\n\n244. If a Local Government considers it inexpedient that an officer should return from leave out of India, it should furnish a complete statement of the circumstance to the Secretary of State (in the case of the Government of Madras or Bombay, direct, or otherwise, through the Government of India), if possible, when the Furlough or Special Leave is granted, but, in any case, in time to enable the Secretary of State to take any measures that may seem to him necessary before the officer would, in ordinary course, be permitted to return to duty. The report to the Secretary of State should reach the India Office, at latest, three months before the end of the officer's leave.\n\nVACATING APPOINTMENT.\n\n249. No officer's appointment becomes vacant simply by reason of his taking leave under the Indian Service Leave Rules. But absence without leave, or after the end of leave (except in the case of the week's grace allowed by clause (ii) of Article 261 (a)), involves loss of appointment.\n\n250. The Secretary of State, in granting to officers extension of leave, sometimes declines to guarantee retention of appointment, if there is no time to communicate with the Local Government in India\n\nCOMMENCEMENT OF LEAVE.\n\n251. Ordinarily if an officer makes over charge of his office before noon, his leave in India begins on and includes the day on which he makes over charge; otherwise it begins on and includes the following day, but if the absence of the officer does not involve the immediate deputation of an officer from another station, or the formal transfer of charge by the way of sale or over money, or the like, then the absentee may leave his station at the close of the last day on which the office is open for business before his leave begins. In such case the several transfers of charge dependent upon the departure of the absentee shall take effect from the close of the last working day as aforesaid. But, subject to the provisions of Article 359, the leave of the absentee and the re-arrangement of allowances, if any, depending upon his departure, shall begin from, and include, the first day thereafter on which the office is open for business. The actual date of the officer's departure from his station must, however, always be reported.\n\nNote.\u2014For the purposes of this Article the office is regarded as closed for business only on Sundays and gazetted holidays.\n\n252. The rules regarding commencement of leave out of India will be found in Article 359.\n\n253. An officer taking Furlough or Special Leave out of India must report his embarkation, through the Audit Officer, to the Local Government (or other authority) which granted his leave, and his arrival in England to the Secretary of State.\n\nRETURN TO DUTY.\n\nNote.\u2014[Articles 256 to 262 apply to Military officers subject to the Military Leave Rules only in respect to leave of absence granted in the Civil Department.]\n\n256. An Officer may not, without the permission of the Authority which granted him leave, return to duty more than fourteen days before the end of Long Leave. This Rule applies to a Military Officer subject to the Military Leave Rules; but he must obtain permission to return to duty from the Local Government.\n\n257. An Officer on Long Leave in Europe may not return to India without obtaining the permission of the Secretary of State. He must apply for this permission at least three months before the end of his Leave. An Officer whose Long Leave was granted or has been extended on medical certificate is required to produce a certificate of fitness before he can be permitted to return to duty. Ordinarily, he must obtain this certificate from the Medical Board of the India Office, but, in special cases, particularly if the officer be residing at a distance of more than sixty miles from London, the Secretary of State will, at his discretion, accept a certificate from two medical practitioners in lieu thereof.\n\n258. An officer is not entitled, at the end of Long Leave out of India or Subsidiary Leave affixed thereto, to resume, as a matter of course, without further orders the particular appointment which he vacated before his Long Leave. He should report his return to duty in the manner prescribed in Article 260 and await orders.\n\n259. If the appointment of an officer is changed during Long Leave in India, he must join his new appointment\nCHAPTER XI.\u2014continued.\n\nwithin his leave. But the Local Government may allow him joining time if he have not had sufficient notice of the change.\n\n260. A gazetted officer must report his return to duty to the Local Government under which he is employed. A Bengal Covenanted Civil Servant employed directly under the Government of India, returning from Long Leave, must also report his return to the Government of India in the Home Department.\n\n261. (a) An Officer who remains absent after the end of his Leave is entitled to no allowance for the period of such absence, and ceases to have a lien on any appointment,\n\n(i) if his leave was Furlough under the European Service Leave Rules, or Furlough or Leave on Medical Certificate under the Indian Service Leave Rules,\u2014immediately; and\n\n(ii) if it was Special Leave under the European Service Leave Rules, Leave on private affairs under the Indian Service Rules, or Privilege Leave,\u2014after a week, unless, in the case of officers stationed in the Andaman and Nicobar, the overstay is authorised by clause (ii) of Article 282(a).\n\n(b) The provisions of this article have no effect on the liability of an officer overstaying leave in regard to the forfeiture of past service, the rule as to which is contained in Article 463 (b) in Part IV.\n\nEXTENSION AND COMMUTATION OF LEAVE.\n\n264. No kind of leave, except Extraordinary Leave without allowances under Articles 366 and 372, and in certain cases Examination Leave, can be granted in continuation of any other kind; but any leave granted under these regulations may be retrospectively charged for any other kind or period of leave for which the officer was qualified when the leave was originally granted; and the Local Government may commute retrospectively periods of absence without leave into leave without allowances (see Article 464 in Part IV.). Subsidiary Leave is not, for the purposes of this rule, regarded as a continuation of leave.\n\n265. The grant or Extension of Furlough, under Article 264 (otherwise than on medical certificate), is subject to Proviso (iv) under Article 340 (b).\n\n266. If an officer subject to the Indian Service Leave Rules who is absent on Privilege leave, or on Leave on private affairs, or on Furlough, takes an extension of leave on medical certificate, the whole of the absence will be treated as leave on medical certificate.\n\n267. Extraordinary leave without allowances under Article 366 cannot be converted retrospectively into leave on medical certificate; but leave on medical certificate may be given in continuation of Extraordinary Leave without allowances.\n\n268. (a) An officer absent on Long Leave in Europe or in any of the colonies in America or the West Indies, who wishes to have his leave extended or commuted, must apply to the Secretary of State about three months before the expiration of his leave and produce with his application evidence that the Local Government had been referred to by him, and that the Local Government had no objection to the extension or commutation desired.\n\n(b) This rule will be strictly enforced, and officers returning to India, at times other than those fixed for them by their own Government, must understand that they are liable to be kept on subsistence allowance until a suitable vacancy occurs to which to post them.\n\n(c) The Secretary of State, however, reserves to himself the power of granting extension or commutation of leave to an officer, in any case in which it appears to him that sufficient ground has been shown for the application being made, without the previous approval of the Local Government, but in the event of it being found necessary by the Secretary of State to communicate with the Government of India or the Government of Madras or Bombay by telegraph in regard to any such application, the cost of the telegrams to and from India will be charged to the applicant.\n\nNote.\u2014(This article applies to the placing of officers who are on leave out of India on special duty in extension of the leave.)\n\n(d) Furlough out of India on medical certificate may be commuted into leave without medical certificate if such leave was due at the time when the original furlough was granted, and if the officer seeking commutation is certified, in the manner prescribed in Article 257, to have recovered his health; when extension of the commuted furlough is applied for, the officer applying for such extension must produce the necessary evidence that the Local Government to which he is subordinate consents to the extension of his leave.\n\nApplications for extensions of commuted Furlough on medical certificate should be dealt with by Local Governments in such a way that officers who have preferential claims to furlough under Article 342 are not thereby debarred for a considerable time from availing themselves of the furlough at their credit.\n\n269. An officer on Long Leave in any of the colonies or dependencies named in appendix No. 17, except the colonies in America or the West Indies, who wishes to have his leave extended or commuted, must apply to the Local Government or other authority in India which granted the original leave, three months before the expiration of the leave.\n\n270. When Privilege leave is, on Medical certificate, retrospectively charged for Furlough out of India, so much of the leave passed before the departure of the vessel in which the officer sails may be treated as Subsidiary Leave under clause (i) of Article 352 (a) as might have been granted as Subsidiary Leave if the officer had originally obtained Furlough and not Privilege Leave, notwithstanding that a portion of such retrospective Furlough has been passed in India.\n\n271. In the case of a Military Officer subject to the Military Leave Rules, leave may be retrospectively commuted by the Authority which granted it to any other kind of leave which the said Authority would have been competent to allow when the original leave was sanctioned.\n\nNote.\u2014Articles 268 to 270 apply to Military Officers subject to the Military Leave Rules.\n\nCHAPTER XII.\n\nSHORT LEAVE.\n\n272. General Limitation.\u2014The rules in this chapter regulate the short leave of all officers in civil employ, (whatever may be the rules to which they are subject in regard to other leave), except\u2014\n\n(a) The Governor General, Governors, Lieutenant-Governors, and Members of Council (see Chapter XXII.).\n\n(b) Judges of the High Court (see Chapter XXIII.).\n\n(c) Barristers holding the appointments referred to in Chapter XXIV., except as stated in that chapter.\n\n(d) Ecclesiastical Officers except Articles 312 and 314 (see Chapter XXVII.).\n\n(e) Law Officers, except as stated in Chapter XXX.\n\n(f) State Railway Establishments, except as stated in Chapter XXXI.\n\n(g) Bengal Covenanted Pilots, except as stated in Chapter XXXII.\n\n(h) Port Blair Police (see Chapter XXXIII.).\n1. Military Officers and Subordinates of the Army employed in the Military Works Department are subject to these regulations as regards privilege leave, but as regards leave generally are treated as in Military employ.\n\nPrivilege Leave.\n\n277. The amount of Privilege Leave earned by an Officer is one-eleventh part of the time during which he has been on duty without interruption: Provided that no Privilege Leave can be earned by an Officer by duty performed, while three months' such leave is due to him, and that, whenever duty is interrupted, all claims to Privilege Leave earned theretofore is forfeited. Absence on Privilege Leave, though not counting as duty, is not an interruption of duty within the meaning of this Article.\n\n278. The calculation must be made as follows:\u2014One calendar month for every eleven complete calendar months of duty, and one day for every eleven days of the balance.\n\n282. Limit.\u2014The amount of Privilege Leave admissible at one time is by the above rules limited to three calendar months; but in the following cases, an exception to this general rule is allowed:\n\n(a) Officers stationed in the Andamans and Nicobars are allowed, on each occasion when they may wish to take Privilege Leave, the option between the following two courses, namely:\u2014\n\n(i) To accumulate Privilege leave up to three months and fifteen days.\n\n(ii) To overstay any Privilege leave due by fifteen days without forfeiting pay or appointment, provided that, in the case of such overstay, the officer shall not begin to count service towards future Privilege leave until he shall have served a period of time proportionate to the amount of overstay\u2014that is, eleven times the period of overstay.\n\n233. The Privilege Leave due to an officer is the Privilege Leave which he has earned since the last interruption of duty, less the period during which he has been absent on Privilege Leave.\n\n291. Condition of Grant.\u2014To an Officer who has been on duty, without interruption, for eleven calendar months, and who has not, for six calendar months, been absent on Privilege Leave, the whole or any part of the Privilege Leave due to him may be granted.\n\n292. Lien on Appointment.\u2014An Officer on Privilege Leave has a lien on his substantive appointment; he has also a lien on his officiating appointment, so long as it is not resumed by an Officer having a superior lien on it.\n\n293. Leave Allowances.\u2014Except as provided in Articles 294, 306 (b), and 310, an Officer on Privilege Leave is entitled to a Leave Allowance equal to the salary which he would receive if he were on duty in the appointment on which he has a lien, and he is entitled to this allowance even though another officer be appointed to act for him.\n\n294. No extra expense may be imposed on the State in respect to the Privilege Leave of an officer whose pay is less than 100 rupees, and who is allowed Privilege Leave for more than one month at a time.\n\n295. An officer who has no lien on an appointment is entitled, during privilege leave\u2014\n\n(i) In the case of a Covenanted Civil Servant, or a Military Officer subject to the Civil Leave Rules\u2014to Subsistence Allowance.\n\n(ii) In the case of any other Civil Officer to no allowance.\n\n296. The right to receive Privilege leave allowances is contingent (except in the case of death) on the return of an officer to duty upon the expiry of such leave, whatever be the branch of the service to which an officer belongs.\n\n297. A non-gazetted officer whose salary is less than 200 rupees a month is not entitled to receive his allowances for the period of his leave till he returns to duty; he may, however, with the special sanction of the head of his office, receive in advance the allowances which would, but for this rule, become payable to him on the first and second pay days included within the period of his leave. Such advances will be drawn from the Treasury as final establishment charges.\n\nPrivilege Leave in cases of Regular Vacations.\n\n306. (a) Privilege Leave is not admissible to District and Sessions Judges who are permitted to avail themselves of the periodical court vacations, or to Officers serving in Departments in which regular vacations are allowed, during which the officers are permitted to be absent from duty, as Judicial Officers, Educational Officers, Officers in a High Court.\n\n(b) But in case of urgent necessity, Privilege Leave may be granted to any such officer under the ordinary Rules, subject to the conditions\u2014\n\n(i) That the officer shall during his absence receive only half the salary and allowances ordinarily admissible during Privilege Leave, and\n\n(ii) That the leave cannot in any case be combined with vacation.\n\n307. The preceding Article does not apply to the case of an officer who, by general or special orders issued by competent authority, prevented in any year from availing himself of the vacation or vacations by reason of his having to remain at his post on duty. In such a case Privilege Leave may be granted under the ordinary Rules; provided always that the leave shall not in any case be combined with vacation.\n\nNote.\u2014In the case of every officer to whom Articles 306 and 307 apply, the presumption is that he will avail himself of the vacation. No certificate of title to privilege leave, except the leave \"in case of urgent necessity\" under Article 306 (b), can be given for the period of service rendered between two vacations, until the second vacation expires. If, however, the conditions required by this Article or by Article 308 to render an officer eligible for privilege leave under the ordinary rules are subsequently fulfilled in respect of the second vacation, any privilege leave which may have been granted on half-salary under Article 306 (b), in consequence of the presumption that the officer would avail himself of the vacation, may be commuted into privilege leave on full salary. Privilege leave on full salary may be combined with privilege leave on half salary to the extent due, granted under Article 306 (b).\n\n309. An officer who is, by general or special orders issued by competent authority, prevented from availing himself of a part only of a periodical vacation may, during Privilege Leave subsequently taken, draw his full salary for a period bearing the same proportion, if the vacation be annual, to a month, or if it be half-yearly, to half a month, as the time spent on duty during the vacation bears to the whole vacation.\n\n310. An officer transferred from a department to which the ordinary privilege leave rules apply, to one in which Articles 306 to 309 apply, loses all claim to take the privilege leave at his credit, provided that\u2014\n\n(i.) Any privilege leave granted to him during the first three years after his transfer, under Article 306 and 309, may, to the extent of the privilege leave at his credit as aforesaid, be leave on full salary not exceeding the salary which would have been admissible if he had taken the leave immediately before being transferred.\n\n(ii.) If he returns to a department in which privilege leave is regulated by the ordinary rules, he shall be reckoned on such return to have at his credit the amount of leave which was at his credit at the time of the first transfer, less any amount enjoyed under proviso (i).\n\n311. The reckoning under the preceding article shall not, in any case, extend backwards over an interruption of duty.\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\nLONG LEAVE\u2014EUROPEAN SERVICES.\n\nGENERAL.\n\n330.

It may be explained that the conditions precedent to the entry of the name of an officer in Appendix No. 3 were that\u2014\n\n(i) He was not of purely Asiatic descent;\n\n(ii) He held substantively, on the 3rd January, 1872, one of the offices described in Article 330;\n\nand\n\n(iii) His salary, on the 10th February, 1873, was net less than six thousand rupees a year.\n\nFURLough.\n\n334. General Limitation.\u2014The amount of Furlough admissible to a Covenanted Civil Servant, or a Military Officer subject to the Civil Leave Rules, and the aggregate amount of Furlough and of Special Leave with Allowances, admissible to any other Officer to whom these rules apply (see Article 330), is six years. All the Rules in this part of the regulations are subject to this limitation.\n\n335. The following leave under other Rules is counted as Furlough under the preceding Article:\u2014\n\n(a) In the case of a Covenanted Civil Servant:\u2014Furlough and Leave with Allowances on Medical Certificate under former Rules.\n\n(b) In the case of a Military Officer subject to the Civil Leave Rules:\u2014Furlough under Rules 1 and 6 of the Military Furlough and Leave Rules of 1875.\n\n(c) In the case of any other officer to whom these Rules apply:\u2014Furlough and Leave with Allowances on Medical Certificate, and Leave on private affairs under former Rules, or under the Indian Service Leave Rules.\n\n336. Leave after completion of term of Service.\u2014(a) The limitations affecting Covenanted Civil Servants, whose term of service is complete, are prescribed in Article 614, and those affecting Military Officers, in Article 689.\n\n(b) A Civil Engineer or other officer subject to the Rules of this Chapter may, after he attains the age of fifty-five years, be granted Privilege leave, or any Special leave (Article 348) to which he may be otherwise entitled, or Extraordinary leave without allowances under Article 366. The total leave granted, under the heads of Special or Extraordinary, must not exceed six months in all. To such an officer no other kind of leave may be granted, and any leave, other than Privilege leave or Special leave, granted to such an officer before the date on which he attains the age fifty-five years, ceases to have effect on that date.\n\n337. The Amount of Furlough \"earned\" by an officer is one-fourth of his Active Service.\n\n338. (a) Provided that, in making this calculation for an Officer promoted to the \"Indian Services,\" only half of the Active Service rendered by him in offices other than those included in Article 330 shall be taken into account.\n\n1. The whole of the Active Service rendered by the Officer while officiating in any of the offices included in Article 330 is to be taken into account.\n\nNote.\u2014When a Military Officer becomes subject to the Civil Leave Rules, the Military Department will, on application and on being furnished with the date of commencement of Active Service, furnish to the Audit Officer, to whose audit such officer becomes subject, a memorandum showing the furlough earned, the different kinds of leave taken (distinguishing those which should be deducted from the maximum furlough permissible), and the balance of furlough due to him under Military Rules.\n\n338. (b.) Provided also that a Military Officer subject to Civil Rules may, if he desires it, prefix to furlough earned under Civil Rules an amount of furlough in respect of his Military service, calculated as follows:\u2014\n\n(i) An officer who, at the time of coming under Civil Leave Rules, was subject to the Military Furlough Regulations of 1868 or 1875, may be credited with the furlough that may have accrued...\nto him, less any furlough already taken which, under those rules, would reduce the amount of furlough due. The amount of furlough accrued shall, in that case, be calculated proportionally on the whole service qualifying for furlough, without reference to the minimum periods of service which those rules require to be rendered before furlough can be granted.\n\n(ii) The service for furlough of an officer who, at the time of coming under the Civil Leave Rules, was subject to the Leave Rules for the Staff Corps (1886), shall be calculated in accordance with Article 337 retrospectively from the date of his arrival in India; i.e., he shall be credited with an amount of furlough equivalent to one-fourth of his active service, less any leave out of India actually taken.\n\nNOTE.\u2014When a Military Officer becomes subject to the Civil Leave Rules, the Military Department will, on application and on being furnished with the date of commencement of Active Service, furnish to the Audit Officer, to whose audit such officer becomes subject, a memorandum showing the furlough earned, the different kinds of leave taken (distinguishing those which should be deducted from the maximum furlough permissible), and the balance or furlough due to him under Military Rules.\n\n339. The Amount of Furlough \"due\" to an Officer is the amount which he has \"earned,\" diminished:\n\nIn the case of a Covenanted Civil Servant:\n\n(i) By the Furlough which he has enjoyed under these or any former Rules, except Junior Furlough under the Rules in force before the 8th June 1855;\n\n(ii) By the excess over one year in the amount of leave with allowances, on medical certificate which he has enjoyed under former Rules.\n\n(b) In the case of a Military Officer subject to the Civil Leave Rules, by the Furlough which he has enjoyed under these regulations. (See also Note to Article 338 (b)).\n\n(c) In the case of an Officer other than an Officer of the Covenanted Civil Service or the Army\u2014\n\n(i) By the Furlough, or Special leave, with allowances, which he has enjoyed under these or any other Rules;\n\n(ii) By the leave on private affairs or on medical certificates with allowances, which he has enjoyed under the Rules formerly applicable to him.\n\nProvided that if more than two years' Furlough be due to an Officer when he first becomes subject to the Rules in this Chapter, the excess shall be cancelled.\n\n340. Furlough Admissible.\u2014To an Officer who has rendered three years' Continuous Service, Furlough for not more than two years may be granted, as follows:\n\n(a) On medical certificate,\u2014unconditionally; see Articles 895 to 902;\n\n(b) Without medical certificate,\u2014subject to these provisions:\n\n(i) That the Furlough be due to him;\n\n(ii) That he has rendered eight years' Active Service in Civil employ;\n\n(iii) If a Military Officer subject to the Civil Leave Rules, who has not rendered eight years' Active Service in Civil employ, and\n\n(1) If the Furlough which he applies for is his first Furlough\u2014that he has two years' Furlough due to him under the calculation in Article 338 (b); or\n\n(2) If the Furlough applied for be other than his first Furlough\u2014that he has rendered three years' Continuous Service since his return from Furlough;\n\n(iv) That the whole number of Officers absent one Furlough and Special leave do not exceed the limit (if any) appointed by the Government of India (see Articles 341 and 342).\n\n341. Except on medical certificate, or on very urgent private affairs, Furlough or Special Leave may not be granted to any Covenanted Civil Servant, or to any Military Officer whether subject to the Civil or the Military Leave Rules, or to any other Officer who is, if employed in Oudh, the Central Provinces, Burma, Assam, Ajmir, Coorg, or Berar, a Member of the Commission, or who is, if employed elsewhere, the holder of an office corresponding to that of a Member of a Commission; if one-fifth of all the Officers of a Commission, or of all Officers holding appointments similar to those of Members of a Commission, as the case may be, are already absent on Furlough or Special Leave.\n\n342. (a) If, under the operation of proviso (iv), Article 340, the applications for Furlough (including those under Article 264) cannot all be complied with, Furlough will be granted in the following order:\n\nFirst.\u2014To the applicant to whom most Furlough is due;\n\nSecondly.\u2014Of two or more applicants to whom the same amount is due; to him who has rendered longest Continuous Active Service;\n\nThirdly.\u2014Of two or more such applicants who have rendered the same Continuous Active Service\u2014to the Senior.\n\n(b) This article refers to applications registered for a Furlough not yet vacant. The order of date in which such applications are made has no significance. The article cannot affect applications made for a Furlough already vacant unless they happen to arrive by the same post.\n\n343. To an Officer who has not rendered three years' Continuous Service, Furlough for not more than one year may be granted on medical certificate.\n\n344. Extension of Furlough.\u2014(a) Furlough granted under Article 340 may, on medical certificate, be extended to not more than three years.\n\n(b) Furlough granted under Article 343 for less than one year may, on medical certificate, be extended to not more than one year.\n\n345. Ordinary Furlough can, under no circumstances, extend beyond two years at one time; it includes:\n\n(i) The first two years of each separate period of Furlough under Article 340, including any extension under Article 344 (a);\n\n(ii) So much of Furlough under Article 343, including any extension under Article 344 (b), as may be due: Provided that the Officer has rendered six months' Continuous Active Service.\n\n346. Leave Allowances.\u2014An officer on ordinary Furlough is entitled to a leave allowance equal to half his average salary subject to the following limits:\n\n(a) In the case of a Covenanted Civil Servant\u2014\n\n(i) If paid at the Home Treasury of the Government of India, maximum \u00a3250 a quarter, and minimum \u00a3125 a quarter, or his last salary, whichever is less;\n\n(ii) If paid in India, maximum Rs. 833\u00bd a month, and minimum Rs. 416\u00bd a month, or his last salary, whichever is less;\n\n(b) In the case of a Military Officer subject to the Civil Leave Rules the same maxima and minima as in the case of a Covenanted Civil Servant. Provided that, during Furlough prefixed under Article 338 (b) to the Furlough earned under Civil Rules, the minimum shall (in the case of an officer who entered civil employ on or after the 1st April, 1888) be that prescribed by the Military Rules to which the Officer was previously subject;\n\n(c) In the case of any other Officer subject to these Rules\u2014\n\nIf on furlough other than furlough on medical certificate out of India.\n\nMAXIMA.\n\nIf paid at the Home Treasury of the Government of India, \u00a3200 a quarter; no minimum.\n\nIf paid in India, Rs. 666\u00bd a month; no minimum.\n\nIf on furlough on medical certificate out of India.\n\nMAXIMA.\n\nIf paid at the Home Treasury of the Government of India, \u00a3200 a quarter.\n\nIf paid in India, Rs. 666\u00bd a month.\n\nMINIMA.\n\nIf paid at the Home Treasury of the Government of India, \u00a3200 a year, or three-fourths of last salary, whichever is less.\nIf paid in India, Rs. 166\u00bd a month, or three-fourths of last salary, whichever is less.\n\n347. An officer on Furlough other than Ordinary is entitled\u2014\n\nNote.\u2014Absentee allowances in respect of leave spent out of India will, if paid in India, be subject to the Rupee limits prescribed in this Article.\n\n(i) If a Covenanted Civil Servant, or a Military Officer subject to the Civil Leave Rules, to Subsistence Allowance;\n\n(ii) If an Officer not in the Indian Civil Service or in the Army, to \u00a3120 a quarter paid at the Home Treasury, or Rs. 400 a month paid in India, or to one quarter of his average salary whichever is less. When the furlough is on medical certificate out of India, the following minima shall apply instead of one-quarter salary:\n\nMinima.\n\nIf paid at the Home Treasury of the Government of India, \u00a3100 a year, or 37\u00bd per cent. of his last salary, whichever is less.\n\nIf paid in India, Rs. 83\u00bd a month, or 37\u00bd per cent of his last salary, whichever is less.\n\nSPECIAL LEAVE.\n\n348. Special leave on urgent private affairs may be granted at any time for not more than six months; provided that an Officer who has had Special leave must render six years' Active Service before he can again have such Leave.\n\n(1) The corresponding Leave under the Covenanted Civil Service Leave Rules in force before the 1st July, 1868, and furlough under Rules XI. of the Military Furlough Rules of 1868, are \"Special Leave\" within the meaning of this proviso.\n\nNote.\u2014[A question having been raised in 1887 as to whether a Military Officer in Civil employ who is under Military Leave Rules of 1868, can take ordinary Furlough three years after return from his last Furlough, notwithstanding that he has during the three years' interval taken six months' Special leave under the Civil Leave Rules as allowed by Article 671 of these Regulations, the following rulings were made:\n\n(i) The period of three years required for Furlough is not broken by Special leave intervening; but\n\n(ii) The Special leave does not count as part of the three years;\n\n(iii) Special leave is not included when counting the maximum eight years allowed for Furlough;\n\n(iv) Special leave does not count as service for Furlough.]\n\n349. An Officer promoted from an office subject to the Indian Service Rules is not debarred from obtaining Special leave with allowances under the preceding Article by reason of his having had Leave on Private Affairs under the Indian Service Leave Rules which is Furlough in another form.\n\n350. (a) For the first six months for which an officer is on Special leave, whether the six months be included in the same leave or not, he is entitled to the leave allowance admissible under Article 346.\n\n(b) Thereafter he is entitled to no leave allowance.\n\n(i) The corresponding leave under the Covenanted Civil Service Leave Rules in force before the 1st July, 1868, is \"Special Leave\" within the meaning of this Article.\n\n(c) An Officer on Special leave does not forfeit his past leave allowances by resigning the service without returning to India.\n\n351. A Military Officer in Civil employ, subject to the Military Furlough Rules of 1868, is entitled, during the first six months of his Special leave under Article 348, to an allowance of half his average salary, subject to a minimum of \u00a3250 a year. The title to this allowance is not affected by any leave previously taken under Rule XI. of the Furlough Rules of 1868.\n\nSUBSIDARY LEAVE.\n\n352. (a) Subsidiary Leave is the time allowed\u2014\n\n(i) To an officer leaving India on retiring from the Service, or on Furlough or Special leave, to break up his domestic establishment and travel to the port of embarkation, and\n\n(ii) To an officer returning to India from Furlough or Special leave, to travel from the port of debarkation and reorganise his domestic establishment.\n\n(b) The use of the words \"port of embarkation\" and \"port of debarkation\" in clause (a) limits the grant of Subsidiary leave to an officer leaving India by sea\u2014that is, at an Indian sea-port. No Subsidiary leave is admissible to an officer who does not leave India by sea.\n\n353. (a) The grant to an officer leaving India\u2014\n\n(i) of permission to retire from the service, or\n\n(ii) of Furlough or Special leave out of India, carries with it the grant of Subsidiary leave, including, in the case referred to in Article 352 (a), Clause (ii), Subsidiary leave on his return to duty.\n\n(b) An officer returning to India, without the permission of the authority which granted him leave, more than fourteen days before the end of his Furlough or Special leave, is not entitled to Subsidiary leave, save under the special orders of the Local Government.\n\n354. Leave in and out of India.\u2014(a) An officer (including a Military Officer subject to the Military Leave Rules) may take Furlough or Special leave partly in and partly out of India. But Subsidiary leave is not admissible unless the Furlough or Special leave begins or, as the case may be, ends, as Furlough or Special leave out of India.\n\n(b) If an officer going on Furlough or Special leave out of India is prevented by sickness or other urgent and adequate reason not within his own control, such\u2014for example, as the postponement of the departure of the vessel in which his passage is engaged,\u2014from embarking within his Subsidiary leave, the Local Government may order that his Furlough or Special leave shall begin in India at the end of the Subsidiary leave otherwise admissible, without forfeiture of his Subsidiary leave.\n\n355. Period admissible.\u2014The minimum Subsidiary leave is ten days; otherwise Subsidiary leave is calculated according to the rules and restrictions laid down in Chapter IX for \"Joining Time.\"\n\n359. Beginning and End of Leave.\u2014(a) Saving as provided in Article 354 (b), Furlough and Special leave out of India begin on, and include, the day of the departure of the vessel in which the officer sails, and if an officer remains in India after the end of Subsidiary leave, his Furlough or Special leave dates from the beginning of his Subsidiary leave, his Subsidiary leave being thereby cancelled. Similarly Furlough and Special leave out of India, end on, and include, the day before the arrival of the vessel in which the officer returns, and Subsidiary leave begins the day after.\n\nDefinition.\u2014The day on which the vessel in which the officer sails quits her moorings or anchorage, whether she leaves the limits of the port or not on that day is the day of the departure of the vessel. The day on which she reaches the vessel in which the officer returns is the day on which the vessel reaches her moorings or anchorage in port.\n\n360. Any Officer rather than one subject to the rules in Chapter XIV serving in Persia or Turkish Arabia may leave the country in which he is serving, or return to it, by any port or frontier town except Aden. The date of his departure or return must be certified by the British Consul, or, if there be no British Consul, by the officer himself.\n\n362. Leave Allowances.\u2014An officer on Subsidiary leave is entitled to allowances as follows\u2014\n\n(a) If the leave be Subsidiary to Special leave, and the officer have had leave subsidiary to a former Special leave\u2014no allowance.\n\n1. The corresponding leave under the Covenanted Civil Service Rules in force before the 1st July, 1868, is Special leave within the meaning of this clause.\n\n(b) If the leave be subsidiary to Ordinary Furlough or Special leave (otherwise than as provided in clause (a))\u2014the allowance admissible under Article 346, but calculated, in the case of a Covenanted Civil Servant or a Military Officer subject to the Civil Leave Rules, without the limitations of maximum or minimum prescribed by clauses (a) and (b) of Article 346. The limitations prescribed by clause\n(c) of Article 316 apply to the allowances of any other officer subject to this Article on Subsidiary leave.\n\n(e) If the leave be subsidiary to Furlough other than Ordinary:\u2014the allowance admissible under Article 347.\n\n(d) If the officer, under Article 261, have ceased to have a lien on a substantive appointment\u2014as, for example, if a Covenanted Officer has been absent on Extraordinary leave in extension of Furlough\u2014\n\n(i) in the case of a Covenanted Civil Servant or a Military Officer subject to the Civil Leave Rules:\u2014Subsistence Allowance; and\n\n(ii) in the case of any other officer subject to this Article:\u2014no allowance.\n\n(e) If the leave be preparatory to retirement:\u2014the allowances which would be admissible if the officer were proceeding on leave of such description as may be admissible to him; and if no leave is admissible:\u2014subsistence allowance only.\n\n363. An officer may draw allowances as if he were on Privilege leave, for any part of his Subsidiary leave under clause (i) of Article 352 (a) for which, if he were not retiring from the Service, or going on Furlough or Special leave, Privilege leave would be admissible to him. It is observed that an officer who has no lien on an appointment cannot benefit by this Rule. (See Article 295.)\n\n364. Lien.\u2014An officer on Subsidiary leave under clause (i) of Article 352 (a) has or has not a lien on an appointment according as he has or has not such lien on the first day of the leave to which it is subsidiary.\n\nNote.\u2014[A Military Officer subject to the Military Leave Rules does not lose his lien during Subsidiary leave preparatory to Furlough.]\n\n365. An officer on Subsidiary leave under clause (ii) of Article 352 (a) has or has not a lien on an appointment, according as he has or has not such lien on the day last preceding the Subsidiary leave.\n\nEXTRAORDINARY LEAVE.\n\n366. Subject always to the provisions of any Statute applicable to the case, the Local Government (or, if the officer be on Furlough or Special leave in Europe, the Secretary of State) may at discretion grant leave of absence from duty otherwise than under these Regulations: Provided that\u2014\n\n(i) such leave may not be granted in continuation of Privilege leave, but may be granted in continuation of any other leave;\n\n(ii) an officer absent from duty on leave so granted shall receive no absentee allowance; and\n\n(iii) if he is a Covenanted Civil Servant or a Military Officer subject to the Civil Leave Rules, he shall retain no lien upon any office.\n\nNote 1.\u2014[This Article does not refer to casual leave for short periods. Such leave is not recognised and is not subject to any rule. Technically, therefore, an officer on casual leave is not treated as absent from duty, and his salary is not interrupted. Casual leave however, must not be given so as to cause evasion of the rules regarding\u2014\n\n(i) Date of reckoning allowances (see Articles 64 to 70),\n\n(ii) Charge of office,\n\n(iii) Commencement & end of leave (see Articles 251 to 263),\n\n(iv) Return to duty or so as to extend the term of privilege or other leave beyond the time admissible by rule.]\n\nNote 2.\u2014[The prohibition to the grant of Extraordinary Leave in continuation of Privilege Leave applies to the combination of the two kinds of leave at the time of grant of Privilege Leave. If an application for Extraordinary Leave is made at or about the time of expiry of the Privilege Leave owing to circumstances which have arisen subsequently to the grant of the Privilege Leave, and which, in the opinion of the Local Government, are such as to justify the concession, then the leave may be sanctioned in continuation of Privilege Leave.]\n\nCHAPTER XIV.\n\nLONG LEAVE\u2014INDIAN SERVICES.\n\n367. The rules in this Chapter apply to all officers who are not entitled to leave under the other Chapters of these regulations. They apply fully only to those officers whose pay is not less than 100 rupees a month, and who have substantive appointments on permanent establishments under the Government.\n\n368. (a) Leave may however be granted under this Chapter to an officer whose pay is less than 100 rupees, so far as it can be done without imposing any cost upon the State. The absentee allowance of the substantive incumbent must not exceed what remains from the pay of the appointment after provision is made for the efficient discharge of his duties during his absence. No leave in excess of the leave admissible under these rules may be granted to such an officer, with allowances, or counting as service for pension.\n\n(b) This article authorises the grant of leave upon the condition therein stated, not only to an officer in Superior service whose pay is less than a hundred rupees a month, but to an officer whose service is treated as Inferior under the Pension Rules, upon the condition that the grant of the leave shall not impose any cost upon the State.\n\n369. Leave on medical certificate may be granted for three years in all, but not for more than two years at one time; and no officer can have leave on medical certificate out of India more than twice.\n\n370. Leave on Private affairs for six months may be granted to an Officer who has not had Furlough, after six years' service, and repeated after intervals of six years.\n\n1. Leave on Private Affairs does not accumulate, and cannot be taken in instalments.\n\n2. Leave on Medical Certificate counts as service for Leave on Private Affairs.\n\n371. Furlough may be granted as follows:\u2014\n\n(a) After ten years' service, one year or any less period, and thereafter at intervals of not less than eight years, one year or any less period; or\n\n(b) After eighteen years' service, two years or any less period, and thereafter at intervals of not less than eight years, one year or any less period:\n\nProvided that the service for furlough of an Officer who has had Leave on Private Affairs counts only from the date of his last return from such leave;\n\nProvided also that the aggregate amount of furlough or of furlough and Leave on Private Affairs taken together shall not exceed two years.\n\n1. Leave on Medical Certificate counts as service for Furlough.\n\n2. Leave on Private Affairs under the Rules in force before the 8th June, 1863, does not prevent the grant of Furlough under this Article.\n\n372. Extraordinary leave without allowances may, in case of necessity, be granted for such time as may be necessary. Time spent on Leave under this Article does not count as service for other Leave. Subject to the provisions of Article 292, there is no limit to the length or frequency of Leave under this Article, and it may be granted in continuation of Leave on Medical Certificate and Leave on Private Affairs, or Furlough, but not in continuation of Privilege Leave.\n\nI. An officer who has a temporary or officiating appointment only may, at the discretion of the Local Government, be allowed leave under this article for not more than three months.\n\nNote.\u2014[See notes to Article 363 which apply to this Article also.]\n\n373. Leave Allowances.\u2014(a) An Officer on Leave on medical certificate under Article 369 is entitled to half his average salary for the first fifteen months of each period of absence, but not for more than thirty months in all. For the rest of his leave under Article 369 he is entitled to a Quarter of his average salary.\n\n(b) An Officer on Furlough or on Leave on private affairs is entitled to half his average salary.\n\n374 (a). Half \"average salary\" is subject to the following maxima and minima:\u2014\n\nMAXIMA.\n\nIf paid at the Home Treasury of the Government of India, \u00a3150 a quarter.\n\nIf paid in India, Rs. 500 a month.\nMINIMA.\n\n(i) On leave on medical certificate out of India.\nIf paid at the Home Treasury of the Government of India, \u00a3200 a year, or three-fourths of last salary, whichever is less.\nIf paid in India, Rs. 166\u00bd a month, or three-fourths of last salary, whichever is less.\n\n(ii) On leave other than leave on medical certificate out of India.\nIn the case of non-gazetted officers whose salary is not less than Rs. 300 a month, Rs. 150 a month.\n(b) One quarter \"average salary\" is subject to the following maxima and minima:\n\nMAXIMA.\n\nIf paid at the Home Treasury of the Government of India, \u00a3120 a quarter.\nIf paid in India, Rs. 400 a month.\n\nMINIMA.\n\n(i) On leave on medical certificate out of India.\nIf paid at the Home Treasury of the Government of India, \u00a3100 a year, or 37\u00bd per cent. of last salary, whichever is less.\nIf paid in India, Rs. 83\u00bd a month, or 37\u00bd per cent. of last salary, whichever is less.\n\n(ii) On leave other than leave on medical certificate out of India.\nIn the case of non-gazetted officers whose salary is not less than Rs. 300 a month, Rs. 75 a month.\n\n375. All the rules in Article 375 are subject to the proviso that the allowances of an officer during leave shall in no case exceed his actual salary when he takes leave.\n\n376. An officer does not forfeit the allowances to which he is entitled under Articles 373 to 375 by resigning the service at the end of the leave.\n\n377. Leave after Fifty-five years of age \u2014 An officer in superior service who is subject to the rules of this Chapter is eligible, after he attains the age of fifty-five years, for Privilege leave, for any leave on private affairs (Article 370) to which he may be otherwise entitled, and also for leave without allowances under Article 372, provided that the total leave granted, whether on private affairs or without allowances, does not exceed six months in all, and for no other kind of leave. Any leave, other than Privilege leave or leave on private affairs, granted to such an officer before the date on which he attains the age of fifty-five, ceases to have effect on that date.\n\nSUBSIDIARY LEAVE.\n\n378. An Officer going on or returning from Leave out of India on Medical Certificate, Leave on Private Affairs, or Furlough, or going on or returning from Leave on Medical Certificate to a Sanitarium, is entitled to Subsidiary Leave under the Rules in Chapter XIII., Articles 352 and 354 to 365, and the grant of such leave carries with it the grant of Subsidiary leave including, as in the cases referred to in Article 352 (a) clause (ii) Subsidiary leave on his return to duty.\n\n379. Subsidiary Leave on half-pay for a period not exceeding fourteen days may be given to an Officer preparatory to his retirement from the Service, provided that the grant causes no additional expense to the State.\n\n380. (a) An Officer on Subsidiary Leave prefixed to other Leave is entitled to half his average salary. But he may draw allowances as if he were on Privilege leave, for any part of this leave for which, if he were not going on leave out of India, Privilege leave would be admissible to him.\n\n(b) An Officer on Subsidiary Leave following other Leave is entitled to half his average salary, or one quarter of his average salary, according to the rate of allowance to which he may be entitled at the end of the Leave to which it is subsidiary.\n\nPART IV.\u2014ORDINARY PENSIONS.\n\nCHAPTER XV.\n\nGENERAL RULES.\n\n381. The conditions of service of officers of the following classes include special rules for pension which are laid down in the chapters noted against each, viz.:\n\n(a) Judges of the High Courts (see Chapter XXIII.).\n\n(b) Barristers holding the appointments of Judge of the Chief Court of the Punjab, First Judge of the Small Cause Courts in Presidency towns, Recorder of Rangoon, and Secretary to the Government of India in the Legislative Department (see Chapter XXIV.).\n\n(c) Covenanted Civil Servants (see Chapter XXV.).\n\n(d) Statutory Native Civil Servants (see Chapter XXVI.).\n\n(e) Ecclesiastical officers (see Chapter XXVII.).\n\n(f) Civil Engineers and Telegraph Officers (see Chapter XXIX.).\n\n(g) State Railway Establishments (see Chapter XXXI.).\n\n(h) Bengal Covenanted Pilots and their families (see Chapter XXXII.).\n\n(i) Police Officers drawing less than Rs. 20 a month (see Chapter XX.).\n\n(j) Port Blair Police (see Chapter XXXIII.).\n\n382. The Pensions of all other officers are regulated by the rules in this Part, Provided that it is open to a Local Government to rule that the service of any class of officers serving under it does not qualify for Pension.\n\n383. Future good conduct is an implied condition of every grant of a pension. The Government reserves to itself the right of withholding or withdrawing a pension, if the pensioner be convicted of serious crime or be guilty of grave misconduct.\n\nCASES IN WHICH CLAIMS ARE INADMISSIBLE.\n\n384. In the following cases, no claim to pension is admitted:\n\n(a) When an officer is appointed for a limited time only, or for a specified duty, on the completion of which he is to be discharged.\n\n(b) When a person is employed temporarily on monthly wages without specified limit of time or duty; but a month's notice of discharge should be given to such a person, and his wages must be paid for any period by which such notice falls short of a month.\n\n(c) When a person's whole time is not retained for the public service, but he is merely paid for work done for the State.\n\n1. This clause applies, among others, to the following officers:\u2014Advocate General, Solicitor to Government, Government Pleaders and Law officers not debarred from private practice, Sheriffs in Presidency Towns, Coroners, Roman Catholic Priests.\n\n(d) When a public servant holds some other pensionable office he earns no pension in respect of an office of the kind mentioned in clause (c) or in respect of duties paid for by a Local Allowance.\n\n(e) When an officer serves under a covenant which contains no stipulation regarding pension unless the Government of India specially authorises an Officer to count such service towards pension.\n\n385. Pension may not be granted to an Officer whom it is desired to remove for misconduct, insolvency or inefficiency.\n\n386. Claims of Widows \u2014 (a) It being the duty of every Government Officer himself to provide for his family, the Government recognises no claim by a widow on account of the services of her husband, and is almost invariably under the painful necessity of rejecting recommendations made in contravention of this rule.\n\n(b) The submission of such recommendations, save under very extraordinary circumstances, is disapproved, as calculated only to give rise to hopes which cannot be fulfilled.\n\n387. Limitations \u2014 (a) An officer cannot earn two pensions in the same office at the same time, or by the same continuous service:\n\nExample.\u2014A soldier who obtains his discharge from the Army under Exception (i) in Article 388 is not entitled to any pension in the Military Department for\nthe portion of his military service which he will thereupon count as civil service.\n\n(b) Two Officers may not simultaneously count service in respect of the same office.\n\n388. Military Service.\u2014Service which is pensionable under Military Rules does not count; and an Officer who is counting service for Military pension cannot simultaneously count service for Civil pension,\u2014for example, an officer of the old Indian Navy in civil employ cannot count his naval service.\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\nCONDITIONS OF QUALIFYING SERVICE.\n\nBeginning of Service.\n\n390. (a) Except for compensation gratuity, an officer's service does not in the case of superior service qualify till he has completed twenty years of age.\n\n(b) In other cases, unless it be otherwise provided by special Rule or Contract, the service of every officer begins when he takes charge of the office to which he is first appointed.\n\nNote.\u2014[In every covenant with an Officer appointed in England by the Secretary of State, not being a Convenued Civil Servant or a Civil Engineer or Telegraph Officer educated at the Royal Engineering College, Coopers' Hill, or a Forest Officer, a clause is inserted to the effect that service for leave and pension begins only from the date on which the Officer joins his first appointment in India.]\n\n391. The following exceptions are admitted to the twenty years' rule:\u2014\n\n(i) The officers described in Articles 446 and 703. All officers appointed in England by the Secretary of State for service in India; and \"Indian College Engineers\" (see Article 690 (/)), are exempt from this disability.\n\nConditions of Qualification.\n\n393. The service of an Officer does not qualify for pension unless it conforms to the following three conditions:\u2014\n\nFirst. The service must be under Government.\n\nSecond. The employment must be substantive and permanent.\n\nThird. The service must be paid by Government.\n\nThese three conditions are explained in the following sections:\u2014\n\n394. First Condition.\u2014The service of an officer does not qualify unless he is appointed, and his duties and pay are regulated by the Government, or under conditions determined by the Government.\n\n403. Second Condition.\u2014Service does not qualify unless the officer holds a substantive office on a Permanent Establishment; but, upon such conditions as it may think fit in each case, to impose, the Government of India may allow temporary service to count for pension, if the pension does not exceed ten rupees a month.\n\n404. An establishment, the duties of which are not continuous, but are limited to certain fixed periods in each year, is not a temporary establishment. Service in such an establishment, including the period during which the establishment is not employed, qualifies; but the concession of counting as service the period during which the establishment is not employed, does not apply to an officer who was not on actual duty when the establishment was discharged, after completion of its work, or to an officer who was not on actual duty on the first day on which the establishment was again re-employed.\n\n405. An officer transferred from a temporary to a permanent appointment can count his service in the temporary office, if, though at first created experimentally or temporarily, it eventually becomes permanent.\n\n406. An officer without a substantive appointment officiating in an office which is vacant, or the permanent incumbent of which does not draw any part of the pay or count service, may, if he is confirmed without interruption in his service, count his officiating service.\n\n408. The service of a probationer who holds a substantive office and draws substantive pay, qualifies. So does that of an officer who is on probation for a substantive office, if he is employed in a vacancy reserved for him, pending probation, and in which no other Officer simultaneously counts service.\n\n409. Police probationers and temporary and officiating Assistant Superintendents of Police in all Provinces count their service towards pension, provided they have passed their examinations, have served two years in the Department, and have attained the age of 20 years.\n\n420. Third Condition.\u2014Service which satisfies the conditions prescribed in Sections II. and III., qualifies, or does not qualify, according to the source from which it is paid; with reference to this article Service is classified as follows:\u2014\n\n(a) Paid from General Revenues.\n\n(b) Paid from Local Funds.\n\n(c) Paid from Funds in respect of which the Government holds the position of Trustee.\n\n(d) Paid by Fees levied by Law, or under the authority of the Government or by Commission.\n\n(e) Paid by the grant, in accordance with Law or Custom, of a tenure in land, or of any source of income, or right to collect money.\n\n421. Service paid from the General Revenues qualifies. The fact that arrangements are made for the recovery on the part of the Government of the whole or part of the cost of an establishment or officer, does not affect the operation of this principle: Provided that the establishment or officer is appointed, controlled and paid by the Government.\n\n428. Service paid from a Local Fund qualifies, or does not qualify, according to the rules laid down in Chapter XXXVIII. (Service under Local Funds).\n\n429. Trust Funds.\u2014Service paid from Funds which Government holds only as a Trustee, such as under a Court of Wards or in an Attached Estate, does not qualify.\n\n430. Fees and Commission.\u2014(a) Service in an office paid only by fees, whether levied by law or under the authority of Government, or by a commission, does not qualify.\n\n(b) Service in an office paid by fees or by commission, in addition to pay from the General Revenues, qualifies.\n\nCHAPTER XVII.\n\nRULES FOR RECKONING SERVICE.\n\nSpecial Additions.\n\n441. For the purpose of calculating the amount of pension ordinarily admissible to an officer, not being a Native of Asia whose qualifying service began after 25 years of age, and whose service for which pension is claimed amounts to not less than ten years and has been passed wholly in one or other of the following offices, three years shall be added to the qualifying service:\u2014\n\n(i) Directors of Public Instruction.\n\n(ii) Inspectors of Schools.\n\n(iii) Principals and Professors of Colleges.\n\n(iv) Headmasters of Colleges and High Schools.\n\n(v) Barristers serving in offices, other than those mentioned in Chapter XXIV., to which the\n\nLocal Government has, with the consent of the Government of India, declared it to be necessary to appoint Barristers.\n\n1. The only office concerning which this declaration has been made is that of Deputy Superintendent and Remembrancer of Legal Affairs, Bengal.\n\n2. No officer is entitled to any special privilege under this Article by reason of his being a Barrister unless on first appointment to the Public Service he is appointed to a Barrister appointment (see Article 603).\n\n443. A period not exceeding one year of pensionable service is added to the service of any specially deserving officer who, during employment on Famine\nCHAPTER XVII.\u2014continued.\n\n445. (a) Time passed on leave in India other than Privilege or Subsidiary leave does not count as Superior Service. Time passed on leave subsidiary to leave on medical certificate by an officer subject to the Indian Service Leave Rules, who has twice before had leave on medical certificate out of India, does not count.\n\n(b) This Article applies to leave on medical certificate taken even before 1856, notwithstanding that such leave was reckoned as service under the Rules in Appendix No. 5.\n\n445-A. Time passed on leave with allowances out of India counts as service as follows:\n\nIf the service of the Officer He counts as service\nis not less than a period not exceeding\n15 years ... ... ... 1 year.\n25 \" \" \" 2 years.\n\n446. But the officers noted below count Furlough as service as follows:\n\nIf the service of the Officer He counts as service\nis not less than furlough to the extent of\n20 years ... ... ... 2 years.\n25 \" \" \" 3 \"\n30 \" \" \" 4 \"\n35 \" \" \" 5 \"\n\nIf the officer's service is not less than 15 years, he counts as service a period not exceeding one year spent on leave with allowances out of India.\n\n(a) Graded officers of the Geological Survey Department.\n\n(b) Officers of the Forest Department specially trained in Europe under regulations made by the Secretary of State or who have been specially admitted to the benefit of this Article.\n\n452. Deputation out of India.\u2014When an officer is deputed out of India on duty, the whole period of his absence from India counts. When an officer on leave out of India is detained on duty, the period of such detention counts.\n\n453. When, on the recommendation of the Government of India, an officer of the Public Works Department on furlough in Europe is employed in England by the Secretary of State on the inspection of stores for India, the period of such employment counts.\n\n454. Recall to duty.\u2014Time spent on the voyage to India by an officer who is recalled to duty before the expiry of any recognised leave, and (if, within a year from the date on which he can be spared, the officer takes the unexpired portion of the leave from which he was recalled), the time spent on the return voyage to Europe counts.\n\nSuspensions, Resignations, and Breaks in Service.\n\n458. (a) Time passed under Suspension pending inquiry into conduct counts, if the suspension is immediately followed by reinstatement.\n\n(b) Time passed under suspension adjudged as a specific penalty does not count.\n\n460. (a) Resignation of the Public Service, or removal from it for misconduct, insolvency, inefficiency, or failure to pass a prescribed examination, entails forfeiture of past service.\n\n(b) Resignation of an appointment to take up another appointment, service in which counts, is not held to be a resignation of the public service.\n\n461. Any authority who, on revision or appeal, reverses an order dismissing an officer, may declare that the past service of the reinstated officer counts.\n\n463. An interruption in the service of an officer entails forfeiture of his past service, except in the following cases:\n\n(a) Authorised Leave of Absence.\n\n(b) Unauthorised absence in continuation of authorised leave of absence, so long as the office of the Absentee is not substantively filled; if his office is substantively filled, the past service of the Absentee is forfeited:\nProvided that, if the Absentee is subsequently reinstated, the Authority whose duty it is to make the appointment, within three months, or, the Local Government, within one year, from the end of the authorised leave of absence, may declare, in an order to be communicated to the Audit Officer, that his previous service, or any part of it, shall not be forfeited.\n\n(c) Suspension immediately followed by re-instatement, which need not be to the same office.\n\n(d) Abolition of Office or loss of appointment owing to reduction of establishment.\n\n(e) Transfer to non-qualifying service in an establishment under Government control. The transfer must be made by competent authority; an Officer who voluntarily resigns Qualifying Service, cannot claim the benefit of this exception. Transfer to a Grant-in-aid school entails forfeiture.\n\n(f) Transfer to service on the Household Establishment of the Viceroy.\n\n(g) Loss of appointment owing to the Mutiny, provided that the Officer affected cleared his character and was re-appointed as soon as a suitable vacancy was found for him.\n\n(h) Time occupied in transit from one appointment to another, provided that the Officer is transferred under the orders of competent authority, or, if he is a non-gazetted Officer, with the consent of the Head of his old office.\n\n464. The Local Government may commute retrospectively periods of absence without leave into leave without allowances.\n\n465. Condonation of Interruptions.\u2014Upon such conditions as it may think fit, in each case, to impose\u2014\n\n(i) The Government of India may condone all interruptions in service not exceeding twelve months in all; and the Local Government may condone all interruptions not exceeding three months in all.\n\n(ii) If the proposed pension does not exceed fifty rupees a month, the Government of India may condone interruptions in service, whatever their duration; and the Local Government may exercise the same power if the pension is a provincial charge; otherwise it may condone interruptions not exceeding twelve months in all.\n\nCHAPTER XVIII.\n\nCONDITIONS OF GRANT OF PENSION.\n\nClassification of Pensions.\n\n466. Pensions for \u201cSuperior Service\u201d are divided into four classes, the Rules for which are prescribed in the following sections of this Chapter:\n\n(a) Compensation Pensions,\u2014see Section II.\n\n(b) Invalid Pensions,\u2014see Section III.\n\n(c) Superannuation Pensions,\u2014see Section IV.\n\n(d) Retiring Pensions,\u2014see Section V.\n\nCompensation Pension.\n\n468. A Compensation Pension is awarded to an officer discharged from the public service, because, on a reduction of Establishment his appointment is abolished, and other suitable employment cannot be found for him. An appointment, the pay of which is reduced as part of a general scheme of revision, is abolished within the meaning of this Article.\n\n469. To pension an officer still capable of useful service is a waste of public money; before a pension is granted to such an officer discharged on abolition of appointment, it must be carefully considered whether he cannot be otherwise provided for.\n\nInvalid Pension.\n\n485. An Invalid pension is awarded, on his retirement from the public service, to an officer who by bodily or mental infirmity is permanently incapacitated\u2014\n\n(i) For the Public Service, or\nChapter XVIII.\u2014continued.\n\n(ii) For the particular branch of it to which he belongs.\n\n486. If an officer applying for an Invalid pension is sixty years old or upwards, no certificate by a Medical Officer is necessary; it suffices for the Head of the office to certify to the incapacity of the applicant. Otherwise incapacity for service must be established by a Medical Certificate.\n\n488. Medical Officers must not give a certificate that inefficiency is due to old age or natural decay from advancing years, to any officer whose age is less than 55 years. In the case of any officer whose age is less than 55 years, the cause of inefficiency must be exactly stated.\n\n489. Form of Medical Certificate in England.\u2014The form of the medical certificate given by the Medical Board attached to the India Office respecting an officer applying for pension in England, is as follows:\n\nCertified that we have carefully examined A. B. of the Indian * * * His age is, by his own statement (x) years, and by appearance about (y) years. Looking at all the facts of his case and his present condition, we consider that he is so far incapacitated for further service in India that we recommend that he be permitted to retire from the service of Government on pension. So far as we are in a position to judge, his incapacity has not been occasioned by irregular or intemperate habits.\n\nNote.\u2014[If the incapacity is obviously the result of intemperance substitute for the words in italics: \"In our opinion his incapacity is the result of irregular or intemperate habits.]\n\n490. Restrictions.\u2014An Officer discharged on other grounds has no claim under Article 485, even although he can produce medical evidence of incapacity for service.\n\n498. If the incapacity is the result of irregular or intemperate habits, no pension can be granted. Otherwise, it is for the Local Government to decide whether the Officer's incapacity is such as to render it necessary to admit him to Invalid pension.\n\n499. Applicant to be Discharged.\u2014An Officer who has submitted under Article 486a Medical Certificate of incapacity for further service, must not (except for special reasons to be reported to the Local Government) be retained in active service pending a decision on his application for pension, nor can he obtain leave of absence. Without the further special sanction of the Local Government, service after the date of a Medical Certificate does not count for pension.\n\n500. The object of the preceding Article is to discourage tentative applications.\n\n501. Article 499 refers only to the retention in active service of an officer who has furnished a medical certificate in support of an application for invalid pension or gratuity while in India. The retirement of an officer who is absent on leave other than privilege leave, when such certificate is submitted may have effect from the termination of his leave, and the officer may continue to draw leave allowance to the end of his leave.\n\nSuperannuation Pension.\n\n502 A Superannuation Pension is granted to an Officer entitled or compelled, by Rule, to retire at a particular age.\n\n503. (a) An Officer in Superior service who has attained to the age of fifty-five years may be required to retire, unless the Local Government considers him efficient, and permits him to remain in the Service. But, as the premature retirement of an efficient Officer imposes a needless charge on the State, this Rule should be worked with discretion. And in cases in which the rule is enforced, a statement of the reasons for enforcing it shall be placed on Record by the Local Government or other competent authority.\n\n505. Officers in the Survey of India, of rank not lower than that of Assistant Surveyor, shall cease to be in employment on attaining the age of fifty-five years, unless specially permitted by the Secretary of State, in the interests of the public service, to remain in the Department for a further definite period.\n\n508. Optional Retirement at Fifty-five.\u2014An Officer in Superior Service, who has attained the age of fifty-five years, may, at his option, retire from the Service on a Superannuation pension.\n\nRetiring Pension.\n\n509. A Retiring Pension is granted to an Officer who voluntarily retires after completing qualifying superior service for thirty years or such less time as may for any special class of officers be prescribed.\n\n510. No officer may retire with the view of being re-employed, whether in the General Service or in service paid from Incorporated Local Fund and drawing pension in addition to pay.\n\n511. An officer holding two or more separate appointments may not, save with the express sanction of the Government of India in the Finance Department or, if pensions are a provincial charge, of the Local Government, resign one or more of such appointments on a pension, without retiring from the Public Service altogether. There is no objection to his being relieved from one or more of such appointments at any time, without being compelled to leave the service altogether but, in such case, any pension admissible to him for service in the office or offices from which he is relieved will be deferred until he finally retires.\n\nCHAPTER XIX.\n\nAmount of Pension.\n\nGeneral Rules.\n\n512. The amount of pension that may be granted is determined by length of service, as set forth in Articles 518 to 529. Fractions of a year are not taken into account in calculation of any pension admissible to an Officer under this Part of these regulations.\n\n513. Currency.\u2014A pension is fixed in rupees, and not in sterling money, even though it is to be paid in England.\n\n514. (a) The full pension admissible under the Rules is not to be given as a matter of course, or unless the service rendered has been really approved.\n\n(b) If the service has not been thoroughly satisfactory, the Local Government should make such reduction in the amount of pension as it thinks proper.\n\n515. Limitations.\u2014An officer entitled to pension may not take a gratuity instead of pension.\n\n517. An officer, not being a Military Officer or a Covenanted Civil Servant, transferred to service under a Colonial Government, on final retirement from the Colonial service on pension or Compensation allowance receives, at the charge of the Indian Revenues, for each completed year of qualifying and uninterrupted service in India, a pension of one-sixtieth of his average emoluments at the time of his transfer, such average emoluments to be calculated for the last five years, or, if the whole service in India is less than five years, for the whole period of service. The pension is subject to a maximum limit of Rs. 2,000 a year for an Indian service not exceeding ten years, and Rs. 4,000 a year in any other case.\nAMOUNT OF SUPERIOR PENSION.\n\n518 The amount of a pension is regulated by the length of service, as follows:\u2014\n\n(a) After a service of less than ten years a Gratuity not exceeding (except in special cases and under the orders of the Government of India) One Month's Emoluments for each completed year of service. If the Emoluments of the Officer have been reduced during the last five years of his service otherwise than as a penalty, Average Emoluments may, at the discretion of the Local Government, be substituted for Emoluments.\n\n(b) After a service of not less than ten years a pension not exceeding the following amounts:\n\n| Years of completed service | Scale of Pension | Maximum limit of Pension, a or a year month. |\n|---------------------------|-----------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| 10                        | 10 sixtieths of Average Emoluments. | 2,000 16\u00bd |\n| 11                        | \" \" \" \" \" \" \" \" | 2,200 18\u00be |\n| 12                        | \" \" \" \" \" \" \" \" | 2,400 200 |\n| 13                        | \" \" \" \" \" \" \" \" | 2,600 21\u00bd |\n| 14                        | \" \" \" \" \" \" \" \" | 2,800 23\u00be |\n| 15                        | \" \" \" \" \" \" \" \" | 3,000 250 |\n| 16                        | \" \" \" \" \" \" \" \" | 3,200 26\u00bd |\n| 17                        | \" \" \" \" \" \" \" \" | 3,400 28\u00be |\n| 18                        | \" \" \" \" \" \" \" \" | 3,600 300 |\n| 19                        | \" \" \" \" \" \" \" \" | 3,800 31\u00bd |\n| 20                        | \" \" \" \" \" \" \" \" | 4,000 33\u00be |\n| 21                        | \" \" \" \" \" \" \" \" | 4,200 350 |\n| 22                        | \" \" \" \" \" \" \" \" | 4,400 36\u00bd |\n| 23                        | \" \" \" \" \" \" \" \" | 4,600 38\u00be |\n| 24                        | \" \" \" \" \" \" \" \" | 4,800 400 |\n| 25 & above                | \" \" \" \" \" \" \" \" | 5,000 41\u00bd |\n\nNote.\u2014(For the Precise meaning of Average Emoluments, see Articles 539 and 531 of this Chapter.)\n\n519. In the following cases the several prescribed maximum limits of Rs. 2,000 to Rs. 5,000 prescribed in the preceding Article may be relaxed:\u2014\n\n(a) For an Officer whose Average Emoluments exceed Rs. 10,000 a year, and who entered the Service before the 19th May, 1855, or whose salary, before the 6th August, 1862, exceeded Rs. 10,000 a year, the maximum pension is ordinarily Rs. 5,000 a year. But if the service of such an Officer has been of extraordinary merit, a pension exceeding Rs. 5,000 a year may be recommended for the sanction of the Secretary of State.\n\n(b) To an Officer who entered the Service before the 19th May, 1855, but whose Average Emoluments do not exceed Rs. 10,000 a year, the Secretary of State, on the recommendation of the Government of India, sometimes grants a Special Pension in excess of the prescribed maximum, for unusually meritorious services.\n\n(c) For a Native Judge (see Part I of Appendix No. 5) who was in the service on the 23rd October, 1866, the limit is ordinarily Rs. 5,000 a year.\n\nNote.\u2014[The limits which may be relaxed under the foregoing Rules are the maxima money limits, and not the limits of from ten to thirty-sixtieths of \u201cAverage Emoluments\u201d referred to in the preceding Article.]\n\n520. An Invalid Pension on the following Scale, but not being less than Rs. 1,000 or more than Rs. 2,000 a year, may, if it is more favourable than the above, be granted:\u2014\n\n(i) to a graded Officer of the Geological Survey Department,\n\n(ii) to an officer of the Forest Department specially trained in Europe under regulations made by the Secretary of State, or who has been specially admitted to the benefit of this Article.\n\nIf the qualifying service of the officer be not less than\u2014\n\n| 10 years | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 |\n|----------|----|----|----|----|\n|          |    |    |    |    |\n|          |    |    |    |    |\n|          |    |    |    |    |\n\n521. (a) Reduction in Certain Cases.\u2014A superannuation pension, or an invalid pension granted on account of incapacity for further service due to old age or natural decay from advancing years, shall, if the Officer\u2019s Qualifying Service began after the 20th January, 1871, and after he attained the age of thirty years, be reduced by one-fortieth for every year or part of a year by which his age at the commencement of his qualifying service exceeded thirty years.\n\nNote.\u2014[Article 521 A. is not applied in calculating the second pension of an officer who is re-employed after discharge on compensation pension or gratuity.]\n\n(b) Gratuities are not subject to any reduction, and in the case of pensions the fixed limits are to be applied before, and not after, making the reduction.\n\n523. In the case of an Officer whose Qualifying Service began after he attained the age of thirty years, the attention of the Examining Medical Officer should always be called to article 521 (a) in order that he may adapt his Certificate accordingly.\n\nALLOWANCES RECKONED FOR PENSION.\n\n530. The term Emoluments when used in this part of the regulations means the emoluments which the officer was receiving immediately before his retirement, and include\u2014\n\n(a) Pay;\n\n(b) Personal allowance;\n\n(c) Fees or commission, if they are the authorised emoluments of an appointment, and are in addition to Pay. In this case \u201cEmoluments\u201d means the average earnings for the last six months of service;\n\n(d) Charge Allowance to Signallers in the Indian and Indo-European Telegraph Departments;\n\n(e) Commission in the case of a Thugyi in Lower Burma, \u201cEmoluments\u201d in this case being held to mean the average of his monthly receipts in commission during the five years\u2019 actual service previous to retirement; but see example (3) under Article 539.\n\n(f) Bullock Train and Punjab Military Horse Van Dak allowance in the Post Office Department;\n\n(g) Allowances attached to a Minor Professorship in a Medical College under the Medical Warrant of 1867;\n\n(h) Allowance attached to a Professorship or Lectureship in a Government Institution;\n\n(i) Acting allowances of an officer without a substantive appointment if the Acting service counts under Article 446, and allowances drawn by an officer appointed provisionally or substantively pro temor to an office which is substantively vacant and on which no officer has a lien, or to an office temporarily vacant in consequence of the absence of the permanent incumbent, on leave without allowances, or on transfer to Foreign Service.\n\n531. The term Average Emoluments means the average calculated upon the last five years of service.\n\n533. Any part of an officer\u2019s pay or emoluments, which is specially intended to provide for expenses incidental to his duty must be excluded.\n\nPART V.\u2014RULES APPLICABLE TO SPECIAL DEPARTMENTS OR SPECIAL OFFICERS.\n\nCHAPTER XXII.\n\nTHE GOVERNOR-GENERAL, GOVERNORS, LIEUTENANT-GOVERNORS, AND MEMBERS OF COUNCIL.\n\n589. The following is the Statute Law applicable to the Governor-General, Governors, and Members of Council who hold or enjoy pensions:\u2014\n\n\u201cProvided always and be it enacted, that if any Governor-General, Governor, or Ordinary Member of the Council of India, or any Member of the Council of any...\nCHAPTER XXII.\u2014continued.\n\nPresidency, shall hold or enjoy any Pension, Salary, or any Place, Office, or Employment of Profit under the Crown or any Public Office, or (a) the said Company (East India Company), or any annuity payable out of the Civil or Military Fund of the said Company, the salary of his Office of Governor-General of India, Governor, or Member of Council shall be reduced by the amount of the Pen-ion, Salary Annuity, or Profits of office so respectively held or enjoyed by him.\"\u2014(3 & 4 Will 4, Cap 85, s. 77.)\n\n590. If an Ordinary Member of Council hold or enjoy any pension or any annuity payable out of the Civil or Military Fund, the salary of his office of Member of Council is to be reduced under Acts 3 & 4 Will. 4, Cap. 85 s. 77, by the amount of the pension or annuity held by him. A good Service Pension enjoyed by Military Officers comes within the meaning of pen-ion under the Act cited above.\n\n591. (a) Leave on Medical Certificate for not more than six months may be granted to a Lieutenant-Governor. On resuming his duties after such Leave, a Lieutenant-Governor is entitled to half his salary for the period of his absence. If he is prevented from resuming his duties, he is entitled to no Absentee Allowances.\n\n(b) A Lieutenant-Governor is not entitled to any other Leave.\n\nMembers of Council.\n\n593. The tenure by a Member of Council of his office begins when he takes upon himself the execution of his office, and the resignation of his office by a Member of Council whose successor has not entered upon his office, takes effect from the day following that of his embarkation at any port in India, excluding Aden, or from the expiry of his five years' tenure of office whichever date is earlier.\n\n594. The leave admissible to an Ordinary Member of the Executive Council of the Governor-General, or of the Governor of Madras or Bombay, is regulated by Statute 24 & 25 Vic., cap. 67, s. 26, as follows:\u2014\n\nSection 26.\u2014It shall be lawful for the Governor-General in Council, or Governor in Council of either of the Presidencies, as the case may be, to grant to an Ordinary Member of Council, Leave of Absence, under Medical Certificate, for a period not exceeding six months, and such Member, during his absence, shall retain his Office, and shall, on his return and resumption of his duties, receive half his salary for the period of such absence; but, if his absence shall exceed six months, his Office shall be vacated.\n\n595. Subject to any special orders by the Government of India to the contrary, Leave of Absence granted to an ordinary Member of the Council of the Governor-General (if taken out of India) commences on the day after such Member embarks at any port in India, excluding Aden, and ends on the day before he disembarks at any port in India, excluding Aden: Provided always that such Member has not been relieved of the charge of his office until he embarks, and that he resumes charge immediately upon his disembarkation.\n\nCHAPTER XXIII.\n\nJUDGES OF THE HIGH COURTS.\n\nSTATUTORY RULES.\n\n600. The following Rules\u2020 are, under Statute 24 & 25 Vict., ch. 104, sect. 6, made by the Secretary of State in Council of India, consolidating and amending the rules fixing the salaries, allowances, furloughs, retiring pensions, and (when necessary) expenses for equipment and voyage of the Chief Justices and Judges of the several High Courts established under the said Statute.\n\n1. In these Rules, unless there is something repugnant in the subject or context,\u2014\n\n\"Acting Chief Justice\" means a Judge appointed under Sect. 7 of Statute 24 & 25 Vict., ch. 104, to perform the duties of Chief Justice of a High Court.\n\n\"Acting Judge\" means a person appointed under the said Section 7, to perform the duties of Judge of a High Court.\n\n\"Judge\" includes a Chief Justice and Acting Chief Justice, and an Acting Judge, except where the contrary is expressed.\n\n\"Actual Service\" includes,\u2014\n(a) Time spent by a Judge on duty as Judge, or in the performance of such other functions as he may be directed to discharge by the Governor-General of India in Council;\n(b) Time spent by a Judge on privilege or subsidiary leave;\n(c) Duty authorized Vacations (provided that the Judge is not absent on furlough or on extraordinary leave under Rule 26).\n\nSECTION I.\u2014SALARIES.\n\n2. The Chief Justice, or Acting Chief Justice, of the High Court at Calcutta shall be paid a salary at the rate of Rs. 72,000 per annum.\n\n3. The Chief Justice, or Acting Chief Justice, of the High Courts at Madras and at Bombay, and for the North-Western Provinces respectively, shall be paid a salary at the rate of Rs. 60,000 per annum.\n\n4. A Judge, or Acting Judge, of the High Courts at Calcutta, Madras, and Bombay, and for the North-Western Provinces, respectively, shall be paid a salary at the rate of Rs. 45,000 per annum; provided always, that every Judge of the High Court at Calcutta appointed before the 18th day of January, 1881, shall be paid a salary at the rate of Rs. 50,000 per annum.\n\nSECTION II.\u2014LEAVE.\n\n5. One year's furlough shall be placed to the credit of each Judge after the completion of the fourth, eighth, and twelfth years of actual service. Provided that the aggregate amount of all furlough which can, during the whole period of his service, be granted to a Judge shall not exceed three years; provided further that the maximum amount of furlough which may be taken at any one time is fifteen months.\n\n6. Except under Rules 8 and 9 no Furlough shall be granted until at credit under Rule 5. But any Judge already in the service of the Government at the time of being appointed to the High Court, who, when so appointed, was entitled, under the rules applicable to the branch of the service to which he belonged, to Furlough without Medical Certificate, may be granted Furlough for a term not exceeding that to which he was so entitled; provided that such Furlough shall not be taken until the completion of two years' actual service in the High Court, and shall not exceed one year.\n\n7. Except under Rules 8 and 9 Furlough shall not be granted until after the completion of three years' actual Service from the date of the last return from Furlough or from Extraordinary Leave.\n\n8. Under Medical Certificate, Furlough may be granted before it is at credit under Rule 5, and although three years' actual service may not have been completed since the last return from Furlough or from Extraordinary Leave.\n\n9. On urgent private affairs Furlough may be granted to a Judge before it is at credit under Rule 5, and although three years' of actual service have not been completed since the last return from Furlough or Extraordinary Leave; provided that Furlough under this Rule shall not exceed six months, and shall be granted only once during the whole period of a Judge's service.\n\n(*) (Sic. in original\u2014Query \"under.\") \u2020 Dated 11th May, 1891.\n10. Furlough taken in India shall be reckoned from the date on which the Judge quits his office to the date of his resuming duty. Furlough taken out of India shall be reckoned from the date of embarkation at the port of departure from India to the date of debarkation on return to India, except in a case falling under Rule 24.\n\n11. If Furlough be taken partly in India and partly out of India, the commencement and termination of the Furlough shall be respectively determined under the provisions of Rule 10, according as the Furlough begins or ends in or out of India.\n\n12. For the interval between the date of quitting his office and the commencement of Furlough out of India, and between the termination of Furlough out of India and resuming his office, a Judge may be allowed Subsidiary Leave not ordinarily exceeding thirty days, which in special cases may be extended.\n\n13. A Judge when on Furlough, shall receive allowances at the rate of Rs. 833-5-4 a month, if the Furlough be taken in India, and at the rate of \u00a31,000 a year, if the Furlough be taken out of India and payment be made in England. A Judge when on Subsidiary Leave, shall receive allowances at the rate of Rs. 833-5-4 a month.\n\n14. Except under Medical Certificate, the number of Furloughs to be granted at any one time, and the grant of Furlough to individual Judges, shall be subject to and limited by the exigencies of the service, which exigencies shall be determined exclusively by the authority with whom rests the question of granting the Furlough.\n\n15. Applications for Furlough not supported by medical certificate shall be granted usually in the following order:\u2014\n\nThe Judge who has the greatest amount of Furlough to his credit under Rule 5 shall have the preference. If two or more applicants are on an equality in this respect, preference shall be given to the applicant whose actual service in a High Court is longest, reckoning, in the case of a Judge who has not taken Furlough or Extraordinary Leave, from the date of the commencement of his service in the High Court, and in the case of a Judge who has taken Furlough, Subsidiary, or Extraordinary Leave, from the date of his last return from such Furlough or Extraordinary Leave. If two or more applicants are equal in both the above-mentioned respects, the preference shall be given to the senior in the Court.\n\n16. Subject to the exigencies of the public service, a Judge who has completed eleven months' continuous duty, including the Vacation, may take Privilege Leave for one month in each year, but except as provided in Clause (a) his salary will cease during such Leave. A Judge may not take Privilege Leave in instalments, or more than a month at a time; and, except as provided in Clause (b), Privilege Leave may not be combined with Vacation.\n\n(a) A Judge who has been detained on duty as Vacation Judge may, provided that he has not in the meantime had any furlough or leave of any kind, during his next subsequent privilege leave draw his salary for any period, not exceeding one month in the whole by which his Vacation may (by reason of his being on duty) have fallen short of one month.\n\n(b) Once in three years, and not oftener, Privilege Leave may be prefixed or annexed to the Vacation.\n\n17. Rule 16 does not apply to the following Judges:\u2014\n\nT. Muthuswami Aiyar ............. Madras.\nRayley, L. H. ....................... Bombay.\nPrinsep, H. T. ...................... Calcutta.\nSargent, Sir C., Knt. .............. Bombay.\nStraight, D. ......................... N.-W. P.\nTottenham, L. R. .................. Calcutta.\nWilson, A. ......................... Calcutta.\n\n18. Privilege Leave may be granted to any of the Judges named in Rule 17, under the following Rules:\u2014\n\n(1) Subject to the exigencies of the public service, Privilege Leave for one month may be granted to a Judge who has been on duty without interruption for eleven months, including the Vacation.\n\n(2) An additional Month of Privilege Leave accrues to a Judge after each further period of eleven months' continuous duty, including the Vacation.\n\n(3) Privilege Leave may not be taken in instalments, but any balance of Privilege Leave not taken when due may be added to the next Privilege Leave which accrues: Provided that the Privilege Leave taken at one time shall not exceed three months, and that any accumulation of Privilege Leave beyond that period shall be forfeited.\n\n(4) Save as provided in the next succeeding Clause (5), a Judge when on Privilege Leave shall receive half his salary.\n\n(5) A Judge who discharges the duties of Vacation Judge during the whole or any part of a Vacation, shall be entitled, for each day of such duty, to draw his full salary for one day of any Privilege Leave which he may subsequently obtain.\n\n19. Every Judge applying for Privilege Leave must sign a declaration that he intends to return to duty on the expiration of the Leave applied for, and that he has no intention of resigning his office or retiring from the Service, or taking leave of any kind within three months after his return to duty. Such declaration shall not be held absolutely to debar the person making it from applying for permission to resign his office, or to retire from the Service, or to take leave, within three months after his return to duty: but every such application must be accompanied by an explanation of the special circumstances under which it is made, and it shall be in the absolute discretion of the Government to grant or withhold the permission sought.\n\n20. Furlough and Privilege Leave shall not be taken as such, in continuation of each other; but if a Judge absent on leave of one of these kinds is allowed to change it for Leave of the other kind, the whole period of his absence shall be held to be under Leave of the latter kind.\n\n21. Applications for Leave shall in all cases be submitted in such manner as the Government shall, from time to time, prescribe.\n\n22. Leave Allowance shall be payable monthly if payment is made in India, and quarterly if in England.\n\n23. No substantive appointment shall be vacated, merely by reason of Leave being granted under these Rules.\n\n24. If a Judge overstays any Leave, he shall forfeit all salary during the time of his remaining so absent; and if he overstays his Leave for more than one week, his office shall be liable to be declared vacant. But a Judge on Leave (other than Leave under Rules 16 or 18) is not obliged to return to duty on an authorized holiday, unless another Officer is officiating as Judge in consequence of his absence. Vacation is not an authorized holiday within the meaning of this Rule; and a Judge whose furlough terminates at the commencement of or during a vacation shall not be entitled to full pay for any part of the period of such vacation (except a part subsequent to his return to duty). If, after the termination of his furlough, he remains absent during the whole or any part of a vacation, he will, for such period of absence, draw the leave allowances, admissible under Rule 13, but the time will count as actual service, not as furlough, provided that he returns to duty immediately at the end of the vacation.\n\n25. No Leave, except Privilege Leave and Leave Subsidiary to Furlough shall count as service for pension.\n\n26. If the Government shall in its discretion deem it necessary, in any special instance, to grant to any Judge Leave of Absence which is not expressly pro-\nChapter XXIII.\u2014continued.\n\nvided for in the foregoing Rules, such Leave shall be without pay. Provided always, that in no case shall such Leave exceed six months, or be granted more than once in the whole course of the Judge's service.\n\nLeave under this Rule is termed \"Extraordinary\" Leave.\n\nSection III.\u2014Pensions.\n\n27. A Chief Justice of the High Court at Calcutta after an actual service of fourteen and a half years as Judge of a High Court, of which period at least seven years shall have been as Chief Justice of the High Court at Calcutta, shall receive a pension not exceeding \u00a31,800 per annum.\n\n28. A Chief Justice of the High Courts at Madras and Bombay, and for the North-Western Provinces, respectively, after an actual service of fourteen and a half years as Judge of a High Court, of which period at least seven years shall have been as Chief Justice, shall receive a pension not exceeding \u00a31,500 per annum.\n\n29. A Judge of a High Court, not being eligible for pension at a higher rate under Rule 27 or 28, shall, after an actual service of fourteen and a half years as Judge, receive a pension not exceeding \u00a31,200 per annum.\n\n30. A Chief Justice or Judge shall, after an actual service of ten years, receive a pension according to the following graduated table:\n\n| Years of Actual Service | Chief Justice, Calcutta | Chief Justice Madras and elsewhere | Judge |\n|------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------|\n| 10                     | 1,200                   | 1,000                             | 800   |\n| 10\u00bd                    | 1,320                   | 1,100                             | 880   |\n| 11\u00bd                    | 1,440                   | 1,200                             | 960   |\n| 12\u00bd                    | 1,560                   | 1,300                             | 1,040 |\n| 13\u00bd                    | 1,680                   | 1,400                             | 1,120 |\n\n31. A Chief Justice or Judge who retires on medical certificate after six years and nine months' actual service shall receive a pension not exceeding, in the case of a Chief Justice of the High Court at Calcutta, \u00a3700 per annum; in the case of the Chief Justice of any other High Court, \u00a3600 per annum; and in the case of a Judge of a High Court, \u00a3500 per annum.\n\n32. In the event of a Judge receiving a pension under the preceding Rules, he will not be entitled to any other pension or retiring allowance.\n\n33. When a Judge, who at the time of his appointment to a High Court was a member of one of the Government Services in India, is permitted to retire without a pension under the preceding Rules, he shall receive such a pension as he might receive under the Rules applicable to the branch of the Service to which he belonged when so appointed, reckoning the period of his service as a Judge of a High Court towards service for that pension.\n\n34. If a Judge who, at the time of his appointment to a High Court, was a member of one of the Government Services in India, shall be permitted to retire on medical certificate after six years and nine months of actual service as Judge, he shall have the option of taking his pension or retiring allowance either under these Rules or under the Rules applicable to the branch of the service to which he belonged when appointed.\n\n35. No Judge, selected from the Covenanted Civil Service, shall receive any pension under these Rules unless he shall have fully complied with all the rules and regulations in force for the time being as to payments to be made by him as a member of the Covenanted Civil Service on account of the provision for his own pension or retiring allowance, and for pensions to his wife and children.\n\n36. If a Judge be transferred from one High Court to another, the period he shall have served in each Court shall count towards his qualification for pension.\n\n37. If a Judge be appointed to be a Chief Justice in the Court in which he has theretofore served or in another Court, the period of his service as Judge will count for pension according to the rate of a Judge's pension, and the period of his service as Chief Justice will count for pension according to the rate of pension of a Chief Justice of the Court to which he may have been appointed.\n\n38. If a Chief Justice of the High Court at Madras, at Bombay, or for the North-Western Provinces be appointed Chief Justice of the High Court at Calcutta, his period of service in the Court from which he is transferred will count for pension according to the rate of pension of a Chief Justice of that Court, and his period of service as Chief Justice of the High Court at Calcutta will count for pension according to the rate of pension of a Chief Justice of the High Court at Calcutta.\n\n39.

Foreign service is of three kinds, viz:\n\nFirst.\u2014When an officer of Government is allowed to take service under an employer who is not under the orders of Government and is allowed while in such service to maintain his claim to pension and leave in the same way as if he were still in the service of Government.\n\nExamples.\u2014Officers lent to Egypt or to the Colonies or to a Native State or a Port Trust or a Municipality or a Railway Company.\n\nSecond.\u2014When Government having obtained control over or having received in trust certain funds other than General Revenues, creates special appointments or special establishments at the cost of the said funds for the purpose of exercising such control or trust.\n\nExamples.\u2014Administrators of Native State, Managers of Courts of Wards' Estates, Officers serving in Berar.\n\nThird.\u2014When additions are made to an existing service or an existing establishment to provide for work which has to be done under the supervision and control of the supervising and controlling officers of the service or establishment, the cost of the additions being charged to, or recovered from, the persons or bodies in whose interest the work is done.\n\nExamples.\u2014Political Agents appointed at the cost of the States concerned; Assistant Opium Agents in Native States and their Establishments; Establishments employed in Government offices for the control of local funds, the members of which are appointed and con-\ntrolled by Government, but the cost of which is recovered from the foreign service or local funds concerned.\n\n803. (a) Foreign service of the first and second kinds qualifies for leave and pension or for pension only in the case of officers transferred by competent authority from qualifying service under Government with the privilege of retaining their title to leave or pension, which in all but special cases is made subject to payment of contributions to Government in respect of the cost of such leave or pension.\n\n(b) Foreign service of the third kind qualifies for leave and pension in the same way as service in the rest of the department or establishment, of which the appointment forms a part; but arrangements are made for the recovery of the cost, as laid down in Chapter XXXVII.\n\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\n\nFOREIGN SERVICE OF THE FIRST AND SECOND KINDS.\n\n806. Sanction to Transfer.\u2014An officer may not be transferred to Foreign service of the first kind unless the following conditions are complied with:\n\n(i) The service required of the officer transferred is one which it is advantageous for public reasons (and not merely in the interest of the officer concerned) should be provided for by a servant of the British Indian Government.\n\n(ii) The transfer is made by, or with the consent of, the Local Government under which the officer is serving, and also if he is transferred for service under a Native State and the pay offered exceeds Rs. 250 a month, with the consent of the Government of India in the Foreign Department.\n\nThe sanction of the Government of India is also required to the transfer of any officer to the service of Her Majesty\u2019s Government in England or of any Colonial or Foreign Government. The consent of the Government of India is not required in the case of an officer appointed to officiate during the absence of the permanent incumbent of a sanctioned appointment in a Native State, provided that the officiating allowance is regulated in accordance with Part II.\n\n(iii) The officer transferred either has ten years\u2019 qualifying service (for pension) under Government or belongs to one of the following services:\u2014The Covenanted Civil Service; the Army; the \u201cCommission\u201d of any non-regulation Province; the graded Political Departments; the Superior Service of the Public Works (including Railway Revenue and Account Branches), Telegraph, Survey, or Forest Department; the graded Educational Service; the Indian Marine.\n\nNote.\u2014[Service under a landholder who retains the management of his own estate is not \u201cForeign Service\u201d for the purposes of these regulations, unless, in an altogether exceptional case, the importance of the estate or its owner is such as to justify the transfer of the services of a Government officer to occupy an important position, such as manager, &c.]\n\n(iv) The officer transferred shall receive only the remuneration agreed upon or sanctioned by the Local Government or the Government of India, as the case may be, in his behalf.\n\n(v) The officer transferred shall remain, while on Foreign service, subject to the general and disciplinary rules which apply to officers on active Government service.\n\n807. Salary from Foreign Employer.\u2014The consent of the Government of India in the Foreign Department is required to any increase to the salary of an officer already transferred to the service of a Native State, which has the effect of raising the officers\u2019 net salary above Rs. 250 a month.\n\nAnd also to any increase to a net salary which, before the increase, exceeds Rs. 250 a month.\n\n808. Contribution required.\u2014Whatever may be the actual pay and allowance drawn by an officer in Foreign service from his employers, his salary, for the purpose of calculating his leave allowances and pension, and of requiring a contribution towards the cost of such leave allowances and pension, shall be assumed to be as follows:\u2014\n\nIf he is a member of any of the special services mentioned in Article 806 (iii)\u2014but special cases is made subject to payment of contributions to Government in respect of the cost of such leave or pension.\n\nExample.\u2014If an officer\u2019s furlough allowance is subject to a maximum of \u00a3250 per quarter, and the official rate of exchange for the year is 1 shilling 4 pence per rupee, the maximum on which a contribution is required would be Rs. 2,500 per mensem. If the furlough allowance is subject to a maximum of \u00a3120 per quarter, the maximum on which a contribution is required would be Rs. 1,200 per mensem.\n\nNote.\u2014[Percentage deductions (e.g., for Civil Fund in the case of a Covenanted Civil Servant) will be calculated upon the \u201cassumed salary.\u201d]\n\n(b) If the officer is not a member of any of the above services, then\u2014\n\n(i) If he belongs to a graded service, his name will be retained on it (as seconded), promotion from grade to grade being given to him in due course, and his assumed pay will be that of the grade in which from time to time he is.\n\n(ii) If he does not belong to a graded service, the assumed pay will be, and will remain, that which he last drew when in Government employ.\n\n809. (a) From every officer transferred in the manner specified in Article 806, who does not wholly resign the service of the British Government, or who is not, for recorded special and public reasons, exempted from the operation of the rules in this chapter, a contribution is levied as follows:\u2014\n\n(i) In the case of officers of the special services mentioned in Rule 806 (iii), on account of leave allowances (excepting privilege leave) and pension\u2014one fourth of the assumed pay. Provided that in the case of an officer whose pension is subject to the maximum of Rs. 5,000 a year the contribution shall not be calculated on a higher salary than (a) of Rs. 1,250 a month in the case of officers subject to European Service leave rules, and (b) of Rs. 1,000 a month in the case of officers subject to Indian Service leave rules.\n\nNote.\u2014[In the case of officers subject to European Service leave rules a higher limit has been fixed because of the higher maximum furlough allowance drawn by them.]\n\n(ii) In the case of others, on account of pension only\u2014one-eighth of the assumed pay. Provided that, in the case of an officer whose pension is subject to the maximum of Rs. 5,000 a year, the contribution will not be calculated on a higher salary than Rs. 833\u00bd a month.\n\n(b) An officer is not permitted to withhold the contribution upon condition that the time of his Foreign service shall not count for pension or leave; he must either wholly resign the British service or, unless he is\nspecially exempted, make the contribution required by this Article.\n\n810. (a) The rates of Contribution prescribed in the preceding Article apply to all transfers to Foreign service made after 7th January, 1889, the date of Finance Department Resolution No. 199. For officers who have already been transferred to Foreign service, the rates hitherto in force will continue to operate, until the new rates are applied under the orders, in each case, of the Local Government which has transferred the services of the officers concerned. But in all cases in which, under existing rules, the salary of an officer may not be increased without the sanction of the British Government such sanction will, in future, if the officer remains under the old rates of contribution, be subject to the condition that the increase shall not be liable to contribution and shall not be reckonable for any purpose of leave allowances or pension. This condition, however, does not apply to officers of the Public Works Establishment who have already been transferred to the service of Railway Companies upon conditions agreed upon between the Companies and the Government.\n\n(b) Previous to the issue of the Resolution of 7th January, 1889 above referred to, the rates of contribution were determined by the following Rules:\n\nFrom every officer transferred to Foreign service who does not wholly resign the service of the British Government, or who resigns for recorded special and public reasons, exempted from the operation of this Rule, a contribution is levied as follows:\n\n(A) In the case of a Covenanted Civil Servant\u2014at the rate of 16\u00bd per cent. (one-sixth) on the gross salary which he receives from his Foreign employers.\n\n(B) In the case of any other officer;\u2014at the rate of 14\u00bd per cent. (one-seventh) on the gross salary which he receives from his Foreign Employers; provided always that the contribution from a Civil officer other than a Covenanted Civil Servant or a Civil Engineer shall in no case exceed Rs. 166\u00bd a month, and from a Civil Engineer, Rs. 233\u00bd a month.\n\nThat is to say, the officer receives from his Foreign Employers salary fixed in accordance with the scales of the public service for the appointment which he holds or in which he officiates, and retaining five-sixths or six-sevenths accordingly as he is an Officer of Class (A) or (B), pays one-sixth or one-seventh, as the case may be, to the Government of India.\n\n811. Service in Egypt.\u2014Officers transferred for service under the Egyptian Government shall contribute for pension only. Such contributions shall, in the case of all officers transferred on or after the 1st of April, 1890, be regulated by the provisions of Articles 815 and 809. The rate leviable in the case of officers of the special services mentioned in rule 806 (iii) will be one-sixth of their assumed pay, which represents the proportionate share on account of pension only, of the one-fourth prescribed in Article 809 (a) (i) on account of both leave and pension. Service in Egypt will in no case count as service towards Indian furlough. To officers transferred before 1st of April, 1-90, Article 811 as published in the first edition of the Civil Service Regulations will continue to apply.\n\nNote (1).\u2014In the case of a Military Officer, the contribution prescribed covers the liability of Indian revenues for temporary half pay, or half-pay pension in any case of an officer losing his health during Egyptian service before becoming entitled to ordinary so-called full-pay pension.\n\nNote (2).\u2014See note under Article 828 (c).\n\n812 Foreign Service during Leave.\u2014(a) When the services of an officer are lent for employment out of India either to Her Majesty's Government in England, or to any Colonial or Foreign Government, the officer shall make a contribution to the Indian Exchequer in accordance with the rules in this Chapter.\n\n(b) But if an officer while absent on furlough is permitted to take employment of the above kind, or if an officer is allowed to take furlough for the purpose of taking such employment, he may draw his furlough allowance from Indian revenues in addition to any allowance which may be assigned to him for the employment; in this case the contribution is not required for the period of the officer's employment as above, but will be payable from the date of the expiry of the furlough should the officer continue in it. Service under Her Majesty's Government in England or under any Colonial or Foreign Government outside of India will in this case be held to begin from the date of the expiry of the furlough.\n\n813. No officer employed as above on any duty unconnected with India shall, except as provided in Articles 812 and 814, receive any allowances from Indian revenues while so employed.\n\n814 If an officer is at the time of his transfer entitled to privilege leave and obtains it with the avowed intention of taking employment under the Egyptian Government, he may draw his privilege leave allowances from Indian revenues in addition to any allowances which may be assigned to him by the Egyptian Government without being required during the period of leave to make the contribution for pension in respect of employment in Egypt. The right to receive privilege leave allowances is, however, contingent on his return to duty under the Indian Government on the expiry of the leave; if, therefore, an officer continues in the service of the Egyptian Government after the end of seven days from the date of the expiry of his privilege leave, the leave will be considered as cancelled, and the officer's Foreign service will be held to have begun on the date from which he availed himself of his privilege leave.\n\nTemporary Transfers.\n\n815. (a) No contribution is levied from an officer who is transferred to Foreign service for a special temporary duty not lasting more than six months, provided that exemption can only be claimed under this Article if it is specially provided for from the beginning as part of the terms of the arrangement under which the officer's services are transferred.\n\n(b) In determining whether contributions are payable or not, the point to be considered is the duration of the appointment or duty to which the officer is transferred and not the duration of the particular officer's employment in the appointment or on the special duty.\n\n816. The Local Government may remit the contribution for any period during which an officer on Foreign service is temporarily employed under the British Government on duties additional to, or distinct from, his duties on Foreign service.\n\nRules for Payment of Contribution.\n\n826. If the salary of an officer is paid under the orders of the Accountant General at a British Government Treasury, the required contribution is deducted at time of payment. In all other cases the officer himself must pay the amount directly to the British Government in the manner prescribed in the following rules;* the Government will not ordinarily enter into any direct arrangements with the Foreign employers of its officers or make any direct demands upon them.\n\nGeneral Conditions of Service.\n\n835. (a) In return for the contributions prescribed in Article 809 (a) (i) (Foreign Service of the first kind), the Government accepts the charge for the officer's pension, and also that for his absence allowances (except on privilege leave, when the Government will pay only its share, according to the Rule of Proportions calculated on the assumed pay referred to in Article 808 (a), and during which the contribution must be paid in the same manner as if the officer were on duty), in the same manner and to the same extent as if he were in regular service of the British Government, saving only that the calculation of pension or absentee allowance is based upon the pay upon which he contributes (see Article 808) and not upon the amount which he receives from his Foreign employer.\n\nNote.\u2014In calculating the leave allowances of a Covenanted Civil Servant one twenty-fourth must be added to the assumed or actual salary, in order to provide for the four per cent. annuity deduction. For example, if the average salary is Rs. 960 (net) the half average fixed for leave allowance will be Rs. 500 and not Rs. 480, because the leave allowance of Rs. 500, being subject to four per cent. deduction, the net amount payable will be only Rs. 480.\n\n(b) In regard to the contribution prescribed in Article 809 (a) (ii), the Government accepts the charge for the officer's pension only, but not for his absentee allowances, of which the British Government will thenceforth only pay its share according to the Rule of Proportions calculated on the assumed pay referred to in Article 808 (a).\n\n* Omitted from this Abstract.\n836. In return for the contribution prescribed in clauses (a) and (b) of Article 823 (Foreign Service of the Second kind), the Government accepts the charge of the officer's pension and absentee allowances (except during privilege leave when the Government will pay only its share according to the Rule of Proportions, and during which the contribution must be paid in the same manner as if the officer were on duty), in the same way as if he were in its own service.\n\n837. An officer who contributes for pension only must, during privilege leave, pay his contribution in the same manner as if he were on duty, and if, after return to his British appointment, he takes privilege leave, a portion of which is earned by Foreign Service, he will receive from the General Revenues the Government share of his leave allowance, according to the Rule of Proportions, and must pay to the General Revenues the contribution required by Article 829 (a) (ii) for that portion of his privilege leave which was earned by his Foreign service.\n\n838. The pension and leave of an officer on Foreign service, whether acting or permanent, are regulated by the rules which apply to officers of the Government of India. And an officer may not get leave unless he actually quits duty and proceeds on leave.\n\n839. Subject to the regular rules, any saving arising from the absence of a permanent officer accrues to his employer, except when an officer is exempted from the payment of the contribution prescribed in Article 80J [see Article 817, Exception (f)], when the saving should be paid to the British Government.\n\nPensions from Native States.\n\n840. Except with the sanction of the Government of India, no officer belonging to the service of, or in receipt of a pension from, the British Government, who is transferred to service under a Native State, may accept a pension or gratuity from such State.\n\nLien on Government Appointment.\n\n843. An officer so transferred when he returns to British service is entitled to resume the same position as that in which he left it; if he holds a progressive appointment his Foreign service does not count towards increments; and he cannot return to acting service under the British Government without reverting also to his substantive British office, the locum tenens of this office thereupon falling back upon acting allowances. (See also Rule 1 under Article 79.)\n\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\n\nService Under Local Funds.\n\n857. Apart from any special provisions, service paid for from a Local Fund does not qualify for pension.\n\nPART IX.\u2014PROCEDURE RELATING TO LEAVE.\n\nCHAPTER XL.\n\nApplications for and Grant of Leave.\n\n889. (a) Except as provided in Articles 968 to 916 of this chapter, every application for leave should be submitted to the Local Government, or other authority whose duty it would be to fill up the appointment of the applicant if it was vacant.\n\n1. When a gazetted Officer applies for leave, he should quote the article or section of the Civil Service Regulations under which he considers himself entitled to the leave.\n\n891. An officer applying for Privilege leave must record a declaration that he has no intention of retiring or of taking Furlough, Special leave, Subsidiary leave, leave on Private Affairs, or leave on Medical Certificate, for three months after his return to duty. Though not absolutely debarred by this declaration from applying for permission to retire or to take such leave within the three months, he should, if he does so, explain his change of mind.\n\nMedical Certificate.\n\n900. If the officer is going on leave out of India, he should take with him one copy of the medical report upon his case.\n\n901. A duplicate of the medical report upon the case of an officer going to Europe on leave on medical certificate should be forwarded direct to the India Office, addressed to the Under-Secretary of State for India, by the Local Government under which the officer is employed, for the information of the Medical Board attached to the India Office, so as to arrive as soon as the officer reaches England. No delay should be allowed to occur in the transmission of the duplicate report to the India Office.\n\n902. If an applicant for an extension or commutation of Leave on medical certificate be residing out of India, and within sixty miles from London, he must produce a certificate from the Medical Board attached to the India Office, showing the necessity for the extension or commutation. If he be residing more than sixty miles from London, certificates must be produced from two medical practitioners; and he may be called upon to produce other evidence.\n\nGrant of Leave.\n\n908. Leave may be granted with retrospective effect from the date on which it is admissible.\n\n909. Unless specially otherwise ordered, Leave must begin within thirty-five days of the date on which it is granted.\n\nRules regarding Chaplains.\n\n917. Applications for leave from Chaplains on the Bengal Ecclesiastical Establishment, and from Chaplains on other establishments serving in the Bengal Presidency are dealt with under the Rules in this section, the priority of claim being determined in accordance with Chapter XII., Article 542.\n\n918. Subject to the exigencies of the Public Service, Local Governments in the Bengal Presidency are empowered, with the concurrence of the Bishop of the Diocese, to grant any Furlough or Special leave authorised by these Regulations to Chaplains serving within their respective jurisdictions.\n\n919. If a Chaplain applying for Furlough or Special leave belong to the Madras or Bombay Ecclesiastical Establishment the Local Government under which he is serving will, if the Furlough or leave be granted, inform the Government of Madras or Bombay, as the case may be.\n\n920. The Bishop of the Diocese is empowered to grant privilege leave to Chaplains under Article 656 subject to the public exigencies, of which the Bishop shall be judge. But the grant, cancellation, or extension of such leave should be reported to the Local Government concerned.\n\n922. Except under orders of the Secretary of State, the term of Furlough or Special leave cannot be altered without the permission of the Government by which it may have been granted.\n\n923. Every Chaplain who obtains leave shall supply himself with a Last-pay certificate, and with a statement showing the allowances which he is entitled to draw while absent. It shall be the duty of the Accountant General to furnish these documents (see Chapter XII.), and no leave allowances will be payable without their production.\n\nNote.\u2014(If a Chaplain's term of twenty-five years service expires (see Article 664) during his leave, or during the period to which it is stated that it may be extended, the fact should be noted on the last-pay certificate.\n\n924. A Chaplain shall report his return to duty to the Bishop, and to the Local Government by which his leave or Furlough may have been granted.\n\n925. If any Local Government shall see fit to refuse a Furlough to any Chaplain on the ground of the exigencies of the Public Service, it shall report such refusal for the confirmation of the Government of India.\n\n926. Applications for leave from Chaplains on the Madras and Bombay establishments are made in accordance with the foregoing rules, but Article 925 applies only to Chaplains on the Bengal establishment.\nCHAPTER XLII.\n\nPAYMENT OF LEAVE ALLOWANCES.\n\n936. Place of Payment.\u2014Leave allowances are payable in India after the end of each calendar month; but an officer on Furlough or Special leave out of India may, at his option, take payment at the Home Treasury of the Government of India and, if he proceeds to any colony named in the list in Appendix No. 17, in such colony. An officer having selected the country in which he desires to draw his leave allowances is permitted to change only once during any period of leave.\n\n942. Payment out of India.\u2014An officer proceeding on Furlough or Special leave out of India cannot draw his leave allowances at the Home or any Colonial treasury unless he is provided with a Last-pay certificate or warrant in accordance with the rules laid down in Chapter XLII.\n\n943. (a) Privilege leave allowances are not payable out of India; but in case an officer leaving India should afterwards want his leave to be commuted, he should take with him a privilege leave certificate.\n\n945. Rate of Exchange.\u2014Except as provided in Articles 946 and 947, when payment is made at the Home Treasury, rupees are converted into sterling at the rate of exchange fixed for the time being, for the adjustment of financial transactions between the Imperial and the Indian treasuries. Unless otherwise arranged, this rate of exchange is also applied in the payment of leave allowances in a Colony. If any payments are made at a different rate, or otherwise erroneously, they should be adjusted in subsequent payments.\n\nExceptions.\u2014The officers whose names are mentioned in Appendix No. 30 (not given in this abstract) have been specially authorised by the Secretary of State to receive leave allowances, while on leave out of India, at the rate of exchange of 2 shillings to the rupee.\n\n946. If, in any covenant or contract, dated before the 23rd day of November, 1871, with any officer for service in India, it is provided that, in payments to be made under, or in pursuance of, the contract, a pound sterling shall be considered an equivalent or equal to, and calculated after the rate of ten rupees, any leave allowance which the officer is, under his covenant or contract, entitled to receive in England, shall be converted into sterling at that rate. But if, in such contract, no provision is made for the payment of any allowances during leave, the aforesaid rate of exchange will not apply to any leave allowances.\n\n947. The absentee allowance of a Military officer on Furlough out of India and drawn in England, who elected the Military Furlough Rules of 1868 before the 1st July, 1871, is paid at the rate of two shillings the Government rupee, but this exception does not apply to a Military Officer in Civil employ subject to the Military Furlough Regulations of 1868 on Special leave under Article 348. The absentee allowance of such an officer if drawn in England is paid at the official rate of exchange for the time being.\n\n8. Method of Payment in England.\u2014Payment is made at the Home Treasury\u2014\n\n(a) In respect of civil officers, on or after January 1st, April 1st, July 1st, and October 1st, for the quarters ending respectively on December 31st, March 31st, June 30th, and September 30th.\n\n(b) And in respect of military officers, on or after February 1st, May 1st, August 1st, and November 1st for the quarters ending respectively on January 31st, April 30th, July 31st, and October 31st\u2014\n\n(i) to the officer on his personal application; or\n\n(ii) to his banker or other agent, duly authorised under power-of-attorney, on production of a life certificate, filled up and executed in the manner directed thereon (except in cases where proof of existence is not required owing to the banker having guaranteed the Secretary of State against loss consequent on his dispensing with the production of such proof); or\n\n(iii) on presentation of a draft, duly filled up and signed by the officer, in a form which, with the requisite form of life certificate attached, may be obtained from the India Office, London, on the officer's written application.\n\n949. (a) If not drawn in England.\u2014(a) If an officer proceeding on Long Leave to Europe does not intend to draw allowances from the Home Treasury during his absence, he must nevertheless take with him a Certificate of Leave in the following form, from the Audit Officer in whose circle of audit his appointment is held. If the officer visits England, this certificate is to be presented at the India Office:\n\nCERTIFICATE OF LEAVE GRANTED TO (name of and designation of office held by, the officer) PROCEEDING OUT OF INDIA.\n\nNOTE.\u2014[The allowances admissible to the officer during leave will be paid in India.]\n\n1.\u2014Government under which employed.\n\n2.\u2014Date of beginning and ending of any leave already taken; the nature of such leave, and the rule under which it was taken.\n\n3.\u2014Article of the Civil Service Regulations under which the leave is granted.\n\nNOTE.\u2014[Distinguish Furlough granted on medical certificate from Furlough granted without medical certificate.]\n\n4.\u2014Period of leave.\n\n5.\u2014Date of commencement of leave.\n\n6.\u2014Monthly rate of absentee allowance.\n\n7.\u2014Source from which absentee allowance is payable.\n\n8.\u2014Period for, and terms on, which leave may be extended or commuted otherwise than to Extraordinary leave.\n\n(Signature)\n\nAudit Office.\n\n1. A Military Officer subject to the Military Leave Rules proceeding on Furlough cannot obtain the certificate in this Article until he submits to the Audit Officer a certificate in form No. 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, as the case may be\u2014\n\n(i) In the case of an officer of the Bengal Army, by the Secretary to the Government of India in the Military Department; and\n\n(ii) In the case of an officer of the Madras or Bombay Army, by the Adjutant-General of the Army to which he belongs.\n\n(b) If the officer afterwards desire to draw his leave allowances at the Home Treasury of the Government of India or at some Colonial treasury, he must obtain a last pay certificate from the Audit Officer in whose Circle of Audit he was employed when he proceeded on leave.\n\n950. An officer proceeding on Long Leave to a Colony in America or the West Indies must take with him \"certificate of leave granted\" in the form referred to in Article 949 (a); if the officer visit England and has occasion to apply for an extension of leave, the certificate should be presented at the India Office. If not previously presented, it must be forwarded to the India Office when permission to return to duty is applied for.\nCHAPTER XLII.\n\nLAST-PAY CERTIFICATES.\n\n951. Except as provided in Article 956, no officer can begin to draw his leave allowances at any treasury in India, or at the Home Treasury of the Government of India, without producing a last-pay certificate from the treasury where his pay or allowances were last disbursed or from the Accountant General within whose jurisdiction this treasury is.\n\n964. An officer proceeding to Europe should present his last-pay certificate at the India Office in London. When he returns to India, he should obtain a last-pay certificate from the India Office.\n\nPART X.\u2014PROCEDURE RELATING TO PENSIONS.\n\nCHAPTER XLIII.\n\nAPPLICATIONS FOR AND GRANTS OF PENSIONS.\n\n986. The rules in this chapter apply to all officers applying for pension under these regulations, except\u2014\n(a) Covenanted Civil Servants\u2014vide Chapter XLV.\n(b) Chaplains\u2014vide Chapter XLVI.\n(c) Judges of the High Courts, for whom no special procedure is laid down.\n\n987. There is no limitation on the period after retirement within which an application for pension or gratuity must be submitted; but apart from special orders, a pension applied for after the officer has retired begins from the date of application. (See also Article 1013.) An officer may be admitted to pension while absent on leave, whether in or out of India.\n\n992. If an officer in superior service, whose age is less than sixty years, is required to retire under Article 508 (a), the head of this office must certify in the column for \"Any other remarks,\" on the third page of the application for his pension, the cause of the applicant's inefficiency, and quote the order of the Local Government sanctioning the applicant's retirement as superannuated. If the officer wishes to retire of his own accord under Article 508, the fact should be stated.\n\n995. (a) The Government of India is ordinarily unwilling to pass orders on questions affecting the pension of an officer until he actually retires, because their premature discussion occupies valuable time almost always to no purpose, and uselessly.\n\n1003. Power of Revision.\u2014Should the amount granted to an officer be found to be in excess of that to which the Government of India in the Finance Department considers him entitled under the regulations, he will be called upon to refund such excess.\n\nCHAPTER XLIV.\n\nPAYMENTS.\n\nPlace of Payment.\n\n1015. (a) When a pension is stated in rupees, it is payable at any treasury of the Government of India in India; or,\n\n(b) If the pensioner is resident elsewhere than in Asia, at his option, at the Home Treasury of the Government of India.\n\n1015a. All pensions granted in rupees, which are payable at the Home Treasury to residents in the United Kingdom, or which are payable to residents in any other country in which the standard of currency is gold, are paid, with effect from the 1st April, 1890, at the rate of exchange annually fixed for the adjustment of transactions between the British and Indian Governments, subject to the condition that the rate of 1s. 9d. the rupee is fixed as the minimum rate at which the conversion into sterling shall be effected.\n\nNOTE 1.\u2014[The same rate of exchange is adopted in issuing gratuities to persons residing in a country in which gold is the standard of currency. But when the service of an officer to whom a gratuity is granted terminates in India, the gratuity should be paid in India.\n\nNOTE 2.\u2014A pensioner who has been resident in a country in which the standard of currency is gold, ceases to be entitled to draw his pension at the minimum rate of 1s. 9d. the rupee after a continuous absence of six months. After such absence he shall be held to be no longer resident therein, unless he shall adduce satisfactory evidence of continued residence to the Secretary of State. Failing such evidence all pension accruing after the first six months of absence will be converted at the rate of exchange annually fixed for transactions with the British Government.]\n\n1016 Covenanted rate of Exchange.\u2014The rule for the payment at the Home treasury of a pension at the rate of exchange fixed yearly for the adjustment of financial transactions between the Imperial and Indian Governments applies to an officer under covenant who is entitled by his covenant to pension; the covenanted rate of exchange for his pay and allowances does not, unless it is expressly so stated, apply to his pension.\n\n1017. Transfers between England and India.\u2014(a) Transfer of a pension from the Home Treasury to an Indian treasury is permitted whenever desired\n(b) Transfer of a pension from an Indian to the Home Treasury is permitted only once.\n\nProcedure in paying.\n\n1021. A gratuity is paid in a single sum, and not by instalments.\n\n1025. A pension is payable in India monthly on and after the first day of the following month.\n\n1049. At the Home Treasury pensions are payable quarterly.\n\nPayment in a Colony.\n\n1051. The rules in this section apply to pensions granted under the rules in any Chapter of these regulations:\n\n1052. The pension of a pensioner residing in any Colony named in Appendix No. 17 may be paid there.\n\n1057. Rate of Exchange.\u2014Pensions stated in Indian money shall, where the standard of currency of the colony is gold, except when it is otherwise arranged, be paid in sterling money at the rate of exchange annually fixed for the adjustment of transactions between the British and Indian Governments, subject to the condition that the rate of 1s. 9d. the rupee is fixed, with effect from the 1st April, 1890, as the minimum rate at which the conversion into sterling shall be effected. If any payments are made at a different rate or otherwise erroneously, they should be adjusted in subsequent payments.\n\nNOTE.\u2014[See Notes to Article 1015a above.]\n\n1058. Transfer of Payment.\u2014In case a pensioner desires transfer of payment of his pension from one colony to another, the Government of India will recognise the proceedings of the Colonial Authorities sanctioning such transfer, which should, however, be reported separately by the pensioner to the Government of India and to the Under-Secretary of State for India.\n\n1059. Upon his return to India an officer should deliver up his duplicate Warrant, which will serve the purpose of a last-pay certificate.\nCHAPTER XLV.\n\nCovenanted Civil Servants.\n\nApplications.\n\n1062. The rules in this Section apply to all members of the Covenanted Civil Service, including Statutory Native Civil Servants.\n\n1066. During leave to Europe.\u2014(a) A Covenanted Civil Servant, who wishes to retire from the service while on leave in Europe, must submit his application to the Secretary of State.\n\n(b) When an officer makes his application under this Article, whether after completing his full period of service, or after having been declared by the Medical Board to be unfit for further service in India, his resignation is accepted, subject to the adjustment of any demands that may be standing against him in India; and he is directed to apply to the Government of India, the Government of Madras, or the Government of Bombay, as the case may be, for the annuity or gratuity to which his length of service may entitle him.\n\nCommencement of Annuities.\n\n1068. The annuity of an officer who leaves India by sea, when retiring from the service at the end of subsidiary leave, begins, and his subsidiary leave ends, on the day of the departure of the vessel in which he sails.\n\nNote.\u2014[As soon as an officer gives over charge of his office the Accountant General should furnish the following information to the Government of India in the Finance Department, if the officer is a Member of the Bengal Civil Service, and to the Government of Madras or Bombay, if the officer is a Member of the Madras or Bombay Civil Service:\u2014\n(i) Name of officer.\n(ii) Date on which he made over charge of his office.\n(iii) The amount of subsidiary leave granted, if any.\n(iv) Date up to (and including) which subsidiary leave allowances have been drawn.\n(v) What demands, if any, are outstanding against the officer.\n\n1069. The annuity of a Member of Council who has not previously resigned his seat in Council, or whose successor has not entered upon his office, commences from the day following that on which the vessel in which he leaves India sails, or from the expiry of his five years' tenure of office, whichever date is earlier.\n\nManner of Payment.\n\n1071. Annuities are payable in arrear, quarterly, and to date of decease.\n\n1072. (a) Payment of annuities and gratuities may be taken at the Home Treasury in sterling money, or in India in Government rupees, at the following rate:\u2014\n(i) If the annuitant was a member of the Bengal Civil Service,\u201410\u00bd Government rupees for each pound sterling.\n(ii) If the annuitant was a member of the Madras or Bombay Civil Service,\u201410\u00b765 Government rupees for each pound sterling.\n\nNote.\u2014[The reasons for the difference in the rates of exchange are to be found in the history of the Annuity Funds. The rates of exchange differ considerably in the various Service Funds.]\n\n(b) Provided that any annuitant, who is a permanent resident in India, may, if he wishes to draw his annuity in that country, exercise the option of receiving it at the rate of exchange annually fixed for the adjustment of transactions between the British and Indian Exchequers.\n\nNote.\u2014[This rule applies to all officers whose pensions are stated in sterling, and who, being resident in Asia, take payment in India.]\n\nTransfer of Payment.\n\n1073. Transfer from the Home Treasury to an Indian treasury, and vice versa, is permitted twice only.\n\nPayment in a Colony.\n\n1076. Payment of annuities may be made in any of the Colonies named in Appendix No. 17 in accordance with the procedure laid down in Chapter XLIV., Articles 1051 to 1061.\n\nCHAPTER XLVI.\n\nChaplains.\n\n1077. Applications may be made to, and pensions are granted either by the Government of India, the Government of Bombay, or the Government of Madras (as the case may be), or by the Secretary of State.\n\n1. At least six months before a Chaplain, whether of the Church of England or the Church of Scotland, completes his full period of service, a statement should be furnished by the Local Government concerned to the Government of India in the Home Department, for transmission to the Secretary of State, showing the date on which the Chaplain completes such service, whether he is in England or in India. It should also be stated whether he is on duty or on leave, and if the latter, for what period.\n\n1078. Applications in England.\u2014(a) A Chaplain proceeding to England on retirement without applying for pension to the Government of India, the Government of Bombay, or the Government of Madras (as the case may be), should procure a certificate:\u2014\n\n(i) If he is a Chaplain of the Bengal Establishment, or a Chaplain of the Church of Scotland serving in the Bengal Presidency;\u2014from the Comptroller-General;\n\n(ii) If he is a Chaplain on the Bombay or the Madras Establishment, or a Chaplain of the Church of Scotland serving in Madras or Bombay;\u2014from the Accountant-General at Bombay or Madras (as the case may be);\n\nshowing his service, residence, the amount of pension to which he is entitled, and the date from which his pension may be paid.\n\n1079. Applications in India.\u2014A Chaplain belonging to the Bengal Ecclesiastical Establishment who wishes to obtain pension from the Authorities in India, must submit his application to the Government of India in the Home Department, through the Archdeacon or Bishop of his Diocese.\n\n1080. A Chaplain belonging to the Madras or Bombay Ecclesiastical Establishment, must submit his application to the Government of Madras or the Government of Bombay, as the case may be, through the Archdeacon or the Bishop of his Diocese.\n\n1081. A Chaplain of the Church of Scotland serving in the Bengal Presidency, who wishes to obtain pension from the Authorities in India, must submit his application to the Government of India in the Home Department, if he is not Senior Chaplain through the Senior Chaplain of the Church of Scotland.\n\n1082. A Chaplain of the Church of Scotland serving in Madras or Bombay must submit his application to the Government of Madras or Bombay, as the case may be, if he is not Senior Chaplain, through the Senior Chaplain of his Presidency.\n\n1083. The Home Department, before accepting the resignation of a Chaplain on the Bengal Establishment, or a Chaplain of the Church of Scotland serving in the Bengal Presidency, should obtain a certificate from the Comptroller-General, showing the Chaplain's service, residence, and the amount of pension to which he is entitled. The Government of Madras or Bombay, as the case may be, should obtain a like certificate from the Accountant-General of the Presidency concerned.\n\n1084. Grant of Pension in India.\u2014(a) In the case of the Bengal Presidency if the Chaplain's resignation is accepted, the case should be forwarded to the Finance Department of the Government of India, in which department a Resolution will be recorded granting the pension to which the Chaplain may be entitled.\n\n(b) In the case of the Madras or Bombay Presidency the procedure is the same, but the Resolution is issued by Madras or Bombay, as the case may be.\n\n1085. Last-pay Certificate.\u2014A Chaplain to whom pension has been granted in India should be careful before proceeding to England to obtain the usual certificate of the last issue of pay or pension to him in India.\nEXTRACT FROM CHAPTER I.\n\nREGULATIONS RELATING TO TRAVELLING ALLOWANCES ON JOINING FIRST APPOINTMENT OF CERTAIN OFFICERS APPOINTED IN EUROPE.\n\n1195. The rules regarding\u2014\n(a) passage to India and outfit allowances (in case of appointment in Europe).\n(b) return to Europe (on termination of appointment), of certain high officers, which have been framed by Her Majesty's Secretary of State for India, are given in Appendix No. 3.\n\n1196. Officers appointed in Europe to the Telegraph, Public Works, Forest, and Educational Departments, to the Geological Survey of India, and to the Bengal Pilot Service, are ordinarily allowed by the Secretary of State a free passage to India.\n\n1197. Chaplains also are ordinarily allowed a free passage to India, and in the contracts now entered into by them they engage to refund the cost of their passage to India, in the event of their resigning their appointments within three years after the date of their arrival in India on grounds other than ill-health under a Medical certificate.\n\n1198. An officer appointed to the Bengal Pilot Service is granted an Outfit Allowance of \u00a320.\n\n1199. An officer appointed in Europe to the Geological Survey of India is also granted an Outfit Allowance of \u00a340.\n\n1200. An Officer, who is appointed by the Secretary of State, while resident in Europe, and who is not one of the high officers mentioned in Article 1195, is entitled to Travelling Allowance at the rates laid down in Chapter XLVIII. from the capital town of the Presidency to which he is attached, to the first station to which he is posted.\n\n1201. (a) If such an officer disembarks in India at any port other than the capital town of the Presidency to which he is attached, he is entitled to Travelling Allowance from such port to the first station to which he is posted, limited to the amount to which he would have been entitled under the preceding Article if he had disembarked at such capital town.\n\n(b) But if an officer is directed by the Secretary of State to proceed to a particular port, he is entitled to Travelling Allowance from that port.\n\n1202. For the purposes of the preceding Articles an officer attached to any Province or Presidency, other than Bombay or Madras, is held to be attached to the Bengal Presidency.\n\nAPPENDIX No. 17.\n\nReferred to in Articles 93 and 1052.\n\nLIST OF COLONIAL TREASURERS, DISTRICT PAYMASTERS, AND OTHER IMPERIAL AGENTS IN THE COLONIES.\n\n| Station                                      | Designation of Agent                                      |\n|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| Bahamas                                      | The Acting District Paymaster                             |\n| Barbados (including British Guiana, Trinidad, &c.) | The District Paymaster                                   |\n| Bermuda                                      | The District Paymaster                                   |\n| British Columbia                             | The Naval Store-keeper, Esquimalt Yard (British Columbia). |\n| Canada, East, Montreal District              | The District Paymaster, Halifax, Nova Scotia.             |\n| Canada, West, London and Ottawa Districts    | The Staff Officer of Pensioners, Toronto, Canada West;

Except as declared in these Rules, Government will make no arrangements for, and will defray none of the expenses connected with the conveyance or passage of a Governor-General, his family, or suite, to or from India.\n\n3. A newly appointed Governor General proceeding to India from Europe to enter upon his office may be accompanied by three combatant military officers for his personal staff, the expenses of whose passage will be defrayed by Government according to the rules in force in the Military Department as to military officers proceeding to India on duty.\n\n4. For an ex-Governor General returning to Europe, on resignation, a steamer belonging to the Indian Marine Service will (if consistent with the requirements of the public service) be gratuitously provided, to convey him and his family and suite to Suez; but the homeward voyage of the ship thus provided shall not be continued beyond Suez. The ex-Governor General will bear the cost of entertainment and messing incurred while on board, in respect of himself and his party, according to the rules in force relating to the conveyance of passengers in Indian Marine troopships.\n\n5.

In the event of a Governor General dying and leaving a widow in India, a steamer belonging to the Indian Marine Service will (if consistent with the requirements of the public service) be provided to convey her to Suez in like manner as in the case of an ex-Governor General. The widow of a deceased Governor General so returning to Europe may be accompanied by one officer of the personal staff on the conditions mentioned in the preceding rule, and shall bear all such expenses as would, in ordinary course, be borne by an ex-Governor General returning to Europe.\n\nII.\n\n8. The allowances for equipment and voyage of the Governors of Madras and Bombay, the Commanders-in-Chief of the Forces in India, of Madras, and of Bombay, if resident in Europe at the time of appointment respectively, are fixed as follows:\n\n| Position                                      | Allowance (\u00a3) |\n|-----------------------------------------------|--------------|\n| The Governor of Madras                        | 1,000        |\n| The Governor of Bombay                        | 1,000        |\n| The Commander-in-Chief of the Forces in India | 500          |\n| The Commander-in-Chief, Madras                | 500          |\n| The Commander-in-Chief, Bombay                | 500          |\n\n9.

For the purposes of defraying the expenses of equipment and voyage from Europe on first appointment there shall be allowed\u2014\n\nTo a Chief Justice or Judge of any High Court \u00a3300\n\nBut no such allowance shall be made to any person who, being in India, is appointed to the office of Chief Justice or Judge, or who, having been in India, is in Europe at the time of his appointment with the intention of returning to India.\nREGULATIONS FOR ADMISSION TO THE INDIAN STAFF CORPS.*\n\n1. A certain number of appointments to the Indian Staff Corps will be offered to candidates for admission to the Royal Military College at each Further Examination, and to officers of the Militia (not over 23 years of age) at each Competitive Examination.\n\n2. All Queen's cadets (British and Indian) and Honorary Queen's cadets nominated by the Secretary of State for India in Council will have the option of electing whether they will join the Royal Military College for appointment to the Staff Corps, or for Commissions in British Cavalry or Infantry. The appointments in the Staff Corps remaining after the claims of the Queen's Cadets and Honorary Queen's Cadets (Indian) have been satisfied will be allotted in order of merit to successful candidates who have elected for the Indian Staff Corps at the Sandhurst Further and Militia Competitive Examinations.\n\n3. Election shall be final, and no candidate for the Staff Corps will thereafter be eligible for transfer to the Cavalry or Infantry of the Line except by exchange.\n\n4. After the final examination at the Royal Military College, and in the case of Militia candidates after the Competitive Examination, a successful candidate will be gazetted as Second Lieutenant on the unattached List of the British Army, and will be provided with passage to India. He will be required to embark within two months of being gazetted. From the date of first commission to the date of arrival in India he will receive the British pay of his rank.\n\n5.

I.,\n\nWhereas it has been represented to Us that it is expedient to amend the Regulations for governing the Promotion in the Army of the Officers of Our Indian Forces, and their transfer to the Unemployed Supernumerary List, Our will and pleasure is, that, with effect from the 1st January, 1891, the following Regulations be established, and be the sole Regulations for these purposes viz.:\n\n1. A Lieutenant-Colonel may attain the rank of Colonel\u2014\n   (a) By twelve years' service in the substantive grade of Lieutenant-Colonel in the \"local service.\"\n   (b) On being selected for the rank of Colonel under such regulations as our Secretary of State for India in Council may lay down; provided he shall have completed three years' satisfactory service as a Lieutenant-Colonel.\n   (c) By brevet, on appointment to be one of Our Aides-de-Camp.\n   (d) By brevet, as a reward for distinguished service in the field.\n   (e) By brevet, for distinguished service of an exceptional nature other than in the field.\n\n2. If it shall be necessary to appoint an Officer to a situation which may be declared by Our Secretary of State for India in Council to be one which shall carry the rank of Colonel, although the Officer may not have the rank or service to qualify for promotion, the local and temporary rank of Colonel only shall, until he shall have completed the necessary qualifying service, be conferred on him while holding such appointment.\n\n3. The rank of Brigadier-General shall be local or temporary only.\n\n4. The names of General Officers shall be borne upon four separate lists. The first shall contain the names of\n\n* This does not refer to the special rates of half-pay of unemployed General Officers who are effective officers.\n\u2020 Subscription for this pension is voluntary.\nthose on the active list, and of those who, having been promoted out of their regular turn shall be supernumerary; the second, the names of Officers retired under Our Royal Warrant of the 31st December, 1877; the third, the names of Officers placed on the unemployed supernumerary list under Our Royal Warrant of the 24th October, 1881; and the fourth the names of those who shall have retired from the service.\n\n5. There shall be no establishment of General Officers, and after the number of General Officers has been reduced, and the names of the Staff Corps Officers removed from the list of the Indian Army, as provided in Articles 6 and 7, there shall be no more than one General. Subject to this limitation, a Lieutenant-General of the Indian Army shall be promoted to the rank of General when the Lieutenant-General of the Staff Corps next below him in seniority as Lieutenant-General is promoted to the rank of General in ordinary course, or, if there be already a General of the Indian Army, so soon thereafter as a casualty may occur. The maximum number (not to be exceeded except during a period of war) of Lieutenant-Generals shall be three, and that of Major-Generals shall be thirteen, and promotion to those grades shall be made under such regulations as Our Secretary of State for India in Council may lay down.\n\n6. The names of the Colonels and General Officers of the Staff Corps now borne on the Indian List to regulate promotion shall remain on that list (to be thereon retained in italics, until their death, retirement, or transfer to the unemployed supernumerary list, for the purpose of regulating the promotion of the Officers below them), until the number of General Officers has been reduced as provided in Article 7. The names of the Generals and Lieutenant-Generals shall be removed when the number of Lieutenant-Generals has been reduced, and the names of the Major-Generals and Colonels when the number of Major-Generals has been reduced.\n\n7. After the 31st December, 1890, the number of General Officers on the active list shall be gradually reduced as follows:\n\n(a) Officers who were on the establishment of General Officers on the 31st December, 1886, shall be promoted to vacancies in the rank of Lieutenant-General as casualties occur.\n\n(b) As vacancies occur in the rank of Major-General, the second vacancy in every two shall be absorbed; and where there are no more Officers qualified under (a) for promotion to the rank of Lieutenant-General, the third vacancy of every three in that rank shall also be absorbed. The remaining vacancies shall be filled until the number of Lieutenant-Generals of the Indian Army is reduced to three, and that of Major-Generals to thirteen.\n\n8. Subject to the above reduction, every vacancy in the rank of Major-General shall be filled by the promotion of the senior Colonel of the Indian Army; or by the moving up of the name of the senior Officer of the Staff Corps borne on the list to regulate promotion; or by the absorption of a General Officer promoted for distinguished service. Every vacancy in the rank of Lieutenant-General or in that of General shall be filled up in like manner by the promotion of the Senior Officer of the Indian Army in the grade next below, or by the moving up of the name of the Senior Officer of the Staff Corps borne on the list of that grade.\n\n9. Temporary or local rank and command as Major-General, Lieutenant-General, or General may, for the convenience of Our Service, be conferred on an Officer of the next lower rank (whether he hold such rank permanently or temporarily), without regard to seniority.\n\n10. A Colonel who shall vacate an appointment as temporary Major-General, may upon the recommendation of Our Governor General in Council, be made an honorary Major-General.\n\n11. Promotion may be conferred upon a Colonel, Major-General, or Lieutenant-General, without regard to vacancies, for distinguished service in the field, or of an exceptional nature other than in the field, and in such case the recommendation of Our Governor General in Council, detailing the services for which the Officer is promoted, shall be published in the General Orders of Our Indian Military Forces, and in the London Gazette.\n\n12. Field Marshals shall be appointed at the will of the Sovereign, and the rank shall be conferred without reference to seniority. A General Officer, retired under Our Warrant of the 31st December, 1877, or placed on the unemployed supernumerary list under Our Warrant of the 24th October, 1881, shall remain eligible for promotion to the rank of Field Marshal.\n\n13. A Major-General or Lieutenant-General, on the unemployed supernumerary list, who was promoted to the former rank not later than the 31st December, 1886, shall be promoted to higher rank when the Officer next Junior to him on the effective list is so promoted.\n\n14.

The Regulations under which, with the view of securing the flow of promotion in Our Corps of Royal Engineers, Officers of the Corps may be placed on half pay or retired, shall not be held to disqualify the Officers on the Indian Establishment so affected from continuing to hold any appointments in the Civil Departments of the Government of India which they may have been holding previously, and, subject to the discretion of the Government of India, their tenure of such appointments shall be regulated by the rules which apply to other persons holding similar appointments in the same Departments.\n\n9.

If any Candidate is found to be deficient in any particular subject, this shall be stated, in order that he may receive special instruction on the point at Netley.\n\n9. After passing this examination, the successful candidates will be required to attend one Course at entire course of practical instruction at the Army Medical School as Surgeons on probation in\u2014Netley.\n\n(1) Hygiene.\n(2) Clinical and Military Medicine.\n(3) Clinical and Military Surgery.\n(4) Pathology of diseases and injuries incident to Military Service.\n\nThese courses are to be of not less than four months' duration; but candidates who have already gone through a course at Netley as candidates for the Army or Navy Medical Service may, if thought desirable, be exempted from attending the school a second time.\n\n10.

No Medical Officer, however employed, can receive any staff allowance in addition to the pay laid down in para. 16 unless he has passed the examination in Hindustani known as the \"Lower standard.\" The passing of this examination does not of itself bring any increase of pay to an Officer, unless appointed to a substantive or officiating charge; but failure to pass disqualifies an Officer, even when holding such substantive or officiating charge, from receiving any portion of the staff allowances of the appointment.\n\n24. Surgeon Major-Generals and Surgeon-Colonels on vacating office at the expiration of the five years' tour of duty, will be permitted to draw in India respectively an unemployed salary of Rs. 1,200 per mensum in the former, and Rs. 900 in the latter case, for a period of six months from the date of their vacating office, after which they will be placed while unemployed on the following scale of pay per diem:\n\n| Surgeon Major-General. | Surgeon-Colonel. |\n|-----------------------|------------------|\n| After 30 years service on full pay | \u00a3 2 5 0 | \u00a3 1 14 0 |\n| \" 25 \" \" \" \" \" \" | \u00a3 2 5 0 | \u00a3 1 10 0 |\n| \" 20 \" \" \" \" \" \" | \u00a3 2 0 0 | \u00a3 1 8 0 |\n\nLeave Rules.\n\n25.

An officer, unable on account of the state of his health to return to duty within the maximum period of two years' absence will, unless he is under para. 25 specially granted an extension of leave without pay, be placed on temporary half pay or the retired list, as the circumstances of the case may require. An officer will also be liable to be placed on half pay or the retired list should his health require an undue amount of leave, whether in or out of India.\n\n28.

A Surgeon-Major-General, after five years' active employment in India in that grade, will be entitled to retire upon a pension of \u00a3350 per annum, in addition to that which he may be entitled under the above scale.\n\n36. A Surgeon-Colonel will, after five years' active employment in India in that appointment be entitled to retire upon a pension of \u00a3250 per annum, in addition to the pension to which he may be entitled under the above scale.\n\n37. In each of the above cases stated in paras. 34 and 35, six months' absence on medical certificate will be allowed to count towards actual service in those grades. (See para. 29).\n\n38. A Surgeon-Major-General or Surgeon-Colonel who has completed his term of service and has reverted to British pay, may reside in Europe, at the same time qualifying for higher pension.\n\n39. With a view to maintain the efficiency of the service, all Medical Officers of the rank of Brigade Surgeon Lieut.-Col., Surgeon-Lieut.-Col. and Surgeon-Major shall be placed on the Retired List when they shall have attained the age of fifty-five years, and all Surgeons-General and Deputy Surgeons-General when they shall have attained the age of sixty years. In any special case, where it would appear to be for the good of the service that the Officer should continue in employment, he may be so continued, subject in each case to the sanction of the Secretary of State for India in Council.\n\n40. Medical Officers not entitled to pension, when placed on temporary or permanent half-pay under para. 26, will be granted the British rate of half-pay of the corresponding military rank as under:\n\n| Rank                  | Rates of Half-pay |\n|-----------------------|-------------------|\n|                       | Per Diem. | Per Annum. |\n| Brigade Surgeon Lieut.-Col. | \u00a3 s. d. | \u00a3 s. d. |\n| Surgeon Lieut.-Col.    | 11 0      | 200 15 0   |\n| Surgeon Major          | 9 6       | 173 7 6    |\n| Surgeon Captain        | 7 0       | 127 15 0   |\n| Surgeon Lieutenant     | 3 0       | 54 15 0    |\n\nOfficers cannot retire in India on half-pay (No. 54, 28th February 1865).\n\n41. The period passed on half-pay will in no case be reckoned as service in calculating claims for promotion or to pension on retirement.\n\n42. Officers hereafter admitted to the Indian Medical Service will, after retirement on pension, be liable to recall to military duty in case of any great emergency arising, up to limits of age laid down by the Government of India.\n\nWound Pensions.\n\n43. Medical Officers are entitled to the same allowances on account of wounds and injuries received in action as are granted to combatant Officers of Her Majesty's Indian Military Forces holding the corresponding military rank.\n\nNote referred to on previous page: Substantive and Officiating Charges:\n\nMedical charges are of two kinds\u2014substantive and officiating. The first is held by an Officer as his fixed and permanent appointment. For this he is entitled to the monthly consolidated pay laid down in the above scale (para. 18), subject to the condition specified in para. 22.\n\nAn officiating charge is held by an Officer who is acting temporarily in an appointment during the absence of the Officer whose substantive charge it is. The Officer thus officiating receives not the consolidated pay of the appointment laid down in the scale (para. 18), but the Indian pay and allowances (para. 16) of his own grade, plus half the staff allowance of the appointment in which he is officiating (plus half the staff pay of his own appointment, if he have one).\n\nAn Officer's staff allowance is the difference between his \"Indian pay and allowances\" (para. 16) and \"consolidated pay\" (para. 18) as given in the scales. The staff pay of an appointment is the difference between the Indian pay and allowances and the consolidated pay of the permanent incumbent. It has been ruled, however, that the extra allowance for an officiating charge shall never be less than Rs 100 per mensem.\n\nExample 1. A Medical Officer of less than 5 years' service officiates for one in charge of a regiment of the same period of service. He receives Rs. 286. 10 + Rs. 100 = Rs. 386. 10.\n\nExample 2. A Medical Officer of less than 5 years' service, officiating for a Surgeon-Captain of 6 years' service in charge of a regiment, receives Rs. 286. 10 + Rs. 600 \u2014 Rs. 392. 5. 2 = Rs. 390 7. 5.\n\nExample 3. A Surgeon-Captain of 5 years' service holding permanent medical charge of a regiment, and officiating for a Surgeon-Major absent from his regiment, receives Rs. 304. 14. 2. + Rs. 800 \u2014 677. 6. 11. + Rs. 600 \u2014 304. 14. 2. = Rs. 513. 11. 7.\nFAMILY PENSIONS.\n\n44. The claims to pension of widows and families of Medical Officers shall be treated under the provisions of such Royal Warrant regulating the grant of pensions to the widows and families of British Officers as may be in force at the time being. (The Royal Warrant of 15th Nov., 1887, is the one now in force.)\n\n45. The widows and families of Medical Officers are also entitled to pensions from the Indian Military Service Family Pension Fund, to which all Surgeons must, as a condition of their appointment, subscribe from the date of their arrival in India.\n\nINDIAN NURSING SERVICE.\n\nCONDITIONS OF APPOINTMENT, &c.\n\n1. The Nursing Establishment is to consist of two grades, viz.:\n   (i) Lady Superintendents.\n   (ii) Nursing Sisters.\n\nNote.\u2014For convenience sake, the term \"lady nurse\" is used in the following paragraphs, where it is intended to include both the above grades.\n\n2. Nursing Sisters must be, at the time of appointment, over 25 and under 35 years of age and in sound bodily health. They must have had at least three years' preliminary training and service combined, in a hospital in which adult male patients receive medical and surgical treatment, and in which a staff of Nursing Sisters is maintained.\n\n3. The duration of a term of service, for both grades of lady nurses, shall be five years, capable of renewal for a further five years at the option of the Government, with the consent of the lady nurse.\n\n4. The engagement may, however, be terminated at any time on six months' notice being given, either on the part of the Government or of the lady nurse (but see para. 13).\n\nRATES OF PAY.\n\n(In addition to free quarters, fuel, light, and punkah-pullers.)\n\nRs.\n\n5. For a Lady Superintendent .......................................................... 300 per mensem.\n   For a Nursing Sister ........................................................................... 175\n\ncommencing from the date of embarkation for India.\n\nA Senior Nursing Sister, acting as Superintendent at a station where no Lady Superintendent is located, will receive an additional allowance of Rs. 25 per mensem.\n\nFAMILY REMITTANCES.\n\n6. Lady nurses are entitled to make family remittances to England through Government at the official rate of exchange, the annual limits of such remittances being \u00a3100 for Lady Superintendents and \u00a370 for Nursing Sisters.\n\nLEAVE IN INDIA.\n\n7. Leave on medical certificate, up to a maximum of six months during the whole of the five years' term of service, may be granted to a Lady Nurse by the Principal Medical Officer, H.M. Forces; during such leave she will receive two-thirds of the salary of her grade. Short leave and privilege leave may be granted at the discretion of the local authorities and as circumstances may admit.\n\nLEAVE OUT OF INDIA.\n\n8. After engagement for a second (five years') term of service, a lady nurse may be granted one year's leave from duty, on two-thirds pay, with free passage by sea and rail from and to her station. Such period will not reckon as service in any way.\n\nGRATUITIES.\n\n9. The following rates of gratuities will be payable to lady nurses on completion of their total Indian Service:\n\n| Lady Superintendents | Nursing Sisters |\n|----------------------|----------------|\n| For a completed term of five years | Rs. 1,200 | Rs. 500 |\n| If compelled by sickness to leave India before completion of a five years' term, for each completed year's service | Rs. 4,000 | Rs. 1,500 |\n| If compelled by sickness to leave India after completion of a first term of five years' service, but before completion of a second, for each completed year of the second five years' term | Rs. 200 | Rs. 75 |\n| in addition to the gratuity for the completed term of five years, as shown above. | Rs. 240 | Rs. 100 |\n\n10. No gratuity will be given for service terminated by any other cause than sickness or the completion of the terms of five and ten years' service.\n\nPASSAGE, &c.\n\n11. Passage at the public expense, subject to a deduction of 2s. a day for messing while on board ship, will be granted to lady nurses when proceeding to India on appointment, when returning home on leave (under paragraph 7), on completion of a term of service, or if invalided home before the completion of a term. They will be entitled to carry 6 cwt. of baggage. Lady nurses will also be entitled to travelling expenses by rail on the above occasions from their places of residence in England to port of embarkation, and from port of disembarkation in India to destination in that country, and vice versa.\n\n12. An outfit allowance on first appointment will be made at the rate of \u00a325 for each Lady Superintendent, and \u00a315 for each Nursing Sister.\n\n13. A lady nurse who resigns, except on account of ill-health, with less than five years' Indian service, will forthwith refund the sum of \u00a330 (on account of her passage out), and will not be entitled to a passage home.\n\n14. Lady nurses must be prepared to embark, if necessary, not later than 30 days from date of appointment.\nMILITARY FURLough REGULATIONS OF 1854.\n\nWith the view of adapting the regulations to the present increased facilities of communication, and to correct, as far as possible, any tendency in them to deter officers from resorting to the places which may be most conducive to the restoration of their health, when a change of climate is required for that purpose, the following rules are established, and are to have effect from the 1st February, 1854:\n\n1. All regimental officers in the service on the 1st February, 1854, who prefer retaining what may be considered the advantages of the old regulations, may do so, provided they signify their wish to that effect when they next apply for furlough or leave of absence, without any limitation whether such leave be in India or elsewhere; and officers who once make their election will not be entitled to any other choice, but will be afterwards subject to the new or old regulations, according to their decisions.\n\n2. Staff officers, as such, have not the above option allowed them, but they may retain the advantages of the old regulations by giving up their appointments, which, in such cases, will be considered vacated from the date of embarkation.\n\n3. To those officers who adopt them, the new regulations will apply retrospectively in respect of furlough and leave of absence beyond sea, and in computing their time of service for retirement, so that their furloughs or leaves of absence, whether under the old or the new rules, and whether on private affairs or sick certificate, within or beyond India, will count for service to the authorized extent only, in computing the time for retirement on full pay.\n\n4. Officers who have availed themselves of the option of the old rules are allowed to reconsider the question under the modifications now sanctioned.\n\n5. Officers who have not taken leave subsequent to the publication of the new rules on the 1st February, 1854, and who, consequently, may not have been called upon to declare whether they would abide by the old or the new regulations, will, on retirement from the service, be entitled to take full advantage of the privileges given by the new regulations.\n\nFURLoughS ON PRIVATE AFFAIRS.\n\n6. Every officer will be allowed a furlough to Europe, or elsewhere beyond sea, for a period of two years at the expiration of ten years' service, and for a second period of two years after twenty years' service in India.\n\n7. The second furlough of two years will only be granted after ten years' service in India, from the date of the return to duty after the first furlough of two years. These furloughs are not to be cumulative, under any circumstances, but are limited to two years. Officers who have taken leave of absence on sick certificate to Europe, or elsewhere beyond sea, will be ineligible to a furlough on private affairs until they have served six years from their last return to duty. This rule does not apply to short leaves to sea.\n\nOfficers who take their first furlough after twenty years' service in India, may take their second furlough after an additional service of five years from the date of their first return to duty. (G.O. 16 June, 1856)\n\n8. All grants of furlough on private affairs are subject to the exigencies of the public service, and to the regulations framed for the preservation of the efficiency of each regiment; by limiting the number of absentee.\n\n9. Officers holding staff or other detached appointments, may be allowed furlough for a period of six months without losing their appointments; but, during that period, they will not be entitled to any portion of their staff salary, which will be drawn in full by the officers officiating for them.\n\nAbsence for six months under this rule does not preclude an officer from taking his furlough to Europe after ten years' service. (G.O. 16 June, 1856)\n\n10. All officers, whether staff or regimental, while on furlough on private affairs, will be entitled to \"Furlough Pay\" only.\n\nLEAVE OF ABSENCE ON SICK CERTIFICATE.\n\n11. Leave of absence on sick certificate will be granted for a term not exceeding eighteen months, whether it be to any place in Europe, or elsewhere out of India.\n\n12. Extensions of such leave may be granted, as at present, on production of medical certificates, for further periods not exceeding eighteen months in the whole.\n\n13. An officer holding a staff or other detached appointment, will be allowed to be absent on sick certificate in England, or elsewhere beyond sea, for a period of twenty months, without losing his appointment; and, during the first six months only of such absence, he will be entitled to draw half the staff salary of his appointment, the officer officiating for him drawing the remaining half salary during the first six months, and the whole salary during the remainder of the time.\n\n14. An officer's claim to half staff salary for six months, as sanctioned in the preceding rule, will not be affected by his subsequently retiring from the service in Europe or elsewhere.\n\n15. No portion of command allowance, medical staff salary, or other similar allowance, which under the old rules was inadmissible to officers absent from their corps or stations, at the Cape or elsewhere, will be allowed to absent officers under these regulations.\n\n16. All officers, whether staff or regimental, while on leave of absence on sick certificate, will be entitled for a period of six months to the same rate of Indian pay and allowances as was allowed under the old regulations, to officers proceeding to the Cape on medical certificate, and for the remaining period of their leave they will receive furlough pay only.\n\n17. If the leave on sick certificate be extended, furlough pay will be continued; but under no circumstances for a longer period than three years altogether, from the commencement of the absence.\n\nSTAFF OFFICERS.\n\n18. The term, \"staff officers,\" applies to all officers holding staff or detached appointments, military (general or regimental), political, or civil; also to general officers commanding divisions, members of the Medical Board, superintending surgeons, and others who, under the old rules, were entitled to draw half staff allowance when absent at the Cape.\n\n19. Staff officers absent on leave beyond the periods stated in Rules 9 and 13 respectively, cannot retain their appointments and allowances except on special grounds to be sanctioned by the Government of the presidency. Any such special grant of leave is to be reported at once, with the reasons for it, and to be subject to approbation.\n\n20. The privilege of retaining staff appointments during leave of absence on sick certificate, or on furlough on private affairs will not be available a second time, if the fresh leave is on sick certificate, until an officer has been three years, or, if on private affairs, until he has been six years in the discharge of the duties of his appointment, from the date of last return to it.\n\n21. This rule, however, does not apply to leaves of absence, whether on sick certificate or on private affairs in India, or for brief periods to Ceylon, the Mauritius, or other places out of India.\n\n22. Officers commanding troops of Horse Artillery and Light Field Batteries, and officers generally in employment, will be allowed leave out of India under the same rules with respect to allowance and tenure of command or office, as regulated the grant of leave to the Cape to such officers under the old regulations, except as to the duration of those advantages, the time for their\ncontinuance being subject to the provisions of the new regulations.\n\nDATE OF FURLough AND ADVANCES OF PAY.\n\n23. The period of furlough on private affairs, or leave of absence on sick certificate, is to be calculated from the date of the departure from India of the ship in which the officer proceeds.\n\n24. Advances of pay and allowances, staff and regimental, to officers proceeding on leave of absence on sick certificate, who may be entitled to them, will be made in India, for three months from date of embarkation. Payments in continuation will be made in England at the rates of exchange fixed annually for repayment of advances made on account of Her Majesty's Government. Furlough pay will continue to be issued in advance for six months when required by officers obtaining furlough on private affairs.\n\n25. The existing regulations regarding passage-money to officers are not affected by these rules.\n\n26. The certificates issued to officers who are granted furloughs on private affairs, or leave of absence on sick certificate, are to specify the time each officer has been absent on leave within Indian limits, as well as the time of his previous absence in Europe; but will not include the periods allowed for proceeding to; the presidency or port of embarkation, and to enable officers to rejoin their regiments or stations after their return to India, nor the leave of one month's absence in six months, as authorized by the regulations. The last pay certificate of all officers proceeding to England on sick certificate is to specify the rate of regimental pay and allowances and staff salary to which they would have been entitled under the old regulations if proceeding to sea on medical certificate. This information is necessary in order that no difficulty may arise in the Pay Department of the India Office in adjusting the several payments which may be due.\n\nOFFICERS OF H.M.'S SERVICE.\n\n27. Officers of Her Majesty's service in India, whether employed regimentally or in staff or detached situations, are entitled to the advantages above laid down in respect to allowances and tenure of office when on furlough or leave of absence.\n\n28. In the case of officers of Her Majesty's service on furlough or sick certificate, in England or elsewhere, who may retire or exchange into regiments not on the Indian establishment, the grant to these officers of Indian allowances will cease from the date of their retirement or exchange, if it take place before the expiration of six months from the date of quitting India.\n\nPERIODS OF ABSENCE ALLOWED TO BE COUNTED AS SERVICE FOR RETIRING PENSIONS.\n\n29. In order that all officers quitting India on furlough or sick certificate may be placed on an exact equality as regards loss of time, the period allowed by regulation for proceeding to the presidency, or to the nearest port of embarkation, as well as the time to enable officers to rejoin their corps or station after their return to India, will be considered as time counting for service for the retiring pension.\n\n30. No furlough or leave of absence, as announced in General Orders, exceeding two years in twenty years' aggregate service, three years in twenty-five years' service, and four years in thirty years' service, shall be allowed to count as service for the retiring pension; and no difference will be made in this respect between leave of absence taken in Europe or elsewhere, in or out of India, or whether the leave be on sick certificate or on private affairs.\n\n31. In the term \"Leave of Absence as announced in General Orders,\" is to be included all leave of absence, except the period allowed in Rule 29, and the ordinary indulgence of one month's leave in six months, as authorized by the existing regulations, and while, as in all cases, whether of regimental or staff officers, to be allowed to count as service for the pension. All leave to a greater extent, granted by political and other authorities, which may not hitherto have been published in General Orders, must be so announced hereafter.\n\n32. Officers to be entitled to retire on the full pay of their regimental rank (under the regulations of 1796), must have served twenty-two years in India, out of which leaves of absence for two years in the aggregate, and not more, will be allowed to count as service for the retiring pension.\n\n33. Officers to be entitled to retire on the full pay of captains and majors (under the regulations of 1835-37) must have served twenty and twenty-four years respectively; out of which time leaves of absence for two years in the aggregate and not more will be allowed to count as service.\n\n34. Officers to be entitled to retire as lieutenant-colonels must have served twenty-eight years; out of which leaves of absence for three years in the aggregate, and not more, will be allowed to count as service.\n\n35. Officers to be entitled to retire as colonels must have served thirty-two years; out of which leaves of absence for four years in the aggregate, and not more, will be allowed to count as service.\n\n36. The scale for medical officers and veterinary surgeons of privileged furlough and leave of absence as counting for the retiring pension, will be as follows*:\n\n| Years, Months | Service |\n|---------------|---------|\n| 1             | 8       |\n| 2             | 0       |\n| 3             | 0       |\n| 4             | 0       |\n| 5             | 0       |\n| 6             | 0       |\n\n37. It is to be distinctly understood, that under no circumstances whatever will an officer be permitted to retire on full pay until he has completed the full time of service above specified, whether he be in England at the close of his service or elsewhere.\n\n38. The privileged time of absence may, with the permission of the local government, be taken at any time, subject to these regulations. If, therefore, at the end of twenty years' service, of which eighteen had been passed on actual duty in India, an officer should be on furlough or sick certificate in Europe or elsewhere, he will be entitled to retire on the full pay of a captain without returning to India, and so in the other terms of service for the higher pensions. In like manner, a medical officer on furlough or sick certificate, in Europe or elsewhere, at the end of seventeen years' service, fifteen years and four months of which have been passed on actual duty in India, will be entitled to retire on the lowest rate pension, without returning to India, and so in the other terms of service for the higher pensions.\n\n39. These rules do not in any way affect the existing regulations regarding the grant of leave in India, or for short periods to sea, whether on private affairs or on sick certificate, except as to the periods of such absence being taken into calculation in the time allowed to count as service for retirement on full pay.\n\n---\n\n**INDIAN MILITARY FURLOUGH RULES OF 1868.**\n\n(WITH SUBSEQUENT ALTERATIONS.)\n\nGENERAL ORDER BY THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA, DATED 25th FEBRUARY, 1874, No. 171.\n\nThe rules previously in force will be designated, as heretofore, the Furlough Rules of 1796 and 1854. The following G. G. O.'s are cancelled prospectively from the 1st January 1875:\u2014\n\nG. G. O. No. 630 of 1869 (1st clause).\nG. G. O. No. 627 of 1870.\nG. G. O. No. 613 of 1871.\n\n* For the periods allowed under Pension Regulations of 1881 see page lxxxiv.\n2. These rules are applicable to all officers who, on the 1st July, 1863, belonged to the several Indian Staff Corps, or to the Indian Army, and who have elected, or may elect, Rules apply to Officers of Staff Corps and to adopt them; officers of the British Army who entered the Indian Army.\n\n(2) In regard to the periods of leave of absence during which appointments may be held, and in regard to the increased allowances they are also applicable to officers of the Royal Artillery and Royal Engineers late of the Indian Army, holding permanent staff appointments not of a regimental nature, and to such officers of the Engineers of the Imperial Establishment as may be permanently employed on the staff in India.\n\n(3) But should an officer of the British Service, holding such permanent staff appointment, be allowed to proceed on leave under circumstances which, by these rules, would involve loss of appointment, he cannot take leave under them, but simply as a British Officer holding no appointment.\n\n3. These rules are not applicable to officers on the Invalid or Invalid Pension Establishment, even if previous to their transfer they should have elected them, being intended solely for officers on the effective list.\n\nDo not apply to Invalid Officers.\n\nThey are not applicable to Regimental Officers generally of the British Service, whether formerly belonging to the Indian Army, and now in the Royal Artillery, Royal Engineers, and new Line Regiments, or on the old Line Establishment, even though formerly of Indian Army.\n\nNote (1).\u2014British Medical Staff Officers holding administrative appointments in India tenable for 5 years, who are compelled by ill health to return to England, will be allowed by the Government of India in the Military Department to proceed there to appear before a Medical Board, and if reported unfit for further service in India, will be removed from the Indian Establishment; if otherwise, they may be allowed by the Secretary of State for India 6 months' leave on medical certificate on their Indian allowances and half staff.\n\nSuch Officers are also eligible for 4 months' leave on private affairs without pay, but only one grant of leave will be allowed out of India during their tenure of office.\n\nNote (2).\u2014All British officers holding Staff appointments in India, except the command of Divisions and Brigades, will be allowed, during their five years' tenure of office, only one grant of leave out of India either on medical certificate for six months with absentee allowances regulated under the furlough rules of 1868, or on private affairs for four months, with British pay, from Indian revenues. Any leave obtained in excess of either of these periods will involve loss of appointment.\n\n5. They are applicable to Officers of the Royal Engineers on the Imperial Establishment, who are employed in the Public Works Department, or who are receiving a staff salary as on the fixed establishment of the Sappers and Miners; these will count service towards furlough from the date of their arrival in India.\n\nApply to R. E. Officers on the Imperial list, holding permanent non-regimental staff appointments.\n\n(2.) These officers, therefore, and other Royal Engineer Officers of the Imperial list on permanent staff employ under the Government, will be entitled to a furlough of two years after eight years' service in India, or at the expiration of one year from the date of their return (for a second tour of service in India) on the completion of the prescribed home service after the first period of seven years' service in India.\n\n(3.) Such Officers will be allowed an advance of passage money, or free passage in a troop-ship if proceeding in the trooping season; the advance to be refunded on receipt of the balance of furlough pay. The English rate of pay of their rank only will be passed to them during their leave; but at its conclusion, on their presenting an order for them to return to India, the difference between that rate and furlough pay, less the passage money they have received, will be paid to them in England conditionally on its refund, if the order to return to India is not carried out.\n\n(4.) Those Royal Engineer Officers who arrived in India before the 1st July, 1872, are, however, not subject to the provisions of the preceding clause as long as they do not exchange Indian for home service, but draw furlough pay during furlough, as others.\n\nNote.\u2014Royal Engineers of the Imperial List may receive their pay while on furlough, either under the regulations in force before February, 1873, or under the terms of General Order No. 123 of 1873, that is to say, an officer of Engineers of the Imperial List may, at his option, on taking furlough to England, either receive furlough pay on the understanding that, should he not return to India, he will have to refund the difference between it* and English pay, less the regulated amount of passage money, or a free passage and English pay only during the period of his furlough, the difference between English pay and furlough pay, less the cost of his passage, being issued to him upon his return to duty in India.\n\n2.\u2014The officer's choice should be made at the time of applying for furlough, and should be noted on his last pay certificate.\n\n* Under the terms of India Army Circulars, 1886, clause 196, Indian furlough pay for the following periods is not subject to refund on reversion to the Imperial Establishment:\u2014\n\n| After 8 years' Indian service | 1 year. |\n|------------------------------|--------|\n| \" 9 \"                        | \" 1 \" 2 months. |\n| \" 10 \"                       | \" 1 \" 4 \" |\n| \" 11 \"                       | \" 1 \" 6 \" |\n| \" 12 \"                       | \" 1 \" 8 \" |\n| \" 13 \"                       | \" 1 \" 10 \" |\n| \" 14 \"                       | \" 2 years. |\n\n(5.) An officer of the British Service, holding permanent staff employ under the Government, who may proceed on furlough under circumstances which involve the forfeiture of his appointment, must obtain the furlough as a British regimental officer, and it will reckon as a portion of the aggregate eight years of furlough on pay to which an officer is restricted during his service by Rule XVI. But, on again becoming permanently employed, he resumes the right of obtaining furlough under these rules.\n\n6. Officers of British Regiments who may join the Staff Corps can count as service towards furlough all their military service in India, provided that half of it (in no case less than four years) shall have been passed in the Staff Corps. But any leave to England they may have taken during service so counted will be reckoned as furlough already taken. Officers of the British Service who formerly belonged to the Indian Armies are exempted from the above proviso.\n7. These rules apply also to all Warrant Officers holding Veteran or Honorary Commissions, who may elect them; the period of service qualifying for furlough being calculated from the date of the attainment of a Commission. They will receive during furlough half their total receipts, calculated as laid down in Rule V., but without any reference to a minimum or maximum rate. Warrant Officers not holding Commissions can obtain furlough under these rules only on medical certificate.\n\n(2.) Such furlough may be for two years with retention of appointment and half of the aggregate allowances; but any extension of such leave (which will not be granted for more than one year in excess of the two years) or any leave taken within less than three years from the date of last return to duty, will be on \"English furlough pay.\" [See Note (1) to para. 9.]\n\n8. Every Warrant Officer who attained warrant rank before the 19th February, 1869, and who has not made his election, will be required, on the first occasion of his applying for leave out of India, to state whether he desires to take the leave under these rules, or under those previously in force applicable to Warrant Officers, viz., G. G. O. Nos. 518 and 531 of 1854, G. G. O. No. 1559 of 1857, and subsequent orders. That election will be considered final.\n\n(2.) Those who became Warrant Officers after 19th February, 1869, are subject to these rules, and cannot elect any of the previous rules.\n\n(3.) Leave on medical certificate on Indian pay and allowances to places eastward of the Cape, as allowed to Commissioned Officers under the Furlough Rules of 1796, is not in any case admissible to a Warrant Officer.\n\n(4.) These Rules respecting Warrant Officers apply to Honorary Assistant Surgeons and Warrant Officers in the Medical Department.\n\n9. The term \"Furlough Pay\" having now a changed and twofold signification, in all future orders and references \"Furlough Pay\" will be understood as the half Indian salary within the prescribed limits specified in paragraph V. of these rules, converted at the rate of exchange fixed by the Secretary of State for the official year, whilst \"English Furlough Pay\" will represent the rates heretofore allowed to the several grades as English pay under the rules of 1796 and 1854.\n\nNote (1).\u2014Where in these Rules English furlough pay is mentioned as that to which an officer is to be restricted, the rates laid down in paragraph II of G. G. O. No. 69, dated 22nd January, 1868, and (for Medical Warrant Officers) paragraph 22 of G. G. O. No. 550 of 1868, are to be understood as intended in the cases of Warrant Officers.\n\nNote (2).\u2014Officers who elected these rules prior to 1st July 1871, or before G. G. O. No. 588 of 1871 reached their stations, will receive furlough pay at the exchange of 2s. the rupee.\n\nRULES\n\nI.\u2014The distinction with respect to allowances which has been hitherto drawn between furlough on private affairs and sick leave, is abolished, both kinds of leave being included under the general term furlough, provision, however, being made for the obtaining of furlough under medical certificate, without all the restrictions applicable to furlough when taken without medical certificate.\n\nII.\u2014Leave taken under the rules now prescribed will not involve forfeiture of appointment, except in the cases herein specially provided for.\n\n2. Officers of the Staff Corps and Local Indian Service, and Officers on the General List, can retain their appointments during all leave of absence granted by competent authority. But their pay during such absence will be the same as they would obtain under these rules had this exemption from forfeiture of appointment not been granted.\n\nNote.\u2014The above Rule is applicable to all Military and Medical Officers taking furlough or leave under these Regulations.\n\nIII.\u2014The Rules now prescribed do not affect the provisions of Act XXXIII. of George III., Chapter 59, Section 70; but an absentee cannot retain his appointment and draw absentee allowances, except under the rules now prescribed. Nor do they affect the regulations by which General Officers Commanding Divisions and Brigades can only obtain limited periods of leave without forfeiting their Commands.\n\nIV.\u2014Leave of absence will in future be of three kinds, viz.:\n\n1.\u2014Furlough in or out of India.\n\nII.\u2014General leave on private affairs or sick certificate in India, or short leave to sea.\n\nIII.\u2014Privilege leave.\n\n* The section referred to is quoted below:\n\nSection 70.\u2014\"And be it further enacted that no person who shall have held any civil or military station whatever in India, in the service of the said United Company, being under the rank or degree of a Member of Council or Commander-in-Chief of the Forces, and who, having departed from India by leave of the Governor-General in Council, shall not return to India within the space of five years next after such departure, shall be entitled to any rank or restoration of office, or be capable of again serving in India, either in the European or Native Corps of Troops or in the civil line of the Company's Service, unless in the case of any Civil Servant of the Company, it shall be proved to the satisfaction of the Court of Directors that such absence was occasioned by sickness or infirmity, or, in the event of some inevitable accident, by a vote or resolution passed by way of resolution by three parts in four of the proprietors assembled in General Court, specially convened for that purpose, whereof eight days' previous notice of the time and purpose of such meeting shall be given in The London Gazette, or unless, in the case of any Military Officer, it shall be proved to the satisfaction of the said Court of Directors and the Board of Commissioners for the affairs of India that such absence was occasioned by sickness or infirmity, or some inevitable accident.\"\nCHAPTER I.\n\nFurlough.\n\nV.\u2014An officer drawing staff pay in addition to pay of rank, proceeding on furlough, will be allowed pay at Furlough pay, how reckoned.\n\n1. But an officer in civil employ and drawing consolidated salary, will be allowed 50 per cent. of the average salary drawn by him during the three years prior to his proceeding on furlough, or during his actual service in India should that be less than three years; and the time spent and the allowances drawn during any leave other than \"privilege leave,\" will be omitted in the calculation of average salary.\n\n2. No absentee shall in either case draw more than \u00a31,000, or less than \u00a3250 per annum.\n\n3. The term \"salary\" will signify the total amount drawn by an officer, whether as consolidated pay, or staff allowances in addition to pay, but will not include any extra or special allowances. But in the case of a military officer in civil employ, his acting allowances shall be taken into account as a part of his salary in calculating his furlough pay.\n\n4. An officer absent on furlough, who may be transferred to another office during his absence, shall be entitled, for the entire period of his furlough, to furlough pay at the rate sanctioned to him when leaving India, whatever the salary of the office to which he may be transferred may be. This furlough pay will be continued to an officer in military employ after his return to India and until he joins his appointment, provided it is not less than the military pay, or pay and allowances, of his rank.\n\n5. But an officer whose term of office shall lapse, who shall vacate his appointment, or whose appointment shall be abolished during his furlough, will revert at once to the furlough pay which he would draw in virtue of his rank, as laid down below, in Section 8. Any case of sudden abolition of appointment may, however, be specially considered in the department of the Government under which the officer may have been employed. An officer will also be entitled to the benefit of his promotion to a higher Staff Corps or regimental rank, whilst on furlough, subject to the maximum limit.\n\n6. Officers holding regimental medical charges will be allowed to retain such charges during the authorized periods of furlough, as if they were medical staff appointments. And the difference between the unemployed grade pay of the officer holding the substantive charge and the consolidated salary of the charge will be considered the staff salary divisible between the absentee and the officer officiating for him.\n\n7. Officers not in staff employ will receive half the Indian pay of their rank, provided that an officer entitled to furlough shall in no case receive less than the above minimum of \u00a3250 per annum.\n\nNote.\u2014Officers who may be entitled to income allowance from the Military Fund during absence in Europe, will draw their half salary or minimum absentee allowance under the foregoing clause, subject to a deduction equivalent to the amount of such income allowance.\n\nVI.\u2014All grants of furlough on private affairs are subject to the exigencies of the public service,\u2014of which exigency the Government is to be exclusively the judge,\u2014and to any regulations that may be found necessary for limiting the number of absentees.\n\nNote.\u2014It is therefore within the competency of local Governments and of the Commander-in-Chief to decline to forward the application of any officer whose absence would, in their opinion, be detrimental to the interests of the public service, until such time as arrangements can be made for removing the difficulty; and it is the duty of the head of every department to decline to forward any application for furlough whenever the services of the officer cannot be spared without risking the efficiency of the department, any doubtful case being referred for the orders of Government.\n\nVII.\u2014The maximum amount of furlough on private affairs to be taken at any one time, carrying pay and retention of appointment, will be two years: any extension of such furlough will be without pay unless it is on medical certificate, see Rule XIII. (But see Notes (3) and (4) Rule IX.) And no extension on private affairs beyond two years will be granted, though without pay, except upon satisfactory evidence of very urgent necessity.\n\nVIII.\u2014A period of at least three years' service after return from last furlough, except furlough for a period not exceeding six months under Rule XI. (and excepting also, in the case of an officer in civil employ, ordinary furlough not exceeding three months) must be completed before furlough can again be taken, unless obtained under medical certificate (see Rules XIII. and XIV. and Note 3 of Rule IX.).\n\nNote (1).\u2014An officer in civil employ cannot reckon in this interval of three years any period of absence from actual duty, excepting privilege leave.\n\nNote (2).\u2014Although furlough not exceeding 3 months taken by officers in civil employ is not considered as furlough requiring an interval of 3 years' duty, such furlough will be excluded from the period of 3 years' service required between two furloughs.\n\n2. But an officer who may be ordered to return to duty before the completion of his furlough for the purpose of proceeding on field service may be allowed to take the balance of such furlough at any time.\n\nIX.\u2014An officer will be eligible for two years' furlough on the completion of eight years' actual service in India (see para. 6 of this order); for a third year after a further period of six years' actual service, and for a fourth and fifth year after similar intervals of six years, and so on, up to the maximum prescribed in Rule XVI. The grant of furlough to an officer eligible for it will be subject only to the conditions specified in Rules VI. and VII. But see notes to this Rule.\n\n* As modified by Army Circulars, India, July, 1886, Clause 93.\n1.* Leave granted under these Rules, without furlough pay, will not reckon as furlough already taken in calculating the balance at an officer's credit, or as part of the total of eight years allowed as shown in Rule XVI, but all furlough with furlough pay, whether on private affairs or on medical certificate, taken under these Rules, will so reckon.\n\n2.* Furlough and leave previously taken under the Rules of 1796 or 1854, will count, as respects officers who have elected these Rules, as follows:\n\nHow far previous furlough bars furlough on private affairs.\n\nFurlough on private affairs, with pay, taken under the Rules of 1796 or 1854, counts in all respects as furlough.\n\nLeave on sick certificate, under the Rules of 1796, does not count in any respect as furlough.\n\nLeave on sick certificate, with pay, under the Rules of 1854, counts as part of the maximum of eight years allowed under these Rules, but until the maximum thus made up be reached, this leave will not count as furlough already taken in determining the amount of furlough to which an officer is entitled.\n\nLeave without pay under the Rules either of 1796 or 1854 does not count in any respects as furlough.\n\nN.B.\u2014Furlough on medical certificate with \"Furlough pay\" obtained by officers, under Rule IX., Note (1) of these Regulations, between the publication of G. G. Orders No. 171 of the 25th February, 1874, and No. 197 of the 1st March, 1877, will not be reckoned as \"Furlough already taken\" in computing the amount of furlough at the credit of such officers; but it will form part of the aggregate of eight years allowed to officers.\n\nNote (1).\u2014An officer of less than eight years' service in India may obtain furlough not exceeding two years, on medical certificate, with furlough pay and retention of appointment, provided he has been three years in the Staff Corps, or\u2014in the case of a Royal Engineer officer holding a permanent staff appointment, or an officer not in the Staff Corps\u2014has served for three years in India.\n\nNote (2).\u2014If the officer has not been three years in the Staff Corps or served three years in India, as the case may be, he will receive \"English furlough pay\" only, and must vacate his appointment, unless entitled to retain it under Rule II.\n\nNote (3).\u2014This rule (in Note 2) and the proviso in Note (1), however, are not applicable to officers of the Indian Army who entered the new Line Regiments, or Royal Artillery, and subsequently the Staff Corps.\n\nNote (4).\u2014Unemployed General Officers of the Staff Corps or local service can be granted furlough without serving the intervals of three and six years, respectively, prescribed in Rules VIII. and IX., and they can remain in Europe after they have exhausted the full period of furlough allowed during an officer's service by Rule XVI. (eight years on the whole) on the English furlough pay of their rank.\n\nNote (5).\u2014And a Major-General of the Staff Corps\u2014if he has so much furlough at his credit, and proceeds to England within a year of his being promoted to that rank, or of his ceasing to be employed\u2014can continue, after the expiration of the two years' furlough to receive half his Indian pay until he completes the period of three years during which he would be entitled to draw his Staff Corps pay if he were in India.\n\n3. If an officer appointed to any duty in England draws his Indian allowances, with or without any portion of his staff salary, he can count the period of such employment as service towards furlough; but if he is appointed to an office in England to which a fixed consolidated salary is attached, he cannot reckon the time of such employment as service towards furlough.\n\nX.\u2014An officer eligible for furlough need not take the whole amount to which his service entitles him, but may apply for any portion thereof as an instalment; and in that case the balance will remain at his credit in any future computation of the amount of furlough for which he may be eligible.\n\nIllustrations.\n\n1. An officer who has served nine years in India is entitled to two years' furlough: he takes only one year, and after his return remains in India for five years.\n\nHe is then eligible for two years' furlough as follows:\n\nTotal service in India ................................................................. 14 years.\nFurlough due on that service ......................................................... 3,\nFurlough already taken ............................................................... 1 year.\nBalance for which he is eligible ..................................................... 2 years.\n\n2. An officer who has served 20 years in India without taking furlough is entitled to four years' furlough. He can only take, however, two years at one time carrying pay, the balance remaining at his credit in any future computation of furlough to which he may be entitled. He can take that balance after completing three years' service from the date of his return from the first instalment.\n\nNote.\u2014An officer is said to have furlough at his credit,\u2014even though he may not be able to obtain it owing to the number of absentees, or other causes,\u2014when the calculation of his service, as in illustration 1 above, shows a \"balance for which he is eligible.\"\n\n* XL.\u2014Furlough on urgent private affairs for six months on pay equivalent to the British regimental pay of his rank, may be granted when the officer has less than six months' furlough at his credit, or when from other causes, e.g. the number of absentees, or his not having served three years since his last return to duty, he is not able to take it. The said period may form part of the periods of either eight or six years referred to in Rule IX., and also\u2014except in the case of an officer in civil employ, see Rule VIII. (Note 1)\u2014of the three years which are required to intervene between two periods of furlough by Rule VIII.\n\n\u2020 Furlough under this article is not admissible to an officer in civil employ, who is eligible for the grant of special leave on urgent private affairs under the Civil Leave Code.\n\n2. This leave cannot be given in extension of any furlough, neither can it be extended beyond the six months unless on medical certificate; in which case the whole of the leave will be considered as if taken under Rule XIV., clause 1.\n\n* As modified in G. G. O. No. 197 of 1st March, 1877.\n\u2020 Army Circulars, India, July, 1886, Clause 33.\nNOTE.\u2014Ill-health is not considered as warranting furlough under this rule to any officer who under the provisions of these rules can obtain furlough on medical certificate without forfeiting his appointment.\n\nXII.\u2014Subject to State considerations, there will be no restriction as to the places to which an officer may resort during furlough. But, if he desires to spend in England the rest of a \"furlough in India,\" or vice versa, he must obtain permission to do so from the Government of his Presidency, or from the Secretary of State for India, as the case may be; and on landing in either country, he must report his arrival accordingly to the Military Department of his own Presidency, or to the India Office, forwarding a copy of the permission granted him to change his destination. He must also communicate his address. An officer who, on his return to India, reports his debarkation, without forwarding at once a copy of the permission granted him to change his destination, or submitting an application for such permission, will be considered to have returned to his duty.\n\nReports, &c., required.\n\nXIII.\u2014Furlough on medical certificate is obtainable as indicated in Notes (1) and (2) of Rule IX. and in Rule XIV. Absence on such furlough for a longer period than two years at one time will involve forfeiture of appointment. [But see exceptions in Rule II.] Furlough may, however, be extended on medical certificate up to a third year on \"English furlough pay;\" and an officer on furlough on private affairs, who may be obliged to obtain an extension on medical certificate, will be thenceforward entitled to the same advantages, and subjected to the same disadvantages as to retention of appointment, pay, &c., as if he had originally obtained furlough on medical certificate.\n\nIf he exceeds three years' absence on medical certificate, the officer may have to retire or go on half-pay.\n\nExtension on medical certificate over three years to be without pay.\n\nOfficers on medical certificate must be pronounced fit for duty before returning to India.\n\nXIV.\u2014An officer whose health may necessitate his taking furlough within three years from the date of last return from any furlough except that taken for a period not exceeding six months under Rule XI. (and excepting also, in the case of an officer in civil employ, ordinary furlough not exceeding three months), may obtain under the usual medical certificate, such amount as may be duly certified to be necessary for the restoration of his health; but he will receive only \"English furlough pay,\" and must vacate any appointment he may be holding, unless entitled to retain it under Rule II.\n\n2. If, however, he shall have served three years since the date of his last return to duty, although there may be no balance of furlough at his credit, he will be entitled, on obtaining furlough on medical certificate, to retain his appointment and to receive \"furlough pay,\" as laid down in Rule V., for the entire period not exceeding two years. Should the latter period be exceeded, he will come under the provisions of Rule XIII.\n\nXV.\u2014An officer entitled to furlough, or having a balance of furlough at his credit, whose health may necessitate his absence from India, must take the leave as furlough under Rule IX., but without forfeiting any passage-money to which he may be entitled under Military Fund Rules,\u2014or, if a Subaltern, by Regulation, when proceeding on medical certificate.\n\nShould the officer be declared fit for duty before the expiration of two years, he may be granted extension on private affairs up to that limit, provided that he has so much at his credit, and that if he remains he will not be in excess of the established proportion of absentees. Any extension on private affairs of such furlough beyond the said period of two years, must be without pay.\n\n3. Any extension on medical certificate of furlough under this rule beyond two years must be on \"English furlough pay\" under Rule XIII.\n\nXVI.\u2014The aggregate amount of furlough with pay and retention of appointment, on private affairs and on medical certificate, that may be granted to an officer during his service will be limited to eight years.\n\nNOTE 1.\u2014This aggregate is calculated agreeably to clause 1 and 2 of Rule IX.\n\nNOTE 2.\u2014Furlough allowed by proper authority to reckon as service for pension under the provisions of J. G. O.'s No. 1113 of 1857, and 95 of 1866, or in consequence of an officer's employment on any duty during his furlough, will not reckon as part of the aggregate period of eight years.\n\n* XVII.\u2014If taken in India, furlough is reckoned from the date of the absentee's quitting his station to that of his return thereto. If taken out of India, furlough commences from the date on which the vessel on which the officer embarks quits her moorings or anchorage, whether she leaves the limits of the port or not, and terminates on the day immediately preceding that on which the vessel on which he returns to India drops her anchor or is moored at any Indian port. An officer's furlough begins on the vessel's departure from any Indian port at which he first joins her, and ends on the day before her arrival at the port where he last quits her.\n\nNOTE 1.\u2014Furlough out of India taken before the 17th November, 1883, reckoned from the date of the sailing of the vessel on which any officer embarked, or (if from Calcutta) the date on which she left the Sandheads to the date of disembarkation, the latter being considered as a day of duty. (But see exception in Note 2).\n\n* Army Circulars, India, 1882, Clause 58.\nNOTE 2.\u2014From the 4th April, 1870, to the 14th September, 1874, inclusive, the date of disembarkation was reckoned as a day of furlough and not of duty.\n\nNOTE 3.\u2014The furlough of an officer ordered to India before its expiration for special duty or on account of the exigencies of the service terminates on the day previous to that of his embarkation for India from any port in England or the Continent of Europe. When the officer avails himself of the balance of his furlough, it commences on the day of his first landing either in England or on the Continent of Europe.\n\nXVIII.\u2014Subsidiary leave to embark for Europe or elsewhere on furlough will be granted for any period deemed necessary, not ordinarily exceeding 30 days. Leave up to the same limit, to enable him to rejoin on his return from furlough, will be granted from the date of his disembarkation in India. This applies equally to furloughs taken under Rule XI. The authority which has power to grant subsidiary leave can, on due cause being shown, grant any necessary extension of it, but this can be done only on very sufficient reasons.\n\nNOTE (1).\u2014The words \"with the necessary subsidiary leave\" will be added to the G. G. O. granting an officer furlough, and will be understood to mean both the leave granted before embarkation for Europe, and on return.\n\nNOTE (2).\u2014An officer obtaining a furlough on private affairs or medical certificate must embark within three months of the date of the General Order which notifies it, or take up the first portion of his furlough in India until he embarks; if not, the General Order will cease to have effect. The only exception to this rule that can be allowed is when the officer is prevented from embarking within the three months owing to his detention in India by proper authority on bona fide public grounds. If, however, the officer does not, within a reasonable time, avail himself of the furlough given him, his subsequently being placed on duty rendering his detention necessary will not exempt him from the rule; and in every case of such detention the officer must at once report it, and he is not to embark after the expiration of three months until he has applied for and obtained from the Government of his Presidency an extension of the period.\n\nNOTE (3).\u2014Officers who may be serving in other Presidencies than their own, if they desire to embark bona fide for Europe from the latter, may obtain subsidiary leave accordingly, and their furlough will reckon from the date of their embarkation at their own Presidencies.\n\nN.B.\u2014For full information as to the submission of applications for furlough, see Bengal Army Regulations, Sect. 13.\n\nApplication for furlough, how submitted.\n\nNOTE (4).\u2014The allowances of Military officers in civil employ during subsidiary leave, and after return to India until they rejoin their appointments, will be adjusted according to Civil Rules.\n\nLeave preparatory to retirement.\n\nNOTE (5).\u2014Leave preparatory to retirement from the service does not reckon as service towards pension.\n\nNOTE (6).\u2014An officer unavoidably detained at the Presidency for passage in a troopship, beyond the usual subsidiary leave, shall count the period of such detention as subsidiary leave.\n\nPay issued monthly in India, quarterly in England.\n\nXX.*\u2014Advances of furlough pay will continue to be made in India to those officers who desire it for three months from date of embarkation. Payments in continuation will be made in England on the expiration of six months from that date.\n\nXXI.\u2014The last pay certificate issued to each officer who may be granted furlough, whether on private affairs or on medical certificate, will specify the rate of the pay and staff salary of his last substantive appointment, and the rate to which he will be entitled in Europe in virtue of Rule V.\n\nPay of officers acting for those on furlough.\n\nXXII.+\u2014An Officer acting in India for an absentee on furlough pay, &c., counting as service towards pension.\u00a7\n\nPay of Warrant Officers acting for others on furlough.\n\n\u2020 NOTE.\u2014The indulgence granted by the above rule is only, allowed to one directly officiating in the place of the officer absent on furlough, not to one acting in the room of an officer who is himself acting for an absentee on furlough.\n\nPeriods of furlough, &c., counting as service towards pension.\u00a7\n\napplicable to those who elect these rules subject (in the case of officers under the Rules of 1796) to the condition laid down in \u00a7 4 of Rule XXXIV.\n\nPeriods of furlough reckoned by Warrant Officers towards pension.\n\n| Periods | Service |\n|---------|---------|\n| 15 months | 12 years' Departmental Service. |\n| 20       |        |\n| 24       |        |\n\n3.

The balance within the limit of eight years total furlough on private affairs and medical certificate laid down in Rule XVI., will represent the leave to which he will be entitled on the expiration of not less than three years from his last return to duty. (See Sections 1 and 2 of Rule IX.)\n\nIllustration.\n\n(1).\u2014An officer, who had obtained under the existing rules two years' furlough after ten years' service, returns to India on the date on which this order is promulgated. He accepts its conditions and serves four years longer in India.

During the entire period of his absence on this account the officer will be entitled, as at present, to his full pay and a moiety of his staff salary. Leave taken under this rule will form no part of the eight years' aggregate furlough. If this indulgence should be taken advantage of for a third year consecutively the officer will lose his staff appointment unless entitled to retain it under Rule II.\n\nXXVI.\u2014Leave on sick certificate for a period exceeding six months, capable of extension, under renewed medical certificate, to a limit of one year, may be granted to any officer who, in the opinion of a Medical Board, may require it. Leave of this nature, taken after the promulgation of these rules, will be held to constitute a part of the maximum period of eight years' leave of absence to which an officer is entitled in his entire period of service, but will not be regarded as furlough, nor will it affect the intervals entitling to furlough laid down in Rule IX. During this leave the absentee will draw a moiety of his staff salary in addition to the pay of his rank. But if the 12 months be exceeded, the whole leave must be reckoned as furlough, and allowances be adjusted accordingly.\n\nXXVII.\u2014Short leave, not exceeding three months, on private affairs or sick certificate, may also be allowed heretofore.\n\nXXVIII.\u2014A general leave taken in India counts as part of the leave reckoning against service for pension.\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nPrivilege Leave.\n\nXXIX.\u2014Privilege leave may be granted, as at present, for sixty days in each year to all officers in military employ, without deduction from the salaries and emoluments drawn by them. General leave, in extension of privilege leave, can only be granted on the ground of sickness, or some other serious emergency which could not have been foreseen when the officer proceeded on privilege leave. Privilege leave may, however, be converted into general leave with the sanction of the Commander-in-Chief or the Government.\n\nNote (I).\u2014Privilege leave for ninety days, after thirty-three months' duty, which may be spent anywhere, in or out of India, is admissible to Commissioned and Warrant Officers under these Rules; but to claim the privilege, it shall be necessary for an officer to show that he has had no privilege leave for thirty-three months previous to the date of his application, and that he has made satisfactory arrangements for the performance of his duties during his absence at no additional cost to the State. If leave for a shorter period than 90 days is taken, the balance is forfeited.\nXXX.\u2014In the case of the stations noted in the margin, privilege leave may, as at present, be granted for ninety days to officers of local Corps, or of Corps which are usually employed in one or other of the districts named.\n\nAssam. Khairwara. Dera Ghazee Khan.\nShillong. Khatra. Rajampore.\nSrinagar. Bunnoo. Jacobabad.\nDeccan. Dera Ismael Khan.\n\nNote.\u2014The above rule is not applicable to officers of regiments moved in course of relief to any of the stations, or who are only temporarily employed there.\n\nXXXI.\u2014An officer is at liberty to proceed wherever he may desire on privilege leave, provided he can ensure his return before the expiration of his leave.\n\nXXXII.\u2014Privilege leave cannot be taken in continuation of furlough, nor can furlough be obtained in continuation of privilege leave. If furlough be obtained by an officer while absent on privilege leave, the privilege leave will be converted into general leave, the officer for that period sacrificing a moiety of his staff salary.\n\nMilitary Officers in Civil Employ.\n\nXXXIII.\u2014Those Military Officers (including Warrant Officers who hold Honorary, Veteran, or Unattached Commissions) in Civil or Political employ who may elect these rules when they take leave in India, come, as respects periods of leave obtainable and amount of pay to be granted, under the Civil Leave Rules. When they take leave out of India, they come under the Military Leave Rules. (See however Rule XI.)\n\nNote.\u2014Furlough in India is allowed under Chapter I of these rules to a Military Officer in civil employ, under the same chapter, by the Government to which he is subordinate; as also subsidiary, privilege, and examination leave under the rules in the Civil Leave Code; but under no circumstances will he be allowed any leave out of India under the Civil Leave Code, but under Military rules and by the Military Department.\n\nWhen furlough in India is required by a Military Officer in civil employ, he must obtain from the Military Department, and submit to the Accountant General a \"Furlough certificate;\" and when furlough is granted by the Government to which the officer is subordinate, a copy of the order granting the furlough should be sent to the Military Department.\n\n(2.) For subsidiary leave, see Note (5) of Rule XVIII.\n\nSubsidiary Rule.\n\nXXXIV.\u2014Officers of the Indian Military and Medical services will be required generally to notify their intention to accept these rules or to adhere to those now existing, on the first occasion of their taking furlough or general leave after the publication of this order. Such election must be considered final, and under no plea whatever will an officer be subsequently relieved from the choice thus made.\n\n1. Officers going home under these Rules will pay English rates of subscription only to the Military Fund.\n\n2. Officers who may determine to abide by existing Rules will be allowed to proceed on furlough on the conditions laid down in Rules VII., VIII., and XIII., to the extent to which they may be entitled under the Furlough Regulations of 1854, or of 1796, whichever of the two they may have elected, and on the rates of pay contemplated in those Regulations, but retaining their appointments. The principle laid down in Rule XV. must, however, be applied in those cases.\n\n3. Officers who may determine to abide by existing Rules will be allowed to proceed on furlough on the conditions laid down in Rules VII., VIII., and XIII., to the extent to which they may be entitled under the Furlough Regulations of 1854, or of 1796, whichever of the two they may have elected, and on the rates of pay contemplated in those Regulations, but retaining their appointments. The principle laid down in Rule XV. must, however, be applied in those cases.\n\n4. If an officer under the Furlough Rules of 1796 elects the present Rules, his service for pension will be reckoned under the former Rules up to 1st July, 1868, and thenceforward under the Rules of 1868; and the fact of the officer having been on furlough on 1st July, 1868, and not then having elected the Rules of 1868, will not affect the case. All periods of leave out of Indian limits taken previous to 1st July, 1868, will be wholly excluded from his service for pension; but he may reckon towards pension periods of leave taken subsequent to that date, according to the length of his service counting for pension, as shown in Rule XXIII.\n\n5. His election of these Furlough Rules in no way affects his right to retire under the Pension Rules of 1796.\n\nFURLOUGH AND LEAVE RULES OF 1875.\n\n(WITH SUBSEQUENT ALTERATIONS.)\n\nG.G.O. No. 1,316, dated 30th December, 1875.\n\nI. Officers included in Schedule A may receive, after five years' service in India or under the Government of India, one year's furlough, and an additional year for each subsequent five years' service. Furlough not taken at the time it becomes due is not lost, and can, subject to these rules, be taken later.\n\nNote.\u2014Service for furlough under these rules, in the case of an officer electing them, is reckoned from the date of his election. (See also Notes 2 and 3 to Schedule A.)\n\nII. An Officer may receive at any time any portion of the furlough to which he is entitled; but, except under Rule 8, he may not be absent from duty on any ground for more than three years consecutively; nor, on return from furlough, may he receive, except under Rule 6, any further portion of the furlough to which he is entitled until after the interval of two years.\n\nIII. It must be distinctly understood that furlough is subject to the exigencies of the public service. Officers commanding regiments, and Heads of Departments, will forward no application for furlough unless able to satisfy the superior authorities that the Officer's services can be spared without any inconvenience to the public service.\n\nIV. Furlough does not involve forfeiture of appointment, may be spent anywhere, and counts as service for pension. (See Rule XVIII.)\n\nV.* A commissioned Officer on furlough receives (up to, but not beyond, the sum of \u00a31,000 a year) half the emoluments of his office, computed according to a rate of exchange to be fixed in each year by the Secretary\n\n* As modified by G.G.O. No. 410 of 11 May, 1877.\nof State; but in any case he does not receive less than \u00a3250 a year. The emoluments of his office include all pay, staff corps pay, staff salary, and Indian allowances he would receive in respect to it if he were on duty, and for the purpose of each payment his office is the office he fills on the day when that payment becomes due.\n\n2. A Warrant Officer receives half the emoluments of his office, calculated in the same manner as those of Commissioned Officers, no Warrant Officer, however, receiving as furlough pay less than the English furlough pay of his rank.\n\nVI. Upon certificate of a Medical Board, an Officer not entitled to furlough, if he has served not less than two years in India, may receive it for any period not exceeding two years; but such furlough will be deducted from his next accruing furlough until it is paid off. An Officer will not be allowed to anticipate furlough under this rule to an aggregate amount of more than two years.\n\nNote.\u2014An Officer of less than two years' service from date of coming under the new rules, falling sick, will be sent to England on medical certificate, on English furlough pay, without the period of his furlough being fixed, subject to the decision of Her Majesty's Government as to his ultimate disposal; a special report on each case being submitted to her Majesty's Government by the Government of India, or in the case of Officers of the Madras or Bombay army by the Government of those Presidencies. (See notes 2 and 3 to Schedule A.)\n\n\u2020 Furlough on medical certificate under this rule (except in the case of Officers invalided home for sickness due to wounds, or other cause, solely attributable to active service in the field) does not count as service for pension until it has been paid off as provided for in the rule; when due solely to active service in the field it is allowed to reckon as service for pension without being paid off as provided for under ordinary circumstances in the rule; but it does not count as service for furlough; i.e., an officer obtaining it shall still be required to put in the full Indian service qualifying for furlough under the Rules of 1875, with the condition also that he shall complete two years' further service in India before availing himself of it.\n\n\u2021 An officer serving under the Regulations of 1875, who has been allowed to count as service for pension any furlough taken under Rule VI., due to active service in the field, under the provisions of India Army Circulars, Clause 170 of 1881, and Clause 41 of 1882, may, should the circumstances of the case warrant the indulgence, be again permitted to anticipate furlough to an amount of not more than two years in all, under Rule VI. In all cases of the grant of furlough under the foregoing ruling a special report is to be made to the Secretary of State.\n\n\u00a7 All furlough due to wounds or illness solely attributable to active service in the field shall be treated as \"extraordinary furlough,\" reckoning as service for pension and not subject to repayment. The rules published in clause 154 India Army Circulars of 1881 and Clause 112 of 1883 will govern the grant of the above concession, and the maximum amount of furlough to be treated as \"extraordinary furlough\" will be two years.\n\nVII. An Officer who has exhausted the furlough obtainable under these rules, and who may be certified by a Medical Board to be still unfit for duty, will be placed temporarily or permanently on half-pay, according to the circumstances of the case.\n\nVIII. Under very urgent circumstances, special furlough may be granted for private affairs, which need not be paid back; but it will be in all cases without any kind of pay, and will not count for pension.\n\nNote.\u2014The amount of leave which may be granted under this rule will be restricted to such period as the Government granting it is satisfied is actually necessary with reference to the urgency of the case.\n\nIX. Officers and Warrant Officers proceeding on furlough to Europe may, if they desire it, receive an advance equivalent to three months' furlough pay.\n\nX. Leave may be granted for any period not exceeding six months at a time, and may not, except for very urgent reasons, to be specially reported to the Government of India, be renewed till after six months have elapsed from its expiration. It must be spent at some place east of the 40th degree of east longitude. Subject to these conditions, it may be granted or refused entirely at the discretion of the local authorities, who in granting it shall fix its duration, and may fix the limits within which it shall be spent, and whether during its continuance half-pay and allowances are to be deducted for the payment of a substitute; and they may grant it as preparatory to furlough, or for the purpose of a medical examination. Leave counts as service for pension and furlough. The local authorities shall be defined for the purpose of this rule by the Government of India.\n\nXI. Leave and furlough are reckoned from and to the close of the days named in the order granting them.\n\nNote.\u2014From and after the 17th November, 1883, the day on which the vessel on which an officer proceeds on furlough quits her moorings or anchorage, whether she leaves the limits of the port or not on that day, will be reckoned as the date of the commencement of his furlough, and as a day of the furlough; and the date, on which the vessel on which he returns to India drops her anchor or is moored at any Indian port, will be reckoned as a day of duty. An officer's furlough begins on the vessel's departure from any Indian port at which he first joins her, and ends on the day before her arrival at the port at which he last quits her.\n\nXII. The position of Officers not included in Schedule A will be unchanged as respects leave or furlough.\n\nXIII. Officers now in the service placing themselves, from a given date, under these rules, shall count service for pension up to that date under the rules to which they were then subject.\n\nNote.\u2014An officer takes with him so much service for pension as he had become entitled to under former rules.\n\nWhen, however, officers joining the Staff Corps have joined with less than 20 years' service under the rules of 1854 or 1868, before coming under these rules, they shall, after completing 20 years' service in all, be permitted to count as service for pension a proportion of any furlough or leave which they may have taken under earlier rules, at the rate of two years' leave for 30 years' service, or one-tenth. Thus, an officer who, before coming under the rules of 1875, had a service of 14 years and 99 days, of which 2 years 142 days were on leave under the rules of 1868, would count one year and 156 days' leave, and would have 13 years 113 days' total service for pension.\n\n* Rulings contained in G.G.O. No. 1,110 of 27 Oct., 1876.\n\u2020 Rulings contained in G.G.O.

No. 1,110 of 27 Oct., 1876.\n\u00b6 For advances on return to duty See page lxxxii.\nSCHEDULE A.\n\nOfficers entering the Staff Corps or Indian Medical Service, and Warrant Officers attaining that rank, after the 31st December, 1875; and\n\nAny other officers, Commissioned or Warrant, belonging to the Indian Army or Medical Service, or Officers of the Staff Corps, who, after the 31st of December, 1875, shall, before asking for leave or furlough, apply in writing to their local Government to be placed definitively upon this Schedule; but their service for furlough under Rule I shall commence from the date of such entry or such application respectively.\n\nNote 1.\u2014The date of entry into the Staff Corps is that of entry for choice of furlough rules, viz., the date on which the Officer was originally appointed on probation. An Officer, therefore, whose date of admission to the Staff Corps is not after the 31st December, 1875, will have the choice of rules, but an Officer whose date of admission is after that date will have no option.\n\nNote 2.\u2014Officers compulsorily placed under these regulations on entering the Staff Corps, will be allowed to count their previous military service in India towards furlough, provided they shall have served five years in India, of which not less than half shall have been in the Staff Corps; but any leave out of India on private affairs taken by them during service so counted will be reckoned as furlough taken under Rule I, and any leave taken on medical certificate will be reckoned as taken under Rule VI.\n\nShould, therefore, an officer, who took sick leave out of India whilst in the British service, again require leave on medical certificate on his admission to the Staff Corps, and proceed under Rule VI, he will be granted, in the first instance, only so much furlough as will complete the period admissible under that rule. This furlough may be extended to two years on \"English furlough pay,\" but it will rest with Her Majesty's Government to determine whether any, and if so, what, extension shall be granted.\n\nNote 3.\u2014Warrant Officers promoted to that grade after the 31st December, 1875, and thus compulsorily brought under these rules, will be allowed to count their previous service for furlough under Rule VI; but furlough is not to be granted under this rule until a Warrant Officer has completed two years' service since his last return to duty from furlough as a Non-Commissioned Officer, otherwise he can only be granted leave under the note to Rule VI.\n\nNote 4.\u2014An Officer electing these regulations, and having furlough to his credit under previous rules, forfeits such furlough absolutely, he being required to serve five years from date of such election to entitle him to one year's furlough, unless it be sick furlough. An Officer similarly circumstanced, but having furlough to his debit, is equally with the others entitled to take one year's furlough five years after electing the new rules.\n\nAny Officers in civil employment declared by the Government of India to be under civil leave rules shall not be under these rules.\n\n** The last pay certificate issued to an Officer to whom furlough or leave has been granted shall state the pay to which, under Rule V., he is at that date entitled in respect to the office he is holding, noticing the date, if any fixed, at which he will vacate it.\n\nSUBSIDIARY RULES.\n\nWith adventance to the foregoing rules, the Right Honorable the Governor-General in Council is pleased to notify\u2014\n\nI. That no \"extra or special allowances\" drawn by an officer, which are now excluded from the account in calculating furlough pay under the Rules of 1868, can be reckoned in calculating furlough pay under these Rules (Rule V.).\n\nII. That the Governments of the three Presidencies, or their Excellencies the Commanders-in-Chief, in regard to Officers serving directly under them, shall be held to be the \"local authorities\" named in Rule X.\n\nIII. That, pending further orders, a Staff Officer granted leave under Rule X. shall receive, as heretofore, the pay or staff corps pay of his rank, and half the staff salary of his appointment during such leave; but full staff salary may be allowed him for the first two months (as now during privilege leave) when he makes approved arrangements for the performance of his duties during that period. In such cases the G. O. granting the leave must state that the first two months are to be on full staff pay.\n\n\u2020 (2). The leave up to sixty days in each year on full Staff pay under the foregoing rule may be taken either for the full time or by instalments, in the same way as privilege leave under other furlough rules is taken, the condition that six months must elapse between the return of an officer to duty and the grant of a fresh period of leave not being enforced in respect of such leave of absence.\n\nNote 1.\u2014Privilege leave for 90 days, after 33 months' duty, which may be spent anywhere in or out of India, is admissible to Commissioned and Warrant Officers under these rules; but to claim the privilege it shall be necessary for an officer to show that he has had no leave on full Indian pay and allowances for 33 months previous to the date of his application, and that he has made satisfactory arrangements for the performance of his duties during his absence, at no additional cost to the State. If leave for a shorter period than 90 days is taken, the balance is forfeited.\n\nNote 2.\u2014Officers are not required to report themselves to the India Office should they go to England; but it will be incumbent on them to keep their departmental superiors in India acquainted with their address.\n\nNote 3.\u2014No furlough or leave out of India, if exceeding six months, can be counted as part of the required 33 months' duty; but an officer who may have 33 months' service at credit before proceeding on such furlough or leave (in excess of six months) may be allowed to take accumulated privilege leave on his return, if he can be spared.\n\nNote 4.\u2014Warrant Officers proceeding out of India on privilege leave under Note 1 must deposit the amount of their return passage money, or give security for the payment of the same.\n\nNote 5.\u2014General Officers Commanding Divisions, Districts and Brigades are not eligible for the 90 days' privilege leave referred to in the above Note 1.\n\nNote 6.\u2014The \"Staff Officers\" referred to in the above Rule III. apply to regimental as well as Departmental Staff.\n\nN.B.\u2014It is distinctly to be understood that the rule regarding the pay to be drawn on leave under Rule X. is liable to be modified at any time in any way that the Government of India may deem expedient.\n\nIV. Pending further orders these rules are not applicable to any Officer in civil employ.\n\n7th December, 1877.\n\nNo. 1,102 of 1877.\u2014His Excellency the Governor General in Council is pleased to notify the following supplementary regulations, which have received the approval of the Right Honourable the Secretary of State for India, providing for the case of Military Officers in Civil employ, referred to in paragraph IV. of the subsidiary rules appended to G.G.O. No. 1,316 of the 30th December, 1875:\n\nI. Any Officer now in Civil employ, who is subject to the Military Furlough Regulations of 1854 or 1868 shall remain so subject.\n\nII. Any Military Officer who may hereafter enter Civil employ, who is not already subject to the Military Furlough and Leave Rules of 1875, shall remain subject to the rules applicable to him when he enters Civil employ.\n\nNote.\u2014An Officer referred to in Rules I. and II. cannot elect the Military Furlough and Leave Rules of 1875, so long as he continues in Civil employ.\n\n\u2022 Rulings contained in G.G.O. No. 23 of 10 Jan., 1879.\n\u2020 Army Circulars, India, Jan., 1883, Clause 12.\nIII. Any Officer who may enter Civil employ, who is already subject to the Military Furlough and Leave Rules of 1875, shall be subject to the rules in the Civil Leave Code applicable to covenanted civil servants, both as regards furlough and leave taken out of India and in India.\n\nIV. If any Officer, who is employed in the civil administration, has taken furlough in the Military Department under the said rules of 1875, this furlough shall be treated, in calculating the furlough or special leave admissible to him under the preceding rule, as if it had been furlough taken under the Civil Leave Code. Leave so taken under the 10th Military Rule shall be treated as if it had been privilege leave taken under the Civil Leave Code, and the claims of the Officer under the Civil Leave Code adjusted accordingly.\n\nV. If an Officer, who has been subject to the rules in the Civil Leave Code under the third of these rules, is again employed in the Military Department, and so again becomes subject to the Military Furlough and Leave Rules of 1875, any furlough or special leave taken by him under the Civil Leave Code will be treated in calculating the furlough admissible to him under the said military rules as if it had been furlough taken under the said military rules. Privilege leave taken under the Civil Leave Code Rules will be treated as if it had been leave taken under the 10th Military Rule. Subsidiary or examination leave taken under the Civil Leave Code will not affect the claims of such an Officer under the Military Furlough and Leave Rules.\n\n---\n\n**LEAVE RULES FOR THE INDIAN STAFF CORPS.**\n\n*(Published in Army Circulars, India, 16 April, 1886.)*\n\n1. An officer may be granted, \u2014\n   Privilege leave under such regulations as may from time to time be in force.\n   Leave out of India, for no longer period than one year, capable of extension to two years' absence from duty, on the following pay: \u2014\n\n   After appointment to the Staff Corps \u00a3200 a year.\n   After the commencement of the 5th years' service for pension ... 250 \"\n   Ditto, ditto, 15th ditto, ditto, ditto ... 300 \"\n   Ditto, ditto, 20th ditto, ditto, ditto ... 450 \"\n   Ditto, ditto, 25th ditto, ditto, ditto ... 600 \"\n   Ditto, ditto, 30th ditto, ditto, ditto ... 700 \"\n\n   Leave in India, but for the period of one year only, on full military pay and half the Staff salary of appointment.\n\n2. No extension of leave involving absence from duty for more than two years, whether taken in or out of India, can be granted except on specially urgent grounds and without pay.\n\n3. An officer, unable on account of the state of his health to return to duty within the maximum period of two years' absence, will, unless he is under Rule 2 specially granted an extension of leave without pay, be placed on temporary half pay or the retired list, as the circumstances of the case may seem to require. An officer will also be liable to be placed on half pay or the retired list should his health require an undue amount of leave, whether in or out of India. This power will be exercised at the instance of the Government of his own Presidency should the officer be in India, or, should he be at home, by the Secretary of State in Council.\n\n4. All leave in or out of India will count as service for pension.\n\n5. Leave, whether it is leave in India or leave out of India, will not involve forfeiture of appointment, and may be granted at any time, but solely at the discretion of the Commanders-in-Chief of the several armies for officers serving directly under their orders, and by the Governor-General in Council or the Governors in Council for officers of civil departments of the Army, or of Corps not under the direct orders of a Commander-in-Chief.\n\n6. An officer on leave, whether in India or out of India, will be required to rejoin at once on being recalled to duty, unless certified by a Medical Board as unfit to do so.\n\n7. The above rules shall apply to \u2014\n   Officers whose admission to the Staff Corps shall bear date subsequent to the 30th June 1886.\n   Officers of the Staff Corps, including probationers, or of the Cavalry and Infantry list, of the Indian Army, in military employment, who may elect them within twelve months of that date. Officers applying for leave of any kind within that period must elect on making their application. Officers already on leave at date of promulgation must elect at once, and the new rules will apply to them from the date on which their notification of acceptance shall be received at either army headquarters or by the Government of India, or by the Local Governments, or at the India Office at home, as the case may be.\n\n   Officers in civil employ on that date, subsequently reverting to military duty, who may elect them within six months from the date of being replaced at the disposal of the Military Department, and such officers who may be on leave when so replaced must make their election at once. Those taking leave within the six months must make their election before going on leave.\n\n   They shall not apply to \u2014\n   Officers in permanent civil employ.\n   Officers commanding divisions, districts, or brigades, or holding other appointments under special regulations as to leave of absence, who will continue subject to such regulations.\n\n8. Officers who, under Rule 7, elect to come under them will count all previous leave as service for pension. The position of those who do not so elect will remain unchanged.\n\n9. The Secretary of State in Council reserves the right of making any change in the foregoing regulations which circumstances may require.\n\n**INDIAN MEDICAL SERVICE.**\n\nThe above rules apply equally to officers of the Indian Medical Service in military employ, with the following modification in regard to the rates of pay whilst on leave out of India: \u2014\n\n   After arrival in India ... \u00a3200 a year.\n   After the commencement of the 5th year's service for pension ... 250 \"\n   Ditto, ditto, 10th ditto ... 300 \"\n   Ditto, ditto, 15th ditto ... 400 \"\n   Ditto, ditto, 20th ditto ... 450 \"\n   Ditto, ditto, 25th ditto ... 500 \"\n\n   The rules will apply to all Medical Officers admitted to the Service after the 30th June 1886, and to officers who may elect them under the provisions of Rule 7.\n\n---\n\n*India Army Circulars, June, 1887, Clause 90.*\n\nWith reference to Rule VII, and Clause 2 of Rule IX. of the leave rules for the Staff Corps published in Clause 51, India Army Circulars, 1886, it is notified that any officer in military employment (including medical officers), whose election of leave rules shall not have been received by the 1st July, 1887, will be held to have finally declined those rules.\nDECISIONS ON THE LEAVE RULES FOR THE STAFF CORPS.\n\n(Published in India Army Circulars,* subsequently to the promulgation of the Rules.)\n\n1. Officers in permanent civil employment, while they continue in such employment, are not affected by these rules; but if desirous of retiring on pension direct from such employment, they will, whether on duty or on furlough, be given the benefit of the rule which allows all previous leave to count as service for pension.\n\nIt is, however, to be clearly understood that no officer in civil employment will be allowed to place himself out of employment for the purpose of taking leave under these rules, or for any purpose but immediate retirement.\n\n2. There is no subsidiary leave under these rules. Leave under them commences from the date of an officer's being struck off duty, and terminates on the date he rejoins his regiment or appointment, the only exception being in case of leave out of India recommended by a Medical Board, when the period granted is held to commence from the date of the officer's quitting India, and to terminate on, and include, the date previous to that of his rejoining his regiment or appointment. But under any circumstances the absence from duty, which is restricted to two years with pay (Rule 2), will reckon from the date of an officer being struck off duty.\n\n3. When leave \"in and out of India\" is granted to an officer on medical certificate in continuation of leave \"in India,\" the former will reckon from the date of termination of the latter, subject to the limit of two years' absence from duty.\n\n4. The term \"date of being struck off duty\" is intended to mean the date following the day an officer is relieved of his duties. But in the case of an officer obliged to leave his station to appear before a Medical Board at another station, the date of being \"struck off duty\" will mean the date he is permitted to quit the station where he is examined and invalided.\n\nUp to date of leaving India, and from date of return to India to date of rejoining regiment or appointment, officers granted leave out of India under these rules will receive Indian pay and half staff salary, provided in any case the two years' absence from duty mentioned in Rule 2 (p. lxxxi.) is not exceeded.\n\n5. The Indian Pension Regulations are unaffected by these leave rules, except that all leave from date of commencement of service for pension will, under them, be allowed to count as service for pension.\n\n6. Time passed at Addiscombe after the attainment of the age of 16 years will reckon as service for pension in calculating the rates of pay under Rule I.\n\n7. The periods of service for pension in Rule I, of the leave rules will entitle an officer taking leave to the pay fixed for such periods of service, without any limitation based on the rule which prevents an officer from retiring on the pension fixed for a particular period of service, unless he has served half of that service in the Staff Corps.\n\n8. The provisions of the rules with regard to duration of leave do not apply to probationers for the Staff Corps.\n\n9. The limit of two years laid down for leave will not apply to time spent at the Staff College, which counts as duty.\n\n10. Officers recalled from leave granted under these rules will be given free passage to India, or not, according to the Transport Regulations in force at the time.\n\n11. Advances of pay to officers proceeding on and returning from leave out of India will be granted as heretofore.\n\n12.

Officers admitted to the service after August, 1889, are not eligible for these pensions. They are offered yearly irrotation to Surgeons-Major-General, Surgeon-Colonels, and to all Brigade Surgeon-Lieut.-Colonels; but under no circumstances is the extra pension given to a Surgeon-Major-General or Surgeon-Colonel until he has completed three years' actual service in the grade, excluding all leave except privilege leave, and then only when from failing health or other unforeseen causes he may be unable to complete his full tour of service. Applications for these pensions must be made to the Surgeons-Major-General with the Government of India, Madras, and Bombay respectively, on or before the 1st April in each year.

Service for pension (except as shown in the following paragraphs) commences from date of arrival in India and includes all leave and furlough taken after that date.\n\n15. Officers who were appointed from Addiscombe count the period passed at the seminary after attaining the age of 16 years.\n\n16. Medical Officers appointed before 1st Jan., 1891, count as service the period passed at the Army Medical School. Those appointed since 1st January, 1891, reckon service for pension from the date of leaving the Army Medical School.\n\n17. Officers appointed to the Staff Corps from the British Service are allowed to count service out of India before joining the Staff Corps, to an extent not exceeding two years in any case.\n\n18. Officers who have entered the Staff Corps from the British Service only become entitled to pension after one of the fixed periods specified when not less than one half of the period has been passed in the Staff Corps.\n\n19.

Under the Furlough Regulations of 1875, all leave within Indian limits, and all furlough earned by length of service (i.e., one year for every five years' service in India,) reckon as service.\n\n22. Under certain conditions, leave rendered necessary by wounds or by illness solely contracted on field service is allowed to reckon as service.\n\n23. No deduction on account of leave of absence is made from the periods of service for the additional pensions specified in paragraph 1.\n\nCOMMUTATION OF PENSION.\n\n24. An Officer retiring under the above regulations will be allowed, under certain conditions,* to commute a portion, not exceeding one-third, of his pension, which commutation may take place on retirement or at any time subsequent thereto.\n\nWARRANT OFFICERS.\n\n(These rules took effect from the 1st Sept., 1881.)\n\n1. All Warrant Officers on the Establishment on 16th September, 1881, are allowed the option of electing the old or the new scale of pensions at any time previous to retirement.

An Officer in Europe desirous of commuting must make application, in writing, to the Under Secretary of State for India, stating his desire so to commute, and furnishing information as to his age, rank, and the amount of his pension.\n\n4. If the Secretary of State for India in Council shall approve the commutation, the Officer will be so informed, and his application will be forwarded to the Standing Medical Board at the India Office.\n\n5. The Board will require the Officer to give such information as to his health and habits as is usual in the case of persons proposing to assure their lives in assurance companies, and he will be required to submit himself for personal examination by the Board at the India Office.\n\n6. An Officer in India desirous of commuting must address the authorities of his Presidency. He will be required to go through similar forms, Boards, which will, when practicable, be presided over by the chief Civil Medical Administrative Officer of the Government, being formed in the Presidency towns of Calcutta, Madras, and Bombay, under orders of the respective Governments.\n\n7. The basis of commutation, subject to an addition of years of age in the case of impaired lives, shall be the following table, the age of the Officer being reckoned at the age he will attain on the birthday next succeeding the date upon which the capitalised sum will become payable:\u2014\n### CONDITIONS OF TRANSFER TO TEMPORARY HALF-PAY.\n\n**COMMISSIONED OFFICERS.**\n\n(Sanctioned by Despatch of Government of India, No. 432, dated 22nd December, 1881.)\n\nOfficers placed on temporary half-pay, at the recommendation of the Medical Board of the India Office, shall be examined by the same Board as to their fitness to return to duty every two years, and if still reported unfit at the third examination, that is, after being six years on the temporary half-pay list, they shall be transferred to the retired list on permanent half-pay. An Officer reported to be unfit at the commencement of the second period, i.e., after two years on half-pay, may, however, be permitted voluntarily to retire on permanent half-pay.\n\nOfficers unable to appear before the Medical Board at the stated times will be required to furnish a certificate, signed by two medical men, as to their inability. An Officer who is continuously unable to appear will be retired permanently after six years without further report.\n\nOfficers who, in view to being restored to the active list, may wish to appear before the Board at other times than those specified, may be permitted to do so. Officers ordered periodically to appear before the Board will receive their travelling expenses and lodging allowance on the Home scale, but those appearing at other times, at their own wish, must do so at their own expense.\n\n**WARRANT OFFICERS.**\n\n(Sanctioned by Despatch to Government of India, No. 25, dated 24th January, 1884.)\n\nA Warrant Officer transferred to temporary half-pay may be permitted to remain on half-pay till his total continuous absence from duty, on furlough and half-pay together, amounts to four years. If then still unfit to return to duty, he must be pensioned on the rate of pension for which he had qualified at the time of being placed on half-pay.\n\nNo period spent on half-pay will count as service for Indian pension, nor will a Warrant Officer be eligible for promotion while he is on half-pay. A Warrant Officer replaced on the effective list, on return to duty from half-pay, will be re-employed at once, being borne as a supernumerary in his grade until absorbed by the next vacancy.\nWarrant Officers will be required to appear before a Medical Board at the expiration of one year on half-pay and again, if retained on the half-pay list, at the end of the second year; and those who, in view to being restored to the effective list, may wish to appear before the Board at other times than those specified, may be permitted to do so. Warrant Officers ordered periodically to appear before the Board will be allowed, in this country, their bona fide travelling expenses, and lodging allowance at the rates stated below, but those appearing at other times, and at their own wish, must do so at their own expense.\n\nRates of Lodging Allowance.\n\n| Rank                                      | Rate          |\n|-------------------------------------------|---------------|\n| Deputy Commissary                         | 2s. 3d. per diem |\n| Senior Apothecary after 3 years' service in the 1st grade |               |\n| Assistant Commissary                      |               |\n| Deputy Assistant Commissary               | 2s.           |\n| Senior Apothecary under 3 years' service in the 1st grade |               |\n| Conductor                                 |               |\n| Sub-Conductor                             |               |\n| Medical Warrant Officers below the rank of Senior Apothecary | 1s. 4d.       |\n\nVICTORIA R.

A diminished pension cannot, however, be granted of a lower amount than \u00a310. This modification of the old rule has effect from 18 February, 1890.\n\n5. The pensions continue only during widowhood.\n\n6. Pensions lapsing on re-marriage are not restored on a second widowhood.\n\n7. Pensioners neglecting to claim the pension for three half-years will be considered as dead, and no arrears for a longer period than two years back from the date of application for admission or re-admission, as the case may be, will be allowed either to claimants or to pensioners after admission.\n\n8. The widows of officers formerly of the Indian service, who have joined the British army, retain their claims to pension from this Fund.\n\n9. The widows of officers who have retired from the service are not eligible to the benefits of this Fund.*\n\n* Except in the case of the widows of General Officers compulsorily retired under the provisions of the Royal Warrants of 31st December 1877, 1st May 1878, 25th June 1881, 11th March 1882, and 16th June 1884.\n10.

Furlough not taken at the time it becomes due is not lost, and can, subject to these regulations be taken later.\n\nII.\u2014An officer may not be absent from duty on any grounds for more than three years consecutively, nor on return from furlough may he receive, except under Rule VII., any further furlough until after an interval of three years.\n\nIII.\u2014Furlough may be spent anywhere, and, when it has been earned by length of service, counts as service for pension. Furlough taken before it is earned by length of service reckons against service for pension till paid off.\n\nIV.\u2014An officer on furlough receives half the pay of his rank, or, if holding a shore appointment, half the pay of his appointment excluding command, charge, acting, personal, or house allowance, computed according to a rate of exchange to be fixed in each year by the Secretary of State. An officer promoted while on furlough will be entitled to a moiety of the increased pay due to that promotion.\n\nV.\u2014An officer proceeding on or returning from furlough may be granted an advance of three months' furlough pay; and he may further be granted the advance in aid of passage money specified in clause IX., if he does not obtain passage by troopship. Advances made in England will be recovered in India by monthly instalments of one-fourth of the pay drawn by the officers. Advances made in India will be noted on the last pay certificates of officers, and no issue of furlough pay will be made till after the sum advanced has accrued as furlough pay.\n\nVI.\u2014Furlough pay may not be drawn for more than two years consecutively.\n\nVII.\u2014Upon certificate of a medical board, an officer not entitled to furlough, who has served not less than one year in India, may be granted furlough. Such furlough will not count as service for pension until it has been served in accordance with the terms of Rule I. Furlough cannot be anticipated beyond two years in the aggregate, nor for a second term, unless that previously anticipated has been subsequently paid off under the terms of Rule I.\n\nVIII.\u2014An officer who has exhausted the furlough obtainable under these rules, and who may be certified by a medical board to be still unfit for duty, will be retired on the pension or gratuity to which he may be entitled; if not entitled to either pension or gratuity, his case will be specially considered (but see under heading \"Temporary Retirement,\" on p. lxxxvi).\n\nIX.\u2014Marine officers not holding shore appointments of Rs. 1,000 per mensem will be eligible for the grant of non-regulation passages in troopships when such passages are available. Officers who do not obtain passage in troopships will be allowed advances in aid of passage-money, in addition to the advances admissible under Clause V., provided that no officer shall in any case draw advances exceeding three months' pay in all.\n\nX.\u2014Furlough, whether on private affairs or on medical certificate, is restricted to a maximum period of one year in the first instance, and to subsequent extensions not exceeding six months at a time.\n\nGeneral Leave.\n\nXI.\u2014General leave may be granted for any period not exceeding six months at a time, but cannot be renewed, except for very urgent reasons, till after two years have elapsed from its expiration.

It may be granted up to a maximum limit of 30 days as subsidiary to furlough, whether on proceeding on furlough or on return from furlough. Leave granted as subsidiary to furlough can only be spent in India.\n\nXII.\u2014During general leave an officer will be restricted to the pay of his grade,* and will forfeit all allowances, which will be paid to his locum tenens. If an officer exceeds the six months' leave admissible at one time under this rule, the entire period will be converted into furlough, and his allowances adjusted accordingly.\n\nPrivilege Leave.\n\nXIII.\u2014Subject to the exigencies of the service, Marine officers may be allowed 60 days' privilege leave during each year, and such leave may be taken in instalments.\n\nXIV.\u2014An officer who has privilege leave to his credit when proceeding on leave or furlough does not forfeit it, but privilege leave cannot be taken in continuation of furlough, nor can furlough be obtained in continuation of privilege leave. Privilege leave may, however, be converted into general leave with the sanction of the Director of the Indian Marine, or into furlough with the sanction of the Government of India.\n\nXV.\u2014Privilege leave will be granted by the Director of the Indian Marine, but it will be granted only on the understanding that no additional expense is thereby caused to the State either directly or indirectly, that the applicant's services can be spared, and that satisfactory arrangements for the performance of his duties during his absence can be made.\n\nXVI.\u2014Officers are at liberty to proceed wherever they may desire when on privilege leave, provided they can ensure their return before the expiration of the leave. If an officer exceeds his privilege leave, the whole period of his absence will be converted into general leave or furlough, and his allowances and statement of service for furlough adjusted accordingly.\n\nTemporary Leave.\n\nXVII.\u2014Temporary leave not exceeding 10 days, and not in anticipation or in extension of any other kind of leave or furlough, may be granted by the Director and Deputy Director of the Indian Marine.\n\nXVIII.\u2014Temporary leave not exceeding 72 hours may be granted by commanders of vessels and heads of departments to officers under their command.\n\nGeneral Regulations.\n\nXIX.\u2014It must be distinctly understood that furlough or leave cannot be claimed as a right. Both are subject to the exigencies of the public service, and will be granted only when an officer's services can be spared. Commanders of vessels and heads of departments will not forward an application for furlough or leave unless they are able to satisfy the Director of the Indian Marine that the officer's services can be spared without any inconvenience to the public service.\n\nXX.\u2014No grant of leave given under the conditions of these rules will count against an officer's service for pension, and leave may be spent anywhere, i.e., within possible limits of return before it expires.\n\nXXI.\u2014Leave is reckoned from the day on which an officer avails himself of it, and it expires on the day he rejoins.\n\nFurlough reckons from date of leaving India or from date of leaving his ship if at an outstation, unless specially stated by authority to commence on an earlier date; and in the event of an officer returning to India before the expiration of his furlough, it ceases on the date of his return.\n\nThe day of return, whether from leave or from furlough, is a day of duty.\n\nXXII.\u2014Officers on furlough will draw their pay from the India Office, but officers on general or privilege leave must arrange to draw their pay in India.\n\nXXIII.\u2014As a rule, leave will be granted only during the period of the south-west monsoon.\n\nXXIV.\u2014Officers proceeding on furlough will report their departure personally at the office of the Director or Deputy Director of the Indian Marine, except when they avail themselves of it at an outstation. An officer returning from furlough or leave will rejoin the ship to which he belongs; but if this is impracticable, and he has not received instructions (which he should apply for beforehand), he will rejoin at Bombay or Calcutta, reporting himself in person to the Director or Deputy Director. On the departure of an officer on furlough or leave, or on the return of an officer therefrom, the commander of the vessel will cause an entry to be made of the date in the ship's log book, and will forward an extract thereof by the next post to the Director.\n\nXXV.\u2014Officers arriving in Europe on furlough or on general leave must report their arrival in writing to the Military Secretary at the India Office, and state their address; and for extension of furlough or for permission to return to duty, they must also apply to the Military Secretary. Before applying for extension of furlough on private affairs, they must obtain permission to do so from the Government of India, through the Director of Marine. The permission thus obtained must be attached to the application for extension, and submitted to the Military Secretary at the India Office.\n\nOfficers proceeding to the Colonies on furlough should apply to India for extensions of furlough and for permission to return to duty.\n\nXXVI.\u2014During the absence of an officer on leave or furlough, he must keep the Director of the Indian Marine acquainted with his actual address, and be prepared to return immediately to India, should his services be required. When on leave, such recall order will be issued by the Director; when on furlough in Europe, by the Secretary of State. Officers spending their furlough in Europe must keep the Secretary of State informed of their address.\n\nXXVII.\u2014Applications for leave or furlough must be made on the authorized form, which is obtainable from the Director or Deputy Director of the Indian Marine.\n\nNote.\u2014(Marine Circular No. 10 of 1885.)\n\nThe above rules are applicable to\u2014\n\nI.\u2014Officers on the Graded and Supernumerary List of Executive Officers.\n\nII.\u2014Officers on the Graded List of Engineers.\n\nIII.\u2014Gazetted clerks.\n\nIV.\u2014Warrant officers who may be specially admitted to the Rules.\n\n* This rule will also hold good in the case of an officer holding a shore appointment, in which case the balance will be considered a staff allowance payable to the locum tenens, provided the latter does not thereby draw more than the p.v of the appointment.\n\n\u2020 Marine Circular No. 19 of 1888.\n\n\u2021 Marine Circular No. 3 of 1889.\nMARINE CIRCULAR OF THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA, No. 7 of 1892.\n\nWith reference to Marine Circular No. 16 of the 1st November, 1884, the Governor-General in Council is pleased, under instructions from Her Majesty's Secretary of State for India, to publish the following revised rules regarding the grant of leave to officers of the Royal Indian Marine.\n\n2. These rules shall apply to\u2014\n\n(a) All officers appointed to the Indian Marine after the date of their publication.\n(b) Officers who may elect them within one year of the date of their publication.\n\nNote.\u2014The term \"officers\" includes the Graded and Supernumerary List of Executive Officers and the Graded List of Engineers.\n\n3. Those who apply for leave of any kind within one year of the date of publication of these rules must make their election when submitting their applications for leave; all others, whether on duty or on furlough or leave on the date of publication of these rules, may elect at convenient times within the specified time.\n\n4. All officers who elect these rules will count under their provisions from the date of the receipt of their applications by the Government of India if they are in India, or at the India Office if they are at home; and they will be entitled to count all past furlough and leave as service for pension under Rule V.\n\n5. Those who elect these rules while on furlough or general leave under the previous regulations will be allowed the option of continuing to draw any furlough or leave allowances they may be in receipt of under those regulations, if more advantageous, until the expiry of such furlough or general leave or any extension thereof which would have been admissible under the previous regulations, subject to the limit of two years' absence from duty.\n\n6. It must be clearly understood that officers who do not elect these rules within the period stated will be held to have declined them, and will be allowed no further opportunity of electing them.\n\n7. \"General leave\" and \"subsidiary leave\" will not be granted to officers under these rules.\n\nRules.\n\nI. An officer subject to these rules may be granted\u2014\n\n(a) Privilege leave and temporary leave under such regulations as may from time to time be in force.\n(b) Leave in or out of India for one year, capable of extension to two years' absence from duty under conditions stated below.\n\nLeave in or out of India other than privilege or temporary leave.\n\nII. During leave in or out of India other than privilege or temporary leave, the following rates of pay will be drawn, whether an officer holds a shore appointment or not:\n\n| Commanders, 1st Grade | Rs. per mensem. |\n|-----------------------|-----------------|\n|                       | 410             |\n| 2nd Grade             | 330             |\n| 3rd Grade             | 230             |\n| 1st Grade officers of six years' seniority | 210 |\n| 1st Grade officers of three years' seniority | 170 |\n| under ditto           | 150             |\n| 2nd Grade officers    | 120             |\n| 3rd Grade officers    | 110             |\n| Chief Engineers on Rs. 400 per mensem | 320 |\n| on Rs. 300 per mensem | 270             |\n| Engineers on Rs. 250  | 230             |\n| on Rs. 225            | 215             |\n| on Rs. 200            | 200             |\n| on Rs. 175            | 190             |\n| Assistant Engineers on Rs. 150 | 165 |\n| on Rs. 125            | 150             |\n\nAn officer promoted while on leave will be entitled to the higher rate of leave pay from date of promotion.\n\nIII. Leave may be granted at any time at the discretion of the Government of India, on the recommendation of the Director of the Royal Indian Marine.\n\nIV. Extensions of leave in or out of India in excess of one year, but not exceeding two years' absence from duty in all, may be granted on medical certificate or on special or urgent grounds, at the discretion of the sanctioning authority. The previous assent of the Government of India will be required for extensions except on medical certificate, and must be obtained by the applicant through the Director of the Royal Indian Marine. Extensions beyond two years' absence from duty will only be admissible in very special cases, and without any pay whatever.\n\nV. Leave in or out of India will reckon as service for pension.\n\nVI. Leave will commence on the date of being struck off duty, except that in the case of an officer having to appear before a Medical Board the date of being struck off duty will mean the date on which he quits the station where he is examined and invalided. In cases of leave out of India on medical certificate the period of leave recommended by a Medical Board as necessary will be held to commence on the date of quitting India. In all cases, however, an officer will be due to rejoin his ship or appointment at the expiry of the period granted to him, the day on which he rejoins it being reckoned as a day of duty.\n\nVII. An officer unable on account of ill health to return to his duty within the maximum period of two years' absence will, unless specially granted leave without pay, be placed on temporary or permanent retirement, according to the circumstances of his case. An undue amount of leave on account of ill health will likewise render an officer liable to be transferred to temporary or permanent retirement.\n\nVIII. An officer on leave in or out of India will be required to rejoin his appointment at once on being recalled to duty on account of the exigencies of the service, unless pronounced by a Medical Board to be unfit to do so.\n\nIX. An officer proceeding on leave will report his departure personally at the office of the Director or Deputy Director of the Royal Indian Marine, except when he avails himself of it at an out-station. Except when ordered to the contrary, all officers returning from leave will report themselves to the Director of the Royal Indian Marine at Bombay.\n\nAn officer arriving in Europe on leave must report his arrival in writing to the Military Secretary at the India Office, and state his address; and for extension of leave, or for permission to return to duty, he must also apply to the Military Secretary. An officer applying for extension of leave on private affairs must,\nexcept in very special or urgent circumstances, attach an intimation of the assent of the Government of India.\n\nAn officer proceeding to the Colonies on leave should apply to India for extensions of leave and for permission to return to duty.\n\nX. Leave pay under these rules, when issued out of India, will be converted into sterling at the official rate of exchange in force for the period when the pay becomes due, as fixed annually for the adjustment of financial transactions between the Indian and Imperial Governments.\n\nXI. Advances not exceeding three months' full pay of grade, subject to a limit of \u00a3100 to Commanders, and \u00a365 to officers of junior rank, will be allowed on proceeding on or returning from leave, and on returning from temporary retirement. Advances made in England will be recovered in India by monthly instalments of one-fourth of the pay drawn by the officers. Advances made in India will be noted on the last pay certificates of officers, and no issue of leave pay will be made till the sum advanced has accrued as such. In case of death no recovery of advances made under this rule is to be effected from the estate of the deceased officer.\n\nXII. Marine officers not holding shore appointments of Rs. 1,000 per mensem will be eligible for the grant of non-regulation passages in troopships when such passages are available.\n\nPrivilege and temporary leave under these rules.\n\nXIII. Subject to the exigencies of the service, Marine officers may be allowed sixty days' privilege leave during each year, and such leave may be taken in instalments.\n\nXIV. Accumulated privilege leave for ninety days may be granted to an officer who has no privilege leave during the preceding thirty-three months, but no \"leave in or out of India,\" if exceeding six months, can be counted as part of the fixed thirty-three months.\n\nXV. An officer who has privilege leave (ordinary or accumulated) at his credit, when proceeding on \"leave in or out of India,\" does not forfeit it, but privilege leave cannot be taken in continuation of \"leave in or out of India\" nor can \"leave in or out of India\" be taken in continuation of privilege leave.\n\nPrivilege leave may, however, be converted into \"leave in or out of India\" with the sanction of the Government of India.\n\nXVI. An officer returning from accumulated privilege leave granted in one year and extending into the next is eligible for ordinary privilege leave during the period when such leave is available in the year in which he returns, provided he rejoins before proceeding on ordinary privilege leave.\n\nXVII. Privilege leave will be granted by the Director of the Royal Indian Marine, but only on the understanding that no additional expense is thereby caused to the State either directly or indirectly, that the applicant's services can be spared and that satisfactory arrangements for the performance of his duties during his absence can be made.\n\nXVIII. Privilege leave (ordinary or accumulated) reckons as service for pension.\n\nXIX. As a rule privilege leave will only be granted during the period of the south-west monsoon.\n\nXX. Officers are at liberty to proceed wherever they may desire when on privilege leave, provided they can ensure their return before the expiration of the leave. If an officer exceeds his privilege leave the whole period of his absence will be converted into \"leave in or out of India\" and his allowances and statement of service for \"leave in or out of India\" adjusted accordingly.\n\nXXI. Privilege leave is reckoned from the day on which an officer avails himself of it, and it expires on the day he rejoins, the day of return being reckoned as a day of duty.\n\nXXII. An officer of the floating establishment returning from privilege leave will, if possible, rejoin the ship to which he belongs, but if this is impracticable, and he has not received instructions (which he should apply for beforehand), he will rejoin at Bombay or Calcutta, reporting himself in person to the Director or Deputy Director. On the departure of an officer on privilege leave or on the return of an officer therefrom, the Commander of the vessel will cause an entry to be made in the ship's log and will forward an extract thereof by the next post to the Director.\n\nXXIII. Temporary leave not exceeding ten days and not in anticipation or in extension of any other kind of leave may be granted by the Director and Deputy Director of the Royal Indian Marine.\n\nXXIV. Temporary leave not exceeding seventy-two hours may be granted by Commanders of vessels and heads of departments to officers under their command.\n\nGeneral Regulations.\n\nXXV. It must be distinctly understood that leave in or out of India or privilege leave cannot be claimed as a right. Both are subject to the exigencies of the public service and will be granted only when an officer's services can be spared. Commanders of vessels and heads of departments will not forward an application for privilege or other leave unless they are able to satisfy the Director of the Royal Indian Marine that the officer's services can be spared without any inconvenience to the public service.\n\nXXVI. An officer who has not completed his term of probation for the Marine service cannot be granted leave with retention of his probationary appointment in excess of three months.\n\nXXVII. The name of an officer, granted leave out of India (other than privilege leave), will be removed from the ship on which borne, and he will draw his pay during such leave\u2014\n\n(a) if proceeded to Europe, through the India Office,\n(b) if proceeded to any colony named in the list in appendix No. 17 of the Civil Service Regulations, in such colony.\n\nHe can, however, draw his leave pay in India if he prefers it.\n\nXXVIII. The name of an officer, granted leave in India (other than privilege leave), will be removed from the ship on which borne, and he will draw his pay during such time from any treasury in India in communication with the Examiner of Marine Accounts.\n\nXXIX. The name of an officer, granted privilege leave (ordinary or accumulated), will continue on the books of his ship, and he will draw his pay either from the ship or from any treasury in India or through a bank or agent, as may be arranged through the Examiner of Marine Accounts.\n\nXXX. During the absence of an officer on leave (privilege or otherwise), he must keep the Director of the Royal Indian Marine acquainted with his actual address and be prepared to return immediately to India should his services be required. When on privilege leave, such recall order will be issued by the Director; when on leave in Europe (other than privilege), by the Secretary of State. Officers spending their leave (other than privilege) in Europe must keep the Secretary of State informed of their address.\n\nXXXI. The Secretary of State in Council reserves to himself the right of making any change in the foregoing rules which circumstances may require.\nESTABLISHMENT OF OFFICERS OF THE INDIAN MARINE AND RATES OF PAY AND ALLOWANCES.\n\nMARINE CIRCULARS OF THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA, Nos. 26 OF 1883 and 4 OF 1886.\n\n| Officers | Rs. |\n|----------|-----|\n| 25 Commanders | 7 1st Grade on 500 per mensem. |\n|              | 9 2nd \" on 400 \" |\n|              | 9 3rd \" on 350 \" |\n|              | Over 6 years' seniority, 250 per mensem. |\n| 32 Lieutenants | 3 \" 200 \" |\n|              | Under 3 \" 150 \" |\n| 19 Sub-Lieutenants | \" 125 \" |\n| 13 Sub-Lieutenants | \" 100 \" |\n\nTotal 89 officers.\n\nCommand Allowances.\n\nFor the command of a sea-going ship in commission (300\u20142,000 tons gross), from Rs. 2 to Rs 10 per diem.

The following is the scale of pensions and compassionate allowances admissible to Officers and Engineers of Her Majesty's Indian Marine and to their families.\n\n2. The service for pension of an officer of the Marine reckons from date of joining his ship or appointment if he is 19 years of age or over; otherwise from date of attaining that age.\n\n3. An officer admitted to the service after 25 years of age will be subject to reduction of pension in the manner and under the rules laid down in the Civil Pension Code.\n\n4. Retirement at the age of 55 years will be compulsory, and all Officers and Engineers of that age now in the service, as well as those who may attain that age within one year, will be required to retire at the expiration of one year from the date of this order.* Should an officer holding the appointment of Director or Deputy Director of the Indian Marine attain that age during his incumbency, he may, with the approval of the Government of India, complete five years in the appointment.\n\n[This rule will not be applicable to those officers who have already received a special extension of tenure.]\n\n5. The following is the scale of pensions:\n\n| Designation | After 3 years' service | After 6 years' service | After 10 years' service | After 15 years' service | After 25 years' service | After 30 years' service |\n|-------------|------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Commanders, 1st grade | Rs.

(Marine Circular No. 8 of 1885.)\n\n\u2020 The pension in no case to exceed one-third of the emoluments drawn by the officer when invalided.\nThe periods of service mentioned in the foregoing table are inclusive of the periods of furlough allowed to count towards pension.\n\n6. The following extra pension will be granted to an officer of the Indian Marine retiring after five years service as Deputy Director or Director:\n\n| Service Duration | Pension Amount |\n|------------------|---------------|\n| For five years' continuous service as Director | Rs. 2,000 |\n| For five years' continuous service as Deputy Director | Rs. 1,000 |\n| For five years' continuous service, partly as Deputy Director and partly as Director, of which not less than two years shall have been as Director | Rs. 1,500 |\n\n7. Service in the survey, on port or dockyard appointments, gives no claim to any higher pension than that fixed for an officer's rank in the Marine. Officers not on the Marine list now serving in such appointments will remain under their present rules.\n\n8. The pension of warrant officers, gunners, and clerks will be calculated under the rules for the Uncovenanted Service, as laid down in the Civil Pension Code, Rs. 60 per mensem (compensation in lieu of board and lodging) being added to their pay for the calculation of pension.\n\n9. Pensions will be payable in rupees in India. If paid in England, they will be converted at the rate of exchange fixed yearly for the adjustment of financial transactions between the Imperial and Indian Governments subject to a minimum rate of 1s. 9d. the rupee.\n\n10. An officer may be allowed to commute a portion, not exceeding one-third of his pension, the commuted value being payable in India under the rules in clause 23, India Army Circulars of 1884.\n\n11. Compassionate allowances on the following scale will be granted to the families of officers who may be drowned or meet with a violent death in the execution of duty:\n\n| Officer Rank | Widow | Child |\n|--------------|-------|-------|\n| Commander    | \u00a3100 a year, or Rs. 100 a month. | \u00a320 a year, or Rs. 20 a month. |\n| Port Officer  |       |       |\n| Chief Engineer|       |       |\n| First Grade Officer | \u00a375 a year, or Rs. 75 a month. | \u00a315 a year, or Rs. 15 a month. |\n| Engineer      |       |       |\n| Second Grade Officer | \u00a350 a year, or Rs. 50 a month. | \u00a310 a year, or Rs. 10 a month. |\n| Third Grade Officer |       |       |\n| Assistant Engineer |       |       |\n\nThe cases of the families of the Director or Deputy Director will be specially considered.\n\n12. The regulations and conditions under which all such compassionate allowances are to be awarded will be analogous to those prescribed for the military service.\n\nOfficers are required to signify their intention to accept the above pension rules by the 31st December, 1885, otherwise it will be understood that they have decided to remain under the rules now applicable to them.\n\nTEMPORARY RETIREMENT\u2014INDIAN MARINE.\n\n(Marine Circular, No. 15 of 1887.)\n\n1. Officers of the Indian Marine, who after exhausting the furlough admissible to them under the Rules printed on p. xcv, are unfit for service, but not irremediably broken in health, may be temporarily transferred to the Retired List.\n\n2. An officer granted temporary retirement will be permitted to remain in that position until his total continuous absence from duty, on furlough and temporary retirement together, amounts to four years. If then still unfit to return to duty, he must be placed on the Permanent Retired List, receiving the pension, if any, or gratuity for which he had qualified at the time of being granted temporary retirement.\n\n3. Time spent on temporary retirement will not count as service for pension, nor will an officer be eligible for promotion while he is in that position. An officer replaced on the effective list from temporary retirement will be restored to the grade and numerical position in that grade, which he occupied before his retirement.\n\n4. Officers will be required to appear before a Medical Board at the expiration of one year on temporary retirement, and again, if retained in that position, before the end of the second year; on doing so they will be allowed their bona fide travelling expenses, and lodging allowance at from 3s. to 5s. per diem, according to rank. In case of appearing before a Board at other times than those specified, at their own request, they must do so at their own expense.\n\n5. Temporary retirement will be subject to the condition that the disease which necessitates it must have been contracted in and by the service: and it will also be subject to Rule 3 of the Pension Regulations of the Indian Marine (p. xcv).\n\nINDIAN MILITARY SERVICE FAMILY PENSION REGULATIONS.\n\n(Instituted 1st Jan. 1873.)\n\nREGULATIONS FOR THE PROVISION OF PENSIONS FOR THE WIDOWS AND ORPHANS OF MILITARY, MEDICAL AND ECCLESIASTICAL OFFICERS IN THE SERVICE OF THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA.\n\n1. Pensions will be provided under these regulations for the widows and orphans of the following officers on the Indian establishment, not being entitled to the benefits of any of the late Military and Medical Funds:\n\n- Officers of the Staff Corps.\n- Officers of the Indian Medical Department.\n- Continuous service officers* of Royal Artillery and Engineers.\n- Chaplains (including Probationary Chaplains).\n\n2. Every officer who enters the service on and after the 1st January 1873, must, as a condition of his appointment, provide pensions for his family under these regulations.\n\n3. For the purposes of these regulations officers are classed as follows:\n\n- Class I.\u2014Lieutenant-Colonels in receipt of Colonel's allowances, and Surgeons-Major-General.\n- Class II.\u2014Lieutenant-Colonels, Archdeacons, Surgeon-Colonels, Brigade-Surgeon-Lieut.-Colonels and Surgeon-Lieut.-Colonels.\n- Class III.\u2014Majors, Senior Chaplains, and Surgeons-Major.\n- Class IV.\u2014Captains, Junior Chaplains, and Surgeon-Captains who have served the Government of India for more than six years.\nClass V.\u2014Lieutenants and Medical Officers who have served the Government of India for less than six years.\n\n6. The pensions provided under these regulations are payable monthly in India, and quarterly in arrear in England, and to date of death.\n\n7. The amounts of the pensions provided are as follows, in addition to any pensions or compassionate allowances granted under Royal Warrant.\n\n(N.B.\u2014The one now in force is dated 22nd February 1890.)\n\n**Table I.\u2014Pension to a Widow during Widowhood, according to the Class of her Husband at the time of his death.**\n\n| CLASS OF HUSBAND AT DEATH | I. | II. | III. | IV. | V. |\n|---------------------------|----|-----|------|-----|----|\n| Amount of pension to widow per ann.: | \u00a3   | \u00a3   | \u00a3    | \u00a3   | \u00a3  |\n| In Europe                 | 160 | 130 | 100  | 70  | 40 |\n\n* For these officers subscription is optional.\n\n**Table II.\u2014Pensions to the Orphan Children of all Classes alike.**\n\n| From birth till age of 6 years. | From age of 6 till age of 12 years. | From age of 12 till age of 21 years. | To females only from age of 21 years for life, or till marriage. |\n|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Amount of pension to each orphan: | \u00a3   | \u00a3   | \u00a3    | \u00a3  |\n| In Europe                       | 10  | 20  | 30   | 45 |\n\n8. The pension of a minor orphan will be paid to his or her mother, or other duly appointed or recognized guardian.\n\nNote.\u2014Annuitants in India may either receive their pensions in Indian currency at the official rate of exchange or in England in sterling; but having once exercised the option any subsequent change can only be permitted at the commencement of the official year.\n\n**Contributions.**\n\n9. The contributions for pensions under these regulations, and the pensions of widows, will be regulated by the class of the contributing officer. An officer cannot secure a higher pension for his widow by contributing as if he belonged to a higher class.*\n\n10. Contributions will be deducted by paymasters or other disbursing officers from the pay abstracts of officers contributing.\n\n10a. The circumstance that an Officer is not in receipt of pay does not relieve him from the necessity of paying his contributions.\n\n11. Donations may be paid in one sum, or in 12 equal monthly instalments. If a donation be paid in instalments, interest on the unpaid portion will be levied at the rate of 4\u00bd per cent. per annum. The balance of any contribution due at an officer's death will be recovered rateably, without interest, from the pensions of his widow and orphans, in 12 monthly instalments in India, or four quarterly instalments in England.\n\n11a. Contributions which become due from subscribers when in Europe must be paid in England in sterling. If a subscriber, previous to quitting India, has commenced the payment of any donation by instalments, he may either complete the payment of the donation in India before leaving, or pay the remaining instalments in England at English rates; but an Officer on half-pay who continues to subscribe at Indian rates has the option of paying in India.\n\n12.

Cl. 9.)\n\nTable VII.\u2014Additional Monthly Contribution, payable by all Classes alike, for each Child living on the First Day of the Month.\n\n| Fixed Sterling rates | Reduced temporarily 16\u00bd per cent. |\n|----------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| \u00a3 s. d.              | \u00a3 s. d.                           |\n| For a son, until age of 21 | 0 1 11                            | 0 1 7                                   |\n| For a daughter, until marriage | 0 4 10                            | 0 4 0                                   |\n\nArrears.\n\n13. Interest at the rate of 4\u00bd per cent. per annum will be charged on arrears. Donations will become due from the date on which the liability is incurred, viz., on marriage, on promotion, or on the birth of a child, but interest will not be charged on sums paid within one month from the date on which they become due.\n\nReports of Marriages, Births, and Deaths.\n\n14. An officer who is married at the date of his admission into the service must report the fact of his marriage at the time, and the names and dates of birth of his children, if any have been born to him. An officer in the service must report his marriage, or the birth of a child born in wedlock, or the death of a wife or child, within one month of the occurrence, to the Comptroller of Military Accounts in the Presidency, or the Director of Funds, India Office, when an officer is in Europe. Forms for this purpose are given in the Appendix.\n\n15. The birth of every child born alive must be reported; but if a child die before it is thirty days old, no payment in respect of it will be required.\n\n15a. If the report of a marriage, or of the birth of a child, be not made within one month of the occurrence, the donation payable in each case will be increased 2\u00bd per cent., and interest thereon charged from the date of marriage or birth of the child. After six months' delay, donations will be increased 5 per cent., and interest charged in the usual manner. (G.O.G.G. No. 381 of 1877.)\n\n15b. In the event of the report of a marriage or the birth of a child not being made by a subscriber during\nhis lifetime, in accordance with the rules, the widow or child will not be entitled to any benefits. (Army Circulars, India, 1880, Clause II.)\n\nPosthumous Child.\n\n16. A pension will be granted to a posthumous child on payment of the donation prescribed in Table V., which may be recovered by 12 monthly instalments in India, or four quarterly instalments in England. The report of the birth of a posthumous child must be made in Form D., the last sentence being omitted.\n\nCommutation of Contributions.\n\n17. Officers may at the date of retirement, or at any subsequent period, commute their monthly contribution by a single payment representing the value thereof during the joint lives of husband and wife, and father and child.\n\nIn the event of the wife dying after the date of commutation, contribution at the unmarried rate must be resumed, or, as an alternative, it may be commuted.\n\nA subscriber who has commuted will on re-marrying become liable for marriage donation and the difference between the married and unmarried rates of contribution, or the commuted value on the joint lives.\n\n18. Widowers and bachelors may in like manner commute their monthly contribution for life. On each subsequent marriage they will become liable for the donation and difference of contribution laid down in the previous articles.\n\nDonation and contribution or its commuted value must be paid for all children born to a subscriber after his retirement from the service.\n\nDuration of Pensions.\n\n19. If a widow remarry, her pension will cease during coverture, but if she again become a widow she will be entitled to revert to her pension as widow of her first husband, or, if her last husband have been a contributor, to receive a pension at her option as the widow of her last husband. A widow can only receive one pension.\n\n20. The pension of a male orphan is payable until he attains the age of 21 years.\n\n20a. Subscribers can make special provision for pension to sons who may become permanently incapacitated from earning a livelihood.\n\nThe pensions so provided for will commence at the age of 21, if the son be then fatherless, or, after that age, on his becoming fatherless, and as regards the amounts of such pensions, and the subscriptions to be paid to secure them, each case will be considered and determined on its merits.\n\n21. The mother or guardian of a male orphan who has completed the age of 16 may, at any time thereafter (on application in Forms F. to H. annexed to these regulations), have the residue of his pension commuted into a single payment, for the due application of which the mother or guardian will be held responsible. The following table gives the commuted values of such pensions:\n\n| Years | 16 | 17 | 18 | 19 | 20 |\n|-------|----|----|----|----|----|\n| Months | \u00a3  | \u00a3  | \u00a3  | \u00a3  | \u00a3  |\n| 0     | 129| 106| 81 | 56 | 28 |\n| 3     | 123| 100| 75 | 49 | 21 |\n| 6     | 117| 94 | 68 | 42 | 14 |\n| 9     | 111| 87 | 62 | 35 | 7  |\n\n22. The pension of a female orphan continues until her marriage, and then ceases absolutely. It does not revive on widowhood.\n\nGood Conduct.\n\n23. The pensions provided under these regulations shall, in all cases, be held during good behaviour only, and will be withheld if any pensioner is found to be leading an immoral life, or on proof of any gross misconduct. The order of the Secretary of State for India in Council in any such case shall be final and conclusive.\n\nAlienation of Pension.\n\n24. A pension paid under these regulations may not be transferred or assigned, or in any way alienated, from the pensioner to whom or for whose benefit it is payable.\n\nPassage Money.\n\n25. An officer may, by a special contribution, provide passage money from India for his widow and orphans. The amount so secured will belong to the officer's estate, but will be primarily applicable to the provision of passage money and outfit for his widow and children. The amount secured must not exceed 1,500 rupees, and a health certificate must in every case be furnished by the subscriber. The value will be determined by the Tables in Major-General Hannington's report.\n\n25a. The special contribution can be paid by monthly instalments not exceeding 24, the instalments in arrear bearing interest at 4\u00bd per cent. per annum, and in the event of a subscriber dying before completion of the payment, the balance due at his death will be deducted from the sum insured.\n\n25b. Native commissioned medical officers are required to pay, as in the case of their ordinary contributions, 5 per cent. over and above the ordinary rates of special contribution (Army Circulars India, 1881, Clause 33).\n\n25c. In the event of a subscriber's family not having occasion to make use of the passage money for which special contribution has been made, it will be paid to his estate on his death, irrespective of whether this occurs before or after his retirement, or whether he continued to subscribe to the pension branch up to the date of his death.\n\nIf an officer on retirement desires to sever his connection with the Insurance Branch, he will be allowed the option of receiving the value of the sum assured at the date of withdrawal.\n\nIf, however, the option is declined at the date of withdrawal from the pension branch, the sum originally assured will be paid in accordance with the rules at the decease of the subscriber. (A.C.I. 1886, Cl. 85.)\n\nTransfer to Her Majesty's Line Regiments, and Officers who resign.\n\n26. Officers who may be transferred from the Indian Staff Corps to Her Majesty's Line regiments, and officers who resign the Service, will be entitled to receive back such portion of their contributions as may be in excess of the risk borne during their membership, but they cannot continue subscribers.\n\nHalf-Pay.\n\n27. A Married officer on half-pay must continue to subscribe at Indian rates (which can be paid in India) for full benefits, or at lower rates for reduced benefits. In the event of his return to full pay, he will revert to full rates and benefits. Unmarried officers must continue to subscribe at the Europe rate of subscription.\nRetired Officers.\n\n28. Married officers who retire from the service on a pension may continue to subscribe at the Europe rate of subscription, or they may withdraw, receiving back such portion of their contributions as is in excess of the risk borne during the term of their membership; but the usual subscription will be deducted from the pension of all such officers until they shall have intimated in writing their intention of withdrawing. Unmarried officers may continue their subscription on the same terms as married officers, but will not be entitled on retirement to any refund in the event of their withdrawal.\n\nDismissed Officers.\n\n29. An officer who is dismissed the service by sentence of a court martial, or by other competent authority, will cease, ipso facto, to be a contributor under these regulations, and will have no claim to any refund. His family will not be entitled to any pensions under these regulations.\n\nCertificates.\n\n30. Declarations as to continued widowhood and the survival of children must be furnished to the Accountant-General, India Office, by whom pensions in Europe are paid under the authority of the Director of Funds.\n\nNote A.\u2014The contributions and donations to be paid by Native Members of the Covenanted Medical Service are fixed for the present at an increase of 5 per cent. on the rates paid by Europeans.\n\nAPPENDIX.\n\nNote.\u2014In England all reports and applications for pensions must be made to the Director of Funds, India Office, London, S.W.\n\nFor the present, the rate of interest is fixed at 4\u00bd per cent. per annum, and the rate of exchange with England at 1s. 8d. the rupee.\n\nForm (B.) of a Letter from an Officer reporting his having joined the service of the Government of India married.
