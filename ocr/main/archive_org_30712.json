It was revised and largely re-written by Mr. (now Sir) James Wilson in 1897. The present edition is for the most part derived from Mr. Wilson, who, in turn, derived the historical sections from Captain Davies. The contents have however been re-arranged so as to conform to the model prescribed in Financial Commissioner's Standing Order No. 43, and statistics have been brought as nearly up to date as possible. As Mr. Wilson's Gazetteer gave a remarkably complete and interesting account of the district as it existed before the days of the perennial canal, and is now out of print, I have studied to reproduce in a slightly condensed form the whole of that account indicating by contrast the amount of progress made in the past twenty years. I fear that the new matter falls far short of the old in completeness and lucidity; for this I can only plead in extenuation the fact that I have had no official connection with that part of the district in which all the most interesting developments have come to pass, and have for that part had to rely entirely upon the courtesy of officers of various departments for my information. The result illustrates once more the rule that it is not good to put new cloth on to an old garment. I can only hope that my patch-work will serve its purpose till such time as the district comes under settlement as a whole, or is officially recognized as containing two districts in itself.\n\nM. S.

It is bounded on the north by the Talagang Tahsil of the Attock District and by the river Jhelum which separates it from the Pind Dadan Khan Tahsil; on the east by Gujrat District and by the river Chenab which separates it from Gujranwala; on the south by the Jhang District; and on the west by the district of Mi\u00e1nw\u00e1li. Its average length from east to west is about 96 miles, and its breadth from north to south averages about 50 miles, but varies from 27 miles near the middle to 72 miles near the west boundary. According to the measurements of the professional survey the area of the district, including the rivers, is 4,791 square miles, while according to the patw\u00e1ris' measurements the area including the rivers is 4,801 square miles. It is divided into two nearly equal portions by the river Jhelum, the western half constituting the Khush\u00e1b Tahsil, while the cis-Jhelum portion is sub-divided into three tahsils also nearly equal in area, the Bhera Tahsil to the east, the Shahpur Tahsil in the middle, and the Sargodha Tahsil to the south.\n\nThe district contains only two towns of more than 10,000 souls, viz., Bhera and Khush\u00e1b with a population of 15,202 and 10,159, respectively. The administrative head-quarters are situated at Sargodha near the centre of the Canal Colony. Shahpur stands seventh in order of area, and eighteenth in order of population among the 28 districts of the Province. It comprises 4.95 per cent. of the total area, 3.5 per cent. of the total population, and 2.5 per cent. of the urban population of the British territory. The latitude, longitude, and height in feet above the sea, of the principal places in the district, are shown in the margin.\n\n| Town     | North Latitude | East Longitude | Feet above Sea-level |\n|----------|----------------|----------------|----------------------|\n| Bhera    | $32^\\circ 28'$ | $72^\\circ 57'$ | 645                  |\n| Shahpur  | $32^\\circ 16'$ | $72^\\circ 31'$ | 600                  |\n| Khush\u00e1b  | $32^\\circ 18'$ | $72^\\circ 24'$ | 600                  |\n| Sargodha | $32^\\circ 5'$  | $72^\\circ 40'$ | 610                  |\n| Sakesar  | $32^\\circ 33'$ | $71^\\circ 59'$ | 4,992                |\nWith the exception of that portion of the Salt Range, which is included in the north of the Khush\u00e1b Tahs\u00edl, the whole of the district forms part of the western basin of the great Indo-Gangetic Plain, and lies almost entirely between 550 and 700 feet above sea-level, with a gradual slope towards the south-west of about 1\u00bd feet in the mile, imperceptible to the eye. The Chenab and Jhelum rivers, crossing this plain on their way to the Indus and the sea, have worn for themselves wide valleys, some 15 or 20 feet below the general level, leaving between them a comparatively high-lying upland tract called the B\u00e1r, while beyond the Jhelum and between it and the Indus River is another wide expanse of upland, locally known as the Thal.\n\nThe Chenab river, locally known as the Chanh\u00e1n, which forms the south-eastern boundary of the district for a distance of 15 miles, must, at some comparatively recent period, have flowed considerably to the west of its present bed. At a distance from it to the west, varying from 10 to 15 miles, a well-defined bank, known locally as the Nakka, separates its valley from the B\u00e1r uplands, and the tract below this bank is intersected in many places by sandy channels, small and large, which have evidently been occupied by the river at various periods, and are generally known as Budh or Budhi, i.e., \"old\" branches of the river. The most marked of them, a hollow about ten feet below the level of the adjoining country, and in some places a hundred yards across, meanders along just below the high bank itself, and carries some local drainage in heavy rains, but is very seldom filled by spills from the river. Another, called the Jandra, which leaves the river below Midh, sometimes floods a small area on its bank and the Halk\u00edw\u00e1h, which leaves the main channel just above the boundary of this district, is too deep to flood any land until after it enters the Chiniot Tahs\u00edl. The annual inundations affect only a narrow fringe along the river, varying in width from two to six miles, and averaging little more than three; but owing to the sandy nature of the soil the moisture percolates a considerable distance and benefits land in the neighbourhood of depressions which is not actually covered by the floods. The soil of the Chenab Valley is generally light and sandy and inferior in productive power to the richer loam of the B\u00e1r uplands and the Jhelum Valley. Moreover the percolation of canal water from the irrigated uplands has resulted in a serious amount of water-logging and efflorescence of alkali; the soil is therefore tending to degeneration. In the villages near the Nakka Bank, it is better than in those nearer the river, having a larger depth of loam above the river sand which underlies the whole tract. The deposits left by the annual floods\nof the Chenab are usually very sandy and much inferior to the rich silt brought down by the Jhelum and some of the other Punjab rivers. New alluvion has to be left uncultivated for some years before it consolidates sufficiently to be worth cultivating, and old land is apt to deteriorate. The minimum recorded discharge of the Chenab river at Chiniot is 335 cubic feet per second, and the maximum about 700,000 cubic feet per second during the great flood of 20th and 21st July 1893, but in ordinary years the discharge varies between 500 and 30,000 cubic feet per second. The river is at its lowest from November to February. It begins to rise in March and attains its maximum level in July and August after which it gradually falls. The mean gauge level at Chiniot is 584\u00b74 in summer and 584\u00b77 in winter. During the last 17 years its height has varied between 12\u00b77 feet above the mean and 8\u00b771 feet below it. Very little advantage was formerly taken of the annual floods in the way of making canals in this tract, which had never more than three small inundation canals irrigating in the best of years about 1,000 acres. Since the opening of the Lower Chenab Canal, with its weir at Kh\u00e1nki, practically the whole river discharge is diverted, in winter, and about 20 per cent. of ordinary flood discharge in summer. The opening of the Upper Chenab Canal is not expected to affect much alteration in these figures, as the surplus supply of the Upper Jhelum Canal will make good the extra loss.\n\nDuring the last 20 years the river, which had formerly been trending towards the west, has swung back to its former position, and now follows closely the boundary between Bhera Tahsil and Gujr\u00e1nw\u00e1la. In the Chenab Valley the underground water-level is everywhere near enough to the surface to admit of irrigation from wells, and the well water is good and sweet. Near the river just outside the belt of cultivation which depends directly on the river floods, there is a belt of cultivated land thickly studded with wells, each of which is surrounded by a clump of fair-sized trees. The water-level here is from 13 to 20 feet below the surface. This area, which now depends primarily on the river for its prosperity, has been much restricted by the construction of the Kh\u00e1dir Feeder and Escape of the Lower Jhelum Canal, and a protective embankment at a distance from the river which varies from 2 to 8 miles. In the portion of the old Chenab Circle which is commanded by the Kh\u00e1dir Feeder, i.e., in the tract about 5 to 10 miles from the river, the sub-soil water is between 13 and 19 feet below the natural surface. There are 15 villages in this belt, and 8 of these have\nwells at work, irrigating 380 acres only, or less than 2 per cent. of the total area irrigated. Above the Nakka Bank the depth to water is between 21 and 17 feet, gradually decreasing as one approaches the Southern Branch of the Canal to 13 feet: in this tract 15 villages out of 24 have wells at work, with an area of 885 acres, or less than 5 per cent. of the total area irrigated. Thus it will be seen that, except for the narrow strip between the river and the flood embankment, the Chenab Circle has lost its old characteristics, and been caught up in the great canal system which has spread all over the once-open uplands known as the B\u00e1r.\n\nIn 1897, Mr. Wilson described the area dividing the valleys of the Jhelum and Chenab in these words:\n\n\"On ascending the Nakka Bank we find ourselves on the B\u00e1r Uplands, which stretch across about 20 miles to the similar bank which again dips down into the Jhelum Valley. A marked change is noticed in the character of the soil and vegetation. Instead of the sandy soil of the riverside we get a good strong loam, capable of growing excellent crops with sufficient moisture; but the water level is now at from 50 to 80 feet below the surface and the water is generally brackish and wells are few and far-between. A considerable area is cultivated with the aid of the drainage from the neighbouring higher ground, but by far the greater part of the B\u00e1r is still uncultivated, covered with a thick growth of shrubs which seldom attain a size worthy of the name of trees, and producing in good seasons an excellent crop of grass, which forms the sustenance of the large herds of cattle kept by the inhabitants of the sparsely scattered villages. Towards the south-west in the Shahpur Tahsil, the soil gets in some places more sandy, in others more saline, and both trees and grass become comparatively sparse and stunted. The B\u00e1r Uplands, like the river valleys, while maintaining the same general slope towards the south-west, are here and there crossed by old river channels, winding and twisting across the country, and it is evident that at some period in the distant past the rivers must have wandered over this tract at a considerably higher level than their present channels. In the east of the Shahpur Tahsil the plain is broken by the outcrop of detached hills, a continuation of the Kir\u00e1na Range in the Jhang District, the highest peak of which, standing about 1,000 feet above the plain, and crowned by a famous monastery, is a conspicuous object from any point within a distance of 30 miles. These hills, though only 40 miles from the Salt Range, are composed of quartzites and schists, quite unlike any rock found in that range, but of the same character as those forming the mass of the distant Ar\u00e1valli hills; so that they appear to be an advanced outpost of the great Peninsular rock system, much older than the Salt Range and even than the mighty Himalaya within sight of which they maintain an undaunted front.\"\nIn the south of the district the valley is 15 miles wide, and canals have not yet been constructed to irrigate land at any great distance from the river. The tract, locally known as the Ara, intermediate between the river in proper and the B\u00e1r Uplands, receiving no irrigation directly or indirectly from the river and having a very scanty rainfall, is dependent for its cultivation almost entirely on wells, and as the underground water-level is from 30 to 55 feet below the surface, and the soil is hard and clayey and cannot be continuously cropped there is much less cultivation and very few trees, and in early summer when there are no crops on the ground the tract presents a bare desolate appearance.\n\nSince then the face of the country has been completely changed by the construction of the Lower Jhelum Canal.\n\nIn place of open shrub-land and struggling wells it is now a great expanse of \"squares\" all fertilised by the silty waters of the Jhelum. The fields are all laid out, with almost geometrical accuracy, in squares of 73 yards each way, and tree-planting is proceeding with fair rapidity. In a word the spacious hunting ground of the untamed cattle-thief has become a parcelled land of wheat and oil, of prosperous farmers and expert horse-breeders, of tidy villages and shaded water-ways.\n\nThe canal takes out of the river at Mung Ras\u00fal in Jhelum District, and, entering the Bhera Tahsil on the north-east curves round to the south so as to form the boundary of the Shahpur and Gujr\u00e1t Districts. The Main Line has its escape in the south-east corner of the Bhera Tahsil, and has three main Branches\u2014the Northern and Southern Branches and the Kh\u00e1dir Feeder\u2014all of which flow westward and command the whole of the Do\u00e1b, except for a fringe in either valley. The Northern Branch throws off near Sargodha the Sulki Branch, which escapes into the Jhelum above S\u00e1h\u00edwal, and in turn throws off the Ghazni Distributary to irrigate the Ar\u00e1 tract. The southern end of the district is still the least prosperous, partly because it gets least rain, partly because the soil is either excessively stiff as in the Ar\u00e1, or unduly sandy, as in the \"Sobh\u00e1ga Jungle,\" and partly because supplies of water are naturally least certain towards the tail of the canal.\n\nOn descending the northern edge of the B\u00e1r, a bank some 10 or 15 feet high, known as the Danda, we find ourselves in the valley of the Jhelum, a tract somewhat similar in character to the valley of the Chenab, but much more fertile, better cultivated, better wooded and more thickly inhabited, owing no doubt to the richer quality of the alluvial silt annually brought down by the Jhelum. This river, the Vedasta and Hydaspes of the ancients, is now locally known as the Jehlam or Vehat, the\nlatter name being more common towards the south of the district. It rises in Kashmir and debouches from the hills at the town of Jhelum from which it takes its name. It then flows south-west for a hundred miles as far as the town of Shahpur, where it takes a sharp turn and then flows almost direct south to its junction with the Chenab. In winter the river shrinks into a narrow channel, sometimes not more than 200 yards wide with a normal minimum discharge of about 9,000 cubic feet per second, the lowest recorded discharge between 1890 and 1915 being 3,000 cubic feet per second. The average width in winter may be taken to be 300 yards, the average velocity about two miles an hour and the greatest depth from 5 to 10 feet. Almost every winter at least one sudden high flood (k\u00e1ng) comes down, due to heavy rain in the hills. Occasionally such a flood reaches summer-level, but it lasts only a day or two. During the last 25 years the level of the river has varied between 10 feet above and 8 feet below the mean*. Towards the end of March, when the snows begin to melt on the distant Himalayas, the river gradually rises, till in May and June it attains an average height of about 6 feet above its usual winter level with a breadth of about half a mile, and a normal maximum discharge of about 68,000 cusecs. When heavy rains fall on the lower hills, the river is liable to sudden freshets, sometimes rising as high as 12 or 13 feet above winter level, and giving a discharge of over 575,000 cubic feet per second. On such occasions the stream, over-leaping its banks, inundates the country for miles on either side, and then gradually subsides within its normal bounds. These freshets sometimes have a destructive effect, washing away valuable crops, or submerging land already under crop, but more frequently they are of incalculable benefit, by depositing a fertile silt over many square miles of country and leaving the land sufficiently moist to produce excellent crops with the aid of a scanty rainfall. In September the river generally subsides in good time to allow the land which has been moistened and fertilised by its floods to be sown with wheat for the spring crop, and seldom inundates that land again until the wheat crop has ripened and been secured. It is this adaptation of the river floods, dependent on the fall of snow and rain on far distant mountain\n\n*The leading gauge-readings at Chak-Nizam Railway Bridge are these:\u2014\n\n| Absolute maximum | ... 675-93 |\n|------------------|------------|\n| Mean maximum     | ... 669-4 (June) |\n\n| Absolute minimum | ... 658 |\n|------------------|----------|\n| Mean minimum     | ... 662-6 (December) |\n\nMean annual discharge ... 668-5 (about 29,000 cusecs).\nranges, to the seasons in the plains, and to the needs of the wheat crop, which makes the land along the rivers within reach of their annual inundations such a fertile and valuable possession in this region of scanty rainfall. One peculiarity of the river Jhelum is that it rises earlier than the other Punjab rivers, probably because it is more dependent on the melting of the snows and less on the summer rainfall than they are. This is very fortunate, as the cold weather supply of the river is now apt to be much reduced by the needs of the two Jhelum Canals. Occasionally the entire flow is intercepted by the Lower Jhelum Canal at Ras\u00fal, and only about 3,000 cusecs find its way back to the river by percolation. On these occasions the ferry contractors are apt to suffer considerable loss of custom, and the inundation-canal owners feel nervous for their early waterings.\n\nThe Jhelum valley, which is little more than 2 miles wide where the river enters the district, rapidly widens until at Shahpur it is 12 miles and at S\u00e1h\u00edw\u00e1l 15 miles wide. It is generally well defined by the Danda bank separating it from the B\u00e1r uplands on the one side, and on the other by a similar bank, known as the Dh\u00e1h, above which lie the sandy plains of the Thal. Between these banks the river must have meandered at various times within a comparatively recent period, and the valley is intersected by winding channels in which the river must formerly have flowed, but which are now dry hollows, sometimes 10 or 12 miles distant from the present channel of the river. About Shahpur these old river beds are known as Didh\u00e1r, and further south as R\u00edn. One of the most marked of them cuts up the country immediately south-east of Shahpur; another, often called the R\u00e1n\u00edfw\u00e1h, runs along near the Danda bank forming the eastern boundary of the valley. At present, however, the river Jhelum hugs the western border of its valley pretty closely. In few places is the Dh\u00e1h bank of the Thal more than 2 miles distant from the river, and in some places, as at Jaura and Hamoka, the stream is actually cutting away the high land of the Thal itself. The westward tendency of the river, which must have been going on for some centuries, is still in operation, though for the moment a temporary set-back is occurring opposite Khush\u00e1b. Since the regular settlement, some 55 years ago, more than 5,000 acres in the country to the south of Shahpur, which was then subject to river-floods, is now hardly ever flooded, and a large area of land, especially from Shahpur southwards, which was then on the west side of the main stream,\nis now on the east side. The process results in ultimate gain, for the rich silt deposited by the river is much more fertile than the barren soil it cuts away.\n\nIn consequence of this westward tendency of the river, only narrow strips and patches of its valley are now found on its west bank, while to the east it has left behind it a wide level lowland of fertile soil, with abundance of sweet well water at a depth below the surface varying from 15 to 55 feet according to the distance from the river. Advantage has been taken of this store of moisture to sink numerous wells for purposes of irrigation; and during the 30 years that followed the British occupation several canals were constructed, both by the State and by private persons, to conduct the water of the river in the annual flood-season on to the land of the valley at a distance from the present river-bed, and lower down its course\u2014a process rendered possible by the gradual slope of the country towards the south-west. So good are the soil and water, and so profitable is cultivation, that the Jhelum valley as a whole is much more densely populated than any other part of the district, and although it comprises less than a fifth of the total area, it contains much more than a third of the population of the whole district. Five of the six towns, which have more than 5,000 inhabitants each, are situated in this tract. Near the river the villages are thickly clustered, almost every acre is cultivated, the wells are numerous, and the country well wooded. More especially the tract from Mi\u00e1ni down to Shahpur, which is now fully irrigated by canals and wells, wears an air of great prosperity; and when riding through it on a spring morning one's eye is delighted with an endless expanse of waving green wheat, broken only by the wells and villages, each with its clump of shady trees.\n\nOn leaving the immediate neighbourhood of the river Jhelum and ascending the high bank which bounds its valley to the west, one suddenly plunges into a wilderness of sand, which extends westward for some 30 miles to the boundary of the district, and beyond that about as far again to the edge of the Indus valley. This desert tract, known as the Thal, which occupies almost the whole of the Sind S\u00e1g\u00e1r Do\u00e1b, between the rivers Jhelum and Indus, forms a marked contrast to the level loamy B\u00e1r soil of the uplands on the other side of the Jhelum. Although it appears to have a somewhat similar substratum of hard, level soil, its surface is covered by a succession of sandhills with a general north and south direction, one following the other like the waves of an angry sea. Between the hillocks the harder subsoil\nappears in strips and patches, which are in some places of considerable extent (patti) but the general appearance of the country is that of a sandy rolling prairie, covered in years of good rainfall with grass and stunted bushes, but in seasons of drought, which are of frequent occurrence, little better than a desert. Trees are small in size and of rare occurrence, the underground water is from 40 to 60 feet below the surface, and generally brackish, irrigation from wells is almost unknown, the villages are few and far between, and the scanty population subsists largely on the produce of the flocks and herds which wander from place to place in search of grass.\n\nTen years ago the only cultivation consisted of small patches of cheap millets and pulses, or very inferior water melons. But it has since been discovered that excellent gram crops can be raised in an ordinary winter, and year by year larger areas are devoted to raising them; the change from pasture to agriculture as the principal means of livelihood is going on apace. The resulting development of the land is, of course, overshadowed by the brilliant success of the Lower Jhelum Canal, but is none the less remarkable.\n\nThe sandy hillocks of this once desolate region end somewhat abruptly at a distance of 7 or 8 miles from the steep escarpment of the Salt Range which bounds the horizon to the north. The tract between the desert and the hills is a flat plain of hard soil, much of it impregnated with salts and producing hardly even a bush or a blade of grass. It is known as the Chhachh, and is the favourite haunt of the mirage. Near the base of the hills, however, the character of the soil changes. The mountain torrents, in the course of ages, have brought down immense quantities of detritus from the sandstone and limestone rocks of which the upper surface of the range is chiefly composed, and have covered the nearer portion of the salt and sterile plain with a fertile soil sloping gradually outwards from the base of the precipitous hills and requiring only a sufficiency of moisture to make it very productive. In years of favourable rainfall the torrents rush down from the gorges and spread in deltaic fashion over the moraines they themselves have formed, being brought under control soon after they leave the hills by an elaborate system of embankments erected and maintained by the industrious peasants. The most important of these torrents are the Vahi, which drains a large area in the Salt Range as far west as Bhukhi and Uchhala and debouches on to the plains near the village of Katha; the Surakka which gathers water from\nnear Khura on the one side, and from near Jahlar on the other, and irrigates the fine estates of Jabbi and Dhokri; and the Dhoda which, after receiving the drainage of Sakesar and the hills around Amb, fertilizes the lands of the border village of Kiri Golewali. But of the many gorges through which the drainage of the Salt Range finds its way into the plains only four hold a constant supply of water (j\u00eb). The small stream which flows throughout the year in the bed of the Vahi torrent is utilised for irrigation and other purposes at Sodhi and Katha; another at Kund does little more than afford drinking-water to the village and irrigate the public garden at Nurewala and the streams which trickle down the beds of the Dhoda and Surakka torrents are so salt as to be quite undrinkable. The scarcity of good water is one of the marked characteristics of this part of the district. Much good work might be done in the way of conducting down to the villages water from springs in the hills by a District Officer who could capture the enthusiasm of the villagers sufficiently to prevent them from fighting about the water when it was brought to them. The subsoil everywhere is so thoroughly impregnated with saline matter that all attempts to obtain drinkable water by means of wells have failed; and the inhabitants are dependent for their water supply on the springs which here and there trickle from the rocks, sometimes far up in the hills, or on ponds excavated so as to catch some of the drainage water in times of rain. When these ponds dry up, as they generally do in summer, the people and cattle are often put to great straits and have to rely on shallow borings, from which they scoop the almost palatable surface-water, or else to go long distances to obtain a supply of water sufficient for their daily wants. Still the land immediately along the foot of the range (Mohar) is so fertile when irrigated by the hill-torrents that a large population inhabits the tract and derives a living from agriculture. While the main village is usually situated at the foot of the range, there are generally a large number of detached hamlets (bh\u00e1n or dhok) out in the plains or up in the hills, in which the people live while their crops are ripening in the fields near by. Their prosperity, dependent as it is entirely upon a very uncertain rainfall, is more than usually precarious.\n\nThe Salt Range forms the southern boundary of the rugged plateau extending from Sub-Himalayas southwards over the greater part of the Rawalpindi and Jhelum Districts. After running from near Jhelum in a south-west direction parallel to the course of the river, and at a distance from it nowhere greater than 12 miles, it suddenly, at a point nearly opposite the town of\nKhush\u00e1b, turns to the north-west. It then soon culminates in the peak of Sakesar, from which it immediately dwindles into a low narrow ridge, and at the same time turns still more to the north till it crosses the Indus near K\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1gh. The most southernly corner of the range, formed by these changes of direction, lies in the Khush\u00e1b Tahsil of the Shahpur District, to which has been allotted a length of 47 miles of the highest portion of the chain. Here its southern edge rises precipitously from the level plain of the Sind S\u00e1g\u00e1r Thal (which lies about 700 feet above sea level) to a general height of some 2,500 feet, with several peaks reaching to over 3,000 feet, the Sakesar hill itself, the highest point in the whole range, being 4,992 feet above the level of the sea. On the north side, however, it slopes much more gradually towards the Talagang plateau, which lies some 1,800 feet above sea level. When it enters this district from Jhelum, the range consists of two parallel ridges running east and west at a distance of 8 miles apart. These soon bend towards each other and are connected by a confused mass of smaller ridges about Sodhi; then they open out to a distance of some 16 miles across, and again suddenly narrowing meet in the Sakesar hill. These external ridges thus include within them several high-lying valleys with a general height above sea-level of from 2,000 to 2,500 feet, divided from each other by numerous ridges, generally long and narrow, and almost all running east and west parallel to the general direction of the range. Of these valleys much the most important is the S\u00fan, a land-locked plain immediately to the east of Sakesar with a length of 14 miles and a maximum breadth of 4 miles. The surplus drainage from the hills surrounding this valley, finding no outlet, collects in the Uchh\u00e1li lake (Kah\u00e1r), sometimes called the samundar. The area of this lake, which is at present (1915) 2,133 acres, varies with the seasons. At regular settlement, about 1863, it covered 1,425 acres; in 1890 after a dry season its area was 1,128 acres, and in 1892, after the heaviest rainfall within living memory, it extended over 2,550 acres, and submerged a large area of cultivated land round its margin. Its water is salt, and in drying up exhales a strong briny odour; but the water of wells dug within a short distance of its margin is sweet and drinkable. A rough estimate was lately made of the cost of draining the lake into the Nammal Lake to the north by means of a tunnel through the intervening ridge, but the cost was found to be prohibitive. It would be a great advantage if this lake and that at Khabakki could be drained. Every wet year throws land out of cultivation, and even in a dry year the land from which the lake recedes is so soured by saline deposits that it is of very little use for\nagriculture. It is believed that the wells are fed from sources which would not be affected by the lowering of the lakes' surface. There are within the Salt Range a number of other rock-bound basins, the lowest parts of which are covered with water after rain; but the only two containing perennial lakes are one at Khabakki, the area of which under water was 260 acres in 1863, 146 acres in 1890, 676 acres in 1892, and 595 in 1915; and the other at Jahlar, the corresponding figures for which are 44, 46, 84, and 69 acres. The other hollows apt to be flooded are Khutakka (404 acres), Pail (31), Bhadrar (145), Mardwal (118), Ugali (100) and Shakarkot (49), but they generally dry up in sufficient time to allow wheat to be sown. The figures given are the areas submerged after heavy rains of 1892, and should similar floods recur it will probably be found necessary to remit the revenue of the submerged lands as was done on that occasion. The rainfall of the northern ridge drains northwards on to the Talagang plateau, while that of the southern ridge finds its way through numerous picturesque and precipitous gorges southwards on to the Sind Sagar plain.\n\nThe soil of the valleys formed by the gradual disintegration of the limestone and sandstone rocks of the hills above is exceedingly fertile and its powers are being constantly renewed by fresh deposits brought down by the torrents. It does not vary much in general character throughout the tract, except that in Jaba and other villages to the north-east, which are bounded on the north by a range of sandstone instead of the usual limestone, the soil is more sandy and less fertile than in the villages to the west. Its productive powers, however, differ greatly from village to village and even in the same village, according as the situation of the field places it more or less in the way of intercepting the water and the fertilizing deposits brought down by the torrents. Hence the very elaborate system of embankments maintained by the industrious peasants, the result of which is that the slopes of the valleys have been gradually worked into a succession of terraces, one below the other, and that in some cases the dams are so strong and so well designed that the natural channel of a large torrent remains perfectly dry, and even after heavy rainfall on its catchment area in the hills, the whole stream is turned on to the ridges on either side and passing gradually down from terrace to terrace irrigates a large area of comparatively high land which would otherwise remain dry and almost unculturable. Several instances of this may be seen on the way from Uchhali to Naushahra. The fertile soil of the valleys thus irrigated supports a large population, and their villages, situated at no\ngreat distance from each other, may be seen nestling at the foot of the hills or clustered on the ridges.\n\nUnfortunately for the beauty of the landscape, the Salt Range peasants think their land too valuable to grow trees, and the valleys are almost bare except for small clumps of trees round the few wells. The southern face of the range presents a forbidding aspect towards the Thal, its ragged and broken cliffs, its distorted strata and huge detached masses of rock telling plainly of the violence of the commotion which attended its birth. This effect is heightened by the absence of vegetation due to the steepness of the hills on this side and the want of sufficient soil and moisture. The gorges, however, which pierce the range in several places, have a certain grandeur and beauty of their own. The most picturesque of these is that at Sodhi where a stream of pure sparkling water dashes over great boulders between precipitous cliffs fashioned by rain and frost into shapes suggestive of a row of Egyptian gods. It is this stream which, rushing through a succession of gorges where it sometimes forms deep pools of clear water fringed by shady trees, passes under the holy shrine of Narsingh Phohar with its cascade and petrifying springs, and debouches on to the plain at Katha. From the top of Sakesar hill on a clear day a pleasing view is to be had in all directions. Looking eastward one sees at one's feet the fertile valley of the S\u00fcn with its lake, and the green line of trees which marks the road meandering like a huge snake away into the distance. Beyond, the smaller lake of Khabakki, and still farther off a reach of the distant Jhelum river, catch the eye. Southwards lies a confused mass of mountains beyond which under a dim haze the desert of the Thal fades away to the horizon. On a very clear day Kir\u00e1na is conspicuous, rising abruptly from the plain. Westwards, the mighty Indus rolls his way to the sea, taking with him the waters of the Kurram river and bordered by the Suleman Range, with Shekh Bud\u00edn and the Takht-i-Sulem\u00e1n. Northwards lies the rugged plateau of Pakkhar and Talagang, beyond which may be seen the Himalaya Range above Murree, and if the sky is clear of clouds, the snow-clad summits of the Sufedkoh.\n\nIn barest outline, the geology of the district shows three distinct systems\u2014the Kir\u00e1na group of hills in the south, the Salt Range on the north, and the alluvion of the Sind S\u00e1g\u00e1r and Jech Do\u00e1bs in between. The Kir\u00e1na system shews an unioinal structure with northerly dip, and consists of dark-coloured and quartz-veined beds of coarse brown ferruginous sandstone, greenish quartzite and silicious clay-slate, and appears to be like the Delhi\nridge, a far-flung outlier of the Aravalli system. In age it is not later than Lower Silurian, and is probably Cambrian or pre-Cambrian. It contains no fossils, but small specimens of Pyrolusite or peroxide of manganese are found in small cracks while numerous white quartz veins contain masses of rich haematitic iron-ore or limonite and a curious carbonate of lime and iron.\n\nThe Salt Range enters this district from Mi\u00e1nw\u00e1li at Sakesar and runs along the entire northern boundary in a curve, which passes somewhat north of east into Jhelum District. The range as a whole owes its existence and its sinuosity to the lateral out-thrust proceeding from the greater mountain chains on either side. There appear to have been various periods of elevation and subsidence, the last elevation taking place subsequently to the upper tertiary period. There are indications of land to the south, as far back as the period of the earliest groups and again at various stages up to tertiary times. The general character of this range also is apparently anticlinal, the northern side of the anticlinal arch only being present. The southern branch of the anticline has been faulted out of sight by an over-thrust dislocation. The northern slopes show fairly regular disturbance, and constant northerly dip, while the southern slopes are strongly broken, dislocated, and precipitous\u2014a fact which may be attributed partly to meteoric denudation facilitated by the perishable nature of the underlying salt and gypseous marl, and partly to true faults, which are generally in directions oblique to that of the range, and frequently coincide with marked physical features such as the Narsingphohar, Surakka, and Amb ravines. The plateaux contained between the northern and southern slopes consist of a series of markedly anticlinal billows enclosing alluvial basins, three of which drain into the salt lakes of Uchhali, Khabekki and Jahlar.\n\nThe principal stratigraphical formations found in this district may be arranged in sequence, from the top, as follows:\n\n1. Post-tertiary conglomerates and superficial deposits.\n2. Tertiary sandstones of the Miocene period, containing mammalian bones, crocodilian remains, and fossil wood.\n3. Nummulitic limestone, of Eocene age; this formation caps the higher hills, and is rich in large gastropods, bivalves, echinoderms and many other similar fossils.\n(6) Soft green-brown and olive sandstones, conglomerates and dark shales, of the Cretaceous period, containing terebratulae and bivalves: this group is confined to the tract east of the Narsinghphohar gorge.\n\n(7) White and red soft sandstones, yellowish and gray limestones and yellow marls of the Jurassic period, containing ammonites, belemnites, etc.: this group is found to the west of the Kathwai stream.\n\n(8) Limestones, sandstones, shales and clays of the Trias, containing ceratites, gasteropods, and bivalves.\n\n(9) The \"Productus Limestone\" of Permian age, containing productus, spirifera, bellerophon, goniatites and many other fossils, including some of the earliest known ammonoids with complex sutures (Cyclolobus and Medlicottia).\n\n(10) Granular, strongly bedded sand-stones surmounted by pale-lavender clay, and underlaid by a remarkable boulder-bed of glacial origin, approximately Upper Carboniferous in age, the equivalent of the Talchir boulder-bed of the Gondwana formation of Peninsular India.\n\n(11) Black and dark gray argillaceous beds of the Cambrian period are only found to the east of the Sangla torrent in Nalli; they have been dated by the discovery of Obolus and siphonotata in the Jhelum District.\n\n(12) Purple sand-stones, which are unfossiliferous and of doubtful age.\n\n(13) Gypseous red salt-marl with masses of rock-salt underlies the whole range, and is probably pre-Cambrian. The marl is entirely unfossiliferous.\n\nThe conformity or rather parallelism of the strata is as a whole decidedly well-marked, but faulting and weathering have in very many places brought formations of very different antiquity into juxtaposition. In addition to the rocks enumerated above, mention must be made of the calcareous tufa which is widely distributed, and is still in process of formation at a spring near Narsinghphohar where twigs and leaves are petrified with astonishing rapidity. It is remarkable that a rock so lightly constructed should, when used for building purposes, withstand the ravages of time as it has done in the ancient masonry of Amb and the numerous tombs that surround the lakes. For a more detailed description of a range of great interest to geologists the reader must refer to Mr. A. B. Wynne's Memoir,\n(Volume XIV of the Memoirs of the Geological Survey of India), which gives a most lucid and informing account of all points of interest.\n\nThe remarkable fossils from these hills have been described by Dr. Waagen in the \"Palaeontologia India.\"\n\nThe alluvion of the Do\u00e1bs consists of an alternation of clays and sands which are only of interest to well-borers.\n\nThe characteristic trees and shrubs of the B\u00e1r uplands are the van, kari, jand and malla, together forming the jungle with which the uncultivated lands are generally covered. The van or jal (salvadora oleoides), with its leaves something like the mistletoe, often forms a dense bush, such as cattle-thieves like to find for the concealment of stolen cattle. Camels, goats and sheep browse on its leaves, and its wood is used for fuel, but burns with an unpleasant smell, and leaves a great deal of ash. The sweet berry-like fruit (pilu) is very generally eaten by the poorer classes, great numbers of whom, especially the women and children, go out daily in June into the jungle and form a sort of picnic party, returning in the evening laden with fruit. In dry seasons the pilu is especially abundant, and if the price of grain is high, numbers of the poor live almost entirely on pilu, camping in the jungle for days so as to be near the supply. From the number of cases that arise in connection with it, pilu gathering seems to be considered a favourite opportunity for flirtation. The kari (capparis aphylla) has hardly any leaves, but when covered in April with its numerous brick-red blossoms gives colour to the landscape. Its wood is used for roofing, and makes a good fuel for burning bricks. Its fruit when unripe (dela) is used to make pickles, and when ripe (pinju or dela) is eaten, especially in times of scarcity. The jand (prosopis spicigera), sometimes a mere bush, but often attaining a height of 10 or 15 feet, gives an excellent fuel used for locomotive engines and other purposes. Its leaves and pods (sanggri) form a good fodder. The leaves of the malla (zizyphus nummularia) are also an excellent fodder, its berries are eaten in times of scarcity and its thorny twigs are much used for making enclosure-hedges, and make a good fuel.\n\nIn the river valleys the most numerous trees are the kikkar and t\u00e1lhi, which are very largely grown especially on cultivated land. The kikkar (acacia arabica), though said not to be indigenous in the Punjab, has taken very kindly to the soil, and springs up wherever there is a little moisture in a marvellous manner, being often self-sown. The young trees are apt to be\nkilled by hard frost, but can stand it after the first year or two. It is a quick growing tree, often reaching 15 feet in five years. Its leaves make an excellent fodder and in times of drought the kikkar trees are ruthlessly lopped to save the cattle. Its pods are greedily eaten by goats and sheep. The timber is used for all sorts of purposes, and especially for agricultural implements, and it makes an excellent fuel. Altogether the tree is the most useful one we have, and many small groves of it are maintained by the better class of landowners.\n\nThe t\u00e1hli (shisham\u2014dalbergia sissoo) has been planted in great numbers along roads and canals and several groves of it have been formed in the canal-irrigated tracts and near the rivers. Many of the wells too have small plantations of t\u00e1hli, the result of an order issued at regular settlement, requiring the owners of every well to plant a few trees about them. Its leaves are good for fodder and its timber is excellent for almost all purposes. The t\u00e1hli stands next in importance to the kikkar among the trees of the district.\n\nThe shirth (siris\u2014albizzia lebbek), with its fragrant flowers and rustling pods, is found chiefly along the roadsides. A small grove of the tall, pale, ghostly albizzia procera adorns the old head-quarters station.\n\nThe uk\u00e1h or kodh (far\u00e1sh\u2014tamarix articulata), with its gnarled trunk and needle-like leaves, is fairly common and does not require so much moisture as most other trees. The ber (zizyphus jujuba) is very common on the roads and in the fields and its fruit is much appreciated. It is often covered by a curious leafless parasite (nidh\u00e1ri) used as a medicine. Groves of stunted chhachhra (dh\u00e1k\u2014butea frondosa), with its large scarlet flowers, are found in the north corner of the Bhera Tahsil.\n\nArboriculture on the Lower Jhelum Canal has largely specialized in the production of kikkar and t\u00e1hli, but in the Civil Station at Sargodha the advantages of variety have not been wholly overlooked.\n\nIn the neighbourhood of wells may be seen the soh\u00e1njna (moringa pterygosperma), with its corky bark, pollard head and bunches of white flowers, the las\u00fara (cordia myxa), with its bright flowers and edible fruit; the mulberry (t\u00fai\u2014morus alba), the fruit of which also is much appreciated. The date-palm (khajji\u2014ph\u00e6nix dactylifera) is common only in a few places on the Jhelum, and especially at Sada Kamboh above Shahpur and at Majhoka and Khai near the Jhang border. Its leaves are\nmade into mats and baskets and its stems are useful for water channels. The fruit is not particularly good, but fetches good prices, especially the produce of a particular group of trees at Khai, called the musallin. An attempt is being made to interest the villagers in the cultivation of improved classes of date-palm. The indigenous stock is rapidly deteriorating. Specimens of the bohr (banyan\u2014ficus bengalensis) and pipal (ficus religiosa) are met with chiefly near towns and often owe their origin to the pious care of Hindus; there are some old trees of both kinds near the ancient town of Takht Haz\u00e1ra on the Chenab.\n\nFruit trees of all the ordinary kinds have been much cultivated both by the District Board and by private persons, and there are good gardens and orchards near all the towns and larger villages. The fruit produced, however, is as a rule of inferior quality.\n\nIn the flooded lands along the rivers lei or pilchi (tamarix gallica or dioica) springs up in considerable thickets and is used for wattling, baskets and roofs. The akk (calotropis procura) is very common in sandy soil, but is of little use. Even the migratory locusts do not touch it, apparently dreading its acrid milky juice; but it has a resident locust of its own and is sometimes eaten by goats. The kh\u00e1r or saji plant (salsola Griffithsii) and its uses are described in Chapter II, Section D. Allied to it are the lana and lami (also salsolas) which are much appreciated as grazing for camels, and are found in barren saltish soils at a distance from the river. The camel-thorn (jaw\u00e1ha\u2014alhagi maurorum) is most noticeable as a thorny weed among the wheat. Near the river the flooded lands are much infested by a thistle-like weed called leha, and another thorny weed called pohli; and well-irrigated lands, especially when the soil is poor or the cultivation bad, suffer much from an onion-like weed, the bhukat, which springs up with the crop and chokes it; the harmal (peganum harmala) is another common weed on cultivated ground. The bhakhra (tribulus alatus) has a woody spiked fruit which is sometimes made into flour by the poor in famine times; the t\u00e1ndla, a tall weed, is eaten by cattle and sometimes as a vegetable by men.\n\nThe few trees to be found in the dry and sandy Thal are chiefly jand, which is found in groves protected by the reputation of some departed saint; stunted kikkar rarely found round ponds, and a grove of ber trees round the town of N\u00farpur, which are specially protected by a clause in the village administration paper. The characteristic bushes of this region are the lana, akk, and harmal which have already been described; and the\nphog (calligonum polygonoides), a good fodder plant, little found except in Rakh Nurpur; b\u016bi (paunderia pilosa), a low whitish plant with flower heads like catkins; khipp (crotalaria burhia), sometimes used for making ropes for temporary use; and the tumma or kartumma (citrullus colocynthus) with its trailing stems and beautiful green and yellow orange-like fruit scattered in profusion over the sand-hills. Their taste is very bitter, but goats eat them and a medicine for horses is made from them to prevent indigestion.\n\nThe Salt Range has a vegetation of its own, very different in character from that of the plains (see Dr. Stewart's Salt Range Flora\u2014Agri-Horticultural Society of India's Journal, Volume I, Part I, new series). The southern aspect, with its steep escarpments, is generally almost devoid of vegetation, but the northern sides of the hills which have a more gradual slope and retain more soil and moisture are covered, though scantily, with trees and bushes. Among the most characteristic trees are the phul\u0101h (acacia modesta) with its delicate leaves and little yellow globes of blossom; the wild olive (kau or kavva\u2014olea cuspidata) with its glossy deep green foliage, often seen growing out of the cleft of a bare rock; a species of oak (vari\u2014quercus incana); the wild fig (khab\u0101r\u012b\u2014ficus carica) with its edible fruit; the lah\u016bra or rah\u016bra (tecoma undulata) with its beautiful large, bright orange-coloured flowers and useful timber; the kul\u0101r (bauhinia variegata) with its large purple or white flowers; the dhamman (grewia vestita); the vatamman (celtis australis) with an edible fruit; the kangar (pistacia integerrima); and in the rocky torrent beds, the oleander (kanh\u012bra\u2014nerium odorum) with its poisonous leaves and rose-coloured flowers. Among the trees which have been introduced lately with success are the mulberry (t\u016bt\u2014morus alba), the dhrek, t\u0101nd or bakain (melia azadarach) with its strong-scented lilac flowers, the poplar (shufaida\u2014populus alba), willow (baint\u2014salix), chil (pinus longifolia) and eucalyptus; and in the gardens at Sodhi and Sakesar, the pomegranate, peach, loquat, apricot, almond, and other fruit trees. The leaves of the phul\u0101h and wild olive form good fodder for cattle in times of drought, and their wood makes excellent timber, that of the phul\u0101h being much used for agricultural implements and that of the wild olive for making combs and walking-sticks. The mulberry and dhrek (Persian lilac) have firmly established themselves in the popular favour; and some recent experiments in silk-worm rearing hold out hopes that the former tree may prove a welcome source of profit to the villagers. A peculiar shrub found chiefly on Sakesar is the\ndwarf palm (*pattha\u2014chamaerops ritchiciana*), from the leaves of which baskets and excellent matting are made. Among the shrubs that clothe the hillside, the most common are the *vahekar* (*adhatoda vasica*), *santha* (*dodonaea viscosa*), the wood of which is much used for roofing purposes, and the evergreen box (*pappar\u2014buxus sempervirens*), the wood of which (*chikri*) is manufactured into combs. Ivy and ferns are also found in moist places; and on the dry rocky slopes a useless plant, called the *av\u00e1ni* (*ballota limbata*), affords an easy opportunity for a joke against the Aw\u00e1ns, who are the dominant tribe in the Salt Range.\n\nOn Sakesar a very common plant is the *maste\u00e1ra* (*scutellaria linearis*), an infusion of which is useful for rheumatism; and the rennet plant (*withania coagulans*) is also to be found. Reeds (*n\u00e1r*) grow in moist places along the torrent beds, and are used for thatching, for pipe-stems and for mouth-pieces for musical instruments.\n\nAmong the most common grasses of the B\u00e1r are the *khabbal* (*cynodon dactylon*), the *d\u00fab* of Hindust\u00e1n, an excellent fodder for cattle and horses; the *chhemb\u00e1r* (*eleusine flagellifera*), much the most common grass of all, eaten readily when green, when dry it is called *bhuttha*; the *saw\u00e1k* (*panicum colonum*) which is also cultivated in the riverain and affords an edible seed; the *murak* which springs up very quickly in hollows after rain, but is of little substance, when ripe it is called *d\u00edla*; the fragrant *kh\u00e1vi*, of a reddish colour, not eaten by cattle except in hard times, commonly used to strew on the floor of mosques, when it blossoms it is called *dor* and when dry *kurak*; the *palw\u00e1h* (*andropogon annulatum*), a tall grass good for cattle but not for horses; the *dh\u00e1man* (*pennisetum cenchroides*), perhaps the best of the milk-producing grasses; the *dabhh* (*poa cynosuroides*), a poor fodder grass, used for making ropes; the *khirmadh\u00e1na*, a tall fodder grass; the *bar\u00faa*, found chiefly in cultivated ground; the *d\u00e1gur* which grows best under the *v\u00e1n* tree; the *surd\u00e1*, a tall red grass; the *garham*, a tall fragrant grass, not good for cattle; the *l\u00fanak*, a tall, graceful and useful grass with a saltish flavour; the *panni* (*andropogon muricatum*), a tall coarse grass, only eaten by cattle when green, the roots of which are the *khas* of which *tattis* are made; from the grass itself sieves and screens are manufactured; the *markan*, a small grass sprouting in the cold weather, which gives its name to a famine year (1890 *Sambat*, 1833 A.D.) because it seeded very plentifully in that year and its seeds were much consumed by the famishing population; and the *chinkhi*, which grows in low tufts, the seed of which is also eaten in famine times.\nIn the river valleys, besides the above grasses, the most important are the sar and k\u0101h. The sar (*Saccharum munja*), a very tall grass, often reaching the height of ten feet or more with large feathery spikes of flowers, grows very readily on irrigated lands near the Jhelum. Indeed it often proves itself a nuisance on the banks of the canals and in grass-preserves, and large sums of money have been spent in the endeavour to get rid of it. In its proper place it is a most valuable grass and sometimes a small patch of it will be found cultivated near a well. The sar grass at Megha is annually sold at sums which during the five years ending 1892 varied from Rs. 400 to Rs. 1,070, and averaged Rs. 725, and considerable sums have at times been paid for the sar grass along the banks of the State Canals. The young shoots are readily eaten by cattle. The reed-like stems (k\u0101na) are used for thatching and for making chairs and stools; the thin end of the stalk (*tili*) makes winnowing baskets and screens (*surki*); and the sheathing petiole, after being burnt at the lower end and beaten with a mallet, yields a fibre (*munj*) which is twisted into ropes, and used for all sorts of purposes by the peasants. The k\u0101h (*Saccharum spontaneum*) grows in the lands most subject to river floods and makes valuable grazing for buffaloes.\n\nIn the Thal the commonest grasses are the chhembar and the fragrant kh\u00e1vi, already described; the excellent dhaman is rare except in Rakh N\u00farpur. Clumps of the sen grass (*Elionurus hirsutus*) are often to be seen; a coarse woody grass of similar appearance (*Prinisetum dichotomum*) is called phittsen; its long fibrous roots are collected by wandering families of Ch\u00fahras, who make from them brushes (*kuchchan*) used by weavers for sizing the warp and by house-wives to clean dishes.\n\nIn the Salt Range most of the grasses found in the B\u00e1r are to be met with; but the characteristic grasses are the babhar, a tall grass common on Sakesar from which are often made the ropes used to carry the pots on a Persian wheel, as such ropes stand the action of water well; the phareo and khar, good fodder grasses; and the sureala, a thorny-seeded grass of little use.\n\nAccording to tradition tigers used to infest the Salt Range, but none have been seen there lately. Leopards and hyenas are, however, occasionally heard of in the hills, and wolves used to be pretty common, especially in the B\u00e1r jungle. During the five years ending 1914 the Government reward was paid for 20 leopards and only 3 wolves. The number of these animals is probably rapidly decreasing, for in the five years ending 1892,\nrewards were paid for 3 tigers, 11 leopards and 742 wolves. Jackals are numerous everywhere and do considerable damage to the crops, especially to maize and sugarcane. Pigs do a considerable amount of damage to crops in some villages near the river; porcupines are to be found in the Salt Range, but rarely in the plain portion of the district. Foxes and wild cats are found in the B\u00e1r jungle; the mongoose is frequently seen, and hedgehogs, rats and mice are common. The badger (bijj\u00fa) is commonly reported to be in the habit of digging into graves and feasting on dead bodies; indeed it is said to be able to make a dead body walk. Badger-baiting is a favourite amusement. Black buck are rare, but the ravine-deer is fairly common in the B\u00e1r and Thal and the lower slopes of the Salt Range. They were formerly much more numerous and old men tell how they used to run them down with relays of dogs in the clayey lands between the Thal and the hills after rain, when their feet stuck in the soft soil. The most interesting animal from the sportsman's point of view is the mountain-sheep or oor\u00ed\u00e1l (properly hure\u00e1l) which is similar to the mouflon of Corsica. It is found throughout the Salt Range right down to its base. Among its native rocks its agility is surprising. Though heavy-looking it can move at a very rapid pace and no hill-side is too steep for it. In this district, probably owing to the plentiful supply of good grazing, big horns are fairly common; $31\\frac{1}{2}$ inches is the largest of which there is any record, and horns of 27 or 28 inches are not unusual. A full grown oor\u00ed\u00e1l weighs about the same as a black buck and when cleaned makes a heavy load for a strong hill-man. Oor\u00ed\u00e1l may not be shot in the Salt Range rakhs except in accordance with licenses issued by the Deputy Commissioner. Hares are pretty common where the cultivated land adjoins the jungle, and some of the resident Maliks are fond of coursing them with greyhounds, more or less pure in breed; every precaution being taken that the hare shall not escape. The only wild monkeys in the district are a pair of lang\u00fars which have been seen on Sakesar. In fact it seems probable that these animals were really stone-martens, which are locally known as \"lang\u00fars\" and not uncommon near Sakesar.\n\nThe district with its hill, desert, rivers and riverain still holds a fair amount of mixed game. In the Salt Range chakor above 3,000 feet and sissi below are common. The gray partridge is found in many places but the black only here and there in the riverain. Blue pigeon abound, and round Sakesar the Himalayan Cushat (Palumbus Casiotis), the biggest of the pigeon tribe, breed in the summer.\nThe pin-tailed sandgrouse breeds in the Thal, but the rest of the sandgrouse tribe are migrants and only stay for a short time from the end of November to the end of February. During that period the Thal in good years is alive with birds. A few of the painted, and pallas variety are seen, but the majority are Imperial sandgrouse; one of the marvels of nature occurs when occasionally, with the whole Jhelum and its branches to choose from, all the flights for many miles select one shallow spot in a creek to drink from. The first of the migrants are the cranes who have been noticed going high over Sakesar on August 12th. Both the grey crane (Grus Cinerea) and the demoiselle crane (Anthropoides Virgo) are seen: the former predominate. Along with the grey and barheaded geese who are seldom noticed until Christmas time, they feed not only by the banks of the rivers, but on the crops in the more sparsely populated part of the colony.\n\nIn the winter ducks of many kinds swarm on the rivers, on the lakes in the Salt Range and on ponds in the jungles. The teal, shovellers and smaller kind of pochards come early and stay late. The mallard like the geese turn up with the colder weather and some birds like the red-crested pochard are seen usually at the end of the season only. Snipe and bittern are not very common. The Hoobara bustard (Hoobara macqueenii) arrives before the sandgrouse in fair numbers. The lesser bustard (Otis tetrax) is occasionally seen, and on rare occasions the Tog or great Indian bustard (Eudpodotis Edwardsi) may be seen, but seldom shot. Allied to the Hoobara is the Lesser Stone Plover (Oedienemus crepitans) which lives in the same country and is excellent eating. The local name (Kharwanak) is applied also to the curlew (Numenias arquatus) which is also good eating, when river fed, and the large Stone Plover (Aesacus recurvirostris) which is not.\n\nQuail come with the cranes at the end of August, in large numbers but in the night. They are almost the first to come and the last to leave. A few remain in the fields and bushes all the winter, but the majority travel on in flights down country to return in diminished numbers having paid toll to net, gun and hawk.\n\nThe order of departure is as follows:\u2014the Imperial sandgrouse depart at the end of February. The bustards have disappeared a fortnight later. Cranes and geese leave as the grain ripens and are all gone before the end of March. A few duck remain till the first week of April. The quail can be shot in diminishing numbers up to the 3rd week of April, and then all shooting is at\nan end till the clamour of the clanging cranes is once more heard high over Sakesar.\n\nMany other aquatic birds visit the district\u2014cormorants, coots, ibis, stilts and waders of all kinds; and the scarlet flamingo (baggy) remains on the Salt Range lakes all the year round. Plovers and lapwings of several kinds are seen in open country.\n\nThe crow and the kite are ubiquitous, the great black raven is frequently to be met with in dry tracts, and sometimes the huge adjutant-bird (lamdhang) is seen standing about in the irrigated fields. A dead bullock or camel soon attracts a number of vultures from the blue. Hawks, valuable for sporting purposes, are found in the B\u00e1r and Thal and fetch fabulous prices. In the irrigated tracts green parrots fill the air with their screeching, a golden oriole sometimes flashes through the trees, and the blue jays and scarlet-plumaged wood-peckers add gaiety to the scene. The paradise fly-catcher is generally to be seen in the garden at Sodhi; the Bee-eater is ubiquitous in the hot weather. Immense flocks of rosy pastors (tiliar), the hereditary enemy of the locust, visit the district in the hot weather, and the common house-sparrow is only too common at all times and places.\n\nSnakes are common especially perhaps in the Salt Range, the venomous kinds most frequently met with being the cobra (phaniar\u2014n\u00e1ia tripudians), the karait (sangchur\u2014bungarus caeruleus) and the eachis carinata (phissi or khapra). On the average of the five years ending 1895, Rs. 70 were annually paid as rewards for the destruction of 435 venomous snakes, and 43 persons were reported as having died from snake-bite. During the five years ending 1914, 211 persons were killed by snake-bite, but no rewards for the destruction of poisonous snakes were paid; consequently no destruction of snakes has been reported since 1910. Crocodiles (sans\u00e1r) may often be seen sunning themselves on the sand banks in the river beds, but rarely attack men or domestic animals. Lizards of various kinds are common. The small house-lizard (kunkirli) catches flies upon the walls; chameleons (saddar) and other tree-lizards scuttle up the trees, and several, including the great goh, live in holes in the ground. The sahna burrows in the B\u00e1r jungles and is often dug out by the Mussall\u00eds and jungle tribes and used for food. The skink (reg-mahi or sand-fish) is found in the sand-hills of the Thal; with its tiny feet and glittering scales it looks exactly like a small fish, and is remarkable for the brittleness of its body and for the rapidity with which it disappears in the sand. The dried skink is much in\ndemand for medicinal purposes. Most dreaded of all is the bindoa, a small ugly spotted lizard found in the hills, whose bite is more venomous than the cobra's; hence the saying 'lare bindoa te khatto toa' (if a bindoa bite a man, you may dig his grave). The little animal knows his reputation, for he does not always flee when pursued, but turns in a threatening attitude on his pursuers. However, when a specimen was sent to the Calcutta Museum it was found to be the enblepharis modicularis, allied to the Gecko, and not poisonous; and when attempt was made to verify alleged cases of its bite having proved immediately fatal, the evidence was not found to be such as to satisfy a scientific enquirer. But whatever be the truth of the matter, there is no doubt that the fear the villagers have for this lizard is real.\n\nIn the rivers the commonest fish are the r\u0101hu and dhabra, both of which go up to about 16 lbs. in weight, and the mali up to 30 lbs.; less common are the mahsher which goes up to 40 lbs., the singh\u0101ra, up to 8 lbs., the daula, up to 10 lbs., a thorny-backed fish, trekanda; and a flat fish called patri. The best for eating are the r\u0101hu, mahsher and singh\u0101ra. Fish are very little eaten by the riverside population and sell at from six to ten seers for the rupee. They are caught in nets and basket-traps, and with hooks, chiefly by the Mullah (boatmen) and by Mehra (fishermen) from Pind D\u0101dan Khan, who export a considerable quantity by train to R\u0101walpindi and Jhelum. In the torrent beds of the Salt Range, for instance at Sodhi and Kathwai, a small minnowlike fish is found which makes fair eating.\n\nLocusts (makri) sometimes visit the district in destructive numbers, generally coming up from the dry south-west. In the spring of 1891 numerous flights of locusts, which were identified as the Acridium peregrinum, the great migratory locust of North-Western India, made their appearance in the Khush\u00e1b Tahsil and deposited eggs in the Thal and along the foot of the Salt Range. Towards the end of April young locusts (p\u00e1ng) appeared in immense swarms and devoured every green thing, but fortunately the wheat crop which was unusually good was so nearly ripe that they did it very little damage. After destroying everything that was still green they ascended the Salt Range and poured upon its valleys like an invading army, attacking the ripening wheat and biting through the stalks so that the ears fell on the ground as if cut off by a sickle. The trees and bushes also suffered severely, almost the only kinds untouched being the dhrek or bakain (Melia azadarach) and the ak or mad\u00e1r (calotropis procera). The villagers were organized and endeavoured to drive back the enemy, immense numbers of whom were destroyed by\ndriving them into trenches where they were buried or into bushes where they were burned, but their numbers were so great that little impression was made. It was noticed that the young locusts (pi\u00fang) had a cannibal propensity for voraciously attacking and devouring piecemeal their dead and wounded comrades, whom indeed they seemed to prefer to any other kind of food. By the middle of June most of the survivors had developed wings, and successive flights of them took their way towards the east feeding as they went on the bushes of the B\u00e1r jungle, where also a considerable number of young locusts had been hatched. In October and November again considerable numbers were hatched in the Salt Range and along its base, but most of them were destroyed before they could do much damage. Considering the immense numbers of locusts that had infested the district, it was astonishing how little damage had been done. The grass and trees had suffered considerably and some of the latter died from the effects of the loss of their foliage and bark, and a considerable area of young cotton and b\u00e1jra was destroyed, but the wheat crop had suffered so little that it was only found necessary to remit Rs. 317 in ten villages in the Salt Range.\n\nAgain in May 1893, flights of locusts came up from the south and west and deposited eggs in the Jhal and along both banks of the Jhelum, but the young locusts were mostly destroyed before much damage was done. Since 1893, there have been no noteworthy visitations and there has been no remission of revenue on this account. Another species of locust (makkar) pecilocera picta, of a bright yellow colour with bars of brilliant blue and green and of sluggish habit, is constantly present. It is found only on the akk plant (calotropis procera) which the migratory locust will seldom touch.\n\nA sort of cricket (toka), identified as allied to the genus gryllodes, and an acridid of the genus chrotoconus known here as tridda, often do great damage to the sprouting kharif crops in April, May, and June, usually making their ravages by night. They were exceptionally numerous in 1891 when a cold wet winter was followed by a hot summer, and again in 1893 and 1915 when the seasons were similar. In 1911 the cotton-crop was so badly ravaged by boll-worm throughout the canal-irrigated area, that the crop could only be assessed at half rates. White ants (siivi) attack timber and garnered grain, which is also much subject to injury from weevils (ghun). Mosquitoes and sand-flies make life a burden in the hot weather, and house flies swarm, especially towards the beginning and end of winter. On the other hand, the honey-bee makes delicious honey from the flowers of the\nSalt Range, and in irrigated tracts the firefly flashes his electric light among the trees. Scorpions and centipedes are comparatively rare.\n\nSome parts of Shahpur District, and especially the uplands of the B\u00e1r and Thal, and the waterless, treeless tract along the foot of the Salt Range, are in the months of May and June among the hottest regions in India. In those months little rain falls and the temperature at Khush\u00e1b rises day after day to $115^\\circ$ or more in the shade, the average daily maximum for June being nearly $108^\\circ$. In the river valleys and especially where canal irrigation has moistened the soil and covered it with shady trees the temperature does not rise quite so high; yet the thermometer often stands at over $110^\\circ$ in the shade, and between $90^\\circ$ and $95^\\circ$ in the house, with the doors closed during the day. At night in this season the temperature goes down to about $85^\\circ$. When the monsoon rains commence the temperature falls considerably, and in July and August seldom goes above $105^\\circ$ in the shade, and often falls as low as $80^\\circ$ during the night. In September and October the temperature gradually falls until about the middle of the latter months, the days are no longer hot in the shade and the nights are distinctly cool. The cold season then sets in and for nearly six months the district enjoys almost perfect weather with bright days and cold nights. At intervals in January, February and March the sky clouds over and the weather is cold, raw and damp, reminding one of a northern clime. The coldest month is January, when the thermometer often stands at $60^\\circ$ in the day and goes down to freezing-point in the early morning\u2014the average nightly minimum at Khush\u00e1b being $41^\\circ$. On such nights shallow pools freeze over, and hoar-frost appears on the blades of grass and young wheat, but is soon dissipated by the rising sun. Towards the middle of April the temperature again begins to rise uncomfortably high and continues to rise till the coming of the monsoon rains in the end of June except when, at rare intervals, a refreshing shower reduces it somewhat for a day or two. The temperature of the valleys of the Salt Range is generally about 10 degrees lower than that in the plains; and at Sakesar, nearly 5,000 feet above the sea, the temperature in the hot months rarely goes above $90^\\circ$ in the shade or below $70^\\circ$, and in the house with the doors open generally stands between $85^\\circ$ and $75^\\circ$ with surprisingly small variation. In October it goes down to about $70^\\circ$ and in the winter often stands below freezing-point.\n\nThe Jhelum valley is less exposed to winds than most parts of the Punjab, and often the air is absolutely calm. In the dry\nhot weather, however, dust-storms frequently make their appearance, generally from the direction of the sandy Thal, converting daylight into almost complete darkness and sometimes blowing with such violence as to uproot large trees. In the tract along the foot of the Salt Range such dust-storms are at that season of almost daily occurrence; and at the mouths of the gorges a fierce wind blows down from the hills nearly every evening, often drying up and withering the ripening wheat. On the top of Sakesar the air is hardly ever at rest and strong squalls or whirlwinds are frequent.\n\nThe average annual rainfall varies considerably for different parts of the district and decreases rapidly as one goes south-west away from the Himalayas. It is also somewhat heavier near the rivers and in the Salt Range than in the dry hot uplands. At Midh in the Chenab Valley it averages 15 inches. On the Jhelum it averages 16 inches at Mi\u00e1ni and Bhera, 14 inches at Shahpur, and 12 inches at S\u00e1hiw\u00e1l. At Khush\u00e1b on the west bank of the river the rainfall is about an inch less than at Shahpur, which is much better off in the matter of moisture and vegetation. At Mitha Tiw\u00e1na on the edge of the Thal the rainfall again averages 10 inches, while at N\u00farpur in the middle of the desert, the average is about the same. In the Salt Range at Naushahra the average is 18 inches, while at Sakesar it is 23 inches.\n\nTaking 15 inches as the average rainfall for the Jhelum Valley, it may be said that 11 inches fall in the summer and 4 in the winter months. April and May have rather more than half an inch each, an inch falls in June, 4 inches in July, 3\u00bd in August and 1\u00bd in September. October and November have little more than half an inch between them, December is almost entirely rainless, and January, February, and March have slightly over 1 inch each. The rainy season commences towards the end of June or beginning of July and lasts for little more than two months. On the rainfall of July and August depends the sowing of the autumn crop. Rain in September is very favourable both for maturing the autumn crop and for moistening the ground for the wheat sowings. The spring crop once in the ground is chiefly dependent on the showers of January and February. It is worthy of remark that while the total annual rainfall is almost the same as for the Hiss\u00e1r District near the R\u00e1jp\u00fat\u00e1na Desert, Shahpur gets 4 inches of rain in the winter months, while Hiss\u00e1r gets little more than 2, and this, combined with the lower temperature of Shahpur, renders its climate much more favourable for growing wheat than that of Hiss\u00e1r.\nBut while these are the averages it must not be forgotten that the chief characteristic of the rainfall here is not its scantiness, but its variableness both from year to year and from place to place. For example, at Bhera in 1891-92 the total annual fall was only 5 inches, and in the following year it was 24 inches. In the six winter months of the former year only half an inch fell and in the corresponding period of the latter year 6 inches. Again, in July 1908 only an inch fell at Shahpur while 5\u00bd inches fell at Khush\u00e1b, only 8 miles off. In fact much of the rainfall comes from partial thunderstorms, often of great violence and excellent rain may have fallen in one village, while another a few miles off may have got none. Generally speaking, it may be said that the scantier the total annual rainfall the more variable it is. It is less variable at Bhera and Mi\u00e1ni than at Shahpur and S\u00e1hiw\u00e1l. It is exceedingly variable in the Thal and along the foot of the Salt Range, but comparatively certain in the valleys within the range.\n\nThe value of opportune rainfall to the crops cannot be exaggerated. An inch of rain over the district may be literally worth lakhs of rupees to the peasantry. An hour's thunderstorm may put thousands into the pockets of one village. An exceptional shower in April or May is very favourable for the sowing of cotton or early bajra. Good rain in the usually almost rainless months of November or December enables the peasants to sow thousands of acres of rain-land which would ordinarily remain barren. On the other hand, the failure or delay of the usual monsoon rains leads to a great contraction of the area under the autumn crops and to a scarcity of grass and fodder of all kinds. Should the monsoon rains cease early, the autumn crop dries up, and the ground is not sufficiently moistened for the wheat sowings. Again when, as happened in 1890, 1892 and 1915 the winter rains hold off, much of the wheat fails to come to maturity and the spring crop is a very poor one. Unusually heavy rain in April and May, such as fell in 1893 and 1907, does great damage to the ungarnered grain on the threshing floors, while if the rain comes while the crop is still standing, as happened in 1915, the outturn of grain is much diminished. The prosperity of the district, and especially of those parts of it which are chiefly dependent on the local rainfall, varies very greatly from year to year according to the amount and opportuneness of the rainfall.\n\nSnow sometimes falls on Sakesar, but very seldom on the lower parts of the Salt Range, as it did in the exceptionally cold and wet winter of 1892-93. Hail-storms are frequent all over\nthe district, but very partial in their effects. They are most to be dreaded just before the wheat harvest. The most severe in recent years fell in April 1893, crossing the district in almost a straight line from the Salt Range to the Chen\u00e1b and leaving behind it a path of devastation 50 miles long and 3 or 4 miles broad. The wheat and poppy crops were then ripening and that afternoon's storm caused a loss to the peasants, over whose fields it passed of, at least a lakh of rupees. In April 1915, the wheat crop in the south of Shahpur and Sargodha Tahsils was practically ruined in the same way.\n\nBy far the greatest flood within living memory occurred on 20th July 1893 on the Jhelum river: the water spread in some places as far as 10 miles beyond the ordinary river channel; 15 human beings and upwards of 1,000 cattle were drowned; the unstored grain and fodder were entirely washed away, and the growing kharif crops destroyed over a very large area; 31,000 houses were reported to have been ruined, and large stores of grain garnered from the preceding bumper crop were irretrievably damaged. The monetary loss was estimated at eight lakhs of rupees, in addition to which there was a very heavy mortality in the ensuing fever season, and the soil in several localities along the lines of low level was permanently soured. In the spring of 1907 there were unseasonable floods, which did considerable damage to the ungarnered crops, and in April 1915 some of the lowlying lands suffered in the same way, but no flood has eclipsed the memory of 1893, which is everywhere spoken of as the \"year of the big flood\" (waddi kding).\n\nThere have been no serious earthquakes in recent times, but the shock, generally known as the Kangra Valley earthquake of 1905, was felt throughout the district, and in the spring of 1915 there was a sharp shock, which damaged the domes of the Shah Shams shrine at Shahpur, and caused the collapse of a few houses in Shahpur town.\n\nSection B\u2014History.\n\nBut little is known of the early history of this part of the country, and there are very few archaeological remains to enable us to arrive at any certain conclusion regarding its former inhabitants. Some of them have been described by General Cunningham in his Archaeological Survey Reports, Volume V, pages 79 to 85, and Volume XIV, pages 33 to 41, and in his ancient Geography, pages 155 to 159. The most ancient remains are probably those to be found in the Salt Range, among them the most interesting being the ruins at Amb, 5 miles south of Sakesar,\nwhich have been described by General Cunningham in his Report, Volume XIV, page 33. Here, on a hill well inside the range and defended by steep cliffs from attack from the direction of the plain country lying to the south, are the remains of a massive fort in very fair preservation, with the ruins of three temples, one large and two small ones, and the walls of a large number of houses, which show that the place must have been one of considerable size and importance. General Cunningham mentions that the temples are all of the Kashmirian style, and are almost certainly of late date as all the arches have cinquefoil instead of trefoil heads, which is the only form in Kashmir. He thought therefore that their most probable date was from 800 to 950 A.D. during the rule of the Brahman dynasty of Kabul.\n\nThere is a tradition among the present inhabitants that an inscribed stone was found among the ruins at Amb in the early years of our rule, and was sent on a camel to Leiah, which was then the head-quarters of the district, but unfortunately no trace of that stone can now be found. In 1888 three pieces of sculpture were found near the entrance to one of the temples. These have been deposited in the Lahore Museum. The ruins at Amb are supposed to be the most southern example of the ancient and very peculiar Kashmiri architecture. They were declared to be protected monuments by Punjab Government's notification No. 453, dated 25th July 1911.\n\nOn the hills a little to the east of Amb may be seen the remains of a long wall with a gateway, which may have been erected for defensive purposes, probably against the inhabitants of the plains, and on the very top of Sakesar itself are the ruins of what probably was a small Buddhist shrine. Throughout this part of the Salt Range one frequently comes across oblong platforms built of squared stones, many of them having inserted in one side in the form of a cross four stones of a different colour from the rest of the structure. The present inhabitants cannot say what they are but they are evidently tombs of a Hindu or Buddhistic period. They would probably repay the trouble of a systematic search. A number of them may be seen on the road from Kathwai to Sakesar.*\n\nAt Khura in the Salt Range, about two miles north-east of Kathwai, there was found in 1888 among some ruins an inscribed stone which was sent to the Lahore Museum. The inscription was deciphered by Professor B\u00fchler, who gives a facsimile and\n\n* Sir Aurel Stein has visited the Shahpur Salt Range and investigated the remains there, but unfortunately no notes on his researches have been published, and the Archaeological Department are unable to add anything to the account of Mr. Wilson.\ntranslation of it in the Epigraphia Indica, Part V, for October 1889. He states that the characters resemble those found in the older Buddhist nail-headed inscriptions of the Gupta period, and that the language is a mixed dialect, incorrect Sanskrit, strongly modified through the influence of the Vernacular Prakrit. The inscription bears the statement that it was incised in the reign of Toramana Shaha Jauvla, who seems to have been an independent king, possibly of Turkish origin. It records the construction of a Buddhist monastery by one Rota-siddhaviddhi for the teachers of the Mahi-sasaka School. It mentions a town called Naschira, which may possibly be the place now called Naushahra, an important village in the S\u00fcn valley, about 7 miles from where the stone was found. Professor B\u00fchler, on palaeographical grounds, assigns the inscription to the fourth or the fifth century.\n\nIn 1886 in the hills a mile or two from the ruins of Amb a shepherd, while watching his flock, employed his leisure time in knocking down a bank of earth with his stick, and noticed among the d\u00e9bris an earthen vessel, inside which he found 549 small coins. These were sent to Calcutta and were there deciphered by Dr. H\u0153rnl\u00e9 as belonging to different kings who reigned between the years 1060 and 1215 A.D., the most numerous being those of Maizz-ud-d\u00edn, Muhammad bin Sam, conqueror of India, 1193-1205 A.D. and of Sri Chahad Deva, R\u00e1ja of Ajmir, about 1215 A.D.\n\nAgain in 1888 at the village of Chitta at the foot of the Sakesar hill a man while ploughing turned up an earthen vessel containing 498 coins, all but one being of the \"Horseman and Bull type\" and belonging to Saif-ud-d\u00edn Hasan Qurlagh who was one of the leading generals of Jal\u00e1l-ud-d\u00edn Maukbarnin, the last of the Kharizmian Kings in the beginning of the thirteenth century A.D. Another hoard of 395 coins of the same ruler was discovered in the following year on a hill-side near the same village of Chitta. About the same time 304 coins were found near the village of Sodhi, also in the Salt Range, all of which with one exception were coins of the Path\u00e1n Sultan of Delhi, Ghiy\u00e1s-ud-din Balban, who reigned from 1265 to 1287 A.D.\n\nIn the B\u00e1r tract between the valleys of the Chen\u00e1b and Jhelum rivers there are some 270 mounds of earth mixed with loose bricks and fragments of pottery which mark the sites of former towns and villages. It is unlikely that those sites were all inhabited at any one time. More probably they were built upon when the rivers flowed in one or other of the old channels still existing in the B\u00e1r, and as a river moved further to the east or west the population gradually followed it and deserted the old\nsites for new ones nearer the new course of the river. This theory is supported by the fact that old wells found near these old sites have often only 25 feet or so of brickwork, while the present underground water-level is over 60 feet, showing that when the wells were made, water was much nearer the surface, probably because the river was at the time near the site. It is improbable that the population of the whole district was even larger than it is at the present day.\n\nAmong the most extensive of these deserted sites are those near Vijjhi 3 miles west of Mi\u00e1ni, Takht Haz\u00e1ra on the Chen\u00e1b, Chak S\u00e1hnu 13 miles east of Shahpur and Panj P\u00edr 10 miles south of S\u00e1h\u00edw\u00e1l. Vijjhi is described in the Archaeological Survey Reports, Volume XIV, page 40, by General Cunningham, who mentions six tombs of nogaja\u2019s or \u201cgiant martyrs,\u201d and says he obtained here two coins of Indo-Scythian Princes.* Takht Haz\u00e1ra was once, according to tradition, a large city called Jah\u00e1ng\u00edrnagar Takht Haz\u00e1ra, because it covered a thousand acres. The numerous mounds that mark the site show that it must have been of considerable size. In the jamabandi of the Sark\u00e1r Do\u00e1ba Chaj given in the A\u00edn Akbari, the Mah\u00e1l of Haz\u00e1ra is stated to have paid a revenue of 46,89,136 d\u00e1ms or Rs. 1,17,228. R\u00e1njha, or more properly Dhido of the R\u00e1njha tribe, the hero of the well-known romance \u201cR\u00e1njha and Hir,\u201d belonged to H\u00e1zara. There are a large number of old wells, most of them small and insignificant, a mosque and the tombs of several faq\u00edrs, the chief of which is the tomb of a Mughal faq\u00edr called Shah\u00e1m-ud-d\u00edn, but none of them of any great architectural interest. The town is said to have been deserted about 200 years ago, and after remaining uninhabited for about a century was again occupied by the ancestors of the present inhabitants about 1785 A.D. Chak S\u00e1hnu is probably the site of the Chak S\u00e1ni which is mentioned in history as having been sacked and burned by N\u00far-ud-d\u00edn, the General of Ahmad Shah Abd\u00e1l\u00ed. Panj P\u00edr must also have been at one time a large town; according to a Hindu story it was one of the resting places of the five P\u00e1ndavas, but the Mussalm\u00e1n residents ascribe its sacredness to five saints, some of whose graves, nine yards long, are pointed out in the vicinity. None of these mounds have yielded any old sculptures or inscriptions, and evidently the population that inhabited them in their days of prosperity had not reached any very high stage of civilization. Few coins have been found in them earlier than the days of the Mughal Empire.\n\n* This site, locally known as Chak Sabz, was declared a Protected Monument by Punjab Government's notification No. 849, dated 9th December 1909.\nThe only architectural remains in the plains part of the district are of comparatively recent date. Many of them, such as the mosque at Bhera, the w\u00e1ns or stair-cased wells at Gunj\u00ed\u00e1l and Had\u00e1li, and the remains of a massive masonry dam across the mouth of the Katha gorge, evidently built for the purpose of distributing the water of the stream, are all ascribed to Sher Sh\u00e1h, King of Delhi, about 1540 A.D. There are a few tombs of Muhammadan days near Khush\u00e1b and at other places in the district, but none of any architectural value. At Sh\u00e1h Y\u00fasaf, 7 miles south of Shahpur, there is a small but elegant tomb, ornamented outside by coloured tiles, which was erected in 900 A.H. to the memory of a holy man of that name, whose descendants still reside at the spot and subsist on the offerings of worshippers.\n\nThe only buildings which are worth active efforts to preserve them are (1) the temples at Amb, (2) the nogaja tombs at Vijjhi and Panj P\u00edr, (3) the w\u00e1n or b\u00e1oli at Gunj\u00ed\u00e1l, (4) the mosque at Bhera, (5) the tomb at Sh\u00e1h Yusaf and (6) the most elegant of the tombs at Khush\u00e1b.\n\nThe political history of the district may conveniently be divided into three periods. The first, that which preceded the downfall of the Mughal Empire; the second, the brief space occupied by the successive inroads of the Afgh\u00e1ns, followed by the rapid acquisition of power by the Sikhs; and the last, the period during which, by a happy admixture of boldness and artifice, the young leader of Sukar Chakia misl succeeded in making himself master of the whole of the Punjab, from the banks of the Sutlej to the mountains of Sulem\u00e1n.\n\nThe first may be dismissed with a few words. A tract of country not naturally rich, and far removed from the high road between Hindust\u00e1n and the countries beyond its northern frontier, would not be the scene of events of sufficient magnitude to leave a lasting impress on the minds of the people, and hence tradition has preserved little that refers to so remote a period. All that is known is, that during the latter years of Muhammad Sh\u00e1h\u2019s reign the affairs of Bhera, and the surrounding country as far south as Shahpur, were administered by R\u00e1ja Sal\u00e1mat R\u00e1i, a Khatri of Anand clan; that Khush\u00e1b and its dependencies were under the management of Naw\u00e1b Ahmady\u00e1r Kh\u00e1n; that the tracts lying to the south of the district, and along the Chen\u00e1b formed part of the territory delegated to the charge of Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja Kaura Mal, then Governor of Mult\u00e1n; and that the Thal formed part of the j\u00e1g\u00edr of the descendants of the Biloch founders of the\ntwo Deras. To this period succeeded one of [anarchy]. The weakness of the Mughal Government had invited attack from without, and fostered insurrection within; wave after wave of invasion for nearly thirty years poured down over the defenceless country, and in the intervals the Sikhs made good every opportunity afforded them by the weakness of the government, to enrich themselves at the expense of their more peaceable neighbours. The remote position of this tract of country did not altogether save it from the calamities incident on such a state of things. In the year 1757 a force under N\u00far-ud-d\u00edn, Bamizai, deputed by Ahmad Shah to assist his son Tim\u00far in repelling the Mahraittas, crossing the river Jhelum at Khush\u00e1b, marched up the left bank of the river. The proceedings of this man may be taken as a type of the excesses committed by the invading armies; and some idea will be formed of the amount of misery caused by these inroads. N\u00far-ud-d\u00edn, finding that the inhabitants would not pay the large ransoms demanded of them, successively plundered and laid waste with fire and sword three of the largest towns of the district. Two of these, Bhera and Mi\u00e1ni, rose again on their ruins, without however completely recovering the shock they had sustained; but of the third, Chak S\u00e1hnu, nothing remains but a mound of earth and potsherds.\n\nAbout this time Naw\u00e1b Ahmady\u00e1r Khan died, and Khush\u00e1b was added to the territory under the charge of R\u00e1ja Sal\u00e1mat R\u00e1i. But the latter had not held it many years before he was treacherously put to death by Abb\u00e1s Kh\u00e1n, Khattak, who held possession of the Salt Range and Pind D\u00e1dan Khan on the part of Ahmad Shah. Abb\u00e1s Kh\u00e1n then seized Bhera; but his attempt to make himself master of the surrounding country was foiled by the determination shown by the widow of the murdered Governor, who shut herself up in the fort of Ch\u00e1wa, while her nephew, following her example, held out in his stronghold of Fatehgarh, close to Bhera itself. These events occurred in 1760; and before Abb\u00e1s Kh\u00e1n had time to subdue his opponents, he was himself thrown into prison as a revenue defaulter, when the former status was restored, Fateh Singh obtaining possession of the tract previously held by his uncle, and Muhammad Naw\u00e1z Kh\u00e1n succeeding his father in the government of the country north of the Jhelum.\n\nAfter the final successes of the Sikh commonwealth against Ahmad Shah in 1767, the whole of the Salt Range was overrun and appropriated by Chattar Singh of the Sukar Chakia misl, while the Bhang\u00eds taking possession of the tract of country\nbetween those hills and the Chen\u00e1b, as far nearly as S\u00e1h\u00edw\u00e1l, parcelled it out among themselves after their usual fashion. The division of the portion comprised within this district was as follows: the zails of Midh and M\u00fasa Ch\u00faha, as dependencies of K\u00e1dirabad, were retained as their own share by Ganda Singh and Jhanda Singh, the leaders of the misl. Mi\u00e1ni was assigned to T\u00e1ra Singh, and Bhera with Ahmedabad fell to the lot of M\u00e1n Singh, from whom they passed in 1769 to Dhauna Singh and Charat Singh of the same confederacy.\n\nThe Muhammadan chieftains of S\u00e1h\u00edw\u00e1l, Mitha Tiw\u00e1na and Khush\u00e1b had some time previously assumed independence, and, though hard pressed, were able generally to resist the encroachments of their new neighbours, the Sikhs. South of the Jhelum, however, the Bhang\u00eds had succeeded in wresting from Muham- mad Kh\u00e1n of S\u00e1h\u00edw\u00e1l the greater part of his possessions; but after the chief\u2019s death, his son Fateh Kh\u00e1n drove out the Sikhs, and by degrees established his authority over nearly the whole of the tract afterwards included in the Shahpur Tahsil. But these changes brought no repose; might was the only test of right; and, in the absence of any general controlling authority, the country became a prey to the ambition of rival chiefs struggling for supremacy. It would be tedious and profitless to record all this petty warfare. Only those occurrences need be mentioned from which permanent changes of possession resulted.\n\nAcross the river Jhelum the Tiw\u00e1nas under Malik Sher Kh\u00e1n made themselves masters of N\u00farpur and the surrounding country, and after the death of Gul Jah\u00e1nnia of Warchha succeeded in establishing a partial authority over the Aw\u00e1ns along the base of the Salt Range. They also wrested Shekhow\u00e1l and several other villages on the right bank of the Jhelum from the Biloch Chief of S\u00e1h\u00edw\u00e1l. But the Malik\u2019s attempt to reduce Khush\u00e1b was unsuccessful, for although Lal Kh\u00e1n was killed in the defence of the town, the Tiw\u00e1nas were driven off, and J\u00e1fir Kh\u00e1n, the deceased chieftain\u2019s son and successor, thenceforth remained in possession, until Ranj\u00edt Singh absorbed the taluka into the rest of his dominions.\n\nSouth of the Jhelum, as described above, the Bhang\u00eds had possessed themselves of the whole Do\u00e1b east of Shahpur; while to the west of that place as far as Nihang the country owned the authority of the Chief of S\u00e1h\u00edw\u00e1l. But in Shahpur itself, a colony of Sayads, under Ghul\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h, established a semi-independent authority,* and this they were allowed to retain\n\n*The descendants of Ghul\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h and his father Nathu Sh\u00e1h still hold the greater part of the land in Shahpur and its neighbourhood.\nunmolested by their more powerful neighbours, owing doubtless to the reverence in which they were held as the descendants of a renowned saint. The remainder of the Do\u00e1b, to the junction of the two rivers, was held by the Si\u00e1l Chiefs of Jhang, Izzat Bakhsh Reh\u00e1n, a powerful zam\u00ednd\u00e1r of those parts, being their Deputy in K\u00e1low\u00e1l. Such was the status of possession when the Sukar Chakia confederacy under Maha Singh began to acquire the ascendancy and the power of the Bhangis to decline. The subsequent history of the district consists of a series of encroachments on the part of Maha Singh and his renowned son Ranj\u00edt Singh, until the whole country was incorporated with the dominions of the latter.\n\nBy the deaths of Sard\u00e1rs Jhanda Singh and Ganda Singh, the Bhangi confederacy was left without a head; and Maha Singh, having joined his forces to those of the Kanhy\u00e1 misl, found no difficulty in making himself master of K\u00e1dirabad. By this event, which occurred in 1781, the taluk\u00e1s of Midh and Musa fell into his hands, and two years after, he succeeded in taking Mi\u00e1ni and its dependencies from T\u00e1ra Singh, Bhangi. For some time now there was a pause in the tide of conquest. Ten years after the event last recorded, Maha Singh died, leaving his son Ranj\u00edt Singh, a boy of thirteen years; and it was long before the latter had sufficiently established his authority round Lahore, to allow him to think of making conquests so far from the capital. But the process of annexation though slow was sure, and the wily young chief was never in want of a pretext for adding to his possession. Bhera was coveted, and the reason assigned for interference in its affairs was the tyranny of Jodh Singh, who had succeeded to the family conquests on the death of his father Dhanna Singh; with this plausible excuse, Ranj\u00edt Singh marched from Mi\u00e1ni in 1803, and having obtained possession of the fort by means of a stratagem, the person of Jodh Singh was secured, and the young M\u00e1h\u00e1r\u00e1ja entered unopposed into possession of the country lying on both sides of the river as far as Jh\u00e1wari.\n\nThe next move was against the Biloch Chiefs of S\u00e1h\u00edw\u00e1l and Khush\u00e1b. In 1804 Ranj\u00edt Singh had placed the former under contribution, and the tribute, which at first was almost nominal, was afterwards raised to twelve thousand rupees a year. The increased demand was not met with promptitude, and this furnished the M\u00e1h\u00e1r\u00e1ja with the pretext he was in search of. Accordingly, in 1809, a force was organized, and Ranj\u00edt Singh marched for S\u00e1h\u00edw\u00e1l. Having taken up a position at Mangow\u00e1l, one march from that place, he\nsent Sard\u00e1r Attar Singh to bring the Biloch Chief to his presence. But Fateh Kh\u00e1n, taught by experience, suspected treachery, and excused himself from obeying the call. On receiving, however, the Sard\u00e1r's solemn assurance that no harm should befall the boy, he sent his son Langar Kh\u00e1n with a handsome offering to the camp of the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja. To divert suspicion, Ranj\u00edt Singh received the boy very graciously, and having dismissed him with rich presents and assurance of his continued friendship for his father, he retraced his steps and marched against J\u00e1\u015bir Kh\u00e1n. Fateh Kh\u00e1n, falling into the trap laid for him, dismissed his forces to their homes, and before he had time to make fresh preparations for resistance, Ranj\u00edt Singh, flushed with his success before Khush\u00e1b of which place he had made himself master after a siege of only eight days, suddenly appeared before S\u00e1hiw\u00e1l and took the place by a coup-de-main. The chief was himself carried off a prisoner to Lahore, and the new conquered territory given in j\u00e1gir to the heir-apparent, Kharrak Singh. Thus fell Khush\u00e1b and S\u00e1hiw\u00e1l; and at the same time the smaller possessions of the Shahpur Sayads and of Budh Singh, Bhangi, around Bakkar, were added to the rapidly increasing territory under the sway of the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja. In the year following, the talukas of Faruka and Kalow\u00e1l fell into his hands, together with the remainder of the country which had been subject to the authority of the Si\u00e1l Chiefs of Jhang.\n\nThere remained now only the possessions of the Maliks of Mitha Tiw\u00e1na, and these, too, soon shared the common fate. A well-equipped force was despatched against them under Misr D\u00edw\u00e1n Chand in 1816. The Tiw\u00e1na Malik retired to N\u00farpur, in the heart of the Thal, thinking that the scarcity of water and supplies might prevent the Sikh army from effecting its object. But all obstacles disappeared before the energy of the Sikh commander, who sank wells as he advanced, so that after a time the Tiw\u00e1nas, finding resistance hopeless, abandoned the place and took refuge with their old enemy, the Naw\u00e1b of Dera \u00cdsmail Khan, who had not the generosity however to forget their former rivalry in pity for the fallen fortunes of the Tiw\u00e1na Chiefs, but plundered them and turned them out. After this, for nearly two years, Malik Kh\u00e1n Muhammad and his sons wandered from place to place, subsisting on the charity of their neighbours; but finding this kind of life insupportable, they determined on making an attempt to recover their former possessions. An appeal made to their fellow-clansmen was heartily responded to, and, at the head of this irregular force, they\nappeared suddenly before the walls of their native town. The Sikh garrison, completely taken by surprise, abandoned the place and fled, and the Maliks were once more masters of the land of their ancestors. Their triumph was, however, but short-lived. In the early part of 1818, the ousted Governor returned with a strong force, and the Maliks were a second time compelled to fly. The possessions of the Tiw\u00e1na Chiefs were then given in j\u00e1g\u00edr to the famous Hari Singh, Nalwa, and were held by him till his death at Pesh\u00e1war on the 30th April 1837.\n\nThe attempt made by Kh\u00e1n Muhammad served to convince Ranjit Singh that it would be bad policy to drive the Tiw\u00e1nas to desperation; when therefore the Malik repaired to Lahore to tender his submission he was well received, and a liberal provision made for the support of the family. Villages on the left bank of the Jhelum, yielding ten thousand rupees a year, were assigned in j\u00e1g\u00edr and several of the chief's relations and dependents were taken into the service of the State. Matters remained in this state, the elders living quietly on their j\u00e1g\u00edr, while the younger members of the family with their contingents served with the army whenever called on to do so, till the death of Hari Singh before Jamrud. In the interim the old Malik Kh\u00e1n Muhammad, and his elder son Ahmady\u00e1r Kh\u00e1n had died, and Malik Khud\u00e1y\u00e1r Kh\u00e1n, the younger son, with his nephew K\u00e1dir Bakhsh, were thus left as the representatives of the family. The former had had the good fortune, some time before, to place R\u00e1ja Gul\u00e1b Singh under a deep obligation, which resulted in a close friendship between them, and was the means of introducing the Malik at Court, where, befriended by the R\u00e1ja and the latter's brother, the prime minister, Khud\u00e1y\u00e1r Kh\u00e1n and his son, the well-known Fateh Kh\u00e1n, soon rose to positions of great favour.\n\nFateh Kh\u00e1n was thus favourably situated when the news of the death of Hari Singh reached Lahore. He lost no time in obtaining from his patron, in his own name, the farm of the ancestral tal\u00fakas of Mitha Tiw\u00e1na; and his father dying about the same time, he was left the acknowledged head of the tribe. From this time till the unprovoked aggressions of the Sikh army led to the first Sikh War, Fateh Kh\u00e1n took a prominent part in the politics of the country, and his love of intrigue found ample scope in the confusion into which the affairs of the State were thrown after the deaths, in rapid succession, of Ranjit Singh, his son and grandson. For some time Fateh Kh\u00e1n remained faithful to the side of his patron R\u00e1ja Dhi\u00e1n Singh, and reaped\nthe reward of his attachment in ever-increasing grants of territory in farm. But ere long the prime minister was assassinated, and suspicion of complicity in the deed having fallen on the Malik, he retired to Bannu to escape the vengeance of R\u00e1ja H\u00edra Singh, the son of the murdered man. Soon after, emerging from his retreat, the restless Malik created a diversion in favour of Sard\u00e1r Jaw\u00e1har Singh, to whose party he had now attached himself, by raising an insurrection in his native country and making himself master of Mitha Tiw\u00e1na; but the expedition failed, and Fateh Kh\u00e1n, being ejected from the town by a Sikh force under Sard\u00e1r Mangal Singh, was forced to take refuge in Bah\u00e1walpur, where he remained, till the death of H\u00edra Singh, in 1844, allowed him to come forth from his asylum.\n\nThe rest of the Malik's story is soon told. During Jaw\u00e1har Singh's brief tenure of power, Fateh Kh\u00e1n enjoyed unbounded authority, the services of so unscrupulous a partisan being, in the existing state of affairs, beyond price. But bad times were coming for the Malik. His patron was put to death by the army, and his enemies, headed by R\u00e1j\u00e1s Teja Singh and D\u00edna N\u00e1th, succeeded to power, and were not slow in gratifying their malice. He was called on to give an account of the revenues of the large tracts of county of which he had held the management, and was brought in a defaulter to the extent of several lakhs of rupees. Unable to meet this heavy demand, he was thrown into prison, where he remained till Lieutenant (afterwards Sir Herbert) Edwardes, thinking he would be of use on the frontier, obtained his liberation and ultimately, when the Mult\u00e1n rebellion broke out, sent him to relieve Lieutenant Taylor in the charge of Bannu. The Sikh troops soon after broke out into open mutiny, and besieged Fateh Kh\u00e1n with his Muhammadan levies in the fort. The Malik held out bravely, till the supply of water failed, when, seeing that the defence could be no longer protracted, he came out and was shot down while boldly challenging the best man of the Sikhs to meet him in single combat.\n\nWhen this occurred, Malik Fateh Sher Kh\u00e1n, the son of Fateh Kh\u00e1n, and Malik Sher Muhammad Kh\u00e1n, the son of the deceased Malik's first cousin K\u00e1dir Bakhsh, were serving under Major Edwardes' orders before Mult\u00e1n. Both did good service; the former remaining with Major Edwardes, while the latter was detached to follow on the tracks of the Bannu force then in full march to join Sher Singh, and to endeavour to restore order in his native district. In the execution of this commission, Sher Muhammad Kh\u00e1n drove out the Sikh garrisons, and made himself master in rapid succession of the principal towns and strong-\nholds in this part of the country beginning with Mitha Tiw\u00e1na and ending with S\u00e1h\u00edw\u00e1l; and added to his other services, by collecting a portion of the revenue and remitting it to Major Taylor, who was then employed in restoring order along the frontier. Nor must the services of Malik S\u00e1hib Kh\u00e1n, the uncle of Sher Muhammad Kh\u00e1n and a gallant member of this family, be forgotten. He too served with Major Edwardes' Irregulars, and was afterwards employed with Sard\u00e1r Langar Kh\u00e1n of S\u00e1h\u00edw\u00e1l and others, in putting to flight the force headed by the rebel Bh\u00e1i Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j Singh, and in reducing Chiniot. In short, this family has always shown itself actively loyal in seasons of disturbance, and it is only in times of peace, when the naturally jealous dispositions of its members have full play, that their internal feuds render them a source of annoyance to all around them.\n\nAfter the fall of Mult\u00e1u and the overthrow of the Sikhs at Gujr\u00e1t the Tiw\u00e1na Maliks had time to look about them. They knew that they were to be rewarded, but the question was, who was to receive the lion's share as the head of the tribe? Sher Muhammad Kh\u00e1n claimed the turban, as the descendant of the elder branch, while Fateh Sher Kh\u00e1n rested his title on the acknowledged pre-eminence of his father, Fateh Kh\u00e1n. The dispute was eventually settled through the mediation of friends. It was decided that in point of rank they should be on an equality one with the other, and that in all the material benefits that might accrue to them as representatives of the tribe, both should share alike, and this agreement has since been acted on.\n\nThe Tiw\u00e1na Maliks were well rewarded. Soon after annexation they preferred a claim to a fourth of the revenues of the N\u00farpur and Mitha Tiw\u00e1na tal\u00fakas and in consideration of their loyalty and good services the claim was admitted, and villages yielding Rs 6,000 a year were granted in j\u00e1g\u00edr to each, to be held by them and their heirs in perpetuity. In addition to these grants, life pensions of Rs. 5,000 and Rs. 3,240 were conferred respectively on Maliks Fateh Sher Kh\u00e1n and Sher Muhammad Kh\u00e1n, a pension of Rs. 480 a year was, at the same time, granted to Malik S\u00e1hib Kh\u00e1n. Lastly for their services during the mutinies, the Maliks obtained the following rewards: Maliks Fateh Sher Kh\u00e1n and S\u00e1hib Kh\u00e1n life j\u00e1g\u00edrs of twelve hundred rupees each, and Malik Sher Muhammad Kh\u00e1n one of six hundred rupees. To these substantial gifts was annexed the much coveted and highly prized title of Kh\u00e1n Bah\u00e1dur.\nIt is now time to return to Sard\u00e1r Fateh Kh\u00e1n of S\u00e1h\u00edw\u00e1l, who was left a prisoner at Lahore. In accordance with his usual custom, Ranjit Singh after a while released his prisoner, giving him a j\u00e1g\u00edr first in Jhang and then in Ahmadabad, near Pind D\u00e1dan Khan, stipulating, however, that Fateh Kh\u00e1n was to remain at court. But, after a life of independence, the Biloch Chief was ill-fitted to play the courtier, his proud spirit chafed at the confinement and, like the Tiw\u00e1na Malik, he was tempted to strike a blow for independence. He applied to the Naw\u00e1b of Mankera for assistance. The request was favourably entertained, and the two Chiefs, with their combined forces, actually started to attempt the recovery of S\u00e1h\u00edw\u00e1l. But fear of the consequences to himself of failure overcame the Naw\u00e1b\u2019s desire to assist his fellow-clansman, and abandoning Fateh Kh\u00e1n to his fate, he precipitately retreated to his stronghold of Mankera. Fateh Kh\u00e1n, seeing that he had committed himself beyond power of recall, and that now he had nothing to hope for from Ranjit Singh, fled to Mult\u00e1n, and soon after took refuge in Bah\u00e1walpur, where he died in 1819.\n\nLangar Kh\u00e1n, the son of the deceased Chief, a lad of fourteen years of age, was left a pensioner on the bounty of the Naw\u00e1b, and remained at Bah\u00e1walpur till 1822, when Ranjit Singh hearing, while on a visit at Mult\u00e1n, that Fateh Kh\u00e1n was dead, sent for Langar Kh\u00e1n, and gave him a j\u00e1g\u00edr of two thousand rupees a year with a personal allowance of three rupees a day. The j\u00e1g\u00edr was afterwards (in 1838) increased to three thousand rupees, and the allowance to five rupees a day. Langar Kh\u00e1n with his men formed part of the Sikh contingent which, under Captain (afterwards Sir H.) Lawrence, accompanied General McCaskill\u2019s division in Pollock\u2019s advance on K\u00e1b\u00fal. Langar Kh\u00e1n also served with distinction under Major Edwardes\u2019 orders during the Mult\u00e1n rebellion. After annexation, as a reward for these services, the family j\u00e1g\u00edr, valued at three thousand rupees a year, was released in perpetuity, and a life pension of twelve hundred rupees granted to Langar Kh\u00e1n. This Chief died in 1853, and was followed to his grave in 1862 by the eldest of his three sons Muhammad Hai\u00e1t Kh\u00e1n.\n\nThere is yet one set of circumstances to be referred to, and then the early history of the principal families of this part of the country may be said to be complete. It will be remembered that on Ahmad Shah\u2019s final retirement, the Sukar Chakias, under the grandfather of Ranj\u00edt Singh, possessed themselves of the greater part of the Salt Range. The status in this respect\nremained undisturbed till 1827, when the members of this confederation, among whom the conquered tract had been originally parcelled out, having fallen out among themselves, Ranjit Singh resumed their shares and divided them among his favourites; the S\u00fan tal\u00faka falling to the share of Hari Singh, by whom it was held till his death in 1837. On the occurrence of this event, it was given by the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja to his old friend and playfellow, and afterwards one of the most successful of his Generals, Sard\u00e1r Gurmukh Singh, L\u00e1mba, and it was one of the few gifts of which this brave old man had not been despoiled by the envy and hatred of the Jammu family when we took the country. The majority of the villages constituting the tal\u00faka were then resumed, but the estate of Naushahra, worth rather more than four thousand rupees a year, was released in perpetuity. Sard\u00e1r Gurmukh Singh died in 1853, and was succeeded by his son, Attar Singh.\n\nThe following account of the events of 1857 is taken from the Punjab Mutiny Report. Shahpur was then the headquarters of the customs line in connection with the Salt Range. Mr. Wright, the Collector of Customs, brought to the assistance of Mr. Ouseley, Deputy Commissioner, a very valuable reinforcement in the shape of 100 of the men of the preventive service, who being all armed and natives of the Punjab or else Path\u00e1ns, created a valuable counterpoise to the mutinous company of the 46th Native Infantry, which formed the treasury guard. The transit of the 39th Native Infantry through the district on their way from Jhelum to Dera Ismail Khan caused a panic amongst the people of Shahpur. Strange rumours began to circulate about these men, valuables were buried, people became unsettled, and the Commanding Officer of the regiment feared to come through Shahpur while the company of the 46th was there, expressing a hope that Mr. Ouseley had not much treasure under his care. On the evening of the 22nd May a strong guard of police marched into the treasury with three European officers of the station, and took possession of all the surplus money, amounting to Rs. 2,50,000. Part of this was forthwith sent towards Jhelum and part towards Dera Ismail Khan. Under orders which were subsequently received the Jhelum consignment was recalled; but the move which took it in the first instance from the 46th was a most ably planned one, as the Hindust\u00e1n\u00ed troops were at the same time turned out of the treasury fort, which was garrisoned by the police battalion, fortified and provisioned, and a well sunk to supply drinking water.\n\nAt one time the villages of the B\u00e1r were said to be in an\nunquiet state. Mr. Ouseley posted ten police horse on the confines of the tract of land so called, and as no mutiny of the sepoys took place in the district, the wild tribes remained peaceful even when their brethren in the Mult\u00e1n Division broke out. The mutiny of a portion of the 9th Irregular Cavalry affected this country so far as that it called out the Deputy Commissioner, two or three of the customs officers, and a number of the police. The mutineers were pursued by the police; the soldiery and district officers of five or six districts were on their trail and gave them no rest until Captain Hockin came up with them in the Jhang District and cut them up. A Hindust\u00e1ni clerk in the customs office was detected in an attempt to unite Hind\u00fas and Muhammadans against our Government. He was apprehended, convicted, and punished.\n\nA force of local levies was raised, thus affording vent to the warlike spirit of the martial tribes of the district who chafed at inaction, and probably would have fretted us had not a legitimate object been given them on which to spend their strength. Of these levies upwards of 1,000 horse were raised from among the Tiw\u00e1n\u00e1s alone; and Mr. Ouseley describes his relief at their departure as great.\n\nProbably there is no district in the Punjab the territorial limits and constitution of which have undergone so many changes as that of Shahpur. At annexation, the whole of the Chaj Do\u00e1b, from the boundary of the Jammu territory to the junction of the rivers Jhelum and Chen\u00e1b, was placed under the charge of Mr. E. C. Bayley, and administered by him as one district. But the charge was found too extensive. Accordingly, in June of the same year (1849), this tract of country was divided and formed into the two districts of Gujr\u00e1t and Shahpur; the latter comprising the four k\u00e1rd\u00e1rships of Mi\u00e1ni, Bhera, S\u00e1h\u00edw\u00e1l, and K\u00e1dirpur, to which were added the three lowest zails of the k\u00e1rd\u00e1rship of K\u00e1dirabad, viz., Midh, Ahmadnagar, and K\u00e1low\u00e1l on the Chen\u00e1b. As time wore on, however, and our acquaintance with the newly conquered country became closer, defects were discovered in the first apportionments of territory into circles of administration, and in respect to Shahpur and the surrounding districts speedily led to changes. The first took place in 1851, when the whole tal\u00fasf of K\u00e1dirpur was transferred to Jhang, on the ground that the tal\u00fakas of which it was composed had always been subordinate to that place, that it was more conveniently situated with respect to the head-quarters of that district, and that the inhabitants were chiefly Si\u00e1ls, closely connected with others of the same tribe in Jhang. For somewhat\nsimilar reasons, the taluka of Khush\u00e1b was made over to Shahpur from Leiah, from the commencement of the financial year 1853-54, and the following year saw the transfer back to this district of the Far\u00faka il\u00e1ka.\n\nThe district now consisted of the three tahs\u00edls of Bhera, S\u00e1h\u00edw\u00e1l, and Kalow\u00e1l, of which all but the narrow strip made up of the trans-Jhelum parganas of Khush\u00e1b, Girot, and Jaura, attached to the S\u00e1h\u00edw\u00e1l Tahsil, were situated between that river and the Che\u00e1\u00e1b. Presently, however, further additions were made to the district. Early in the year 1857, as the Chief Commissioner was marching across the Sind-S\u00e1g\u00e1r Do\u00e1b, the leading men of Mitha Tiw\u00e1na came to him in a body praying that the taluka might be transferred to Shahpur; urging as their reason for desiring the change the great distance from the headquarters of their own district (Leiah), and the comparative proximity of Shahpur. The application was favourably entertained, and the transfer took place from the commencement of that financial year. A still more important revision of territorial jurisdictions was made during this year. A difficulty had always been experienced in providing for the effectual administration of that portion of the Sind-S\u00e1g\u00e1r Do\u00e1b which lay within a radius of 50 miles from K\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1gh. Circumstances originally led to the selection of R\u00e1walpindi, Jhelum, and Leiah as sites for stations, and between these places the intervening territory was parcelled out in 1848 as best it might be; but soon it became apparent that they were far too remotely situated to allow of the exercise from them of an efficient control over this tract; and a proposition to create a fourth district having been negatived on the score of expense, the result, as regards this district, was the transfer to it from Jhelum of the following taluk\u00e1s and villages:\n\n| In the Salt Range. | North of ditto. | South of ditto. |\n|-------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| The whole of taluka S\u00e1n | ... ... 19 villages | ... ... |\n| \" \" of \" \" Khabakki | ... ... 6 \" | ... ... |\n| Part of \" \" N\u00farpur Sehti | ... ... 4 \" | ... ... |\n| \" \" of \" \" Jabbi | ... ... 8 \" | ... ... |\n| The whole of \" \" My\u00e1l | ... ... 13 \" | ... ... |\n| Part of \" \" Pakkhar | ... ... 4 \" | ... ... |\n| The whole of \" \" Katha | ... ... 5 \" | ... ... |\n| Part of \" \" Ahmadabad | ... ... 6 \" | ... ... |\n\nin all sixty-five villages, paying a revenue of nearly a lakh of rupees.\nThese extensive additions to the area of the district trans-Jhelum having rendered the creation of a fourth tahsil on that side of the river absolutely necessary, the recently transferred tracts were formed into a new fiscal division, which received the name of the J\u00e1ba Tahsil from the small village of that name in the Salt Range, where the head-quarters were established. From this time the limits of the district remained unaltered till the year 1861, when the revision of establishments led to the absorption of the K\u00e1low\u00e1l Tahsil, and the distribution of its villages between the Bhera and Chin\u00f3it Tahsils; the latter a sub-collectorate of the Jhang District. Important changes were carried out in 1862, when the taluka of N\u00farpur in the Thal was received from Bannu, the Pakkhar taluka, extending from Sakesar to Nikki, was cut off and attached to the Mi\u00e1nw\u00e1li Tahsil of that district, and the remainder of the Jaba Tahsil lying north of the Salt Range was transferred to Jhelum. These interchanges of territory between Shahpur and the surrounding districts necessitated a complete remodelling of the interior fiscal divisions, which was effected by forming the whole of the country still attached to the district trans-Jhelum into one tahsil, the head-quarters being moved to Khush\u00e1b; and by the transfer from the Bhera to the S\u00e1hiw\u00e1l Tahsil of an equivalent for the villages which had been added to the former on the breaking up of the Kalow\u00e1l Tahsil, as described above; at the same time as S\u00e1hiw\u00e1l was now no longer central, the head-quarters of that tahsil were removed to Shahpur.\n\nIn 1877-78 the following villages were transferred from Shahpur to Gujr\u00e1nw\u00e1la District:\n\n(1) Thatta Mull\u00e1h\u00e1nw\u00e1la, (4) Chhani Rahmat Kh\u00e1n,\n(2) Burj Fattu, (5) Chhani M\u00edf Muhammad,\n(3) Chhani Sult\u00e1n, (6) Burj Ghaus,\n\nand in 1880-81 two villages, Burj Rahm\u00e1n and Burj Jaw\u00e1ya, were transferred to Gujr\u00e1nw\u00e1la, to which district they originally belonged, but had been cut off and attached to this in 1877-78.\n\nOn the introduction of irrigation from the Lower Jhelum Canal a new tahsil was created out of portions of Bhera and Shahpur with head-quarters at Sargodha. Between 1904 and 1907, 21 villages in the Kir\u00e1na B\u00e1r were transferred from Jhang District to the Sargodha Tahsil, and settled together with the other portions of this district irrigated from the canal. In 1911 the Bhera Tahsil gave up to Gujr\u00e1t District 77 villages situated to the east of the Lower Jhelum Canal, Main Line and Escape; these villages are all within the area commanded by the Upper\nJhelum Canal; and since it appeared that the best site for a grain-market for this area would be at the Railway junction of Malakw\u00e1l, that village and Nas\u00edrpur were also transferred to Gujr\u00e1t in 1914. In the same year the district head-quarters were transferred from Shahpur to Sargodha, and the transfer of the Eastern Tahsil's head-quarters from Bhera to Bhalw\u00e1l, on the direct line to Kar\u00e1chi, was sanctioned; so clear had it become that the most important interests in the district now centred round the line of rail that conveyed the produce of the canal area to the nearest sea-port.\n\nIn 1907 the demarcation for the first time of a permanent boundary between this district and Gujr\u00e1nw\u00e1la, across the Chen\u00e1b, brought back one of the previously transferred villages to the Bhera Tahsil. In 1906 and 1910 the districts of Mi\u00e1nw\u00e1li and Attock were given a foothold upon the Sakesar Hill, taking over portions of Rakh Sakesar from Khush\u00e1b. In 1912 Shahpur Tahsil gave up one village (Sher Mohammad W\u00e1la) to Bhera and another (Haveli Majoka) to Khush\u00e1b. Maps showing the existing internal and external boundaries of the district are now being prepared, and it is hoped that they will not soon be rendered obsolete by further shufflings.\n\nSome conception of the development of the district since it came into our hands may be gathered from Table No. 1 of Volume B. which gives some of the leading statistics for five-yearly periods, so far as they are available. It is probable that the figures are not always strictly comparable, their basis not being the same in all cases from one period to another. But the figures may be accepted as showing in general terms the nature and extent of the advance made. So far as statistics go, it may be summed up briefly as follows:\u2014In the last 60 years the population of the district has more than doubled; the area under cultivation has quadrupled and the area under irrigation has multiplied more than six-fold; the number of cattle, sheep and goats has more than doubled, while the number of camels is probably much the same as it was; roads have been made throughout the district, and it is now crossed by two railways; prices of agricultural produce have trebled. The land revenue has been raised from about four lakhs to over twenty lakhs, and the value of the proprietary rights in the land, which at annexation was practically nil, is now about 18 crores of rupees.\n\nThe following table shows the Deputy Commissioners who held charge of the district up to 1896 with the period of their\ncharges, omitting periods of less than three months:\n\n| Name                  | Date of assuming charge | Date of relinquishing charge | Total period of charge in years and decimals |\n|-----------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| Major W.

G.) Davies who completed the first regular settlement of the Khush\u00e1b Tahsil, re-organized the whole system of the revenue administration, constructed many of the roads, encouraged the excavation of\ncanals, and improved the towns. Several villages have been named after him, and of all its English rulers he has left the strongest impress on the district.\n\nA list of Deputy Commissioners from 1896 to 1914 will be found in Table No. 33. Mr. (afterwards Sir J. Wilson is remembered (rather as Settlement Officer than as Deputy Commissioner) for the thorough excellence of his revision of the Record of Rights, and the fairness with which he distributed the land revenue demand. Of his successors Mr. French and Major O'Brien are those most frequently mentioned by the villagers as models of what a District Magistrate should be. Messrs. Hailey, Smith, and Rudkin, who at various times were in charge of the adolescent Canal Colony, will long be gratefully remembered.\n\nThe most important events in the history of the district from the economic point of view have been as follows:\n\n- Railway from L\u00e1la M\u00fasa to Malakw\u00e1l opened ... 1886\n- Extended to Mi\u00e1ni and Bhera ... 1887\n- Extended to Khewra Salt Mines ... 1887\n- Extended to Khush\u00e1b ... 1889\n- Extended to Shershah ... 1889\n- Extended from Malakw\u00e1l to Sargodha ... 1903\n- Extended from Sargodha to Shorkot Road ... 1906\n- Maenabbwah Canal excavated ... 1860\n- K\u00e1lra Canal excavated and K\u00e1lra colonized ... 1861\n- Other inundation canals dug ... 1863-1870\n- Lower Jhelum Canal began to irrigate ... 1901\n- Alienation of Land Act came into force ... 1901\n- Gram cultivation in the Thal started ... 1903\n- Co-operative Credit Societies started ... 1909\n\nSection C*.\u2014Population.\n\nTable No. VI gives separate statistics, for each tahs\u00edl and for the whole district, of the total area (cultivated, culturable and cropped), of the total population (urban and rural), of its distribution over area of the inhabited villages classified according to the population they contain and, lastly, of the number of persons per occupied house, which are given separately for towns.\n\n* The remarks in this section are taken principally from the Census Report of 1911 and refer to the statistics of that year.\nand villages.

The same fact may be stated in another way. The population of the six old towns increased from 52,852 in 1891 to 56,426 in 1911, an increase of only 7 per cent. against an increase of 39 per cent. in total population. The gradual growth in the size of villages is shown by the following figures:\n\n| Population | Number of Towns and Villages |\n|------------|-----------------------------|\n|            | In 1881 | In 1891 | In 1901 | In 1911 |\n| Over 10,000 souls | ... | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 |\n| 5,000 to 10,000 | ... | 4 | 7 | 7 | 7 |\n| 3,000 to 5,000 | ... | 9 | 18 | 40 | 52 |\n| 2,000 to 3,000 | ... | 20 | 26 | 40 | 52 |\n| 1,000 to 2,000 | ... | 71 | 85 | 99 | 100 |\n| 500 to 1,000 | ... | 144 | 157 | 150 | 258 |\n| 200 to 500 | ... | 210 | 205 | 496 | 647 |\n| Under 200 | ... | 198 | 212 | 496 | 647 |\n| Total inhabited villages | ... | 657 | 708 | 794 | 1,068 |\n\nThe number of villages of each size has increased considerably, which shows that the increase of population has been pretty evenly distributed over all sizes of villages. The number of inhabited villages and towns has increased from 706 to 1,066* and the average population per town or village has decreased from 699 to 645, which is much above the average for the Province, 595.\n\nIt must be noted, however, that many of these so-called \"villages\" are in reality very large estates or townships, and that their population is often not collected in one \"village\" in the English sense of the term, much of it being found in hamlets situated at some distance from the parent village. This is especially the case with the large estates in the Mohar at the foot of the Salt Range, where the parent village is generally found close to the foot of the hill with several outlying hamlets up on the hill or out on the plain, all within the boundaries of the estate and, therefore, included in\n\n---\n\n* In addition to this number one new estate piece was created for the Shahpur and Khushab Tahsils during the recent settlement, and the Forest Blocks have been renumbered. Seventy-nine estates have been transferred to Gujrat District.\nthe \"village\" for census purposes. Again, in the river valleys it is common for the owners of a well situated some distance from the village to build huts at the well, and practically to live there with their cattle. So that the population is not so closely grouped together as would appear from the high average per village. In the Thal, although the pastoral people wander considerable distances from the village with their cattle, it is not usual for them to establish a fixed residence away from the village, and their homes are, as a rule, closely grouped together into comparatively large villages; there are signs, however, of a centrifugal tendency in this tract also, and it is possible that a system of habitations round scattered wells may before long spring up.\n\nTables 6 and 7 give statistics which show the distribution of the population over houses, in towns and villages. The figures for the last four decades may be compared as follows:\n\n| Number of persons per 100 occupied houses in | 1881 | 1891 | 1901 | 1911 |\n|---------------------------------------------|------|------|------|------|\n| (a) towns                                   | 582  | 515  | 510  | 440  |\n| (b) villages                                | 584  | 550  | 510  | 400  |\n\nSome allowance has to be made for variations in the definition of the word \"house\" by various Census Superintendents; thus in 1881 there were 135, and in 1891 there were 116, families living in every 100 village houses, whereas in 1911 the definition of \"house\" was so framed as to make it almost equivalent to \"family.\" Even so there is a clear tendency towards severalty of interest and separation into smaller family groups. In the villages this may almost certainly be regarded as an indication of increased resources. In the towns the average number of persons per occupied house is now lowest in Bhera (3\u00b769), S\u00e1hiw\u00e1l (3\u00b770) and Mi\u00e1ni (4\u00b707) and highest in Sargodha (4\u00b759), and these figures may be taken partly as an index of the extent to which trade has forsaken those markets which are not on the main lines of communication with Kar\u00e1chi, and partly as a record of plague mortality.\n\nThere is nothing very distinctive about the arrangement of the houses in most of the old towns and villages in this district. The dwellings are clustered together in a thoroughly haphazard manner, and the only principles of town-planning generally recognized are those which relegate the lowest grades of menials to the outskirts of the towns, and group the other non-owners round\nthe homestead of the particular owners under whose patronage (s\u00e1ya) they carry on their trades or labour. Mi\u00e1ni, Bhera, S\u00e1hiw\u00e1l, and Khush\u00e1b were all dignified with city-gates and straight, paved market-streets or squares in the time and under the influence of Captain Davies; and the Shahpur Civil Station was laid out on a pre-conceived plan. In the villages, the courtyards are generally rather spacious, in comparison with the smallness of the buildings and the narrowness of the streets. In the Thal particularly, where all the villages are built on sand-ridges, and there are wide spaces between house and house, there is never any lack of air. But in other respects it may be said in general terms that town-planning is unknown in the older habitations. In the colony, on the other hand, there has been a distinct endeavour to lay out the towns and village sites on lines calculated to facilitate ventilation and cleanliness, and although the earliest colonists were inclined to resist what appeared to them to be grandmotherly interference, the advantages of straight, wide streets have now won a certain amount of recognition throughout the district. In fact, one old village\u2014M\u00e1sar\u2014in Shahpur when attacked by plague, was entirely abandoned by the inhabitants, who built for themselves a new village on approved colony lines.\n\nThe total population of the district and its density per square mile of cultivated area at different periods will be seen from the following table:\n\n| Date of Census | Population | Increase per cent. | Total cultivation in square miles | Density per square mile of cultivation |\n|----------------|------------|--------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n|                |            | Since 1855         | Per annum since previous census |                                      |\n| 1855           | 302,700    |                    |                                  | 476                                    |\n| 1868           | 365,288    | 22                 | 1\u00b77                              | 662                                    |\n| 1881           | 421,508    | 39                 | 1\u00b71                              | 820                                    |\n| 1891           | 493,588    | 63                 | 1\u00b77                              | 1,002                                  |\n| 1901           | 524,259    | 73                 | 1\u00b76                              | 1,187                                  |\n| 1911           | *687,366   | 127                | 3\u00b71                              | 1,930                                  |\n\n*Note.\u2014About 38,400 of this number reside in villages since transferred to Gujr\u00e1t.\n\nCultivation has increased so much more rapidly than population that at each successive census, although the total population\nhas shown a large increase, the density per square mile of cultivation has been less than at the previous census; and when the great development of irrigation from wells, canals and embankments is taken into account, it is clear that the prosperity of the district as measured by the amount of produce per head of population has experienced a great and steady increase. During the last decade, the rapid growth of the Lower Jhelum Canal Colony has eclipsed the advances of the preceding period, though they too were by no means inconsiderable.\n\nThe distribution of the population over the different physical divisions of the district will be seen from the following statement:\n\n| Tract          | Total area | Cultivated area |\n|----------------|------------|-----------------|\n|                | 1891       | 1911            | 1891           | 1911         |\n| Chenab valley  |            |                 | 488            | 357          |\n| B\u00e1r upland     | 55         | 179             | 603            | 275          |\n| Jhelum valley  | 261        | 251             | 555            | 453          |\n| Ara tract      | 93         | 141             | 335            | 231          |\n| Thal desert    | 16         | 23              | 511            | 222          |\n| Mohar          | 70         | 79              | 378            | 344          |\n| Salt Range     | 103        | 128             | 473            | 555          |\n| Total district | 102        | 135             | 498            | 356          |\n\nAt last settlement, the Jhelum and Chenab river valleys supported a far heavier population per square mile of total area than any other part of the district. Now the pressure in these two tracts has been slightly lightened, while there has been a notable increase in the B\u00e1r and Ara tracts, thanks to the Lower Jhelum Canal. The population of the Thal is still extremely sparse.\n\nThe density per square mile of cultivation is highest in the Salt Range, where the healthy climate encourages rapidity of increase in a robust population, and the nature of the countryside precludes large extensions of cultivation. Here the pres-\nsure (555 to the square mile) is considerably higher than the Provincial average (499), and than that of any part of the Punjab except the Himalayan and Sub-Himalayan tracts. In the Jhelum valley, a decrease of population combined with a great increase of cultivation by means of the Lower Jhelum and Inundation Canals has considerably lightened the pressure, which is now only 453 per square mile of cultivation. In the B\u00e1r and Thal pastoral habits have yielded largely to agriculture, and there has been a remarkable alteration in the figures; in the B\u00e1r it is of course the canal, and in the Thal the discovery of gram as a crop, that have made the difference. But pressure is still lightest in the Ara tract, where there has been no incursion of colonists to share in the new canal irrigation.\n\nIn 1897 Mr. Wilson wrote that \"the Shahpur District attracts a smaller proportion of immigrants than do most districts of the Province.\" This is no longer true. In 1911 it was found that out of 637,366 persons enumerated in the district only 542,041\u2014or 78\u00b78 per cent.\u2014were Shalpur\u00eds by birth: the provincial average of intra-district births is over 88. In fact there are only five districts which have attracted more outsiders, and Lyallpur and Lahore alone have gained more from non-contiguous districts. On the other hand, it appears that 35,457 Shalpur\u00eds had emigrated to other parts of India. There must also have been a certain, though small, amount of emigration to other parts of the world. The total gain by migration has therefore been 109,868 souls, less those who have travelled beyond the boundaries of India. Twenty years ago, there was a net loss of 249 souls; in this respect as in so many others, the canal has made all the difference.\n\nOf the 145,325 immigrants 84,147 came from contiguous districts; 52,269 from other districts and states in the province; 6,500 from other parts of India (principally Kashmir, Dera Ismail Khan, Peshawar, Bikaner and Meerut); and 2,325 from other countries in Asia, practically all of these being Pawindas or other seasonal visitants from Afghanistan. Only 84 persons were born outside Asia, and 76 of these were natives of the United Kingdom. The figures in the margin show the districts which did most to supply new blood for the district. There are no less than\n\n---\n\n*These Afghans generally make themselves very unpopular in the villages along their line of march, owing to the damage they do to standing crops. In the localities in which they stop and work, much is forgiven them, for their great utility.*\n141,073 immigrants in the area commanded by the Lower Jhelum Canal.\n\nOf the 35,457 emigrants traceable, 30,966 were enumerated in the Punjab, and 4,491 in the North-West Frontier Province and other parts of India. The six neighbouring districts absorbed 18,847; Lyallpur took 4,489; Lahore 1,629; and Multan 1,367.\n\nTwenty years ago the immigrants were found to consist of 17,414 males and 19,264 females, in spite of the fact that more males than females came from every district except Jhelum, Jhang, Gujrat and Gujranwala. This clearly indicated that much of the migration to and from the contiguous districts was due to the exchange of women in marriage. This exchange still continues; thus we find that these same four districts absorbed 8,883 female emigrants as against 6,664 male. But owing to the large number of colonists who have come in as bachelors or \"grass-widowers,\" there is now no single district which has given Shahpur more women than men; and altogether there have only been 57,825 female immigrants for 87,500 male. For both sexes the canal area has irresistible attractions; it is in the nature of things that where women are a marketable commodity, the best market will be that in which the demand is most in excess of the supply and purses are longest; and even a woman who can choose her own mate will be apt to prefer the ampler life of a tract where holdings are large and rivals comparatively few.\n\nThe balance of emigration is also in favour of the males, but the excess (19,723 male emigrants as against 15,734 female) is insignificant, and is surprisingly small when one remembers that large numbers of Tiwanas, Awans, and Baloches are serving in the army, and that the district has only 82 women for every 100 men. At last settlement there was actually a gain by migration of 1,254 females as against a loss of 1,503 males, so that the tendency at that time was towards levelling up the sexes; now the natural discrepancy is further enhanced by migration. The importance of this fact will be dealt with in a subsequent paragraph.\n\nIt would naturally be expected that the attractions of the colony would draw to the district a supply of new blood of good quality, and the statistics indicate that this has actually happened. The subject is dealt with in some detail in paras. 111-112\nof the Punjab Census Report. The percentage of total immigrants belonging to the more important castes is shewn in the margin. In addition to these Pathans, Baloches, Sayyads, Rajputs, Awans and Khokhars supplied 7.2 per cent. between them, and Arains, Mochis and Gujars each supplied over 1 per cent. The agricultural castes brought with them about 2 females for every 3 males; the artizan and trading castes brought about 4 females for every 5 males. Again, the agriculturists brought 33 children (under 16) and 24 elders (over 40) for every 43 persons in the prime of life; the menials brought more children and fewer elders, and the traders fewer of each. From this it may be predicted that natural reproduction will proceed most rapidly among the menials and least rapidly among the agriculturists; and in a tract where hired labour is necessary but expensive, and commercial development is apt to lag behind agricultural, this is all the better for the farmers. So it seems that the general position as regards the quality of the colonists is satisfactory.\n\nThe distribution of population according to age, sex and civil condition will be found in Table 10, both for the district as a whole, and grouped by religions.\n\nThe discussion of ages is an unprofitable task where the figures are mainly the offspring of guess-work and superstition. Among the more important reasons that make for error are (1) sheer ignorance; (2) desire to claim a certain status, e.g., an unmarried damsel will often, for very shame, declare herself to be too young for matrimony, and will even more often be declared by her lawful guardian to be too young to be excluded from the legal definition of minor; again a youth rather too young for a coveted appointment will overstate his age, while any official in danger of superannuation will understate it; (3) vanity; one grey beard will resort to henna-dye and claim to be in the prime of life, while another will find more dignity in patriarchal longevity; (4) maternal solicitude; a child in robust health will be recorded as older than his real age, in order to avoid the evil-eye; while a weakling will have a year or two knocked off, in order to conceal his backwardness.\n\nAn amusing proof of the extent to which the people have given their ages in round numbers is afforded by the following\nThe reason of this alternation must be that in 1881 and 1901 the age returned was the age last birthday, and in 1891 the age next birthday pushed back a year, so that, for instance a man who said his age was about 50 was shown in 1881 as 50, and is shown in 1891 as 49, and the round numbers have the best of it in the statistics for 1881, and the worst of it in those for 1891. This throws a doubt upon all the age statistics over ten years of age.\n\nAgain the ages of children are open to a good deal of doubt. Here also it seems clear that in 1891 the 6-year olds were placed in the first group, while in 1901 and 1911 they were placed in the second and similarly with the 10-year olds. For Table 11 shews that from 1891 to 1900 the birth-rate was not appreciably lower than it was from 1885 to 1890, and there was no special mortality just before the 1901 Census.\n\nWith these considerations in mind we may compare the existing state of affairs with that which preceded the opening of the canal, and with that of the Province as a whole. There has been a marked rise in the percentage of adults, naturally enough,\nand a corresponding drop in the figures for elders and patriarchs: but it is surprising that, in spite of the influx of unencumbered colonists the proportion of adults in the prime of life is still below the provincial average, and that the number of children is so great. The main reason must be the plague of 1904 and 1907, which took heaviest toll from those in the prime of life: but probably also the increase in resources has encouraged the begetting of children. So the gain in youth and middle age has been entirely at the expense of the old.\n\nIn 1891 there were 456,910 natives of Shahpur still resident in the district; in 1911 there were 542,041, giving a natural increase of 19 per cent. or '95 per cent. per annum. From 1855 to 1891 the annual natural increase was about 1\u00b745 per cent. of the native population of 1855 (which may be taken as approximately 300,000). The set-back which these figures indicate is no doubt due to the occurrence in quick succession of three years so disastrous as 1904, 1907 and 1908.\n\nThe birth and death statistics tell the same tale:\n\n| Period       | Birth | Deaths | Total increase or decrease | Birth rate per 1,000 of total population existing at beginning of period | Death rate per 1,000 of total population existing at beginning of period |\n|--------------|-------|--------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| 1881\u20141890    | 169,401 | 117,846 | +51,555                    | 37                                              | 26                                              |\n| 1891\u20141900    | 195,709 | 157,089 | +38,620                    | 40                                              | 32                                              |\n| 1901\u20141910    | 235,369 | 247,506 | -12,137                    | 45                                              | 47                                              |\n\nIt is of course impossible to reconcile entirely the census returns with the vital statistics derived from birth and death registers. Thus, the total population of the district in 1901 was only 524,259, and according to the vital statistics, the number of Shahpur-born residents ought not to have exceeded 512,122; but the census returns show 542,041. The discrepancy may be partly accounted for by the inclusion in this district of 21 villages in the Kir\u00e1na B\u00e1r during the decade; also it is highly probable that a number of residents who were driven out of the district by the lean years that ushered in the century returned as soon as the canal began to irrigate. Possibly the female births (110,896 as against 124,473 males) have been understated, and in any case it is only to be expected that a registering staff\nof village watchmen should fail to give unimpeachable results. The fact that there has been a steady rise in the rates both of birth and death gives some ground for believing that registration is becoming gradually more universal. Recent statistics appear to indicate that, in the absence of any serious visitation of disease, the normal birth-rate for the district is 45 and the normal death-rate 30 per thousand; this means a natural increase, under favourable conditions, of 1\u00b75 per cent. per year, and this is not likely to lead to overcrowding for many years to come.\n\nUnfortunately during the past decade conditions have often been far from favourable, and wide departures from the normal rate have been common. The average death-rate for the decade ending 1911 is 47\u00b72 per thousand per annum as against 43\u00b76 for the Province. The birth-rate is 44\u00b79 as against 40\u00b78 for the Province. Table 11 shows the details for each year since 1901, together with the actual mortality from fever, plague, small-pox and cholera; table 12 shows the deaths from fever, compared with the deaths from all causes, for each month since January 1901. Two facts emerge clearly:\u2014(a) the death-rate for the year is more affected by an epidemic of plague than by a severe outbreak of fever; even the worst fever year (1908) only shows a death-rate of 53\u00b73, which is far below the rates (97\u00b73 and 90\u00b77) of the two worst plague-years (1904 and 1907); (b) a severe outbreak of fever is more potent than plague to reduce the birth-rate in the succeeding year: the three years in which the fever-mortality was highest (1892, 1908 and 1903) were all followed by years of low birth-rate (30, 43 and 35). But these two factors cannot always be disentangled, and it stands to reason that in a year in which fever or plague is carrying off women in thousands, the birth-rate for that year will be affected. Thus it is hard to say how far the low birth-rate of 1904 was due to the fever of the preceding year, and how far to the plague that broke out during the year. The birth-rate in 1908 (50\u00b75) is surprisingly high, in view of the fact that a large number of young married women must have succumbed to plague in 1907, and many more to fever in the autumn of 1908; it looks as though the women who survived June 1907 enjoyed 14 months of unusual fecundity. Nor is it easy to account for the high birth-rate of 1910 (56\u00b73) or the low rate (39\u00b76) of 1911; fever was distinctly bad in the first half of 1909, while 1910 was comparatively free; in neither year was plague serious and even in 1911 it was hardly sufficient to explain the low birth-rate. Here again one might almost say that the appalling mortality from fever from September 1903 to June 1909 induced greater\nfecundity in the surviving women in the succeeding twelve months, followed naturally by a period of \"fallow\"; it is impossible to suppose that the high birth-rate of 1910 was restricted to those parts of the district which are least subject to fever, for it can be seen from table 13 that the towns of the Jhelum valley also shared in the general rise.\n\nThe effect of good or bad crops upon the birth-rate is rather obscure, and is probably not very considerable, but it is possible that the low rates of 1888 and 1900-01 were due to scarcity; certainly the statistics do not suggest that hard times produce more babies, as is sometimes maintained.\n\nIn the days when plague was unknown, the healthiest months were February, March, April, July and August. May and June were the worst months for cholera, and from September to January, fever was doing its deadly work. The experience of the past 10 years (table 12) shows August and September to be the months in which fewest deaths occur. Fever is most fatal in December and January; it is only slightly less so in November and October, and sometimes June and July show a large number of deaths, which may probably be attributed to the abrupt changes of temperature at the break of the monsoon. In fact there appears to be a general connection between the fever mortality and the mean minimum temperature, especially in the early winter months. In February and March, though nights are cool, deaths from fever are not common; probably those who have survived the coldest months are proof against the milder rigours of the winter's close. April, May, August and September seldom have many deaths from fever, though no doubt the seeds of many fatal attacks are sown in the last-named month. Plague seldom becomes serious until the winter is half over, and it increases in virulence as spring advances, not abating appreciably till June; April and May are far the worst months.\n\nThe district is on the whole comparatively healthy, in spite of the fact that the average death-rate for the ten years ending 1911 was 47 per thousand per annum against 44 per thousand for the Province. The normal mortality, both for the district and for the province, is of course far lower than these figures suggest. For the 18 year period preceding 1904, the district average was 29\u00b75 per thousand. But in 1904 and 1907 the figures were raised by severe visitations of plague to 97\u00b73 and 90\u00b77 respectively, and in 1908, which was an unusually wet year, a severe outbreak of fever caused an abnormally high death-rate (58\u00b73). Plague is a much dreaded invader, and when it is\nremembered that it caused 37,278 deaths in 1904 and 31,433 in 1907 (not to mention the milder onslaughts of 1905, 1911 and 1915), the dread becomes intelligible; but in the long run fever is much the more deadly enemy; year after year it claims at least 8,000 victims, and in 1908 out of 27,922 deaths no less than 21,466 were due to fevers. Like the rest of the Punjab this district suffers severely in the autumn months from intermittent, and to a less extent, from remittent fevers, more especially along the banks of the rivers and in the villages near the foot of the Salt Range. In November and December the fever is often complicated with pneumonia and bronchitis, and dysentery and diarrhoea are common symptoms of the disease. Towards the end of the season, enlargement of the spleen is often prevalent.\n\nThe district is subject also to visitations of cholera, one of which in 1888 attacked 5,918 persons and carried off 3,924, raising the death-rate for the year to 34 per thousand, and another in 1892 attacked 5,830 persons and carried off 3,090. The villages most liable to this much dreaded pestilence are those in the Salt Range and at its foot where the water-supply is limited to a very few springs, ponds, or wells and is easily contaminated. Several of these villages were literally decimated by cholera in less than a month. In the towns greater attention is paid to sanitary measures and especially to the protection of the water-supply, and probably for this reason the ravages of cholera are generally less serious. For the last twenty years there has been no serious outbreak of cholera, though from time to time as many as 300 deaths may occur in the year. In 1912 small-pox carried off 2,164 persons, of whom 1,639 were children. Apart from the chief visitations of plague, the worst year within living memory for the public health was the year 1892 when a cholera visitation in the hot months was followed by heavy rains and high floods, causing an epidemic of fever which attacked at least 80 per cent. of the total population. Owing to this combination of diseases the total death-rate for the district rose for the year to 56 per thousand. For the month of October it was at the rate of 156 per thousand per annum. The town of Bhera lost in the year, chiefly from fever and its sequelae, 1,278 of its 17,428 inhabitants; and the town of Sahiwal 890 of its 9,210 inhabitants: that is, 97 per thousand of its inhabitants died within the year. In 1908 when there was but little plague, Bhera town lost as many as 1,907 inhabitants of whom 1,586 succumbed to fever. The prevalence of fever is perhaps chiefly due to the carelessness of the people in the matter of avoiding chills, but one of its causes is want of good drainage, and endeavours are being made to improve the\ndrainage of the towns of Bhera and Sahiwal which suffered the most.\n\nOn the right bank of the Chenab, especially at Midh, goitre is common, and the very dogs, cows, and even trees are said to suffer from it; it is probably due to the quality of the water in the wells. Guinea-worm is frequently met with in the villages along the foot of the Salt Range, where the inhabitants often use water taken from stagnant ponds, rendered filthy by the cattle which are allowed to wade in them. Stone in the bladder is common throughout the district.\n\nThe measures taken to combat these various diseases are discussed in Chapter III, in connection with the medical administration.\n\nIt will be seen from table 14 that there has been a steady improvement in the amount of affliction by blindness, muteness, insanity, and leprosy, both absolutely and, even more, in relation to the total population, since 1881. Every successive census has shown a marked improvement, and there is no reason for distrusting the figures. It is noticeable that in each class of infirmity more men are afflicted than women; up to 1901, the proportion of blindness was always higher among females. The improvement in the amount of blindness is particularly satisfactory, and must be largely ascribed to the readiness of the peasants to take their eye-troubles to the hospitals\u2014especially to Bhalwal hospital. Those who have shuddered at the swarms of flies clustering round the eyes of children in towns and villages may derive some comfort from the fact that only two children in a thousand grow up to a life of total blindness. On the other hand, the eyesight of boys at the end of their school career is often unsatisfactory.

And out of the 40, more than 22 fail to live a full year (23 in the case of boys, and 22 in the case of girls). Out of every 100 deaths, 38 take off children under five years old, and more than 21 take off infants under one year. We shall see in the next few pages that the greater difficulty of rearing infant boys tends to neutralize a preponderance of male births. It is not till later in life that the effects of neglecting girls begins to tell. But there can be no doubt that a great deal of the waste of life in both sexes could be prevented by cleanliness, care, and recourse to the hospital.\n\n**Birth customs.**\n\nOn the birth of a child in a Muhammadan family the mull\u0101h is sent for, who utters the call to prayer in the child\u2019s ear, and receives a small present. After a week the child\u2019s head is shaved by the nai or barber; the child is then named by the head of the household; food and sweets are distributed, and the barber and other menials are given small presents. The ceremonies are the same in the case of boys and girls, but the rejoicings are greater in the former case. Sometimes a goat is sacrificed but this custom is not general, being confined to well-to-do persons. Circumcision (*sunnat*) can be performed by the barber any time after the child is a week old, but generally when he is 3 or 4 years old.\n\nAmong Sikhs the naming ceremony of boys is as follows:\u2014A month after birth the child is taken to the *dharms\u0101la*, the *Granth S\u0101hib*, or sacred book, is opened at random by the *B\u1e96\u0101\u012b* or some respectable man: and the 1st letter of the 1st verse on the page is the first letter of child\u2019s name. *Kar\u0101\u1e96 parsh\u0101\u1e0f* is then distributed among the audience and the near relations.\nAmong other Hindus of the Sahjdh\u00e1ri sect the custom is similar but the child is often named either by some respectable member of the family or by a Pandit after reference to the teva or janam patri; at any time from 6 months to 5 or 7 years, according to the custom of the family, the head is shaved, and on this occasion the sacred thread janeu) is sometimes put on; this ceremony is a time of rejoicing, and the relations and acquaintances are fed by the parents.\n\nAccording to the different censuses the proportion of males to females has been as follows:\n\n| Year of census | Total District | Tahsil Bhora | Tahsil Shahpur | Tahsil Khush\u00e1b | Tahsil Sargodha |\n|---------------|----------------|--------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|\n| 1855          | 862            |              |                |                |                |\n| 1868          | 889            | 877          | 873            | 914            |                |\n| 1881          | 901            | 862          | 890            | 956            |                |\n| 1891          | 912            | 887          | 905            | 953            |                |\n| 1901          | 919            | 901          | 893            | 969            |                |\n| 1911          | 824            | 783          | 879            | 959            | 689            |\n\nThe gradual rise in the proportion of females from 1855 to 1901, and the sudden drop after that date, are very marked; probably the former was largely a matter of closer enumeration (though we have also seen that the balance of trade in the matter of brides was in favour of this district); the latter is due partly to the effects of plague and partly to the colony. It will be seen that in Tahsil Sargodha, where there was practically no cultivation in the old days, the proportion of females is very low; in Bhera, where there are a number of colony chaks, there has been a marked drop; in Shahpur, the immigrants have mostly been tenants for old established villages; and in Khush\u00e1b, where there is no canal cultivation to speak of, the women are relatively more numerous than they were 20 years ago, and much more so than in any other part of the district. As a matter of fact the real proportion of women to men in Khush\u00e1b is not so high as it looks, as many of the men of that tahsil are always absent, either on military service, or on the \"squares\" of themselves or others.\nEven apart from the effects of plague and migration the women are too few for the men. The natural born population has only 869 females per 1,000 males. This appears to be to some extent due to a majority of male-births, for, however doubtful the registration figures may be, the fact that in every single year since 1891 there has been a majority of males registered must represent a real excess. But here as elsewhere the boys are harder to rear, especially in the first year of life, and probably if the number of children less than one year old at the time of the 1911 census were known, it would be found that the boys and girls were nearly equal: in 1891 there were 11,339 infant boys to 11,360 infant girls, and the census Report for 1911 shews that in the North-West Punjab there were 955 girls for every 1,000 boys. From the second year onwards however the boys have a much better chance of survival; reasons for this are not far to seek. Although there is no reason to suspect female infanticide or systematic neglect of female children there is no doubt that they are less valued than male children and not so well fed in times of scarcity. Boys and men too live a much more healthy out-of-door life than do girls and women, and the dangers of child-bearing are a frequent cause of death, especially in a country where early marriages are common, and where so little medical aid or proper nursing is given to women at child-birth. Yet the steady increase in the proportion of females to males at each successive census up to 1901 may perhaps show that the value of female life is improving. After the years of infancy a girl is by no means without her value in the eyes of her parents. She forms a most useful member of the family while she remains with it, and when she is of marriageable age, if she does not bring in a money price, she can at least be bartered for a bride for one of the sons. After marriage, she generally forms a useful helpmate.\nto her husband, and is valued by him, if for nothing else, at all events for the cost of getting her or of replacing her. The low figure for the ages between 14 and 20 is misleading; as already explained, if a girl is unmarried after puberty, she will almost certainly be returned as adolescent; and if she is married, she will probably put her age as at least 20. But the low rate for the adolescent period must be principally attributed to the plague of 1904, which carried off 104 females per 1,000, as against 90 males. The sudden rise after the age of 20 is only in part accounted for by the self-importance of the young bride; naturally the greater number of the female immigrants would have been young adult women of 20 or over.\n\nThe various factors that have contributed to the existing sex distribution may be disentangled as follows:\n\n| Increase in population between 1891 and 1911 | Males | Females |\n|---------------------------------------------|-------|---------|\n| (a) Natural increase; births from 1891 to 1911 | 227,195 | 203,883 |\n\nLess deaths from 1891 to 1911\n\nNet increase\n\n(b) Gain by immigration: immigrants in 1911\n\nLess immigrants in 1891\n\nNet increase\n\n(c) Gain by return of emigrants from Punjab and North West Frontier: emigrants in 1891.\n\nLess emigrants in 1911\n\nNet increase\n\n(d) Gain by return of emigrants from elsewhere: emigrants in 1891.\n\nLess emigrants in 1911\n\nNet increase\n\n(e) Unaccounted for\nPart of the last item may be assigned to the 21 villages transferred from Jhang to this district between 1901 and 1911, and the rest must be due to faulty registration, especially in the earlier portion of the period; from 1901 to 1911 the corresponding discrepancy for the two sexes together is less than 30,000.\n\nTaking the figures for the different religions the proportions are as follows:\n\n| Religion | Females per Thousand Males | Number of Children per Thousand of Total Population |\n|----------|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n|          |                           | Under five years | Five to nine years |\n|          |                           | Males | Females | Males | Females |\n| Hindu    | 935                       | 800   | 65     | 64    | 70     | 62     |\n| Sikh     | 896                       | 795   | 72     | 67    | 77     | 61     |\n| Musalman | 909                       | 829   | 76     | 72    | 77     | 67     |\n| Christian| 818                       | 771   | 94     | 87    | 82     | 71     |\n\nIt is worth remarking that in 1891 the Hindus had a considerably higher proportion of females than the Musalmans. The difference must be due to the fact that whereas in 1891 practically all the Hindus of the district were resident traders, in 1911 there were a considerable number of Jat colonists, and mercantile pioneers in the new colony towns. Plague too has taken heaviest toll from the town-dwelling females. This would also explain the small proportion of Hindu infants of both sexes. The Christians, again, are nearly all low caste colonists; their high percentage of children can only be attributed to their great fecundity. The Musalman naturally finds it easier than others to get a wife from among the local population, and hence, even though the agricultural colonists brought comparatively few women with them, they have been able to keep up their proportion more successfully. The number of Muhammadan girls is satisfactory. The Sikhs have the smallest proportion of girls to boys, as was also the case at last settlement.\n\nThe fact that in each of the main religions there are more boys and less girls between 5 and 9 years than there are under five years can be explained as follows: we have already seen that children declared as five years old have been recorded in the older\ngroup; and as five is both a lucky age, and a good round number, many four-year olds have certainly been promoted out of the youngest group; so in each sex the youngest group should be enlarged and the elder group reduced. Probably, if a similar allowance be made for nine-year olds, described as ten-year olds, the true figures would be something like this:\n\n| Religion | Under Five Years | Five to Nine Years |\n|----------|-----------------|-------------------|\n|          | Males | Females | Males | Females |\n| Hindu    | ...   | ...     | 70    | 67      | 67    | 61    |\n| Sikh     | ...   | ...     | 77    | 70      | 74    | 60    |\n| Musalm\u00e1n | ...   | ...     | 79    | 75      | 76    | 68    |\n\nFrom this we can see how early neglect tells on the vitality of girls, especially among the Sikhs.\n\nThe figures for conjugal condition are as follows:\n\n| Year | Males | Females |\n|------|-------|---------|\n|      | Single | Married | Widowed | Single | Married | Widowed |\n| 1881 | 581    | 376     | 43      | 442    | 436     | 122    |\n| 1891 | 581    | 375     | 44      | 459    | 427     | 114    |\n| 1901 | 588    | 368     | 44      | 461    | 423     | 116    |\n| 1911 | 572    | 367     | 61      | 444    | 441     | 115    |\n| Provincial average, 1911 | 528 | 388 | 84 | 377 | 480 | 143 |\n\nIt is clear that compared with the Province as a whole this district has a large number of bachelors and spinsters; even in the North-West Punjab the average proportion is 571 bachelors and 439 spinsters.\nThe figures for the different religions are as follows:\n\n| Conjugal condition | Proportion per thousand of all conditions |\n|--------------------|------------------------------------------|\n|                    | Males | Females |\n|                    | Single | Married | Widowed | Single | Married | Widowed |\n| Hindu              |        |         |         |        |         |         |\n|                   | 1891   | 559     | 395     | 46     | 288     | 459     | 158     |\n|                   | 1911   | 548     | 387     | 65     | 387     | 449     | 164     |\n| Sikh               |        |         |         |        |         |         |\n|                   | 1891   | 522     | 432     | 46     | 376     | 498     | 126     |\n|                   | 1911   | 560     | 370     | 70     | 397     | 468     | 135     |\n| Musalman           |        |         |         |        |         |         |\n|                   | 1891   | 586     | 370     | 44     | 472     | 421     | 107     |\n|                   | 1911   | 575     | 367     | 58     | 454     | 438     | 108     |\n\nAll religions have a higher proportion of widows and widowers; but the increase among Muhammadan widows is slight, while among Hindus it is great. Plague has hit the towns harder than the villages, and even in the towns the Muhammadan widows of eligible age remarry. There are fewer bachelors than formerly among the Hindus and Muhammadans, which is at first sight surprising: probably the explanation is that the high death rates of the past decade have reduced the numbers of male infants out of proportion to the total male population. The increase of bachelors among the Sikhs is clearly due to the migration of young men from the Central Punjab. It is rather surprising to find so many spinsters among the Sikhs, but they have considerably raised their marriage age. There are fewer Muhammadan spinsters than heretofore, thanks to the shortage of wives: even the most ill-favoured damsel is now sure of a husband.\n\nJudged by the figures, the age of marriage is rising for both sexes throughout the community. And this is actually the case so far as Hindus and Sikhs are concerned, and also for Muhammadan\nmales. Whether it is equally true for Muhammadan girls is less certain. On the one hand it is true that the father of a presentable girl is inclined to bide his time and look about for a really good match; but, on the other hand, human nature has not altered much in twenty years, and it is certain that less than 467 out of every thousand young women between 15 and 20 years of age are sexually undeveloped: we shall have occasion to notice in more than one subsequent paragraph the tendency of love-lorn maidens to break loose, and there is a strong feeling amongst the Awan at any rate that girls are best mated while still manageable.\n\nMoreover it is obvious that the shortage of wives must tend to lower the age of marriage. Hence it seems probable that much of the difference between the 378 grown-up virgins of 1891 and the 469 grown-up virgins of 1911 must be put down to differences of classification. We have seen that a young bride will generally declare her age as 20; and we have seen that in 1911 persons declared at 20 were included in the period aged 20\u201324, whereas in 1891 they were included in the period aged 15\u201319. Anyhow it is clear that at present about 4 per cent. of the boys and 20 per cent. of the girls marry before they are 15 years old in the Hindu and Sikh communities, while more than 80 per cent. of their young women, and less than 20 per cent. of their youths under 20 years are married: and among the Musulm\u00e1n only 2 per cent. of boys and 9 per cent. of girls marry before they are 15, and about 14 per cent. of youths and may be 60 per cent. of the young women of under 20 are married. And these figures are decidedly creditable for a backward district.\n\nSooner or later practically everybody finds a spouse. Of men over 40 only 62 and of women over 40 only 11 per thousand remain unwed. The proportion among Hindus and Sikhs is somewhat higher than that among Muhammadans, but they include some celibate orders.\nIt is curious to find in a district where the bulk of the population is allowed to have four wives, and where moreover there are many householders absent on military duty, that there are only 136,912 married women for 138,469 married men. The explanation is that a number of colonists had not in 1911 brought their wives to their new homes, and the Path\u00e1ns from Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n had only about 400 women for 1,900 men. As a matter of fact very few in this district marry more than one wife, except when it is expedient to make a levirate marriage. Apart from the question of expense, it is recognized that a plurality of wives is a source of constant trouble.\n\nOut of the wedded women, nearly 20 per cent. are widows (Hindus 27, Sikhs 22, Muhammadans 19\u00b775) But of the Muhammadan widows only 19 per cent. are under 40, as against 29 and 28 per cent. respectively among Hindus and Sikhs. Among the Muhammadans widow-remarriage is the rule, the brother of the deceased having a more or less recognized right to inherit a soulless widow. This right gives rise to a certain amount of trouble, as many widows much prefer to remain \"widows indeed\", and give their favourite sons-in-law the advantage of cultivating their land, while others refuse to espouse openly either brother-in-law or the man of their choice, but keep up a clandestine intimacy with the latter, while retaining their widow's title in the land.\n\nPolyandry, mother-kin, and female infanticide are all unknown in this district.\n\nThe age at which betrothal takes place depends chiefly on the means of the family; it is not unusual to betroth children at a very early age (two or three years), especially when the betrothed parties are first cousins or otherwise nearly related; but the most common age is among Mussalmans from ten to fifteen, and among Hindus from eight to twelve. It is thought a disgrace to allow a girl to grow up unmarried, and most girls are betrothed before the age of sixteen. Before the formal betrothal (mangewa) takes place, it is usual for the boy's father or some respected friend to go to the girl's father and get his consent. Then the boy's father or near relations go formally to the girl's house taking with them the family barber (nai) and bard (mir\u00e1si) and the following articles, viz., a suit of clothes for the girl (chola, lungi and phulkari), a pair of shoes, a plain silver ring (chhalla), value Re. 1\u00b74\u00b70, some coloured thread (mauli), 5 rupees in cash, 5 seers of gur, and 5 paos of mehdi which are given to the girl's father. A formal blessing (dua khair) is prayed for on\nthe betrothal and sometimes repeated three times. It is not usual to write out a contract of betrothal. Among some of the Musalm\u00e1n tribes, a Brahman accompanies the bard and barber. Others do without any formal ceremony at all, except that of asking a blessing on the betrothal before the assembled relatives. Among Hind\u00fas the boy\u2019s father sends his family Brahman to the girl\u2019s father to fix a date for the betrothal, and on the date fixed the boy\u2019s relatives go to the girl\u2019s house where they are sometimes given by the girl\u2019s father a rupee and some sugar (vaddh\u00e1i).\n\nThe following description of a well-to-do Aw\u00e1n\u2019s marriage will give some idea of the ceremonies common on such occasions. When the cloth is cut for the trousseau (palla) the bridegroom\u2019s father sends the bride\u2019s father Rs. 5 and gives 3 seers of gur to the menials and 3 seers of flour and a seer of gur to the tailor. Each day thereafter the women sing songs at the bridegroom\u2019s house. A few days before the wedding, the bride\u2019s father receives the kap, i.e., the bridegroom\u2019s female relatives with song and music take him Rs. 25, 3 maunds of wheat, 5 sheep, 10 seers of ghi and 15 seers of gur to help towards the wedding feast, or some smaller contribution if they are in humble circumstances. On the wedding day all the women of the family fetch a jar (gharoti) of water with song and music, and seating the bridegroom on a stool, cover him with a sheet and proceed to bathe him. They throw small coins to the value of a rupee or two into a vessel of milk and then pour the milk over his head, the barber and bard sharing the coins. The bridegroom\u2019s sister or niece seizes his sheet and refuses to let go till he gives her a present. On getting off his seat the bridegroom crushes with his right foot the earthenware lid of a jar (chh\u00fani) and sits down on a blanket. An unmarried youth is appointed his \u201cbest man\u201d (sab\u00e1hl\u00e1) and is given an iron weapon with which he protects the bridegroom. The friends then present their subscriptions towards the wedding (nendar) which are tested by a goldsmith and written down by a Hindu, both of them being rewarded with a rupee for their services. The wedding procession (janj) is then formed and proceeds from the bridegroom\u2019s house to the bride\u2019s where it is received by the women with songs of derision and abuse. A sweeper (ch\u00fahra) shuts the door against them and refuses to open till bribed with a rupee or two (hura). The wedding party then go inside and are feasted, the bridegroom first, and he is expected to give Rs. 5 or Rs. 10 to the bride\u2019s bard and barber who bring him the good things. Then the bride\u2019s female relatives come out and take the bridegroom and his party inside. There they play a game called beri ghori, in which the\nwomen make fun of the bridegroom. The menials attached to\nthe bride's family demand their perquisites from the bridegroom's\nfather. Then the nik\u0101h ceremony is performed according to the\nMuhammadan law, and this generally takes place in the early\nmorning. The reader of the nik\u0101h is given a rupee and the\nrelatives regaled on sesamum and sugar. The bride's father then\nmakes a display of the articles given by him in dower (d\u0101j) to\nhis daughter, and a bard-musician (mir\u0101si) describes them in a\nloud voice (hok\u0101na). The bridegroom, clad in fine clothes goes\nto pay his respects to his mother-in-law, and gives her Rs. 5,\nwhile she gives him a gold ring. The bride's clothes are formally\nchanged, the studs (bunde) are taken out of her ears, and ear-\nrings (v\u0101li) are put in and the front plaits (chond) of her hair,\nwhich mark the virgin, are unplaited and her hair put up in the\nrolls which mark the married woman. This ceremony, called\nkapre vatt\u0101une, is the public sign of the marriage ceremony\nhaving been completed. The wedding procession, now including\nthe bride, returns to the bridegroom's house, where she seizes hold\nof the door and will not go in till her mother-in-law gives her a\ncow or buffalo. A small child is then placed in her lap, and she\ngives it some sugar. She stays there for seven days (satt hore)\nand then returns to her parents' house, where she remains till she\nreaches the age of puberty, when again her husband goes in pro-\ncession (behda) to fetch her home for good.\n\nAmong other Musalm\u00e1n tribes the marriage customs are\nmuch the same, though of course the sums expended vary with\nthe means of the parties. They are usually very extravagant and\noften a marriage plunges the bridegroom's father into hopeless\ndebt. In 1895, an endeavour was made to reduce the expenditure\non marriage ceremonies, and representatives of all classes bound\nthemselves to keep within certain limits in the expenditure they\nwould incur. Among the customs they agreed to discourage\nwere those of feasting all and sundry, employing mir\u00e1sins to\nsing and prostitutes to dance, having fireworks, throwing money\nbroadcast over the bride's palanquin (sot), and distributing\nlargesse to the poor (v\u0101ra).\n\nNo great economy was effected, however, and on the\nwhole the standard of extravagance tends to rise.\n\nThere is no doubt that the expense of finding a suitable bride\nis increasing, and although the peasants hardly confess to the\ncustom of paying \"bride-price,\" they cannot deny that any man\nwith a marriageable daughter will decline to dispose of her in\nmarriage until he has received at least Rs. 120 in hard cash, or\nher equivalent in kind.\nA large number of law suits, civil and criminal, practically turn on the question whether the mother or the uncle of a fatherless girl is entitled to the profits of mating her. It also seems highly probable that much of the trouble arising out of elopements by unmarried or newly-wed damsels arises out of the importance assigned by father and daughter respectively to full coffers and good looks. If the men of the district would combine to discountenance the payment of bride-price\u2014a practice which they affect to contemn\u2014the gain in domestic stability would be enormous.\n\nMeanwhile women, sold into the absolute power of husbands chosen without reference to their tastes, seldom develop a very acute sense of connubial responsibility: in fact, a cynic might maintain that infidelity varied directly as opportunity. The results are only too apparent in the criminal and civil courts. Sometimes the provision of a substitute (vanni) will satisfy the husband or fianc\u00e9 for loss of his bride, or the guardian for loss of his bride-price; but much more often the parties go to law. Perhaps the heroine will lead off with a petition to have her lawful guardian bound over to keep the peace, or imprisoned for having constrained her to marry against her will. The guardian, whether husband or father, will counter-attack with a criminal suit against the gallant for abduction, adultery, or kidnapping, and a civil suit for recovery of the heroine\u2019s jewelry. In each case, all and sundry on both sides are inculpated as abettors. If, as generally happens, the verdict is in favour of accused or defendant, the parties will proceed to take the law into their own hands, and the ensuing riots, murders, grievous hurts and what-not again engage the attention of the magistrate. If at any stage of the proceedings the gallant is imprisoned, the heroine will probably go back to her lawful husband or guardian, relying on her woman\u2019s wit to live down the scandal; but if she decides that the man chosen for her is altogether too distasteful, she will continue to make life a burden for him with suits for dower or maintenance, or by depriving him of his conjugal rights, so long as she can rely on the support of one of her own relations, or those of her lover. In any case she has little to lose, and has the satisfaction of knowing that her escapades have endangered the liberty of several men, and wasted the time of numerous officials, without risk to herself. And it must be admitted that there is a certain wild justice in this queer state of affairs; for it is the fault of the men that she is treated as a cow, and the misfortune of Government that the traffic in brides can be neither stopped nor legalized: if it could be stopped, a woman could be dealt with as a responsible human being, and imprisoned; and if it were lega-\nlized, she could be treated as an irresponsible, and occasionally errant animal, and impounded.\n\nA detailed account of the tribal custom in this district will be found in a separate volume.*\n\nIts general character is as follows:\n\nAmong Hind\u00fas a man may not marry a woman of his own clan, so that he cannot marry an agnate of his own, and as conversely a woman must marry a non-agnate of her father, and the children invariably belong to the tribe and clan of their father, not of their mother (just as in Europe a child takes its father's surname and not its mother's), it follows that any relation through a female, of a man, whether through his mother, sister or daughter must belong to a different group of agnates, i.e., to a different clan. Among the Musalm\u00e1n tribes of the east of the Province, the same rule prevails in practice, although in theory a marriage with an agnate's daughter would be legal, so that in those tribes also all relations through females of a man are necessarily his non-agnates. Among all the Musalm\u00e1n tribes of Shahpur however, Muhammadan Law has had such a strong effect as regards the question of intermarriages of relations that it has entirely abrogated the rule forbidding intermarriage of agnates, and such intermarriages are everywhere very common; indeed it is thought preferable that a man should marry his cousin, whether she be related to him on his father's or his mother's side, rather than that he should seek a wife outside the family, the reason for this preference probably being that a marriage within the family is less expensive and difficult to arrange than a marriage with an outsider, and tends to keep the property within the group of relations. The effect of this breaking down of the old rule has been that, as a man's sister's son or daughter's son may be also his agnatic relation, for instance if his sister have married his father's brother's son, or his daughter have married his brother's son, alienation of the property to a sister's son or daughter's son does not necessarily mean alienation to a non-agnate, and the power of the agnates to forbid such an alienation,\u2014based as it is on the old rule which still holds among Hindu and other exogamous tribes that \"the land must not leave the got, or group of near agnates\"\u2014has been very much weakened, and alienations to such relations through females are much more common than they are in the east of the Province. Indeed the power of the agnates to forbid alienation having been thus weakened, it is among some tribes, such as the Aw\u00e1ns, no longer strong enough to prevent alienation to a sister's son or daughter's son, though he be not himself an agnate, and can hardly prevent alienation even to a non-relative by a sonless man.\n\nGenerally speaking, marriage is a contract, not between the persons to be married, but between their families, and is arranged for them by their agnates with the consent of the mothers, usually while the parties themselves are too young to give an intelligent consent. When the contract has been privately agreed on between the families, the betrothal is completed with elaborate ceremonies of the nature of a sale, in which money plays a principal part. A girl is looked upon as a valuable piece of property, and betrothal is a contract by which the girl's family bind themselves, often for a money\n\n* The Riw\u00e1j-i-\u00e1m of the Shahpur District, compiled by Mr. Wilson. It has been decided by the Financial Commissioner that this is sufficiently up to date for all practical purposes.\nconsideration, or in exchange for another betrothal, to transfer the ownership of the girl to the boy's family on her reaching a marriageable age. If either of the parties die before the marriage actually takes place, the contract is at an end, and the boy's family are not, as in Sirsa, considered entitled to claim that the girl should be married to another boy of their family, if her original betrothed should die. The ceremony of marriage actually transfers the ownership of the girl from her agnates to those of the boy. It is accompanied by many elaborate ceremonies, the binding form being among Musalmans the nikah made according to the Muhammadan Law, and among Hindus, the circumambulation of the sacred fire under the auspices of the family Brahmans. After the marriage the girl remains in her father's house, and actual possession of her is not delivered until she reaches puberty.\n\nWhile such is the usual course of betrothal and marriage, it is much more common in Shahpur than it is in the east of the Province, for betrothal and marriage to be deferred until the parties are grown up, and unmarried women of full age are much more numerous in Shahpur than they are further east. One consequence of this is that the consent of the parties themselves becomes much more important, and it is not uncommon for a grown-up girl to refuse to marry the man selected for her by her parents and guardians and to elope with the man of her choice. Such conduct is bitterly resented, not only by the family of the man she has rejected, but by her own family, and often leads to quarrels and litigation, and although the Musalmans cannot deny that such a marriage is valid by Muhammadan Law, many of them would welcome legislation to make the marriage of a woman without the consent of her parents or guardians, especially to a man of an inferior tribe, void altogether. There is also a general feeling that while a girl's family, who incur no expenses in making the betrothal, have no claim to compensation if the betrothal be broken off, the boy's family, who have to go to some expense to carry out the betrothal, have a claim, not only to a return of their expenses, but to damages for the breach of contract; and that the claim for compensation should lie, not only against the girl's family, but against the family of the man she has married.\n\nAlthough a Musalman may marry four wives, all alive at one time and a Hindu as many as he pleases, it is not very usual for a man to have more than one wife at a time; and where he does marry a second wife during the lifetime of the first, it is generally because the first has not borne him a son, or because of some serious quarrel with her; or when he marries the widow of a deceased brother.\n\nDivorce is very rare, and although a dower is always mentioned at a marriage of Musalmans, it is rarely paid, it being usual for a wife to relinquish her right to dower to her husband on his death-bed.\n\nOrdinarily the whole family remains living in common until the father's death, and his wife, children and sons' wives and children are under his control, as well as the whole of the joint property. As the daughters grow up, they are married into other families, and leave their father's control for that of their husbands' fathers. As the sons grow up, wives are found for them who join the father's family and come under his control. Often the father gives a married son a separate house with a share of the moveables and\nsometimes a separate plot of land; but this is a matter for the father's own decision, and such a partition, unless approximately fair and intended to be final, is liable to be cancelled on the father's death. When that occurs, the whole of the father's estate devolves on the sons, who sometimes continue to live as a joint family, but more often make a division among them of the moveable property and dwelling-houses, and either then or afterwards, of the land also. All the sons take equal shares without regard to age and without regard to the number of tribe of the mothers. The custom of dividing the property among the sons according to the number of mothers, which is not uncommon in the east of the Province, is practically unknown in Shahpur. If one of the sons have died before his father, his sons or widow take his share of the estate by representation. In the presence of sons or son's sons, daughters get no share of the property; they are maintained by their brothers until suitably married into another family.\n\nWhere there are sons, their widowed mother gets no share of the estate but is maintained by her sons; and if they divide the joint estate among themselves, they usually set apart a portion for their mother's maintenance during her lifetime. Where there are no sons, or son's sons, the whole of the estate devolves on the widow, two or more sonless widows taking equal shares. The widow holds the whole estate till her death or re-marriage, and has power to make all ordinary arrangements for its management and to enjoy the whole of its produce. Generally she can do as she pleases with the moveable property, but must not alienate the immoveable property without the consent of the husband's agnates. If, however, the agnates do not make proper arrangements for necessary expenses, the widow can alienate so much of the husband's immoveable property as is absolutely necessary, even without their consent. The widow of an agnate who has died without sons or son's sons, is in all cases entitled thus to succeed to her husband's share, even although, owing to his father being still alive, it had not yet come into his separate possession, or although he was living associated with his brothers (except among the Hind\u00fas where in that case the widow is entitled to maintenance only). When a widow in possession of her deceased husband's estate dies or re-marries, even though she marry her deceased husband's brother, the whole of her former husband's estate, moveable and immoveable, reverts to her husband's agnates, who take it in the shares in which they would have taken it had he died without leaving a widow. A widow having minor sons has much the same power over the estate as has a sonless widow until her sons are old enough to manage it for themselves; but if she re-marry, she loses not only her control over her former husband's estate, but also the guardianship of his children. If she does take them with her to her new home they cannot succeed to any share in the estate of their step-father; they still belong to the family of their own father and (if sons) are entitled to succeed to their father's estate.\n\nWhen a man dies without agnatic descendants or widow, the married daughters or their sons in no case succeed to a share in the estate; but it is the almost universal custom in this district (unlike Gurgaon and Sirsa) that the unmarried daughters succeed in equal shares to the whole of their father's property, moveable and immoveable, till their death or marriage, when it reverts to the agnatic heirs, the powers of the daughters over the estate being similar to those of the widow. Failing unmarried daughters the father of the deceased takes the estate; if the father be also dead it goes to the brothers\nin equal shares. Ordinarily all the brothers, whether of the same mother or not, succeed equally, but if the property had been divided there is a tendency among Musalmans for the full brothers to exclude the half-brothers, and among Hind\u00fas an associated brother excludes an unassociated brother. If one of the brothers has died, his sons or sonless widow take his share of estate by representation. If there be no agnatic descendants of the deceased's father, his mother takes a life-interest in the estate; failing the mother, or on her death, the unmarried sisters take the whole estate till their death or marriage, then the father's brothers and their agnatic descendants take it in shares proportioned to the number of brothers; and so on, the nearest agnates and their agnatic descendants taking the estate in preference to the more remote. Where there are two of a class, they share equally, and the right of representation prevails to the fullest extent. No heir excludes the agnatic descendant or the sonless widow of another heir of the same class. Only agnates and the sonless widows of agnates, and (till their death or marriage) the daughters of agnates, inherit. A married daughter, or sister, or a daughter's or sister's son, can in no case inherit. When the estate goes to a female, she has a life-interest only, and on her death or marriage it reverts to the agnates.\n\nThere is no general custom of considering part of the joint estate as being the special property of the women. Whatever is given with, or to, a woman becomes merged in the joint estate under the control of the agnates, although they should not alienate any such property without the woman's consent unless in case of necessity.\n\nWills are almost entirely unknown*. If a proprietor wishes to interfere with the devolution of his property according to the ordinary rules of inheritance, he must carry out his intentions in his lifetime. An expression of his wishes as to the disposition of his property, if not carried out in his lifetime, has no force after his death.\n\nAmong the Hind\u00fas a man having no son or son's son may adopt any near relation he pleases, even a daughter's son or sister's son, but not a distant relation or stranger, and the person adopted succeeds to the whole of his estate, as if he were a natural son, to the exclusion of the other natural heirs. Among Musalmans, adoption is practically unknown except among the Aw\u00e1ns, where a man having no son or son's son may adopt any Aw\u00e1n he pleases and make him heir to his whole estate; but the adoption must be made by written deed, and is more of the nature of gift than adoption.\n\nThe power of an owner to alienate by gift his moveable property is practically unrestricted, unless when he has sons or sons' sons, in which case he ought not to give away an unreasonably large portion of the moveables so as to injure the sons. A proprietor having sons or sons' sons has no power to alienate by gift without their consent any portion of the immoveable property, except that he can give a small portion of it in dowry to a daughter, or for charitable or religious purposes; and he cannot give a large share of the immoveable property to one son than to another. But a proprietor having no sons or sons' sons is, among the Aw\u00e1ns, almost absolute owner of his whole estate, and can gift it to any relative without the consent of the\n\n*They are, however, now produced occasionally, but no recognised custom in respect of them can be said to have emerged, other than that given.\u2014M. Leigh.\nothers; among other tribes he cannot make a gift of immoveable property to one relative without the consent of the agnate heirs, except sometimes a small portion to a daughter or daughter's son, or son-in-law.\n\nBriefly, it may be said that the influence of the Muhammadan law on the custom of Musalm\u00e1n tribes is confined to questions relating to marriage and divorce, and does not extend to questions relating to property. Among all Musalm\u00e1n tribes a marriage must take place by nik\u00e1h, and any marriage which is legal according to Muhammadan law is allowed to be valid, and although the rules regarding dower and divorce are rarely acted on, they are admitted to be binding on all Musalm\u00e1ns. But the elaborate rules of the Muhammadan Law regarding inheritance, wills and legacies are never acted on, the custom in such matters being founded on the entirely different basis of agnatic relationship. For instance a daughter gets no share in the presence of sons, a sister no share in the presence of brothers, a widow either gets the whole estate or none at all, and the right of representation prevails to the fullest extent. To introduce the elaborate rules of Muhammadan law in those matters would revolutionize the tribal custom of all the Shahpur tribes and give rise to endless injustice and discontent. The only effect of Muhammadan law on questions relating to property has been the indirect influence already mentioned, viz., that by breaking down the rule requiring a woman to be married to a non-agnate, it has weakened the power of the agnates to forbid an alienation of immoveable property to a relation through a female.\n\nAccording to Table No. X of the Punjab Census Report, the linguistic distribution of the district is as follows:\n\n| Total population | 687,366 |\n|------------------|---------|\n| Asiatic Languages | 687,178 |\n| European Languages | 188 |\n| I.\u2014Non Indian | 49 |\n| (a) Persian (49) | |\n| II.\u2014Indian | 687,129 |\n| I.\u2014English | 187 |\n| II.\u2014German | 1 |\n\nDetail of 687,129 Indian-Vernacular-speaking persons.\n\n| Punjabi vernacular | 687,011 |\n|--------------------|---------|\n| Other vernaculars | 118 |\n| (a) Punjabi { Standard ... 658,439 } | 658,712 |\n| (b) Dogri | 273 |\n| (a) Kashmiri | 78 |\n| (b) Lahnda | 20,208 |\n| (b) Sindhi | 21 |\n| (c) Western { Hindustani ... 1,784 } | 4,632 |\n| (c) Gujrati | 6 |\n| (d) Hindi { Urdu ... 1,383 } | |\n| (d) Bengali | 3 |\n| (e) Other Hindi ... 1,466 | |\n| (e) Others | 10 |\n| (d) Pashtu | 2,914 |\n| (e) Rajasthani | 445 |\n| (f) Western Pahari | 99 |\n| (g) Baloch | 1 |\n\nAs between standard Punjabi and Lahnda these figures are practically meaningless. According to the value given to the term Lahnda, both by Sir George Grierson and by Pandit Hari Kishan\nKaul, the whole district (apart from its immigrants), speaks some form of that tongue. In the cis-Jhelum tract, the dialect is called Do\u00e1bi by Sir George Grierson, and the Pandit breaks it up into Bhirochi, Sh\u00e1hpuri, and Jangli. Across the Jhelum are the Thali and the Aw\u00e1nkari. Of these variations, Aw\u00e1nkari falls into the Pandit's north-western group, the Thali into the South-Western, and the others into the South-Eastern, and the further one goes from the centre of the district, the greater will be found the influence of Pothw\u00e1ri, Multani, or standard Punj\u00e1b\u00ed according as one goes north, southwest, or south-east. All these groups have the future in s, the passive in i, make frequent use of pronominal suffixes, and have such forms as assi (we), itthe (here), which are characteristic of Punj\u00e1b\u00ed generally; but while the dialects of the plains have the genitive postposition in da, the dative in nu and the present participle ending in da, the corresponding terminations in the Salt Range dialect are na, ah, and na, and there are many other marked differences which cannot be detailed here. The dialects throughout the district, however, shade off imperceptibly into one another, and every resident of the district is, so far as dialect goes, easily intelligible to every other. Although the district boundary approaches near the Indus and there are a few villages of Path\u00e1ns in the north-west corner, Pashtu is nowhere the mother tongue of the people: those who speak it are all immigrants. The best guide to the language is Sir James Wilson's Manual,* but Bomford's Grammar, Juke's Dictionary, and O'Brien's Mult\u00e1ni Glossary will also be found helpful.\n\nIt is unfortunate that the figures give no sort of indication how far the speech of the Central Punjab has been introduced by colonists, and it is to be hoped that at the next census some clear distinction will be made between (e.g.) the dialects of the Si\u00e1lkoti villages and those of Aw\u00e1n horse-breeders. The speakers of Hindi include officials and other well-educated persons, especially members of the learned professions, as well as grooms, gardeners and domestic servants. The speakers of Rajasth\u00e1ni are labourers from the south. The English language has 187 exponents now as against 53 in 1891 and 27 in 1881: the growth of Sargodha is mainly responsible. It may be confidently predicted that not even 1 individual will confess to German in 1921. Persian is the only language spoken by more women than men.\n\n* \"Grammar and Dictionary of Western Punjabi as spoken in the Shahpur District, with proverbs, sayings, and riddles\" \u2014 J. Wilson, I.C.S., 1898; Punjab Government Press: Rs. 2-8-0.\nTable No. 15 gives the figures for the principal castes and tribes of the district. As regards the landowning tribes statements showing the number of estates and the areas owned by each will be found in the assessment reports. Their general distribution may be broadly described as follows:\u2014In the Chenab valley the land is chiefly owned by the R\u00e1njh\u00e1s, alongside whom are found a few villages of Path\u00e1ns, Rih\u00e1ns, and Nissuwanas. The Gondals are the dominant tribe of the Bhera B\u00e1r\u00e1, and own also a number of estates on either side of it in the valleys of the Chen\u00e1b and Jhelum. West of them in the Jhelum valley come the Bhatt\u00eds and the Khokhars, the latter of whom occupy much of the land on both sides of the river from Bhera down to the Jhang border, interspersed with cognate tribes, such as the Mekans and Jhammats and with other tribes such as the Biloches and Sayads. In the Thal country the dominant tribe are the Tiw\u00e1ns, north of whom along the Salt Range and within its valleys almost the whole area is owned by the Aw\u00e1ns, a very compact tribe. The colonists are roughly arranged with the Si\u00e1lkot\u00eds to the west, the Gujr\u00e1t\u00eds and men from Jhelum to the east, and those from Gujr\u00e1nw\u00e1la in the middle; the colonists from other parts of Shahpur are scattered about among all circles.\n\nAmong the Hind\u00fas, ideas of caste, though they do exist to a certain extent, are not nearly so prominent and have not nearly so great an influence on their daily life as they have among the Hind\u00fas of the east of the Province, while among the Musalm\u00e1ns, although strong social feelings and prejudices exist, they are not of a religious character, and have not to do with semi-religious ideas of purity and impurity, all Musalm\u00e1ns being considered equal before God; so that it may be said that caste, as a religious institution, does not exist among the Musalm\u00e1ns. Nor are ideas as to difference of caste from a social point of view so powerful in the Shahpur District as they are among the Musalm\u00e1ns of the east of the Province, who have been prevented from forgetting their own original caste prejudices by the proximity of larger bodies of Hindus of all castes, in many cases belonging to tribes whose blood-relation with themselves is still remembered.\n\nThe population generally is, however, clearly subdivided into tribes (kaum or z\u00e1t) having a common name and generally supposed to be descended from a traditional common ancestor by agnatic descent, i.e., through males only. Some of these tribes are very homogeneous, as, for instance, the Aw\u00e1ns, who number 65,928, or 9\u00b75 per cent. of the total population. Others\nagain, such as the Khokhars, who are returned as numbering 21,858 or 3 per cent. of the population, are rather a loose congeries of clans than a compact tribe. The tribal division is of some importance in questions of marriage and alienation of property, for although among Musalm\u00e1ns any marriage which is legal according to Muhammadan law is held valid, it is customary to marry only within the tribe or with certain other tribes who are considered to be closely allied, and alienation to a non-agnate is much more readily allowed if he be a member of the tribe than if he belong to another tribe.\n\nAlmost every tribe is again sub-divided into clans (muhi) Clan. or smaller groups of agnates, distinctly recognized as descended through males only from a somewhat remote common ancestor, and usually bearing a common name, exactly similar to the clan-name of a Scottish clan and used very much in the same way. For instance, just as Donald, the son of Duncan, of the clan Campbell, would, in a village in which there were many Campbells, be generally known as \"Donald, the son of Duncan,\" but when he went elsewhere, would be described as \"Donald Campbell\"; so in Shahpur, Jah\u00e1n\u00e1, the son of Bakhsh\u00fa of the T\u00e1tr\u00ed clan is among T\u00e1tr\u00eds known as \"Jah\u00e1n\u00e1 Bakhsh\u00fa d\u00e1,\" but to other people as \"Jah\u00e1n\u00e1 T\u00e1tr\u00ed.\" The clan is almost more important than the tribe, as the mutual agnatic relationship of men of the same clan is more fully recognized.\n\nWithin the clan comes a still narrower group of agnates which may be called the family (kabila), also consisting of agnates descended from a common male ancestor, not very remote, and much resembling the family group among European nations, except that the agnatic family group is much more clearly marked off from the relations through females only in the ideas of a Shahpur peasant than is the case in Europe; for instance, a sister's son, though recognized as a near relation, holds a very different position from a brother's son, who is one of the nearest agnates. Indeed all through the system of relationship, relations through females are described by entirely different names from relations through males, and are classed entirely apart from them. The basis of the whole family and tribal system is agnatic relationship, the agnatic family having developed in the course of time into the agnatic clan, and that again into what is, in theory at least, the agnatic tribe.\n\nThe castes and tribes of most importance in point of numbers are shown in the following table, in which they are arranged partly according to occupation and partly according to the\nplace they occupy in the social scale according to the general estimation of the people:\n\n| Tribe | Prevalent religion | Prevalent occupation | Total number | Percentage of total population |\n|-------|-------------------|---------------------|--------------|-------------------------------|\n| Biloch | Musalm\u00e1n          | Agriculture         | 13,661       | 2                             |\n| Path\u00e1n | Ditto             | Ditto               | 6,747        | 1                             |\n| Rajp\u00fat | Ditto             | Ditto               | 37,943       | 5                             |\n| Jat    | Musalm\u00e1n & Sikh   | Ditto               | 164,355      | 24                            |\n| Aw\u00e1n   | Musalm\u00e1n          | Ditto               | 67,147       | 9-5                           |\n| Khokar | Ditto             | Ditto               | 21,858       | 3                             |\n| Ar\u00e1in  | Ditto             | Market gardening    | 12,504       | 2                             |\n\nA.\u2014Dominant Landowning Tribes.\n\nB.\u2014Priestly Classes.\n\n| Brahman | Hindu | Receipt of offerings | 6,316 | 1 |\n| Sayad   | Musalm\u00e1n | Receipt of offerings and Agriculture | 13,156 | 2 |\n| Ulama   | Ditto | Mosque service and teaching | 1,093 | |\n| Sheikh  | Ditto | Miscellaneous | 3,489 | 5 |\n| Qureshi | Ditto | Ditto | 5,028 | 1 |\n\nC.\u2014Mercantile Classes.\n\n| Arora   | Hindu and Sikh | Money-lending and shopkeeping | 47,063 | 7 |\n| Khatri  | Ditto | Ditto ditto | 18,519 | 3 |\n| Khoja   | Musalm\u00e1n | Trade | 3,856 | 5 |\n\nD.\u2014Artisans and Mentals.\n\n| Sun\u00e1r   | Hindu and Musalm\u00e1n | Silversmiths and money-lenders | 5,707 | 1 |\n| Tarkh\u00e1n | Musalm\u00e1n | Carpenters | 17,689 | 25 |\n| Loh\u00e1r   | Ditto | Blacksmiths | 8,443 | 1 |\n| Kumh\u00e1r  | Ditto | Potters | 16,888 | 25 |\n| Jul\u00e1h\u00e1  | Ditto | Weavers | 26,300 | 4 |\n| N\u00e1i     | Ditto | Barbers | 10,886 | 15 |\n| Teli    | Ditto | Oilmakers | 3,823 | 5 |\n| M\u00f3chhi  | Ditto | Bakers | 16,141 | 2 |\n| Qass\u00e1b  | Ditto | Butchers | 8,254 | 1 |\n| Dhobi   | Ditto | Waabermen | 8,301 | 1 |\n| Mochi and Cham\u00e1r | Musalm\u00e1n and Hindu | Leather workers | 24,478 | 35 |\n| Mir\u00e1si  | Musalm\u00e1n | Bard-musicians | 13,085 | 2 |\n| Musalli | Ditto | Menial labourers | 58,278 | 8 |\n| Ch\u00fahra  | Hindu | Ditto | 5,474 | 1 |\n\nThe tribes notified as agricultural under the Alienation of Land Act are Ahir, Ar\u00e1in, Aw\u00e1n, Biloch, Gujjar, Jat, Kamboh, Khokhar, Mali\u00e1r, Mughal, Path\u00e1n, Qureshi, Rajp\u00fat, and Sayad. There is a list in the Deputy Commissioner's office showing what sub-tribes are subsumed under these heads; the supplement to Table No. 15 shows the most important sub-divisions of Jats and Rajputs.\nThe Biloch, who form more than two per cent. of the total population, have increased from 10,583 to 13,661, or by 29 per cent. In this district they are a fairly distinct tribe, and the term is seldom applied to camelmen who are not true Biloch, except perhaps in the Bhera Tahsil, where the tribe owns little land. In this district they are found chiefly in the Shahpur (4,536) and Khush\u00e1b (4,487) Tahsils. In Shahpur and Sargodha they own 21 estates with an area of 39,155 acres and in Khush\u00e1b 15 estates with an area of 65,669 acres. They are found chiefly (1) round Khush\u00e1b where before Ranjit Singh\u2019s time they held independent sway, and again (2) on both sides of the Jhelum about Sah\u00edw\u00e1l which was the seat of another ruling family of this tribe. Its leaders are now Sard\u00e1r Bah\u00e1dur Kh\u00e1n of Khush\u00e1b and Sard\u00e1r Mohammad Chir\u00e1gh Kh\u00e1n* of Sah\u00edw\u00e1l, both Divisional Darb\u00e1ries. The Biloches are only fair agriculturists, and some of them are extravagant. They furnish many good cavalry recruits, especially from the village of Jamali in the Thal. The principal clans are the Lagh\u00e1ri, Lash\u00e1ri and Rind, but these account for a very small proportion of the whole. Only one man in the district is returned as speaking Bilochi.\n\nThe Path\u00e1ns number 6,747 against 3,197 at last settlement. Of these the 2,914 Pashtu-speakers were probably coolies and merchants only temporarily resident in the district. There are one or two Path\u00e1n villages in the Bhera (853) and Shahpur (1,746) Tahsils, but the Path\u00e1ns are chiefly found in the north-west corner of the Khush\u00e1b Tahsil (2,200) in which they own 23,312 acres. Here we are just on the border of the territory occupied by the cis-Indus Path\u00e1ns of the Bannu District. They are fairly good agriculturists, but somewhat extravagant and hot-tempered. This tribe owns altogether some 58,000 acres in the district.\n\nThe remaining land-owning tribes may almost all be treated of together, as they are of similar character and apparently of similar origin, whatever their traditions to the contrary. A Shahpur peasant when asked his tribe will generally give his local clan-name, such as Jh\u00e1wari, Mekan, Midh, Kalas. These names are very similar to the clan-names of the Scottish Highlands or to ordinary English surnames, and indeed are in the district sometimes used in much the same way (a usage not common in the east of the Province); for instance, a witness telling a story will say Jal\u00e1l Mekan did this, or Nabbu T\u00e1rar did that, just as one might speak of Neil Maclean or Peter Jackson. When a\n\n*Died May 1916.\nman bears the same clan-name as another, it means that they are related to each other through agnates, for only agnates take the clan-name, a daughter's son taking the clan-name of his father not of his mother. This again is the same as in England where (within limits) all the Macleans in a community would be agnates of each other, and all the Jacksons of each other. When a peasant is further asked what great tribe he belongs to, he will, if an ignorant man, be unable to tell; if a man of ordinary intelligence, he will probably say, \"We join with the Bhattis\" or Khokhars or some other well-known tribe, or he may say \"We are originally Chohan Rajputs.\" If asked, whether he is a Rajput or Jat, he will, unless an unusually humble-minded man, say he is a Rajput. But the distinction is by no means certain, and there are many tribes, some members of which would call themselves Jats, and some Rajputs, or which some of their neighbours would admit to be Rajputs while others would call them Jats. There are a few tribes which, whether from their higher pretensions or from their having occupied a more important position than their fellows, are generally admitted in the neighbourhood to be of Rajput descent, while others do not even claim this honour for themselves. The fact is that the distinction is one of rank, not of descent, and that in this district Rajput simply means an agriculturist of high rank and Jat means an ordinary agriculturist with no such pretensions. The chief practical distinction between them is that the so-called Rajput is more particular about the tribes and families with which he will exchange daughters in marriage than the Jat is.\n\nThere are other tribes again which call themselves neither Jat nor Rajput, and yet evidently belong to the same great race as the others. For instance the Khokhars, who have here been reckoned separately in this census, sometimes claim to be descended from Qutb Shah of Ghazni, and so to be of Arab descent, but many of them return themselves as Rajput or Jat,\u2020 and there can be no doubt that they are of the same race as their neighbours. The Awans again make a still stronger claim to Arab origin, but they too are probably of the same race as the Jats. Another distinction arises in this way. An ordinary Jat attains some fame as a holy man, and hands the saintly character down to his descendants, who are called Pirs or Mianas. After a generation or\n\n* e.g., Bhattis, Mekans, Joyas; in some cases, tribes which were recorded as Rajputs in 1901 became Jats in 1911, e.g., Ranjhas, Dhandhis and Gondals. In 1911 there were only 37,243 Rajputs in the district, as against 73,177 in 1901, 75,331 in 1891, and 82,290 in 1881. This clearly shows that the local aristocracy are tending to become more exclusive.\n\n\u2020 In the 1911 Census, apart from the 21,853 persons recorded as Khokhars, there were 5,288 Khokhar Jats, and 1,772 Khokhar Rajputs.\ntwo they claim an Arab origin, and as the fancy takes them, call themselves either Sayad or Qureshi; soon their true origin is forgotten and the Arab origin is believed by themselves and generally admitted by their neighbours.\n\nSir James Wilson was of opinion that, with few exceptions, all the land-owning Muslam\u00e1n tribes of this district, whether calling themselves Jat, R\u00e1jp\u00fat, Khokhar, Aw\u00e1n, Sayad, or Qureshi are of one Aryan race and were formerly Hind\u00fas. Pandit Hari Kishan Kaul, who is intimately acquainted with the adjoining tract to the west, is strongly of the same opinion (vide page 447 of the 1911 Census Report). Their common dialect, common customs and similarity of physique and character are strong evidence of a community of descent and race. There is, however, great practical importance in recognising the difference of tribe. Men of one clan-name look upon each other as agnates and have a fellow-feeling with each other which affects their daily intercourse. Clans which on both sides admit a common origin are more closely connected with each other than with other clans by the vague feeling of relationship, and are often more ready to intermarry with each other than with other unrelated clans. Members of a tribe which is generally admitted to be of R\u00e1jp\u00fat origin are more likely to receive respect from their neighbours than a mere Jat. And a man who is generally believed to be a Sayad or Qureshi is sure of some reverence from all true Musalm\u00e1ns.\n\nThe most convenient way of describing the main Musalm\u00e1n land-owning tribes of indigenous origin will be to take them in order of locality beginning at the Chen\u00e1b and ending at the Salt Range:\n\n| Town       | Population |\n|------------|------------|\n| Bhera      | 6,008      |\n| Shahpur    | 314        |\n| Khush\u00e1b   | 209        |\n| Sargodha   | 1,005      |\n| **Total district** | **7,536** |\n\nIn that part of the Chen\u00e1b river valley which is included in this district the principal tribe are the R\u00e1njh\u00e1s who own there, in 54 estates, more than 68,000 acres. Their villages are very compact and they are only found in any numbers in the immediately adjoining portion of Gujrat District up the river, or in Gujr\u00e1nw\u00e1la across the river. Their numbers in this district have only increased since last census from 7,065 to 7,536, or by 2 per cent. They are a tribe of doubtful rank but are now\nclassed as Jats. They are on the whole a peaceable and well disposed section of the population, subsisting chiefly by agriculture, which they practise well and carefully.\n\n| Town     | Population |\n|----------|------------|\n| Bhera    | 2,194      |\n| Shahpur  | 893        |\n| Khush\u00e1b  | 211        |\n| Sargodha | 703        |\n| **Total district** | **4,001** |\n\nSouth of the R\u00e1njh\u00e1s in the Chen\u00e1b valley come the Chadhars, another very similar tribe, also of doubtful rank. Their headquarters are in the Jhang District down the river. In this district they own about 8,000 acres towards the Chen\u00e1b valley, and elsewhere are chiefly tenants.\n\n| Town     | Population |\n|----------|------------|\n| Bhera    | 922        |\n| Shahpur  | 338        |\n| Khush\u00e1b  | 72         |\n| Sargodha | 442        |\n| **Total district** | **1,774** |\n\nIn the same neighbourhood are three estates owned by the Sipr\u00e1s, another Jhang tribe, who own about 7,000 acres in the Chen\u00e1b valley and are chiefly tenants elsewhere in the district.\n\nA small area on the Jhang border is also held by Rih\u00e1ns, L\u00e1l\u00eds and Nissuw\u00e1n\u00e1s, tribes chiefly found in Jhang.\n\n| Town     | Population |\n|----------|------------|\n| Bhera    | 12,962     |\n| Shahpur  | 1,459      |\n| Khush\u00e1b  | 5,224      |\n| Sargodha | 8,978      |\n| **Total district** | **28,623** |\n\nThe chief tribe of the Bhera B\u00e1r are the Gondals, who occupy a fairly respectable place in the social scale and call themselves R\u00e1jp\u00fats, though now classed officially as Jats. They stretch across the whole Doab in the adjoining portions of the Guj\u00e1t and Shahpur Districts, from the Chen\u00e1b valley to the Jhelum river and across it into the Jhelum District. In Bhera they own nearly 74,000 acres in 44 villages. Their numbers are returned as 33 per cent. above last settlement. Physically they are a fine race, tall, strong and well made, and until recently they\nwere a pastoral people subsisting almost entirely on the produce of their large herds of cattle. Since the introduction of British rule, however, they have gradually been taking more and more to agriculture to which they now devote a considerable amount of attention and skill. They are still greatly addicted to cattle theft, which was formerly considered an honourable pursuit, and but few of them have taken service in the army for which they seem well fitted.\n\n| Harrals | Laks |\n|---------|------|\n| Bhera   | 1,047 | 746 |\n| Shahpur | 404   | 1,419 |\n| Khush\u00e1b | 16    | 71  |\n| Sargodha| 643   | 920 |\n\nTotal district ... 2,110 3,156\n\nIn the B\u00e1r, south-west of the Gondals, come the similar cattle-owning, cattle-stealing tribes of Harral and Lak, the former of whom own over 11,000 acres in the Bhera B\u00e1r and the latter nearly 20,000 acres in Bhera and Sargodha, and then the Nagy\u00e1ns, a holy clan, small in numbers but owning some 15,000 acres in the Shahpur riverain and Sargodha B\u00e1r.\n\n| Jats | R\u00e1jputs |\n|------|---------|\n| Bhera | 735     | 1,890 |\n| Shahpur | 1,471 | 1,299 |\n| Khush\u00e1b | 261    | 1,641 |\n| Sargodha | 1,741 | 1,597 |\n\nTotal district ... 4,311 6,427\n\nTurning now to the valley of the Jhelum we find, west of the Gondals all along the river from Mi\u00e1ni to Shahpur, the agricultural population consisting of a number of comparatively small and unimportant clans, some of which class themselves as Bhatt\u00eds and some as Khokhars. Of these two terms the latter has more significance here and does apparently mean a close connection between the clans calling themselves by that name, but the term Bhatti is very loosely used, and signifies no real connection between different clans. If a Jat in the Jhelum riverain after having mentioned his clan-name is pressed to give a wider tribal name, he will probably, unless he is a Khokhar, say he is a Bhatti, just as a Gondal in the B\u00e1r will say he is a Chauh\u00e1n, and in each case with equal truth. These so called\nBhatt\u00eds also own a considerable area south of Shahpur, and altogether in the Shahpur and Sargodha Tahs\u00edls Bhatt\u00eds own 27 estates and about 27,000 acres. They are fairly industrious peasants but greatly wanting in thrift and deeply in debt as a rule.\n\n| Khokhar | Khokhar Jat | Khokhar Rajputs |\n|---------|-------------|----------------|\n| Bhera   | 2,530       | 2,132          |\n| Shahpur | 10,595      | 1,219          |\n| Khush\u00e1b | 6,476       | 609            |\n| Sargodha| 2,257       | 1,328          |\n\nTotal district | 21,858 | 5,288 | 1,772\n\nOn both sides of the Jhelum, from about Mian\u00ed down to the Jhang border and on into Jhang, there are many villages owned by clans calling themselves Khokhar, either as their only designation or as a secondary tribal name in addition to their local clan-name. Although used somewhat vaguely by some clans, it has a more definite meaning than Bhatti, and the Khokhars are here a fairly compact tribe of the ordinary Punjabi Musalm\u00e1n type, and evidently of indigenous origin, notwithstanding the claim some of them make to be descended from Qutab Shah of Arab blood. The Khokhars own 10 villages and over 50,000 acres in the Bhera Tahsil, but are most numerous in the south of the Shahpur Tahsil near the Jhang border. In that neighbourhood they and cognate tribes claiming Khokhar descent own 68 estates and more than 50,000 acres, while in Khush\u00e1b they own in 31 villages, and have nearly 100,000 acres. So that the Khokhars may be said to be the principal land-owning tribe of the Shahpur Tahsil as the Gondals are in Bhera. At last settlement 24,040 persons were returned as Khokhars: the number now returned is 28,918, an increase of 20 per cent., but this includes the Khokhar Jats and Khokhar Rajputs.\n\n| Mekans | Jhammats |\n|--------|----------|\n|        | Jats     | Rajputs |\n| Bhera  | 2,751    | 22      |\n| Shahpur| 1,407    | 1,554   |\n| Khush\u00e1b| 822      | 8       |\n| Sargodha| 455     | 1       |\n\nTotal district | 5,435 | 1,584 | 2,643\n\nAmong the other Punj\u00e1bi Musalm\u00e1n land-owning clans of the Jhelum valley are the indigenous clan of Mekans, a\ncompact clan, found chiefly immediately to the east and south of Shahpur. In the Shahpur and Sargodha Tahsils they own in 39 estates more than 50,000 acres, and so come little behind the Khokhars in importance as landowners. They were formerly noted for turbulence, but have now settled down more or less quietly to agriculture and are fairly prosperous. Some of the leading members of this tribe, who have their head-quarters in Kot Bhai Khan and Kot Pahlwan, are very well-to-do, and have a considerable reputation as horse-breeders. The rank and file have still a bad name for cattle-lifting. Related to them are the Jhammats, another compact local clan, returned as Rajputs, who own 12 villages and 17,500 acres immediately south of Shahpur. They are bad managers and many of them in debt. They have alienated nearly 10,000 acres since settlement.\n\nEast of Sahiwali, and in the neighbourhood of Sargodha, are the Kalears:\n\n|                | Jats | Rajputs |\n|----------------|------|---------|\n| Bhera          | ...  | 198     |\n| Shahpur        | ...  | 356     |\n| Khushab        | ...  | 133     |\n| Sargodha       | ...  | 28      |\n| Total district | 715  | 2,177   |\n\nThey are a tribe whose influence is quite out of proportion to its numbers, and dates from the time when the Kirana Bar was dedicated to the camel and the cow. One Allahyar, Kalar, made a great name for himself by organising the business of cattle theft in such a way as to win respect both from the thieves (for whom he provided a clearing-house) and also from the administration (which he was prudent enough to assist considerably). The ethnology of the clan is even more doubtful than usual; in the 1901 census and in the revenue records of Shahpur Tahsil, they are classed with the Biloches, probably on account of their interest in camels; but in the 1911 census and the revenue records of Sargodha Tahsil, they hesitate between Jat and Rajput; so that it appears eminently probable that they too are of the same stock as the tribes already mentioned. The Kalears own about 15,000 acres of land in Shahpur and Sargodha Tahsils.\n\nIn the valley of the Jhelum on the Khushab side, the principal land-owning tribes are the Biloch, Khokhar and Bhatti.\nalready mentioned. The only other tribe of any importance are the Joyas:\n\n| Damohant land-owning tribes\u2014 | Jats | Rajputs |\n|-----------------------------|------|---------|\n| Bhera                       | ...  | 562     |\n| Shahpur                     | ...  | 271     |\n| Khush\u00e1b                     | ...  | 1,960   |\n| Sargodha                    | ...  | 51      |\n\nTotal district: ... 2,844 514\n\nThey are a tribe of zamind\u00e1r status, owning 8 villages and nearly 37,000 acres in this tahsil, south of Khush\u00e1b. They are quiet, industrious cultivators.\n\n| The Tiw\u00e1na |\n|------------|\n| Bhera      | ... | 10 |\n| Shahpur    | ... | 192 |\n| Khush\u00e1b    | ... | 1,278 |\n| Sargodha   | ... | 60 |\n\nTotal district: ... 1,540\n\nIn the Thal country west of Khush\u00e1b by far the most remarkable land-owning tribe are the Tiw\u00e1na, a fairly compact local tribe, who have by their strong right hand gained for themselves in comparatively recent times an importance out of all proportion to their numbers. Notwithstanding their claims to high Hindu descent and their pedigree reaching back through Ham and Noah to Adam, they were until about a century ago an ordinary Punjabi Musalm\u00e1n tribe inhabiting a few villages at the north of the Thal desert. After a severe struggle with their neighbours, the Aw\u00e1ns, the head of the clan established independent authority over the Thal, and even after the Sikhs under Ranjit Singh brought them under subjection they found it advisable to employ the Tiw\u00e1na chief as their local Governor. On the outbreak of the Second Sikh War the Tiw\u00e1na took the British side, and by their bravery and loyalty, both then and in the mutiny, gained great distinction and high reward. They are still much valued as cavalry soldiers, and many of them are serving in the Army, which perhaps accounts for the fact that they are almost the only tribe in the district of which there were more females than males resident at the time of the census (785 females to 755 males). The great war of 1914 has given the tribe a fresh opportunity to prove its worth, and has not found it wanting. Recruits have come forward in large\nnumbers and two of the leading Maliks obtained positions on the staff, and have both been mentioned in despatches. Several of the members of the chief Tiw\u00e1na family have titles and jagirs and seats in Darb\u00e1r. They have also obtained grants of waste land on the inundation canals from the Jhelum in the Shahpur Tahs\u00edl (where they hold 12 estates and about 30,000 acres), and squares, amounting to 4,300 acres in the Lower Jhelum Colony, besides the 12 estates and 85,000 acres owned by them in the Khush\u00e1b Tahs\u00edl. Their number was returned as 3,202 in 1881 and 2,790 in 1891. The apparent decrease is mainly due to more correct classification. It is possible that enlistment in the army may have helped to reduce the numbers, but undoubtedly the increased exclusiveness of the clan (who are not unnaturally jealous of their reputation) is mainly responsible. In the same way the N\u00fans, who are closely connected with the best Tiw\u00e1na families by marriage, have dropped from 1,213 in 1901 to 599 in 1911. The Wadhals of Had\u00e1li are acknowledged by the N\u00fans and Tiw\u00e1n\u00e1s as their social equals, but tribes such as the G\u00e1jris and M\u00e1hls who have won much military distinction in Tiw\u00e1na regiments are still somewhat inferior in status. It is not unusual for members of other Thal clans to call themselves Tiw\u00e1nas, and many of the men enlisted in the army as Tiw\u00e1nas do not belong to the true Tiw\u00e1na clan.*\n\nThe other villages in the Thal are owned by various petty clans which are little known and have no claim to R\u00e1jp\u00fat rank: they are principally shepherds, tall, strong and of primitive ways ready to migrate with their flocks and herds according to the changes of the season.\n\n|        | Aw\u00e1ns | Jats |\n|--------|-------|------|\n| Bhera  | ...   | 5,656| 207 |\n| Shahpur| ...   | 5,584| 218 |\n| Khush\u00e1b| ...   | 50,213| 175 |\n| Sargodha| ...   | 4,525| 619 |\n| Total district | ... | 65,928| 1,219 |\n\nNorth of the Thal come the very compact tribe of the Aw\u00e1ns, who hold practically the whole of that part of the Salt Range which is included in the Shahpur District, and the greater portion of the plain lying at its foot. They own all but one of the\n\n*In revenue proceedings, cases occur in which individuals have to reconcile their military credentials with their civil rights by proclaiming themselves \"Mir\u00e1s\u00ed Tiw\u00e1na.\"\nKhush\u00e1b Salt Rang villages, and nine-tenths of the cultivated area of that circle. They are essentially the tribe of the Salt Range in this neighbourhood and extend north and east into the Attock, Jhelum and Rawalpindi Districts. A number of them are also scattered as tenants in the villages across the Jhelum, and they own over 10,000 acres in 22 villages of the Bhera Tahsil, and 9 villages and 9,863 acres in the Shahpur Tahsil, besides 6,383 acres in Sargodha. They are distinctly a peasant tribe; and although they claim to be descended from Alif Shah, known also as Qutab Shah, and through him from Ali, son-in-law of the Prophet, they are, so far as language, customs and physique go, an indigenous Panjabi tribe. They are a brave and high spirited race, but prone to keeping alive old feuds and given to quarrelling, which often leads to riots and ruinous litigation. They are excellent cultivators and display beaver-like industry in maintaining their complicated system of irrigation from the mountain torrents by means of embankments and terraces, and reclaiming land from the steep hillsides. They are keen horsemen, and are always delighted to enter for a competition in tent-pegging (chapli). Their numbers were returned at last settlement as 52,526, and now 67,147, an increase of 28 per cent. A considerable number of them have taken service in the Army and Military Police and make good soldiers.\n\n|                | Bhera | Shahpur | Khush\u00e1b | Sargodha |\n|----------------|-------|---------|---------|----------|\n|                | ...   | ...     | ...     | ...      |\n|                | 1,101 | 186     | 1,621   | 371      |\n\nTotal district ... 3,279\n\nNorth of Khush\u00e1b towards the Jhelum border are three villages with 16,393 acres owned by the Janj\u00fahas, a tribe found chiefly further north in Jhelum and Rawalpindi. They are admittedly of high rank and claim a Rajput descent, but are more probably the descendants of the aristocracy among the Aw\u00e1ns, just as the Rajputs are the aristocracy of the Jats and the Kh\u00e1nzadas of the Meos in Gurgaon.\n\nTheir members were returned in 1881 as 3,766, but now as only 3,279, probably a result of more careful classification. They make good cavalry soldiers.\n\nOf the minor land-owning and cultivating tribes the only ones of importance are:\u2014(1) The Ar\u00e1\u00edns (12,504 against 8,236 at last settlement), who are chiefly found in the Jhelum Valley and\nespecially near the large towns and villages where they ply their occupation of market-gardening: with them may be grouped the Maliy\u00e1rs (3,798 against 1,953), who were once the main owners in some villages round Bhera, but have now sold much of their land; they too are skilful market-gardeners; indeed the terms Ar\u00e1in and Maliy\u00e1r practically mean \"market-gardener\" and it is probable that many now calling themselves by these names from their occupation originally belonged to other tribes. They are a quiet, industrious people, the men usually cultivating small plots of land on wells and jhal\u00e1rs, while the women carry the green produce for sale to the neighbouring towns and villages.\n\nThe high percentage of infirmities among Ar\u00e1ins is noticeable and may be due to the great use they make of town manure. They own little land but are valued as tenants, and are, as cultivators, the best of the colonists. (2) There are a few Ah\u00edrs (1,540), owning land chiefly in Khush\u00e1b and near S\u00e1hiw\u00e1l. They are ordinary Musalm\u00e1n peasants like their neighbours. (3) The Dhud\u00eds (1,405) are an ordinary peasant tribe owning a little land in the Jhelum Valley. (4) The Si\u00e1ls (948) are an offshoot from the great Jhang tribe and own little land in this district, being chiefly found towards the Jhang border. (5) The Mughals (1,996) are probably for the most part indigenous Punj\u00e1b\u00eds who have called themselves by the name of a ruling race just as others call themselves R\u00e1jp\u00fat, Sheikh or Sayad. (6) The T\u00e1rars (1,729) are an offshoot from the Gujr\u00e1t tribe of that name and are found chiefly in Bhera Tahs\u00edl where they own a little land. (7) The Kambohs (1,299, of whom 4 are Hind\u00fas, and 96 are Sikhs) are really of three distinct kinds:\u2014(a) the Kambohs of Bhera and Sada Kamboh in Shahpur Tahs\u00edl; although they own about 5,000 acres of land, they are not much given to agriculture, but devote themselves largely to Government service, especially in the Revenue Department. They are connected with the Q\u00e1n\u00fan\u00f3 Sheikhs of Bhera, and would, if they were less improvident, be men of considerable wealth: (b) the peasant Kambohs found in the south of Shahpur Tahs\u00edl; an industrious tribe with small holdings: (c) the colonists from the Central Punjab, who are, as agriculturists, almost in the same class as Ar\u00e1ins.\n\nIn addition to the old established tribes of the district, much new blood has of course come in, by reason of migration to the colony. Among these may be mentioned the Gujjars (2,004) who are mostly from Gujr\u00e1t, and have generally settled in Bhera and Sargodha Tahs\u00edls; and about 3,000 Jats (including some 7,000 Sikhs and 1,000 Hind\u00fas) of whom the most numerous district clans are the Ch\u00edmas (3,050), the War\u00e1iches...\nThe Brahmans are found chiefly in the large towns and villages of the Jhelum Valley, where their Hindu clients live. They own very little land in this district and chiefly confine themselves to religious or semi-religious occupations, such as performing ceremonies, casting horoscopes and receiving the offerings of the pious. Few of them have any real knowledge of Sanskrit or more than a smattering of religious lore. Their numbers at last settlement were given as 5,455. Among them are included the Muhi\u00e1ls, who are more addicted to employment in the Civil Service than to strictly Brahmanical occupations.\n\nAt last settlement the Sayads were returned as 9,506, so that there is an apparent increase of 38 per cent. A large proportion of these so-called Sayads are probably of indigenous descent and have come to be considered as Sayads because descended from some holy man who handed down his saintly character to his posterity. The Sayad proper is a p\u00edr reverenced and respected by the faithful, who support him by their offerings and sometimes gift to him a portion of their land. But in this district there are several large colonies of land-owning Sayads especially near Bhera and round Shahpur, where a Sayad family held semi-independent sway before Ranjit Singh subjugated the country. In the Shahpur Tahsil they hold 17 villages and over 20,000 acres, as well as about 35,000 acres in other tahsils. They are unthrifty, bad managers, and for the most part in debt to their Hindu neighbours.\nAt last settlement the Ulma were returned as 3,141. In fact Ulma is not the name of a tribe or caste. A Musalm\u00e1n of any tribe if he learns enough Arabic to conduct the services in the mosque and teach the village boys to read the Kor\u00e1n by rote is called an Ulma, but his original tribe is not forgotten, and if his descendants do not continue to act as mosque attendants they will be not known as Ulma but as belonging to their proper tribe. In 1911 many Ulma must have been returned under the name of their proper tribe.\n\n| Bhera     | ... | ... | ... | 1,195 |\n|-----------|-----|-----|-----|-------|\n| Shahpur   | ... | ... | ... | 1,479 |\n| Khush\u00e1b   | ... | ... | ... | 1,634 |\n| Sargodha  | ... | ... | ... | 720   |\n| **Total district** | ... | ... | ... | **5,028** |\n\nProbably very few of the Qureshi inhabitants of this district are of true Arab descent. A Punjabi, who has attained a reputation for piety and become revered as a p\u00edr, transmits an odour of sanctity to his descendants, which if it does not make them Sayads will probably make them Qureshis. Altogether this tribe is recorded as owning about 4,000 acres in Bhera, 5,000 in Shahpur, and 14,000 in Khush\u00e1b. Two of them are zaid\u00e1rs \u2014 Mi\u00e1n Muhammad Hay\u00e1t of Sahbow\u00e1l, and P\u00edr Chan P\u00edr of Pail \u2014 each of whom has by his personal character and public spirit done much to justify their families\u2019 superior status. At last settlement the Qureshis were enumerated as Sheikhs, of whom there were 6,718, but this number included most of those who are now enumerated separately under that name.\n\n| Bhera     | ... | ... | ... | 1,583 |\n|-----------|-----|-----|-----|-------|\n| Shahpur   | ... | ... | ... | 870   |\n| Khush\u00e1b   | ... | ... | ... | 810   |\n| Sargodha  | ... | ... | ... | 635   |\n| **Total district** | ... | ... | ... | **3,898** |\n\nThe Fakirs, who in this district are almost all Musalm\u00e1ns, also generally assume a religious character and make use of blessings or curses, as the case may be, to expedite the almsgivings of the faithful. They are for the most part simply lazy beggars who find a roving mendicant\u2019s life more to their taste than one of monotonous industry. In some parts of the district they have acquired land by gift, but are rapidly losing it to their more thrifty neighbours. At last settlement the number of\nFak\u00edrs was only 1,429, so they have nearly trebled in the past 20 years. This does not of course mean more than that a number of people have succumbed to the temptation to become parasites on the greatly increased wealth of the community.\n\nThe Bhar\u00e1\u00eds (790) go about beating drums and begging in the name of Sakhi Sawar.\n\n| The Sheikhs | Bheta | ... | ... | 1,589 |\n|-------------|-------|-----|-----|-------|\n|             | Shahpur | ... | ... | 478   |\n|             | Khush\u00e1b | ... | ... | 609   |\n|             | Sargodha | ... | ... | 813   |\n|             | Total district | ... | ... | 3,489 |\n\nThe Sheikhs of this district may generally be divided into three classes:\u2014(a) ordinary Punj\u00e1bi agriculturists, who have adopted this name as a mark of special respectability; they rank rather lower in the public estimation than the Qureshis; of this kind are the Sheikhs of Malakw\u00e1l (now transferred to Gujr\u00e1t District) and Chak Sheikh\u00e1n, near Jhawari\u00e1n; (b) Muhamma-dans who have devoted themselves largely to civil service; such are the Sheikh Q\u00e1n\u00edngos of Bhera town, who own 836 acres of land, largely by purchase, in Bhera and its neighbourhood; (c) recent converts to Isl\u00e1m from castes not recognized as Musalm\u00e1n. It is now only by a considerable straining of the truth that Sheikhs can be included among the priestly castes.\n\nPractically the whole of the trade of the district is in the hands of four castes, the Aroras, Khatr\u00ed (including Bh\u00e1tias), Khojas and Pir\u00e1chas, the two former castes Hindu and the two latter Musalm\u00e1n. The Khojas (3,856 against 3,426 at last settlement) and the Pir\u00e1chas (who numbered 598 in 1891 and 667 in 1901, but have now classed themselves as Khojas) are found chiefly in Bhera, Shahpur and Mi\u00e1ni towns, where they do a considerable amount of trade, chiefly in cotton and grain. Some of them have dealings with Bombay and Kar\u00e1chi on the one hand and with Persia and Bukh\u00e1ra on the other. They own by purchase nearly 3,000 acres chiefly round Bhera.\n\nThe Khatr\u00ed and Aroras between them make up three-fourths of the total Hindu and Sikh population of the district. More than a fourth of them live in the towns and most of the remainder in the large villages, where they alone are the traders, shopkeepers and bankers of the community. They are a thrifty and intelligent body of men, much more patient and far seeing than the Musalm\u00e1n peasants, who are as a rule much indebted to them. By advancing small sums to the peasants at a\nhigh rate of interest and allowing it to accumulate until it is impossible for the peasant to pay, they have managed by the judicious use of our unsympathetic Civil Law to compel the peasants to part with a large proportion of their more valuable land by sale or mortgage, which in many cases is practically equivalent to a sale. The Khatri or Arora money-lender generally prefers a mortgage to a sale, as this does not expose him to a suit for pre-emption and he finds it easier to persuade his peasant debtor to mortgage than to sell his land. Yet since the regular settlement 55 years ago about 5 per cent. of the cultivated land in the Jhelum valley has passed by sale into the hands of money-lenders. Khatris are the chief owners of several estates in Bhera, and five in the Shahpur Tahsil, and own some 40,000 acres chiefly in the neighbourhood of the large towns, and of the flourishing village of Chak Ram Das which is owned entirely by a family of Khatris of long standing as landlords. Aroras own over 96,000 acres in the district, but nearly half of this consists of Thal land in the neighbourhood of Nurpur and Rangpur Baghur, while the remainder is in the neighbourhood of Sahiwal, Faruka, Khushab, Girot, Hadali and Mitha Tiwana. Both classes, however, hold in mortgage about 10 per cent. of the cultivated area of the Jhelum valley and a considerable proportion of the best proprietary land elsewhere, and altogether these two money-lending classes between them are responsible for about a fifth of the total fixed land revenue of the district. Altogether a very large share of the landlord's profits from the proprietary land of the district finds its way into their pockets. No class has benefited from the British Rule nearly so much as these Hindu money-lenders. Our laws and our principles of political economy treat thrift as almost the only virtue, and have given the patient and parsimonious shopkeeper an advantage he has not been slow to use over his thoughtless and extravagant Musalm\u00e1n neighbour; and so he has secured a command over much more than his share of the accumulated capital and even of the land of the district. The Khatris and Aroras too have been much more ready than the peasant classes to avail themselves of the means of education offered by our schools, and thus have improved their position and especially have secured a very large proportion of the appointments in our courts and offices. While among the Musalmans only about one male in fifty can read and write, more than one in three can do so among the Hindus and Sikhs; and more than half the males in the district having a knowledge of English belong to the Arora or Khatri caste. The Bhatis are in this district a sub-section of the Khatris.\nwith whom they eat. The numbers of these tribes are as follows:\n\n| Caste       | Tahsil Bhera | Tahsil Shahpur | Tahsil Khush\u00e1b | Tahsil Sarogdha | Total District | Hindu | Sikh |\n|-------------|--------------|----------------|----------------|-----------------|----------------|-------|------|\n| Khatri      | 10,859       | 1,322          | 3,485          | 2,358           | 18,519         | 14,598| 3,936|\n| Bh\u00e1tia      | 1,427        | 532            | 21             | 76              | 2,056          | 1,555 | 501  |\n| Arora       | 10,971       | 16,966         | 13,783         | 5,333           | 47,053         | 31,026| 16,027|\n\nThe Bhera Tahs\u00edl may be considered a sort of boundary between the Khatr\u00eds and Aroras. In this tahs\u00edl the numbers of the two castes are about equal. North of this in Jhelum and Rawalpindi the Khatr\u00eds greatly exceed the Aroras in number, while to the south and west, in the Shahpur and Khush\u00e1b Tahs\u00edls and in the Jhang and Mi\u00e1nw\u00e1li Districts the Aroras greatly outnumber the Khatr\u00eds. The Khatr\u00eds occupy a considerably higher rank in the social scale than the Aroras, and are, as a rule, more intelligent and enterprising and less pusillanimous. According to the statistics the increase of numbers since last settlement has been Khatr\u00eds and Bh\u00e1tias 12 per cent. and Aroras 15 per cent., so that apparently the Aroras are having the better of the Khatr\u00eds in this respect. The probable explanation is that plague has never been so fatal in Khush\u00e1b as it was in Bhera in 1904 and 1907. As regards religion 29 per cent. of the Khatr\u00eds and 34 per cent. of the Aroras have returned themselves as Sikhs, but some of them, especially of the Aroras, are only nominally Sikhs, and not very clearly distinguished from Hind\u00fas; the Khatri Sikhs, however, are generally more particular about their tenets and customs, and may mostly be considered true Sikhs.\n\nIn this district practically the whole of the artisan and menial classes are Musalm\u00e1n except the Sun\u00e1rs, many of whom are Hindu, and the Ch\u00fahras, many of whom still profess their own primitive religion. Some of the classes of artisans, such as Loh\u00e1rs, Jul\u00e1h\u00e1, Teli, Dhobi, are more trade-guilds than tribes, and a family giving up its traditional occupation and taking to another would, after a generation or two, be considered to belong to the caste whose common occupation it had adopted, so that\nthe different castes are not divided from each other by fixed and lasting boundaries. Still so strong is the tendency to follow the ancestral occupation and so closely are the persons belonging to each such caste or trade-guild inter-connected by community of occupation, which generally carries with it inter-marriage and similarity of social customs, that these well-recognised divisions are of real importance in the frame-work of society. In general estimation the different artisan castes take rank according to the nature of their usual occupation, workers in metal and wood ranking higher than workers in clay, and they again higher than workers in leather. Lower down, the distinction is partly made according to the nature of the food eaten, Mir\u00e1s\u00eds ranking low because they eat almost any one's leavings, and Ch\u00fahras lowest of all because they eat the flesh even of animals that have died a natural death.\n\nThe condition of these classes as a whole has greatly improved since the introduction of British rule. The enormous rise in the prices of agricultural produce and the rapid development of cultivation and irrigation have led to a great demand for the services of all whose work is connected with the operations of agriculture, and their remuneration has increased in proportion. Those who are paid in kind, such as the Tarkh\u00e1n, Loh\u00e1r, Kubh\u00e1r and Musalli, get a larger proportion of the produce, and its money value has greatly risen. The custom of paying in cash for all services required on State works, such as canals and railways, combined with the greater plenty of silver coin and the greater demand for labour of all kinds, has made it much more common to pay for services in cash than in kind, and has led to a marked rise in money wages, which taken along with the greater steadiness in the demand for labour, has benefited the lowest class of labourer more than he has suffered from the rise in prices. A much larger proportion of the lower castes than formerly have amassed some little wealth in coin or ornaments, and it is not uncommon to find members of the artisan castes in possession of plots of land as mortgagees. The demand for tenants to break up new land has led many of these castes to give up their traditional occupation and become cultivators, which means for them a distinct rise in the social scale and an improved means of subsistence.\n\nThe Sun\u00e1rs or Zargars (5,707 against 4,139 at last settlement, an increase of 38 per cent.) are the workers in gold and silver, and have much more employment than formerly in making up the jewellery in which form all classes of the people prefer to hoard their savings. Two-thirds of them are Hind\u00fas\nor Sikhs and one-third Musalm\u00e1n. They are chiefly found in large towns and villages. Many of them advance money on the security of ornaments. Some have a bad reputation as receivers of stolen jewels, the proceeds of house-breaking, which they melt down at once to avoid recognition.\n\nThe Tarkh\u00e1ns (17,089 against 12,568 at last settlement, an increase of 36 per cent.) do all the carpentry work of the district, making agricultural implements, the wood-work of the Persian-wheel, &c., generally in return for a customary payment in kind. They are also the brick-layers of wells and of buildings of burnt brick. They are found chiefly in the villages and are practically all Musalm\u00e1ns. The carpenters of Bhera and S\u00e1h\u00edw\u00e1l are noted for the carving of house-fronts and for lacquer work.\n\nThe Loh\u00e1rs (8,433 against 6,026 at last settlement, an increase of 40 per cent.) are the blacksmiths and workers in iron. They are practically all Musalm\u00e1ns and are found chiefly in the villages. They are regular agricultural menials receiving payment of customary dues in kind in return for their making and mending the iron part of agricultural implements, the customer furnishing the iron.\n\nThe Kubh\u00e1rs (16,888 against 14,164 at last settlement, an increase of 19 per cent.) are the potters, makers of bricks, and clay vessels. They are almost all Musalm\u00e1ns, live both in the towns and villages, are true agricultural menials and get customary dues in kind in return for making the earthenware vessels required for the Persian-wheel and for domestic use. Many of them also keep donkeys and act as petty carriers within the town or village area.\n\nThe Jul\u00e1has (26,300 against 25,888 at last settlement, an increase of 2 per cent.) are more generally called Paoli in this district. They are almost all Musalm\u00e1ns and are found not only in the towns but scattered through the villages all over the district. Their principal, almost their sole, occupation is weaving cotton and wool into cloth. They are paid not in kind but by the piece. A considerable quantity of coarse cotton cloth woven by them is exported towards Pesh\u00e1war and K\u00e1b\u00fal, but their occupation has suffered by the growing fashion for European and machine-made piece-goods. They are a turbulent class, ever ready to resent their position of inferiority to the peasantry and to rebel against the customary poll-tax or ground-rent imposed upon them by the landowners. Weavers are popularly credited with an allowance of intelligence inferior to that of their neighbours.\nMany people have been deceived by the mirages in the Chachh, but a weaver is said to have been seen laboriously wading across one! In Bhera there is a weavers' co-operative society, which promises well, but a similar venture in Khush\u00e1b soon came to an inglorious end. There is no doubt that collective bargaining would make a great difference to the wealth of this class, and they could also improve their income considerably by adopting the methods taught at the Ludhi\u00e1na School of Weaving. It is to be hoped that their supposed shortage of intellect will in time be cured by education, which they seem to ensue more eagerly than most Musalm\u00e1ns. The very small increase in their numbers is probably to be taken as meaning that they take freely to other occupations, and change their caste-name when they do so. As cotton-mills increase in the Punjab it is probable that the number of weavers will still further diminish.\n\nThe N\u00e1\u00eds (10,886 against 8,911 at last settlement, an increase of 22 per cent.) are found everywhere and are almost all Musalm\u00e1ns. They are the barbers of the country, even Hindus having their heads shaved by Musalm\u00e1n N\u00e1\u00eds. They also act as leeches, perform circumcision, and are the recognized messengers in the case of all domestic ceremonies, carrying notices of births, marriages, and, in this district also of deaths. In the villages they are paid in kind among the regular menials.\n\nThe Tel\u00eds (3,323 against 2,815 at last settlement, an increase of 18 per cent.) are all Musalm\u00e1ns and their occupation is oil-pressing. They are closely connected with the Qas\u00e1\u00eds or butchers (8,254 against 6,451 at last settlement, an increase of 26 per cent.) who are rather a trade-guild than a tribe and are most numerous in the large towns. Some of the Qas\u00e1\u00eds act as sheep-dealers or themselves keep flocks of sheep and goats which they breed for sale. Some of them have a bad reputation for helping to make away quickly with stolen cattle. The Penjas (62) or cotton-scutchers are generally Tel\u00eds by caste.\n\nThe M\u00e1chh\u00eds (16,141 against 12,646 at last settlement, an increase of 28 per cent.) are all Musalm\u00e1ns and are scattered all over the district. Their chief occupation is that of bakers, the men fetching the fuel and the women baking at their ovens the cakes brought by the village housewives and taking payment in kind at the time. Water-carrying is generally done by the people themselves. With the M\u00e1chh\u00eds may be classed the Jh\u00ednwars (850) who are for the most part Hindu or Sikh and have come into the colony recently.\n\nThe Mall\u00e1hs 1,371 against 1,017) are the boatmen of the rivers and are all Musalm\u00e1ns.\nThe Dhob\u00eds (8,301 against 6,457, an increase since last settlement of 27 per cent.) are the washermen and are almost all Musalm\u00e1ns. The Ch\u00edmbas (8) or calico-printers, and Lil\u00e1ris (96), Charohas or dyers, and Darz\u00eds (576) or tailors are generally of the Dhobi caste. They rank low as handling dirty clothes and keeping donkeys.\n\nThe Moch\u00eds (22,588 against 18,233 at last settlement, an increase of 23 per cent.) are all Musalm\u00e1ns. They are the workers in leather and rank low because they handle skins. In this district they generally confine themselves chiefly to making shoes and other leather-work besides tanning skins. The Mochi, whose perquisite the skins of dead cattle are, has benefited considerably by the great rise in the price of skins, but he is also beginning to find that owners prefer to sell the skins themselves.\n\nWith the Moch\u00eds may be classed the 1,890 Cham\u00e1rs, who are their Hindu or Sikh equivalents. They are practically all settlers in Sargodha Tahsil from outside districts, and five-sixths of them are Hind\u00fas.\n\nThe Mir\u00e1s\u00eds (13,035 against 10,339 at last settlement, an increase of 26 per cent.) are the bards, musicians and genealogists of the people, and their services are in request at all domestic functions and especially at marriages. Their women are often prostitutes and it is a noticeable fact that in this tribe almost alone of all tribes in the district the number of females exceeds that of males (6,931 females to 6,104 males), a fact which suggests that the ranks of their women are recruited otherwise than by birth within the caste. The Bh\u00e1ts (81) or bards may be mentioned along with the Mir\u00e1s\u00eds whom they resemble. The Mir\u00e1s\u00eds of the Salt Range are noted for their enterprise and audacity. They range all over the Punjab and even find their way to Calcutta. As soon as they are far enough from home to be safe from recognition they assume all sorts of dignities. There are tales of men who have earned much repute (as well as large emoluments) in the guise of Mahants in Mult\u00e1n. Others have made considerable sums as Professors of Music down-country. Their houses are generally about the handsomest in the village.\n\nThe Ods (936) are professional navvies, mostly quasi-Hindu by religion, who render invaluable aid in the excavation of canals. They are migrants, and have decreased in numbers by nearly 100 per cent. since 1901, when the construction of the Lower Jhelum Canal offered work for all.\n\nGenerally speaking a sweeper, if he is a Muhammadan, is called a Musalli, and if he is not, is called a Ch\u00fahra, but there is\nno tribal distinction, and some of the Muhammadan sweepers are still numbered among the Ch\u00fahras; in the census of 1901 and its predecessors no distinction was made. The distribution is as follows:\n\n| Tahsil | Ch\u00fahras | Musall\u00eds | Hind\u00fa | Sikh | Musalm\u00e1n |\n|--------|---------|----------|-------|------|----------|\n| Bhera  | 677     | 23,903   | 484   | 84   | 24,062   |\n| Shahpur| 84      | 11,233   | 67    | ...  | 11,250   |\n| Khush\u00e1b| 149     | 7,786    | 8     | ...  | 7,927    |\n| Sargodha| 4,564   | 13,351   | 3,973 | 396  | 13,548   |\n| **Total district** | **5,474** | **56,273** | **4,532** | **430** | **56,785** |\n| At last settlement | 35,401 | 4,747 | 177 | 30,477 |\n\nThey have increased by no less than 75 per cent. since last settlement; 2,495 Ch\u00fahras and 10,210 Musall\u00eds migrated to the colony from other districts, and if these are deducted, the increase is 38 per cent., or nearly 2 per cent. per annum, which is much higher than that of the population as a whole.\n\nBesides their traditional occupation of doing scavenger's work they are the chief field labourers and get payment at customary rates in kind for their assistance, especially at harvest time when whole families of them move about the country to help in reaping the grain getting as a rule every twenty-first sheaf, which sometimes means as much as a rupee a day. They are also the chief earth-diggers of the district and make large earnings at such work as making roads or clearing out canals, the usual rate of wages being Rs 3-0-0 per thousand cubic feet equivalent to about eight or twelve annas a day, while forty years ago the usual rate for such labour was less than two annas a day. The position of the Ch\u00fahras has been much improved by the great increase in the demand for labour, but they are an unthrifty hand-to-mouth class and are the first to feel the pinch of bad times. They are very ready to wander, and small encampments of them may often be seen at the roadside, the whole family moving about the country in search of food, with a small tent of rags, a cot or two, a bundle of clothes, a donkey and a few dogs as their whole\nworldly belongings. They furnish a considerable number of criminals, the Ch\u00fahra generally confining himself to petty thefts and house-breaking and leaving the more gentlemanly pursuit of cattle-theft to the Jat or R\u00e1jp\u00fat peasant. Few as the Mazhab\u00eds are here, they have furnished a few recruits to the Pioneer regiments. The Musall\u00eds are in this district admitted to unusually equal terms by the Musalm\u00e1ns, who accept water and food from their hands only requiring that they should be circumcised, should have repeated the Kalima and should have given up eating carrion or anything \"abominable.\" The unconverted Ch\u00fahra eats the leavings of anybody, the flesh of animals that have died a natural death, snakes, lizards, foxes, jackals, or as one of them put it, anything but dogs,\u2014he would even eat his donkey, if it happened to die.\n\nThe B\u00e1z\u00edgars (2,430) and Nats (386) may be taken together. The numbers at last settlement were 1,065 and 305, an increase of more than 100 per cent. They are acrobats and tumblers and have no fixed residence, but move about from place to place, living in moveable shelters made of grass, and using donkeys and camels to carry their goods about on. The B\u00e1z\u00edgars are almost all returned as Hind\u00fas and the Nats as Musalm\u00e1ns; both are a gipsy, almost outcaste, tribe living largely on the leavings of others and on jungle vermin. Their women used to have a reputation for chastity.\n\nThe S\u00e1ns\u00eds (673) are especially a jungle tribe, have no fixed residence, and are often found encamped in waste places where they capture and eat jungle vermin of all sorts. They are not a particularly criminal tribe in this district.\n\nThe total population of the district has increased by 39 per cent. since 1891, and we have seen that nearly half of this increase is due to immigration, and half to natural increase. How the increase has been distributed over the various occupations and castes can be judged from these figures:\n\n| Occupation | Caste       | Increase per cent |\n|------------|-------------|-------------------|\n| A\u2014Agriculture | Jat-R\u00e1jp\u00fat | ... | ... | ... | 64 |\n|            | Aw\u00e1n       | ... | ... | ... | 28 |\n|            | Khokhar    | ... | ... | ... | 20 |\n|            | Baloch     | ... | ... | ... | 29 |\n|            | Ar\u00e1ns-Maly\u00e1r | ... | ... | ... | 60 |\n| Occupation          | Caste       | Increase per cent |\n|--------------------|-------------|-------------------|\n| B.\u2014Religion        | Sayad       | 38                |\n|                    | Brahman     | 16                |\n|                    | Qureshi-Sheikh | 27              |\n| C.\u2014Business        | Khatri      | 13                |\n|                    | Arora       | 15                |\n|                    | Sun\u00e1r       | 38                |\n|                    | Tarkh\u00e1n     | 36                |\n|                    | Loh\u00e1r       | 40                |\n|                    | Kubh\u00e1r      | 19                |\n| D.\u2014Skilled labour  | Jul\u00e1sha     | 2                 |\n|                    | M\u00e1chhi      | 28                |\n|                    | Teli        | 18                |\n|                    | Dhobi       | 27                |\n|                    | Mochi       | 23                |\n| E.\u2014Unskilled labour, Ch\u00fahhra, Mussalli | | 80 |\n\nIt will be seen that the unskilled labourers have increased more than any other section of the population; but the agriculturists are not far behind: the Sayads, who minister to the souls of the great majority of the population, the Sun\u00e1rs, who minister to their vanity, and the smiths and masons, who supply the most necessary instruments of agriculture have all kept pace with the general rate of increase; the M\u00e1chh\u00eds who prepare the food, and the Darz\u00eds, Dhob\u00eds and Moch\u00eds, who supply, clean and repair raiment, have lost a little ground; the potter is naturally less needed in a world of canals than in one of Persian wheels, and the oil-presser is also being ousted, partly by the improved oil-press, and partly by the European exporter. The weavers afford a rather startling proof of the power of Manchester.\n\nBy far the most important family in the district is the Tiw\u00e1na family of Mitha-Tiw\u00e1na on the edge of the Thal. An account of their early history has already been given in Section B, and a full account will be found in Massy\u2019s \u201cPunjab Leading families\u2014The Tiwanas of Mitha-Tiw\u00e1na.\u201d\nChiefs\u201d Volume II, pages 167-183 (1910 edition)*. The three Maliks who in the last generation did such good service for Government and received the title of Kh\u00e1n Bah\u00e1dur, besides other rewards, viz., Maliks Fateh Sher Kh\u00e1n, Sher Muhammad Kh\u00e1n and S\u00e1hib Kh\u00e1n, C.S.I., have all died. Malik Fateh Sher Kh\u00e1n left a minor son, Muhammad Sher Kh\u00e1n, who was till 1915 under the Court of Wards. He holds a perpetual j\u00e1g\u00edr in four villages (value Rs 5,604) besides a life j\u00e1g\u00edr of Rs. 4,089 for his father's mutiny services. He holds also a lease of State land at Isl\u00e1mabad (in the Thal) close to Gunj\u00edy\u00e1l in addition to his ancestral land.\n\nMalik Sher Muhammad Kh\u00e1n, Kh\u00e1n Bah\u00e1dur, left two minor sons, Dost Muhammad and Ghul\u00e1m Jil\u00e1ni, who were also till 1915 under the Court of Wards. Malik Dost Muhammad holds a perpetual j\u00e1g\u00edr of the value of Rs 8,856, a life j\u00e1g\u00edr in consideration of his father's Mutiny services of Rs. 450, and a j\u00e1g\u00edr for the life of himself and his son of Rs. 750. The brothers own a large area of land in the Khush\u00e1b Thal, and 1,500 acres of land near the Jhelum, part of which is irrigated from the Corbynwah Canal but is not very productive. They are entitled to irrigate their lands from this canal free of water-rates for their life-time. In addition to his lands in Khush\u00e1b, Malik Dost Muhammad Kh\u00e1n has squares on the Lower Jhelum Canal. M. Ghul\u00e1m Jil\u00e1ni, who has recently been accepted for a direct commission in a Sillad\u00e1r Camel Corps, only has a one-third share in the family estates in Khush\u00e1b Tahs\u00edl.\n\nAll these three young representatives of this famous family have yet to win their spurs.\n\nMalik S\u00e1hib Kh\u00e1n, Kh\u00e1n Bah\u00e1dur, C.S.I., after doing excellent service in the Mutiny, obtained a grant of 8,700 acres of waste land at Kalra in the Shahpur Tahs\u00edl and constructed a canal to irrigate it. This has now become a most valuable estate. Malik S\u00e1hib Kh\u00e1n, who had earned a reputation for straightforwardness and integrity, died in 1879, leaving one son\n\n*A different and more far-reaching account is given in an Urdu history of M. Jah\u00e1n Kh\u00e1n of Jah\u00e1nabad, published anonymously under the title \u201cJah\u00e1n Nama.\u201d The author (who unfortunately quotes no authorities) traces the descent of the tribe from Adam, through Ham; this patriarch is supposed to have migrated to Sindh, and his eldest son, Hind, had four sons, of whom the eldest, Purab, had 42 sons, Kishen being his successor. The line is traced down to the time of the Pandas, when R\u00e1ja Jamald was succeeded by Tiw\u00e1na; five generations later comes R\u00e1\u00ed Melo D\u00e1s, who after being defeated by Feroz Shah, King of Delhi, fled to Shakarganj, where he, together with his adherents Si\u00e1la, Kharra\u2019s, Harrals, Kaleras, Dhuddis, Bhattas, Chadharas, &c., was converted to Islam by Hazrat Sheikh Farid-ud-d\u00edn. From Shakarganj R\u00e1\u00ed Melo D\u00e1s went to Hot, R\u00e1\u00ed of Dera Ismail Khan, who gave him Darya Khan in j\u00e1g\u00edr. Of his three sons, Jeth succeeded, and is the progenitor of the existing Tiw\u00e1nas. Lakhu went east and became a Sikh, and W\u00e1nu went to Sindh. One of W\u00e1nu\u2019s sons went to R\u00e1walpindi, and there begat the founder of the Gheba clan. Rahd\u00e1ri was the village first visited by the Tiw\u00e1nas in this district, and from there they spread northward and eastward to Ukhli Mohla and Mitha-Tiw\u00e1na.\nMalik Umar Hay\u00e1t Kh\u00e1n, who was brought up under the Court of Wards and educated at the Aitchison Chiefs' College in Lahore, where he gained a good colloquial knowledge of English. In 1895 he was, on coming of age, put in charge of his splendid property, the income of which is well over a lakh of rupees per annum, besides large accumulated and invested savings. In addition to his inherited estates\u2014K\u00e1lra and Megha Kadhi in Shahpur, and some land in Khush\u00e1b\u2014Malik Umar Hay\u00e1t has purchased Sard\u00e1rpur and Chak Umar, as well as other land in Shahpur and Bhera. He owns three inundation canals\u2014the P\u00edr\u00e1nw\u00e1la, the Chah\u00e1rami, and the S\u00e1hib Kh\u00e1n W\u00e1la\u2014which add greatly to his wealth and prestige. He has also squares in the Lower Chen\u00e1b and Lower Jhelum Colonies; in the latter he maintains a large stud-farm. He has long been an Honorary Magistrate and exercises 1st class powers; he was for a time Vice-Chairman of the District Board. He is an Honorary Captain in the XVIIIth King George's Own Tiw\u00e1na Lancers, and has seen active service in Somaliland (as Assistant Commandant of the 54th Camel Corps, 1903), Tibet (1904), France (1914-15), and Mesopotamia (1916); on the first occasion he got the medal and clasp and was mentioned in despatches; in Tibet he got the medal; in France, where he served on the staff of the Cavalry Brigade, he was three times mentioned in despatches. He was made a Companion of the Indian Empire for his military services in 1906, a Member of the Victoria Order in 1911, on account of his share in the Delhi Darb\u00e1r, where he was Deputy Herald, and a Knight-Commander of the Indian Empire in 1916 for his services with the Expeditionary Forces. He has served on the Legislative Councils of His Honour the Lieutenant-Governor and His Excellency the Governor-General, being nominated for the latter body a second time in 1913. In general, it may be claimed that the Malik's record of service is as varied and meritorious as that of any landowner in the province and, as he is still in Mesopotamia, there is reason to hope that he may again add to his laurels. He enjoys a life j\u00e1g\u00edr of one-quarter of the revenue of Megha (worth nearly Rs. 700).\n\nMalik Fateh Kh\u00e1n, known as Moti\u00e1nw\u00e1la (\"The Man of Pearls\"), who died so bravely at Dal\u00edpgarh, left four sons besides Kh\u00e1n Bah\u00e1dur Malik Fateh Sher Kh\u00e1n. Of these Maliks, Alam Sher Kh\u00e1n and Sult\u00e1n Kh\u00e1n have no descendants living; Malik Sher Bah\u00e1dur, who held the post of Muns\u00edff, is now dead and two of his sons, the eldest of whom Malik Kh\u00e1n Mohammad of Sherpur has a seat in Darb\u00e1r, enjoys a perpetual j\u00e1g\u00edr of about Rs. 1,600. Malik Ahmad Kh\u00e1n is also dead; his son, M. Malik Kh\u00e1n, has a seat in Darb\u00e1r and a perpetual j\u00e1g\u00edr of about Rs. 2,500.\nIn the other main branch of this family, viz., the descendants of Malik Ahmad Y\u00e1r Kh\u00e1n, to which Malik Sher Muhammad Kh\u00e1n and S\u00e1hib Kh\u00e1n belonged, were Maliks Jah\u00e1n Kh\u00e1n and Fateh Kh\u00e1n, brothers of Malik S\u00e1hib Kh\u00e1n. Malik Jah\u00e1n Kh\u00e1n served as K\u00e1rd\u00e1r under Dew\u00e1n S\u00e1wan Mal, did good service in the Mult\u00e1n campaign and in the Mutiny, and received a Mutiny pension. His grandsons, Maliks Muhammad Hay\u00e1t Kh\u00e1n and Sher Muhammad own, by purchase from Government, 511 acres of valuable land at Kot Muhammad Khan, south of Shahpur, and the former has a seat in Darb\u00e1r. Their father, Kh\u00e1n Bah\u00e1dur Malik Muhammad Kh\u00e1n, did good service as Honorary Magistrate and Munsiff and Sub-Registrar for the Shahpur Tahs\u00edl. Malik Fateh Kh\u00e1n, the other brother of Malik S\u00e1hib Kh\u00e1n, did good service in the Mutiny, for which he received a grant of land, a life mu\u00e1fi, and ultimately the title of Kh\u00e1n Bah\u00e1dur. His son, Malik Muzaffar Kh\u00e1n, has a seat in Darb\u00e1r and owns about a thousand acres of valuable land at Muzaffarabad, near Shahpur Civil Station, as well as 30 squares in the Lower Jhelum and 10 in the Lower Chenab Colony: he has a stud-farm in the former. He was at one time Jamad\u00e1r in the Guides Cavalry and promised to make a good officer, but resigned his commission to attend to his father's property at home. He is Vice-Chairman of the District Board and Sub-Registrar for Shahpur Tahs\u00edl and is as much respected for his abilities as he is popular.\n\nSeveral other members of this Mitha Tiw\u00e1na family have attained to good positions in the Army and Police, the Tiw\u00e1nas being considered among the best of the Cavalry soldiers in the Native Army. Specially deserving of mention are Kh\u00e1n S\u00e1hib Ressald\u00e1r-Major Sikandar Kh\u00e1n, and the sons of Ghul\u00e1m Muhammad Kh\u00e1n, of whom Amir Kh\u00e1n became an Inspector of Police, Ahmad Kh\u00e1n a Subedar-Major, and Dost Muhammad Kh\u00e1n a Rissald\u00e1r.\n\nAnother branch of the Tiw\u00e1na clan derives its origin from Hamoka on the right bank of the Jhelum, south of Khush\u00e1b. An account of it will be found in Massy's \"Punjab Chiefs,\" Volume II, page 308. Malik Sult\u00e1n Mahm\u00fad Kh\u00e1n did good service under Edwardes at the siege of Mult\u00e1n, and again made himself most useful during the Mutiny. He was for years Inspector of Police in Shahpur District and won universal commendation for the impartial and trustworthy manner in which he performed his duties. His only son Malik Khuda Bakhsh Kh\u00e1n was brought up under the Court of Wards and is now a first grade Extra Judicial Assistant Commissioner. He was from 1903 to 1907 British Envoy\nin K\u00e1b\u00fal, and for his services there he was made N\u00e1wab S\u00e1hib in 1907, and received from His Majesty the Am\u00edr the title of Izzet Nish\u00e1n. He owns nearly 4,000 acres of land in Shahpur Tahs\u00edl, purchased from Government from time to time, and irrigated from the Sult\u00e1n Mahm\u00fadw\u00e1la Canal, which is his own property, and the Meknanw\u00e1la, in which he has purchased a sixth share: he has also purchased land elsewhere, and owns a considerable area in Hamoka. Besides this he has squares in the Lower Jhelum Colony where he keeps up a stud-farm. His son, Allah Bakhsh Kh\u00e1n, has recently been appointed Extra Assistant Commissioner, and promises to follow in his father's footsteps.\n\nThe Naw\u00e1b S\u00e1hib's first cousin, the late Malik Ghul\u00e1m Muhammad Kh\u00e1n, was Sub-Registrar of Khush\u00e1b Tahs\u00edl for many years.\n\nThe representative of another branch of the family, Malik Kh\u00e1n Muhammad Kh\u00e1n, is z\u00e1ildar of the Hamoka circle, and during his minority his uncle, S\u00e1hib Kh\u00e1n, maintained the reputation of the family.\n\nAn important branch of the Mandy\u00e1l Tiw\u00e1n\u00e1s belongs to Had\u00e1li between Khush\u00e1b and Mitha Tiw\u00e1na. From the earliest times the members of this branch have distinguished themselves as good, law-abiding and loyal subjects of the British Empire and of these the most prominent was the late Sard\u00e1r Bah\u00e1dur Malik Jah\u00e1n Kh\u00e1n, R\u00e1\u00eds of Jah\u00e1nabad. He rendered excellent service in the Mutiny by raising at his own expense a troop of about a hundred horsemen, placing them at the disposal of Government, and leading them with great ability and bravery. He fought in the actions at Jhelum, Ajn\u00e1la and Kalpi as well as in several actions with General Napier in Central India, but was severely wounded while attacking six of the enemy single-handed at Ranade. When the crisis was over Malik Jah\u00e1n Kh\u00e1n was given the title of Sard\u00e1r Bah\u00e1dur for his conspicuous services and was made a Risald\u00e1r-Major of the 18th Bengal Lancers and shortly afterwards was nominated as an Aide-de-Camp to the Commander-in-Chief. He died in 1893. His eldest son Malik Muhammad Mub\u00e1riz Kh\u00e1n joined the 9th Bengal Lancers (now known as 9th Hodson's Horse) in 1885 and supplied his own troop, paying Rs. 15,000 as the subscription of his men from his own pocket. He retired as a Risald\u00e1r in 1891 on an invalid pension, but he has always kept his troop at full strength by supplying all the recruits required and has also paid their subscriptions. He was highly thought of while in\nthe regiment, of which he is now an Honorary Captain. He resides at Jah\u00e1nabad near Shahpur, where he and his brother own a very fine property consisting of 3,000 acres free of land revenue for ever as well as 5,000 acres of revenue-paying land in that estate and Allahabad, Vegow\u00e1l and other villages in the immediate neighbourhood, all being irrigable from their private canal, the Jah\u00e1n Kh\u00e1nw\u00e1la. The Malik has greatly added to the family property which is now four times what it was at the time of his father. Besides his lands in the neighbourhood of Shahpur, and his ancestral lands in Had\u00e1li, he has nearly 700 acres in Jhang and other districts. He has a good stud of brood mares at Jah\u00e1nabad.\n\nThe Malik now devotes most of his time to his estate and makes a very good landlord. He was granted the title of Naw\u00e1b in 1915 mainly on account of the leading part he took in founding and endowing the O'Brien Isl\u00e1mia High School at Shahpur. He is the President, Vice-President or a member of almost all public Anjumans and is a trustee of the M. A.-O. College at Al\u00edgarh. He is looked upon as one of the trusted leaders of the Muhammadan community in the Punjab and even outside it. He has, with Government permission, jointly with his brother undertaken the cost of maintaining his own Troop in the Hodson's Horse, since the earliest period of the present war. He is an Honorary za\u00edld\u00e1r for his own territory and also a member of the District Board Shahpur. He was a member of His Honour the Lieutenant-Governor's Legislative Council from 1910\u20141913.\n\nHis younger brother is Malik Muhammad Mumt\u00e1z Kh\u00e1n, who is an Imperial Cadet, and holds at present the rank of Captain. He is fighting in Flanders and has been mentioned in despatches by Field-Marshal Sir John French. Several other members of the family (some of whom have risen to the highest ranks in the Indian Army) are also fighting on the battlefields of Flanders, Egypt and Mesopotamia. Sher Bah\u00e1dur Kh\u00e1n is a Risald\u00e1r-Major and Sard\u00e1r Bah\u00e1dur, and received the Royal Victorian Medal from His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales in 1905.\n\nThe Waddhals of Had\u00e1li, another branch of the Tiw\u00e1na, also deserve mention. One of them, Malik Fateh Kh\u00e1n, Resal-d\u00e1r in the 18th Beng\u00e1l Lancers, was a good old soldier and was allowed to purchase 505 acres of valuable canal irrigated State land south of Shahpur. His three sons have all risen to good positions in the Native Cavalry. The eldest Malik Ahmad Y\u00e1r Kh\u00e1n was Riseld\u00e1r-Major of the 18th King George's\nOwn Tiw\u00e1na Lancers, and was granted honorary rank as Captain, the title of Sard\u00e1r Bah\u00e1dur and the Royal Victorian Medal. The second brother, Ghul\u00e1m Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u00e1n, is also a Rissald\u00e1r-Major, and has the title of Sard\u00e1r Bah\u00e1dur, as well as that of Kh\u00e1n Bah\u00e1dur and the Royal Victorian Medal. He was Aide-de-Camp to General Nixon in Mesopotamia. The third brother, Mu\u1e25ammad Hay\u00e1t Kh\u00e1n, is also a Ris\u00e1lidar-Major, and has the title of Bah\u00e1dur. A more detailed account of the family will be found on pages 190-192 of Massy's \"Punjab Chiefs,\" Volume II.\n\nClosely related to the Tiw\u00e1nas are a family of N\u00fans, with whom the Tiw\u00e1nas intermarry. An account of them will be found at page 195 of Massy's \"Punjab Chiefs,\" Volume II. It was till recently represented by two cousins, Kh\u00e1n Bah\u00e1dur Malik Mu\u1e25ammad H\u00e1kim Kh\u00e1n and Malik Mu\u1e25ammad Hay\u00e1t Kh\u00e1n, both of whom had a seat in Darb\u00e1r. Malik H\u00e1kim Kh\u00e1n did good service in the Mutiny, when he was wounded, and afterwards as T\u00e1hs\u00edld\u00e1r, retiring on pension with a reputation for uprightness and honesty. He purchased from Government a fine estate at and near Kot H\u00e1kim Kh\u00e1n of 2,000 acres, and the property has been further enlarged by the purchase of a considerable area from neighbouring villages. It is all irrigable from the private canal owned jointly by him and his cousin. He developed his estate most successfully, showing himself an enlightened and considerate landlord, a good type of the gentleman of the old school. He was one of the last of the older generation and much respected in the district. He enjoyed a life mudfi for his Mutiny services, but this was resumed at his death in 1911. His uncle, Malik Fateh Kh\u00e1n, N\u00fan, did good service at the siege of Mult\u00e1n under Edwardes, and received a pension. His son Malik Mu\u1e25ammad Hay\u00e1t Kh\u00e1n was educated at the Aitchison College and passed the Entrance Examination of the Punjab University. He holds 3,500 acres of valuable land at N\u00farpur, west of Bhera, irrigated by the private canal owned jointly by his cousin and himself. He is an Extra Assistant Commissioner, with an excellent record.\n\nMalik H\u00e1kim Kh\u00e1n left six sons; the eldest, Malik Sher Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u00e1n, is an Honorary Magistrate and Honorary saild\u00e1r, a keen horse-breeder, and an energetic landlord: his real brother, Malik Fateh Kh\u00e1n, is Inspector of Co-operative Credit Societies for the district: these two have inherited the lands of Kot H\u00e1kim Kh\u00e1n and Sher Mu\u1e25ammad W\u00e1la: the third and fourth sons, Ata Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u00e1n, (who was for a time in the\nCanal Department) and S\u00e1hib Kh\u00e1n, (who is an Extra Assistant Commissioner) are also real brothers and inherited the lands in Fatehabad and Nabi Shah; while the remaining pair of real brothers, Sard\u00e1r Kh\u00e1n (who is an Honorary Magistrate) and Sult\u00e1n Ali Kh\u00e1n inherited Sard\u00e1rpur near Ch\u00e1wa.\n\nAn account of the early history of the Biloch Chiefs of S\u00e1hiw\u00e1l has been given in section B, and a fuller account will be found in Massy\u2019s \u201cPunjab Chiefs,\u201d Volume II, page 134. Sard\u00e1r Langar Kh\u00e1n was succeeded by his eldest son, Muhammad Hay\u00e1t Kh\u00e1n, and he again by his brother, Sard\u00e1r Mub\u00e1r\u00e1k Kh\u00e1n, who died much embarrassed by debt. The present head of the family is Sard\u00e1r Muhammad Chir\u00e1gh Kh\u00e1n,* who was for a time D\u00e1rogha of Canals under the Deputy Commissioner, and is a zaild\u00e1r, a nominated member of the District Board, President of the Municipal Committee, and member of the local bench of Honorary Magistrates, in all of which capacities he has done good work. He and his brother Fateh Kh\u00e1n, and uncle Lashkar Kh\u00e1n, hold a perpetual j\u00e1g\u00edr in five villages of the value of Rs. 3,837, and the two former own a large area of land in Girot, S\u00e1hiw\u00e1l and other estates. The outstanding debts of Sard\u00e1r Mub\u00e1r\u00e1k Kh\u00e1n were paid off by means of a loan from the Kalra estate, but the family are bad managers, and have applied to be taken under the Court of Wards.\n\nAnother family of Biloches held independent sway in Khush\u00e1b until they were swallowed up by Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja Ranj\u00edt Singh, as described in section B. The head of the family is now Sard\u00e1r Bah\u00e1dur Kh\u00e1n, son of Sard\u00e1r Allahjaw\u00e1ya Kh\u00e1n, who holds a life mu\u00e1fi of Rs. 81 and is a zaild\u00e1r and one of the members of local bench of Honorary Magistrates. He has great influence in Khush\u00e1b and its neighbourhood and is President of the Municipal Committee and a useful member of the District Board. His brother Sard\u00e1r Fateh Kh\u00e1n was a Riss\u00e1ldar in the 37th Cavalry, and the latter\u2019s elder son holds a commission in the 53rd Camel Corps, while his younger son is a Ress\u00e1ldar of the 37th Cavalry.\n\nBefore the conquest of Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja Ranj\u00edt Singh the Sayad family of Shahpur held practically independent sway over the town of Shahpur and a tract in its neighbourhood. The descendants of Fateh Shah hold in ancestral shares a perpetual j\u00e1g\u00edr of Rs. 341 in Bunga Ichhr\u00e1l and own about half the area of the Shahpur estate. The present head of the family is Sayad Najaf Shah, who is a zaild\u00e1r and a member of the Notified Area of Shahpur City and the District Board.\n\n*The Sard\u00e1r died in May 1918. His eldest son Sard\u00e1r Abdur Rahm\u00e1n Kh\u00e1n is a Jam\u00e1d\u00e1r of the 16th Lancers, and at present in Mesopotamia.\nAn account of the D\u00edw\u00e1n S\u00e1hni family of Bhera is given in Massy\u2019s \u201cPunjab Chiefs,\u201d Volume II, page 197. Members of the family held good posts under the Sikhs and shared their defeat at Chilli\u00e1nw\u00e1la. They own some 700 acres by inheritance, and have purchased 1,800 acres of valuable State lands near Bhera. The present head of the family is D\u00edw\u00e1n Jaw\u00e1hir Mal who is Honorary Magistrate and Sub-Registrar for the Bhera Tahs\u00edl. He did excellent service for years as manager of the K\u00e1lra Estate under the Court of Wards and was rewarded with a grant of land on the Chenab Canal. He has always been considered intelligent, trustworthy and useful and was made a Diw\u00e1n Bah\u00e1dur in 1898. His brother, Diw\u00e1n Lakhmi D\u00e1s, is a retired Extra Assistant Commissioner as was his cousin D\u00edw\u00e1n Kirpa R\u00e1m.\n\nD\u00edw\u00e1n Ganpat R\u00e1i, who is the representative of the elder branch of the family, is an Honorary Magistrate; his brother, D\u00edw\u00e1n Daulat R\u00e1i, has the title of Diw\u00e1n Bah\u00e1dur and has recently been elected a member of His Honour the Lieutenant-Governor's Legislative Council, representing the municipalities of the R\u00e1walpindi Division, in which he is one of the best known criminal lawyers.\n\nSard\u00e1r Gi\u00e1n Singh, son of Sard\u00e1r Attar Singh Lamba, of Kila Attar Singh in the Gujr\u00e1t District (\u201cPunjab Chiefs,\u201d Volume II, page 145) has no connection with this district except that he holds in perpetual j\u00e1g\u00edr the estate of Naushahra in the Salt Range, value Rs. 5,082.\n\nIt is characteristic of the Aw\u00e1ns, who are both democratic and mutually jealous, that none of them should be generally recognized as socially outstanding. Perhaps the best known are (a) the descendants of Malik Allahy\u00e1r Kh\u00e1n, of Uchh\u00e1li, one of whom, Malik Karam Il\u00e1hi, is a very hard-working zaild\u00e1r; (b) the descendants of Malik Muqarrab Kh\u00e1n, of Kufri, of whom Ahmad Kh\u00e1n is zaild\u00e1r, Sajawal Kh\u00e1n is a retired Rissald\u00e1r of the 58th Camel Corps and a \u201cBah\u00e1dur\u201d (Order of British India, 2nd class), and Buland Kh\u00e1n has recently been given the title of Kh\u00e1n S\u00e9h\u00edb for distinguished service in the matter of recruiting; (c) the descendants of Malik Munda, of whom Muzaffar Kh\u00e1n is zaild\u00e1r of Khabakki, and Sarfar\u00e1z Kh\u00e1n, a noted tent-pegger, is zaild\u00e1r of Jaba; (d) the Maliks of Kund, of whom Sultan Ahmad, zaild\u00e1r, is the present representative; and (e) Fateh Khan, of Kandan, near the boat-bridge, who performed usefully at the time of the Mutiny, and enjoys an in\u00e1m.\n\n* Died on 6th September 1916.\nApart from the holders of 'squares,' many of whom are members of distinguished families, there are a number of gentlemen of note from other districts, who have held land from Government in this district for many years. Naw\u00e1b Ata Muhammad Kh\u00e1n, Kh\u00e1qw\u00e1n\u00ed, of Dera Ismail Khan, formerly British Agent at K\u00e1b\u00fal, was granted 2,000 acres in proprietary right, and over 3,000 acres on lease, at, or near, Naw\u00e1bpur. He associated his brother, Sard\u00e1r Ghul\u00e1m Muhammad Kh\u00e1n, with himself, and their descendants have now succeeded to the estate, which consists of the villages of Isl\u00e1mpur and Naw\u00e1bpur, and a half share in the Mekn\u00e1nw\u00e1la Canal. The Sard\u00e1r's descendants have purchased their share of the leased area, but the Naw\u00e1b's descendants are still lessees. The son of Sard\u00e1r T\u00e1ra Singh, of R\u00e1walpindi, who accompanied Sir Douglas Forsyth's Mission to Y\u00e1rkand, owns about 1,000 acres of irrigated land at T\u00e1rasinghw\u00e1la, near Bhera. Kh\u00e1n Abdur Rahm\u00e1n Kh\u00e1n and Muhammad Naw\u00e1z Kh\u00e1n, Isa Khels of the Mi\u00e1nw\u00e1li District, have purchased a valuable property of 4,475 acres at Jalp\u00e1na, in the Shahpur Tahsil, irrigated by their private canal. Honorary-Captain Ris\u00e1ld\u00e1r-Major Muhammad Am\u00edn Kh\u00e1n, son of Sard\u00e1r Bah\u00e1dur Ris\u00e1ld\u00e1r Muhamad Salim Kh\u00e1n, of Pesh\u00e1war, holds grants of good land south of Shahpur, at Sal\u00edmabad and Am\u00ednabad, for meritorious military services. A family of Shahz\u00e1f\u00e1s, grandsons of Shah Shuja of K\u00e1b\u00fal, hold on lease a grant of 1,200 acres of irrigated land at Shahz\u00e1dpur near Shahpur. Similar grants are owned by the descendants of Subed\u00e1r-Major P\u00edr Shah, Ris\u00e1ld\u00e1r Hari Singh and Ris\u00e1ld\u00e1r Sher Singh.\n\nThe rule of primogeniture has been declared by notification under Act IV of 1900 to exist in respect of the j\u00e1g\u00edrs of (1) Sard\u00e1rs Muhammad Char\u00e1gh Kh\u00e1n, Fateh Kh\u00e1n, and Lashkar Kh\u00e1n, Baloches of S\u00e1hiw\u00e1l; (2) Malik Kh\u00e1n Muhammad Kh\u00e1n, son of Malik Sher Bah\u00e1dur Kh\u00e1n, Tiw\u00e1na, of Sherpur; and (3) Malik Dost Muhammad Kh\u00e1n, Tiw\u00e1na, of Mitha Tiw\u00e1na. The younger brother of Malik Kh\u00e1n Muhammad Kh\u00e1n has also signified his acceptance of the rule, but a formal notification has not yet been published. Malik Malik Kh\u00e1n of Mitha Tiw\u00e1na has refused to accept the rule for his family, but the eldest son is given a double share. The Lamba family, who hold the j\u00e1g\u00edr of Naushehra, also refuse to recognize the rule. Malik Muhammad Sher, Tiw\u00e1na, has, apparently, not yet expressed any opinion as to his wishes.\n\nAs regards the main religions, the statistics are unusually clear in this district. There can be no doubt as to whether a man is a Musalm\u00e1n or not, for if so, he will be circumcised, will\nrepeat the Kalima, worship in a mosque, and pray towards Makka. There is more doubt as to whether a man has rightly classed himself as a Sikh, and the Sikhs in this district, who number 33,456, may be included for purposes of general comparison among the Hind\u00fas. The number of persons who have been included in the Hindu total, because not distinctly non-Hind\u00fas, is only 4,838, or less than one per cent. of the total population. Of these 119 are Kesdh\u00e1r\u00eds and Sejh\u00eddhar\u00eds who are probably more nearly Sikh than Hindu, and the remainder are impure castes\u2014L\u00e1lbegi (1,689), B\u00e1la Sh\u00e1hi (2,755), and S\u00e1nsi (275).\n\nMr. Wilson anticipated that these low castes would be rapidly converted to Isl\u00e1m, owing to the social disabilities under which they laboured. This has come to pass; at last settlement there were 4,523 members of the Ch\u00fahra, L\u00e1lbegi, B\u00e1la Sh\u00e1hi, and S\u00e1nsi religions; the Ch\u00fahras are now recorded as either L\u00e1lbegi or B\u00e1la Sh\u00e1hi and, although the total number has increased, it must be borne in mind that most of the existing number have come to this district since 1901. These immigrants are being converted with considerable rapidity to Presbyterianism.\n\nThe proportion per cent. of total population returned as belonging to the chief religions at successive censuses is as follows:\n\n| Census of | Percentage of Total Population Returned As |\n|-----------|------------------------------------------|\n|           | Hindu. | Sikh. | Musalm\u00e1n. | Other. | Total |\n| 1855      | ...    | 17\u00b72  | ...       | 82\u00b78   | 100   |\n| 1868      | ...    | 14\u00b75  | 0\u00b79       | 82\u00b78   | 1\u00b78   | 100   |\n| 1881      | ...    | 14\u00b70  | 1\u00b71       | 84\u00b79   | ...   | 100   |\n| 1891      | ...    | 13\u00b74  | 2\u00b70       | 84\u00b76   | ...   | 100   |\n| 1901      | ...    | 13\u00b70  | 2\u00b74       | 84\u00b76   | 1     | 100   |\n| 1911      | ...    | 10\u00b76  | 4\u00b79       | 83\u00b73   | 1\u00b72   | 100   |\n\nThe apparent gain to Sikhism at the expense of Hinduism is of course partly due to the incursion of colonists from the Central Punjab, but is also to a great extent a mere matter of classification, the distinction between the two religions being somewhat fine.\nThe distribution by tahsils is now as follows:\n\n| Religions | Hind\u00fas | Sikhs | Musalm\u00e1ns | Christians |\n|-----------|--------|-------|-----------|------------|\n| Bhera     | 11\u00b73   | 3\u00b78   | 85\u00b71      | 3          |\n| Shahpur   | 11\u00b75   | 4\u00b77   | 88\u00b77      | 1          |\n| Khush\u00e1b   | 7\u00b75    | 3\u00b76   | 88\u00b78      | 1          |\n| Sargodha  | 12\u00b73   | 9\u00b72   | 72\u00b79      | 5\u00b76        |\n\nIn Bhera, Shahpur and Khush\u00e1b the percentage of Musalm\u00e1ns is in each case about 1 higher than it was at settlement, so the decrease in the figures for the district as a whole is entirely due to the advent of Sikh colonists. The increase in the number of Christians is also most marked in the Colony area; it may be remarked that whilst the \"others\" of 1868 would now be classed as Hind\u00fas, the \"others\" of 1911 are practically all Christians.\n\nOf the whole population of the district 83 per cent. are Musalm\u00e1ns, and it may be said that except the money-lending and trading classes (Khatri, Arora, Sun\u00e1r) and the Brahmans, the whole indigenous population profess Isl\u00e1m. Of the Musalm\u00e1ns again 96 per cent. call themselves Sunnis, but probably the great mass of them do not know the difference between Sunni and Shiah. All Musalm\u00e1n males are circumcised, repeat the Kalima, pray in mosques according to the Muhammadan formula with their faces towards Makka, marry by nik\u00e1h and bury their dead, and all look upon Makka and Mad\u00edna as holy places of pilgrimage, though very few in this district have actually seen them. The great mass of the agricultural and menial classes, except in the Salt Range, are very lax in their observances, seldom go through the form of saying prayers, and are ignorant of the tenets and principles of the religion they profess. The Aw\u00e1ns as a rule are much stricter than their neighbours, especially in keeping the fast of Ramz\u00e1n and in saying their prayers at the five prescribed times, viz., nam\u00e1vela, peshi, d\u00edgar, nam\u00e1sha and khufj\u00e1n.\n\nThe Shiah have increased in numbers from 9,580 in 1891 to 20,109 in 1911, but still form only 3\u00bd per cent. of the Musalm\u00e1ns in this district. They are chiefly found in the neighbourhood of Shahpur, S\u00e1hiw\u00e1l, and Girot. They are mostly Sayads, Kureshis and Biloch. Their tenets are those described in Section 283 of Mr. Ibbetson's Census Report, and the chief difference between them and the Sunnis seems to be that they consider Karbala a sacred place as well as Makka and Mad\u00edna, add to the Kalima a clause \"Ali Wali Ullah\" (Ali is the Vicegerent of God), keep their hands at their sides during prayer instead of\ncrossing them in front like the Sunnis, say \"God is great\" five times instead of four at a funeral, and carry out the tazias with lamentation during the first ten days of the Muharram.\n\nThere are 905 Ahmad\u00eds, who are followers of Mirza Ghul\u00e1m Ahmad of K\u00e1di\u00e1n; the Mirza, who died in 1908, claimed to be both the Mahdi and the Messiah promised to Muhammadans and Christians, as well as an Avat\u00e1r of the Hindu deity. The appeal of this religion appears to be, at least partly, therapeutic.\n\nThe sect which is variously known as Wah\u00e1bi, Maw\u00e1hid, Muhammadi, or Ahl-i-Had\u00eds numbers 261 adherents, and is a reforming sect whose attitude is what in England would be called Evangelical.\n\nThe total number of persons classed as Hind\u00fas is 72,695 or 10\u00bd per cent. of the total population, but of these 4,719 belong to aboriginal or low caste religions not properly Hind\u00fas, and the number of true Hind\u00fas, including Kesdh\u00e1ri and Sahjdh\u00e1ri Hind\u00fas is 67,976, or 10 per cent. of the total population. Of these 31,026 are Aroras, 14,583 are Khatr\u00eds, 1,555 Bh\u00e1tia Khatr\u00eds, 6,181 Brahmans, 288 Jog\u00eds, 4,532 Ch\u00fahras, 3,421 Sun\u00e1rs, 2,428 B\u00e1zigars, and 1,529 Cham\u00e1rs. That is to say, the Hind\u00fas of the district are practically all either traders, or addicted to religious or menial service.\n\nThe principal sects as recorded at the last census are\u2014\n\n| Sect          | Number of persons | Percentage of total Hind\u00fas |\n|---------------|-------------------|----------------------------|\n| San\u00e1tan Dharm | 68,790            | 94                         |\n| Arya          | 2,205             | 3                          |\n| R\u00e1md\u00e1sia      | 1,062             | 2                          |\n\nUnder the head of San\u00e1tan Dharm are included every kind of approximately orthodox Hindu, except those who profess to belong to some separate sect. No distinction was made in the case of Vishn Up\u00e1saks, Shiv Up\u00e1saks, and Devi Up\u00e1saks, who numbered 23,418, 3,043, and 1,157 respectively in 1891; and it would also seem that practically all the N\u00e1nak Panthi Hind\u00fas, who numbered 12,539 in 1891, are now returned as San\u00e1tan Dharmists or Sahjdh\u00e1ri Sikhs. Some idea of the vagueness with which the Hind\u00fas are classified may be formed by considering that at last settlement only 568 persons claimed to belong to the San\u00e1tan Dharm sect. It is manifestly unprofitable to attempt to define a term capable of such elastic application. The only possible meaning of the term as now used is \"any person professedly Hindu, who is not subsumed under some...\"\ndistinct sect.\" The main distinctions between the principal groups were thus described by Mr. Wilson, but it must be borne in mind that comparatively few Hind\u00fas in this district adhere rigidly to the worship of one God:\n\nThe Vaishnaus, Vishnos, Vishn Up\u00e1saks, or worshippers of Vishnu take their name from the god Vishnu, the preserver of the universe, who is of all the gods of the Hindu Pantheon by far the most worshipped in this district, whether in his own name, or in that of one of his incarnations. His worshippers may be considered as the orthodox Hind\u00fas of this part of the country and probably most of those who returned themselves as of no sect at all are really worshippers of Vishnu. The holy places of the Vaishnaus are those of the great body of Hind\u00fas throughout India, viz., Jagann\u00e1th, Dw\u00e1rkan\u00e1th, Bindr\u00e1ban, Mathra, Gaya, the Ganges, Hardw\u00e1r, R\u00e1meshar, Pry\u00e1g and K\u00e1shi. Their sacred books are the four Vedas, the Vishnu Pur\u00e1n, the R\u00e1m\u00e1yan, Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1r\u00e1t, Bh\u00e1gwat G\u00edta. The Vaishnaus worship in temples the stone image of Vishnu in human shape (many of them also worshipping images of Shiv and Th\u00e1kur), and the strict among them eat only food cooked by themselves, abstain from eating flesh, onions and garlic or drinking spirits, and revere the Brahman and the cow, but many Vaishnaus in this district are by no means strict in such matters. They wear the sacred thread (janju) and scalp-lock (b\u00f3di), marry by the form of walking round the sacred fire and burn their dead, throwing the ashes into a river, and sending a small portion of them to be thrown into the Ganges. The Vaishnaus are chiefly Aror\u00e1s, Khatr\u00eds and Brahmans, and are mostly found in the Shahpur and Khush\u00e1b Tahsils. The sect is said to be decreasing in numbers and importance.\n\nThe Shiv Up\u00e1saks (3,043, found in all three tahsils) are the worshippers of the god Shiv, and are also called Shivi or Shiv Panthi. They are chiefly Khatr\u00eds and Brahmans, and worship the god Shiv under the form of a stone pillar or ling in the pillar-like temple built for it, called shiv\u00e1l\u00e1, by offering water, flowers and leaves, ringing bells and singing hymns. They use rosaries (m\u00e1la) of the fruit called rudr\u00e1sh. They eat flesh and drink spirits. Their sacred books are the Shiv Pur\u00e1n and Uttam Pur\u00e1n, and their most sacred place is Ben\u00e1ras (K\u00e1si). Worshippers of Shiv are said to obtain salvation and freedom from the effects of their sins by dying there on the banks of the holy Ganges which is said to flow from Shiv\u2019s matted locks.\n\nThe Devi Up\u00e1saks (1,157, chiefly in the Shahpur and Khush\u00e1b Tahsils), or worshippers of the goddess Devi, are chiefly Sun\u00e1rs, Khatr\u00eds, Jog\u00eds, Sany\u00e1s\u00eds, &c. Their sacred books are the Devi Pur\u00e1n, a part of the M\u00e1rkanda Pur\u00e1n, Chandi P\u00e1th and the Pur\u00e1n Sahassn\u00e1m, and their places of pilgrimage Jow\u00e1lamukhi in K\u00e1ngra, the Bindhya Hills, K\u00e1li Devi, near Calcutta, and Vishno Devi in Kashmir. It is said that the Emperor Akbar endeavoured to extinguish the ever-burning fire of Devi at Jow\u00e1lamukhi, but finding his efforts unavailing, took off his shoes and begged the goddess\u2019 pardon. The worshippers of Devi are divided into two sects:\u2014(1) the Vaishno Devi who abstain from flesh and wine, and (2) the K\u00e1li worshippers who do not. They worship the image of Devi in temples, revere Gaur Brahmans, and pay special attention to sacrifices by fire (hom), keep fast every fortnight and on the Monday break their fast by eating food cooked on the Sunday night and\nlighting a flame worship Devi. They especially keep a fast (Ashtami) half-yearly in Asauj and Chait, at the Asauj fast on the day of the new moon after the completion of the annual commemoration of the dead (sraddha), they sow barley, water it and keep a lamp lighted by it, and then on the eighth day cut it and light a sacrificial fire (hom), breaking their fast next day. This annual fast is called the navrata, and this and the other half-yearly fasts are the special days of pilgrimage, when the worshippers gather at the holy places, sing hymns and make their offerings. The sect is said to be on the decrease.\n\nThe Sanyasis (22, found chiefly in Bhera Tahsil) also especially worship Shiv. They are a sect of devotees recruited from Khatris, Brahmins, &c. They do not marry, but few of them abstain from flesh and spirits. They do not wear the sacred thread or scalp-lock, some wearing the hair long and some shaving the head entirely. They do not burn their dead but bury them or throw them into a river that they may be of use to living creatures. They gather in great numbers at the kumbh melas held every eleven years on the banks of the sacred rivers. They are said to have greatly multiplied in the time of Shankar Achraj who re-established the old religion, but in this district at least are rapidly decreasing.\n\nThe Jogis (60, chiefly in Bhera Tahsil) are another body of religious devotees who especially worship Shiv, Bhairo, and Devi. The Jogis of this neighbourhood derive their origin from Guru Gorakhnath, said to have lived 1,800 years ago, whose chief monastery is now at Tilla, in the Jhelum District, an important offshoot being perched on the top of the isolated Kirana hill in this district, which is said to have been carried there from the Tilla hill by one of Gorakhnath's disciples. The Jogis do not marry, but are recruited from Khatris, Aroras and Brahmins, one common mode being that a childless man promises that if the Jogi can procure him male children he will give him one as a disciple. They do not abstain from flesh and spirits, do not wear the sacred thread and scalp-lock, but wear ropes of black wool, and many of them (hence called kanphate) wear in their ears large rings of coarse glass or wood; those who do not, are called Augar. They bury their dead in a sitting position. Their sacred books are the Veds, the Bhagawad Gita, &c. The sect is said to be decreasing. The monastery of Koh Kirana received large grants of land revenue from the Sikhs in this district, part of which were confirmed in perpetuity by the British Government.\n\nThe Bairagis (29), whose name implies that they have given up the cares and pleasures of the world, are a sect of\ndevotees who do not marry but are recruited from all Hindu castes. In this district, they usually belong to one of two orders, the R\u00e1manandi and the Nim\u00e1nandi. Both orders burn their dead, abstain from flesh and spirits, and altogether follow the orthodox Hindu religion more closely than the Jog\u00eds. The R\u00e1manand\u00eds worship Ramchandr, are followers of R\u00e1manand, study the R\u00e1m\u00e1yan, consider Ajodhya and R\u00e1mu\u00e1th as sacred places of pilgrimage, while the Nim\u00e1nand\u00eds worship Krishn, R\u00e1dha, and Baldeo, are followers of Nim\u00e1nand, study the books about Krishn, and look upon Mathra, Bindr\u00e1ban, and Dwark\u00e1-n\u00e1th as sacred places. They are said to go on pilgrimage to Dw\u00e1rk\u00e1n\u00e1th, and there have the impression of the metal footmarks of Krishn stamped red-hot on their arms as a means of securing salvation from their sins. Both sects hold a great feast on the death of a fellow-devotee and also on the R\u00e1mnaumi at the end of Chait, the incarnation day of Ramchandr, and on the eighth of Bh\u00e1don, the incarnation day of Krishn.\n\nThe Ud\u00e1s\u00eds (21) follow the precepts of B\u00e1ba Siri Chand, son of Guru N\u00e1nak; they wear salmon-coloured clothes, and burn their dead.\n\nThe Aryas (2,205) are found mainly in the large towns, where they have established small societies. The founder of the sect was Day\u00e1nand Surasti, of Guzar\u00e1t, who endeavoured to restore the primitive simplicity of the Hindu religion and to strip it of the superstitious beliefs and ceremonies with which it has become encrusted. The sect comprises all castes of Hind\u00fas, but is chiefly composed of educated men, many of whom have some knowledge of English and Sanskrit. They acknowledge the authority of no sacred book, except the Veds, and especially deny the authority of Pur\u00e1ns; they hold that no reverence should be shown to Brahmans and that there are no sacred places of pilgrimage, and forbid idol-worship and offerings to the dead, holding that there is one true God who is spirit and should be worshipped in spirit only. Their importance is much greater than their mere numbers would give, for they are mostly educated men, many of them in good positions, and as a rule somewhat aggressive in their endeavours to convert their fellows. In the towns they are establishing meeting-houses and schools of their own which have a considerable effect in keeping them together as a body and spreading their tenets.\n\nThey have established a High School at Bhera, which is apparently about on a level with the Government School in the matter of popularity.\nThe R\u00e1md\u00e1s\u00ed (1,062 in all three tahsils) are a sect of N\u00e1nakpanth\u00eds, closely connected with the Dhirmalais, Dhirmal and R\u00e1m D\u00e1s having belonged to the same family. The large village of Chak R\u00e1md\u00e1s belongs to Khatr\u00eds of this family, who are revered as Bh\u00e1\u00eds by a large following, chiefly of Khatris and Aroras. Their tenets, &c., are the same as those of the N\u00e1nakpanth\u00eds.\n\nAmong the minor variants of Hinduism which were noticed by Mr. Wilson and have now probably been included under the San\u00e1tam Dharm may be mentioned the Dhirmalis (mostly Aroras, who follow one Dhirmal, a fak\u00edr of the days of Guru Hargobind), the Gos\u00e1ins, the Sewa Panth\u00eds (mostly Aroras of Shahpur Tahsil, who follow Sewa R\u00e1m, a disciple of Kanhaiya L\u00e1l, one of the personal followers of Guru Teg Bah\u00e1dur; they are usually rope-makers by occupation, and specially devote themselves to attendance on travellers', the L\u00e1lj\u00eds (a sort of Bair\u00e1g\u00ed, whose head-quarters are at Dhi\u00e1npur, in Gurd\u00e1spur District), the M\u00fala Sant\u00eds (who follow a Gaur Brahman of Sul\u00edm\u00e1n, in Chiniot Tahsil, reputed to have spent 12 years worshipping in a hole he had dug), the D\u00e1d\u00fap\u00e1nth\u00eds (who follow a disciple of R\u00e1manand, and are closely allied to the R\u00e1manandi Bair\u00e1g\u00eds), and the Jinda Kaliy\u00e1n-kr-Sewak; these last follow Jinda, a fak\u00edr, and Kaliy\u00e1n, a Brahmin, who were great friends, living at Masan, in the Jhang District, and are said to have been honoured by Guru Gobind Singh. They make a pilgrimage to the tombs of Jinda and Kaliy\u00e1n at Masan at Dasahra time.\n\nOf greater local interest are the Di\u00e1l Bhaw\u00e1npanth\u00eds who are a sect of Vaishnav Hind\u00fas, followers of Di\u00e1l Bhawan, a cloth-seller of Girot in the Khush\u00e1b Tahsil, whose attention was turned to religion by an example of second sight (ilh\u00e1m) by a Path\u00e1n\u00ed with whom he was staying. The head-quarters of the sect are at the R\u00e1msar tank at Girot where a great festival takes place on Bais\u00e1khi every year. His followers are chiefly Aroras and Khatris of Shahpur and the surrounding districts, and their tenets, etc., are those of Vaishnav Hind\u00fas. They are initiated at the R\u00e1msar tank where they are taught special prayers and have their heads shaved. Some wear the sacred thread, others do not.\n\nThere are 208 Kab\u00edrpanth\u00eds in the district who reverence Kab\u00edr, one of the disciples of R\u00e1manand Bair\u00e1g\u00ed; the main feature of Kab\u00edr's teaching appears to have been his insistence on the unity of the Divine, whether He be called R\u00e1m or\nAllah: the best-known fact of his career is his upbringing by weavers, and his adherents are mostly members of that caste.\n\nThe Shams\u00eds, who number 205, are believers in Shah Shams Tabrez, of Mult\u00e1n, and his living representative, the Aga Kh\u00e1n, of Bombay. They are mostly Sun\u00e1rs, and are said to rely on their patron saint for assistance in the gentle art of mixing alloy with the precious metals in such a way as to escape detection.\n\nThe only other Hindu sects found in this district are the Ods (38), who reverence Baksh Gawa and Gh\u00e1zi Mi\u00e1n (two of the Panjpir\u00eda Saints), and observe ordinary Hindu customs, and the reformed sects of the Brahmo Sam\u00e1j (73), Dev Dharm (7) and R\u00e1dha Sw\u00e1mi (14). The Brahmos have a Sam\u00e1j at Bhera; they are monotheists, who insist on the importance of personal righteousness as opposed to liturgical and social orthodoxy. The Dev Sam\u00e1j was originally similar in intention, but has come to regard its founder, Pandit Saty\u00e1nand Agnihotri, as an embodiment of the deity. The R\u00e1dha Sw\u00e1mi sect has evolved from professedly scientific data an esoteric philosophy not unlike that of orthodox Hind\u00faism.\n\nThe total number of Sikhs is 33,456 and these include 16,027 Aroras, 7,006 Jats, 3,936 Khatris, 1,144 Mazhb\u00eds, 1,042 Kh\u00e1lsa Sikhs, 599 R\u00e1jp\u00fats, 501 Bh\u00e1tias, and miscellaneous members of artizan, menial, and priestly castes; less than a third of the total number are engaged in agriculture. The distribution by sects is as follows:\n\n| Sect          | Keshdh\u00e1ri | Sahjdh\u00e1ri | Santam Dharm |\n|---------------|-----------|-----------|--------------|\n| Haz\u00fari        | 1,825     |           |              |\n| N\u00e1nakpanthi   | 126       | 512       | 22           |\n| Sarwaris      | 223       | 13        |              |\n| Unspecified   | 20,879    | 9,729     |              |\n| Others        | 131       | 6         |              |\n| Total         | 23,174    | 10,260    | 22           |\n\nThe Haz\u00fari is not so much a sect as an order, and consists of followers of Guru Gobind Singh who have visited the place of the Guru's demise\u2014Haz\u00far Sahib in Hyderabad, Deccan\u2014and been initiated there. They are supposed to wear only yellow or blue garments, and often refuse to eat food cooked by others.\nThe Sarwari\u00e1s are followers of Sakhi Sarwar, and are distinguished by their insistence on 'hal\u00e1l' instead of jhatka as a means of slaughtering animals, and their observance of Thursday for giving of alms.\n\nOf the Hind\u00fas only 49, and of the Sikhs 660, have returned themselves as belonging to the N\u00e1nakpanthi sect, i.e., as followers of B\u00e1ba N\u00e1nak, the first Sikh Guru. (With these may be taken the 119 returned as Hindu Sikhs.) There is no clear distinction between these two classes, nor indeed is the distinction between N\u00e1nakpanth\u00eds and orthodox Hind\u00fas on the one hand or Sahjdh\u00e1ri Sikhs on the other, at all clear. The fact is that the Aroras and Khatris of this neighbourhood are as a rule very lax in their religious ceremonies and doctrines and have been very much influenced by the liberal teachings of Guru N\u00e1nak and his followers. Those who are most under the influence of the Brahmans and most particular about carrying out the ceremonial observances of the Pur\u00e1ns, call themselves Vaishnau Hind\u00fas. Those who have been most influenced by the teaching of the Sikh Gur\u00fas and of their sacred book the Granth, and especially those who have adopted the Sikh religion as taught by Guru Gobind Singh, call themselves pure Sikhs. Other again while they revere the Granth yet revere Brahmans also, worship idols now and then, do not abstain from tobacco and shave their heads. Some of these call themselves N\u00e1nakpanthi Sikhs and others N\u00e1nakpanthi Hind\u00fas, so that there is no clear line of distinction between them. Thus N\u00e1nakpanthi in this district means little more than a lax Hindu.\n\nIt is interesting to note that in 1891 there were no less than 12,539 Hind\u00fas and 9,016* Sikhs returned as N\u00e1nakpanth\u00eds as well as 405 Hindu Sikhs. It is clear that even those who followed most of the teaching of Guru Gobind Singh were content at that time to ascribe their main allegiance to the first Guru. Now that the distinction between the various degrees of Sikhism has come to have some political and ecclesiastical importance, a large number of the Sikhs have definitely ranged themselves on the side of the sect furthest removed from Hind\u00faism.\n\nThe L\u00e1l Beg\u00eds (1,689) and B\u00e1la Sh\u00e1his (2,755) are probably all Ch\u00fahra by caste. They together make up 7 per cent. of the Ch\u00fahra caste. The great mass of the Ch\u00fahras in this district belong to the Musalman religion, are called Musallis, and do not eat animals that have died a natural death. These Musalm\u00e1n Ch\u00fahras are treated as true Musalm\u00e1ns by the peasant popu-\n\n---\n\n*i.e., 92 per cent. of the total number of Sikhs.\nlation who do not refuse to eat food or drink water from their hands. But a considerable number (4,962) of the caste have not been circumcised, and do eat carrion. They are still called Ch\u00fahra, and have their own primitive religion, which consists in making simple offerings at a small shrine over which is set a flag consisting of a rag on a pole. They consider L\u00e1l Beg and B\u00e1la Sh\u00e1h as Gur\u00fas and do them honour, many of them describing themselves as belonging to their sects. L\u00e1l Beg is said to have lived in the Gujr\u00e1nw\u00e1la District. B\u00e1la Sh\u00e1h or B\u00e1lm\u00edk appears to be either the Rahman author of the R\u00e1mayana, or a sweeper who was converted from the practice of highway robbery to preaching religion among his caste-fellows or possibly a confusion of these two personalities. It will be seen in a later paragraph that many Ch\u00fahras have embraced Christianity.\n\nThe S\u00e1ns\u00eds by tribe are 673 in number, and the S\u00e1ns\u00eds by religion are 275; apparently 367 S\u00e1ns\u00eds have returned themselves as Sh\u00e1f\u00eds from an idea that Im\u00e1m Sh\u00e1fi authorised the eating of animals considered unclean by the orthodox Musalm\u00e1ns. They have a primitive religion of their own, not unlike that of the Ch\u00fahra, but their ideas have been largely affected by the prevalence of Isl\u00e1m.\n\nEvery village has its mosque distinguished by its three pinnacles, sometimes a mere kachcha building little better than the mud-built huts of the peasants, but generally more pretentious with at least some carved wood on its front, a slightly raised platform covered with the sweet-scented khavi grass, an arrangement for heating water for the ablution before prayers and a wall round the sacred enclosure. In villages of older standing, the mosque is often a masonry building with dome and minarets ornamented with painted scroll-work and some verses of the Kur\u00e1n. The most imposing mosque in the district is that at Ilhera, said to have been built by Sher Sh\u00e1h, King of Delhi, in A. H. 947. In those villages in which several Hindus or Sikhs have settled there may often be seen a small th\u00e1kurd\u00e1v\u00e1ra, shivd\u00e1la, or dharms\u00e1la, but it is only in the large towns that these buildings are of any size or importance.\n\nThe Musalm\u00e1n peasantry generally are by no means bigoted or very particular about the forms of their religion. During an outbreak of cholera it was noticed that many men went to prayers in the mosques, who had hardly ever been inside one before and who did not know the proper genuflexions to make. A man who is attentive to the prescribed religious ceremonies is known as a nam\u00e1zi\u2014a pious man. The number of the pious is however\nincreasing, and the Aw\u00e1ns in particular pay great attention to the prescribed religious services and keep the Ramz\u00e1n fast strictly.\n\nEach mosque has its Im\u00e1m or Ulma, who keeps it in order, teaches the village boys to repeat the Kur\u00e1n by rote and conducts the service at marriages and funerals. Few of them have much learning, or much influence over the people. Greater reverence is shown to holy men or saints (fak\u00edrs and p\u00edrs) and to their tombs (kh\u00e1ng\u00e1h), which are frequently to be seen surrounded by trees and brushwood, as no one dares to cut down a tree or even to carry away the fallen wood from a fak\u00edr's grave; and ploughs and other articles are sometimes left at such a grave for safety, the owner feeling certain that no one would dare to steal in the neighbourhood of a fak\u00edr's tomb. These tombs are sometimes mere earthen graves, but more often a pile of stones or bricks has been erected, with a wall to enclose the grave. When a villager desires anything strongly he makes a vow (manna) to present something at the tomb of some fak\u00edr, one of the most common offerings being a rag (b\u00e9rak) tied to a twig of some tree above the tomb. If the prayer was for a child and has been answered, the happy mother hangs up a toy cradle (pagh\u00fara); if a cow has calved, some milk is presented at the shrine; if a stolen bullock has been recovered, the vow is paid by hanging up a halter. One kh\u00e1ng\u00e1h at Ishar is famous as a place for getting toothache cured. The sufferer comes and throws kauri shells down at the grave, and his pain at once ceases and does not return for as many years as he has presented kaur\u00eds. Mr. Wilson once saw a boy come and seat himself formally at a shrine near which he was encamped and on enquiry found that he had come there to be saved from a periodical fit of ague which was due. He gave him some quinine, and the saint did not fail his worshipper that day. At the highest point of the road from the Salt Range villages to Shahpur, above Kathwai, is a shrine (not a tomb) devoted to Gorra, the ancestor of all the Aw\u00e1ns of these parts. It is usual for an Aw\u00e1n as he passes this place on his way down into the plains to promise that if his journey is successful he will put up a stone to the genius of the place on his return. The trees around are full of such stones, and as it is not the custom for the unsuccessful to knock down any of the stones, the number of the offerings continues to increase and to prove the efficacy of such vows. It is not only dead saints who can confer favours and perform miracles by their holy powers. The Sayads of Pipli Sayad\u00e1n near Girot have the power of curing the bite of a mad dog. A holy man at Sh\u00e1hw\u00e1la near Uttera is known as vatta bhann (stone-\nbreaker) because he can crush stones in his hand; he can also fell trees by a wave of his hand. When a saint has by austerity or miraculous power gained a reputation of this sort, it often descends not only to his tomb but to his sons and grandsons, who are revered as *mi\u00e1ns* or *p\u00edrs* though their own character may be far from saintly. Some of these *p\u00edrs* have a large following who deem it meritorious to make them presents and show them honour, and look upon them in much the same way as the orthodox Hindu looks upon his family Brahman. It is usual for the *p\u00edr* to make tours among his followers (*mur\u00edds*), receive their obeisance, enjoy their hospitality and collect their offerings. Sayads and Kuresh\u00eds enjoy a similar reputation owing to their descent; and among the Sikhs, similar offerings are made to Bed\u00eds and Bh\u00e1\u00eds who come round periodically to collect them. Among the most revered *p\u00edrs* in the district are (1) P\u00edr Sat\u00e1r Shah, Qureshi, of Pail in the Salt Range, a most worthy old man, who remembers conversing with Ranjit Singh, and is at least 120 years old: he is still able to pay or receive a visit without embarrassment, and to take his part in the conversation; his only son is over 60, and his only grandson is just over 1 year old!

Often a particular day is fixed as the most propitious day on which to make the pilgrimage, and on that day a crowd gathers from far and near, both Hindu and Musalm\u00e1n, booths are erected and a sort of \"Holy Fair\" carried on, religion being combined with amusement. There are numerous small gatherings of this description at shrines in different parts of the district, but the most important are those given in the following statement:\n\n| Locality where shrine is situated or fair held | Name of shrine | Date and duration of fair or gathering | Approximate attendance |\n|-----------------------------------------------|---------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------|\n| Kir\u00e1na                                        | Koh Kir\u00e1na    | 15th to 17th Ph\u00e1g\u00e1n                  | 15,000                 |\n| Shahpur                                       | Sh\u00e1h Shams and Sh\u00e1h Muhammad                | 23rd, 24th and 25th of Chet | 12,000                 |\n| Locality where shrine is situated or fair held | Name of shrine | Date and duration of fair or gathering | Approximate attendance |\n|-----------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------|\n| Girot                                         | Di\u00e1l Bh\u00e1wan    | 30th Chet and 1st Bais\u00e1kh              | 8,000                  |\n| Khush\u00e1b                                       | H\u00e1d\u00edk Dew\u00e1n    | 20th Chet                              | 8,000                  |\n| Shekhpur (adjoins Bhera)                      | Sult\u00e1n Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm | Two last Sundays in Chet and two first Sundays in Bais\u00e1kh. | 6,000                  |\n| Haz\u00e1ra (on the bank of the Chenab).           | Sh\u00e1h Sh\u00e1hamdi  | 1st Sunday in Bais\u00e1kh                  | 5,000                  |\n| Turfipur (6 miles south of Bhera).            | P\u00edr Ahd\u00e1m Sult\u00e1n | 13th, 14th, 15th of S\u00e1wan             | 5,000                  |\n| Girot                                         | Muhammad Jam\u00e1li | 20th Ramz\u00e1n                            | 4,000                  |\n| Si\u00e1l Sharif (south of S\u00e1hiw\u00e1l).               | Khw\u00e1ja Shams-ud-D\u00edn | 24th Safar                           | 3,000                  |\n| Nihang (10 miles south of S\u00e1hiw\u00e1l).           | Panj P\u00edr       | 1st M\u00e1gh                               | 3,000                  |\n| P\u00edr Sabz (6 miles south of S\u00e1hiw\u00e1l).          | P\u00edr Sabz       | 2nd Friday of Chet                     | 2,000                  |\n| Nahi Sh\u00e1h (6 miles south-west of Bhera).      | Sl\u00e1h Shah\u00e1bal  | From 15th to 20th H\u00e1r                  | 2,000                  |\n| Bhera                                         | P\u00edr K\u00e1yan\u00e1th   | 15th Ph\u00e1g\u00e1n                            | 1,300                  |\n| Dharama (10 miles south-east of Civil Station). | Sult\u00e1n Habib | From 25th to end of Ramz\u00e1n             | 1,000                  |\n\nThe largest gathering is on the Kir\u00e1na hill; at the Shah Shams fair at Shahpur town at the shrine of the ancestor of the Sayads of Shahpur, numerous booths are erected and tent-pegging, merry-go-rounds, &c., provide amusement for the holiday-makers. The Hindu fair of Di\u00e1l Bh\u00e1wan at Girot is considered an auspicious occasion for a Hindu boy to have his head shaved and to don the sacred thread (*janju*). At the Sult\u00e1n Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm fair at Shekhpur, near Bhera, held on four Sundays in spring, it is the fashion to have oneself bled at the hands of the barbers of Bhera, so that the place becomes like a shambles. This operation, performed at the shrine on these auspicious days, is supposed to protect the patient from all diseases. At a small gathering held in the Muharram at Ch\u00e1wa in the Bhera Tahsil it is usual for Naush\u00e1hi *fak\u00edrs* to have religious verses sung, the effect of which is to throw some of the hearers into a state of religious ecstasy, in\nwhich the patient becomes unconscious or raving. He is then suspended by the heels from a tree till he comes to his senses. But such practices are reprobated by the learned as a work of Satan.\n\nFor the Hind\u00fas Narsingh Phoh\u00e1r at the petrifying spring and cascade in the Katha gorge and the temple at Sakesar are places of pilgrimage and small bands of Hindu pilgrims from the East wend their way by these sacred places to others on the frontier.\n\nOther shrines with a considerable reputation are the Naw\u00e1b S\u00e1hib, In\u00e1yat-Vil\u00e1yet, and B\u00e1dsh\u00e1h S\u00e1hib at Khush\u00e1b; Sh\u00e1h Y\u00fasa\u0331f about 7 miles south of Shahpur; H\u00e1fiz Rahmat Ullah, north-east of the Uchh\u00e1li lake; Sult\u00e1n Mehdi, on the road from Narsingh Phoh\u00e1r to Sodhi; Sult\u00e1n Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm at Amb; Mahm\u00fad Shah\u00edd in the extreme west of the Thal; and Sakhi Mu\u1e25ammad Khush\u00e1l, west of the Khabakki lake.\n\nThe Shahpur rustics are wonderfully free from superstitions, owing possibly to want of imagination. They have little dread of ghosts or goblins, though some places (pakki j\u00e1h) have a reputation for being haunted by demons (jinn) and some diseases are supposed to be caused by the patients being possessed with a devil. There are, however, lucky and unlucky days. On the 3rd, 8th, 13th, 18th, 23rd and 28th of the lunar month (called gaddi) the earth is believed to be asleep and the peasant will not begin to plough, or sink a well, or hold a marriage on one of those days. Tuesday is a lucky day to begin to plough, and Monday (in the hills Saturday) to begin to cut the harvest. It is unlucky to sow or to gather in the grain after the 24th day of the lunar month; and a bride should not go to her father-in-law's on a Sunday. A Musalm\u00e1n will not lie down with his feet towards Makka. When a Persian-wheel at work utters a sound like a shriek (k\u00fak) louder than its usual inharmonious screech, this is considered an omen of ill, and to avert disaster the owner of the well sacrifices a sheep or goat and smears the blood of its neck on the pivots of the well machinery. Other bad omens are for a cock to crow at night, or a hen at any time; for a cow to bellow or a dog to bay. Those who have to travel are careful not to drink just before starting; if a man accosts any one on the road, he will be gratified if the reply be \"J\u00edl\", and depressed if it be \"Voe l\" or \"H\u00e1n l\". To be shouted at from behind is always bad, or to be overtaken by a funeral cort\u00e8ge if one is wearing one's best clothes. An agriculturist dislikes meeting a Brahman. In horses exception is taken to a white star on the\nforehead or white socks (either single, or on the near-fore and off-hind feet), a black roofed mouth, or a lopsided action in raising the tail. A foal born in S\u00e1wan and a calf born in Assu are considered unlucky. A quadruped on the roof is inauspicious. It is common to wear as protection against the evil eye (nazar) an amulet (taw\u00edt) inside which is written a charm, such as a verse from the Qur\u00e1n or a square of figures so arranged as to total up to 15 in each way. This is worn on the arm, round the neck or tied to the end of the pagri. Bullocks, camels and horses are protected by similar amulets. In the Salt Range it is usual to erect a cairn on the spot where a man has been killed, and in some places numerous such cairns of stones mark where villagers were killed in the unsettled times before Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja Ranjit Singh\u2019s strong hand imposed peace on the land.\n\nThe number of Christians in the district rose from 91 in 1901 to 8,616 in 1911: this great increase must be attributed to immigration rather than conversion. The distribution by race, sex and sect is as follows:\n\n| European and allied races | Anglo-Indian | Indian | Total |\n|---------------------------|--------------|--------|-------|\n| Male                      | 82           | 26     | 4,757 | 4,865 |\n| Female                    | 68           | 21     | 3,662 | 3,751 |\n| Presbyterian              | 14           | 4      | 8,007 | 8,025 |\n| Anglican                  | 105          | 37     | 135   | 277   |\n| Other Protestants         | 13           |        | 155   | 168   |\n| Roman Catholic            | 10           | 6      | 122   | 138   |\n| Christian Scientist       | 6            |        |       | 6     |\n| Greek                     | 2            |        |       | 2     |\n\nThe great majority of the Christian population are immigrants from Si\u00e1lkot, of humble extraction. There are no exclusively Christian settlements: but 7,778 Christians are in the Sargodha Tahs\u00edl, as against 787 in Bhera, 38 in Khush\u00e1b, and 13 in Shahpur.\n\nThe Anglican community are ministered to by the Chaplain of Jhelum; there is an Anglican Church, dedicated in the name of St. Andrew, at Shahpur, with seats for 24 persons. The absence of a church at Sargodha is the subject of some Ecclesiastical administration.\ncomment in the district. The American Presbyterian Mission has a church, in charge of the Reverend H. D. Salik at Bhera; but in that tahsil the Mission's influence is exercised less through the church than through the Female Hospital, which is described in Chapter III, Section J. There is another Presbyterian hospital for women at Sargodha, which is also described in Chapter III, and there is a small dispensary at Bhaw\u00e1l managed gratuitously by Mrs. Shahbaz.\n\nThe working of the Mission, as shewn in their report for 1914, is as follows:\n\n| Number of Missionaries | ... 6 |\n|------------------------|-------|\n| Number of Indian Ordained Ministers | ... 10 |\n| Licentiates and students of Theology | ... 4 |\n| Other church workers | ... 13 |\n| Bible women | ... 5 |\n| Colporteurs | ... 1 |\n| Total of workers | ... 39 |\n\n| Organised congregations | 9 |\n|-------------------------|---|\n| Self-supporting congregations | ... 7 |\n| Membership | ... 3,928 |\n| Sunday Schools | ... 10 |\n| Membership | ... 725 |\n| Schools | ... 17 |\n| Membership | ... 528 |\n| Christian teachers | ... 17 |\n| Reading Rooms | ... 2 |\n\nOf the 528 children attending the Christian Schools, 258 are Christian boys and 108 Christian girls. There is a Girls' Boarding School at Sargodha, and a Boys' Boarding School two miles away.\n\nTo the working of the Mission, Indians contributed Rs. 2,792 and Government Rs. 547. The Mission is at present in charge of Dr. Brown. Miss Aldridge has been a Bible-woman at Bhera Hospital for 23 years continuously.\n\nThere is also at Sargodha a Roman Catholic Priest, and a certain number of conversions from Presbyterianism to Romanism are reported.\n\nIn most cases a man's occupation can be inferred from his caste; the work done by each caste has already been explained in this section. Table 17 shows how many males and females actually work at each calling, and how many persons are dependent on them. The classification is of course vague, and probably there is a good deal of overlapping. Naturally pasture and agriculture come easily first in importance, but it is surprising to find that \"Industries of dress and toilet\" and \"Textiles\" come next: in addition to the weavers, the washermen, barbers and cobblers have been included under these heads. Trade is next in importance, and not far behind are the \"Beggars, vagrants, and\nprostitutes,\" which shows that the community is rich enough to maintain a large proportion of parasites. Next comes \"transport by road,\" under which head come those who make their living by the hire of carts, camels, and donkeys. In practically every occupation, one worker supports two dependants.\n\nThe men of the pastoral tribes lead a comparatively lazy life, the demand on their labour being almost limited to drawing water for the cattle and milking the cows; but the men of the agricultural population are more or less employed in some one or other of the operations of husbandry all the year round, and this is especially the case where crops are irrigated from wells. Here in the hot season the peasant's daily life is somewhat as follows:\u2014 He gets up about 2 A.M., gives a feed to his bullocks and goes to sleep again till just before dawn (about 4 A.M.) when he gets up, has a smoke, says his prayers if given that way, and goes off with his bullocks to work his well or plough his fields. If it is his turn to get water from the well he keeps his bullocks at work perhaps all day or all night, till his turn is at an end. If not, he unyokes his bullocks about midday and turns them loose to graze while he himself has a siesta. When the afternoon begins to get cool, he does some light work in the field, weeding, cleaning out his irrigation channels, &c. At sunset, he goes home, ties up his bullocks, milks the cows, gets his supper, has a smoke and a chat with his fellows at the gathering place (d\u0101ra) of the village, and goes to bed at about 10 P.M. At harvest time he labours at cutting and gathering the crops all day long. In the cold weather the peasant gets up about 6-30 A.M. and the day's routine is much the same except that he works all day long, does not take a siesta, and goes earlier to bed, changing his hours of getting up and going to bed as the day shortens or lengthens. The peasant whose cultivation depends on canal irrigation, on river floods or on rain has a somewhat similar routine, except that his labour is not so constant and varies greatly according to the abundance or scarcity of moisture. In rain-irrigated tracts when rain falls every plough is taken out and the fields are alive with men and oxen taking full advantage of the welcome moisture, but when a lengthened drought occurs, the fields are deserted and the peasant finds it difficult to employ his times.\n\nIn some of the most enlightened Colony villages, the daily round has been mapped out in the most methodical way. A trumpet calls the menials to their allotted tasks and a village clock chimes the hours for the opening and closing of water channels. Such exemplary villages are, however, few.\n\nThe peasant's wife can rarely fold her hands in idleness.\nShe gets up before sunrise and grinds the flour for the day's food or, if she has a supply on hand, turns her spinning-wheel. Then she churns the milk of the night before, cleans up the house, cooks the morning meal and takes it out to her husband in the fields. On her return home she does some more spinning until afternoon, when she has to put the vegetables or dal on the fire, knead the flour, make it into cake and prepare it for the supper of the men-folk whose hunger must be satisfied before she herself can eat. If any time is left before going to bed she starts her spinning-wheel again, this being the employment with which the thrifty housewife occupies all her spare moments. One of the duties of the day is to fetch water for the use of the household, and in the drier parts of the district this is often a work of great labour involving as it sometimes does, in the Salt Range and the villages along its foot, the carrying of two or three large jars several miles. As the crops ripen her services are required to watch them and frighten away the birds, and in the Salt Range the women help in weeding the fields, gathering in the crops, and even sometimes in driving the plough.\n\nThe introduction of machinery, however, is tending to lighten the woman's burden of toil. In the cis-Jhelum tahsils practically every village of any size has one or more grinding machines, worked by bullocks or oil-engines, and these now do much of the work formerly done by the hand-mill. In Khush\u00e1b some villages have recently started water-mills and others have had the water-supply brought much nearer to their doors. But the women's opportunities for innocent recreation are so few and their sense of responsibility is so undeveloped that it may well be doubted whether they will derive much real benefit from increased leisure.\n\nThe food of the common people is very simple, consisting, in the hot weather, of cakes of wheaten flour (goga) moistened with butter-milk, for which butter or gur (raw sugar) is sometimes substituted; and in the cold weather, of bajra with the same accompaniments. In the richest part of the district bajra is only eaten for a month or two, but in the hills little wheat is eaten from Maghar to Ph\u00e1gun. In the colony the immigrants from the Central Punjab prefer jou\u00e1ir or maize to bajra. During the hot months the dough, after being kneaded, is taken to the village ovens, kept by a class called Machh\u00eds, who live on the perquisites derived from baking food for the rest of the village community; but in the cold weather every family cooks for itself. The regular meals are taken twice a day, the first between 9 and 10 o'clock in the forenoon, and the other in the evening,\nas soon as it becomes dark, the time varying with the seasons, from 6 to 8 p.m. In addition to these regular meals, in the hot weather, the remains of the previous day's food, with a little butter-milk, is taken to the men working in the field about an hour after sunrise, and parched grain is eaten in the afternoon; with the evening meal either vegetables or dal (lentils) is served according to the season. In the Thal, during the cold weather, water-melons enter largely into the ordinary food of the inhabitants, and the seeds are commonly parched and eaten mixed with other grain. In the colony the consumption of tea is becoming quite usual.\n\nThe everyday dress of the male portion of the Muhammadan population living north of the Jhelum river consists of four garments\u2014a majhla, a kurta or chola, a chadar, and a turban, or pag, as it is here called. The first is a piece of cloth about three yards long and a yard and a half wide, which is tied tightly round the waist, and allowed to hang in loose folds over the lower part of the body. The kurta or chola is a full-cut tunic, with large open sleeves, reaching a little below the waist, buttoned towards the left by Musalmans and towards the right by Hind\u00fas. The chadar is made of three breadths of cloth, in length about as many yards, and is worn something in the manner of a plaid. Of the turban nothing further need be said than that its size depends much on the social position of the wearer, and increases with his importance; a small turban being called patkha and a large one pag. South of the Jhelum the kurta used to be unusual, and in the B\u00e1r was never seen; \"indeed,\" (Mr. Wilson noted) \"the man who would wear such a garment there must be possessed of more than ordinary moral courage to endure the jokes that would certainly be made at his expense.\" Of course, at the present time, fashions in the B\u00e1r are very similar to those to which the colonist has been accustomed in his old home. The material of which this simple clothing is made is the ordinary coarse country cloth, except that along the rivers, especially the Chenab, coloured lungis are often used as majhlas. The Kale\u00e1rs, the chief camel-owners of the Shahpur Tahsil, are also much given to wearing lungis. The dress is completed by the shoes (jutti) or in the hills by sandals (kheri). The Hind\u00fas to a great extent follow the fashions of the Muhammadans among whom they live in regard to the use of the kurta, but their mode of tying the turban is somewhat different, and the dhoti replaces the majhla, the difference between these garments being in the manner of putting them on. The Muhammadan women also wear the majhla (tying it somewhat differently to the men),\nand this is usually a coloured lungi. Their other garments are two, the choli or chola and the bhochhan. The former has short sleeves, and fits closely round the breasts; the choli is short and leaves the waist bare; the chola, which is now more fashionable, comes below the top of the majhla. The bhochhan is a piece of cloth about three yards long and one and a half wide worn as a veil over the head and upper part of the body, from which it falls in graceful folds nearly to the feet behind. The choli is generally made of strips of many-coloured silk, the bhochhan of a coarse, but thin description of country cloth called dhotar, sometimes dyed but more often plain. To this the Thal is an exception, where veils of many colours, the patterns formed by spots disposed in a variety of ways on a dark ground, are the rule. In the hills coloured garments are scarcely ever seen. The Hindu women of the Khatri class in towns and in villages colonized from Sialkot wear full trousers called suthan made of a striped material called susi, the ground of which is usually blue. Over the head is thrown a chadar of coarse cloth, prettily embroidered in many-coloured silks called phulkari, and round the upper part of the body is worn a loose kurta of silk or muslin. The women of the Arora class are clothed like the Khatranis, except that, in place of the trousers, they wear a skirt called a ghagra, and sometimes the majhla. It may be added that it is the invariable rule, even among Muhammadans, that a girl shall wear a kurta and plait the two front tresses of her hair until she is married (chunda). A married woman wears her front hair in two rolls, not plaits, and a widow wears her hair simply smoothed down on her head.\n\nThere are, of course, many departures from these simple types of apparel, especially among the wealthier inhabitants. The highest grades of society frequently wear Jodhpur breeches and sporting coats of non-actinic, or other tailor-cut, cloth; or, perhaps Kashmiri chogas or broad-cloth frock coats with white pajamas. Even ordinary folk affect the military great-coat, and the short, tight-waisted jackets, with balloon sleeves, which were much worn by ladies in England about 1897, seem to have found their way in large numbers into this district. Waistcoats of all possible materials and colours are also much in evidence.\n\nThe ornaments worn by the people are chiefly of silver and are usually of very rough workmanship, though some of them are not inelegant in design. A sheet containing drawings of all the ornaments in general use, with a brief note under each, giving the name by which it is known, will be found with the maps attached to Captain Davies' Settlement Report. It is\nnot usual for men to wear any ornament except a ring (mundri) sometimes with a seal on it, and perhaps an amulet (tawitri) on the neck or arm. A few wear ear-rings, but these are considered effeminate.* The common ornaments worn by women are the anklet (kari), necklet (hassi) with pendant (lari), nose-ring (nath) and other ornaments for the nose, viz., the bulak, which is worn in the partition between the two nostrils, the laung, a dove-shaped ornament stuck through the side of the nostril, and the tila, a smaller ornament similarly worn on the other side of the nose; ornaments for the ears, viz., the vala, a large ear-ring, vali, a small ear-ring, and bundde, ear-ring drops, worn by unmarried girls; ornaments for the forehead, viz., the dauni, a broad ornament worn over the hair, and the tikka, a round jewel worn in the centre of the forehead; ornaments for the arms, viz., the bohatta, an armlet worn just under the shoulder, the tad, a solid armlet worn above the elbow, bracelets (churi) and bangles (kara or kangan), finger-rings either plain (challa), broad (vehr) or ornamented (mundri), and amulets (tawitri) worn round the neck.\n\nThe rules of etiquette are not very well defined, and differ greatly from those in vogue in European countries. Women are not treated with such deference, and are ignored as much as possible out-of-doors. When a husband and wife are walking together, she follows at a respectful distance behind. A woman should not mention the name of her husband or of his agnates older than her by generation. Words denoting connection by marriage have become so commonly used as terms of abuse that they are not often used in their proper sense; and a man generally speaks of his father-in-law (sauhra) as his uncle (chacha). It is shameful for a man to go to his married daughter's house or take anything from her or her relations; on the other hand a son-in-law is an honoured guest in his father-in-law's house. When a married woman goes to visit her mother, it is proper for the women of the family, both on her arrival and departure, to make a great lamentation, and lift up the voice and weep.\n\nWhen friends meet, they join but do not shake hands or each puts out his hand towards the other's knee; or if they are very great friends, they embrace each other, breast to breast, first one side and then the other. If a man meets a holy person (pir) he touches the latter's feet by way of salutation. Should acquaintances pass each other, one says \"Salam alaikum\" (peace\n\n*Pandit Hari Kishen Kaul considers the occasional use of ear-rings by Aw\u00e1n men to be one of several indications of their Hindu origin.\nbe on thee), and the other replies \"Wa alaikum ussalm\" (and on thee be peace). They then enquire after each other's health, the usual question being \"Is it well?\" (khair\u00e9) and the answer \"fairly\" (val) or \"thanks (to God)\" (shukr). When a visitor comes to the house he is saluted with a welcome (\u00e1mi or \u00e1ji \u00e1\u00e9\u00e1) and answers \"blessings be on thee\" (khair hovi). The use of chairs and stools is becoming more common, but it is usual for a peasant when resting either to sit on his heels (athr\u00faha) or to squat on the ground cross-legged (patthalli), or to sit on the ground with his arms round his knees, or with his chadar tied round his waist and knees (goth) to support his back.\n\nSome of their gestures are peculiar, although, as in Europe, a nod of the head means \"yes\" or \"come,\" and a shake of the head means \"denial.\" Thus a backward nod means \"enquiry.\" A click with a toss of the head means \"no\"; jerking the fingers inwards means \"I do not know\"; holding the palm inwards and shaking the hand means \"enquiry\"; holding the palm outwards and shaking the hand is a sign of prohibition; holding up the thumb (thuth) means \"contemptuous refusal\"; wagging the middle finger (dhiri) provokes a person to anger; and holding up the open palm is a great insult. In beckoning a person the hand is held up, palm outwards and the fingers moved downwards and inwards.\n\nThe dwellings of the common people throughout the district consist of one or more rooms called kothas, with a court-yard in front. The court-yard, named vehra, is often common to several houses. The rooms are built ordinarily of clay, gradually piled up in successive layers and then plastered. The roofs are invariably flat, and are used as sleeping places during the hot weather. In the court-yard is generally seen a manger (khurli), and a house in which the cattle are sheltered from the cold in the winter months, which structures (called satth in the B\u00e1r where they are very spacious) consist generally of four walls covered with a thatch. The only exceptions to this general description are the habitations of the people in the Thal and in the hills. The former are sometimes composed of nothing but wood and grass, and the latter are built entirely of boulders cemented together with clay; as, however, walls of this kind have little or no power of resisting rain, the roof is always supported on strong posts driven into the ground, the walls acting merely as a defence against the weather. As a rule the houses of the peasants are built for them by the village carpenter (dhirkh\u00e1n) or potter (kubh\u00e1r), who receive their food while the work is going on, and a present of clothes or money (commonly 3 or 4 rupees and a\nturban when it is finished; payment for work at a fixed rate is only made by Khatris and other non-proprietors. The timber used for roofing is usually *kikar* or *ber* in the plains, and *kau* in the hills, the first two being usually the produce of *zamin-d\u0101rs'* own fields; beams of deod\u00e1r or shisham are only to be seen in the houses of the rich.\n\nThe requirements of a population low in the scale of civilisation are few, and their furniture consists exclusively of necessaries. First there are the receptacles for storing grain of various sizes from the dimensions of a small room to those of a beer barrel; these are made by the women of the houses, of fine clay mixed with chopped straw. The larger kind, called *sak\u0101r*, are square, and hold from forty to fifty maunds; the smaller description (*gehi* or *kalhoti*) are cylindrical in form, and hold but a few maunds. Next are to be seen some spinning wheels (*charkha*), as many as there are women; apparatus for churning milk (*virk*); an instrument for cleaning cotton (*velna*); a number of circular baskets with and without lids, made of reeds (*kh\u0101ri*, *taung*, &c.), in which are kept articles of clothing and odds and ends; trays of reeds (*chhaj*, *chhakor*) used in cleaning grain; a goat-skin water bag (*kuni*) used on journeys, or when employed in the fields at a distance from home; a set of wooden measures for grain (*topa*, *paropi*, &c.); a leather bag (*khallar*) for carrying flour when away from home; a variety of cooking vessels some of iron* and others of a composition resembling bell-metal; a number of earthen pots and pans in which are stored grain, condiments and other articles of food; a coarse iron sieve (*par\u016bn*); a pestle and mortar (*dauri*) in which to pound spices and condiments; and a hand mill (*chakki*) for grinding corn. These, with a few stools (*pihra*, *pihri*), and cots, complete the list of the fittings of a peasant's cottage. In better class houses will often be found bedsteads with well-turned legs of bright-coloured lacquer and chairs of various patterns; wooden chests, often gaudily painted, are used to contain clothes. Utensils of glass, white metal, enamel-ware and aluminium are not uncommon. Illumination is still for the most part obtained from the old fashioned 'chir\u0101gh,' with its cotton wick floating in 't\u0101r\u0101m\u012bra' oil, but the hurricane lantern is to be found in most villages. Bottles and tins of all kinds are never wasted. The kerosine oil tin is put to multifarious uses, of which perhaps the most interesting so far has been the convenient bestowal of the victim of a murder. Everything is neatly arranged in order: space has to be economised and things not in use are disposed on shelves resting upon pegs driven into the walls.\n\n*Si\u0101lkot colonists prefer brass.*\nThe peasant's life, though a somewhat hard one, is by no means wanting in amusements. Among the most interesting occurrences are the domestic ceremonies which will shortly be described, or a visit to one of the fairs mentioned further on. But he has also games which help to pass the time pleasantly.\n\nThe two national games of Shahpur are tent-pegging (chapli) for those who have horses, and pir kaudi for those who have none. The Tiw\u00e1n\u00e1s in the Thal have long been famous for their skill at tent-pegging, but the richer peasants elsewhere have followed their example, and wherever a number of horsemen gather together, they generally get up some tent-pegging, which is watched for hours with the greatest interest by crowds of people. The game, however, which causes most excitement and is most frequently practised is pir kaudi, and when it is announced that several known champions are to try each other's skill at this game, the match gathers crowds of people from far and near, each prepared to cheer on his favourite champion. Sometimes the crowd get so excited on these occasions as to lose their tempers and a free fight ensues.\n\nThe rules of the game are very vague and are not always strictly adhered to, but the general principle is that the players divide into two sides (kothi); one man on one side (bahari) goes out into the open field, and challenges any two on the other side (andari) to come and catch him. Two of his opponents go out to him and manoeuvre round him, but are not allowed to touch him until he has touched one of them. Watching his opportunity the outside player (bahari) smites one of his opponents a blow on the chest and tries to dash away, while they try to seize and hold him. Should he escape, his victory is greeted by shouts of \"m\u00e1r gea\" (he has struck them and got away); while should he be caught and dragged to the ground, his defeat is greeted with cries of \"dh\u00e9 pea\" (he has fallen). Then another challenger comes out to be attacked by another pair of opponents, and so the game goes on.\n\nOf the best players, each man's form is known and the greatest excitement is shown when a well-known champion is opposed by two other good players. As it is usual for the players to move about the ground quickly when manoeuvring round each other, the game is a good test of strength, speed, and agility.\n\nWrestling is not common and is generally confined to professionals; but the village youths vie with one another in raising a heavy weight (bugdar), in working the Indian clubs (mungli), or in jumping. The village boys have numerous games, many of them curiously like games played in Scotland. When\none boy is to be chosen to take a difficult part to be \"it\" in the game\u2014he is selected by show of hands, turned palm up or palm down, the odd man being let off (pug gea) each time until only one is left, who is out (sar gea),\u2014literally \"burnt\"\u2014or sometimes the selection is made by repeating nonsense verses, such as the following:\n\nItkin bitkin lal chha\u1e6dikin loha l\u00e1\u1e6du channan gh\u00e1\u1e6du.\n\nIo r\u00edo chor ch\u00e1kur bhamba t\u00e1ra kirri.\n\nThe boys are counted round, a word to a boy, and the boy to whom the last word comes, escapes (pug gea), and so on till only one boy is left (chhoti) who has to take the unpleasant task of beginning the game. In many games the players are divided into two sides (p\u00e1ssa) which are chosen in much the same way as sides are chosen in Scotland. Two of the best players are appointed captains (vadda \u00e1ri) of the opposite sides, and the other players pair off (rik), each pair of players (beli) coming up to the captains and giving fictitious names, e.g., \"the moon and the star\"; \"the lungi and the khes,\" or \"the kol and the killa\"; the captains then in turn guess one of the pair of names and take the boy whose fictitious name it is. In deciding which side is to have the choice of places, they toss up, sometimes a shoe, guessing whether it will come down right side up (siddhi) or wrong side up (aputhi), or a pot-sherd one side of which has been wetted. The games played are very numerous, and it will suffice to describe one or two. Kaudi is a game in which the great thing is to be able to run as long as possible without drawing breath. The two sides stand on opposite sides of a boundary line (l\u00edka). One player of A side runs into the enemy's ground calling out all the time kaudi-kaudi, or kabaddi-kabaddi, to show that he is not drawing breath, and endeavours to touch one of the B side. If he succeeds in doing this before he has drawn a breath, the boy touched is out (sar gea, literally \"is burned\") and has to sit down out of the game. As soon as the A player has ceased to say kaudi-kaudi, thus showing that he has drawn a fresh breath, any one of the B side may touch him and then he is out. So that it is necessary to keep enough breath not only to run after one of the other side, but to get back across the boundary to one's own side, and dash on fast enough to get away from one of the other side who may pursue. Not more than one player of a side can cross into the enemies' ground at a time; if two do cross, the second is out. When one of the B side is caught, the A player who was first caught can get up and rejoin his\nside, and so on in turn. With reference to this rule a player sometimes utters the challenge, *B\u00e9li di muk\u00e1n\u2014B\u00e9li utthea j\u00e1n* (i.e., I have come) on a visit of sympathy for the loss of a partner, consider that my partner has got up (to rejoin the game). When all of one side are out, the other side has won the game.\n\nIn *kandh-m\u00e1r* the players take sides. Those of one side take their stand back to back in a group, which is called the fort (*kill\u0101*), and round this is drawn at some distance a circle, outside which the players of the other side take their stand. One of the outer side makes a dash at the fort and touches one of the boys in it, and if he can do this and get back outside the line (*malgea*), the boy he has touched is out, but if the boys in the fort can seize and hold him, he is out (*sargea*). In this game also if one of *A* side is caught, he has to sit down and one of the prisoners of the *B* side gets up, and rejoins the game.\n\nIn *ch\u00e1buk-satt* (throw the whip), all the players except one, called the *choti*, sit in a ring with their faces inwards. The *choti* (*C*) is given a knotted cloth with which he walks round the outside of the ring. He drops this whip (*ch\u00e1buk*) secretly behind one of the players (*A*), who as soon as he discovers this must jump up, seize the whip, and run round the ring after *C*, striking him with it till he gets round again to *A*'s place. If *C* gets round to *A* again before *A* discovers that the whip is lying behind him, *C* takes up the whip and beats *A* all round the ring back to *A*'s place again.\n\nIn *tilien te lamba*, the boys divide into two sides, and all of one side mount on the backs of the boys of the other side, who are called their \"horses.\" They stand in a ring and each boy in turn gets down and runs all round the ring calling out continuously:\n\n\"**Gho\u1e5ba meda chamba**\nTilien te lamba.\"\n\nIf he gets round without drawing breath, he can mount his horse again. If not, all the players of his side have to dismount and become \"horses\" for the players of the other side. This rule of one side becoming \"horses\" for the other is a common penalty in games.\n\n*Ulli danda* is very like hockey, being played with a ball of thread (*ulli*) which each side tries to drive with sticks (*danda*) into the other's goal.\n\n*Luk-chhip* is a sort of hide-and-seek.\nThe old men play chaupatt, a game something like backgammon played with dice (kauri); and some play chess (shatranj) in which they often show great skill. The favourite game at cards (t\u0101sh) is one played by three players, using 51 cards (leaving out the deuce of diamonds). It is something like whist, but the cards are dealt round and the play proceeds from left to right, and, in dealing, the cards are taken from the bottom of the pack, not the top. Chaupatt and cards are forbidden for good Musalm\u00e1ns.\n\nThe leading festivals have already been enumerated under the head of the shrines at which they take place. There are also rustic junketings at the time of the horse-fairs in Sargodha and Khush\u00e1b, and the Hind\u00fas observe the ordinary festivals of their religion in the traditional manner. At Mi\u00e1ni, the Diw\u00e1li is a great occasion for gambling, and many come there for this purpose.\n\nThe villagers are generally fond of music, which is supplied them for the most part by the professional bard-musicians (mir\u00e1si) who travel about to wherever their services are needed and assemble in numbers on occasions of marriage and other rejoicings. In their music, drums of various sorts play a prominent part, time well-marked being almost more important than tune to the rustic ear. The commonest drum in use is the dhol, a barrel-shaped instrument; there is a smaller drum of similar shape (dholki); the daph shaped like a large tambourine; the t\u0101sha, a kettledrum with an earthenware frame; the bhehr, or nagh\u00e1ra, a very large kettledrum, made by stretching a bullock-skin over an earthen jar, often carried on camels and hence called shutari, and the rab\u00e1na, a sort of tambourine. Of these the daph, t\u0101sha, and rab\u00e1na are played chiefly by Ch\u00fahr\u00e1s and Musallis, and the dhol by Mir\u00e1sis Pirh\u00e1is. Along with these drums are played different sorts of pipes, such as the sharn\u00e1, a pipe with a wide mouth and a reed mouthpiece, or the b\u00e9nsri, a smaller pipe, often played with some melody by belated rustics on their way home from the fields; or stringed instruments such as the srangi or lute. The airs they play are seldom melodious to a European ear, but the learned among them ascribe them to one or other of the 6 r\u00e1gis or 30 r\u00e1gis of Indian musicians. Most of them are appropriated to certain hours of the day or night and cannot be sung or played nearly so well at other times.\n\nThe villagers, especially in the Thal, are fond of looking on at dancing in which many of them are quite ready to join. Almost all their native dances are of one type\u2014a number of men taking places in a circle round the players and then moving inwards and\noutwards with a rhythmic motion of the feet, keeping time with their arms, turning half-round and back again, and at the same time slowly circling round the musicians. The music gets faster and faster and the dancers gradually work themselves up until the whirling circle of excited shouting dancers forms a striking picture in the blaze of torches lighting up the scene. The most common dance of this kind is called *ghumbar* or *dhris*. Another dance in much the same way but to different time is the *b\u0101gha* in which the dancer alternately beats with his feet and raises his arms; and a similar circular dance called *sammi* is danced by the women.\n\nThe Aroras of N\u00farpur in the Thal have a quite pleasing wand-dance.\n\nAt funerals among the Musalm\u00e1ns the services prescribed in the Kor\u00e1n are followed. The grave is dug with a recess (*s\u00e1mi*) along the western side, in which the body is placed with its face towards Makka and the feet towards the south. Bricks or stones are then placed leaning over the corpse so that no earth may rest on it. Before the burial the Mull\u00e1h recites the burial service (*jan\u00e1iza*), accompanied by the mourners, and after the burial, alms are given to the poor. The Mull\u00e1h gets a copy of the Kor\u00e1n and a rupee or two; he is also feasted, as well as the relatives and friends. On the third day after the funeral the relatives read the *kul* and distribute food to those who come to condole with them.\n\nThe Hind\u00fas and Sikhs burn their dead: the body is cremated on the same day, or on the following morning; cremation during the night is regarded as unpropitious. Ordinarily the house remains in mourning, while the funeral ceremonies are in progress, for 13 or 11 days. On the fourth day after death a bone from each limb is collected and put into a cloth bag and sent off to the Ganges, the same day if possible, in charge of a relative or Brahmin if there be no relative available. If this cannot be done the bones are deposited in the wall of a *dharm\u00e1s\u00e1la* or temple and eventually sent to the Ganges within the year or later as opportunity may offer. The other bones and ashes are generally thrown into a river, canal, or pond. On the return of the messenger from the Ganges the Brahmins are feasted in thanksgiving for his safe return. Among the Sikhs these customs are, however, falling into disuse to some extent. On the cremation day, after returning from the burning ground, they go to the *dharm\u00e1s\u00e1la* and *karah parsh\u00e1d* is distributed to all present.\n\nThere is nothing distinctive about the names of places or individuals in this district. Most of the place names derive from the personal-name or tribe-name of the principal founder.\n(e.g., Jah\u00e1n\u00e1b\u00e1d, Kot Ahmad Kh\u00e1n, Jhammat Ranjh\u00e1nw\u00e1la, Utmam Saidpur) or for some physical characteristic [e.g., Chitta, Jabbi, Khush\u00e1b (a sad misnomer!), or Kalri,) or from some district officer [e.g., Daviesgarh, Wilsonpur, Nikdur (this last name neatly commemorates both the popularity and the modesty of Mr. Rudkin)] or from some relic dug up (e.g., Ukhli Mohla, Hadali), or some characteristic of the inhabitants (e.g., Bhukki, Arekpur). The names of individuals are frequently abbreviated, as is done all the world over: Ghul\u00e1m Muhammad is familiarly addressed as G\u00e1ma, Sharaf D\u00edn becomes Sharfu, and so forth. Titles are much more often assumed by individuals who wish to impress the local officials than they are generally conceded by the community; but the real Tiw\u00e1n\u00e1s and a few of the Aw\u00e1ns are commonly spoken of as Malik; the Janjuas of distinction are addressed as R\u00e1ja; the Biloches as Sard\u00e1r; the Jhammats and Ch\u00e1chars as R\u00e1na. P\u00edr and Mi\u00e1n are reserved for the religious families, Sayyyads, Qureshis, Nagianas, or so-called Mi\u00e1n\u00e1s.\n\nSome idea of the relative importance of the various leading families of the district will be gathered from the List of Divisional and Provincial Darb\u00e1r\u00eds in the Appendix (I. A.).\n\nIn addition to these gentlemen there are a number of others who, by reason of their official position, rank, or title, are entitled to a seat in Darb\u00e1r. Lists of those who have received titles or military distinctions from Government, of retired military officers of commissioned rank, retired civil officers of gazetted rank, and of members of local bodies are also given in the Appendix (I. B.-I. G.).\n\nA list of Honorary Magistrates will be found in Chapter III. Government officials also attend Darb\u00e1r\u00eds in their official capacity, but they are so frequently changed that nothing is gained by adding a list of them.\n\nOn a somewhat lower plane than the Darb\u00e1r\u00eds are those who are entitled to the courtesy of a chair on official occasions. A list of these will also be found in the Appendix (I. H.).\nCHAPTER II\u2014ECONOMIC.\n\nA\u2014Agriculture and Irrigation.\n\nThe mode of cultivation varies with the physical character and irrigation facilities of the different parts of the district, already described in Chapter I. In the recent settlements, assessment circles were, in each tahsil, based upon these variations:\n\n| Tahsil | Assessment circle now adopted | Assessment circle adopted by Mr. Wilson | Corresponding circle of regular settlement | Brief description of present circle |\n|--------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| Bhera  | Chenab                        | Chenab                                 | Hithar                                   | Chenab valley and perennial irrigation. |\n|        | B\u00e1r                           | B\u00e1r                                    | Ut\u00e1r                                     | Perennial irrigation.                |\n|        | Jhelum                        | Jhelum                                 | Nakka                                    | Jhelum valley and inundation canals. |\n| Sargodha| B\u00e1r Uthla                     | B\u00e1r                                    | Ut\u00e1r                                     | Perennial irrigation.                |\n|        | B\u00e1r Hethla                    |                                        |                                          |                                     |\n| Shahpur| Ara                           | Ara                                    | Ut\u00e1r                                     | Perennial irrigation.                |\n|        | Jhelum                        | Jhelum                                 | Nakka                                    | Jhelum valley and inundation canals. |\n|        | Jhelum                        | Jhelum                                 | Hithar                                   | Jhelum valley.                       |\n| Khush\u00e1b| Thal                          | Thal                                   | Thal                                     | Sandy upland.                        |\n|        | Mohar                         | Mohar                                  | Danda                                    | Foot of hills.                       |\n|        | Hill                          | Hill                                   | Hill                                     | Salt Range.                          |\n\nThe B\u00e1r Uthla circle of Sargodha was originally in the B\u00e1r circles of Bhera and Shahpur, and the B\u00e1r Hethla circle was partly in the B\u00e1r circle of Shahpur and partly in Jhang District.\n\nIn the Bhera, Sargodha, and Shahpur Tahsils and in that portion of the Jhelum valley which lies in the Khush\u00e1b Tahsil, the people as a rule recognize no differences of soil except such as are...\nbased on the existence or otherwise of irrigation, and on the capacity which each kind of soil possesses of retaining water for a longer or shorter period. In the riverain, land annually inundated by ordinary floods is called kachcha; higher land subject to inundation by high floods is called bela, a term generally applied to the islands in the river channel; a thin layer of alluvial soil over river-sand is called rappar; a deposit of silt on old land is att, while seu or sailaba is the general term for land subject to inundation from the river. A light sandy soil is called ratdli (i.e., sandy); a more fertile loam with a less admixture of sand is called from its colour ratti (i.e., red); and a still stonier clayey soil is known as dar, or, if it be in a hollow often filled with rain water, dabbar. With sufficient moisture dar is the most productive, but in ordinary seasons ratti gives the best crops. Land impregnated with salts is everywhere known by the name of shor kullar, or kalri. Maira is highlying generally sandy ground on which rain water does not lie; patches of hard barren land off which water flows readily are called vari; both are included in the term thangar, which means highlying land. Bhusri is light sandy loam, while a harder lowlying loam is called rohi. The long narrow depressions which are frequent in the B\u00e1r, and are probably old river channels, are generally known as v\u00e1hal; if very narrow they are called nati; a wide hollow is called chura and a small hollow chol; lowlying ground in which grass grows well is called talla. Rag is the sloping bank of a hollow or depression. Cultivated land is generally called rarhi; if embanked to catch the drainage water off neighbouring higher land it is kar\u00e1hi, karhat or p\u00e1l; if near the village and benefiting from its manure it is ny\u00e1di (a term also applied to patches of cultivation in the B\u00e1r); if irrigated from wells or jhal\u00e1rs it is ch\u00e1hi or \u00e1bi; if irrigated from a canal (n\u00e1la) it is nahri.\n\nIn this tract for assessment purposes the soils have been classed according to means of irrigation as follows:\n\n1. Ch\u00e1hi, including all land irrigated from wells or jhal\u00e1rs, whether assisted by canals or river floods or not.\n2. Nahri, i.e., land ordinarily irrigated by canals.\n3. Sail\u00e1b, i.e., land subject to inundation from the river.\n4. B\u00e1r\u00e1ni, i.e., land dependent on the immediate rainfall only.\n\nIn the Thal the peasants make the following distinctions of soil. L\u00e1hga or paili is the name given to the patches of hard level soil which appear here and there between the sandy\nhillocks, benefit from their scanty drainage and produce excellent gram and fair crops of bajra and moth. The sides and surfaces of the hillocks themselves are sometimes (especially near the villages) slightly scratched and sown with the seeds of the watermelon, and this primitive style of cultivation is known as vari. When uncultivated, the sand-hills are known as tibba or man or collectively as Thal, and the hard patches between are called lak, or, when extensive, patti. In this tract no distinction of soil, or class has been made for assessment purposes.\n\nThe wide barren plain of hard salt-impregnated soil near the base of the hills, known collectively as chhachh, is also called rari and this is sub-divided into jabbari and kallar, according as it absorbs moisture or is impervious to it. A little cultivation is carried on here by means of the rainfall on the field itself and this is known as bindi or barani, but the most usual form of cultivation is by means of long low embankments so constructed as to guide the drainage of the higher barren soil (rari) on to fields lying at a slightly lower level, which then become capable of cultivation, and are known as rarid\u00e1r. The stony land at the base of the hills is called gar or garanda, and the cultivated land further out on to which the water of the hill-torrents is conducted by a system of embankments is called n\u00e1lad\u00e1r, and corresponds to the hail of the hill circle. Still further out the lands which only benefit from plentiful drainage bursting the banks of the nearer fields are known as chhald\u00e1r. Patches of cultivation inside the hills are called chahri. Here for purposes of assessment the soils are classed as (1) n\u00e1lad\u00e1r or lands benefiting from hill-torrents; (2) rarid\u00e1r, or lands receiving drainage from barren tracts lying slightly above them; or (3) barani (the bindi of last settlement) or lands dependent on their own rainfall alone.\n\nThe soil of the valleys, formed by the gradual disintegration of the limestone and sandstone rocks of which the upper surface of the range is chiefly composed, is exceedingly fertile and its powers are being constantly renewed by fresh deposits brought down by the torrents from the surrounding hills, so that there is little need of manure or fallows. It does not vary much in general character throughout the tract, except that in J\u00e1ba and other villages to the north-east, which are bounded on the north by a range of sandstone, instead of the usual lime-stone, the soil is more sandy and less fertile than in the villages to the west. Its productive powers, however, differ greatly in the several villages, and even in the same village, according as the situation of the field places it more or less in the way of intercepting the\nfertilizing deposits brought down by the hill-torrents after rain, or of receiving the drainage from neighbouring higher grounds. It is on this distinction that the peasants base their classification of soils, which has been followed in the recent settlement. Where a torrent debouches from the hills on to comparatively level ground, a strong embankment is thrown across it, not to hold up the water permanently, but to turn it out of its deep natural channel on to the higher-lying culturable land. Should one embankment not be sufficient, another is made lower down to control the surplus water, and so on, until the whole of the water brought down by the torrent, laden with its limestone mud, is poured over the fields on the slopes of the valley. If the torrent is a large one, the embankments are so arranged as to divide the body of the water into several more manageable streams. The fields which receive the first flow have strong and high embankments built round their lower edges so as to retain the water until the field is thoroughly saturated, it is then passed on through an opening made in the embankment to the field below, and so on, in turn, until the whole of the water has percolated into the soil. Thus the slopes of the valleys have been gradually worked into a succession of terraces, one below the other, and in some cases the dams are so strong and so well designed that the natural channel of a large torrent remains perfectly dry and, even after heavy rainfall on its catchment area in the hills, the whole stream is turned on to the ridges on either side, and passing down gradually from terrace to terrace irrigates a large area of comparatively high land, which would naturally remain dry and almost unculturable. Those fields which get the first flow of water are the most favourably situated, for they are sure of irrigation even after a scanty shower. They are generally to be distinguished by the high and strong embankments needed to retain the water sufficiently long after heavy rainfall, and are known as hail. (This term is also applied to land situated immediately below a village-site and benefiting from the drainage of the village, which usually brings down some fertilising manure along with it.) The fields situated farther from the mouth of the gorge, so as to receive only the surplus water of the torrent after the hail has been irrigated, or which receive only the surface drainage from a small area of higherlying land, are classified as maira. Their embankments are generally lower and weaker than those of the hail fields, and their soil looser and lighter. Those fields again which are so situated as to get very little drainage at all, and to be dependent almost entirely on the rain which falls directly on them, are known as rakkar or b\u00e1r\u00e1ni and are often more stony than hail or maira. These are the only\nimportant distinctions of soil recognised by the people and useful for assessment purposes. All land not irrigated from a well or permanent water-course has accordingly been classed as *hail*, *maira* or *l\u00e1r\u00e1ni*. The small area irrigated from wells is classed as *ch\u00e1hi*, and the insignificant area irrigated by small perennial streams is classed as *\u00e1b\u00ed*.\n\nIn the Assessment Reports the classification of soils has been made as simple as possible, and distinguishes only the following varieties:\n\n(a) *Ch\u00e1hi*=all land ordinarily irrigated from a well or from a *jhal\u00e1r* on the bank of a river or inundation canal.\n\n(b) *Ch\u00e1hi-n-hri*=all land irrigated partly by an inundation canal and partly by a well.\n\n(c) *Jhal\u00e1ri*=all land irrigated by a *jhal\u00e1r* on a perennial canal.\n\n(d) *Nahri*=all land irrigated entirely by a canal, whether perennial or inundation.\n\n(e) *\u00c1bi*=all land irrigated from a perennial stream or spring.\n\n(f) *Sail\u00e1b*=all land benefiting by river floods.\n\n(g) *B\u00e1r\u00e1ni I*=all land directly commanded by a torrent or by the flow of water from a hill-side, and sufficiently embanked to retain the moisture: in the Moh\u00e1r circle such land is recorded as 'n\u00e1lad\u00e1r' and in the Hill circle as 'hail.'\n\n(h) *B\u00e1r\u00e1ni II*=all land benefiting by water flowing off higher land, and not included in *B\u00e1r\u00e1ni I*: in the Moh\u00e1r such land is recorded as 'var\u00edd\u00e1r' and in the Hills as 'maira.'\n\n(i) *B\u00e1r\u00e1ni III*=all rain land not included in *B\u00e1r\u00e1ni I* or *II*.\n\n(j) *Banjar*=waste land fit for cultivation; if such land has not been cultivated within the last eight harvests it is recorded as *banjar qad\u00edm*: if it has been uncultivated for more than three and less than eight harvests it is recorded as *banjar jad\u00edd*.\n\n(k) *Ghair mumkin*=all land not available for cultivation; this includes large areas of reserved forest which might be cultivated, if disforested.\nIn the distribution of revenue over holdings, the villagers sometimes recognize other distinctions; e.g., they may distinguish between a *jhal\u00e1r* on the river-bank or on an inundation canal and an ordinary well: they nearly always distinguish between *ch\u00e1hi* land which uses the well as of right, and similar land which only gets the well-water by favour of the well owners (*ariyatan ch\u00e1hi*). In some villages *ch\u00e1hi* is graded according to quality. In the Hill Circle sour land round the margin of the lakes is classed as *kallari* and in the plains the *kallar*-ridden waste is sometimes distinguished from ordinary *banjar*. In the Thal, *l\u00e1gha* and *w\u00e1ri* are differently rated in most villages. These distinctions are all entered in the orders distributing the revenue.\n\nThe present distinctions of agriculture follow closely the circles of the regular settlement. In the Hith\u00e1r circles, river-floods and wells are the principal feature; in the Nakka, perennial or inundation canals assisted by wells; in the Ut\u00e1r, perennial canals alone; in the Thal and Danda, rain water led by shallow drains; and in the Moh\u00e1r and Hill, torrents and rain water, with some wells in the last-named circle.\n\nThe agricultural year may be considered to begin in the month of Vis\u00e1kh (about the middle of April). By that time the inundation canals have generally begun to flow, and the ground has to be prepared for the cotton crop and early supplies of fodder. If rain falls in the unirrigated tracts, the land will be prepared for the *khar\u00edf* millets. If the canals are not flowing satisfactorily and there are no spring showers, these initial operations may have to be deferred till the beginning of the monsoon, which generally occurs between the last week in June and the middle of July. Sowing of *khar\u00edf* millets and pulses is done as far as possible in S\u00e1wan (July-August), and the autumn crop is generally known as S\u00e1vani. But considerable areas may be sown during breaks in the rains, if the original sowings are short and these, known as *pichetra*, are very apt to come to grief owing to an early cessation of the monsoon or of the flow of inundation canals. The *khar\u00edf* harvest is reaped in November and December: the picking of cotton, of course, goes on for a considerable time. The bulk of the spring crop (*rabi* or *h\u00e1ri*) is sown on the rainfall of September, but when the monsoon has come to an end in August every shower before Christmas will be utilized to increase the sown area. Harvesting begins in April, and the crop is not entirely garnered till the end of May. The gram harvest is earlier than the wheat. *Toria* is reaped about Christmas time, and turnips a month or two later. Tobacco and melons are the last crops to mature.\nThe plough (hal) is, with the exception of the coulter (ph\u0101la), made entirely of wood. The ploughshare (kur) is a strong flat piece of wood, generally of kit\u0101r or phul\u0101h, broad at the back and centre but gradually tapering to a point to which the iron coulter (ph\u0101la) is fitted by a staple (kunda). At the centre of the ploughshare is fitted the shaft (hal) which is fastened in its place by a wedge (ag), and is attached to the yoke when ploughing is to be done. Another shaft (killa) is driven into the ploughshare behind the hal and to this is fastened the handle (hatthi) by which the ploughman guides the plough. The yoke (panj\u0101li) has three divisions marked off by bars, the two inner being fixed (g\u0101tra) and the two outer (veln\u0101) being removeable so as to allow the yoke to be passed over the necks of the bullocks. In ploughing a field is generally divided up into sections (thanga), and each section is ploughed in narrowing circles beginning at the outside and ending in the middle. The plough like the Persian-wheel is always turned by the left (sajje pher), and the right-hand bullock (b\u0101hari) should always be stronger than the left-hand one (\u0101n\u0101ri) as he has more turning to do. When the plough-man wants to turn to the left he calls out \u0101hh \u0101hh and touches the quarter of the right-hand bullock; and to turn to the right he calls out t\u0101hh t\u0101hh and touches the left-hand bullock. The depth of a ploughing varies much in different soils. In the sandy fields of the Thal the furrow (or) is a mere scratch, and even in the best of soils it is rarely deeper than six inches. A good farmer will plough his land as often as he can to pulverise the soil and expose it to the air; more especially on land irrigated by a well, which is sometimes ploughed as many as ten or twelve times, while land fertilised by river-silt is generally ploughed only once or twice before sowing.\n\nSowing is most generally done by drill (n\u0101li), the drill being a hollow bamboo with a wide mouth, which is attached to the back of the ploughshare and fed by the ploughman\u2019s hand; but on s\u0101l\u0101b lands it is often done broadcast (chhatta). Generally speaking, the peasants are very careless as to the quality of the seed, being content to sow any old stuff they get from the village shop-keeper; but some of the more intelligent and well-to-do among them keep the best of their grain for seed. A great improvement was made on the Kalra and Ghausnagar estates under the Court of Wards by getting good seed from Amritsar and Jhang. The field after sowing is levelled and pulverised by means of the soh\u0101ga, a heavy log or beam drawn over it by bullocks, the drivers standing on it to make its weight greater.\nEmbankments are made with the help of the kar\u00e1h, a sort of large wooden shovel drawn by bullocks and held by the driver. Beginning at the top of the field the peasant drives his oxen towards the lower part holding down the kar\u00e1h so that it gathers up a quantity of earth. This the bullocks pull down to the lower edge of the field, where the driver lifts the kar\u00e1h up so as to deposit its contents on the embankment (bannh) and carries it back empty behind his bullocks to the higher part of the field. This process both levels the field and raises an embankment at its lower edge to retain the drainage water.\n\nOn lands irrigated from wells, the field is divided for irrigation purposes into small compartments (ki\u00e1ri) by ridges (bannhi) raised by means of the jandra, a large wooden rake worked by two men, one of whom presses it into the soil and pushes the earth up while the other assists him by pulling at a rope attached to the rake. Digging is usually done with an iron mattock (kahi) with a short wooden handle, worked by striking it downwards into the earth and drawing it inwards towards the digger, who thus finds it most convenient to throw the earth behind him. Weeding is done with the ramba, a flat iron spud with a sharp edge and a short handle, used also for cutting grass close to the roots.\n\nReaping is usually done with the d\u00e1tri, a sickle with a curved saw-edged blade. The corn is tied in small sheaves (gaddi) which are thrown on the ground, and afterwards put up into stacks (passa). Grain is threshed (g\u00e1h) by being heaped on the threshing-floor (pir), which is merely a level space of ground beaten hard for the purpose, and trodden out by bullocks. The corn is tossed and turned with a pitch-fork (trangli), and when the grain has been threshed out, it is winnowed by letting it fall from a basket-tray (chhajj) held up by a man, so that the wind blows the chaff away from the grain. The grain is then put up into a heap until all the parties interested can gather to have it divided among them. Stored grain is very liable to be attacked by weevil (ghun) owing to the careless way in which it is kept in mud huts or bins. The broken straw (bhoh) is generally stacked at the threshing floor, the stack (passa) being thatched with straw and protected with a hedge of thorns. In the Salt Range the bhoh stacks are often put up in hexagonal shape, sleeping cots tied together being used to give the stack its shape.\n\nThe number of carts in the district is extraordinarily few, especially considering the suitability of the whole of the cis-Jhelum tract, with its firm soil and good roads, for wheeled\nAccording to the last returns, however, the number seems to be increasing and is now 4,072, of which 2,700 are in Sargodha, and only 76 are in the Khush\u00e1b Tahsil. The class of cart (gadd) in common used is a poor affair, the wheels being often made of block wood, without any spokes, and can only carry a very small quantity of stuff.\n\nThe peasants are very slow to adopt improved methods and implements, but it will appear from a subsequent paragraph that the Sargodha Seed farm is to some extent a centre of progress in these respects.\n\nOver the whole of the plains portion of the district, there is practically no systematic rotation of crops. In the cis-Jhelum tahsils only 20 or 15 per cent. of the cultivated area is left fallow throughout the year, and about 60 per cent. will be under rabi crops and 20 to 25 per cent. under kharif. This means that a large area will be put under wheat year after year with an occasional change to toria followed by cotton, or chari\u2014succeeded after a fallow by cotton and maina. In the Thal the rule is to \u2018sow when you can.\u2019 In the Moh\u00e1r the most secure fields are reserved for rabi crops; when they show signs of exhaustion, they are given a complete rest for some years, if other fallow fields are available elsewhere: otherwise they are given a change to kharif crops for a spell. In the hills it is usual to have large blocks of land under crops and other large blocks fallow. A common rotation is wheat, bajra or jow\u00e1r (after intercultured with mung or tar\u00e1mira), fallow, fallow, wheat, and so on.\n\nManure is applied to chahi land so far as available, and as fuel is generally plentiful in this district, less of the cowdung is consumed as fuel than in the east of the Punjab and more is available as manure. Owing to the trouble of carriage the lands near the village site generally are the best manured; and similarly of the land attached to an outlying well, the fields nearest the well usually get more manure than those at a distance; so that often outlying fields get practically no manure at all, and are consequently left fallow more frequently than those near the well. Fields intended to grow rich crops such as sugarcane or tobacco are plentifully manured. On the canal-lands, manure is generally not forthcoming in large quantities; on the inundation canals and the sail\u00e1b lands the Jhelum silt is an excellent substitute. On the rain lands manure is not used, as it is said to burn up the soil.\nIntensive cultivation is not common in this district, except on the wells worked by Arains, Maliars, Kambohs and other skilful farmers in the neighbourhood of the towns and large villages and in the hills. On such wells vegetables, spices and sugarcane are grown for the market, and two or three crops raised in the year. Mehdi regularly gives two crops a year. On some of the best saildb lands it is possible to grow wheat after maize for two or three years in succession. But the rest of the double-cropping generally consists in the raising of a cheap fodder crop, such as 'maina' in succession to cotton or maize, or else in the interculture of tar\u00e1mira with bajra, which is common in the hills, or of gram with cotton. On the inundation canals, if land has become too water-logged for wheat, the farmer will sometimes try to recoup his loss by growing gram in succession to rice.\n\nWe have already discussed in Chapter I, Section C, the principal tribes engaged in agriculture. Table 17 shews that in 1911 there were 130,042 males and 6,447 females actually engaged in agricultural and pastoral employment, supporting 262,103 dependents. There were 85,388 owners or grantees of land in that year, according to the Land Revenue Report, but this number would not include grown-up proprietors whose fathers were still living. In the Census returns 22,722 persons were recorded as 'rent-receivers,' 328,662 as 'ordinary cultivators,' and 354 as land agents. It is impossible to ascertain the exact number of agricultural labourers, as there are many men who lend a hand at harvest times, and make their living by some other occupation at other seasons, but 29,508 persons were shewn as farm-servants and field labourers. In the canal area with its large holdings and heavy wheat crop there is a keen demand for hired labour in the spring, and large numbers of both sexes flock in from the Sind-Sagar Do\u00e1b and elsewhere, and make a small fortune in a short time. The traditional payment for reapers is the twenty-first sheaf, but as the reaper can make the sheaf as big as he likes he often gets something approaching one-tenth of the crop. In plague years even higher rates have to be paid, but ordinarily the supply of labour is equal to the demand. On the inundation canals and the weakest wells of the riverain, tenants are difficult to obtain and to keep.\n\nThe agricultural population includes the followers of pursuits mentioned in the margin. The majority of the woodmen and graziers are in Khush\u00e1b Tahsil.\nTable 19 shows the areas under each of the main crops.\n\n| Period | District | Bhera | Shahpur | Khushab | Sar-Godha |\n|--------|----------|-------|---------|---------|-----------|\n|        | Cropped | Failed| Cropped| Failed | Cropped | Failed | Cropped | Failed |\n| Average, 1890\u201394 | 525 | 61 | 184 | 19 | 163 | 10 | 178 | 32 |\n| Average, 1895\u201399 | 433 | 125 | 146 | 48 | 156 | 22 | 131 | 56 |\n| Average, 1900\u201304 | 622 | 134 | 227 | 41 | 237 | 28 | 158 | 64 |\n| Average, 1905\u201309 | 1,085 | 172 | 350 | 44 | 235 | 28 | 219 | 63 | 281 | 37 |\n| Average, 1909\u201314 | 1,159 | 124 | 341 | 26 | 219 | 21 | 242 | 47 | 357 | 29 |\n\nand the total areas cropped and failed for each year since 1906. This table shows the quinquennial averages in thousands of acres:\n\nThe outstanding fact is that crops have doubled, and that even in Khush\u00e1b there is a gain of about 50 per cent.\n\nThe quality of the cropping now and at last settlement may be compared by percentages on the total cropped area.\n\n| Wheat | Cotton | Oilseeds | Gram | Bajra | Jowar | Pulses | Barley | Other cereals |\n|-------|--------|----------|------|-------|-------|--------|--------|--------------|\n| Average, 1890\u201394 | ... | 43 | 6 | 4 | 6 | 17 | 6 | 3 | 2 | 10 |\n| Average, 1909\u201314 | ... | 43 | 10 | 8 | 8 | 8 | 2 | 2 | 1 | 18 |\n\nIt will be seen that cotton, oilseeds (especially toria) and gram have gained at the expense of the cheap millets and pulses. Of the other cereals, maize, massar and china are the most important, but a considerable area of oats is grown in Sar-Godha Tahsil.\n\nWheat.\n\nBy far the most important crop is wheat (kanak). It is grown on all classes of land, but greater care is taken in its cultivation on the lands irrigated from wells than on other classes of soil. In such lands ploughings for wheat begin as early as the previous January and go on at convenient seasons throughout the year till seed time, sometimes as many as 12 ploughings being given. On other classes of land ploughing begins in June.\nand goes on till October, the more ploughings the better for the crop. The commonest kind of wheat grown outside the Lower Jhelum area is the soft red bearded variety (rattichihgari or dagar), but sometimes one sees a field of a coarse white wheat known as vadh\u00e1nak, the outturn of which is about a fourth larger than that of the red wheat, and its flour whiter but not so nourishing, while its straw is very inferior. On the canal, the favourite types are ghoni, and \"lal kasar wali;\" the former is a beardless white variety and corresponds to the Lyallpur types 17 and 18; the latter corresponds to type 11, and fetches at least 2 annas per maund more than the other varieties. Only a very little beardless red wheat (rodi ldl) and fine white wheat (d\u00e1\u00fadi) are grown, as they are considered more subject to injury by birds and winds. Generally speaking, the peasants are very careless about the quality of the seed, and it is often sown more or less mixed with barley. Sometimes a little oats (jodra) is sown with the wheat to be gathered before it for fodder.\n\nThe amount of seed used is for good soils generally about a maund an acre, but on poor unirrigated soils as little as 24 sers is sown. On the sail\u00e1b lands about 32 sers and in very good chahi lands as much as 1\u00bd maunds per acre. Wheat sowing begins with the month of Katte (about 15th October) and goes on to about the middle of December, though sometimes, if the season has been a dry one and favourable rain falls in December, sowings may go on into January, but the sooner wheat can be sown after 15th October the better. On unirrigated lands little is done to the wheat after it is sown; it is left to the rains, and the outturn depends very much on whether the winter rains are favourable or not. If the winter is a dry one, large areas fail altogether to produce a crop, and the outturn is generally poor. If rain falls at opportune intervals in January, February and March the outturn, even on unirrigated land, may be very good. On lands irrigated from wells, the amount of irrigation depends on the rainfall, but in dry seasons the wheat crop may be given as many as 15 waterings to ripen it. If the crop promises to be a very strong one, the green wheat is cut (tap) or grazed down to prevent its growing too rapidly. On lands irrigated from wells the tenant is allowed to cut a reasonable amount of green wheat for the well-bullocks which varies according to the dryness of the season, and may in a dry year amount in the villages distant from the river to as much as half the crop. Little attention is paid to rotation of crops, wheat following wheat without a break, especially on lands flooded by the river; in the Salt Range, however, wheat is generally alternated with t\u00e1jra. On sail\u00e1b and inundation canal lands the outturn is much\nreduced by the prevalence of weeds, such as the thistle-like lei, the onion-like bhukhat, or the thorny joah, and little trouble is taken to eradicate them; on other irrigated lands, however, more attention is paid to weeding. The estimated outturn of wheat on lands irrigated from wells is in most circles 10 maunds per acre, but in the Jhelum Circle of Bhera it is 12 maunds, and in the Hill Circle 13 maunds; on land irrigated from inundation canals it is almost everywhere 8 maunds per acre. On the Lower Jhelum Canal it is $10\\frac{1}{2}$ maunds in the Bhera B\u00e1r and Sargodha B\u00e1r Utla, and $8\\frac{1}{2}$ maunds in the Sargodha B\u00e1r Hethla and the Shahpur Ara. On land flooded by the rivers it is 8 maunds on the Jhelum and 7 on the Chenab; and on land dependent on rain it varies from 6 maunds in the B\u00e1r to 2 maunds in the Thal. For the whole district the all-round outturn on all classes of land is about 9 maunds or 12 bushels per acre, and the total annual average yield of wheat for the whole district is 4,500,000 maunds with a money value at $13\\frac{1}{2}$ seers per rupee of Rs. 1,35,00,000, or more than six times the new assessment of the district. The quality of the wheat grown generally improves as one goes further from the river, and that of the Salt Range is famous for its good quality, its freedom from admixture with other grains or dirt, and the greater nutritiousness of its flour. It is valued for export and generally commands two annas per maund more than that of the riverside. Reaping begins in the plains towards the end of April and in the hills about the beginning of May and lasts for about a month.\n\nThe crop next in importance is cotton (v\u00e1r) which occupies 10 per cent. of the total harvest area. Almost every well has from one to three acres of cotton: it is largely grown on canal irrigated land, where about 13 per cent. of the total harvested area is cotton; it is not grown to any great extent in the Khush\u00e1b Tahs\u00edl, except that in very favourable years a good deal is own in the Moh\u00e1r. It is sown in March or April, about 8 or 10 seers of seed (peva) to the acre. The variety of cotton usually sown, known as the indigenous variety (desi) with a yellow flower, gives ordinarily 10 seers of ginned cotton to a maund of unginned; but a foreign variety (vil\u00e1iti) with a red flower, which is fairly popular, gives 13 seers to the maund. The type known as No. 4 F supplied by the seed farm is rapidly gaining ground. On lands irrigated from wells cotton has to be watered a good many times and weeded twice or thrice. Cotton picking (chom) begins in October and goes on to the end of December at intervals of a few days as the pods (doda) ripen and burst; it is generally done by bands of women and\ngirls, who are given about an eighth or a tenth* of the crop for their trouble and may be seen returning in the evening laden with their snow white spoils. The produce of cotton averages 5 or 6 maunds per acre on lands irrigated from wells, 3 or 4 maunds on canal-irrigated lands and from 2 to 4 maunds on unirrigated lands. The wood is cut for fuel, and sometimes the same roots are left to produce two or even three crops (modhi), but more frequently they are stubbed up and the land sown with wheat. The cotton crop is often sold standing at prices averaging about Rs. 30 per acre.\n\nNearly 8 per cent. of the harvested area are under oil-seeds. On the Lower Jhelum Canal this may be generally understood to mean 'toria' and elsewhere 't\u00e1r\u00e1m\u00edra;' a little linseed is grown in the Jhelum valley, especially about Mi\u00e1ni, but on the whole it is not an important crop, and the same may be said of 'sarson' and til. Out of 90,000 acres of oilseeds, 30,000 acres are in Bhera, and 50,500 in Sargodha; only 3,500 acres are grown in Shahpur, of which about 2,500 is 'toria.' The stiff soil of the Ara is not suited to this crop.\n\nToria comes between the khar\u00edf and the rabi, ripening in January: it is an easy crop to grow, and so long as it gets water regularly up to November, it is not subject to any special calamities. It cannot be grown on the inundation canals, but successful experiments have been made with it in the riverain. It is supposed to yield from 4 to 6 maunds an acre.\n\nT\u00e1r\u00e1m\u00edra occupies nearly 6,000 acres in Khush\u00e1b, 5,000 of this being in the Hill Circle, in which this crop represents 11 per cent. of the year's harvest. Here it is commonly sown among the 'b\u00e1jra' or 'jow\u00e1r;' elsewhere it is grown on inferior lands or along the boundaries of fields. The outturn is about 2 maunds to the acre.\n\nGram occupies nearly the same acreage as oil-seeds, viz., not quite 8 per cent. of the matured area. Out of 87,000 acres grown, Bhera and Shahpur have about 15,000 each, Sargodha 8,000, and the remainder (almost 49,000) is in Khush\u00e1b. The discovery that the sandy soil of the Sind S\u00e1g\u00e1r Do\u00e1b was ideal for gram was an event of very considerable importance, and its full significance is not yet apparent. In rabi 1915, 77,000 acres of gram were grown in Khush\u00e1b Tahsil and gram sold at 11 seers to the rupees, at head-quarters. Even supposing that the local market rates were 13 seers, the value of the crop was over\n\n---\n\n* In the colony chakhs the share taken by the pickers varies between one-seventh and one-third.\n16 lakhs of rupees, or six times the new final revenue demand. An average acre of gram is supposed to produce 9 maunds in the Thal and 8 maunds elsewhere. Little gram is grown on the wells but on the inundation canals it does quite well. Wheat and gram are very rarely intersown in this district, but a good deal of gram is sown on the rice-stubble in Bhera.\n\nThe next most important crop is bajra or spiked millet (penicillaria spicata) which occupies nearly 8 per cent. of the total harvested area. It is most important in the Moh\u00e1r where the proportion grown is 33 per cent.; in the Hill Circle too it is grown on 30 per cent. of the area harvested. It is chiefly sown on unirrigated land and the amount of seed is usually about 2 seers per acre, sown broadcast. The land is ploughed from March onwards from two to five times and the seed is sown after good rain in May or June but more often after the monsoon bursts in July. In the Jhelum valley the seed is generally sown in irrigated land in June and the seedlings (paniri) afterwards transplanted. Great trouble is taken to protect the crop from birds. A platform (mannha) is erected in the middle of the field, and on this a woman or boy sits all day long frightening away the birds by slinging (khabani) bits of earth at them or waving rags and clanging pots by means of strings radiating over the field. The reaping begins in October and goes on to December, the ears (sitta) being cut off from time to time as they ripen; and in this season it is common for the people to leave the villages and camp in the fields in whole families, living in the huts (dhok or bhan) erected for the purpose. The average produce of bajra on unirrigated lands is about 6 maunds per acre on embanked lands in the Mohar and Salt Range, 4 maunds in the Jhelum valley, and from 2 to 3 maunds in the poorer lands of the Moh\u00e1r and Thal. On nahri and sail\u00e1b lands its produce is 6 or 7 maunds per acre and on lands irrigated from wells 10 or 12 maunds. The straw (tanda) is not very nutritious and in good years is neglected, though in years of drought it may sell at as much as a rupee per head-load.\n\nJowar, or great millet (sorghum vulgare), which occupies 2 per cent. of the harvested area, is largely grown on lands irrigated from wells, where it is used more as a fodder crop (chari) than grown for grain, and a considerable portion of it is cut green and fed to the bullocks, especially when the monsoon rains are scanty. In the Ara circle, however, it is generally allowed to ripen, and there produces about 7 maunds per acre; elsewhere 6 maunds is a fair crop on lands irrigated from wells, and 4 or 5 maunds on other classes of land.\nMaize is grown to a small extent on wells in the river valleys and on manured lands in the Salt Range. About 10,000 acres are grown on the Lower Jhelum Canal, especially by Si\u00e1lkoti and Jat Sikh grantees. About 18 seers of seed is sown per acre, and the average outturn on irrigated and manured lands is about 12 maunds per acre.\n\nRice is grown chiefly on canal-irrigated and sail\u00e1b lands in the Jhelum valley, and in the Ara circle. Previous to 1888 the cultivation of rice on canal lands was rapidly increasing, but in that year, owing to the great quantity of water consumed in irrigating rice, the canal rate for that crop was raised, and this led to a great contraction of area. The average outturn of unhusked rice is about 10 or 12 maunds per acre.\n\nBarley (jo) occupies 1 per cent. of the harvested area and is grown chiefly on lands irrigated from wells or canals, the average outturn being from 10 to 15 maunds per acre on such lands.\n\nPulses occupy altogether about 2 per cent. of the harvested area. They are generally sown with jow\u00e1r and b\u00e1jra. Moth is largely grown in the Thal where it forms 23 per cent. of the total crop; it is grown on poor land and the produce is about 3 maunds per acre.\n\nMung is grown chiefly in the Salt Range and its outturn is about 4 maunds per acre.\n\nSugarcane (kam\u00e1d) is grown mostly on the canal in Sargodha and Bhera Tahsils, but there is also a certain amount on the wells near the town of Bhera, Shahpur and S\u00e1h\u00edw\u00e1l. In the Chenab valley nearly every well has its two or three patches of cane aggregating from one to two acres per well, but the crop, though very valuable, practically occupies the land for three harvests, and requires so much attention and such careful cultivation and watering that few wells have more than 2 acres. It is a most useful crop. When ready to be pressed it affords employment for a time to a large number of hands and each person engaged in cutting and peeling the canes, in carrying them from the field to the press (velna), in tying them into convenient bundles, in feeding the press, attending to the fire, or stirring the juice, is not only allowed to chew and suck as much raw cane as he likes, but is permitted to carry away a few stalks every day. The leaves and ends of the canes make a useful fodder for cattle. The average produce is about 20 maunds of gur per acre, but much of this goes in payment to the persons employed in extracting the juice. In the Jhelum valley very little cane is\ngrown for the purpose of making sugar, as it is found more profitable to sell it to be sucked raw (ganna). Two varieties are grown,\u2014one the indigenous (desi), and the other the Sah\u00e1ran\u00ed, so called because its seed was brought from Sah\u00e1ranpur some forty years ago. The latter variety is much superior to the indigenous cane, and has now almost superseded it. It is usual to sell the standing crop near the towns to Khatr\u00ed, who retail the stalks in the bazar at a paisa or less per stalk, and near the towns the price paid for cane of this kind is from Rs. 18 to Rs. 30 per kandl and averages about Rs. 200 per acre.\n\nVery little tobacco is grown in this district and smoking is not nearly so general among the people as it is in districts further east. It is discouraged by the pirs of Si\u00e1l Sharif, but is fairly general in the Salt Range.\n\nVegetables occupy 7 per cent. of the total harvested area of the three Jhelum circles and seem to be growing in popularity: probably because they are principally grown on lands irrigated from wells and consumed by the tenants' well bullocks. Towards the end of the cold season they form an important part of the diet of the peasant classes. By far the most common vegetable is turnips, which are generally not thinned out sufficiently and are consequently of small size; but near Jhawari\u00e1n a very good sized turnip is grown. Carrots and radishes are the commonest vegetables after turnips.\n\nThis plant, so often seen in our gardens as an ornamental hedge, is extensively cultivated about Bhera, where it occupies nearly 650 acres, for the sake of the dye extracted from its leaves, which, dried and reduced to powder, form a regular article of commerce. The mode of cultivating it is as follows:\u2014The soil is prepared by repeated ploughings, not less than sixteen, and heavy manuring. Before sowing, the seed is allowed to soak in water for twenty-five days. It is then spread on cloth and allowed to dry partially. The plot of land in which it is proposed to grow the mehdi is then formed into small beds, and some days before sowing these are kept flooded. The seed is scattered on the surface of the water, and with it sinks into the ground. For the first three days after sowing water is given regularly night and morning; after that only once a day. The young plant first shows above ground on the fifteenth day, after which water is only given every other day for a month, when it is supplied at intervals of three days, and this is continued for another month, by which time the plants have become nearly two feet high. They are now fit for transplanting. The mode of conducting this op-\neration is as follows:\u2014The young plant on being taken out of the ground is reduced by nipping off about six inches from the centre shoot. After having been subjected to this treatment, the young plants are singly put into holes previously dug for them at distances of about a foot from each other. They are then watered daily until they have recovered the shock of transplanting, and afterwards as they may require it. The fields are weeded regularly once a month. The first year nothing is taken from the plants, but after that they yield for years, without intermission, a double crop. At each cutting, about nine inches are taken from the top shoots of the plants. The two crops are gathered in Bais\u00e1kh (April and May) and K\u00e1t\u00edk (October and November) of each year. The labourers employed in planting out the mehdi, instead of receiving their wages in money, are liberally fed as long as the operation lasts, and a distribution of sweetmeats takes place when it is over. The season for sowing is during the month of Bais\u00e1kh; that of transplanting, S\u00e1wan (July and August). A year's produce of an acre of well-grown mehdi is 20 maunds of dry leaves, of which about 6 maunds are gathered in the spring, and the rest during the autumn months; and the same plants continue to yield for 20 or 25 years.\n\nThe selling price of the leaves averages a rupee for 9 seers, so that the value of the crops per acre is about Rs. 90. After the first year, the expenses of cultivation do not much exceed those of other crops. The produce of the mehdi grown in this district is nearly all carried across the Jhelum, and sold in the northern districts, especially Pesh\u00e1war; some goes to Delhi, and there is some export to Persia and Arabia. Before the war, Germany also was a customer. The mehdi crop of Bhera is said to be worth about a lakh of rupees a year. Besides the use to which the leaves are ordinarily put, viz., as a dye for the hair, hands, &c., they are also given to goats and sheep, when attacked by itch.\n\nIn the Thal, in favourable years, water melons are very largely grown on the sandhills round the villages and hamlets. The seed is often simply scattered over the sand, and the rain and sun do the rest. When the season is good the melons are produced in great quantities and of a large size. They are known as kalakh, titak, ror, or pitta, according to the different stages of their growth. A camel-load sells in N\u00farpur for four annas, and in Khush\u00e1b for a rupee or one rupee four annas. Muhabpur grows a superior quality which fetch as much as an anna each in Girot. In the villages any one is welcome to eat as many melons as he likes, provided he does not take away the seed.\nwhich sells at 24 seers per rupee. The seeds are ground, sifted, mixed with flour and made into cakes, which are largely eaten by the people. Melon seeds are also exported to Lahore and Amritsar, where their kernels are sold by native druggists at $1\\frac{1}{2}$ seers per rupee as a medicine (maghz tarbuz).\n\nPoppy cultivation was at one time a source of considerable wealth to the district, especially to the villages round Shahpur, and to Katha Masral and Saghral at the mouth of the Vahi gorge. To quote Mr. Wilson:\n\n\"The following figures will give some idea of the extent and value of the crop:\n\n| Year          | Area cultivated | Opium extracted | Average outturn per acre | Wholesale price per seer | Average realized |\n|---------------|-----------------|-----------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------|\n|               | Acres           | Mds.            | Seers                    | Rs.                      | Rs.             |\n| 1860          | ...             | ...             | ...                      | ...                      | Nil.            |\n| 1866          | 3,000           | 450             | 6                        | 10                       | Nil.            |\n| Average of five years ending 1889. | 2,830           | 413             | 6                        | 13                       | 6,231           |\n| 1889-90       | 4,005           | 840             | 8                        | 13                       | 8,962           |\n| 1890-91       | 3,535           | 707             | 8                        | 12                       | 7,510           |\n\nThe average outturn per acre may be taken as six seers and Rs. 8 per seer as the price of the fresh juice (which loses one-fourth of its weight in drying, giving Rs. 48 as the average price of the opium of an acre of poppy. Adding to this Rs. 10 as the value of the poppy-seed gives the total value of the produce as Rs. 58 per acre. The crop is generally sold standing to Khatri speculators at a price averaging about Rs. 50 per acre but varying from Rs. 20 to Rs. 80 or more according to the promise of the outturn.\"\n\nThe loss of a crop worth nearly 2 lakhs of rupees is a small set-off against the many improvements that have taken place.\n\nWhen a crop has been sown, its produce even on irrigated land depends very much on the quantity and opportuneness of the subsequent rainfall, and, as that is exceedingly variable in this district, the outturn varies greatly from year to year and from village to village. The crops are also apt to be choked by weeds, of which the most troublesome are the leha, a thistle-like weed, which especially infests lands flooded by the river, the\npohli or yellow star-thistle, and the onion-like bhukat, which is very common on poor lands irrigated from wells. The peasants rarely take sufficient trouble to eradicate these weeds which consume a large proportion of the nourishment in the soil. In the riverain mice multiply in dry years and devour the kernel of cotton seed and other crops. Birds and insects of all kinds greatly reduce the outturn of the crops. In the kharif harvest considerable trouble is taken to drive away the birds from the ripening joudar and bajra crop, and when locusts make their appearance, a campaign is organised against them and myriads of them are killed; but against the ravages of other insects the peasant is almost helpless. An account of recent visitations of locusts will be found in Chapter I, where also the boll-worm and other insects that attack the crops are mentioned. Wheat often suffers in cloudy weather from rust (kungi) which greatly reduces the size and weight of the grain; hot winds also cause the grain to shrivel up and are especially injurious in the lands lying along the foot of the Salt Range. Hail-storms often do great but partial damage; and an account of a very destructive storm will be found in Chapter I. White ants (siwi) attack the roots of many plants, and weevils (ghun) consume much of the ill-garnished grain. Altogether the quantity of food that reaches the mouths of the people is no large multiple of the seed that is sown.\n\nThe figures for total cultivated and irrigated areas will be found in Table 18. According to the professional revenue survey made at various times between 1853 and 1865 the total area of the district is 4,791 square miles; according to the recent remeasurements made by the patwars it is 4,800 square miles, of which in 1915, 1,187 square miles were returned as uncultivable, 1,588 as culturable, and only 2,024 square miles or less than a half of the total area of the district as under cultivation. Alterations in the district boundary described in Chapter I, Section B, have resulted in a total gain of 94 square miles since 1893.\n\nAccording to the records of regular settlement which were compiled at different times between 1855 and 1864, the total cultivated area excluding land recently thrown out of cultivation was 304,770 acres. The area under cultivation has gone on steadily increasing year by year and was returned in 1888 as 612,659 acres, in 1893 as 687,217 acres, and in 1915 as 1,295,409 acres, or much more than four times the area of regular settlement. During the last fifteen years cultivation has increased at the average rate of more than 33,000 acres per annum. The reason for the great increase between first and second settlements was the increased security brought by settled conditions, the modera-\ntion of the demand, above all the sinking of wells and excavation of inundation canals. These factors have all continued in operation, and, in addition, the Lower Jhelum Canal has been constructed, and the possibilities of gram cultivation in the Thal have been discovered. It is on the unirrigated lands that development is now proceeding most rapidly, and it is worth noting that the 1,194 square miles recorded as unculturable include an area of about 470 square miles which would be culturable, if it were not reserved forest.\n\nThe increase in cultivation on each of the main classes of land has been as follows:\n\n| Area in acres at | Ch\u00e1hi and Ch\u00e1hi-nahri | Nahri and nahri-tjhal\u00e1ri | S\u00e1il\u00e1b | B\u00e1ran\u00ed | Total |\n|------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|--------|--------|-------|\n| Regular Settlement | ...                   | 181,545                  | 2,192  | 45,625 | 125,508 | 304,870 |\n| 1893-1894        | ...                   | 286,524                  | 87,654 | 69,838 | 298,201 | 687,217 |\n| 1914-15          | ...                   | 137,369                  | 785,805| 61,701 | 310,540 | 1,295,409 |\n\nOut of the nahri area 673,789 acres are on the perennial canal, 110,539 are on the inundation canals and khar\u00edf distributaries, and 1,477 on perennial streams in the hills. The decrease in s\u00e1il\u00e1b is due to the transfer to Gujr\u00e1t District of riverain villages both on the Chenab and on the Jhelum. The great decrease in ch\u00e1hi is due to the supersession of wells by canals, especially in the Chenab and Ara circles, already noticed in Chapter I\u2014A.\n\nIn the early days of the Lower Jhelum Colony, Mr. Hailey started a farm at Sargodha for the dissemination of pure seed among the colonists; but little was accomplished until, in 1913, the farm was placed under the control of the Director of Agriculture, and managed by an Agricultural Assistant, with a muqaddam, a beld\u00e1r, and one pair of bullocks to carry out field operations. Half a square of very poor land is cultivated by the staff, in order to demonstrate the extent to which natural disadvantages can be overcome by improved methods: the remaining five squares are made over to tenants, who put in practice the teaching of the Department. The most important results obtained so far are as follows:\n\n(a) Distribution of improved implements:\u2014During the past 2\u00bd years, peasants have been induced to purchase 50 Raja and 60 Meston ploughs, 10 spring toothed harrows, 12 fodder-cutters, and 1 Raja reaper, and there is good reason to believe that all these implements will rapidly increase in popularity.\n(b) Selection of suitable types of seed.\u2014So far as present experience goes, the most important results can be obtained by encouraging the use of wheat, type No. 11 (L\u00e1l Kas\u00e1rv\u00e1li) and cotton, type No. 4 F. American. Of the former 3,500 maunds were sold to peasants for the 1916 crop, and it fetches at least 2 annas per maund more than the 'ghoni' variety. The selected American cotton in 1915 sold at Rs. 10-11-3 per maund, the current rate for common Desi cotton on the same date being Rs. 7-8-0. Australian bajra also has just been introduced, and is likely to become very popular.\n\nAn agricultural association was formed in December 1915, under the Presidentship of the Deputy Commissioner. Hitherto the objects aimed at have been the lending out on approval of improved implements and the organization of public opinion with a view to minimising the extortions of petty officials. Already good results have been obtained, and with proper encouragement the association should prove eminently useful.\n\nIn the District Board garden at Sargodha and the \"Company garden\" at Shahpur, experiments are being made with oranges from Gujr\u00e1nw\u00e1la. At Sakesar the Deputy Commissioner looks after a few olive trees planted by Mr. Mitchell of Kashmir, but so far not much success has been attained. Potatoes are being tried at Kathwai and Uchhali, and ought to do well in the Salt Range, but the Awans are slow to take up a new crop. The Economic Botanist has endeavoured to interest the owners of large palm-groves in the south of Khush\u00e1b Tahsil in Basra date-palms, and they are beginning to respond, but have so far not planted any. An attempt might also be made to start lucerne on rappar lands near the river, which are incapable of producing ordinary crops. There are several small gardens kept up by the District Board in various places, but between them they produce very little eatable fruit or vegetables; the garden at Sodhi Jaiw\u00e1li is the best.\n\nTable 20 shows the extent to which use is made of the Land Improvements and Agriculturists Loans Acts. Considering the large number of wells in the district, not much is borrowed for their construction, and, as Co-operative Credit Societies multiply, probably less use will be made of the Act than ever. Occasionally an Awan borrows money for the construction of an embankment, but generally this kind of work is done by the system of labour co-operation known as Wang\u00e1r. In times of fodder-famine, large sums are distributed to cattle owners and when drought has greatly reduced the stocks of grain money is advanc-\ned for the purchase of seed. Thus Rs. 64,525 were advanced in 1911-12. As a rule repayments are punctually made, and the benefits of both Acts are clear.\n\nAn entirely new influence, which promises to enlarge the minds and improve the prospects of an adult population far beyond Government's sphere of influence, has come into being in the last seven years in the shape of Rural Banks, or Co-operative Credit Societies. The first Societies of the district were registered in 1909, and in two years the advantages of the co-operative idea were clearly recognized in the most progressive Tahsils\u2014Sargodha and Bhera; even as late as 1914 there were only 4 Societies in Shahpur and none in Khush\u00e1b. The figures printed in the margin will show what substantial progress had been made by 31st July 1915. It has only been found necessary to wind up 4 banks so far, so it is clear that due caution has been observed in expanding the scope of the movement. In addition to the Village Societies (technically known as Class I, Unlimited) there is a Central Bank at Sargodha and a Central Union Bank at Chak 33 S. B. known as the Pindi Chiman Union Bank. The former was opened on 21st April 1910, with 182 shareholders, and a working capital of Rs. 41,838; it has now 196 members, and a working capital of Rs. 1,45,196; in 1915 it made a net profit of Rs. 5,135, and paid a dividend of 8 per cent. The Pindi Chiman Union Bank opened on 11th August 1911, with 7 shareholders, and a working capital of Rs. 14,579; in 1915 the capital had increased to Rs. 26,534, and the profit amounted to Rs. 788. There is also one non-agricultural society (Class II) at Bhera which has 39 weaver shareholders. This was registered in February 1911 with a capital of Rs. 467. In 1915, the capital amounted to Rs. 4,361; the gross profits to date were Rs. 1,590, out of which Rs. 619 went to the expenses of management leaving Rs. 971 net profit, which has been added to the working capital. The dividend on shares has averaged no less than 56 per cent. per annum, and the enterprise seems to be doing remarkably well.\nA similar society was started in Khush\u00e1b in 1911, with 86 share-holders and Rs. 2,231 capital, but after about a year and a half, the society, owing to deficient cohesion and enterprise, ceased working and the capital which had reached Rs. 5,854 was refunded. All Societies are supervised by the Registrar of Co-operative Credit Societies whose head-quarters are at Lahore, and who enjoys the services of an Assistant for the Western Range of the province. There is an Inspector at Sargodha, with 3 stipendiary and 2 honorary Sub-Inspectors working under him. The duties of the official staff are advisory and regulative; management is so far as possible left to the members. It is for this reason that the movement is probably even more important as an educative factor than as an economic revolution.\n\nThe exact amount of unsecured debt due from agriculturists to money-lenders is not ascertainable but it undoubtedly amounts to a formidable total. In the great majority of cases however indebtedness is entirely due to extravagance or thriftlessness. Weddings are of course the occasion of much unnecessary outlay; litigation not infrequently involves borrowing, and some of the better class families are apt to set themselves too high a standard of hospitality. There is a regrettable tradition that it is unseemly for a man of any status to accept payment for the supplies consumed by officials on tour, and this has impoverished several worthy families, in much frequented villages.\n\nWhen an agriculturist resorts to the money-lender, he is in most cases entirely unable to arrange reasonable terms. Interest at 2 per cent. per month is quite commonly agreed to, and 1 per cent. per month is considered very moderate. Up to the time of the passing of the Alienation of Land Act, the interest was always allowed to accumulate until the creditor could insist on the debtor parting with some of his land. The advantage of co-operative banks consists partly in the reduction of the rate of interest charged to borrowers to something between 9\u00bd and 12\u00bd per cent. per annum, and partly in the steps taken to insist on punctual repayment. The rate of interest charged by Central Banks is generally 8 per cent. There can be no doubt that a little determination on the part of the creditors would wipe out most of the unsecured debt in a very short space of time.\n\nAfter the transaction has been completed, the creditor is generally in an even stronger position than before: Mr. Wilson's description of the various devices for getting more than the pound of flesh is worth repeating.\n\"The better class of Hindu and Sikh bankers and shopkeepers keep three account books (vahi), (1) the day-book (suhr, parchun or bandi), in which all transactions are recorded day by day as they occur; (2), the cash-book (rokir) in which only cash transactions are entered as they occur; and (3) the ledger (khata vahi or simply vahi), in which each client's account (lekha) is written up from the day book at the shopkeeper's leisure. The great majority of shop keepers, however, keep up only the ledger, making entries in it from memory or from rough notes which are destroyed, so that there is no means of checking the entries. The ledger (vahi) is kept in the form of loose leaves fastened together lengthwise in such a way that a leaf can easily be extracted without detection. Each page (panna) has its number (angg), and it is usual, on opening a new ledger, to get a Brahman to imprint on the seventh page a coloured picture of Ganesh and his rat, adding the invocation 'Om Svasti Ganeshaya nama' with the date and a blessing. The account of each client shows on the left side the debits or out-goings, and on the right side the credits (agit). Generally once a year the balance (baki) is struck, interest (veaf) charged, and the net balance carried forward to a new account. As the peasant who has his dealings with the shopkeeper (kirar) is often utterly ignorant of accounts and very careless, he is often taken advantage of by the shopkeeper, who will, as occasion offers,\n\n(1) dole out old grain of sorts for food purposes in the cold season and take repayment at harvest time, a few months later, in wheat or its money equivalent, plus from 25 to 50 per cent. interest;\n\n(2) exact full repayment on the threshing-floor, leaving the customer insufficient grain wherefrom to pay his land revenue, and feed himself till next harvest;\n\n(3) a month or so later pay his debtor's land revenue and taking advantage of his necessity, charge him at least the highest average rate for money lent;\n\n(4) take one-anna per rupee as discount (katt or gadd chhora) when making a loan, but charge interest on the discount;\n\n(5) cut six months' interest out of a loan, and record the gross sum as a loan free of interest for six months;\n\n(6) cause the debtor to go before the Sub-Registrar and state that he has received the whole loan in cash, whereas in fact the amount was chiefly made up of simple and compound interest;\n\n(7) misrepresent debits in the ledger by entering inferior grains as if wheat;\n\n(8) allow no interest on repayments in kind and either no or short interest on credit in cash, and cause the customer to believe, when he is making a payment to account, that a concession of grace has been made when a small remission is credited to him out of the interest due (chhot or mor);\n\n(9) generally keep accounts in a loose unintelligible way which makes the separation of interest from principal impossible;\n\n(10) keep only a ledger, plus sometimes a sort of day-book in loose sheets or book form, and write up the former at any time.\"\n(11) strike the balance in a casual way, naming as present one or two witnesses either brother lenders or men of the class known as 'four anna witnesses;'\n\n(12) charge a full year's interest on grain or money, lent a few months or even weeks before the striking of balance.\"\n\nIn the Southern Thal, the peasants regularly deposit their crops and wool with the village shop-keeper, and obtain from him sufficient for their daily needs; the balance of money due from one to the other is struck once or twice in the year, and, whatever the harvest has been like, is always in favour of the shop-keeper. This is the *reductio ad absurdum* of bucolic simplicity. It must however be admitted that there are some peasants who borrow money with the deliberate intention of avoiding repayment; when it comes to executing a decree, the law is by no means always on the side of the creditor.\n\nMost of the Musalm\u00e1ns of this district, if they are in a position to lend money at all, do so on mortgage: loans with interest in cash are very uncommon. In fact the religious scruples of Isl\u00e1m in the matter of us\u00fary still deter many from joining in the co-operative movement. Khojas and Pir\u00e1chas however have no objection to ordinary money-lending.\n\nThe objection to a fixed rate of interest does not prevent the peasants from indulging in a wild speculation. In the winter of 1911 a great part of the riverain, and Salt Range was infected with the 'Sh\u00e1di Fund' craze. This was professedly a scheme of insurance against marriage-expenses! Actually it was a swindle exactly similar to Mr. Montague Tigg's Anglo-Bengalee venture in \"Martin Chuzzlewit.\" So long as subscriptions were coming in, claims on marriage were handsomely met: the Directors (among whom were a few agriculturists of some standing) pocketed considerable fees, and innumerable agents took large commissions. The inevitable smash was not long delayed, and although the resulting criminal cases broke down, most of the funds paid up some annas in the rupee, and it was generally stated that on the whole the bulk of the loss fell on persons of the Kir\u00e1r class. But the peasants became more suspicious than ever of the co-operative movement, which was just beginning to make some headway.\n\nAt last settlement Mr. Wilson drew a very gloomy picture of the process by which the peasant-proprietors were being ousted from their ancestral lands by a ruthless crowd of shylocks. He calculated that in three years one per cent. of the privately owned land passed by sale into the hands of money-lenders, at a price which had risen from 10 to 20 rupees per acre. Table\n21 shows the later chapters of this tale. The whole may be summarized thus:\n\n| Average of sales per annum | Number of sales | Acres sold | Price per acre |\n|---------------------------|----------------|------------|---------------|\n| 1870\u20141879                 |                |            |               |\n| 1880\u20141889                 |                |            |               |\n| 1890\u20141899                 |                |            |               |\n| 1900\u20141909                 |                |            |               |\n| 1910\u20141914                 |                |            |               |\n\nIn the year 1900-01 no less than 22,628 acres were sold, of which 15,641 were in the Bhera Tahsil; and in the next year 10,867 acres, of which 7,383 were in Bhera. The Alienation of Land Act came into force during this last year, and the effect was immediate. For the Bhera riverain it was only just in time\u2014a very large area had passed beyond recall to men who knew nothing about agriculture except its profits. Since 1901, although the area transferred annually is still considerable, at least the vendees are practically all men with some knowledge of land, and some claims to live on the soil. At present the bulk of the transfers are taking place in Khush\u00e1b Tahsil, and there the land is of comparatively little value and most of the owners have more than they can manage.\n\nMr. Wilson pointed out that in the majority of cases a mortgage to a money-lender was practically equivalent to a sale. The history of mortgages is this:\n\n| Average of mortgages per annum | Number of mortgages | Acres mortgaged | Mortgage-money per acre |\n|--------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------|-------------------------|\n| 1870\u20141879                     | 329                 | 7,820           | Rs. 9                   |\n| 1880\u20141889                     | 1,266               | 19,349          | Rs. 9                   |\n| 1890\u20141899                     | 2,377               | 20,393          | Rs. 18                  |\n| 1900\u20141909                     | 1,165               | 6,589           | Rs. 34                  |\n| 1910\u20141914                     | 1,645               | 7,882           | Rs. 54                  |\n\nHere the improvement is really startling; the peasants all assert that it was not till the Alienation of Land Act was passed that they realized the importance of retaining possession of their lands, or only parting with it for full value. The slight rise in the\nlast five years may be partly attributed to the fact that settlement operations have brought a number of old mortgages to light. It is to be noticed that the majority of the mortgages are now taking place in Khush\u00e1b Tahsil, but there one good harvest renders possible extensive redemptions. The progress of redemptions has been as follows:\n\n| Average of redemptions per annum | Number of redemptions | Acres redeemed | Mortgage money per acre |\n|----------------------------------|-----------------------|----------------|------------------------|\n| 1870\u20141879                        | 69                    | 1,652          | Rs 5\u00bd                  |\n| 1880\u20141889                        | 304                   | 5,724          | 6                      |\n| 1890\u20141899                        | 1,217                 | 13,188         | 13                     |\n| 1900\u20141909                        | 1,490                 | 10,971         | 19                     |\n| 1909\u20141914                        | 1,959                 | 12,947         | 23                     |\n\nHere again the improvement is obvious; for even if we assume (what is not the case) that all the land sold was previously mortgaged, and so ought to be deducted from the area redeemed in order to show effective redemptions, we find that in the decade 1890\u20141899 over 30,600 acres were annually sold and mortgaged, as against 13,000 redeemed; while in the succeeding decade only 16,000 were annually sold and mortgaged as against 11,000 redeemed; and in the past five years 16,000 have been sold and mortgaged as against 13,000 redeemed. And it must be remembered that much of the land now being sold and mortgaged is waste land, which the owners are unable to cultivate. Thus it was found in Khush\u00e1b Tahsil that though between settlements the non-agriculturists had gained an area of 3,822 acres net from the agriculturists, the latter had actually recovered possession of 1,875 net acres cultivated. The introduction of Co-operative Credit and the Redemption of Land Act have both given a new impetus towards emancipation of the peasants, and the present condition of affairs may be regarded as decidedly satisfactory.\nThe total effect of transfers upon the amount of land held under mortgage with possession now as compared with previous settlements is this:\n\n| Period                  | Number of mortgages | Area under mortgage in acres | Revenue assessment of mortgaged land | Percentage of mortgage land on total assessment of the district | Percentage to total cultivated area of area held under mortgage |\n|-------------------------|---------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|\n| At regular Settlement, 1856\u20141858. | 3,107               | 38,008                       | 21,243                               | 24,243                                                        | 6                                                             |\n| In 1893                 | 14,627              | 158,642                      | 80,766                               | 74,362                                                        | 13                                                            |\n| In 1914-15              | 17,062              | 126,480                      | 75,113                               | 45,488                                                        | 2                                                             |\n\nThe area held by non-agriculturists in 1914-15 was 84,695 acres, of which 47,007 were cultivated and paid revenue amounting to Rs. 30,460, or 4 per cent. of the revenue of the district. In 1893 non-agriculturists held 58,500 cultivated acres, paying Rs. 52,053 as revenue, or 9 per cent. of the total assessment.\n\nIt must be remembered that some of the area now mortgaged will automatically revert to the possession of the owners by mere lapse of time, without any payment of money. Nearly 4,500 acres cultivated are mortgaged in this way in the Bhera and Shahpur riverain. It is in the riverain that mortgage is still most general. In the Bhera Jhelum Circles it covers 13 per cent. of the cultivated area, in the Shahpur-Jhelum 12 per cent. and in the Khush\u00e1b-Jhelum 15 per cent.\n\nThe figures in the foregoing paragraph indicate that the value of land has nearly doubled since the passing of the Alienation Act, and has trebled since settlement. Mortgage values are little more than half sale values, but in the latter case pre-emption is a factor that tends to obscure the truth. Recent sales of land on the Jhelum Canal indicate a value of about Rs. 4,50 per square, or over Rs. 150 per acre. Well lands in the riverain range between Rs. 120 and Rs. 250 though specially good lands would of course command a much higher price. Inundation canal land would fetch from Rs. 80 to Rs. 150 according to quality, and sail\u00e1b about Rs. 150. Of the o\u00e1r\u00e1ni soils very high prices are paid for the best fields on the hill torrents, and it would be difficult to buy a good average 'hail' field for less than Rs. 400 an acre. On the other\nhand it would probably be possible to buy land in the Thal for Rs. 50 or less, and for intermediate grades of land any price between these extremes might be asked for. On the most modest computation, the selling value of the proprietary and colonist rights in the district is now 18 crores of rupees; Mr. Wilson estimated it at 3 crores.\n\nThe professional money lender is now as good as barred from the permanent acquisition of land, except from his own kind. Not that he really has much to complain of, as he made the very most of his opportunities up to the very day that ended his golden age, and still holds land in value out of all proportion to what he actually paid for it. The persons who have to some extent occupied the market thus vacated are the Tiwana Maliks and other wealthy land-owners, and the men who have saved up some capital out of their military pay. But probably the bulk of the transfers now taking place are between ordinary peasant-farmers, and the general effect is to transfer land from the inefficient or the unfortunate to those who are more likely to make the best use of it. Not without reason is the name of Mr. S. S. Thorburn held in grateful remembrance.\n\nThe agricultural stock of the district has been carefully enumerated at various times (see table No. 22), and the following statement gives the results of the more important enumerations:\n\n| Year | Cows, bullocks and buffaloes of all ages | Sheep and goats | Horses and ponies | Mules and donkeys | Camels | Yokes of plough bullocks |\n|------|------------------------------------------|----------------|------------------|------------------|--------|------------------------|\n| 1869 | 154,163                                  | 172,883        | 3,485            | 9,495            | 14,908 | 33,535                 |\n| 1890 | 330,794                                  | 308,883        | 6,636            | 19,347           | 16,319 | 53,546                 |\n| 1900 | 469,784                                  | 440,679        | 10,086           | 23,854           | 18,058 | 68,418                 |\n| 1910 | 628,441                                  | 479,685        | 27,082           | 33,794           | 18,360 | 88,426                 |\n| 1914 | 694,901                                  | 460,856        | 31,516           | 44,862           | 18,141 | 102,055                |\n\nThe details of the horned cattle in the 1914 census were as follows:\n\n- Bulls and bullocks: 204,110\n- Cows: 179,115\n- Male buffaloes: 20,513\n- Cow buffaloes: 120,511\n- Young stock: 170,652\nIt is to be noticed that horned cattle are more than four times as numerous as they were at regular settlement, and nearly twice as numerous as they were at second settlement. Bullocks and cows have each increased in number by about 50 per cent since second settlement, while buffaloes and young stock have more than doubled. Sheep and goats increased by 150 per cent between 1869 and 1900, but since then have not made much progress. Horses and ponies are nearly 10 times as numerous as they were in 1869, and more than 3 times as numerous as they were 15 years ago. Mules and donkeys double their numbers every twenty years. Camels are not making very much progress, though, when it is considered to what extent their favourite haunts have come under the plough, it is perhaps surprising that they have not lost ground.\n\nAt last settlement Mr. Wilson calculated that the live-stock of the district were worth 85 lakhs of rupees.\n\nA similar calculation now gives the following result:\n\n| Animals          | Average value | Total value |\n|------------------|---------------|-------------|\n| Bulls and bullocks | ...           | Rs.         | Rs.         |\n| Cows             | ...           | 40          | 81,64,400   |\n| Male buffaloes   | ...           | 40          | 71,64,600   |\n| Cow buffaloes    | ...           | 80          | 8,20,520    |\n| Young stock      | ...           | 15          | 96,40,880   |\n| Sheep            | ...           | 5           | 25,59,780   |\n| Goats            | ...           | 5           | 16,45,460   |\n| Horses and ponies| ...           | 100         | 6,58,820    |\n| Mules and donkeys| ...           | 15          | 31,51,600   |\n| Camels           | ...           | 100         | 6,72,930    |\n\nOf course in years of scarcity like the present, prices drop below these averages, and animals change hands for little more than the value of their hides and bones. But in a good year it would be impossible to replace the existing live-stock for less than 3 crores of rupees. The following accounts of special species have been kindly compiled by Mr. Medows, Civil Veterinary Department:\u2014\nThere are numerous and mixed types on account of many strains having been brought in by colonists and traders.\n\nThe original breeds appear to have been the B\u00e1r and the Thal breeds. The former are medium-sized cattle rarely higher than 48 inches at the shoulder with narrow chests and thick skin and over-developed dewlaps and sheaths usually grey or light red in colour. Some of the cows are said to give up to 8 seers of milk, cows sometimes fetch up to Rs. 100, bullocks rarely more than Rs. 80. The Thal breed are of much smaller size, but otherwise they resemble the B\u00e1r breed though they are of more compact and even build. The cows give up to about 3 seers of milk, cows fetch up to Rs. 40, bullocks up to Rs. 25. This breed is still numerous though the B\u00e1r breed has become scarce. In the S\u00fan il\u00e1qua the cattle are almost all of Dhanni type, strong, fast, and hardy and usually of piebald colour. The cows are poor milkers. The bullocks sometimes sell up to Rs. 170, cows rarely more than Rs. 50.\n\nThe effect of the District Board bulls is now becoming very noticeable. The bulls supplied are usually of the Hissari breed, but in the Khush\u00e1b Tahsil which is too poor to support Hissaris and in localities where colonists from the northern districts shew a preference for their own breed, Dhannis are supplied. Hissari cross bullocks fetch up to Rs. 180 and Dhanni crosses up to Rs. 150.\n\nThere is no very important cattle fair anywhere in this neighbourhood, although a good deal of buying and selling is done at the Sargodha and Shahpur horse-fairs. Considerable numbers of young stock are sold, especially in a dry year, to itinerant cattle-dealers, who take them to R\u00e1walpindi or Pesh\u00e1war.\n\nThere has been an extraordinary increase in the number of cow buffaloes, partly owing to the increase in cultivation and partly, no doubt, to the increased prosperity of the people. They are found chiefly in the Cis-Jhelum part of the district and are often stall-fed but in the hot weather are driven down to the river belas where they find a nutritious food in the kah grass (saccharum spontaneum).\n\nThere does not appear to be any well-defined breed; strains from many localities have been mixed together by the colonists. Generally the buffaloes are of moderate size and fairly well shaped.\n\nFemales sometimes sell for as much as Rs. 230 but males seldom sell for more than Rs. 80.\nThe cattle-owners of the district derive a large income annually from the sale of *ghi*, the price of which had risen from Rs. 8 per maund before annexation and Rs. 13 per maund at regular settlement to an average of Rs. 23 per maund at second settlement, and is now over Rs. 40. The amount of milk given by the half-starved cows of the district is often over-estimated. While good cows giving 8 seers of milk a day or more can sometimes be procured, the average cow of the district probably does not give more than 1\u00bd seers of milk per day for six or nine months of the year. Similarly a very good buffalo-cow will give as much as 13 seers of milk a day, but the average buffalo-cow of the district probably does not give more than 3 seers a day for 11 months. One seer of cow\u2019s milk gives an ounce of butter and one seer of buffalo\u2019s milk two ounces, and a third of the weight of butter goes in the process of making it into *ghi*; so that a cow on the average gives about 6 seers of *ghi* in nine months, and a buffalo-cow about 30 seers of *ghi* in 11 months. A large quantity of *ghi* is annually exported to Peshawar, Rawalpindi, Amritsar, Dera Ismail Khan and Karachi.\n\nCow hides sometimes sell for as much as Rs. 35 per maund, and buffalo hides for Rs. 25.\n\nLarge numbers of cattle are annually carried off by disease, and the people are very careless in protecting them from contagion. Outbreaks of rinderpest and foot-and-mouth disease are of almost annual recurrence, and the sick and healthy animals may often be seen standing together, or shut up in the same cow-house. The following account of the common diseases with their native names and remedies is taken from a Civil Veterinary Report on the cattle of the Shahpur District furnished by Veterinary Surgeon J. A. Nunn in 1884:\n\n**Rinderpest**\u2014(*chaddi\u00e1n, chechok, pir n\u00e1ta, pirig\u00e1n, dhakka w\u00e1h* and *puki*).\u2014Treatment: 1st, sulphur, salt and ginger in equal parts are given as a drench; 2nd, nitre, camphor and pounded *dhot\u00e1ra* seeds, mixed with *gur* and water; 3rd, in first stages, milk and *ghi* is given as a drench, afterwards *kikar* leaves are mixed with butter into a paste and given as an electuary; 4th, *katha* (*acacia catechu*, the native *catechu*) is mixed with country wine as a drench.\n\n**Foot-and-mouth disease** (*munk khur*).\u2014Treatment, &c.: salt and powdered *ajwain* (*ligusticum ajowan*) seeds are given as a bolus when ulcers are only seen in the mouth. When the feet are attacked, *sandh\u00far* (red oxide of lead) is made into a paste with lamp-black and applied locally. Another prescription is salt, sweet oil and *ghi* given internally.\n\n**Anthrax** (*garlu, satt*) affects cattle. The symptoms described coincide with those of black quarter, viz., that it chiefly attacks animals after rain, when there is a great spring of fresh grass or when they are pastured on\nmarshy ground. Swellings appear on the various parts of the body, and the animal quickly dies. It is described as being incurable, but sometimes treatment is tried, by giving large quantities of ghi and milk, and firing the swelling.\n\n**Gloss anthrax or malignant throat (ga'ghotu).**\u2014Both diseases are described by this name, but more generally it is gloss anthrax that is meant. It is considered very fatal, and the only treatment adopted is the application of the actual cautery to the trachea, and round the throat under the jaw.\n\n**Splenic apoplexy (tili and huka).**\u2014The only treatment adopted is bleeding from the inside of the nostrils and making an incision on the bridge of the nose.\n\n**Rheumatism (dabok, tak).**\u2014Rheumatism in horned cattle is met by the following treatment. Asafoetida (hing) and guggal or miense (dalomeia macrocephala) mixed in flour is given and the back rubbed with dry ajwain (liquisticum ajowan). The patient is kept in a warm room, and bleeding had recourse to from the ears and tail.\n\n**Colic (dard shikan or sul).**\u2014Treatment: Country spirit, tobacco, ghi, gur, salt and ajwain, mixed with vinegar and water in which leather has been soaked. Ghi and milk given in large quantities is said to be a certain cure.\n\n**Hoose or husk (dhans)\u2014Guggat (dalomeia macrocephala), asafetida and onions made into a bolus with barley flour is given, about a chhatka, and the smoke of a burning black rag is blown up the nostrils.**\n\n**Chronic indigestion (jagir).**\u2014All grain is stopped, and ground ginger, salt, amla (emblica officinalis), ajwain is given in water.\n\n**Lymphanitis (patha lag qea).**\u2014Gur and bajra (penicillaria spinata) flour are given as a drench, and the animal is bled underneath the tongue.\n\n**Tleuro-pneumonia contagiosa.\u2014Phepri or khulak,\u2014mehdi (lawsonia inermis), katira (cochlospermum gossypium) (or salix babylonia), ajwain, gur and water are given internally.**\n\n**Prolapsus uteri (dhans or havans).**\u2014The organ is anointed with oil and a rope truss applied.\n\n**Red water (hamalo albuminuria).**\u2014Loya or halla, katira (cochlospermum gossypium) is soaked all night in an earthen vessel and the liquor given as a drench with barley flour gruel.\n\n**Tetanus (trismus) (mukh band).**\u2014A line is drawn all round the body commencing at the nose, with a hot iron, and the following drench given. Majith (madder, rubia cordifolia or R. tinctorum), haldi (turmeric, curcuma longa) and gur mixed with water.\n\n**Umbilical hernia (phor).**\u2014The hernial sac is fired and perva (cotton-seeds and mustard oil) given as a drench.\n\n**Bilious fever (Sirdai).**\u2014Salt, ajwain and water coloured with mehdi (lawsonia inermis) is given internally.\n\n**Diuresis (dhakutra).**\u2014Katira (C. gossypium) and water coloured with mehdi are given internally.\n\n**Mange (khurak).**\u2014Sulphur is given internally in the food and the body is washed with soft soap.\nUnlike every other kind of live-stock, the number of camels has scarcely risen since regular settlement, owing partly to the development of cultivation, the fodder grown on cultivated lands being more suitable for feeding horned cattle than camels, but chiefly owing to the development of roads and railways which have lessened the demand for camels as beasts of burden.\n\nThere are two distinct breeds of baggage camels, the B\u00e1r breed\u2014large and heavy animals averaging nearly seven feet in height, with wide chests and strong bone and slow paces, usually grey or fawn coloured\u2014and the Thal breed\u2014smaller and lighter with straight shoulders and narrow quarters, usually brown or fawn coloured and often weakly and poorly developed from having to live mainly or entirely on l\u00e2na. The B\u00e1r breed bring up to Rs. 180 and the Thal breed up to Rs. 150. The camels used for riding purposes are rarely bred locally but are usually bought from traders at early ages and used for riding from about four years of age, up to about 6, when their paces become slower and shakier and they are then used for baggage work. The female camels are little used as beasts of burden, but are allowed to roam about the jungle with their young; while the male camels are annually in the cold weather employed in the carrying trade sometimes at a great distance from their owners' homes. A considerable number are employed in carrying salt from the mines at W\u00e2rchha. The profits of camel-breeding and camel-hiring, however, are not what they used to be, except in wartime. A camel reaches maturity at about 8 years, is fit for work up to 15 years, and seldom lives over 20 years.\n\nThe history of the young camel (toda) until fit for sale may briefly be described as follows:\u2014The stallion or bull-camel is allowed to run with the herd of \"d\u00e1chis,\" probably numbering 25 to 30, from November to January. The period of gestation is 12 months and d\u00e1chis therefore drop their foals in the following November to February. The young camel drinks his mother's milk alone for about six months and is known during this period as \"Liyara.\" During the next six he gradually learns to graze but depends to a certain extent on his mother's milk for sustenance: during this time he is known as \"Kotelah.\" The d\u00e1chi is now again put to the bull and the young camel is weaned and is known as \"Mazz\u00e1t\" for another year. After this he becomes Trih\u00e1n (3 years old), Chhatr (4 years old), Doak (5 years old), Chauga (6 years old), Chhigga (7 years old), Nesh (8 years old), Parmosh (9 years old). Then Ek sal ka nesh, do sal ka nesh, and so on. A male camel is also called lihak and a female puraph from two to four years old. A male camel\nof about thirteen is called *armosh*, and after fifteen a male is called *Khamb* and a female *jharot*. The native camel-owner will teach the \"Trihan,\" if well grown, to bear light burdens, which are increased as he becomes \"chhatr\" and he carries a full-load of 5 maunds by the time he is *Doakk*, if not before. A well-grown \"Chauga\" or \"Chhigga\" is considered to be well up to $7\\frac{1}{2}$ maunds. The poor or avaricious owner, over-anxious to get work from his stock as soon as possible, often works his animals too young or gives them loads to carry which they are not fit to bear, with disastrous results. Owing also to scanty grazing, due perhaps to shortage of rain, etc., the *dachis* and young are often half starved, and many a promising youngster suffers in consequence.\n\nYoung are sold as \"Mazzat,\" or even as an old \"Kotelah\" to camel-traders and are reared by their new owners. The market price for good class \"Kotelah\" or \"Mazzat\" varies from Rs. 30 to Rs. 40 and Rs. 50 to Rs. 60 respectively.\n\nCamel's milk, from which butter cannot be made, is drunk by the camel-breeder; camel's hair (*milass*) is used to make ropes and coarse sacks (*bori*); and from camel's hide (worth about Rs. 2 per hide) are made the large jars (*kuppa*) in which *ghi* is carried. The camel, although he can eat most plants and find food for himself in almost any jungle, is particularly fond of the salsolas (*khar* or *tana*) and of the leaves of the acacia (*kikar* or *phulah*). He is a delicate animal and is subject to many diseases. Some of them are described as follows by Mr. Nunn:\n\nAnthrax (*chhalli*) is described as being most contagious and destroying hundreds of camels annually. The symptoms are red, i.e., dark coloured urine, and a most offensive or putrid smell from the animal before death, with rapid decomposition afterwards. It is looked upon as being incurable, but sometimes chillies are given powdered and mixed with *gur* or the animal is tied up in a warm place, and almonds, fresh blood of a goat, honey, *pipal* (*ficus religiosa*), black pepper, and asafetida is given.\n\n*Jakarjana* or rheumatism.\u2014*Ajwain* (*liquisticum ajowan*) mixed with the urine of another camel is given for three or four days when the animal is said to generally recover.\n\n*Hubbi* or strangles\u2014The swelling and abscess is said sometimes to extend down the neck to the sternum, the part is fired and *mako* (*solanum nigrum*) and *amaltas* (*cathartocarpu fistula*), the Indian laburnum seeds, boiled in water is tied on the wound as poultice.\nKipali, catarrh or influenza.\u2014The symptoms are drooping head, stops feeding and ruminating, and mucus flows from the nose; a hard swelling is found inside both ears. The same drench is given as to the horse, and the ears fired in a circle round the roots.\n\nSheep have greatly increased in numbers, especially in the Thal, where they are displacing camels and even horned cattle, and it would be difficult to imagine a country better adapted for sheep raising than those wide dry plains, with plenty of ranging ground over them.\n\nThe genuine Shahpur sheep stands about 30 inches high and 26 to 27 in girth, but as compared with English sheep, Leicester or Southdowns, is a leggy animal. The chief distinguishing points are a curved (i.e., Roman) nose, small muzzle, broad forehead, very long drooping ears, sometimes 13 or 14 inches in length, eyes set back inside of face, tail short and small. The wool fine and of a fairly long staple, the ears, face and legs generally black, and often the wool is partly colored. Males are sold for Rs. 6 or less; females for Rs. 7 or less. Dumbas or fat-tailed sheep of medium size are found in the Salt Range; in some of them the size of the tail amounts to a deformity. Mr. Nunn saw one the tail of which measured over two feet across at the broadest part, and was so heavy that when lying down, the animal could not rise without assistance, and was told that from the tail of a similar sheep that had been killed, over 80 pounds of fat had been taken. The dumba if crossed with the Thal sheep loses all its characteristics in about the third generation. The male lambs are castrated at 6 months old, and are sold as yearling wethers to dealers who come from all parts of country to buy them. Many are taken to Rawalpindi and other cantonments for commissariat purposes. Sheep are shorn twice a year at the beginning and end of the hot weather and give about three-eighths of a seer of wool each time in the Bar, and double that quantity in the Thal. The white wool of the Thal is famous for its fine quality and sells uncleaned at about Rs. 20 per maund, and cleaned at Rs. 30. Ordinarily 2 ram\u2019s fleeces (pothi), or 3 ewe\u2019s fleeces are sold for a rupee. The head-quarters of the trade in Thal wool is Nurpur whence a large quantity is annually exported towards Mult\u00e1n and Karachi, and where a good quality of blanket (loi) is made. The wool of the Bar is largely consumed at Bhera where it is made into felt (namda). A good sheep fetches Rs. 8, and a good ram Rs. 17. Sheep often die in large numbers of epidemic disease, and are subject to that form of splenic apoplexy or anthrax (pharikki) which is common.\nly known as \"braxy\" in Scotland. A sheep's skin fetches anything up to 1 rupee.\n\nGoats.*\u2014The Salt Range breed are very large goats with long hair and long spiral horns, very like small Markhor in appearance. These give up to about 4 seers of milk. Females sell at about Rs. 7, males at about Rs. 5, but occasionally much higher prices are obtained.\n\nThe Thal breed are small goats with small horns generally black or piebald. Females fetch up to Rs. 6, males up to Rs. 5.\n\nThe Burberry Goats are large and leggy, generally red or shewbald in colour, with short hair and small ears and horns. They are great milkers, sometimes giving up to 5 or 6 seers of milk. The females sometimes sell for as much as Rs. 40. They are numerous in the canal area, and were brought there originally from Sialkot.\n\nThere is a breed of Burberry type in the Sin Il\u00e1qua (probably descended from imported Burberrys) which gives up to about 4\u00bd seers of milk. The females fetch up to Rs. 1\u00bd, males up to Rs. 6.\n\nGoat skins fetch anything up to Rs. 1-8-0 a piece.\n\nGoats are shorn once a year at the end of the cold season, and give 3-8ths of a seer of hair (jatt), which sells at 2 or 3 seers per rupee, giving 2 or 3 annas per goat per annum. It is made into ropes and coarse cloth used for nose bags for horses and for camel saddles.\n\nThe Civil Veterinary Department in Shahpur is included in the North Punjab Circle, the head-quarters of which are at Rawalpindi.\n\nIt consists of one Veterinary Inspector with head-quarters at Shahpur, who divides his time between this district and Mianwali and five Veterinary Assistants, one being an itinerating man who works in the whole district, and one man in charge of each of the Veterinary hospitals at Shahpur, Bhera, Sahiw\u00e1l and Khush\u00e1b.\n\n*Mr. Wilson distinguished the following breeds:\n\nI. Bhalt, a very large goat, standing 36 inches high, with long hair and long narrow ears, one measured being 13 inches.\n\nII. Hajirian, which are much the same except that the ears are broader and the teats are very small; this sort of goat is the best milker.\n\nIII. Boji, a small goat with very small ears.\n\nIV. Barbal\u00ed, which is very rare. This is not an indigenous breed, but from time to time has been brought up from Sindh by boatmen on their return from voyages to Sukkur and down the Indus; it is a very small species, not more than 18 to 20 inches high, with small ears and horns, very slight-limbed, and black and tan in color.\n\nV. Munja or bulna, a small black and tan colored goat with short ears and horns. Goats of this breed have a most extraordinary cutaneous appendage from each side of the neck, growing out of the jugular channel, about the size of one's finger, and from 5 to 6 inches long.\nThe work of this department consists of the management and supervision of Veterinary hospitals, arrangement for the checking and prevention of contagious disease (inoculation), supervision of cattle-breeding \u2014 bulls are provided by the District Board, and the Civil Veterinary Department give practical advice and assistance in castrating surplus and inferior males), \u2014 assistance in the general management of cattle fairs, the general supervision of Government animals except horse and donkey stallions which are at present under the Army Remount Department), the collection and tabulation of statistics regarding contagious disease and mortality, and any work of a professional nature which they may be called on to do by their own department or the district authorities.\n\nThe district has always been one of the best in the Punjab for the breeding of horses and ponies; the local breed known as Anmol or \u2018priceless\u2019 is one of which any district might be proud. Even at last settlement there were over 600 branded mares, served by about a dozen Government stallions, and producing about 125 colts and fillies annually. The wealthier Tiwana Maliks, the Nuns, and the Mekans all maintained good studs, and most of the well-to-do owners had one or two good mares. In the parts of the district where these mares were to be found at settlement, the position is much as it was; the District Board maintains eleven stallions and eight donkey stallions, and 671 branded mares produced 189 colts and fillies to them. But these figures are entirely overshadowed by the results of the horse-breeding scheme which is one of the principal features of the Lower Jhelum Colony. The general outlines of the scheme and the results up to date are as follows:\n\nThe majority of the colonists, both Civil and Military, are obliged by the conditions of their grants to keep up a mare for every unit of grant (2 squares in the case of peasant grantees, and 1\u00bd squares in the case of yeomen and stud farm grantees): the mare must be regularly covered by a Government stallion, and Government holds a lien on the progeny till 18 months of age. In the event of the mare dying, the owner must replace her within 3 months. The work of branding and registering colony mares was made over by the Civil Veterinary to the Army Remount Department in September 1902, and 5 stallion stables were complete and occupied in May 1903; close co-operation between the Irrigation, Colonization and Remount officers had the excellent result that Government was able to provide stallions as soon as the earliest colonists had procured their mares and settled on their lands. Since then there has been parallel ex-\npansion of irrigation, colonization and breeding, and there are now 14 stallion stands so distributed that no horse-breeding colonist has to travel more than 5 or 6 miles to get his mare covered. The sanctioned strength of stallions in the circle is 160, and the actual number standing in 1915 is shown in the margin. In the first year (1903-04) 1,488 mares were covered and 563 foals produced. In 1913-14, 3,499 mares were covered and 1,968 foals produced; it is worth remarking that in that year (the latest for which the figures are published) the percentage of foals to coverings (56\u00b724 per cent.) was as good as that obtained by the King's premium stallions in England. The extent to which the Indian Army is benefited may be judged from the figures quoted; it is considered that a standard of at least 500 foals fit for Departmental purchase in the year should be worked up to, but the quality of the foals is said to be improving year by year.\n\n| Year | Number of Foals Purchased |\n|------|--------------------------|\n|      | By Army Remount Department | By Indian Cavalry Regiments |\n| 1910-11 | 369 | 117 |\n| 1911-12 | 402 | 112 |\n| 1912-13 | 374 | 122 |\n| 1913-14 | 377 | 79 |\n| 1914-15 | 438 | 86 |\n\nIt has been now fully established that the horse-breeding conditions are working most satisfactorily; the only condition which gave any real trouble was that which required the colonist to replace a deceased mare within three months; the inevitable difficulties were met partly by the Remount Department consenting to relinquish its lien on fillies required for replacement purposes, and partly by the grant of Government loans for the purchase of replacements, and these two concessions are combined into one scheme by the Remount officers, in such a way that all mares will be eventually replaced by pedigree-animals bred in the Colony while the price of replacements is officially fixed so as to satisfy both buyer and seller. Thus in 1911-12, 509 mares were replaced, and 298 colonists received Rs. 50,000 in loans for this purpose. It can easily be understood that this system is extremely popular. It is recognized, both by Government and by the colonists, that the great success which has attended horse-breeding in the Jhelum Colony is mainly due to Major C. Templer, the first Remount Officer, and Mr. W. M. Hailey, the Colonization Officer who between them organized the earliest operations and surmounted\nthe initial difficulties; to Major J. Bruce, who succeeded Major Templer, and ensured the maintenance of the scheme at a time when the colonists were inclined to think more of their privileges than of their responsibilities; and to Major H. F. Gordon, who has during the past five years succeeded, by his great tact and personal popularity, in convincing the colonists that the scheme benefits them no less than Government.\n\nBetween 2 and 3 miles from the Civil Station is situated the Remount Depot, lying to the left of the Sargodha-Shahpur Road on the right bank of the Northern Branch of the Lower Jhelum Canal. It comprises an area of 10,000 acres.\n\nThe object of the Remount Depot, which was officially opened in April 1907, is to receive young country-bred horses and mules bred in the various horses and mule breeding districts of the Punjab, United Provinces and Baluchistan, and to run them, until old enough to be issued, to the Army in India. Horses are issued to British Cavalry and Non-Silladar Cavalry Regiments; mules are issued to Mountain Batteries, Sapper and Miner units, Infantry Regiments for carrying Machine Guns, Pioneer Regiments for entrenching tools and to the supply and Transport Corps as baggage and cart mules.\n\nThe complement of animals during normal times is 1,500 horses and 1,400 mules, which has been considerably exceeded during the present war.\n\nExtensive farming operations are carried on and the Depot is self-supporting with regard to all fodder except bhoosa. Among other crops, sufficient oats have been produced for the last five years to make the Depot independent of the outside market with regard to this grain.\n\nThe staff consists of a Superintendent and his Assistant drawn from British Officers of the Indian Cavalry; a Veterinary Officer of the Army Veterinary Corps and a Medical Officer of the Indian Subordinate Medical Department. There is a subordinate European staff of five British Warrant and Non-Commissioned Officers selected from the mounted branches, a subordinate veterinary establishment, an office establishment and a menial establishment of about 1,000 souls consisting of artificers, farm hands, and syces. Major E. Hagger has been Superintendent from the opening of the Depot up till now.\n\nBefore 1904 one horse show used to be held at Shahpur for the whole district. It was managed by the District Board under the control of the Civil Veterinary Department. After\nthat year owing to the development of horse-breeding in the Lower Jhelum Canal Colony a separate fair was held at Sargodha.\n\nBoth these fairs are under the control of the Army Remount Department and up to 1909 were held separately. In 1909 the number of animals attending the fair at Shahpur was so small that in 1910, on the advice of the Superintendent, Army Remount Department, it was amalgamated with the Sargodha Fair. In 1911, on the representation of the horsebreeders of the old part of the district, a separate fair was again held at Shahpur, but it was abandoned in 1914 only to be reintroduced in 1916.\n\nAt the Shahpur fair, only horses from the old portion of the district compete, and at Sargodha, only horses from the Colony area. The latter fair from the horse-breeding and purchasing point of view is the best and most important fair in India.\n\nPrizes are given from imperial funds at both the fairs, while at Shahpur separate prizes are also given by the District Board for the produce of its stallions.\n\nThe judging is done by the special Judging Committee, nominated by the Quartermaster-General in India, with the Deputy Commissioner of the district as President. The general expenses of both the fairs are met from District Board funds, to which the income is also credited.\n\nStatements A and B attached show the number of animals attending each fair, the number sold and the value of the prizes awarded.\n\nAt these fairs, cattle are also shown and prizes are given by the District Board to encourage cattle-breeding.\n\nSports of various kinds are also held at both fairs to attract people and popularize the fairs. The following events are generally held.\n\nTent-pegging by individuals, and by sections; Pirkaudis Saunchi Races; Tug of war; Jugglers.\n\nThe winners are given prizes by the District Board.\n###

The history of these wells is given below. Their importance has now been dwarfed by the development of canal irrigation. The canal irrigated area, which was nil at regular settlement, had risen to 87,654 acres in 1893; and is now 785,805* acres. Canal irrigation is of three distinct kinds:\u2014(1) inundation (104,823 acres) which depends on the seasonal rise and fall of the rivers, and gives water for the sowing and maturing of khar\u00edf crops, and the sowing of the rabi, with a very occasional watering for the ripening crop. Experience has shewn that if plenty of water is given in August or September, the rabi crop on the inundation canals will come to maturity with hardly any rainfall; but most of the land irrigated by these canals would go out of cultivation if it failed to get first watering from them owing to the alkali in the soil: (2) perennial (673,789 acres) which is entirely dependent on the Lower Jhelum Canal for the sowing and maturing of all crops: here failure of supply almost always means failure of crop: (3) six-monthly (5,716 acres) which is confined to two distributaries of the perennial canal in the Jhelum Valley near S\u00e1h\u00edw\u00e1l: here the system is very similar to the inundation system, but owing to the stiff clayey nature of the soil commanded, it is necessary to keep the distributaries in flow for at least 8 months in order to ensure the ripening of the crops.\n\nThere was practically no canal irrigation in the district until in 1860 Mr. Macnabb, Deputy Commissioner, cleared out at his own expense an old river channel which developed into the canal called after him the Macnabbw\u00e1h, and induced Malik\n\n---\n\n*This figure includes 1,477 acres of \"\u00e1b\u00e1\" land on perennial streams, but does not include 23,438 acres of ch\u00e1h\u00ed-mahri, which depend even more on the canals than on the wells.\nS\u00e1hib Kh\u00e1n, Tiw\u00e1na, to excavate a large canal to irrigate a grant of waste land given him at K\u00e1lra. The profits secured were so great that numerous other canals were soon after constructed, some by the State and others by private persons, and although several of these have since been abandoned or absorbed in others there are now in existence 4 State and 12 private inundation canals, more or less in working order. The State canals are (1) the Station Canal and (2) the S\u00e1hiw\u00e1l Canal, both in the Shahpur Tahs\u00edl, the latter of which has now absorbed the Maenabbw\u00e1h and the old S\u00e1hiw\u00e1l Canal, (3) the R\u00e1n\u00edw\u00e1h in the Bhera Tahs\u00edl, and (4) the Corbynw\u00e1h in the Khush\u00e1b Tahs\u00edl. The Station Canal (which really consists of two separate canals, known as the Eastern and Western Station Canals) and the S\u00e1hiw\u00e1l Canal are the property of the Imperial Government. The R\u00e1n\u00edw\u00e1h and Corbynw\u00e1h are Provincial.\n\nIn 1870 the Imperial Government purchased the Station Canal, the Maenabbw\u00e1h, and the old S\u00e1hiw\u00e1l Canal from Local Funds for Rs. 20,610. Between 1877 and 1880 the capital outlay was raised to Rs. 40,739; between 1891 and 1893 this was again raised to Rs. 1,36,867, and in 1893 these canals had brought in a clear profit of Rs. 53,501 over and above all charges for capital outlay, and working expenses, and were paying 28 per cent. on the capital outlay.\n\nIn 1914-15 the capital account stood at Rs. 2,15,914; for that year the gross receipts were Rs. 1,16,689, working expenses Rs. 50,207, and nett revenue Rs. 66,482, giving a return of over 30 per cent. The average return for the 27 preceding years was 21 per cent and the net revenue to date was Rs. 10,63,191, which gives a clear profit of Rs. 8,47,277. Even if interest charges also are allowed for the nett profit is Rs. 6,64,913.\n\nThe work done by these canals, and the cost of the water to the cultivators, can be judged from the following figures:\n\n| Area Irrigated, acres | 1905-07 | 1908-10 | 1911-13 | Year 1914-15 |\n|-----------------------|---------|---------|---------|-------------|\n| Area Matured and Assessed, acres | 32,154 | 38,180 | 36,588 | 43,697 |\n| Total Assessments, direct and indirect, Rs. | 66,662 | 96,555 | 97,259 | 1,12,857 |\n| Occupiers' Rates, Rs. | 54,059 | 81,592 | 81,207 | 94,295 |\nThe value of the crops raised in 1914-15 is estimated at Rs. 11,90,428.\n\nThe R\u00e1n\u00edw\u00e1h was originally excavated in 1870 by the Deputy Commissioner with the aid of tak\u00e1vi advances to the amount of Rs. 19,500, and the income of the canal in the first year of its running was Rs. 5,642 and in the second Rs. 19,070. The tak\u00e1vi advances were paid off and in the third year after the commencement of the canal the capital cost was extinguished and Government was in possession of a canal which had cost it nothing, capable of irrigating 6,000 acres and having a net revenue of Rs. 7,000 per annum. Since then the canal has been considerably extended, out of revenue. In 1893, the net profit had amounted to Rs. 3,80,000. For purposes of accounts this canal is now amalgamated with the Corbrynw\u00e1h, so it is impossible to say exactly what the profits to date have been on it alone. For the last 10 years the nett income has averaged Rs. 19,390 as against Rs. 25,129 for the 13 years ending 1893, so it would seem that the increased expenditure has hardly been justified by results. The gross income varied between Rs. 33,867 in 1911-12 and Rs. 1,13,022 in 1914-15.\n\nThe Corbrynw\u00e1h Canal in the Khush\u00e1b Tahsil was originally made in 1879 by Captain Corbyn, Deputy Commissioner, at the cost of the District Board and Khush\u00e1b Municipal Committee but finally in 1891 was acquired by the Provincial Government, together with Malik Sher Muhammad Kh\u00e1n\u2019s Canal alongside which it ran. The capital cost of the combined canal to Government is estimated at Rs. 38,671, including Rs. 13,671 spent on improvements after the acquisition. During the five years ending 1892 it irrigated on the average 2,428 acres, had an income of Rs. 1,959 and an expenditure of Rs. 1,019, and brought in a net profit of Rs. 940 per annum. During the 10 years ending 1914-15 irrigation averaged about 7,000 acres (most of it only grass): the average income was Rs. 4,508, expenditure Rs. 1,831 and nett revenue Rs. 2,977. It is a poor canal in every way, but much better than nothing for the villages it commands.\n\nNo capital account is now kept for these Provincial Canals but in 1914-15 the balance of net revenue on the two combined was Rs. 2,61,598, the total receipts to date being Rs. 10,05,675 and the total charges Rs. 7,44,077. For the year 1914-15, the gross receipts were Rs. 58,156, the working expenses Rs. 42,083 and the nett revenue Rs. 16,067, which was slightly less than the average of the preceding 15 years.\nThe working of the Provincial Canals in recent years has been as follows:\n\n| Average of Triennium | Year 1914-15 |\n|----------------------|--------------|\n|                      | 1905-07      | 1908-10     | 1911-13     |\n| Area irrigated, acres| 24,231       | 26,601      | 27,784      | 30,361      |\n| Area matured and assessed, acres | 19,920 | 24,719 | 25,861 | 28,817 |\n| Total assessments, direct and indirect, Rs | 40,534 | 49,946 | 54,115 | 59,125 |\n| Occupiers' rates, Rs | 32,749 | 40,871 | 44,188 | 47,977 |\n\nThe value of the crops raised in 1914-15 is estimated at Rs. 6,22,147.\n\nThe private canals now in existence are as follows:\n\n| No. | River | Name of Canal | Approximate area irrigated |\n|-----|-------|---------------|---------------------------|\n| 1   | Jhelum | Pir\u00e1nw\u00e1la     | 2,400                     |\n| 2   | Ditto  | N\u00fan\u00e1nw\u00e1la     | 5,500                     |\n| 3   | Ditto  | Sult\u00e1n Mahm\u00fadw\u00e1la | 6,500               |\n| 4   | Ditto  | Chah\u00e1r\u00e1m\u00ed     | 700                       |\n| 5   | Ditto  | S\u00e1hib Kh\u00e1nw\u00e1la | 13,500                   |\n| 6   | Ditto  | Mek\u00e1n\u00e1nw\u00e1la   | 4,500                     |\n| 7   | Ditto  | Chillw\u00e1la or Jah\u00e1n Kh\u00e1n W\u00e1la | 7,500         |\n| 8   | Ditto  | Sarfr\u00e1z Kh\u00e1nw\u00e1la | 4,500                 |\n| 9   | Ditto  | Jhammat\u00e1nw\u00e1la | 200                       |\n| 10  | Ditto  | Nath\u00faw\u00e1la     | 0                         |\n| 11  | Ditto  | Kand\u00e1nw\u00e1la or Mughl\u00e1nw\u00e1la | 100                  |\n| 12  | Ditto  | T\u00fat\u00e1nw\u00e1la or Megha | 100                |\nThis area is approximately the average irrigated in a normal series of years, the maximum irrigation being considerably more. Besides the Malik Sher Muhammad Canal bought up and absorbed in the Corbynw\u00e1h, as already mentioned, the Jah\u00e1n Kh\u00e1nw\u00e1la in Bhera was purchased by the Provincial Government some years ago for Rs. 5,000 and absorbed in the R\u00e1n\u00edw\u00e1h, and the Mahotew\u00e1la was purchased by the Imperial Government for Rs. 1,200, and absorbed in the S\u00e1hiw\u00e1l Canal. Two other Jhelum Canals, the Am\u00edr Chandw\u00e1la and the Nabbew\u00e1la, which at one time irrigated about 100 acres apiece, have not been in working order for many years. Three canals on the Chenab, irrigating about 1,500 acres between them, have also ceased to work. A detailed history of these canals will be found in Mr. Wilson's assessment reports on Bhera and Shahpur Tahsils, and they have been exhaustively discussed from all points of view in connection with the proposal to supersede all inundation canals by the Shahpur Branch, which is described below.\n\nThe schedule of occupiers' rates in force on the Imperial and Provincial Inundation Canals is as follows:\n\n|                      | Corbynw\u00e1h | All Other Canals |\n|----------------------|-----------|------------------|\n|                      | Flow      | Lift             | Flow     | Lift   |\n|                      | Rs.

The accounts produced by various owners show that the average value of this income is about Rs. 4-8-0 per acre matured, or very nearly double the flow rate of Rs. 2-8-0 per acre on the State Canals. For lift irrigation the owners of private canals generally charge from Rs. 16 to Rs. 22 on each jhal\u00e1r or Persian wheel erected on the bank of the canal and on chahi-nahri lands they generally take 1/5th or 1/6th share. In some cases the owners of the land through which\na private canal passes are entitled to the irrigation of a certain area free in return for their having given the land over which the canal passes\u2014a source of frequent dispute and litigation.\n\nBesides the water rate, a water-advantage rate is levied on all land irrigated by inundation canals, whether State or Private, at the rate of one rupee per acre of crops matured; and on all land irrigated by private canals an additional royalty rate of 12 annas per acre is charged to the owner of the canal, by way of asserting the right of the State to the water in the rivers.\n\nThe main features of the Lower Jhelum Canal system have already been described in Chapter I. The total area commanded in this district is 966,407 acres, and of this 501,542 acres are supposed to be irrigated annually. As a matter of fact, in 1914-15, 680,696 acres, belonging to 587 estates, were actually irrigated (194,358 acres in the kharif, and 486,338 acres in the rabi) and 666,161 acres were actually assessed. Out of the total area commanded 479,000 acres are still the property of Government; 42,727 acres have not yet been allotted; of the 436,273 acres allotted to colonists or earmarked for public purposes, 392,957 acres are cultivated and 398,914 acres were irrigated in 1914-15.\n\nIrrigation first began in 1901, but only in a very haphazard way and no occupiers' rates were levied in that year. The various assessment circles obtained a regular supply in the harvests noted against each, but a series of misfortunes retarded development, and it is only since recently that the canal can be considered to have been working at full pressure. The figures of area in this district for the past five years are as follows:\n\n| Area          | 1910-11 | 1911-12 | 1912-13 | 1913-14 | 1914-15 |\n|---------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Acres         |         |         |         |         |         |\n| Area irrigated| 628,374 | 666,910 | 685,514 | 680,550 | 680,696 |\n| Area assessed | 561,253 | 587,091 | 656,846 | 669,235 | 666,161 |\n\nUp to the end of 1914-15 the capital account of the Lower Jhelum Canal as a whole stood at Rs 1,55,62,968; the net revenue to date, after deducting interest charges and all other working...\nexpenses, was Rs. 1,11,13,358. The return on capital for the year, after deducting interest charges, was 18\u00b738 per cent.; the value of the crops raised was estimated at Rs. 2,69,62,302; occupiers' rates amounted to Rs. 27,51,571, with an incidence of 3\u00b744 per acre assessed. Whether this pitch of prosperity will be maintained depends largely on the effects of the Tripal Canal Project.\n\nGrave fears are now entertained lest the alteration in the winter-supply necessitated by the opening of the Upper Jhelum Canal may seriously reduce the matured areas. The Irrigation Officers hold that the cultivators will have no difficulty in adjusting themselves to an intermittent supply in the cold weather, either by putting a larger proportion of the land under kharif crops, or by adopting methods of cultivation better calculated to conserve moisture. It remains to be seen whether the colonists have the requisite adaptability.\n\nThe Gondal and S\u00e1hiw\u00e1l distributaries do not run for more than 8 or 9 months in the year, the reason being that they command villages in which the spring level is so near the surface as to threaten water-logging. The area commanded by these distributaries is only 5,716 acres, and only 3,125 acres are matured from them on an average of years. These areas are included in those given above for the Lower Jhelum Canal.\n\nWhen first the Triple Canal Project was sanctioned, it was apprehended that the working of the inundation canals might be seriously impaired, and it was suggested that it would be wise to anticipate trouble by constructing a kharif distributary of the Lower Jhelum Canal, to supersede them. All sorts of opinions were expressed by various Canal and Revenue Officers, but eventually, in 1906, the main channel was actually dug from Chak Raib, near Malakw\u00e1l, on the main line to Saidal, near Jhawari\u00e1n from which point the Branch was to coincide with the Western Station Canal, tailing into the S\u00e1hiw\u00e1l Canal just north of Shahpur. It was then found to be impossible to arrange satisfactory terms with the owners of the private canals: they were utterly unwilling to link up their canals with the Branch, except on terms which made the whole scheme financially impossible. After years of correspondence and negotiation, they refused, in April 1916, to accept an offer of irrigation for all their own lands at a rate equivalent to their usual expenditure on upkeep, maintenance, and royalty, and the right to collect a quarter share in kind on all lands on which they had previously done so, on payment of the same rate. It is understood that the Branch will now be definitely abandoned, and the eight lakhs of rupees already spent on it may be considered almost a dead loss.\nThe Lower Jhelum Canal Circle is in charge of a Superintending Engineer, whose head-quarters were in 1916 moved from Jhelum to Sargodha. Under him are three Executive Engineers each in charge of a division. The First Division has its headquarters at Ras\u00fal and includes the Main Line, and 4 of its major distributaries with a total distributary mileage, major and minor, of 34 miles; it also includes the two Provincial Canals. The Second Division has its head-quarters at Sargodha and includes 1 distributary of the Main Line, 21 distributaries of the Northern Branch, 32 distributaries of the Southern Branch and Khadir feeder, and 16 distributaries of the Southern feeder; the total mileage is 394 miles; it also includes the Imperial Inundation Canals. The Third Division also has its head-quarters at Sargodha and includes 41 distributaries of the Northern Branch, 9 of the Southern Branch, and 17 of the Sulki Branch, with a total mileage of 502 miles. The kharif distributaries are in this division.\n\nThe occupiers\u2019 rates now in force on the Lower Jhelum Canal are in two schedules. Schedule B applies to (1) all villages in Bhera Tahs\u00edl irrigated from the Kh\u00e1dir Feeder or Distributary; (2) all villages in Shahpur Tahs\u00edl, except (a) Vegow\u00e1l and (b) villages irrigated from the S\u00e1hiw\u00e1l feeder and kharif distributaries; (3) the following Chaks in Sargodha Tahs\u00edl: Nothern Branch\u2014Nos. 89, 93, 94, 95, 103, 104, 105, 108, 110, 112, 115 to 174 inclusive; Southern Branch\u2014Nos. 60, 61, 63, 131, 133, 134, 135, 137 to 141, and Chak Jodh.

But the average chahi area per well is now only 20\u00bd acres, instead of 34, and the area of chahi crops 19 acres, instead of 25. It has already been shown that the chahi area has dropped from 236,524 acres to 137,365. Moreover out of this total, 23,485 acres are chahi-nahri, and would probably go out of cultivation at once, if they failed to get their first waterings from the canals, owing to the water being brackish. It has been shewn in Chapter I, Section A, how the canal has supplanted the wells in the Chenab Circle and the Ara. It is only in the Jhelum valley and the S\u00fcn basin that the wells are really important now.\n\nFacility of irrigation from wells depends (1) on the quality of the water, (2) on its depth below the surface, (3) on the continuity of the supply. In the river valleys and those parts of the B\u00e4r uplands which adjoin them the subsurface water is almost everywhere sweet; there is, however, a noteworthy exception in a belt of land running along the drainages known as R\u00e1n\u00edw\u00e1h and Didh\u00e1r, where the subsoil water is impregnated with salt to such an extent as to injure the crops in dry years; there is some reason to believe that in this tract the effect of the spread of canal irrigation across these drainages has been to increase the saltiness of the well water, and the state of the crops\nirrigated from wells in that area should be watched. In the B\u00e1r uplands far from the rivers the water in the wells is often brackish and unsuitable for irrigation. In the plains portion of the Khush\u00e1b Tahs\u00edl, except in the narrow strip immediately along the river, the subsoil water is so impregnated with salt as to be quite useless for purposes of irrigation and in many places undrinkable, so that irrigation from wells in that large tract is almost unknown. In the Salt Range the subsoil water in the basins of the valleys is generally sweet, even close to the margin of the Salt Lake of Uchh\u00e1li. As for the depth to water, that naturally increases as one goes away from the channels of the rivers, even in greater proportion than the rise of the land surface above sea-level. In the river valleys the depth to water varies from about 15 feet near the river to about 30 feet near the edge of the B\u00e1r upland. The introduction of canal irrigation has had a marked effect in raising the water-level in the Jhelum Circle, where in many places instead of 200 pots on the Persian-wheel only 150 or less are now required; this effect has been greatly enhanced by the record flood of July 1893, since which the subsoil level at the old head-quarters station has risen to within 6 feet of the surface and the foundations of some of the buildings threaten to subside. In the B\u00e1r uplands the depth to water varies from 40 to 55 feet. In the Thal the depth to water is 55 feet or more.\n\nThe continuity of the supply of water depends on the nature of the substrata; in many parts of the district there is a substratum of water-bearing sand through which water percolates regularly and rapidly into the well. This is called the sach, and the success of a well depends on whether it has been sunk far enough to reach this stratum. If the sach has not been reached the water is soon exhausted and the well cannot be constantly worked, so that the area it irrigates is small. In the Chenab valley as a rule the sach is better the farther one goes from the river, and the wells near the river are more easily exhausted and irrigate a smaller area than those towards the B\u00e1r.\n\nAlmost everywhere in the district the wells are made of burnt brick set, not in mortar, but in mud, and so good is the subsoil that such wells last for many years. In the B\u00e1r such wells practically last for ever, and many old wells made by the former inhabitants centuries ago were, before the canal came, dug out, repaired and set going. The site of such a well is sometimes discovered by noticing that goats will not sit over it. The cost of a well depends chiefly on the depth to water and varies from Rs. 150 near the river to Rs. 700 or more inland.\nAn ordinary well in the river valleys may be taken as costing about Rs. 400 besides the peasant's labour. In the hills the cost varies from Rs. 400 to Rs. 1,000 according to the extent to which dressed stone is used.\n\nWhen a site is to be chosen for a new well the land-owner calls together his friends and procures Re. 1-4-0 worth of gur. The experienced men among them consult as to what would be a good place, and select if possible ground raised slightly above the level of the land to be irrigated. They try to get a site towards the north, as it is found by experience that water flows better to the south than to the north! This idea is probably due to the general slope of the country being southwards. It is also found that water does more work when it flows nearly level with the ground than when it flows at a higher level. When the site has been chosen a blessing is prayed for (dua kher akhi), a potful of water is poured on the place, and a lump of the gur put on it. Then the most respectable men present take a spade (kah\u00ed), and all holding it together strike it into the ground to mark the spot chosen (thappa m\u00e4rna); the younger men then commence the excavation and the rest of the gur is distributed.\n\nThe universal means of irrigation from wells is the Persian wheel, the wood-work of which costs about Rs. 60 or 70. Sometimes this apparatus is set up on the bank of the canal or of a branch of the river, when it is called a jhal\u00e1r. The rope-and-bucket apparatus is used only for the purpose of raising drinking-water from the deep wells in the Thal. The cost of irrigation depends chiefly on the depth to water. Nowadays there is little well-cultivation, except where the water-table is reasonably high, but twenty years ago, things were different.\n\n\"In the river valleys small bullocks are strong enough to work the wheel, but in the deep wells of the B\u00e1r, where the wheel carries 40 pots, only the strongest cattle can work the well, and male buffaloes are most generally used, often costing Rs. 60 or more each. Here a well in full work requires 18 buffaloes, giving three pairs to each third of a well, and the owners of a well, sometimes six or ten in number, generally get tenants to join them for the season, the produce of the irrigated land being divided between them in proportion to the number of buffaloes supplied by each.\"\n\nEven now, in the Thal circle, the cattle have to be sturdy, and cannot draw enough water for more than 7 acres from one well.\n\nIn other circles also it is common for a number of land-owners to have shares in a well, but there it is usual for each sharer to work the well for a period corresponding to his share, irrigating his own land from the well for that period.\nThe area ordinarily cultivated with the aid of irrigation from a well varies greatly in different parts of the district, and so does the area annually harvested per well. For the whole district the average area so attached to a well is $20\\frac{1}{2}$ acres, and the average area of irrigated crops actually harvested is 19 acres. The extremes are found in the Ara circle where 54 acres are on the average attached to a well, but only 24 acres give a crop in the year, and in the Salt Range where the area attached to a well averages only $2\\frac{1}{2}$ acres but produces nearly 4 acres of irrigated crops annually.\n\nThe nature of the crops grown on a well varies considerably in the different tracts, and has been described in the various assessment reports. For instance in the Jhelum Circle of Tahsil Shahpur a well on the average gives annually 20 acres of crop, of which 3 acres are grown in the kharif and 17 in the rabi. The kharif crop includes 1 acre of fodder, 1 acre of bajra, $\\frac{1}{2}$ acre of cotton, and $\\frac{1}{2}$ acre of maize, china, sugarcane or rice, and the rabi crop 11 acres of wheat, $\\frac{1}{2}$ acre of barley, half an acre of other grains, $3\\frac{1}{2}$ acres of turnips, carrots and other vegetables, 1 acre of miscellaneous fodder and half an acre of melons or tobacco.\n\nIn the Bhera-Jhelum Circle, there are 19 acres of matured crop, $4\\frac{1}{2}$ in the kharif and $14\\frac{1}{2}$ in the rabi. 2 acres will be under bajra with a little jowar; $\\frac{1}{2}$ an acre will be devoted to fodder, and of the remaining 2 acres, about one-third will be under cotton, an equal area under maize, and the remainder will produce even more valuable crops\u2014sugarcane, mehdi, and spices: in the rabi 10 acres will produce wheat, and another acre will be given up to other food-grains and oil-seeds: $2\\frac{1}{2}$ acres will be set aside for turnips and other fodder, and the remaining acre will yield tobacco and other high-priced crops. In the Khush\u00e1b-Jhelum Circle there are only 18 acres of matured crop, $3\\frac{1}{2}$ in the kharif and $14\\frac{1}{2}$ in the rabi; these will be:\u2014jowar and bajra, 1 acre; other food-grains, $\\frac{1}{2}$ acre; cotton, $\\frac{1}{2}$ acre; fodder, 1 acre; miscellaneous, $\\frac{1}{2}$ acre; wheat, 10 acres; fodder and turnips, $2\\frac{1}{2}$ acres; melons, tobacco, etc., 1 acre.\n\nThe water that has been poured on to the Jech-Do\u00e1b since 1901 has had a very marked effect upon the spring-level, and consequently upon the amount of labour required to lift a given volume of water from a well. The Canal Department have been carefully recording the extent of the rise, and the result for three typical sections is given below: line IX is a section through Bhera town and the off-take of the Chenab escape; line XI\nroughly coincides with the western boundary of Bhera Tahsil, and line XIII is a section through Shahpur and Sargodha towns:\n\n| Section | Period of which average is taken | Depth Below Ground Level of the Water Surface in Feet |\n|---------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n|         | Chenab bank | Buddhi nala | Foot of nakka | Top of nakka | Highest part of the Bar | Foot of Danda | Jhelum bank |\n| Line IX | 1899\u20141903   | 20'45       | 30'5          | 47'69       | 61'99                   | 73'17        | 26'84      | 10'79     |\n|         | 1909\u20141913   | 15'48       | 18'97         | 26'62       | 41'22                   | 47'66        | 15'15      | 8'31      |\n| Line XI | 1899\u20141903   | 15'92       | 21'84         | 54'26       | 69'21                   | 68'03        | 10'60      | 14'99     |\n|         | 1909\u20141913   | 11'98       | 13'16         | 37'85       | 51'60                   | 51'30        | 5'67       | 12'58     |\n| Line XIII | 1899\u20141903   | 23'63      | 33'86         | 43'58       | 65'46                   | 68'82        | 11'70      | 15'74     |\n|         | 1909\u20141913   | 18'0        | 25'94         | 29'43       | 51'20                   | 55'49        | 6'28       | 13'63     |\n\nSection B.\u2014Rents, Wages, and Prices.\n\nOf the total cultivated area of the district about 58 per cent. is held by tenants-at-will paying rents in cash or in kind to the owner or colonist. Cash-rents are paid on 7 per cent. and kind-rents on 51 per cent. The most important factor in the relation of landlord and tenant is the rapid development of cultivation in the Western Punjab, and the consequent demand for more tenants in this and several other districts. This puts the tenant in a very strong position, and, especially on wells and inundation canals, the landlord has to put up with very careless cultivation and the devotion of large areas to fodder crops for the maintenance of the tenants\u2019 numerous cattle. It is only where there are unusual advantages of soil or water-supply, or where the cultivator is bound to the soil by strong ties of sentiment, that any landlord can begin to exact rack-rents.\n\nThe cash-rented area is mainly on the Lower Jhelum Canal; here the size of holdings in the proprietary villages, and the number of absentee landlords, encourage a system of contract under which the lessee pays all Government charges and a fixed rent per square or per kila in addition. It will be seen from Mr. Rudkin\u2019s assessment report on this area that this system is commonest in the proprietary villages, and in the auctioned blocks; and owing to the difficulty of inducing at\nreally good tenant to settle in the midst of cattle-thieves, the former command much lower rents than the latter:\n\n| Circle          | Proprietary lands | Auctioned blocks | Crown lands |\n|-----------------|-------------------|------------------|-------------|\n| Bhera B\u00e1r       | Rs.

But it may be remarked that the range given for Crown lands on the Sargodha Utla Circle is for blocks on the Northern Branch only; on the Southern Branch the range is from Rs. 9 to Rs. 14-8-0, and in some cases more than Rs. 25 is paid. On the other hand, the poor Sobh\u00e1ga lands of the Hethla Circle do not command more than Rs. 3. A good many of these rents date from a time when there was considerable uncertainty as to the productivity of the land and the water-supply. At present, the renting value of average land in the colony is probably about Rs. 10 per acre, exclusive of Government dues.\n\nIn the remainder of the district cash-rents are very exceptional, and are in almost all cases taken by owners who are for some reason prevented from collecting in kind. Details will be found in the assessment reports, but no valid deductions can be based upon the statistics.\n\nBy far the most popular method of fixing rents, all over the district, is the division of the produce according to a fixed share. Before division various deductions are made from the joint heap by the menials and village servants, and in many cases the owner, or the tenant, takes a small proportion on account of certain expenses; and even before the crop is brought on to the threshing-floor it has to submit to deductions on account of fodder cut green by tenant or landlord, or sheaves claimed by reapers, and hinds. All these customary allowances are noted in the record-of-rights, and the share of crop entered as the landlord's due must be understood to mean his share of\nthe heap left for division on the threshing-floor, when they have been extracted.\n\nBy far the commonest share taken by the landlord is a half of the grain and straw: this rate is practically universal on all canal and flood-lands, as well as on the best-embanked fields of the Hill and Mohar circles. On the wells, a half of the grain (sometimes with a small portion of the straw), is generally taken; but on the few wells now remaining in the Ara and the Bhera B\u00e1r, the landlord has still in most cases to be content with one-third. In the Thal one-third of grain and straw is the prevailing rate, but in that circle there is comparatively little tenant-cultivation (14\u00bd per cent. of the total). In the Mohar 37 per cent. of the cultivated area held by tenants pays two-fifths, and 30 per cent. pays one third or less, and in the hills (in some of the weaker estates of the Tappa and Vanhar) 16 per cent. pays two-fifths and two per cent. one-third. Wherever the rate is now less than a half, there is a gradual tendency upwards towards that fraction, and it must, undoubtedly, be considered the normal rate for the district.\n\nBut although the share of produce taken on canal lands is everywhere the same, actual rents vary greatly in value according to the extent to which the landlord is able to saddle the tenant with a share of the Government demands on account of land revenue and water-rent. This is almost entirely a matter of local fashion, and is practically independent of economic considerations. With few exceptions the following rules may be said to hold good:\n\nI.\u2014On the Lower Jhelum Canal (including khar\u00edf distributaries):\n\n(a) in old proprietary villages\u2014the tenant pays half the water-rate, and the landlord pays half the water-rate and all the land revenue. But on 23 per cent. of the cash-rented area in the Bhera B\u00e1r, the tenant pays half the land revenue as well as half the water-rate; while on 27 per cent. of the same area, the landlord pays the whole of the Government dues, but collects a contribution in cash of about Re. 1-4-0 per kila from the tenant.\n\n(b) in colony chaks\u2014the tenant in nearly all cases pays half the water-rate and half the land revenue; but on about 11 per cent. of the Sargodha B\u00e1r Hethla Circle the landlord pays all dues, and the tenant\npays a contribution of anything up to Re. 1-8-0 per kila.\n\nII. On the Imperial Inundation Canals (i.e., the Eastern and Western Station and S\u00e1hiw\u00e1l Canals):\n\n(a) in Jhawari\u00e1n and villages to the east of it\u2014the tenant either pays half the water-rate and half the water-advantage-rate; or else the tenant pays all the water-advantage-rate, and the landlord pays the remaining charges.\n\n(b) wes' of Jhawari\u00e1n\u2014the landlord pays all dues. Altogether on these canals the owner pays 92 per cent. of the water-advantage-rate; 98\u00bd per cent. of the water-rate; and all the fixed land revenue.\n\nIII. On the Provincial Canals (i.e., the R\u00e1n\u00edw\u00e1h and Corbynw\u00e1h):\n\n(a) on the R\u00e1n\u00edw\u00e1h\u2014generally the tenant pays half the water-rate and half the water-advantage-rate; but on 23 per cent. towards the tail of the canal the owner pays all dues.\n\n(b) on the Corbynw\u00e1h\u2014the landlord pays all dues.\n\nIV. On the private canals:\n\n(a) on lands owned by the canal-owner\u2014the owner pays the water-advantage and royalty-rates out of his half-share of the produce.\n\n(b) on lands owned by persons other than the canal-owners\u2014the canal-owner takes one-quarter of the produce (chah\u00e1ram), and pays the royalty-rate. The subsequent adjustment between landlord and tenant is then made as follows:\n\n| Method of adjustment | Bhora | Shahpur and Sargodha |\n|----------------------|-------|----------------------|\n| Landlord takes \u00bd share and pays \u00bd water-advantage-rate | ... | 4,677 |\n| Tenant takes \u00bd share and pays all water-advantage-rate | ... | 3,685 |\n| Landlord takes \u00bd share and pays \u00bd water-advantage-rate | 50 | 540 |\n| Tenant takes \u00bd share and pays no water-advantage-rate | 2,128 | 14,771 |\nFrom this it will be seen that rents are highest on Crown lands in the Colony, and lowest on the private canals of Shahpur Tahs\u00edl. As compared with the chah\u00e1rami lands on the private canals, the lands irrigated by Government inundation canals give the landlord a better return, since the maximum water-rate is Rs 2-8-0, whereas the value of a chah\u00e1ram is not less than Rs. 4-8-0 on an average and is often a great deal more; so that a land-owner on a Government inundation canal who has to pay the whole of the water-rate is no worse off than a chah\u00e1ram payer, who gets $\\frac{3}{8}$ of the total heap, while an owner who can get half the water-rate from his tenant is at least Rs. 3-4-0 per acre better off than a chah\u00e1ram payer who only gets $\\frac{1}{4}$ of the total heap.\n\nLarge deductions are made from the common heap of grain before division between the landlord and tenant. These deductions are generally very considerable, and are usually made in the form of so many top\u00e1s (a measure of capacity) per local maund or per plough paid to village artisans, menials and others who perform some service or have some claim, such as the blacksmith, carpenter and potter, the labourers who reap, thresh, winnow or carry the crop, the attendants on mosque and guest-house, the barber and even the beggar who goes about the village. Some detail of these fees will be found further on under the head of village menials. In the assessment calculations liberal allowances have been made for all these deductions everywhere, amounting in the area under fixed assessment to one-sixth of the total crop on lands irrigated from wells, and one-eighth on other classes of cultivation.\n\nIn the perennially irrigated area there are great diversities of custom. Mr. Rudkin estimated the total deductions (including reapers' and cotton-pickers' wages, the fodder allowed to the tenant, and the seed supplied by the owner) to amount to the following percentages of the gross produce:\n\n| Circle                  | Percentage |\n|-------------------------|------------|\n| Chen\u00e1b (Bhers)          | 12         |\n| Jhelum (Bhera)          | 13         |\n| Ara-Jhelum (Shahpur)    | 14         |\n| B\u00e1r (Bkern)             | 15         |\n| B\u00e1r Uttla (Sargodha)    | 17         |\n| B\u00e1r Hethla (Sargodha)   | 20         |\n\nA further deduction has to be made in the area under fixed assessment for fodder allowed to be fed off to the well bullocks on land irrigated from wells. It is usual for the landlord to allow\nthe tenant to grow on the well two or three acres of turnips' jov\u00e1r and other green crops, of which the landlord takes only a nominal share. Again in years of drought when fodder is very scarce, the tenant is allowed to cut the wheat green and to give it to his bullocks to keep them alive. In such a tract as the Ara Circle of Shahpur in a bad year as much as one-third of the wheat crop may be consumed in this way, the landlord practically getting no share of that portion of the crop; and in rabi 1892 after an almost total failure of the winter rains, it was found that nearly the whole crop on many wells in the Chen\u00e1b Circle had been consumed green in this way, so that there was almost no grain produce on those wells, and it was estimated that half the area of wheat in that circle had been used up as fodder before it ripened. On the other hand, in the case of some classes of land, an addition has to be made on account of the share of the straw taken by the landlord, which is sometimes of considerable value. For instance, on nahri and sail\u00e1b lands, the landlord generally takes half the straw as well as half the grain. In the case of wheat the weight of straw averages 12 maunds per acre and its average price three annas per maund (in bad years it sometimes fetches a rupee a maund); so that the landlord gets on nahri and sail\u00e1b land about one rupee's worth of straw on every acre under wheat.\n\nAccording to the calculations detailed in the assessment reports, the average value of kind rents on each main class of soil in the different assessment circles is as follows:\n\n| Tahsil | Circle | Ch\u00e1hi | Nahri or dbi. | Sail\u00e1b. | B\u00e1r\u00e1n\u00ed, I. | B\u00e1r\u00e1n\u00ed, II. | B\u00e1r\u00e1n\u00ed, III. |\n|--------|--------|-------|---------------|---------|------------|-------------|--------------|\n|        |        | Rs.

These averages are based on very cautious estimates of price and outturn, and allow liberal deduction for crop failure and expenses.\n\nA wages census was held in 1912, and it was found that the commonest rate for unskilled labour was 8 annas a day; but in busy seasons, e.g., when the wheat crop is being harvested, or canal clearances are in progress, it is easy for an ordinary man to make from 12 annas to a rupee. The rate for canal clearance is Rs. 3 per 1,000 cubic feet, and the amount that can be excavated in a day depends upon the length of leading and the height of lift, but 250 cubic feet may be taken as a fair day's work. The Path\u00e1ns who come down in the cold weather and engage in the building of mud walls and other earthwork make 12 or 14 annas a day. The wages of reapers (whose perquisites have already been described) approximate to a rupee a day: cotton-pickers are for the most part women and children, and they are generally content with 5 or 6 annas; the harvesting of mehdi round Bhera brings in about 12 annas a day in seasons when the labour market is otherwise rather slack.\n\nPloughmen are usually paid wholly in cash, at rates varying from Rs. 7 to 11 per month, or wholly in kind, taking a quarter of the crop.\n\nFor skilled labour, the usual rates are Re. 1 to Re. 1-4-0 a day for a carpenter or mason, and from 13 annas to a rupee for a blacksmith. But these workmen are also for the most part village servants receiving fixed allowances in kind for stated services rendered. It has been explained above that these allowances have been taken into account in calculating the value of rents. The rates vary from village to village, but the following table may be taken as showing the average in the old proprietary villages:\n\n| Labourer or kam\u00edn | Service         | Number of top\u00e1s* allowed |\n|-------------------|-----------------|--------------------------|\n|                   |                 | Per well on ch\u00e1di lands | Per plough on other soils |\n| Loh\u00e1r             | Iron-work       | 24                       | 4                         |\n| Tarh\u00e1n            | Wood-work       | 37                       | 5                         |\n| Kubb\u00e1r            | Pottery         | 30                       |                            |\n| Musalli           | General labour  | 75                       | 10                        |\n| Kubb\u00e1r            | Carrying the grain home | 57               | 12                        |\n\n*A top\u00e1s is a measure of capacity, practically equal to 2 seers in weight.\nThe salt miners of Warchha get about 8 annas a day, with extra emoluments for bagging and weighment. The coal miners of Taj\u00faw\u00e1la get Rs. 2 per day.\n\nFluctuations in wages-rates depend almost entirely on the local balance of supply and demand. If plague is abroad during the harvest season, the pay of reapers rises at once. If there has been a failure of rains in the Khush\u00e1b Tahsil or in Mi\u00e1nw\u00e1li, the rates in Sargodha will fall, and if the irrigated harvest is short, as is apt to happen in a dry year, the rates will fall still further. Thus it happens rather paradoxically that wages will generally be lowest when the local prices of food-grains are highest. The range of wages is generally somewhat lower in the Salt Range than in the plains, owing to the greater density of the population, and the fact that earthwork is generally done by the system of co-operative labour, known as vangar.\n\nIt will be seen from Table 25 that there has been a very sudden rise in rates both for skilled and unskilled labour within the last 20 years, and especially within the last decade. Even at last settlement, the ordinary rate for unskilled labour was between 3 and 4 annas a day: the normal rate for canal excavation was Re. 1-9-0 per 1,000 cubic feet: skilled labour earned from 6 to 11 annas a day. As recently as 30 years ago, it was possible to engage a day labourer for 2 annas. In general it may be said that wages doubled between first and second settlements, and again doubled between second and third settlements. And with the new demand for labour on the Lower Bari Doab and Upper Jhelum Canals, and the prospect of railway construction on a large scale from Chiniot to Khush\u00e1b, there is likely to be a still further rise.\n\nTable 26 shows the retail prices of the principal articles of food in quinquennial averages up to 1900 and for every year since. In 1893, Mr. Wilson wrote as follows:\n\nTaking the average of the 15 years, 1850 to 1864, which cover the period of settlement operations, as representing the prices of last settlement, and the average of the last ten years as representing the prices now prevalent, it may be said that that quantity of each article which would then have fetched Rs. 100 in silver, now fetches as follows: \u2014 Wheat Rs. 195, b\u00e1jra Rs. 188, jow\u00e1r Rs. 186, gram Rs. 189, barley Rs. 184, t\u00e1r\u00e1m\u00edra Rs. 133, gur Rs. 155, china Rs. 19\u00bd, cotton Rs. 125, and ghi Rs. 179; that is to say, the principal food-grains\u2014wheat, b\u00e1jra, jow\u00e1r, gram and barley, which together occupy three-fourths of the area under crop\u2014have each increased in money value more than 80\nper cent. since last settlement, and the price of wheat, which is by far the most important, has practically doubled. Making some allowance for the distance of the peasant from market, and the low prices of the villages as compared with the towns, I have assumed the following prices as the basis of assessment calculations throughout the district (in seers per rupee):\n\n|                  | Wheat | Bajra | Jowar | Gram. | Barley | Tadr\u00e9ma\u00efra. | Guf. | Cotton, un- | Chana. | Gh\u00e2i. |\n|------------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|--------|------------|------|-------------|--------|------|\n| Fifteen years, 1850\u201464 | 41    | 47    | 52    | 51    | 57     | 36         | 17   | 15          | 69     | 3\u00bd   |\n| Thirteen years, 1865\u201477 | 26    | 30    | 34    | 32    | 38     | 32         | 13   | 11          | 41     | 2    |\n| Average prices for the ten years, 1878\u201487 | 21    | 25    | 28    | 27    | 31     | 27         | 11   | 12          | 36     | 1\u00bd   |\n| Average prices assumed for assessment purposes | 25    | 30    | 35    | 35    | 40     | 35         | 15   | 15          | 45     | 2    |\n\nFor the six years since 1887 the average harvest prices for the district calculated in the same way have been as follows (in seers per rupee):\n\n|                  | Wheat | Bajra | Jowar | Gram. | Barley | Tadr\u00e9ma\u00efra. | Guf. | Cotton, un- | Chana. | Gh\u00e2i. |\n|------------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|--------|------------|------|-------------|--------|------|\n| Average price for the six years, 1888\u201493 | 19    | 20    | 24    | 24    | 28     | 17         | 11   | 9           | 28     | 1\u00bd   |\n\nThe prices of all produce have, therefore, been considerably higher during the last six years than during the previous ten, and although at this moment (1894) owing to good harvests here and low prices in England, grain is cheap, there is no reason to suppose that the prices assumed for assessment purposes are in any case too high. Indeed in some cases they are obviously too low.\n\nEvents have shown that this last remark was fully justified, but in subsequent reassessments the same caution has been observed. The following rates assumed for assessment purposes by Messrs. Rudkin and Leigh are clearly very much lower than\nwhat the experience of recent years would justify:\n\n| Prices in annas per maund | Wheat | Bajra | Jowar | Gram | Barley | Thirdeira or torda | Cotton, un-ginned |\n|---------------------------|-------|-------|-------|------|--------|-------------------|------------------|\n| Prices assumed by Mr. Rudkin ... | 36    | 25    | 26    | 28   | 22     | 52                | 80               |\n| Prices assumed by Mr. Leigh ... | 36    | 30    | 26    | (a) 24 | 24     | 42                | 88               |\n| Average note-book prices (1902\u201411) | 35    | 34    | 32    | 31   | 26     |                   | 97               |\n| Average note-book prices (1909\u201413) | 47    | 42    | 41    | 36   | 35     | 61                | 107              |\n\n(a) Assumed for the Thal Circle.\n\nThe history of prices since August 1914 is mainly a series of war speculations, prices rising and falling very abruptly in a manner entirely abnormal. So far as can be judged, the average of prices when peace is established is likely to be nearer to the average of 1909\u201413 than to that of 1902\u201411.\n\nIt has been calculated in the Assessment Report for Khush\u00e1b, and Bhera-Shahpur that the effective rise in prices since 1888 has been something like 35 per cent. and in 1888 the rise in comparison with the beginning of the regular settlement was shown to be 80 per cent., so the present range of prices must be at least 143 per cent. higher than those which prevailed 50 years ago, whereas since that time the incidence of the revenue has only been raised 40 per cent.\n\nThe main reason for the steady rise in prices is that there is an almost unlimited European demand for the most important staples produced in the district\u2014wheat, cotton, and oil-seeds in particular\u2014and the successful harvesting of an extra half million acres of crop, though an event of enormous importance to the district, has very little effect on the world-market. The direct communication with Kar\u00e1chi afforded by the Jech-Do\u00e1b and Sind-S\u00e1g\u00e1r Railways is of course a great advantage. Prices are very slightly affected by local abundance or scarcity; it will be seen from Section II that famine in the ordinary sense is unknown in this district; but when, as happened in 1908 and 1909, there is widespread scarcity in other parts of India, this district is at once able to reap the benefit of the high prices obtainable. When a fodder famine occurs, as happens not infrequently in Khush\u00e1b, large quantities of fodder are imported from irrigated tracts, including the Jhelum Colony, so that one part of the district benefits by the difficulties of another part.\nThe standard of living of the peasants has been generally described in Chapter I, Section C, and various innovations in the matter of dress, housing, furniture and food have been noted. But neither the enhancement of wealth nor the accession of luxuries has been evenly distributed over the entire population. Much of the gain from improved prices has gone into the pockets of the shopkeepers, who have made more progress than any other class in the matter of housing and jewelry. Men drawing a fixed salary from Government are of course relatively worse off now than they used to be, for they have to pay cash for everything they eat or use, and cash prices, whether for food, clothes, house-rent or domestic service, have risen greatly, and there has been no corresponding enhancement of salaries. In Sargodha especially, where the standard of living and the scale of prices are such as might be expected in a young town of new found wealth, there are constant complaints from officials of the lower grades as to the difficulty of making both ends meet. In the case of officials who might have charge of a circle in the district, a transfer to tahsil or district headquarters is regarded as a punishment, unless there is a hope of accelerated promotion.\n\nIt might be supposed that all who own or cultivate land must have benefitted greatly by the rise in value of their produce, but there are various reasons which tend to reduce the benefits actually received. Let us consider first the case of a tenant, with no land of his own. The supply of tenants is less than the demand for them, and so a tenant can generally take up as much land as he likes. But the amount of money he can save in the year depends upon the number of maunds of produce he can raise and the amount of dairy produce and stock which he can sell. He is in most cases incapable of intensive farming and only gets a moderate outturn per acre; and he cannot plough or irrigate more than a limited area in the year. In other words his methods of cultivation are incapable of giving a very large yield in the year. Out of this yield he has to feed and clothe himself and his family, maintain his bullocks, pay the landlord his rent (which in most cases includes a share of the Government demand), and, it must be remembered, bear his share of the burden thrown on the community by the inadequacy of salaries alluded to above. Many tenants are clearly of opinion that what pays them best is to put under crop only enough land to produce grain and cotton enough for their daily needs, and to rely for their surplus on their live stock, which can be grazed free of charge on the village waste and the fallows, and provide a form of produce in which the landlord claims no share and the Government no revenue. But the tenant is, if any\nthing, even less efficient as a stock-raiser than he is as a cultivator, and so he makes very much less income than he very well might. Now consider the case of the land-owner who does all his cultivation through tenants; it follows from what has been said that the crop brought on to the threshing-floor for division will be as small as the tenant cares to make it. And a landlord who tries to insist on greater attention to marketable crops and less to cattle and fodder, is apt to find himself left without tenants.\n\nOf the rent-receiving landlords, the private canal-owners are in far the strongest position; for they can attract tenants by the bait of a canal-supply for which no water-dues are payable, and no officials have to be propitiated. Hence they are in a position to insist that each tenant must grow a reasonable area of wheat and cotton. In these circumstances they are able to derive full benefit from the rise in prices, and there is no doubt that such of these men as take a reasonable amount of interest in their estates have enhanced their incomes enormously in the past forty years. There remain for consideration the landlords and colonists who cultivate all or some of their holdings themselves. The amount of money such men are able to save in the year depends partly on the extent to which their holding exceeds the area barely sufficient to maintain the family, and partly on the extent to which they are assisted in cultivation by relations and friends. If a man has only just enough land to support him and his family, he clearly has to make his surplus income by working as a tenant for someone else, and unless he can find a relation or friend to rent land to him, he will probably resort to the happy-go-lucky methods of tenancy described above. If he has more than he and his family can cultivate, he will clearly make a substantial surplus on the area self-cultivated (for he is practically supporting himself as tenant and paying rent to himself as landlord), and from the balance he will make much or little according as he finds tenants whose interests coincide with his own or not. Next to the private canal-owner, the man in the strongest position is the holder of a colony grant who can summon assistance from a congested home-village. One can generally recognize in the Salt Range the house of an Aw\u00e1n with squares in the colony. And similarly, if one rides from the Jhelum valley into the colony, one can see a marked difference in the relative appearances of domestic affluence. There are, of course, matters which affect all cultivators equally, tending to retard the rate of enrichment in relation to the rate of value-enhancements. These are (1) the increased expenditure on wages and material; (2) the periodical revisions of the schedule of water-rates, the land revenue settlement, the local cesses and\nso forth; (3) the occasional necessity for having to buy back dear what he sold cheap at harvest time; (4) the utter incapacity for business and organization which puts him at the mercy of the local shop-keepers, and prevents co-operation in the introduction of expensive improvements or collective bargaining.\n\nThere are two grounds for hope that in the near future the cultivator's material condition will improve even more rapidly than in the past: the people are no longer helpless in the face of plague; they have learnt to evacuate their houses at the first sign of a dead rat, and they tolerate fumigation and other preventive measures; hence it may be hoped that the ravages of the past decade will soon be made good; and the co-operative movement has taken firm root; the proportion of wealth remaining in the hands of the peasants will increase as the movement develops.\n\nThe classes that have no land and make their living by unskilled labour have gained considerably by the general rise in values. They are paid either in cash or in kind. If they are paid in cash, the rates of pay have risen more quickly than the price of necessities; and if they are paid in kind, they get much of their pay in the form of high priced staples, while they are content to live on the low-priced millets, and pulses. In years when plague has depleted the labour-market, the reapers can make large sums, and there have been three such years in the last decade. Canal excavation is another form of employment which pays very well. But probably the improvement in their condition merely amounts to a greater ability to buy enough nourishing food and a more adequate wardrobe. Perhaps the year's savings will be invested in milch-cattle, if the labourer comes from a village where grazing is cheap. At most the unskilled labourer has hitherto only succeeded in attaining to decent comfort, and he has little margin for luxuries.\n\nSection C.\u2014Forests.\n\nIn Table 27 will be found the details of reserved and unclassed forests by tahsils. Recent measurements in Khush\u00e1b shew that the area of reserved forests in that tahsil is 267,617 acres. These are of two distinct kinds, (a) the Salt Range Rakhs, which consists of hill-sides more or less covered with phuldh, k\u00e1\u00fa, sanattha, and the other shrubs described in Chapter I; (b) the rakhs in the Chhachh and Thal, which are merely grass-lands with a sparse growth of jand, ber, kikar, kari and lana or phog. The former are controlled by the Extra Assistant Conservator, Jhelum Division, with head-quarters at Jhelum; and the latter, together with the small area of reserved forest in the cis-Jhelum tahsils, by the Extra Assistant Conservator, Chen\u00e1b Division, with head-quarters at Wazirabad.\nA forest settlement was carried out by Mr. Wilson in 1897, and all questions of right were decided. In the Salt Range all rakh except Sakesar and Keri are burdened with rights of grazing; in the plains, no right to graze is admitted, but in each rakh certain villages are allowed to graze. Both in the hills and in the plains the general practice is to lease the grazing for the year to the village or villages entitled or allowed to graze in each rakh, for a fixed sum, which the villagers recover partly by levying fixed charges on the animals of other villages and partly by distributing the balance of the demand rateably over their own animals. The usual method of rating is to assess camels, buffaloes, cows, and sheep or goats in the ratios of 16, 8, 4 and 1 respectively. In a few cases selected individuals are given the lease, and allowed to recover fixed rates from all cattle; and where no such individual has been selected and the villagers are unable to work the lease amicably, the grazing fees are realized by Government direct. In these cases the rates realized are:\n\n| Kind of animal | Tahsil Bhera | Tahsil Shahpur and Thal rakh* | Salt Range rakh |\n|----------------|--------------|-------------------------------|----------------|\n|                | Rs.

Throughout this expanse, villages inhabited by various Muhammadan tribes, whose chief wealth consisted in cattle, were to be found very often at distances of 10 to 12 miles apart. Owing partly to the scarcity of well water, and to the dearth of rain which is a characteristic of the Shahpur climate, and to the presence of trees and shrubs on which camels feed, and to there being during some months of the year (if the fall of rain has been at all favourable) an abundance of grass, the people carried on very little agriculture, but kept up large flocks and herds.\n\nAs the villages were few and far apart, disputes about grazing ground were of rare occurrence. There was land enough for all. But sometimes a dispute took place about the right of watering cattle at a certain pond or natural tank. Two villages, situated a dozen miles apart, would perhaps in a season of drought, both assert a claim to water their cattle at a tank.\nequidistant between their villages. In the endeavour to enforce their fancied rights, a fight would ensue, and the victors would probably build a few grass huts for themselves and their cattle, in which they would reside for a couple of months and then desert the place for some better locality. The defeated party of one year often turned the tables on their adversaries in the year after, and took possession of the disputed water. Might was right, and beyond actual possession, there was no test by which to judge as to what lands ought to be considered as within the boundaries of any particular village.\n\nWhen regular settlement operations commenced, the country having been annexed some five years, and the people having had such preparatory instruction as two summary settlements could afford, the zamindars, knowing our respect for prescriptive rights, determined to divide the jungle among themselves. They accordingly established little outposts, with a few men and a few head of cattle in each of them, at distances of several miles round the parent village, and proposed to encircle them all in one ring-fence which was to represent their village boundary. Had this arrangement been permitted, the result would have been that the whole jungle, which may hereafter become valuable property to the State, would have been appropriated by a few thousand cattle graziers, whose annual contribution of revenue does not in the aggregate exceed 35,000 rupees. To show how preposterous were some of the claims raised, Mr. Ouseley mentions that the present area of mauza Lak, after converting large tracts originally included by the villagers in their boundary into Government rakhs, still exceeds 40,000 acres.\n\nBefore the commencement of our rule, owing to the lawlessness of the times, however far parties took their cattle from the villages during the day, they brought them back to the protection of the village for the night. After annexation people became bolder. Small parties of men who would formerly have been afraid to have separated themselves so far from the main village, during the next few years sunk a kacha well and built a hut or two, at some spot favourable for pasturage, five or ten miles from their village. More than this, as the people began to learn the weight which is attached by us to possession, they took to ploughing up and sowing small patches of ground not equal in size to a quarter of an acre, at distances of from three to ten miles from their villages, the object being to try and make good their title to all the intermediate grazing land between these patches and their village sites. Thus Mr. Ouseley writes (1859): \"Last year, when at Mitha Tiwana, I had to visit a spot which was the subject of dispute between the zamindars of Mitha and Ukhli Mohila, I found that the disputed boundary was nearly ten miles from one village and seven miles from the other. The dispute itself extended over five or six miles of desert and before I left the spot the zamindars of Roda in the Leiah district came up and declared that the land which I had been looking at belonged to their village, which was six or seven miles away. During my ride I was taken by one party or other to see the marks of their possessions, which were little patches of ground of the size of a quarter of an acre or so, scattered over distances of a mile or more from each other, in which somebody had sown a few seeds of bajra which had never ripened owing to want of rain. The existence of these spots appeared to be only known to a few men on either side; and on the recriminations which used to follow on\ntheir being brought to notice, I believe they were ploughed up and the seed cast in secretly at night, and then neglected altogether, as the object was not to attract the attention of the opposite party to the progress that was being made in securing ground until the settlement ahilk\u0101rs should commence operations.\"\n\nAfter much deliberation it was arranged that the demarcation of boundaries in the B\u0101r should be carried out on the same principle as had been adopted in Gujranw\u0101la. The villages were called on to state how many head of cattle they possessed, and they were allowed an area of waste land calculated upon the number of their cattle, at 4 acres a head in the B\u0101r and 10 acres in the Thal, five sheep or goats being counted as equal to an ox. In the Mitha Tiw\u0101na Thal Mr. Ouseley marked out boundaries arbitrarily, without reference to the numbers of cattle, or rather, to any exact scale based upon that number. The quantity of land that each village was entitled to being once settled, every effort was made to draw out boundaries with a due regard to existing possession, and where possession did not exist to prevent it, the village area was made of as compact a shape as was feasible. But so averse were the villagers to this arrangement, that they threw every obstacle in the way of the persons employed for the demarcation of their boundaries. The area remaining after this demarcation was constituted Government rakhs.\n\nIt might have been supposed that the plan adopted would have led the people to exaggerate their possessions, in order to obtain large pasture grounds, but such was not the case. The people of this country are everywhere suspicious, and here they seem to have thought that a trap was being laid to extract from them the real numbers of their cattle, in order that the information might be afterwards made use of to raise the assessment; they therefore, if anything, returned the number of cattle as too small. But the arithmetical standard was liberal in itself and was not too strictly applied, every care being taken that the area allotted to each village should be more than amply sufficient for its greatest possible requirements.\n\nBetween the first and Second Regular settlements, some 51,106 acres of this State land were granted on long lease for cultivation to various lessees; the bulk of this area was granted to those who undertook to irrigate the land from inundation canals of their own construction, or to individuals whose services at the time of the Mutiny required special recognition. Soon after Second settlement, it was decided that all the more important grantees should be given the option of purchasing their grants at a cheap valuation or of renewing their leases for the term of settlement, with the option of further renewals, but no right of purchase. Nearly all seized the opportunity to purchase their grants, and only 5,618 acres are now held on long lease. Other lesser grantees were given occupancy rights, as described in Chapter III, Section C. Others again, who had grants in the B\u0101r, became colonists, and their grants are merged in the 436,273 acres of Government land allotted in the Lower Jhelum Colony.\nSteps are being taken to disforest a considerable area of Rakhs Khabakki and Shin Dhakki, on the borders of Talagang, with a view to their being made over to the neighbouring villages for cultivation.\n\nOf the unclassed forests, the only ones, which have any importance as fuel and fodder reserves are the strips of land along the Gujr\u00e1t-Jhang road on either side of Shahpur, known as Chak Patri\u2014north and south. These are fine plantations of grass and trees, interspersed with wells held by occupancy tenants, which are managed by the District Board.\n\nFrom the point of view of silviculture these forests are of no great economic value. Very few of them contain much timber, and there are no regular fellings and replacements. But as fuel and fodder reserves for the countryside they are invaluable, and in years of drought their existence is greatly appreciated by the villagers, as they contain much more vegetation than does the waste of the surrounding villages. They are also of value in the plains in that they add greatly to the financial success of large schemes of irrigation. There is of course a certain amount of friction between villagers and forest-guards, who are of necessity somewhat loosely supervised, and instances of incendiarism sometimes occur, but these are promptly punished by the closing of the forest to all grazing for a period of five years.\n\nSection D.\u2014Mines and Mineral Resources.\n\nSalt is found all along the southern ridge of the Salt Range and especially near its base, generally associated with the red marl which is so conspicuous a feature of this part of the range. During the Sikh times the revenue from the excavation and sale of salt was realised by means of farms, the price at the mines being then one rupee per maund. It is now managed directly by the State, the price of salt at the mines being the actual cost of excavation plus the duty, which is at present (1915) Re. 1-0-0 per maund. There are outcrops of salt at many places, requiring to be constantly watched for fear of smuggling, but the only place in this district where excavation is now carried on is at the Rukhla Gorge about two miles to the west of Warchha. A portion of this mine was worked by the Sikhs, but their workings have now been abandoned as dangerous owing to no pillars having been left to prevent the roof falling in. The present workings are carried on on a scientific principle in a seam of salt, the thickness of which is 20 feet, increasing as it dips into the hill, the chambers and tunnels being so arranged as to leave a sufficient number of strong pillars to support the roof, and so as to admit the necessary amount of air to the workings. A new tunnel at a low level, commenced about three years ago, has proved some excellent\nseams of salt, considerably thicker than those hitherto worked. Chambers are now being excavated in the thickest of these seams. The salt is remarkably pure, only about 3 per cent. being foreign matter. The excavations are carried on by a special class of miners, called wadh\u00e1s (cutters), 47 of whom are regularly employed, the rate paid them being Rs 5-8-0 per 100 maunds. They are a sickly race, owing no doubt to the bad air they breathe in the mines. Their net earnings amount to about 8 annas a day, but they work in the mines only for about 247 days in the year. These earnings the miners supplement by performing other duties, connected with the bagging and weighment of salt, for which they are paid at the rate of Re. 0-14-6 per 100 maunds. Their women carry the salt out of the mines on their heads, a common load being from 60 to 80 lbs. in weight. The price charged for the salt is 1\u00bd annas per maund in addition to the duty. The quantity of salt sold and delivered, which for the five years ending 1882-83 averaged 123,767 maunds, was as follows during the past 5 years:\n\n| Year   | Maunds |\n|--------|--------|\n| 1910-11| 152,722|\n| 1911-12| 159,797|\n| 1912-13| 156,231|\n| 1913-14| 131,720|\n| 1914-15| 141,554|\n\nAverage ... 148,405\n\nso that the amount of trade done is greater than it was 30 years ago, although the Warchha mine is still 9 miles from the nearest railway station,* while the railway has been brought close up to its chief competitor, the Mayo Mine at Khewra in the Jhelum District, at which the cost of excavation is Rs. 6-3-0 per 100 maunds, but the same price of 1\u00bd annas per maund is charged for the salt. The Warchha salt is by some consumers considered to be of slightly superior quality to that of Khewra. The amount in stock at the end of the year was 12,440 maunds. The Warchha salt is carried away almost entirely on camels, and about three-quarters of the whole outturn is taken to Khush\u00e1b whence it is mainly sent by boat to Mult\u00e1n and other places down the river. Mult\u00e1n last year took 114,20 maunds; the other chief markets for this salt are Bhakkar, Khush\u00e1b and Jhang. The total realisation averaged for the three years ending 1914-15 Rs. 1,54,528, and the total expenditure of the Warchha beat, which includes 33 miles of the range, averaged Rs. 20,042, being\n\n*Since the above was written the laying down of a single 5 feet gauge line between Gunjyal Station and Warchha Mandi has been taken in hand, and is expected to be completed before the 1st April 1917. The opening of this line will give a great stimulus to the Warchha trade.\n12\u00b797 per cent. on the gross receipts. On this beat there are employed a Superintendent and Inspector and 56 men, who have to guard 18 posts along the range, besides the mine itself. The Katha beat also lies partly in this district. Its total length is 40 miles, guarded by 10 posts, and its staff consists of one Inspector and 26 men, costing on the average Rs. 4,012 annually. No salt is excavated in this beat, and there is therefore no income. Notwithstanding the many opportunities for smuggling, this offence is very rare and no cases were prosecuted in both beats during the three years ending 1914-15.\n\nAs in the mines at Khewra and N\u00farpur, salts of potash occur in the salt at Warchha, distributed in irregular and discontinuous bands among the salt, from which it is hardly distinguishable in appearance. Up to now potash has been found in three chambers of the mine, and apparently these three occurrences are all parts of one potash band: if so, this band has a proved lateral extent of over two hundred feet. Exploration work has now been undertaken to ascertain more exactly the depth and lateral extent of the deposit. When first potash was encountered, it was considered to be inedible salt, and mining at that point was discontinued: its real nature was first discovered by an ordinary miner\u2014Karam Il\u00e1hi\u2014who had been transferred to N\u00farpur and set to work on potash deposits there. He drew attention to the similarity of the N\u00farpur deposits and the abandoned seams at Warchha.\n\nThere are at present two coal mines being worked in the district, on the southern slope of the Salt Range east of Katha Saghral, viz., Taju W\u00e1la and Jhakkar Kot; they are connected with the Sind-S\u00e1g\u00e1r Railway at Dhak Station by means of a light line 12 miles long. The seam of coal worked at these two places is of variable thickness, but averages perhaps 3 feet: it is worked by means of drifts from the outcrop, a wasteful method by which only the coal lying near the edges of the field is won. The total quantity of coal in both areas has been estimated at about 1,250,000 tons. In quality it is similar to that of Dandot, i.e., of the tertiary age; it has been analysed as follows:\n\n|                | Taju W\u00e1la | Jhakkarhot |\n|----------------|-----------|------------|\n| Moisture       | 5\u00b708      | 7\u00b760       |\n| Volatile matter| 31\u00b701     | 35\u00b766      |\n| Fixed carbon   | 37\u00b731     | 48\u00b750      |\n| Ash            | 26\u00b760     | 10\u00b724      |\nExcepting a small amount of excavation in 1890, the T\u00e1ju W\u00e1la mine was first exploited on 1st April 1906; the Jhakkar Kot mine was worked from April 1905 till December 1909, and again from September 1912 it has been worked continuously. These two are collectively called the Katha Coal Mines and are leased to Messrs. Bhagw\u00e1u D\u00e1s, R\u00e1m D\u00e1s, Contractors of R\u00e1walpindi, for 15 years, ending 15th January 1918. The terms of the lease are that the lessees are entitled to extract 1,040 tons every half year, on payment of a fixed rent of Rs. 130. For every ton of coal in addition exported or manufactured into coke a royalty of one anna is payable; ground rent is also charged at 1 anna per acre. Since 1910 the collections have been as follows:\n\n| Year | Outturn in tons | Fixed rent and royalty | Ground rent | Remarks |\n|------|-----------------|------------------------|-------------|---------|\n| 1910 | ...             | 715                    | 62          | ...     |\n| 1911 | ...             | 1,804                  | 44          | 584*    |\n| 1912 | ...             | 3,227                  | 243*        | 94      |\n| 1913 | ...             | 5,338                  | 311         | 93      |\n| 1914 | ...             | 5,206                  | 503         | 93      |\n\nIn addition to these, two others, known as Chota T\u00e1ju W\u00e1la and Shamil\u00e1t Nal\u00ed, were worked from 1906 to 1909, and two, known as Pfr Chan Pfr Mine (Pail) and Nal\u00ed North, were opened up in 1908 but coal was never successfully extracted.\n\nSmall quantities of lignite have been found in the hills south of Sakesar, but not in workable quantity.\n\nGypsum and mica are common in places, and traces of iron and lead have been found in the Range.\n\nTar-shows have been noticed in Rakhs Khabakki, Mardw\u00e1l and Dhaddar. A license to prospect in this locality has been applied for by the Indolea Syndicate of 64, Cornhill, London, but has not as yet been actually granted. The Burnah Oil Company have also applied for a license to prospect in the same neighbourhood. In various other places in the Salt Range are springs the surfaces of which are discoloured by films of petroleum; such are those in the Sodhi Gorge, the Kuchhra and the Gosar torrents of Kufri, the Kalra spring just above Potha (near...\nKathwai), the Garh\u00e1liw\u00e1la Gorge south of Kuraddhi and Tilio-\ntarw\u00e1la in Uchhali.\n\nThe nummulitic limestone of which so large a portion of\nthe hills is composed is used for building purposes, and great\nquantities of it have been removed from the mouth of the\nRukhla Gorge near Warehouse by the Railway Engineers and\nused as ballast for the line. In a year about 10,000 maunds of\nlimestone are brought from the base of the hills to Khush\u00e1b\nand Dhak (a distance of .2 miles) on camel and pack bullocks\nand there sold at the rate of from Rs. 7 per hundred maunds\nto be used in the manufacture of lime or soap, or to be exported\nby boat and train to Jhang and Amritsar.\n\nIn 1915 lime sold at Khush\u00e1b at 7 or 9 annas per maund\naccording to quality. Since the opening of the railway a large\nbusiness in lime-burning has been started close to the railway\nstations from Harriya to Bhera, lime stone being brought from\nthe hills near Khewra by rail at a cost of Rs. 2-1-4 per hundred\nmaunds, and wood got from the jungles of the Bhera B\u00e1r at a\ncost of Rs. 27-8-0 per hundred maunds. A hundred maunds of\nlimestone give 60 maunds of lime. Altogether 10 kilns were\nat work in 1915 and the total outturn of lime was estimated at\nmore than 35,000 maunds per annum. It sells on the spot at\n7 annas per maund, but is mostly exported by rail to Lahore,\nAmritsar, Mult\u00e1n and other distant towns.\n\nA peculiar sort of limestone (khanggar) is found near Sodhi\nand at some other places in the range. It lies in strata just\nbelow the surface of the soil and when first excavated it is soft\nand easily fashioned into square blocks, but after a few days'\nexposure to the air it becomes hard. It seems to be of the same\nnature as kankar (rore) which is found in small calcareous\nnodules just below the surface of the ground at some places in\nthe B\u00e1r, but rarely in such quantities as to make it useful for\nroad-making or lime-burning.\n\nKallar shor is the term applied to the efflorescence which ap-\npears on the surface under the influence of evaporation and capil-\nlary attraction wherever there is much salt of any kind in the soil.\nEvidences of its presence are found all over the district, sometimes\nin the form of barren strips and patches in the middle of an other-\nwise fertile field. Where there is much salt in the soil, it is\nabsolutely barren. Kallar is most prevalent in the tract along the\nfoot of the Salt Range, beyond reach of the hill torrents, and in the\nAra tract in the south of the Shahpur Tahsil. There is a curious\nkallar plain immediately to the north of Sahiw\u00e1l. In Shahpur Tahsil there is long strip of kallar-infected land stretching from Dhakw\u00e1n to Bhakkar, and on along the line of the Didhar, which the inhabitants ascribe to the excessive saturation of the soil by the great flood of 1893. In this tract wells are useless, unless worked in conjunction with canal irrigation.\n\nSaltpetre is manufactured in considerable quantities from the numerous mounds in the cis-Jhelum tract which mark the sites of former villages. A long narrow drain is dug on high ground and covered over with a filter made of twigs and grass, on which is sprinkled powdered nitrous earth from the old mounds. Water is then poured over the earth and filters through into the drain carrying with it in solution the salts contained in the earth. The dark brown liquid runs from the drain into a vessel placed to catch it, and from that is poured into a large iron pan, in which it is kept boiling until the solution approaches saturation when it is allowed to cool and crystallize. Its dirty brown crystals are crude saltpetre (bugd\u00e1n) which is usually sold to the refiners. This rude manufacture is carried on during the dry months chiefly by Hindus of the shopkeeper class who are required to take out a license and pay Rs. 2\u00bd for each pan used. It requires to be closely supervised to prevent the manufacturers from refining their saltpetre or producing edible salt. The manufacturer generally pays two annas a day to the owners of the nearest well who supply him with the water he requires; and he usually pays the landowners a lump sum, varying with the quality of the soil and the convenience of the site, for the privilege of being allowed to take the earth from the mound and fuel from the neighbouring jungle. In 1914, 21 mounds in Bhera and Shahpur Tahsils were leased by the owners in this way for Rs. 10,355. Two mounds in Haripur are leased for Rs. 4,000, and one in Vegow\u00e1l for Rs. 1,600; two in the Chak Patri for Rs. 1,920, and one in Jah\u00e1nabad for Rs. 1,000.\n\nThe Crimean War and the Mutiny gave a great impulse to the manufacture of saltpetre, for the number of licenses to work pans rose from 694 in 1855 to 4,856 in 1858, and the selling price of crude saltpetre was then Rs. 4 per maund. In 1864 the number of licenses fell to 185, and the price to little more than Re. 1 per maund. The number of licenses granted in 1892-93 was 153, the number of pans at work 156, and the price of crude saltpetre from Re. 1-6-0 to Re. 1-12-0 per maund. The manufacture was carried on from about 80 mounds, chiefly situated in the Bar and Ara tracts. In 1914 only 24 licenses were\ngranted, and only 24 pans were at work. The price of crude saltpetre has again risen to Rs. 4 per maund. The licenses are granted by the Deputy Commissioner.\n\nCrude saltpetre, manufactured as above described, consists of a mixture of nitre, common salt and earth matter. It is refined at refineries specially licensed on payment of a fee for the year of Rs. 50. It is first dissolved in boiling water in an iron boiler till common salt is precipitated from the solution. The salt is removed and destroyed, and the boiling liquor drawn off into earthen vessels in which it is allowed to rest until earth and other impurities have settled. The clear liquor is then decanted and set out in a pan to crystallize. Next day the long pen-like crystals (hence called kalmi) which have formed in the pans are removed and stored for sale. In 1892 there were five licensed refineries in the neighbourhood of Bhera and Mi\u00e1ni with 41 boilers. Refined saltpetre sold at Rs. 5 or Rs. 6-8-0 per maund and 26 licenses were given in that year for the export of 10,832 maunds of refined saltpetre. About 6,000 maunds went to Sukkur and Kar\u00e1chi for export to Europe and the rest went chiefly to Bannu and R\u00e1walpindi for the manufacture of gunpowder to be used in Public Works. In 1914, there were only 2 licensed refineries, with 15 boilers apiece. Refined saltpetre was in 1914 worth Rs. 10 to Rs. 13 per maund: 12 licenses were given for the export of 3,977 maunds, all of which (except for 200 maunds sent to R\u00e1walpindi and 70 maunds sent to Dera Ismail Khan) went to the Canal head-works at Mangla.\n\nBarilla (khar or sajj\u00ed), an impure carbonate of soda, is manufactured from the khar or sajj\u00ed plant (salsola Griffithsii) which used to grow in great quantities on the hard clay soil of the B\u00e1r and Ara tract of Shahpur Tahs\u00edl south of the Lahore road. There are two varieties of the plant, one with white and one with red flowers. It flowers in October and is cut in November when ripe, and left on the ground to dry. It is then thrown in bundles into a circular pit five or six feet in diameter and about two feet deep in which a fire has been lit and there burnt, care being taken not to let the fire get too low or be smothered by too much fuel, until the pit is nearly filled with the ashes of the plant, which melt into a viscous mass. The operation lasts about twenty-four hours, and the quantity burned during this time is from one to two hundred bundles, each of about half a maund in weight. The contents of the pit are then well stirred and allowed to cool, a little dry earth being scattered over the surface to prevent evaporation. The\npits are opened on the fifth or sixth day, when the barilla is found concreted together into a hard cellular mass something like the refuse of a brick-kiln. It is exported from this district chiefly to the north and east, towards R\u00e1walpindi, Si\u00e1lkot and Jhelum, and is extensively used in the manufacture of soap, paper and coarse glass, in bleaching and dyeing processes, as a medicine and as a substitute for soap. The price of khar or sajji appears to have steadily risen. In Sikh times its price was 6 or 8 annas per maund, in 1866 it was Re. 1-2-0 per maund and in 1896 from Re. 1-8-0 to Rs. 2 per maund according to quality. The cost of manufacture is estimated at 6 annas per maund. The sajji plant is a favourite food of camels, and has to be carefully protected from them if it is intended to manufacture barilla. The plant was chiefly found in the large blocks of land owned by the State, and the right of manufacturing the alkali or of grazing camels on the plant as they found most profitable was annually sold to speculators. The income to the State from this source was Rs. 8,000 in 1865 and averaged Rs. 7,700 for the five years ending 1894-95. Previous to the severe drought of 1891 the income generally stood at about Rs. 10,000. It varied considerably from year to year, as the growth of the plant depends upon the variable rains, and as heavy showers in the season of manufacture (November and December) may greatly reduce the outturn. In an average year the quantity manufactured probably amounted to about 5,000 maunds. Since the advent of the Lower Jhelum Canal, the home of the salsola has been brought under the plough, and barilla is no longer manufactured in large quantities in the cis-Jhelum Tahsils. An inferior kind of barilla khar is made by a similar process from another salsola (the phissak l\u00e1n\u00ed) plant near the foot of the Salt Range in the Khush\u00e1b Tahsil. This sells at about 1 or 2 rupees per maund and is used chiefly for washing clothes. About 6,000 maunds of this inferior barilla are annually produced in the Khush\u00e1b Tahsil, whence it is mostly exported to Lahore, Amritsar, Si\u00e1lkot and Mult\u00e1n.\n\nSection E.\u2014Arts and Manufactures.\n\nIn almost every village the cotton of the district is woven into coarse cloth (khaddar) from which the clothing of the peasantry is made and which is exported in large quantities, Girot and Khush\u00e1b being the centres of this trade. The weavers are usually Paoli by caste, and the importance of the cotton industry to the district can be seen from the fact that 37,132 persons were recorded in 1911 as subsisting on industries connected with the preparation and weaving of cotton; of this number,\n16,831 were actual workers and 20,301 dependents, and of the workers, 6,490 were women, who do most of the spinning. The distribution over the different branches of industry is shown here. The extent to which handwork has been supplanted by factories will be discussed below:\n\n| Workers | Dependents |\n|---------|------------|\n| Male    | Female     |\n| Cotton ginning, cleaning, and pressing | 1,548 | 154 | 3,138 |\n| Cotton spinning, sizing, and weaving | 8,793 | 6,336 | 17,163 |\n\nFine cotton striped goods bordered with silk (lungis) of good quality are made at Khush\u00e1b, where also are made good coloured khes, loom-woven checks, and diapered cloths (bultul chashm).\n\nPagris, and the other scarf-like forms of silk popular, are woven, sometimes plain and sometimes with gold ends, at Khush\u00e1b, which has a name for silk-weaving and has sent good specimens to various exhibitions. At one time about 50 looms in that town were producing dary\u00e1s and lung\u00eds, but now the weavers are finding it more profitable to produce the coarse cotton fabrics, and only 6 persons were returned as actually working as silk-weavers in 1911.\n\nIt may be mentioned that the flower-worked chaddar or ohri of red or blue country woven cotton cloth ornamented with silk embroidery is worn in the district, but few are made for sale.\n\nFelt or namda rugs are made at Bhera and Khush\u00e1b, in both white and grey, unbleached or coloured wool, decorated with large barbaric patterns of red wool merely felted and beaten into the surface. The white felts bear no comparison with those of Kashmir and parts of R\u00e1jp\u00fat\u00e1na, and the texture is so loose and imperfect that they seem to be always shedding the goat's hair with which they are intermixed. The wool is not perfectly cleaned, and they are peculiarly liable to the attacks of insects. But they are among the cheapest floor coverings produced in the Province, costing Re. 1 per seer.\n\nGoat's hair and camel's hair are worked up into rope, as in most pastoral districts. At N\u00farpur, lo\u00eds or country blankets are made; they have no special character of colour or texture, but are very durable and warm.\nThe wares in wood and metal from this district which have been sent to several exhibitions, give an impression of great technical aptitude, which seems to find but little employment and scanty remuneration. It is a commonplace to say that there is in this country but little of the sub-division of labour, and none of the machinery, which make European products cheap; but even in India there are few examples of the union in one craftsman of so many trades as are practised by the Bhera cutlers. Long before the introduction of machinery the Sheffield cutlery trade was divided into many branches, and the man who forged a blade neither ground it, nor hafted it, nor fitted it with a sheath. At Gujrat and Si\u00e1lkot the smith forges caskets and other articles of the koftgar's trade in complete independence of the workman who damascenes them with silver and gold. But at Bhera, the same artizan fashions the blade on the anvil, grinds and polishes it, cuts the hilts or handles from stone of mother-o'-pearl, and makes a leather covered sheath for dagger or sword. The favourite hilt is in the green, slightly translucent stone (sang-i-yashm) largely used in the baz\u00e1r for amulets and neck beads, which has been identified as a very pure serpentine called Bowenite. It is found in masses in a gorge near Gandamak in Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n where it costs Rs. 3 per maund, but by the time it reaches Bhera it is worth Rs. 40 per maund. Some of it is a delicate apple-green, and other pieces are like verde antique marble. It is very useful in mosaic work. Besides knife handles and dagger hilts, it is fashioned at Bhera into caskets, paper-weights, cups, &c. The work is always liberally smeared with oil to remove the white marks left by cutting tools.\n\nA favourite form for a dagger hilt ends in an animal's head. In the collections of arms in the possession of some of the R\u00e1jp\u00fatana and Central India Chiefs, this design is seen beautifully wrought in crystal, and jewelled jade. The Bhera rendering is a very elementary attempt at a head.\n\nOther stones used resemble Parbeck marble, and are found in the neighbouring Salt range. The names given are vague, and seem to be applied on very slight grounds. Suleim\u00e1n\u00ed patthar, sang-i-jarah, pila patthar, sang-i-marmar are some of them, and they explain themselves. These are used for dinner knives and arms as well as for the ornamental articles made in stone.\n\nA pretty herring-bone pattern of alternate zig-zags in black and mother-o'-pearl is frequently used for hilts. The mother-o'-pearl is imported from Bombay. The lapidary's tools in use differ in no respect from those in use at Agra, and indeed all the\nworld over where machinery and diamond-pointed drills are not used. A heavily loaded bow with wire string (or two for thin slices) is used for sawing, corundum and water furnishing the iron wire with a cutting material, while the grinding and polishing wheels are the usual discs of corundum and lac, turned with the drill-bow for small work, or with the strap for heavy; but always with the to-and-fro non-continuous revolution of Indian wheels.\n\nThe best country iron, known at Bhera as d\u00e2na, is, in fact, a sort of steel; and when this is used, some of the blades of Bhera cutlery are of tolerably good quality, but it gets rarer yearly. Old files of English make are sought out and reforged into various forms. Old blades of stub and twist steel are often refurbished, and the ab or jauhar (the wavy markings in the texture of the blade) are still prized. These markings are rudely imitated for the benefit of English purchasers. The blade is covered with a mixture of lime and milk, forming a sort of etching ground on which, as it is drying off, the artificer's thumb is dabbed, with the effect of printing the concentric markings of the skin. Kase (sulphate of iron) is then applied as a mordant and, when skilfully done, the effect is not unlike that of a real Damascus blade. No expert, however, could be for a moment deceived by this etching.\n\nAt Bhera chaukats or door and window frames are most elaborately carved in deodar and shisham wood. The rates at which these beautiful works are supplied to native purchasers are almost incredibly low, but as a European demand has arisen they have been raised. The work differs from that of Chiniot in that the projectieres are flatter, pilasters and other details being often merely indicated in relief instead of a half or quarter section being imposed. And the whole of the surface is completely covered with boldly outlined forms of foliage and geometric diaper made out for the most part with a V-section cut. There is something rude and almost barbaric in this direct and simple method of execution; but although there is no attempt at high finish, the general design and proportions are so good, and the decorative scheme is so full and complete, that the technical imperfection of the work as carving is scarcely noticed. A large door-way, completely covered with ornamental work, measuring ten feet high and proportionate width, costs to a native purchaser about Rs. 150. Formerly such doors could be obtained for Rs. 25, but no use was ever made by the Public Works Department of this beautiful and wonderfully cheap carpentry. The production of these doors and windows is not confined to\nBhera; they are also made at Mi\u00e1ni* and perhaps at other places in the district. Wood-carvers from Bhera have been sent to more than one exhibition in England where they and their workmanship have earned admiration.\n\nThe lacquered wood turnery of S\u00e1hiw\u00e1l differs from that of other places in being more crude in colour and simpler in execution. A particularly unpleasant aniline mauve is used; but there is a better class of vases, platters and toys made in two colours, red and black, or red and yellow, or black with either. The scratched patterns are bolder and larger than elsewhere and many toys, e.g., children\u2019s tea-sets, are finished in transparent lac only, the colour and grain of the wood showing through. Chess-boards with chess men and a large variety of toys of forms that might puzzle an English child, are made at very cheap rates, but they do not seem to be as popularly known as they deserve to be. From the same town ivory toys of some neatness and skill in execution were sent to the Punjab Exhibition.\n\nCombs are made at N\u00farpur from olive-wood got from near K\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1gh on the Indus.\n\nThere is nothing very noteworthy or distinctive in the jewelry or silversmith\u2019s work of the countryside. From the chief places of the district, as well as from Mitha Tiw\u00e1na, specimens have been seen which show an average of skill in work and design at least equal to that of most rural districts. Some account of the ornaments worn will be found in Chapter I. C.\n\nGood embroidered shoes are made at Jabba and Anga.\n\nA cow\u2019s hide is the most generally useful, being strong and soft; a good one is worth Rs. 6. A buffalo\u2019s hide is the strongest of all, but very hard. It is used for shoe-soles, &c., worth about Rs. 9. A camel\u2019s hide is too hard for most purposes, but is used for making ghi kupp\u00e1s: value Rs. 4. A bullock\u2019s hide is inferior in usefulness to a cow\u2019s hide. A horse\u2019s hide is scarcely of any use at all, being too thin and fine. A goat\u2019s hide is useful for parts of women\u2019s shoes, &c.: value about Re 1-8-0. The process of preparing a hide is as follows:\u2014The skin is soaked a day and a night in water, then taken out and scraped; then spread hair downwards on straw, and after rubbing the upper side with one chhit\u00e1k of saji and one-and-a-half s\u00e9r of lime, and a little water, it is tied up with the saji and lime inside. It is\n\n*There is one specially fine example of a whole house faced with carved wood here; the door-pans have very spirited designs representing elephants, camels, artillery and cavalry in marching order, boxing matches, &c.\nthen soaked for six days in two s\u00e9r of lime and water after which it is rubbed on both sides with broken-up earthenware. This is repeated at intervals till the hair is all off. It is then taken out, well washed and scraped, and has now become an adhauri, or untanned leather. The tanning process then begins. Well-bruised kikar bark (jand is also used, but not considered so good) is soaked in water and the hide thrown in. When the tanning has left the bark, fresh bark is put in. This takes some days, after which the hide is sewn up with muni, an aperture being left at one end, and hung up, the open end being uppermost. It is then half filled with bruised bark and water poured in, which, as it drops out, is caught in a vessel and poured back into the skin; this is continued until the lower part, when pricked, shows the colour of leather. The open end is then sewn up, the other end opened, the skin inverted, and the process repeated with fresh bark, until the whole is tanned. The skin is then well washed, rubbed with the hand and dried in the sun. It is then soaked in water with bruised mad\u00e1r plants. Til oil is then rubbed over it, and it is again soaked a day in water. Then dried, sprinkled with water, rolled up, and beaten with clubs. It is then rubbed on the flesh side with a stick, called a we\u00e4ng, made from the wild caper (capparis aphylla): the whole process in the hot weather takes about twenty-six days; in the cold, about eight days longer. Just before the skin is used, it is soaked for a day in little water with a chhit\u00e1k of alum, four chhit\u00e1ks of pomegranate bark, a chhit\u00e1k of salt and a chhit\u00e1k of til oil. During the day it is several times well twisted.\n\nIn Khush\u00e1b are made jars and drinking vessels of earthenware which are much prized, as is the earthenware of Surakki in the Salt Range. The blacksmiths of Kufri are also noted for their ironwork.\n\nThere is a considerable manufacture of gunpowder in the district at Bhera, Khush\u00e1b, Shahpur and other towns; the number of licensed manufacturers in 1915 was 32, and the total output about 385 maunds. It is made by mixing saltpetre, sulphur and charcoal in proportions varying with the quality of powder desired; the most usual proportions being a maund of saltpetre to 5 s\u00e9r of sulphur and 10 s\u00e9r of charcoal. These ingredients are mixed together and pounded in a wooden mortar (chattu), and when well mixed the powder is put in the sun to dry. It is then ground in a hand-mill (chakki), damped and rolled in a basket (chajj) till it forms grains of gunpowder. More than 300 maunds is exported from the district for use on public works as blasting-powder, and most of the rest is consumed\nin making fireworks, of which the people are very fond, quantities being let off on occasions of marriages or other rejoicings. The fireworks of this district are generally very good and are of several different varieties of which the most common are the gol\u00e1, the only merit of which is that it goes off with a loud noise like a cannon, the \u00e1sm\u00e1n\u00ed gol\u00e1 which on bursting in the air falls in colored globes of fire; the an\u00e1r which resembles a fountain of fiery sparks; the chakkar or wheel; the mat\u00e1b or colored light; and the hawa or squib.\n\nSoap is manufactured on a small scale in Khush\u00e1b in the following manner. A maund of kh\u00e1r (sajji) and 20 s\u00e9r of lime are pounded up together and put into an earthenware vessel (mat) in the bottom of which a hole, the size of one's little finger, is made. Water is poured on the mixture and filters through the hole at the bottom where it is caught in other vessels. This solution is mixed with a maund of sesamum oil (til k\u00e1 tel) and 10 s\u00e9r of fat, which have previously been heated and mixed up together. This mixture is allowed to stand for three days and then heated for two hours till soap forms on the surface, leaving the water below. The soap is then skimmed off and put into moulds; about 1\u00bd maunds of soap being got from the above quantities of the ingredients. Six families of Khoj\u00e1s are engaged in this business and make about 300 maunds of soap in a year.\n\nThere are 13 factories registered under the Factory Act in this district; their local distribution is shown in the margin; at the present moment only 4 in Sargodha and 2 in Bhalwal are working, 2 of those in Sargodha combining flour-milling with cotton ginning and pressing, and the remainder only ginning and pressing. Of the total number 1 is a foundry, and also does flour-milling and rice-husking in addition to ginning and pressing; 3 others combine flour-milling, rice-husking or oil-pressing with ginning and pressing; 4 do ginning and pressing only; and 5 do ginning only. There are also a certain number of unregistered factories, such as the ice factory at Sargodha, a ginning factory at Phularw\u00e1n, and a press at Jhawari\u00e1n, and there are several small oil engines working oil, and flour mills throughout the district. There is an important water-mill on the fall at the point where the Sulki Branch crosses the Shahpur-Sargodha road, which grinds the corn for Sargodha town.\n\nThe registered factories now at work are said to employ 466 men and 55 women, while those out of work normally employ\n320 men and 47 women. No children are employed. This shows a slight advance on the numbers reported at the Industrial Census in 1911. The cotton-ginning concerns which do not also do any form of milling or oil-pressing are only seasonal in their working, and the labour they employ is really casual. It cannot be said that the population of the district has up to now gone far towards becoming industrialized.\n\nAt the same time there has been a very general substitution of simple forms of mechanical power for hand-labour. Nearly every large village has its kar\u00e1s or grinding machine; these are generally owned by carpenters, who grind the corn or press the oil for the villagers and take a s\u00e9r in the maund. The water-mills in the Katha gorge are an ancient institution, and do a thriving business; Jabbi and Khabakki have started similar industries, and Sodhi Jai Wali is trying to follow suit. There is a great future for tube-wells worked by crude-oil engines, if only some enterprising person can be induced to make a start, and a repairing and inspecting agency can be arranged. The Director of Agriculture is considering the merits of the solar-motors in use in Egypt, with special reference to the conditions of Khush\u00e1b Tahs\u012bl.\n\nSection F.\u2014Commerce and Trade.\n\nThe general character of the trade of the district may be described as consisting in the export of agricultural and pastoral products and the import of such necessaries as cannot be produced locally, and what would formerly have been considered luxuries. The export of salt, coal, limestone, soap, gunpowder, etc., have already been described; they are of minor importance as compared with the trade in wheat, cotton, oilseeds, wool and hides.\n\nFrom time immemorial the bulk of the trade has been focussed on the large towns\u2014Bhera, Mi\u00e1ni, Khush\u00e1b, S\u00e1h\u00edw\u00e1l\u2014and these still retain some of their old importance. But since the development of the Jhelum Canal and the opening of the Malakw\u00e1l-Shorkot Road Railway, the centres of trade have shifted to the series of colony-marts or mand\u00eds which have been built simply to facilitate the export of produce to Kar\u00e1chi. These mand\u00eds are at Phularw\u00e1n, Bhalwal, Sargodha, and Sillanw\u00e1li, and are privately managed by committees of chaudhr\u00eds. Generally speaking the cultivator sells his produce to a local trader, who transports it to the market, and sells it to one of the European export firms (Ralli Brothers, Louis Dreyfus, Sandy Patrick, etc.)\nor some large native merchant, through a broker (ahrti). About 20 per cent. of the produce is taken direct to market by the cultivators, and one landlord (Naw\u00e1b Mub\u00e1riz Kh\u00e1n) deals direct with the export firm. The broker will, if necessary, store the produce until it can be sent to Kar\u00e1chi, charging rupee 1 per 100 bags for storage; he will also advance money, charging interest at rates varying from 10 annas to rupee 1 per cent. per mensem. From \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) to \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) per cent. is charged as commission on sales, \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) per cent. for brokerage, \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\) or occasionally \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) per cent. for weighment, and Rs. 2-9-0 per 100 bags for portage and stocking. The export firms allow from 2 to 4 per cent. of barley in the wheat, and \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) per cent. of dirt; if this standard is exceeded half the value of the excess barley and the full value of the excess dirt are deducted, but higher prices are paid for wheat which is cleaner than the standard.\n\nSome idea of the relative importance of the agricultural products exported will be gained from these figures of sales in the mand\u00eds for the last two years:\n\n| Year | Products | Phulawan | Bhalwad | Sargodha | Sialkot |\n|------|----------|---------|---------|----------|--------|\n|      |          | Mds.    | Rs.     | Mds.     | Rs.    | Mds.   | Rs.   |\n| 1914 | Wheat    | 126,695 | 3,55,852| 390,098  | 14,16,238| 740,050| 29,60,200| 246,684| 9,86,734|\n|      | Turia    | 68,534  | 3,32,009| 211,184  | 9,40,465 | 235,000| 10,12,500| 75,000 | 3,37,600|\n|      | Cotton (uncleaned) | 58,308 | 6,23,173| 85,402  | 5,85,070 | 15,000 | 61,000  | 6,000  | 27,000 |\n|      | Gram     | 4,227   | 12,156  | 14,256  | 48,372  | 14,000 | 42,000  | 4,000  | 14,000 |\n|      | Maize    |        |         |         |         | 2,500 | 7,500   | 833    | 2,500  |\n|      | Millets  | 734     | 2,348   | 1,617   | 5,503   | 2,000 | 6,000   | 1,000  | 3,000  |\n|      | Wheat    | 110,350 | 4,34,348| 265,010 | 9,03,035| 1,100,000| 33,00,000| 366,666| 11,00,000|\n|      | Turia    | 36,067  | 1,63,487| 109,164 | 4,39,712| 675,000| 30,37,500| 225,000| 10,03,000|\n|      | Cotton (uncleaned) | 43,451 | 1,98,574| 56,024 | 2,95,072| 30,000 | 1,44,000| 12,000 | 48,000 |\n| 1915 | Gram     | 3,618   | 11,279  | 3,405   | 12,570  | 20,000 | 50,000  | 6,880  | 16,888 |\n|      | Maize    |        |         |         |         | 2,700 | 6,750   | 900    | 3,250  |\n|      | Millets  | 751     | 1,733   | 1,540   | 5,450   | 1,000 | 3,500   | 900    | 3,250  |\n\nThis shows that about Rs. 1,00,00,000 worth of the six main staples are sold at these four mand\u00eds in a year, and the bulk of this produce goes to Kar\u00e1chi. There is of course also considerable traffic on the other branches of the railway; wheat from the Salt Range and the Jhelum valley, gram from the Thal, cotton cloth from Khush\u00e1b, mehdi from Bhera, wool, ghi, hides and bones.\nfrom all stations, are all largely exported. The total figures of export and import for the 10 years ending 1910 on the Bhera branch line and the Sind-S\u00e1gar Line stations of this district are as follows:\n\n| Total Traffic in Maunds (1901\u20141910) |\n|-------------------------------------|\n| Exported | Imported |\n| Bhera line | ... | ... | 6,606,739 | 10,755,896 |\n| Sind-S\u00e1gar line | ... | ... | 6,564,901 | 2,109,865 |\n\nThe imports are almost entirely brought by rail and consist mainly of piece-goods and metals from Europe, sugar from Si\u00e1lkot and rice from Pesh\u00e1war. During the cold season travelling merchants from Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n bring down majith (madder), fruits, spices, gold coins, &c., some portion of which they sell in this district on their way through.\n\nIn seasons of drought, such as 1907, 1911, 1915, large quantities of fodder are brought in by rail from Lyallpur and other colonies (including the Jhelum Colony) to the Khush\u00e1b Tahs\u00edl, and full use is made of the concession rates granted by Government on these occasions.\n\nThe railway has, of course, greatly reduced the amount of river-borne trade, but it is estimated that in a normal year about 5,000 maunds of wheat and 10,000 maunds of gram go down by boat from Khush\u00e1b, Girot, and other points further downstream to Jhang and Muzaffargarh. At least 12,000 maunds of salt, and about 1,000 maunds of barilla, sugar, mehd\u00ed, spices, etc., are exported in a year in the same way, while there is also a certain amount of traffic in pottery and wooden articles of furniture\u2014spinning-wheels, bedsteads, cots and so forth. Timber in large quantities is drifted down the Jhelum to the d\u00e9p\u00f4ts at Chak Niz\u00e1m and Khush\u00e1b, and it is said that in 1915 Khush\u00e1b contractors bought up supplies worth Rs. 1,00,000.\n\nIt is clear from what has been said that the district exports goods of far greater value than it imports. In addition to this there is a considerable sum of money annually paid to residents of\nthe district in the form of pay and pensions by Government. So many recruits have joined, and are still joining, the army since the outbreak of war, that it is impossible to state the exact amount received as pay by soldiers, but before the war broke out more than six lakhs of rupees were drawn by residents of this district as pay from the Military Department, and Rs. 1,17,310 were drawn as military pensions. About one lakh of rupees was drawn by residents of the district employed within the district by Civil Departments and local bodies, and a considerable sum must be added to this for the pay drawn by persons serving elsewhere who remit their pay to their homes in this district. Civil pensions amount to over Rs. 63,000. Altogether 10 lakhs of rupees is a cautious estimate of the amount annually paid to residents of the district in the form of pay and pensions.\n\nSection G.\u2014Means of Communication.\n\nThe progress of railway construction has been briefly indicated in Chapter I, Section B. The district is now served by (a) the Jech-Do\u00e1b Branch of the North-Western Railway, which passes through the greatest length of the Jhelum Canal Colony and gives through connection with Kar\u00e1chi via Shorkot Road, Kh\u00e1new\u00e1l and Lodhr\u00e1n; (b) the Sind-S\u00e1g\u00e1r Branch of the same railway, which passes through the greatest breadth of Khush\u00e1b Tahs\u00edl, and gives through connection with Kar\u00e1chi, via Kundi\u00e1n and Sher Shah; (c) the Bhera Branch which joins Bhera and Mi\u00e1ni to the junction of the other two branches at Malakw\u00e1l. There is every prospect of a new broad-gauge line being built from R\u00e1ewind to Khush\u00e1b, and this will link up Sargodha, Shahpur and Khush\u00e1b by an almost straight line with Bhatinda and Delhi. There is also a scheme (not yet sanctioned), for a narrow-gauge line from Bhera to Shahpur. When these lines have been constructed, the only parts of the district not within easy reach of a railway will be the Chenab Circle of Bhera Tahs\u00edl, the river valley about S\u00e1hiw\u00e1l, the Southern Thal, and the Hills. The last-named tract will necessarily have always to rely on camels and donkeys to bring its wheat down to the plains, unless something in the nature of a ropeway can be devised.\n\nThe most obvious effect of the existing railway system has been that it has banished the fear of famine, and has done away with purely local fluctuations of prices. In the days before railways and canals existed, the district was entirely at the mercy of the rainfall; if the rain failed, food for man and beast was not to be had for any money: if the rains were good, grain and fodder\nwere drugs in the market. It was the sudden fall in prices that rendered the first summary settlements unworkable; now-a-days it is only a fall in the world-price that can seriously affect the district.\n\nIt cannot be said that improved communications have affected language or religion, though the popularity of railway metaphors in common speech may be noticed.\n\nFor a district of such size and wealth Shahpur is singularly ill-supplied with metalled roads. There is a good metalled road from Khush\u00e1b station through the bazaar to the river bank, and on from the far bank to Sargodha and thence to Bhagt\u00e1nw\u00e1la. The road from S\u00e1rgodha to S\u00e1h\u00edw\u00e1l has been metalled for half its length, and the road from Sargodha to Lakk and about a quarter of the distance from Lakk to Kalra is also metalled. Altogether there are nearly 81 miles of metalled road in the district, and another 5 miles (from Sill\u00e1nw\u00e1li in the direction of S\u00e1h\u00edw\u00e1l) are in course of construction. There is a fine unmetalled road running parallel to the Jhelum river from Gujr\u00e1t to Jhang, through Mi\u00e1ni, Bhera, Chak R\u00e1m D\u00e1s, Jhawari\u00e1n, Shahpur Civil Station, and S\u00e1h\u00edw\u00e1l: there is a less good road on the opposite side of the river from Pindi D\u00e1dan Khan, through Rajar, Khush\u00e1b, Girot and Khai Kal\u00e1n. From Khush\u00e1b there are roads of a sort to Darya Khan and Mi\u00e1nw\u00e1li, by way of Mitha Tiw\u00e1na. There are roads more or less passable for light vehicles from Gunjiy\u00e1l, Khush\u00e1b and Rajar stations to the foot of the hills, leading to good riding roads up the face of the Range. There are tolerable riding roads joining up all the main villages of the Hill Circle. There are also feeder roads joining the river valleys to the Jech-Do\u00e1b railways, of which those from Midh R\u00e1njha and Kot Moman, Bhera and Chak R\u00e1m D\u00e1s to Bhalwal; Jhawari\u00e1n via Kalra to Sargodha; and S\u00e1h\u00edw\u00e1l to Sargodba and Sill\u00e1nw\u00e1li are the most important. The old high road from Shahpur to Lahore, via Mitha Lakk and Pindi Bhatti\u00e1n, is not much used now, nor is the old road from Shahpur to Mari Lakk, and Kot Moman. The canal roads are all good, but not open to general traffic.\n\nThere are altogether 1,142 miles of unmetalled road maintained by the District Board. Generally speaking these roads are in most places and at most seasons more or less fit for wheeled traffic. Table 30 shows the certified distances between most of the principal places in the district.\nTable 29 gives a list of all rest-houses in or near the district, with the amount and nature of accommodation in each, and the department to which each belongs. Since 1911 new civil rest-houses have been built at Pail and Naushehra in the Salt Range, each containing one living-room, and two bed-rooms with bath rooms, and with a cook-house, two stables, and servants' quarters attached. The situation of these rest-houses is shown in the maps accompanying this volume.\n\nThere are encamping-grounds of the Military Department along the main lines of route as shown below:\n\n(1) Jhang to Gujrat\u2014Nihang, Sahiwal, Wadhi, Shahpur, Jhawarian, Chak Ram Das, Bhera, Mi\u00e1ni.\n\n(2) Lahore to Dera Ismail Khan\u2014Laksin, Bhagtanwala, Mitha Lakk or Sargodha, Dhrema, Shahpur, Khush\u00e1b, Had\u00e1li, Mitha Tiw\u00e1na, Adhi Sargal.\n\n(3) Lahore to Bannu.\u2014As for No. (2) as far as Mitha Tiw\u00e1na and thence to Gunjiy\u00e1l.\n\nThere are also encamping-grounds at Nurew\u00e1la and Katha Masral at the foot of the Salt Range on the roads from Khush\u00e1b to Sakesar, and from Khush\u00e1b or Kajar to Talagang.\n\nIt has been shown in the preceding section that there is still a certain amount of river-borne traffic on the Jhelum, Khush\u00e1b being the principal centre of trade. (There is no traffic of importance on the Chenab.) There are 180 boats in the district, as against 238 at last settlement. The ferries on the Chenab and those on the Jhelum above Kohli\u00e1n are managed by the authorities of Gujranwala and Jhelum Districts respectively. Of those shown in the margin, Khush\u00e1b is managed by the Deputy Commissioner, and the remainder by the District Board, and the right to collect the tolls was leased by them in 1915 for the sums shown against each. At Khush\u00e1b the ferry is during the cold weather replaced by a bridge of boats. There is a footway alongside of the Railway line on the Chak Niz\u00e1m bridge.\nA list of Post and Telegraph Offices is given in Table 31. There are now 17 sub-offices and 73 branch offices, as against 3 sub-offices and 43 branch offices in 1897. Table 32 shows that between 1891 and 1911 the number of articles received for delivery quadrupled, while the number of money orders paid and issued multiplied by 6 and 8 times respectively.\n\nBesides the telegraph offices shown in Table 31, which are at the principal market towns on the Railway, and at Shahpur and Sakesar, there are also offices at the other railway stations. The Canal Department has telegraphic communication all along the main Canal lines, including the Shahpur Branch. There is a direct line between Shahpur and Sargodha. The Sakesar office is closed during the cold weather. Telegraphic communication between Naushehra and Khush\u00e1b would greatly facilitate the administration of the Salt Range.\n\nSection H\u2014Famine.\n\nThe very fact that the rainfall of the district is always precarious has served as a protection against famine. In the old days the inhabitants of the B\u00e1r and Thal were constantly faced with the prospect of having to move off in search of pasture with their flocks and herds, while the dwellers in the river could rely on their wells for some sort of a living. To this day the same state of affairs prevails in Khush\u00e1b Tahsil; when the rains fail part of the population migrates to the Indus valley, or, if need be, Kashmir with the cattle, and the remainder go as labourers to Sargodha or some other colony, where good wages are always to be had, even in the river-circles a large number of cattle will be sold in these circumstances for very low prices; but real famine, involving relief-works, is unknown; suspension of the revenue gives all necessary relief. To this extent there may be said to have been famines in 1886-87, 1891-92, 1896-97, 1899-1900, 1904-05, 1907-08, 1911-12 and 1915-16. Of these the year 1899-1900 was the worst, for both before and after it there were a number of poor harvests which diminished the accumulations of grain and fodder in advance and prevented a speedy recovery. At the present moment (June 1916) the Thal has had practically no rain since early August 1915, and the villages are forsaken. Large quantities of fodder have been imported by rail for such cattle as could not be driven off to Kashmir. A large number of cattle were sold for little more than the value of their hides.\nCHAPTER III.\u2014ADMINISTRATIVE.\n\nSection A.\u2014Administrative Divisions.\n\nThe Shahpur District is under the control of the Commissioner and Superintendent of the Rawalpindi Division, whose head-quarters are at Rawalpindi. The ordinary head-quarters staff of the district, located at Sargodha, consists of the Deputy Commissioner, who is also District Magistrate, Collector and Registrar, one Assistant Commissioner, and three Extra Assistant Commissioners, of whom one is Treasury Officer and one is Revenue Assistant. The District and Sessions Judge also has his head-quarters at Sargodha, but some of the civil work of the Khush\u00e1b Tahsil is undertaken by the District and Sessions Judge of Mi\u00e1nw\u00e1li. There is an Extra Judicial Assistant Commissioner as Sub-Judge, and a Subordinate Judge presides over the small cause court. The Khush\u00e1b Tahsil is in charge of a Sub-Divisional Officer whose head-quarters are at Shahpur. Each tahsil is in charge of a Tahsild\u00e1r, who ordinarily exercises the criminal powers of a second class Magistrate, the civil powers of a Munsiff of the third grade, and the revenue powers of an Assistant Collector of the second grade. He is assisted by a N\u00e1ib Tahsild\u00e1r with similar criminal and revenue powers. The Bhera Tahsil has also an additional N\u00e1ib Tahsild\u00e1r in charge of the sub-tahsil, which will, when the head-quarters of the tahsil are transferred to Bhalwal, be located at Bhera. In Sargodha Tahsil there is an additional N\u00e1ib Tahsild\u00e1r in charge of colony business.\n\nThe Revenue Record Staff, working under a District K\u00e1n\u00fango with one assistant, is of the strength shown below:\n\n| Tahsil | Office K\u00e1n\u00fangos | Field K\u00e1n\u00fangos | Patw\u00e1r\u00eds | Assistant patw\u00e1r\u00eds |\n|--------|-----------------|----------------|----------|--------------------|\n| Bhera  | 1               | 5              | 76       | 3                  |\n| Shahpur| 1               | 4              | 78       | 3                  |\n| Sargodha| 1             | 4              | 51       | 3                  |\n| Khush\u00e1b| 1               | 4              | 75       | 8                  |\n\nDistrict | 4 | 17 | 275 | 17\n\nThe patw\u00e1r\u00eds are graded on one list for the district, as shown in the margin. The assistant patw\u00e1r\u00eds each receive Rs. 8 per month. An experiment is now being made in Sargodha Tahsil, by which the number of Revenue patw\u00e1r\u00eds is being reduced, and the Canal Department patw\u00e1r\u00eds do all the work of crop inspection which was previously done by both...\ndepartments. In the river circles of Shahpur and Bhera, and in the whole of Khush\u00e1b Tahs\u012bl, the vagaries of the river, the existence of privately-owned inundation canals, and the rapidity with which b\u00e1r\u00e1ni cultivation and partitions of common land are proceeding, combine to tax to the utmost the energies of the revenue staff.\n\nThere are three Munsiffs for the trial of civil judicial cases, holding court at Bhera, Shahpur and Sargodha.\n\nThe official staff of the district is assisted by the following Honorary Magistrates and Judges:\n\n| Name of gentleman exercising judicial powers | Nature of jurisdiction exercised |\n|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Fazal Ilahi, Shaikh                         | Criminal powers.                |\n| Pir Biddahab                               | Civil powers.                   |\n| Lala Devi Diyal Shah                        |                                |\n| M.

Even in the Salt Range, where a democratic spirit and village autonomy were more developed, certain families have been recognized as qualified to take the lead in public affairs. But in many villages the appointment of village headmen must have been a very difficult or arbitrary proceeding. It must often have been much easier to say which out of several village headmen was best entitled to be appointed halqadar than to say which of the many landowners within the village should be appointed headman.\n\nAt regular settlement certain allowances were given to leading members of the agricultural community in the form of a percentage on the assessment of the estates with which they were connected, to be deducted from the land revenue before payment into the Treasury. In return for these allowances they were expected in a general way to use their influence in their own and neighbouring villages in order to put down crime and aid in the general administration. In 1886 advantage was taken of the powers given by Revenue Rule 174 to define their duties and fix their responsibilities by putting each inamd\u00e1r in charge of a circle of villages and requiring him to perform all the duties of a saild\u00e1r within that circle. This system was found to be of great advantage in all branches of the local administration. And the eagerness shown not only by the inamd\u00e1rs themselves, but by candidates for the post among the more influential headmen, to distinguish themselves by assisting the various officers of Government who come into their neighbourhood, rendered work of all sorts among the villages much more thorough and satisfactory. It has however now been decided to carry this improvement out to its logical conclusion by introducing a regular system of zails. The number of zails sanctioned for each tahsil is as shown in the margin; there are also in addition to the stipendiary zail-\n\n| Bhera | ... | 15 |\n|-------|-----|----|\n| Shahpur | ... | 11 |\n| Khush\u00e1b | ... | 23 |\n| Sargodha | ... | 15 |\n| Total | ... | 64 |\n\ndaars four honorary zaild\u00e1rs, Malik Sher Muhammad N\u00fan in Bhera, and Maliks Umar Hay\u00e1t Kh\u00e1n, Muhammad Mub\u00e1riz Kh\u00e1n, and Khuda Bakhsh Kh\u00e1n in Shahpur who perform the duties of zaild\u00e1r within the estates owned by themselves or their near relations. The saild\u00e1rs are assisted by 54 in\u00e1mkhors, some of whom understudy the zaild\u00e1r within a particular portion of the zail, while others act as assistants throughout the zail. The sanctioned emoluments and numbers of each grade are shown...\nbelow. The Deputy Commissioner can make the distribution over tahsils as he likes:\n\n| Administrative Divisions | 1st Grade | 2nd Grade | 3rd Grade |\n|--------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Zailddars and Inamkhors  | Rs. per annum | Number | Rs. per annum | Number | Rs. per annum | Number |\n| Zailddars                | 30        | 17       | 250       | 23     | 200         | 24     |\n| Inamkhors                | 120       | 10       | 100       | 24     | 80          | 20     |\n\nIn one or two cases, individuals who were formerly halqadars and are now inamkhors are permitted for their life-time to draw the same amount of inam as they were doing under the old scheme, even though that amount be in excess of a 1st grade inam. A list of zailddars and inamkhors is given in Appendix II, but the grading has so far only been announced provisionally, and is liable to be reconsidered at the end of the present war.\n\nAt regular settlement, especially in the Khushab Tahsil, settled by Captain Davies, a systematic plan was carried out for reducing the number of village headmen, which had in the summary settlements been allowed to increase, with hardly any check, to a reasonable figure, so that they might form a class possessed of some weight and authority in the country. The opportunity of the first revision was taken by large numbers of the men who were then brought under reduction or their representatives to push their claims to reinstatement, and several hundreds of applications from such men and from new claimants demanding an increase in the number of headmen were presented. Very few of these were accepted, as it is undoubtedly an advantage to the administration to have the power, influence and responsibility of the village headmen confined to as few hands as possible. Where the number was increased it was on the ground that some well-marked division of the village landowners had been hitherto unrepresented, and was important enough to deserve a separate headman of its own. Headmen were also appointed in a number of new estates where none had hitherto been appointed, and of course each colony chak has been put under one or more headmen. At the recent revision a statement was prepared to show in what villages the number of headmen was still excessive, and proposals were made for reducing them as vacancies occur. This statement (in vernacular) is in the\nDeputy Commissioner's office. The total number of headmen in the district is now\u2014Tahsil Bhera, 607; Shahpur, 427; Khush\u00e1b, 284; Sargodha, 370; total 1,688, and averages about 1\u00bd to each estate excluding forests, and about one to every Rs. 1,200 of land revenue. The average income of a headman from fees on the land revenue, water-advantage-rate and water-rates is about Rs. 100 per annum.\n\nIn addition to the usual emoluments in the form of a cess on the land revenue and water rate, the headmen in Colony villages also have received grants of land, aggregating 7,197 acres; such squares are resumed without compensation when a headman dies.\n\nA rough idea of the relative importance of the land-owning tribes may be got from the number of headmen of each tribe as shown in the following statement, in which, however, the number of Hindu headmen is unduly swelled by the figures for Bhera town where many of them are headmen of only one or two wells:\n\n| Tribe     | Bhera | Shahpur | Khush\u00e1b | Sargodha | Total |\n|-----------|-------|---------|---------|----------|-------|\n| Ahir      | 2     | 5       | 5       |          | 12    |\n| Aw\u00e1n      | 27    | 9       | 108     | 23       | 167   |\n| Baloch    | 1     | 50      | 23      | 10       | 84    |\n| Jat       | 320   | 32      | 34      | 178      | 560   |\n| Kamboh    | 5     | 8       |         | 1        | 14    |\n| Khokhar   | 48    | 30      | 33      | 9        | 120   |\n| Path\u00e1n    | 17    | 13      | 5       | 10       | 45    |\n| Qureshi   | 5     | 12      | 9       | 3        | 29    |\n| R\u00e1jp\u00fat    | 52    | 224     | 50      | 81       | 407   |\n| Sayyad    | 25    | 28      | 12      | 9        | 74    |\n| Khatri    | 42    | 1       |         | 13       | 55    |\n| Arora     | 3     | 7       | 3       | 5        | 15    |\n| Brahmin   | 9     | 1       |         |          | 12    |\n\nDetail of Jats and R\u00e1jp\u00fats.\n\n| Tribe     | Bhera | Shahpur | Khush\u00e1b | Sargodha | Total |\n|-----------|-------|---------|---------|----------|-------|\n| Gondal    | 76    | 5       |         | 3        | 84    |\n| R\u00e1ujha    | 82    |         |         |          | 82    |\n| Mekan     | 1     | 48      |         |          | 54    |\n| Tiw\u00e1na    | 14    |         | 25      |          | 45    |\n| Sikh      | 4     |         |         | 28       | 32    |\n| Bhatti    | 3     | 6       | 2       | 18       | 29    |\n| War\u00e1ich   | 12    |         |         | 18       | 25    |\n| N\u00fan       | 16    | 8       |         |          | 24    |\n| Kale\u00e1r    | 3     | 8       |         | 12       | 23    |\n| Jhammat   | 3     | 18      | 1       |          | 22    |\n| Janjuha   | 6     | 2       | 8       | 5        | 21    |\n| Rihan     | 16    | 1       |         |          | 17    |\n| Hatar     | 4     | 13      |         |          | 17    |\n| Joya      |       | 5       | 11      |          | 16    |\n| Nissow\u00e1na | 9     |         |         |          | 15    |\n| Nagy\u00e1na   | 2     | 7       |         |          | 14    |\nIn every estate a *w\u00e1jib-ul-arz* or village administration paper has been included in the record of rights, and sets forth in detail the rules adopted by the villagers for the settlement of such questions as may be answered by each village as it thinks fit, e.g., the management of the common-lands, the collection of grazing fees, the distribution of the water brought down by torrents or springs, or the collection of petty taxes or cesses for purely local purposes.\n\nA complete report on the various cesses realised in the district was submitted with Deputy Commissioner's No. C. dated 20th September 1892, and has been separately printed. In some 30 estates in the north of Khush\u00e1b Tahs\u00edl a special rate of 5 per cent. on the land revenue was imposed by Captain Davies on outsiders who had obtained a proprietary footing in the estate, and conferred on a selected headman under the name of *hak \u00e1la lambard\u00e1ri* in addition to his ordinary remuneration of 5 per cent. as headman. By Government's No. 196, dated 8th October 1893, it was held that this is not a cess at the disposal of Government but a *talukd\u00e1ri* due belonging to the whole proprietary body. The orders accordingly were that unless the proprietary body wished to have a special entry made in the administration paper saying that these *talukd\u00e1ri* dues are to be made over to a headman to be nominated from time to time by Government, then no entry whatever beyond the entry providing for the levy from the inferior proprietors of the *talukd\u00e1ri* due should be made. In no case did the proprietors agree to leave this income to one headman to be selected by Government, and it has therefore simply been stated in the administration paper of these estates that the due is leviable from the inferior proprietors (*m\u00e1l\u00edk\u00e1n kabz\u00e1*) without stating to whom it is payable.\n\nIn 1850, shortly after annexation, it was reported that in this district as elsewhere in Northern India a custom prevailed by which the village artisans either made a small payment in money or rendered some service in the line of their own particular occupation to the proprietors of the village in which they resided. In Sikh times the proceeds of this tax were realised as part of the income of the State; but the British Government relinquished it to the landowners. At regular settlement it was recorded as levied in 393 of the 667 estates in the district, and in almost all those estates it is still in force. It is ordinarily charged on weavers, washermen, butchers, cobblers, carpenters, blacksmiths, potters, silversmiths and barbers, but not on Brahmans, musicians, shop-keepers or sweepers. It is in\nfact a tax on artisans and is called *kamidna* from *kami*, a worker. Moreover when a man of the artisan class gives up his caste occupation and becomes an agriculturist he is exempted from the tax. The rates charged vary considerably in different villages, but the most common rate is two rupees per annum payable half-yearly by each adult male working at a trade, boys and aged men being let off with a lower rate. The total realisations for the whole district amount to about Rs. 11,000 yearly. The tax is generally realised by the village headmen through their private accountant (*dharw\u0101r\u012b*) and applied to the payment of the village watchman's salary, or credited to the fund for common village expenses, or in some cases appropriated by the headmen or the landowners of the village. It is in many villages strongly objected to by the artisans, who are generally led on by the weavers, and is evidently felt as a galling poll-tax, realised by the landowning class as a mark of superiority from the artisan class.\n\n*Molba* is the name given to the fund for common expenses of the village, and the *malba* cess is a cess levied for common purposes from the revenue payers in proportion to the land revenue payable by each. At regular settlement in all the papers of villages settled by Mr. Ouseley one uniform condition was recorded to the effect that only the following items should be chargeable to the village, viz., fees on warrants for realisation of arrears, the patw\u0101r\u012b's writing materials, cost of feeding indigent travellers, and expenditure incurred by headmen when employed on business connected with the village,\u2014the total expenditure not to exceed 5 per cent. Captain Davies, on the other hand, entered the *malba* at a fixed percentage on the assessment of the estate, generally at the following rates:\u2014viz., 5 per cent., where the assessment does not exceed Rs. 500; 4 per cent., from Rs. 500 to Rs. 1,000; 3 per cent. from Rs. 1,000 to Rs. 2,000; and 2 per cent. where the assessment exceeds Rs. 2,000. In these estates settled by Captain Davies the practice was for the headmen to realise the percentage fixed at settlement, and spend it pretty much as they liked. Dissatisfaction with the administration of the common fund is frequently expressed, and it is difficult to check the accounts. At Mr. Wilson's revision it was held that it was not advisable to interfere with long-standing custom, and the previous arrangements were allowed to stand, the former entries regarding *malba* being repeated with the addition that the headmen are bound to keep an account of the income and expenses of the common fund with some shop-keeper in the village, which shall be open\nto the inspection of every revenue-payer, and every half-year to explain the accounts of the common fund to the whole body of revenue-payers. The only exception to this action was that in some estates in which the percentage fixed was not in accordance with the general scale, or for other reasons was unsuitable, a different percentage was fixed as the maximum rate to be collected. No changes were made at the recent revision except that in cases where the headmen asserted that in practice they collected only such amounts as the accounts showed to have been expended, this fact was noted. The patw\u00e1ri's stationery is no longer a charge on the malba.\n\nIn 86 villages of this district a sort of octroi tax, called dharath, is levied on all sales of village produce to outsiders and on all purchases of outside produce by residents of the village, the most common rates being a quarter of a ser per maund (= 10 annas per cent.) on sales of grain and one paisa per rupee (= Re. 1-9-0 per cent.) on the value of other articles. It is usual for the headmen to give a contract for the year to some shop-keeper in the village (dharw\u00e1di) who pays them a sum agreed on for the monopoly, and charges fees at the customary rates on all sales, the sellers being bound to come to him for weightment, and he in return being bound to weigh their goods for them. The income from this source aggregates about Rs. 2,800 per annum and is generally credited to the common fund or spent on such public objects as improving the village well or supplying oil to the village mosque and tobacco to the guest-house. In 57 villages a custom exists by which the landowners realise a tax, varying from Re. 1 to Rs. 7 on each marriage of a daughter of a non-proprietor. It is paid by the bridegroom's father and is called jhajri or sometimes bakri as it is often paid in the form of a goat or a sheep; and is appropriated by the owners of the land on which the bride's father lives or by the landowners on whom he is dependent.\n\nSection B.\u2014Civil and Criminal Justice.\n\nIn the foregoing section it has been said that the Deputy Commissioner is District Magistrate, and mention has been made of the official and honorary magistrates. The District Judge has also been mentioned, and the Civil Courts, which are subordinate to him, have been described.\n\nThe statistics for the work accomplished by the Civil and Criminal Courts will be found in tables 35 and 34. The total volume of civil litigation is not unduly great and most of it calls for no special remark. There are however one or two classes of\ncases special to this part of the Punjab, if not to this district. One is the class of cases (which may be either Civil or Criminal) arising out of the distribution of water flowing off the hills; another class arises out of a custom in the Thal which forbids the breaking up of waste land in the mah\u00e1z (i.e., so as to restrict the catchment) of a pre-existing field; the nature and extent of the rights of owners and non-owners in the common grazing lands of the Thal will also have to be threshed out in the Civil Courts. The recent settlement has not added very seriously to the number of suits for enhancement of rent, etc.\n\nIf allowance be made for the past history of the district its population is by no means seriously addicted to crime. The average number of persons imprisoned during the year has been 652 (including 20 females), or 9\u00bd per ten thousand of total population. It says much for the law-abiding character of the women of the district that each year only about one in ten thousand of them is convicted of an offence considered to deserve imprisonment.* The Hind\u00fas and Sikhs find their way into prison in much smaller proportion than the Musalm\u00e1ns, the proportion of convicts per ten thousand of total population being 4 for the former and 10 for the latter.\n\nThe character of the crimes committed is not such as to indicate any great moral depravity, but it shows that the peasantry are uncommonly hot-tempered, more so now than twenty years ago. On the average of the last five years 27 murders or attempts to murder have been reported. Serious riots are of somewhat frequent occurrence, about 60 taking place annually, but they are usually unpremeditated, and are often occasioned by a sudden quarrel about land boundaries, irrigation rights, trespassing of cattle, building of walls and similar common incidents of a peasant\u2019s life. The parties to the quarrel lose their tempers, and strike each other with sticks or stones, and their friends on either side cannot resist joining in; and as axes and agricultural implements are always handy and make deadly weapons of offence, it too often happens that one or more of the combatants receives a fatal blow. When the fight is over, all are sorry for what has happened and they try to make it up among themselves, so that it is often difficult for the police to get evidence sufficient to convict in such cases.\n\n* On the other hand there are far too many breaches of the unwritten law which custom has prescribed for maidens and young brides; these are not considered punishable by our Courts, but they have a disastrous effect upon the men\u2019s respect for law. There are many reflective inhabitants of the district who would amend this sentence to this effect: \u201cA singular aspect of the law enforced in the district is that each year only about one in ten thousand of the women is considered to deserve the punishment of imprisonment.\u201d\nIn 1897 the average number of murders or attempts to murder was only 12 per annum and of serious riots about 40, so it is clear that there is an increasing tendency on the part of aggrieved persons to take the law into their own hands, and that the majesty of the law is not sufficiently in evidence to deter them from resorting to violence. On the other hand the criminal courts are regrettably popular as a means of annoying neighbours who are not sufficiently offensive to be worthy of personal assault. These two tendencies\u2014to break heads on slight provocation and to make criminal complaints without cause\u2014interact on each other, greatly to the detriment of law and order. It will be seen from table 48 that about one case in four brought to trial results in acquittal or discharge; this is largely due to the frequency with which false charges are made; but the lively hope of escape encourages the hot tempered to bring their axes into play, and the apprehension that even a known murderer may easily be acquitted tempts the avengers of the victim to institute proceedings against all the connections of the real culprit, in order to ensure for them as much vicarious suffering as may be. Thus a vicious circle has been made, which can only be broken by a vigorous campaign against perjury.\n\nBy far the commonest cause of violent crime is sexual jealousy, or female emancipation. It has been shown in Chapter I, Section C, that marriageable girls are considered a valuable asset, and are generally not disposed of in marriage till they are well on in years. Sometimes the father or guardian of a girl waits too long, in the hope of getting a higher bride-price. In these cases the girl has generally set her affections on a man of her own choice, and if her father will not accept what he is prepared to offer, she will elope with him; sometimes the father persists in marrying her to a husband of his own choosing, and in these cases the bride will generally seize the earliest opportunity of making off with her lover. In either case there is all the material for a murder or else for a crop of cases, civil and criminal.\n\nThe only apparent effect on crime of the growth of the Jhelum Canal Colony has been an increased number of burglaries. The colonists are on the whole a law-abiding class, but they brought in their train as tenants and menials a certain number of undesirables, and the demand for cheap labour at harvest time draws a crowd of adventurers from the neighbouring tracts. To such as these the wealth of the colonist is a great temptation. The Jangli also, who now finds himself a substantial agriculturist, neighboured by other agriculturists, equally substantial but inexpert in the indigenous sport of cattle-lifting, cannot ignore so\neasy a prey, and finds a congenial relaxation from his unwonted labour in his ancient hobby.\n\nAlthough cattle theft is no longer easily first among the crimes of the district (for the last five years out of an average of 2,048 cognizable cases 184 were cases of cattle theft, as against 214 cases out of 1,005 in 1897) it still ranks next to burglary, with which crime it also overlaps.*\n\nIt is, as has been said, the traditional pastime and excitement of the cattle owners of the B\u00e1r, and until recently was not thought to deserve to be stigmatised as a crime. Indeed it is still the custom in some B\u00e1r villages not to invest any boy with the turban (pag) which is the sign of manhood until he has shown his title to the honour by stealing a bullock; often in case of unpleasant consequences he is allowed to steal an animal belonging to a near relative to whom it is afterwards restored. A man who will not have anything to do with cattle-theft is looked down upon as a mas\u00edlar, only fit to sit in a mosque (mas\u00edt). The cattle thieves of the B\u00e1r now find profitable employment in stealing bullocks from the colonists or the cultivators of the river valleys who are less skilled in this business than themselves. The thief (chor or kala) loiters about the village and finds out where the animals are fastened and how they are guarded, and, generally on a moonless night, makes a hole in the hedge (par) or in the wall (sannh) of the enclosure or house in which the cattle are kept, gets out the coveted animal, and drives it away as fast as he can, choosing, if possible, hard ground where no tracks will be left, or places frequented by other cattle where the marks of their feet (khur-chhi) are likely to obliterate those of the stolen animal. Sometimes to avoid the skill of the trackers he puts leather shoes (khussa) on the bullock so that it may not leave identifiable tracks, and he will sometimes put on and sometimes take off his own shoes with a similar object. When day breaks he leaves frequented paths, and drives the animal through the trackless jungle (ohj\u00e1r). When he nears a village in which some accomplice (rasseor) lives, he ties up the bullock in some secluded spot (ohr) in the jungle, goes to his friend and either shows him the animal or tells him where he will find it. The accomplice at nightfall takes the animal on to some other receiver of stolen cattle (rasseor), while the original thief returns home to disarm suspicion; and so the animal is passed on from hand to hand along a chain (rassa) of receivers, until it reaches a great distance from the place where it was stolen, and is thought to be\n\n*Thus out of 653 burglaries per annum (the average for the past five years), 112 were perpetrated for the sake of cattle, and these cases are not reckoned among cattle thefts.\nsafe from pursuit. A stolen animal rises in value as it gets away farther from its owner's home. Receivers generally try to forward stolen animals into another district so as to delay police enquiries and the thief generally gets his reward in the form of animals elsewhere. Stolen cattle generally are sent south or east into Jhang, Gujranwala, Gujrat, Mianwali, Lyallpur, Montgomery, Muzaffargarh and Ferozepore, stolen camels towards Jammu, and stolen horses towards Lahore, Ferozepore and Amritsar.\n\nShould the thief confine his operations to the B\u00e1r he commonly steals his animal while grazing in the jungle in the heat of the day or the darkness of the night, when the herds (chheru), generally boys or old men, are carelessly playing games in the shade or indulging in sleep. In such a case, the herd is often afraid to tell the owner of the theft and the owner does not discover that his animal has been stolen until some hours have elapsed.\n\nWhen the owner (s\u00e1in) learns his loss, he does not as a rule inform the police but proceeds to make up a private search-party consisting of a few of his own friends and one or two skilled trackers (khoi), of whom there are many in the B\u00e1r, some of them well acquainted with the tracks of the noted thieves of the neighbourhood. He shows the trackers the marks made by the stolen animal, and they proceed to hunt for its tracks (khure). When they find them, the party proceed to follow up the tracks as fast as possible. Sometimes they find the tracks made by the thief on his way to commit the theft and the tracker follows them up backwards (pichhure) to see where he came from. As they go along after the stolen animal, one of the party now and then ascends a high tree or other eminence to get a look out (tangu) for the thief in the jungle ahead. When they come near a village or meet any one in the jungle they make enquiries as to whether the stolen animal has been seen and sometimes identify the thief in this way. When they lose the tracks in unfavourable ground, they make a round (treth) in hopes of picking them up again. Some trackers are wonderfully skilful in following tracks and working out clues. Frequently they follow up and discover the stolen animal 50 miles or more from the place where it was stolen, the search having occupied several days. In one case a camel stolen from the Jhang District was tracked through Shahpur, Jhelum, Rawalpindi and Peshawar, and eventually recovered from the Khaibar. In another a mare stolen from near Shahpur was tracked across the Chenab, Ravi and Sutlej and found in Ferozepore District.\nWhen the animal itself cannot be found but the tracks have led to near some man's well or cultivated enclosure (vehr) in the jungle, the search party seize on him and demand its restoration. If he is guilty and the evidence strong against him, he will give it up (in which case it is called sagwan) or more frequently will get it conveyed as a strayed animal to some pound from which the owner can get it, or will give some other animal in exchange (wig or wignan) or purchase the owner's pardon by putting a shawl on the complainant's wife and calling her his sister. In such a case no malice is borne, but if he declines to return the animal or give some compensation and the owner still believes him guilty, a feud (rehd) results and the injured man watches his opportunity to get one of his enemy's cattle stolen in revenge or to do him some other injury. Should the accused person declare his innocence he is allowed to clear himself by the oath (nian or vis\u00e1\u00e1) of some respectable person in whom the owner of the stolen animal has confidence. This person, if after enquiry he is convinced of the innocence of the accused, will swear to his innocence in some mosque or kh\u00e1nq\u00e1h, the usual form of oath (soh) being somewhat as follows: \"God knows, the Prophet knows, and my soul knows, that this man is innocent and that he knows nothing about the theft.\"\n\nShould the track-party fail to find the animal, the owner sends word (ahr) to all his friends describing the brand and other marks of the stolen animal. When one of these men (markhitt), it may be years after, discovers the stolen animal, he informs the owner, and bargains with him for the price (markhai) of his information. He then takes him to the place where he saw the stolen animal, often a matter of some risk, as in the B\u00e1r stolen cattle are often kept apart from the rest in charge of strong herdsmen prepared to resent the approach of any one come to identify them (letu). When he finds it, he may either endeavour to recover it by force, by bargaining, or call in the aid of the police.\n\nMany, especially of the people of the B\u00e1r, consider it a point of honour not to call in the police till all other means have failed, so that many cases of cattle-theft are not reported at all, or are reported so late that it is impossible to obtain proof. There is, however, a growing tendency to invoke police aid, for although all are agreed that cattle-theft is becoming less common owing to the construction of canals and the spread of cultivation, the number of cases reported shows a tendency to increase. Some of the leading men of the B\u00e1r too are finding that it pays better to assist the authorities to put down cattle-theft than to share in the proceeds of successful thefts as a price for their aid or connivance.\nIn the Thal this laudable tendency has not yet become manifest to the same extent; and even in the B\u00e1r the sporting instinct sometimes outweighs the knowledge of what pays best. It was recorded by Mr. Wilson that \"the women also, apparently, do not quite approve of cattle theft, for they churn the milk of stolen animals and even of their offspring separately from that of animals honestly come by.\" In this respect there would seem to have been a regrettable back-sliding; this pleasing indication of an active conscience is now practically non-existent. In fact it must, unfortunately, be admitted that at the present rate of progress the total abolition of cattle-theft, and even its reduction to limits at all creditable to the administration, will take an unconscionable time.\n\nThere are 8 Barristers-at-Law practising in this district, and 28 Pleaders (10 first grade and 18 second grade). There are also three Revenue Agents of the second grade, entitled to practise in the court of the Commissioner, and all courts subordinate to him. The sanctioned scale of petition-writers is 15 of the first grade and 10 of the second, but the numbers actually practising are only 13 and 36, respectively. There is a Bar Association at Sargodha, but no Bar library.\n\nRegistration of deeds is mainly carried out by the non-official Sub-Registrars, who are Malik Muzaffar Kh\u00e1n at Shahpur, D\u00edw\u00e1n Jaw\u00e1hir Mal* at Bhera, Sard\u00e1r Bah\u00e1dur Kh\u00e1n at Khush\u00e1b, and Mi\u00e1n Muhammad Hay\u00e1t at Sargodha. All Tahsild\u00e1rs and N\u00e1ib Tahsild\u00e1rs are joint Sub-Registrars ex-officio. Detailed statistics will be found in Table 37. The number of deeds registered yearly averaged 1,820 in 1897; in 1902 the number was as low as 1,402, but since then it has risen fairly steadily; in 1909 it reached 2,008, and since then the average has been 1,702. The value of the property affected has increased greatly; in 1897 it averaged less than 8 lakhs of rupees; since 1910 it has averaged Rs. 14,411. The great majority of the deeds affect immovable property, so it is probable that (as the zam\u00edn-d\u00e1rs freely assert) the recorded value is considerably inflated to defeat pre-emptors.\u2020\n\n* Died since.\n\u2020 The pre-emption law gives rise to many quaint tales, two of which may be quoted as specimens; though their historical accuracy is not guaranteed, they are current among the villagers:\n(1) A Canal subordinate purchased land which was expecting irrigation from a perennial canal; being pre-empted out of his purchase, he reported the land to be too high for irrigation, and the pre-empting village has never got its water.\n(2) An artless rustic had sold some land to an outsider, who arranged to pay before the registering officer a very large sum, half of which was to be refunded so soon as the parties quitted the registry office. The rustic, suddenly finding himself in possession of undreamt of wealth, besought the officials to provide him with an escort as far as his home. The officials, quite capable of assisting in what was regarded as a good jest, arranged a safe-conduct for him, and the rustic is still wondering what he can do about it.\n### Section C.\u2014Land Revenue.\n\n| Tahsil | Reserved forest | Unallotted estates | Crown estates leased to colonists, lessees or tenants | Zamind\u0101r\u012b estates | Patt\u012bd\u0101r\u012b estates | Bhaiy\u0101ch\u0101ra estates | Total |\n|--------|----------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------|-------|\n| Bhera  | 3              | 61                 | 18                                                  | 205             | 287             |\n| Shahpur| 2              | 10                 | 33                                                  | 19              | 201             | 265               |\n| Khush\u00e1b| 74*            | 5                  | 1                                                   | 6               | 140             | 226               |\n| Sargodha|                | 10                 | 254                                                 | 7               | 31              | 292               |\n| **Total**| **79**         | **10**             | **330**                                             | **52**          | **32**          | **507**           | **1,070** |\n\n* In five reserved forests in Khush\u00e1b some temporary cultivation by annual tenants is permitted.\n\nThe foregoing table shows the number of estates held in the various forms of tenure in 1915. Considerable changes in the number of estates have been made at the recent revisions of settlement, owing chiefly to the creation into separate estates of grants of State land to individuals. At regular settlement the total number of estates, i.e., of areas for which a separate record of rights has been made, was returned as 647; now it is 1,070 of which 79 are reserved forests; 10 are unallotted Crown estates; and 330 are owned by Government, but allotted to lessees or colonists; of the remainder 52 are held on a joint zamind\u0101r\u012b tenure and 599 are held on the patt\u012bd\u0101r\u012b or bhaiy\u0101ch\u0101ra tenure, that is, the common land is owned on shares either according to fixed fractions or proportionate to the revenue paid by each individual owner. The prevailing tenure is the bhaiy\u0101ch\u0101ra where the extent of possession is the measure of each man's rights; and if reference be had to the past history of the country, and the system of revenue management under the Sikhs, to say nothing of the vicissitudes to which societies and families are subject even under the best ordered Government, it will not be a subject for surprise that such should have been the result.\nCaptain Davies in his report on the regular settlement thus describes the causes which led to this state of affairs:\n\n\"On the dissolution of the Mughal empire, anarchy for a long time prevailed, during which the country became the theatre of incessant fighting of tribe with tribe, varied by the incursions of the Afghans. To this succeeded the grinding rule of the Sikhs when, as has been very truly remarked, 'the tendency was rather to abandon rights, symbols more of misery than of benefit, than to contend for their exact definition and enjoyment,' and if these causes of themselves were insufficient to weaken the strong ties that bind the peasant to the soil of his fathers, the occurrence at times of famines and other calamities would concur in bringing about this result. Nor are these the only causes that would tend to disturb the original equilibrium even where this had ever existed. Our every-day experience tells us that the several members of a family are not equally gifted. One is provident another reckless: one is pushing and active, while another is altogether wanting in energy. It is needless to say, that while the former passes unscathed through ordeals such as have been described above, the latter is forced to succumb to them. Again under such a rule as the Sikhs, the former would probably succeed in making a friend of the ruler for the time being, and with his assistance would extend his possessions at the expense of his weaker brethren; and be it remembered there was ordinarily no redress should he presume on his influence to do this.\n\nAmong all the villages of the district, 66 only retain the communal form of tenure, all the others having lost, or retained only in the shape of vague forms even the relation that exists in patidari villages between ancestral right and the possession of land. In some few villages the relative rights of the members of the community according to the family genealogy are well known and could be accurately stated, but were found at the time of settlement not to have been acted upon for years, even for generations, and could not therefore be restored, the existing status being taken as the basis of operations. The distribution of the revenue among the members of a village accordingly is regulated solely by possession, each man paying upon the land held by him at rates varying according to the nature of the soil. In the Thal and Bar tracts, a portion of the revenue was thrown upon the cattle of the village, but this forms the only exception, common to all the district, to the rule as above stated. In the Bhera Tahsil during the Sikh rule a house-tax, called baha, of Rs. 2, used to be collected from all the residents in the village; and\nthe custom is still retained, a portion of the revenue being thrown by the people upon the houses and raised by a house rate, thus reducing the sum to be levied by grazing and soil rates.\"\n\nAt Mr. Wilson's revision of settlement it was found that the process of disintegration had continued. The number of estates held joint had decreased from 66 to 53; and the owners of very few estates desired to pay their land revenue in proportion to ancestral shares, in almost every estate the rule of distribution being that each owner should pay the land revenue chargeable on the land of his holding according to class and soil. This was the rule followed even in the case of land irrigated by wells, except in the Ar\u00e1 circle of the Shahpur Tahsil where the cultivation was almost entirely dependent on wells, and the ownership was by wells and land attached to them. In the estates of that circle and in a few others elsewhere the distribution of the revenue was made by putting a lump sum on each well and its block of land, this sum being distributed over the owners of the well in proportion to their shares in the ownership. As mentioned by Captain Davies, at regular settlement in the B\u00e1r villages a portion of the assessment was generally charged on the houses and another on the cattle of the village, but rights in the land had by this time become more valuable, and this mode of distribution was no longer desired by the people; so in all cases in that tract the whole assessment was charged on the owners of the land. In the Thal, however, it was still the general custom to charge a portion of the assessment on the cattle, the usual mode being to charge all the cropped area of the year at the uniform rate of four annas per acre except melons, which in some villages were exempted and in others charged at two annas per acre, and the remainder of the revenue was spread over all the cattle of the village, whether owned by landowners or others, in the following proportion: Camel 16, buffalo 8, cow or bullock 4, sheep or goat 1.\n\nThe third Regular Settlement has not brought to light any great change, so far as the old established estates are concerned. In the Ar\u00e1 circle well-cultivation has almost disappeared in the presence of perennial irrigation from the canal. The B\u00e1r is, except for an odd remnant here and there, fully irrigated, and pays all its revenue on the land. In the Thal a certain number of villages have elected to impose the whole demand upon the land, raising or lowering the rate per acre, according as cultivation expands or contracts; but the majority of the villages adhered to the old system, though the tendency is everywhere to take\na greater share from the land and less from the cattle. In the Mohar Circle several villages have set aside a fixed sum to be recovered from the owners of cattle, but in this circle there is no annual adjustment of the soil-rates to the cultivated area.\n\nFrom the remarks just quoted, it will be readily conceived that proprietary rights were somewhat ill-defined at the regular settlement; and that innumerable claims were set up, based upon the tradition of ancestral rights, but unsupported by recent possession. The manner in which these were dealt with is thus described by Captain Davies:\n\n\"The causes already described had combined to produce the state of things described, and the status, as found to have existed for a long period, was accepted as the basis of our future operations both in our judicial decisions, and in the preparation of the record-of-rights and liabilities. Pedigree tables had been drawn out in the first instance; but it was found that although the genealogies of the village communities were well known, and there were often tarfs and pattis, or as they are called varhis, yet these had not been acted on for several generations. Possession in no way corresponded with shares, and the lands of proprietors of one nominal division were often found mixed up with those of another. The State dues during the Sikh times were taken in kind by kankut or batai; while items of common income, such as dharat, kamiana, and in the Thal, pivi, were appropriated by the headmen on the pretence of defraying village expenses. Since annexation the revenue has for the most part been paid on holdings by a bigha rate, or by a distribution on ploughs, &c.\n\n\"From the foregoing description of the conditions, under which proprietorship had existed for a period long anterior to the supervision of British rule, it will be understood that possession was the fact mainly relied on in the decision of disputes connected with the title to land. Suits of this kind may be reduced to three classes:\n\nI.\u2014That in which parties out of possession sued those in possession for whole villages or for particular plots of land.\n\nII.\u2014That in which parties in possession of a certain portion of land sued a descendant of the common ancestor, in possession of a larger share, to obtain re-allotment in accordance with ancestral shares.\n\nIII.\u2014Claims by collaterals against widows, daughters or sons-in-law of a deceased sharer, either to obtain possession of the inheritance or to restrain the parties in possession from alienating the same.\n\n\"The classification might be extended further, but the above divisions comprehend the great mass of litigation; and a sufficient general idea will be conveyed of the latter by following this arrangement, and describing the arguments ordinarily put forward on both sides.\n\n\"Very strenuous efforts were made to recover possession of land of which the original proprietors had lost possession through accident, calamity, or as the result of their own improvidence, and fearful perjury was resorted to to obtain this end. Where the dispossession was beyond the period of limitation, it was generally alleged that the land claimed had been either mortgaged or lent...\"\nto the party in possession, but ordinarily no deed was forthcoming, and as in the majority of the cases this was only a device to obtain hearing for a very antiquated claim, and the defendant had admitted long possession on his side, the suit failed in its object. In other cases, the party in possession, mistrustful of the validity of his prescriptive title, would foolishly seek to strengthen it by the production of a fictitious deed of sale; of course if he failed in establishing the genuineness of the deeds the plea was fatal, but I fear, that, in many instances, forged documents succeeded in passing for genuine ones, so carelessly were legal instruments of all kinds drawn up in former days. As often however, as good grounds for believing that perjury or forgery had been committed existed, a prosecution was instituted. In this way numbers paid the penalty of attempting to mislead the courts, and I have reason to know that these proceedings were attended with the best results.\n\n\"The second class of cases were, as a rule, very simple, as enquiry everywhere showed, that, as far as the memory of living men carried them back, possession had been unequal, and had constituted the sole criterion for regulating each man's rights and liabilities. With few exceptions therefore, claims to obtain re-allotment of land in accordance with ancestral shares were rejected. The exceptions were chiefly where land had been held undivided by the different members of one family, each having cultivated in accordance with his means and ability.\n\n\"The third description of cases were more embarrassing, because, while throughout the district, and more particularly among the Awans, the feeling against landed property passing through females is very strong, the dictates of natural justice discline from passing orders the effect of which will be suddenly to deprive a man of land which he has cultivated for many years and has learned to look upon as his own. The voice of the country, however, was too strong to be directly opposed, and it was only by means of arbitration that, on the death of the widow, any portion of her deceased husband's inheritance could be reserved to her son-in-law. Attempts by the widow during her lifetime to effect the same object by means of a formal gift or fictitious sale of the property to the son-in-law were invariably disallowed as opposed to local custom.\"\n\nThe decisions given at regular settlement still form the basis of the system of proprietary right throughout the district, but there has been a great development towards further separation of rights and sub-division of the land. The total number of proprietors which at regular settlement was 33,641 was 87,943 in 1914, an increase of 161 per cent.; and the number of separate proprietary holdings which was at regular settlement 29,813 had increased in 1914 to 75,997\u2014this great increase being chiefly due to partition and alienation. During the three years ending 1914, areas aggregating 218,196 acres were divided between the individual owners. This rapid separation of rights in the land is a marked feature in the progress of the district. It is, generally speaking, a great advantage, as an owner put in separate possession of his share of the land is likely to develop it much faster and cultivate it much better than he did when other\nshareholders might claim the portion of the joint holding in his possession. Compared with the advantages, the drawbacks are insignificant, but sometimes a passion for independent possession leads individuals to demand the partition of lands which are more useful when kept joint, for instance the steep hill-sides of the Salt Range, which lose much of their value to the community, if the cattle cannot wander over them at will. Another defect is to be noticed in the bed of the Jhelum; here too meticulous an insistence on distributive justice has led to the division of the islands into long narrow strips which can hardly be cultivated at all. At present partition is proceeding apace in Khush\u00e1b Tahs\u00edl; the whole of that tract in the Moh\u00e1r Circle which lies between the Railway line and the Thal Circle has been or is being dealt with, and it is almost certain that, as soon as the preliminary questions of right have been cleared up, the bulk of the Thal waste will have to be divided up.\n\nIn the Thal up to 1907, owing to the small value of the land a peculiar custom used to exist by which in most estates all residents, whatever their position or antecedents, were recorded as owners of the land they happened to cultivate. At Mr. Wilson's revision in those estates by common consent of the whole body of proprietors all residents cultivating land or paying grazing dues on cattle were admitted to be proprietors in the estate on almost equal terms with those who were entered as proprietors at regular settlement. In many of the B\u00e1r estates a similar rule seems to have existed at regular settlement, and almost every cultivator, whatever his caste or position, was then entered as owning the land he cultivated, now but in that circle rights in land had by 1890 become so valuable that the former owners nowhere agreed to admit new comers to an equality, and in that circle, as elsewhere throughout the district, only those men were recorded as owners who derived a title in the ordinary way from the owners of regular settlement.\n\nEven in the Thal the old custom became impracticable, so soon as the possibilities of gram cultivation became generally known. It was obviously absurd that land capable of producing anything up to 20 maunds of gram to the acre should be acquired in full proprietary right by all and sundry in return for the trifling labour of driving a plough through the light soil and scattering seed. Consequently a wise Deputy Commissioner, Mr. C. H. Atkins, issued executive orders to the effect that in future those who cultivated in the common waste should be recorded as \"co-sharers in possession\" (if they already were shareholders in the common), or as tenants-at-will (if they were not). Thence for-\nward the only method by which common land could be transferred to the holdings of individuals was by partition. Unfortunately it is by no means clear from the records exactly who are entitled to a share when partition takes place, and what the measure of right is to be. The commonest entry is to the effect that the shareholders are those who paid revenue on land and cattle, according to the share of revenue paid. But as the shares of revenue paid have fluctuated year by year, according to the extent of cultivation and the number of cattle, it is obviously very necessary to decide the year for which the revenue shares are to be reckoned. But various villages have various entries, and before partition can take place it has to be decided what is to be the measure of right for each village. Two leading cases were recently decided by a court of first instance, from which these principles emerged \"unless the record of 2nd Regular Settlement gave some clear indication to the contrary, the measure of right must be held to be the revenue payable, either on land, or on cattle, or on both, according to the Record-of-Rights of 1st Regular Settlement.\" It is however possible that the findings in those two cases (Dravi and Adhi Kot) may be reversed on appeal, so the question of rights in the Thal waste has yet to be finally answered.\n\nIn all estates including common-lands, it has been noted whether persons who have acquired land by sale, gift, or exchange, are also entitled to the share in the common corresponding to the extent of their acquired ownership. In any holding in which an owner is not entitled to the corresponding share of common-land that owner is known as a \"m\u00e1lik qabza.\" So far as possible, the Revenue Record has been made to show in all such holdings who is entitled to the share in the common-land.\n\nOut of a total area of 436,273 acres of Crown land allotted in the Colony up to the end of 1915 only 6,568 acres were given to individuals in proprietary right; these grants were made either by auction sales or by way of compensation for old proprietary land taken up by Government for roads, canal, etc.: 473 acres are under towns. It is therefore clear that no proprietary rights of any great importance have been created.\n\nThere are only two estates in the district in which the land revenue has been compounded for by the owners. The whole of Ah\u00edrpur (an unirrigated village near Khush\u00e1b), and 3,000 odd acres of Jah\u00e1n\u00e1b\u00e1d are owned in this way free of land-revenue for ever.\nIn a few villages in Bhera and several in Khush\u00e1b, taalluqd\u00e1ri or ala malkiyat rights exist. In the former tahsil the taalluqd\u00e1rs are generally residents of a parent village, or else the owners of land on which a mupfid\u00e1r has been allowed to sink a well. In Khush\u00e1b the persons who were m\u00e1lik\u00e1n qabza at Regular Settlement were often recorded as paying a taalluqd\u00e1ri due to the full owners; this due is further described under Chapter III, Section A.\n\nIn 1897, Mr. Wilson wrote as follows with regard to boundaries in the bed of the Jhelum:\n\n\"On the river Jhelum the boundaries of estates and holdings once fixed are not altered by the action of the river, but at the recent revision of settlement, owing chiefly to the inaccuracy and incompleteness of the previous maps, a dispute was found going on as to boundary between almost every pair of estates on opposite sides of the river. Complete and accurate maps were made including the actual bed of the stream, and all boundaries were authoritatively laid down in accordance with previous decisions. Now that the boundary fixed can be laid down with ease and accuracy from the maps now drawn to scale, it is probable that these frequent and troublesome disputes will become a thing of the past.\"\n\nIt was found, however, when new maps had to be prepared in 1912, that there were still many instances in which the maps of adjoining estates either overlapped, or left gaps of apparently unmapped territory, and several strips of land or water were claimed by two villages. All those defects and disputes were dealt with in the following manner: the Riverain Detachment of the Survey of India traversed the whole river bed, and laid down a series of pillars on both banks, according to a single system of squares for the whole tract: a large number of survey stations were also fixed on the ground, and the patw\u00e1ris were supplied with mapping sheets, ruled in squares of the general system and with the stations exactly plotted. On these sheets the patw\u00e1ris made their field maps, and as all villages had their squares based on one pair of co-ordinates any discrepancy in the boundary became at once apparent, and was eliminated. A single map has also been compiled on a small scale, showing the village boundaries in the river-bed continuously. If in future there is any boundary dispute, all that will be necessary will be to reconstruct a portion of the square system by linking up the base line stones on either bank, and then laying out the boundary according to the map of either village.\n\nOn the Chenab, the rule of fluctuating boundaries prevailed up to 1907, in which year permanent boundaries were laid down. Probably it will be found advisable, when next the Chenab Circle\ncomes under settlement, to employ the services of the Riverain Detachment.\n\nThe rights of irrigation from each well\u2014used for that purpose have been stated in detail in the statement of rights in wells attached to the jamabandi of the standing record. Regarding rights of irrigation from inundation canals, both State and private, a separate map and file were drawn up and attested by Mr. Wilson for each canal (except the new Sahiw\u00e1l Canal then in process of development), but this was not made part of the standing record of the villages concerned. On Government canals no definite rights in water are acknowledged. A very important class of rights of irrigation is found in the villages in the Salt Range and along its base, where the cultivation is almost entirely dependent on the drainage from the higher ground or on the torrents from the hills above, and rights in the water are much more important and valuable than rights in the land. At regular settlement Captain Davies carefully recorded these rights, and at the subsequent revisions also special attention was paid to the correct record of all rights in torrents or in drainage water in this part of the district. In the case of most of the well-defined torrents the water is divided in accordance with traditional shares by erecting long embankments of stone and earth in the bed of the torrent soon after it debouches from the hills so as to divert the proper share of the whole water of the torrent towards the fields of those entitled to a share. Those fields are sometimes situated miles away from the point where the torrent is first divided, and on the way to them the water is divided into smaller and still smaller shares, until in many cases the share in the total volume of the torrent falling to a particular owner is only a very small fraction, and yet is necessary for the irrigation of his field far out in the plain. These rights are of the utmost importance, and have been very carefully attested and recorded in the administration paper of each village and also in the list of holdings (jamabandi). They are often the cause of feuds and riots, and any attempt to infringe them should be severely punished under the Penal Code. In the case of the smaller torrents generally and of drainage water flowing downwards in no well-defined channel, the usual custom is that the owner of the higher field can turn the whole of the water on to his field, and only when he has had enough or his embankment is breached by the accumulation of the water, is his neighbour lower down entitled to irrigation; and so from terrace to terrace the water passes down the slope until it has all been absorbed. In these cases also the right of each field to water has been carefully recorded in the list of holdings.\nThe method of attestation adopted in the recent revision was as follows:\u2014A list of all fields, which were previously recorded as entitled to water or which were found to be actually obtaining water, was prepared for each village; in this the previous entries for each field were inserted, and explained with the aid of a coloured map to the cultivators. Wherever a change in the old entries was admitted or proved to be necessary, the necessary correction was made and attested either by the Tahsil-dar or by the Collector. Wherever there was a conflict between present practice and apparent right, the fact that this conflict existed was noted. In all cases of dispute, the Collector himself determined what the entry should be. The results of this attestation were then incorporated in the village administration paper and in the list of holdings; and the field-lists and maps were filed in the District Revenue Record-room.\n\nTable 38 shows the number of tenancy holdings and the gross area held under each of the main forms of tenancy, as they stood in various years since settlement. But the figures for 1906 and onwards are somewhat vague; for though technically the grantees in the Colony are either occupancy tenants or tenants-at-will, they are for purposes of this table included among the self-cultivating owners. The general position may be described as follows:\u2014In Khush\u00e1b Tahsil generally, in the well-lands of the riverain and in the squares held by peasant colonists, the cultivation is mostly in the hands of the proprietary or colonist body; a large proportion of the tenant cultivation recorded is done either by mortgageors holding under mortgagees or by neighbouring owners. On the large estates irrigated by inundation canals and on the squares of nazr\u00e1na-paying colonists, the cultivation is mainly done by real tenants, i.e., by men who have no land of their own in the estate.\n\nFor the district, as a whole, it appears that 39 per cent. of the cultivation is done by the owners or grantees themselves, 23 per cent. by occupancy tenants, 58 per cent. by tenants-at-will, and 7 per cent. by squatters, etc.\n\nThe following extracts from the settlement report will show how tenant right was treated at regular settlement:\n\n\"The term 'hereditary cultivators' was not understood in the district of Shahpur for several years after the annexation of the Punjab; but enquiries showed that there were, in the river valleys at any rate, persons who, though they had no claim to proprietary title, asserted a claim to cultivate the land in their possession, subject to the payment of a rent more favourable than was demanded from the mere tenant-at-will. These men had acquired their rights by one of two ways. They had either broken up the waste land,\n(generally land on the banks of the river) and were called ab\u0101dk\u0101r\u0101n or banjarshig\u0101f\u0101n, or they had sunk a well on the land which they cultivated or had cleared out and put into working order an old well, situated in the land they tilled.\n\n\"In either case, it was the custom to allow tenants of the above description a certain amount of indulgence, compared with ordinary tenants, in taking their rents by bat\u0101i or kank\u016bt. If the prevalent rate for bat\u0101i was equal division between landlord and tenant, then the ab\u0101dk\u0101r or banjarshig\u0101f was allowed to deduct out of the crop a certain portion, varying from one-quarter to one-half of it. In dealing with cases of this description, the Settlement Officer records that he first enquired whether the cultivator asserted any proprietary claim. As a rule, such a claim was rarely raised. Among Muhammadans the idea of hereditary property is very strong, and a man whose family has been one hundred years out of possession is still popularly recognised as the owner of what once belonged to his ancestors. Generally speaking, then, the cultivator at once answered that he was not the owner, but that such a person was. The privileges which either party possessed were then enquired into, and it was generally found that the cultivator, after paying his share of the revenue, enjoyed whatever profit was left on his cultivation, giving only five per cent. on his quota of the Government demand ordinarily in grain or kind to the nominal proprietor; but the cultivator was not allowed to transfer his rights by sale or gift or mortgage.\n\n\"The circumstances which produced this condition of affairs had next to be considered, and if it turned out that the cultivator had been enjoying favourable terms for such a length of time as to render it a matter of moral certainty that he must have reimbursed himself both the principal and the interest of his original outlay of capital or labor, then it was settled that for the future he required nothing beyond a recognition of his right to occupy the land he held, subject to a fixed money payment, which in such cases was assessed at an increase of from 85 to 40 per cent., including extra cesses, on the revenue demand of the land. Excluding cesses, 25 per cent. was the highest rate of m\u0101lik\u0101na paid by any tenant. In those instances where it was found that the expenditure incurred by the cultivator had not been made good to him, a certain number of years, varying with the circumstances of each case, was fixed, during which he was to pay at certain favourable rates, and after the lapse of the period so fixed, his rent was to be brought up to the standard of similarly circumstanced cultivators. But it was only in the bela or sail\u0101b land that an arrangement of the above nature could be made. Where the land was dependent for its irrigation on a well, other circumstances had to be taken into account, not only the original outlay, but the annual expenditure for wear and tear of the well and of its machinery. And as it is generally a very unsatisfactory arrangement to allow the landlord to undertake the repairs of the well, the cultivator always had the option given him of doing so; and, if he consented, then he was allowed to pay at revenue rates with an increase of from 12 to 18 per cent. which increase went to the proprietor as hak-m\u0101lik\u0101na. The difference between the 12 or 18 per cent. and the 50 per cent. of profits remained with the cultivator to enable him to make necessary repairs; the proportion of the profits thus made over to the cultivator, varying of course with the nature of the repairs which he would probably be called on to execute. If the cultivator refused to undertake the execution of his own repairs, he received but a small share of the\nprofits, the bulk going to the landlord, who was in future to be responsible for keeping the well in fair working order.\n\n\"Out of 1,132 hereditary occupants of well lands, 564, or about half, kept the well in repair themselves, the proprietors being responsible for the repair of the wells irrigating the lands held by the remaining 568 cultivators\n\nOf the former\u2014 In the latter case\u2014\n\n| 215 pay from 5 to 10 per cent. | 91 pay from 5 to 10 per cent. |\n| 241 \" 12 to 18 \" | 88 \" 12 to 13 \" |\n| 14 \" 20 to 25 \" | 21 \" 20 to 25 \" |\n| 90 \" a lump sum in cash. | 71 \" a lump sum in cash. |\n| 4 \" varying rates in kind. | 297 \" varying rates in kind. |\n\n\"In addition to the above there were a few who, with the consent of the proprietors, were excused all payment on account of m\u0101lik\u0101na.\n\n\"These remarks do not apply to the K\u0101low\u00e1l Tahs\u012bl or the Zail M\u016bsa received by transfer from Gujrat. In those parts of the district, the heavy assessments of the Sikh times had quite trampled out proprietary rights, and artizans, and village servants, and proprietors, all paid the Government revenue by an equal rate levied, generally speaking, on the number of ploughs employed by each man. In those parts of the district cultivators of long standing were recorded as owners of the land in their occupancy and they paid their revenue at the village revenue rates. They had of course no proprietary title in any of the village lands, except what was in their actual possession as cultivators.\n\n\"In the Salt Range and the Thal tenant rights were of comparatively small importance; for the number of non-proprietary occupants of land here is very inferior to the number in the other portions of the district. The hills and the Moh\u0101r are the only tracts where cultivation is carried on to any large extent, and these divisions are held by brotherhoods of cultivating proprietors of the Aw\u0101n tribe, with few outsiders among them. The only exceptions are where whole villages belong to saintly characters, of which there are three in the Salt Range, and in the Moh\u0101r the villages owned by the Janjuha tribe. In the former almost the entire cultivation is in the hands of non-proprietors, the proprietors taking their rents by b\u0101t\u012b at easy rates, usually a third of the produce. In the latter, the Janjuha proprietors, through apathy and indifference, have allowed not only rights of occupancy to grow up, but have given opportunity to men of other tribes to creep in and supplant them in the proprietorship of a greater part of the lands still left to them by the Aw\u0101ns. Of course these last are proprietors of their own holdings only, and have no share in the common land or common profits.\n\nAt Mr. Wilson's revision of settlement the rights of tenants with rights of occupancy were carefully defined and recorded, but no attempt was made to classify them under the different clauses of the Tenancy Act. Only 16,526 acres in 4,315 holdings were then held with rights of occupancy. In the great majority of cases such tenants either paid rent in kind (3,588 acres) or in terms of the revenue rate with or without m\u0101lik\u0101na (12,351 acres), and except in the few cases in which a regular suit for enhancement was brought, no change was made in the\nrent except that in the latter case the tenant was made responsible for the new revenue due on his land with m\u00e1lik\u00e1na on it at the old percentage. As in most cases the revenue due and with it the m\u00e1lik\u00e1na receivable by the landlord were substantially enhanced, suits for enhancement of the m\u00e1lik\u00e1na percentage were not numerous.\n\nExcept for cases in which by the failure of heirs or purchase by the owners occupancy rights have ceased to exist, there has in the proprietary villages been little change since second settlement. Mention must, however, be made of an important extension introduced by the conditions of colony grants. All 'peasant' colonists are entitled at the end of five years to receive rights of occupancy, provided they have observed the conditions of the grant: in the case of horse-breeding peasants no charge is made; other peasants have to pay two instalments of Rs. 2 per acre before they are recorded as occupancy tenants. Probably in course of time a considerable proportion of the 264,599 acres held by men of these classes will carry rights of occupancy; and up to 1915 more than 257,644 acres had actually done so. Nazr\u00e1n\u00e1-paying colonists obtained occupancy rights on entry: in the case of horse-breeders there was a sliding scale of nazr\u00e1n\u00e1 from Rs. 6 per acre for 4 squares up to Rs. 22 per acre for 20 squares: where there were no horse-breeding conditions, the rates were trebled. Occupancy rights in 71,490 acres have been acquired on these terms. In a somewhat similar way Government in 1896 granted occupancy rights to a number of small farmers who had been cultivating State lands on lease for a number of years.\n\nAlthough a number of colonists are already occupancy tenants and others have every expectation of obtaining that status, we may well consider the \"colonists\" as a distinct body of men, formed of various classes.\n\nThe areas held by each class are shown in the margin. The most important are the horse-breeders, who are bound to keep up in good condition a branded mare for every unit of grant, and to give the Army Remount Department the first refusal of the progeny. A more detailed account of the scheme will be found in Chapter II-A.\n\n| Class of Colonist | Acres allotted |\n|-------------------|---------------|\n| I.\u2014Horse-breeders\u2014|               |\n| (a) Peasant       |               |\n| (i) Cavalry      | 28,933        |\n| (ii) Others      | 165,770       |\n| (b) Nazr\u00e1n\u00e1-paying\u2014|               |\n| (i) Stud-farms   | 6,754         |\n| (ii) Cavalry     | 6,925         |\n| (iii) Others     | 15,854        |\n| II.\u2014Arboriculturists\u2014|             |\n| (a) Nurserymen   | 2,183         |\n| (b) Planters     | 1,252         |\n| III.\u2014Other colonists\u2014|            |\n| (a) Peasants     | 69,896        |\n| (b) Nazr\u00e1n\u00e1-paying| 42,457        |\nThe difference between the peasants (ghor\u00edp\u00e1l ab\u00e1dk\u00e1r) and the nasr\u00e1na-payers (ghor\u00edp\u00e1l sufed-posh) is that the former each keep up only one mare, with a two squares (55 acres) unit of grant, on which they must reside, while the latter keep up two or more mares with a $1\\frac{1}{2}$ squares unit, and may reside elsewhere. There are six stud-farms, kept up by Capt. the Hon'ble Malik Sir Umar Hay\u00e1t Kh\u00e1n, Naw\u00e1b Hab\u00edb Ullah Kh\u00e1n, Naw\u00e1b Khuda Bakhsh Kh\u00e1n R\u00e1ja Painda Kh\u00e1n, Agha Woosat Ali Kh\u00e1n, and Malik Muzaffar Kh\u00e1n. In all horse-breeding grants, succession is according to the rules of primogeniture. The arboricultural colonists hold their lands on a 20 years' lease, subject to resumption in the event of previous death or breach of conditions. A nurseryman (zakh\u00edrad\u00e1r) ordinarily receives 10 killas (rather more than 11 acres), 3 of which have to be set aside and maintained as a nursery for young trees. A tree-planter (darakhip\u00e1l) ordinarily receives one square, and is bound to plant with shisham or k\u00edkar trees not less than two miles of roadside avenue, and to maintain the avenue in proper condition. The other colonists have no special conditions of service, having received their grants by way of reward or compensation, and are not subject to the rule of primogeniture, except in the case of grants of 4 squares and over. On the other hand, if a peasant of this class dies before he has acquired a right of occupancy, all his rights in the tenancy are extinguished. The difference between the peasants (ab\u00e1dk\u00e1rs) and the nasr\u00e1na-payers (sufed-posh ab\u00e1dk\u00e1r) is that the unit of grant is for the former one* square and for the latter two or more squares, and whereas the latter obtained occupancy rights on entry, the latter only became entitled if still surviving after five years from the commencement of the tenancy.\n\nThese two classes may be cross-divided according to origin as shown in the margin.\n\n| Class of grantee | Acres allotted |\n|------------------|---------------|\n| Infantry grantees | 29,287        |\n| Civil grantees   | 23,250        |\n| J\u00e1ngl\u00eds          | 59,816        |\n\nMuhammadans and Path\u00e1ns. The Civil grantees are a miscellaneous collection, largely non-agriculturists and non-residential. The J\u00e1ngl\u00eds are the old denizens of the B\u00e1r, very cunning with camels and cattle, but no farmers. The Cavalry horse breeders are principally Sikhs from the Central Punjab; the other horse-breeders are mostly Aw\u00e1ns, Tiw\u00e1ns, Mairs, etc., from Shahpur and Jhelum, or Muhammadan or Sikh Jats from Gujr\u00e1t, Gujr\u00e1n-w\u00e1la and Si\u00e1lkot. Most of the colonists, with the exception of\n\n*In cases of compensation, it may be less.\nthe Si\u00e1lkot\u00eds and Mid-Punjab Jats are comparatively poor cultivators and easy going, while the fact that the horse-breeders are insured by primogeniture against over-crowding deprives them of one great incentive to industry.\n\nIn addition to the occupancy tenants and Lower Jhelum colonists, there are a certain number of other persons holding land under Government. These are (a) holders of land on long leases under the rules of 1897, (b) holders of land on annual leases, (c) a lessee who accepted a grant in Maddat\u00e1b\u00e1d, south of Shahpur, in exchange for land which he had to abandon in the Civil Station at Sargodha. The district board is allowed to manage the Government lands along the Bhera-S\u00e1h\u00edw\u00e1l high road, known as Chak Patri, and in the Shahpur Civil Station Regimental stud farms occupy 8,164 acres in the Colony, and the seed-farm at Sargodha 170 acres. A few cases were found in which old canal beds, technically the property of Government, had been brought under cultivation. In these cases the persons in possession were evicted, if the canal bed was required as a drainage-channel; otherwise the ownership of the land was given up to them. A big block of land in Rakhs Khabakki and Shin-Dhakki is now being disforested and leased to the villagers of Khabakki, Khutakka and J\u00e1ba in exchange for some grazing rights which they have conceded to the Camel Corps. In other Government lands the orders are that no new leases, annual or otherwise, are to be given out at present.\n\nThe areas held by tenants-at-will in 1912 are shown in the margin. The tenants who pay in terms of the land revenue (as a rule without m\u00e1l\u00edk\u00e1na), are for the most part neighbours cultivating for an owner or squatters in the Thal or in the common lands of the village. In the old days when land had little value, and the proprietary body were glad of any assistance in meeting the revenue-demand, such squatters were often encouraged: now that all land has a very appreciable value the owners would often like to evict them, but find it very difficult to take concerted action. As partitions are carried out, these men will either be evicted or will succeed in proving adverse possession, and so will acquire the status of owners.\n\nThe rents paid by ordinary tenants-at-will in cash and in kind have already been fully discussed in Chapter II, Section B. These tenants have no greater security of tenure than that afforded them by the Tenancy Act.\nIn the colony Chaks 10,858 acres have been set aside as Kamins' squares; this means that in each village a few squares have been put at the disposal of the community who give 3 or 5 killas for cultivation to various village-servants and menials in payment for their services. In the old estates a small area of common land is sometimes given up to the 'Parish Priest' or some other servant of the public in much the same way.\n\nPrevious to the establishment of the Lahore residency, that portion of the Jach Do\u00e1b in which the eastern half of the Shahpur District is situated used to be farmed out by the Sikh Darb\u00e1r to different kard\u00e1rs of more or less note. Gul\u00e1b Singh, subsequently the Mahar\u00e1ja of Kashmir, for some years held the lease of Bhera. Kharak Singh, afterwards for a short time Mahar\u00e1ja of the Punjab, used to have the direct charge of the S\u00e1h\u00edw\u00e1l Tahs\u00edl, and Diw\u00e1n S\u00e1wan Mal of Mult\u00e1n sometimes took the farm of the K\u00e1low\u00e1l Tahs\u00edl. These magnates were succeeded in the years immediately preceding the Sutlej campaign by men of less note, who had smaller tracts of country entrusted to them. But both they and their predecessors, as rule, collected their rent by bat\u00e1i (division of the harvest when reaped and threshed), or by kank\u00fat (appraisement of the standing crops) or by under-leasing a few villages, here and there, for a certain cash payment to some person possessing a little local importance, who again made his own arrangements for collecting his rents according to one of the above described modes. As the principal lessee held his lease subject to renewal annually, of course any contracts entered into by him were only for a similar period.\n\nThe result of these arrangements was that the officers who first attempted to introduce the system by which the collection of the revenue was made in cash had very little reliable data to guide them. It is true that the archives of the Darb\u00e1r could furnish them with the gross amount which used to be received into the Sikh treasury during a certain year for a certain tract of country; and so, again, the accounts rendered annually by the subordinate contractors seemed to show in detail the proportions in which the payments were to be credited to each village. But these accounts purported to show payments on account of revenue, and were no clue to the gross rental of each village; and it appeared from inquiry that the rent of the village was taken either by bat\u00e1i or kank\u00fat, the rate by which individuals paid varying in the same village from 50 to 25 per cent. of the gross outturn.\n\nThe grain thus collected was often made over by the sub-lessee, who had agreed to pay so much for the year's revenue of a\nvillage, to the k\u00e1rd\u00e1r at something under its market value. The k\u00e1rd\u00e1r again often received credit in the Darb\u00e1r treasury for the payment in cash of a certain sum on account of one or more villages by complying with an order to pay certain troops, stationed in the neighbourhood, their arrears of pay for a certain number of months. As these troops had been living on credit, the k\u00e1rd\u00e1r settled with them by giving so much in grain to the bany\u00e1s to whom the troops were indebted for food and so much to the troops in cash. Seeing that the value of grain is continually fluctuating, it is obvious that when the payments made in that commodity travelled round so large a circle, the figures, which in the Sikh record exhibited the revenue of a village in money, were not of much assistance to the officer who had eventually to assess the revenue.\n\nIn the Sikh times the B\u00e1r jungle villages paid a lump assessment which was composed of a land tax, cattle tax and house tax. The inhabitants used also to pay another cess called faroi. The amount of this tax was very variable, and indeed its collection was accompanied with trouble. It was supposed to represent 25 per cent. of the value of the property annually stolen by the inhabitants of any particular village. However, this was an irregular source of income for the k\u00e1rd\u00e1r and was not included in the official accounts; consequently it formed no part of the data on which the assessments of the summary and regular settlements were fixed.\n\nHowever, when the Residency was first established, no better data than these accounts of the Sikh Darb\u00e1r were procurable; and, as it was absolutely necessary that the land revenue demand should be fixed for the current year, English officers were deputed all over the country to assess the revenue of each village separately. The Government demand was to be fixed in cash, and each village was invited to enter into an engagement for a period of three years. The assessments were to be based on the Sikh returns, on which a reduction of 20 per cent. was to be allowed. Of course if particular circumstances seemed to require a large reduction, the English officers had the power to afford it. The term of this settlement expired in the Shahpur District with the Sikh year Sambat 1907, corresponding with A.D. 1850 Mr. Lewis Bowring, an officer who produced a very favourable impression on the people of Shahpur, and whose name was constantly in their mouths for years after his connection with the district ceased, fixed the assessments of the Bhera and Sah\u00edw\u00e1l portions of the district. The\nK\u00e1low\u00e1l portion was assessed by Mr. Cocks, who, owing to press of work, had to fix his assessments at Lahore.\n\nThe Government demand was paid in full for Sambats 1904 and 1905 (A.D. 1848 and 1849). The collections were still made from individuals in kind, but they were paid during the former year into the Sikh, and during the latter year into the English treasury in cash. In 1859 a few balances accrued, but still, owing to the high price of grain, and to other causes which have been fully explained in other settlement reports bearing on the same period, the zamind\u00e1rs were able to pay the greater part of the Government demand during that year, and also during the succeeding year. But towards the close of 1851, a great cry of distress arose throughout the district, and as the period of the settlement made in Sumbat 1904 had expired with the year Samlat 1907 (A.D. 1850) it was considered absolutely necessary that a revision of the demand should be at once effected.\n\nAs Major Birch, the Deputy Commissioner at the time, had no assistant, and the necessity was pressing, Mr. E. Thornton, the Commissioner, determined to revise the demand for the K\u00e1low\u00e1l Tahs\u00edl where the distress was the greatest. He accordingly, in the course of his tour, went to the village of M\u00e1ngni in that tahs\u00edl, and reduced the Government demand from one lakh to 75,000 rupees. This assessment was commenced and finished in three days, and was, humanly speaking, the means of speedily restoring an almost ruined and deserted tract of country to a flourishing condition.\n\nEarly in 1852, Mr. Ouseley was ordered to revise the Government demand in the Sah\u00edw\u00e1l and Bhera Tahs\u00edls. His instructions were to make the settlement for the years 1851-52, or until such time when the regular settlement demand should be determined; that as the year 1851 had expired, any increase in the Government demand was to be collected from 1852 only, whereas any remission that was considered necessary was to have retrospective effect. The Government demand throughout the district was by these operations reduced from Rs. 3,42,492 to Rs. 2,67,455; this demand was collected without difficulty until the regular settlement assessment was determined, and when that assessment was determined, it was found that so far from a reduction on the summary settlement demand being necessary, an increase on it could be taken.\nThe results of the three summary settlements are shown in the following table:\n\n| No. | Tahsil | Joms of 1st summary settlement | Joms of 2nd summary settlement | Joms of 3rd summary settlement | Decrease | Remarks |\n|-----|--------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|----------|---------|\n|     |        | Rs.                           | Rs.                           | Rs.                           | Rs.      |         |\n| 1   | Bhara  | 1,25,164                      | 1,14,941                      | 1,07,579                      | 17,585   | The revenue of the Khawab and Fardha talukas transferred to Shahpur from the districts of Latah and Jhang in the years 1853 and 1854 and added to the Sihwal Taluk have been excluded, so as not to disturb the comparison. |\n| 2   | Sihwal | 1,18,350                      | 99,945                        | 96,199                        | 22,313   |         |\n| 3   | Kalowal| 93,028                        | 75,617                        | 63,738                        | 35,240   |         |\n| Total|        | 3,42,402                      | 2,90,503                      | 2,07,455                      | 75,037   |         |\n\nThe Mitha Tiwana, Nurpur and Sun talukas, as before explained, formed part of the jagir of Hari Singh, Nalwa. After the death of this leader, the two former were transferred in farm to Malik Fateh Khan, Tiwana, and were held by him, with but few interruptions, till his death in 1848. At the same time, the Sun taluka was for a year or two given in farm to Raja Gulab Singh, who at this time held the contract for the greater part of the district, and afterwards transferred in jagir to Sardar Gurmukh Singh, Lamba. The Khabakki and Katha talukas were for many years the jagir of Hari Singh, Mazbi, from whom they passed to Maharaja Kharak Singh, the former in 1822 and the latter in 1825. On Kharak Singh's elevation to the throne they were given to Sardar Shamsher Singh, Sindhwanwalia, as part of his jagir, and so remained till annexation. The talukas of Ahmadabad and Nurpur Sethi went through many hands; among others, Raja Gulab Singh held the contract of the former for ten years from 1833 to 1843, and from 1844 to 1846 it formed part of Raja Hira Singh's jagir, while the latter for nineteen years, viz., from 1818 to 1837, constituted the jagir of Sardar Ram Singh, Billi, a native of Bhagpur in the Manjha.\n\nThe management in all cases was identical; the jagirdars being foreigners seldom resided on the spot, hence everything was left to the resident manager or kardar, and as his tenure of office was often very precarious, he generally extorted as much from the zamindars as he could. The collections were made by that most iniquitous of systems, appraisement of the standing crop, or tip as it used to be called, by which the heaviest share of the common burden was nearly always made to fall on the shoulders least fitted.\nto bear it, because, forsooth, the owners were unable to bribe the k\u00e1rd\u00e1r or his underlings into making a favourable estimate of the probable outturn of their fields, as their richer brethren did. Bat\u00e1i, a far fairer mode of collection, was only resorted to in favour of individuals whom the k\u00e1rd\u00e1r wished to humour, or in respect of lands of which some portion of the State or j\u00e1g\u00edrd\u00e1r's share of the produce had been temporarily alienated as a concession to the leading members of the agricultural community.\n\nThe first summary settlement of this trans-Jhelum tract was made by Mr. L. Bowring and, seeing what insufficient and unreliable data he had to work with, the rapidity with which the assessments had to be made, and how obviously it was the interest of the j\u00e1g\u00edrd\u00e1rs, whose income would be affected by the arrangements made, to mislead, it is rather a matter of surprise that the first settlements worked so well, than that considerable inequalities in the assessments were subsequently discovered. Other causes also combined to render revision necessary before long; and this was accordingly affected in 1852 by Major C. Browne for the tal\u00fak\u00e1s afterwards received from Jhelum; and in the following year by Mr. David Simpson for those which then formed part of the Leiah District. The result of these revisions was a considerable reduction in the assessments of the hill tal\u00fak\u00e1s, but more especially in regard to the jam\u00e1s of the villages lying along the north of the S\u00fan valley. The assessment of the Mitha tal\u00faka was also somewhat reduced, while that of N\u00farpur was raised by nearly 30 per cent.\n\nThis second summary settlement worked tolerably well; but still it was known that the assessment of the Salt Range villages was somewhat oppressive, and from time to time relief was given in the most glaring cases. This settlement was ostensibly made for two years only, but soon after this term had expired, the mutinies broke out; and before the finances of the country had recovered themselves sufficiently to allow of measures entailing extraordinary expenditure being undertaken, the Leiah District was broken up, which led to further delay, and thus it was that no steps were taken for some time to place the assessment and the rights of property on a sound basis. It must not, however, be omitted from mention that Mr. Parsons in 1860 revised the Government demand in the N\u00farpur tal\u00faka; the result was a slight reduction; but a more important change was made in allowing the proprietary body in each village to engage separately for their own revenue, instead of the plan\nwhich had been in force up to that time, by which the Tiw\u00e1na Maliks had alone been responsible for the payments of the whole tal\u00faka.\n\nIn 1854 regular settlement operations were commenced in the Shahpur District as then constituted (see Chapter II) under Mr. Richard Temple, who was presently succeeded by Mr. Gore Ouseley. By 1860 Mr. Ouseley had completed the assessment of the Bhera, K\u00e1lcw\u00e1l and S\u00e1hiw\u00e1l tahsils; he was succeeded by Captain (now Sir W. G.) Davies, who assessed the tracts received from Leiah and Jhelum and completed the whole settlement in 1866.\n\nThe following table shows figures for the results of the regular settlement cis-Jhelum, in continuation of the information contained in the tabular statement on page 273:\n\n| No. | Tahsil | Jama of summary settlement | Jama of regular settlement | Increase | Decrease | Remarks |\n|-----|--------|---------------------------|---------------------------|----------|----------|---------|\n|     |        | Rs.                       | Rs.                       | Rs.      | Rs.      |         |\n| 1   | Bhera  | 1,07,579                  | 1,04,658                  | ...      | 2,921    | Balancing these last two columns gives an increase of Rs. 3,386. The increase was caused chiefly by the formation of estates, the decrease was due to reduction of jama in existing villages. |\n| 2   | Shahpur| 96,138                    | 1,02,120                  | 5,682    |          |         |\n| 3   | K\u00e1lcw\u00e1l| 63,738                    | 64,363                    | 625      |          |         |\n| Total|        | 2,67,455                  | 2,71,141                  | 6,307    | 2,921    |         |\n\nThe general fiscal results of the revision of the assessment of the trans-Jhelum tract made by Captain Davies in 1865 will be seen from the table given in the margin. Reduction was nominal, except in the Hill Circle, where, as before explained, the summary settlement jam\u00e1s pressed very heavily in places, and the general character of the assessment in the S\u00fan valley was decidedly oppressive; on the other hand the assessment in the Thal and Danda circles was a good deal raised. At first sight it\nwould appear that there had been a considerable reduction in the *tirni* of the Thal; but in reality the tax was raised, for thirty *rakhs* containing an area of 220,000 acres had been marked off.\n\nThe figures in the margin show the general fiscal* results of the regular settlement, following the divisions of the district as finally adjusted. The punctuality with which this demand was paid is seen from the fact that in no year did the balance at the end of the financial year exceed 5 per cent. of the demand and only in two years, viz., 1868-69 and 1887-88, did it exceed 3 per cent. At the end of the agricultural year, however, i.e., in September, after the completion of the *rabi* collections, the balance was sometimes larger; thus in 1882 after a series of bad years, and again in 1887 after the failure of the *rabi* harvest, the balance in September exceeded Rs. 30,000, or say 8 per cent. of a year's demand. This was due to time being given the revenue-payers, and on the whole it may be said that during the currency of the regular settlement there were few suspensions and practically no remissions, and that the assessment was on the whole realised with ease.\n\nThe revision of the first regular settlement of the district was begun in 1887 and completed in 1894, the operations throughout being conducted by Mr. J. Wilson, the Deputy Commissioner of the district. A detailed account of the principles and procedure followed is contained in the printed assessment and settlement reports. The instructions, briefly stated, were to make the estimated value of half the net produce of each estate the maximum for the Government demand, taking as a principal guide the rents paid in money or in kind on an average of years by an ordinary tenant-at-will, care being taken not to tax unfairly the capital invested in improvements, and full allowance being made for all circumstances directly or\n\n---\n\n*Note.\u2014The real decrease after deducting the increase of Rs. 1,702 is Rs. 11,725 which falls at about 3 per cent. on the summary settlement *jama*; but this does not take into account the income from *rakh* (about Rs. 23,000), which for the first time were created during this settlement.*\n\n---\n\n*i.e., revenue paid into the treasury; assigned revenue is left out of account.*\nindirectly bearing on the profits and rents of the landowners. In order to break the suddenness of the enhancement in many villages a portion of the increase was deferred for a few years, so that the initial enhancement falls short of the final de and as announced at settlement. For the whole district the statistics were as follows:\n\n| Tahsil | Total fixed assessment in rupees including assigned revenue |\n|--------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n|        | Of regular settlement. Of last year before revision. Final revised assessment. Actual assessment of 1893-94. |\n|        | Rs. | Rs. | Rs. |\n| Bhera  | ... | 1,31,311 | 1,34,980 | 2,55,119 | 2,22,614 |\n| Shahpur| ... | 1,13,180 | 1,34,988 | 1,94,503 | 1,77,025 |\n| Khushab| ... | 1,44,956 | 1,52,315 | 1,95,242 | 1,94,413 |\n| Total  | ... | 3,89,445 | 4,31,963 | 6,44,864 | 5,94,052 |\n\nIn addition to the fixed assessment, a portion of the land-revenue on the canals was imposed in the form of a rate fluctuating with the matured area, at the rate of 8 annas per matured acre, which was called \"water-advantage rate,\" and calculated to bring in Rs. 33,200 per annum. The total demand, as sanctioned, was 74 per cent. in excess of that imposed at regular settlement; the assessment due in the first year after revision (including Rs. 33,200, water-advantage rate) was 45 per cent. more than that due in the last year before revision. Mr. Wilson was able to justify his assessments by the following considerations among others:\n\na) The pitch of the assessment at regular settlement was over Re. 1-4-0 per acre, and at second settlement was less than Re. 1-0-0,\n(b) At regular settlement the demand was equivalent to $1\\frac{1}{3}$ maunds of wheat per acre; and at second settlement to $\\frac{2}{3}$ maund only.\n\n(c) Measured in gold, the incidence was \u00a30-2-7 at regular settlement, and \u00a30-1-3 only at second settlement.\n\nThat is to say the rise in demand was considerably less than the increase in wealth due to extensions of cultivation and rise in prices, especially gold-prices. All the same, it was felt in the irrigated circles that the new assessment was very full, and in consequence the demand actually imposed was allowed to remain in defect of the final sanctioned demand to the extent shown in the margin. The ultimate result of the settlement was to absorb about one-seventh of the gross grain produce and 39 per cent. of the landowner's net profits.\n\nThe assessments were confirmed for a period of twenty years from the dates on which they were respectively introduced. They were, therefore, due to expire as follows:\n\n| Tahsil | Assessment circle | Harvest from which the re-assessment came into force | Harvest with which period of settlement was due to expire |\n|--------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| Bhera  | Chenab            | Kharif 1889                                          | Rabi 1909                                                |\n|        | B\u00e1r and Jhelum    | Rabi 1891                                            | Kharif 1910                                              |\n| Shahpur| Whole tahsil      | Kharif 1892                                          | Rabi 1912                                                |\n| Khush\u00e1b| Plains portion    | Rabi 1893                                            | Kharif 1912                                              |\n|        | Hill              | Kharif 1891                                          | Rabi 1911                                                |\n\nIt was recognised from the outset that in so insecure a district the system of collection must be thoroughly elastic, and\nsuspensions or remissions were freely given when circumstances so required. This fact, combined with the unassailable fairness of Mr. Wilson's distribution of the demand over villages, enabled the settlement to be worked without any difficulty. The details of collections will be found in Table 39; the figurers do not include Rs. 49,654 of assigned revenue.\n\nWhen perennial irrigation from the Lower Jhelum Canal was introduced into the B\u00e1r, the light b\u00e1r\u00e1ni assessments in force were clearly inadequate. The fact that the settlement still had several years to run presented no difficulty, as the villagers were only too glad to agree to its cancellation on condition that they got canal water at once. Hence in 1902 it was ordered that the Colonization Officer should apply summary fluctuating rates, not only to the newly colonized Crown lands which had not previously been assessed but also to all proprietary estates whose owners had formally agreed to the cancellation of the fixed assessment. The Summary fluctuating rates imposed were known as \"consolidated\" rates, and included land-revenue and cesses in the proportion of 4 to 1 and in the case of Crown lands, malik\u00e1na also, at a quarter of the land revenue.* These rates were as shown in the margin in the first instance, but in 1906 the abolition of the famine and patwari cesses caused a reduction of 1 anna 2\u00bd pies in the rupee. The previous fixed assessment in these circles had been Rs. 86,280, out of which Rs. 56,058 still remained, and Rs. 30,122 was cancelled, and replaced by the consolidated rates. The fluctuating assessments shown in the margin do not represent the full demand recoverable from the consolidated rates, as many estates were in 1905-06 still\n\n| Circle          | Rate per acre\u2014 |\n|-----------------|----------------|\n|                 | (a) In Crown lands |\n|                 | (b) Proprietary lands |\n|                 | Ch\u00e1hi and b\u00e1r\u00e1ni | Nahri. |\n| Bhena B\u00e1r       | Rs.

The Punjab Government however was unwilling to accept his proposals, which were based on a series of years in which the Colony had not reached its full development, and which had been particularly unfortunate in the matter of calamities of seasons. Mr. Rudkin, Assistant Colonization Officer, was ordered to collect more up-to-date statistics, and meanwhile the rates were left unaltered.\n\nMr. Rudkin submitted his report in 1911, and the new rates were introduced from Rabi 1912 for a period of 10 years. The sanctioned revenue-rates are shown below: they do not include m\u0101lik\u0101na or cesses:\n\n| Circle                  | Nahri | Jh\u0101ld\u0101ri | Ch\u0101hi | B\u0101rd\u0101ni |\n|-------------------------|-------|----------|-------|---------|\n| Bhera B\u0101r              | Rs.

In addition to this, cesses were to be paid at 13\u00bd per cent., and m\u0101lik\u0101na at the nominal rate of 2 annas per acre allotted for horse-breeding colonists and 12 or 6 annas per killa allotted for\nother tenants, according as the *nahri* revenue rate was as much as Rs. 2 per acre or less.\n\nPerennial irrigation in the Chenab Circle only extended as far as the flood embankment, and a considerable area on the south side was not included in the settlement of the Colony area. It was found however that the abandonment of wells, migration of tenants to the canal, loss of floods, and, above all, spread of alkali had so weakened the circle that the fixed assessment had become burdensome. A fluctuating system was therefore introduced in this area also by Mr. Rudkin, with effect from *kharif* 1910. The average sanctioned rates were:\n\n| Rs. A. P. |\n|-----------|\n| Ch\u00e1hi ... ... ... 1 8 0 per acre matured. |\n| S\u00e1il\u00e1b ... ... ... {1 8 0} per acre matured |\n| ... ... ... {1 0 0} according to class of crop. |\n| B\u00e1r\u00e1ni ... ... ... 1 0 0 |\n\nThese rates were raised or lowered according to the quality of the village.\n\nThroughout the remaining portions of the district, that is to say, the River Circles, the Khush\u00e1b uplands, and such scattered fragments of the B\u00e1r and Ara as had not obtained perennial irrigation, the settlement was due to expire between *kharif* 1910 and *kharif* 1912. The work of revising the assessment was begun by Mr. Leigh in October 1911, who submitted an assessment report for the *cis*-Jhelum tract in August 1913, and one for the Khush\u00e1b Tahsil in November 1914. In the *cis*-Jhelum tract, the passing of orders was delayed for two years owing to the tendency of negotiations between Government and the owners of Private Canals, with a view to replacing the inundation system by a *kharif* distributary of the Lower Jhelum Canal. These negotiations came to nothing, and the new assessments came into force from the *rabi* of 1915 in Khush\u00e1b and the *rabi* of 1916 in the *cis*-Jhelum. Definite orders as to the period of settlement have not been passed, but it is probable that a 20-year period will be sanctioned. The general effect of the re-assessment was to raise the total demand in Bhera, Shahpur (including a small corner of Sargodha), and Khush\u00e1b by 30, 28, and 32 per cent. respectively. This was accomplished mainly by doubling the water-advantage-rate on the inundation canals, and by raising the b\u00e1r\u00e1ni and banjar rates in the Thal.\nThe pitch of the revenue rates in each assessment circle according to the new and the old settlements can be judged from the following table:\n\n| Enna | Second Settlement |\n|------|-------------------|\n|....  | Rs.

In a few other villages elsewhere, some of the demand has been deferred for a time on account of the sudden increase.\n\nIt is estimated that the new demand, when fully imposed, will absorb the proportions of gross grain produce and half net-assets shown in the margin. If allowance is made for the income derived from cattle and miscellaneous products of the waste, the figures would be materially lowered. Thus in Khush\u00e1b Tahsil, if the income from cattle in the Thal and Mohar circles only be added in, the assessment will only absorb 55 per cent. of the half net-assets. It has already been shown that Mr. Wilson's assessment...\nwas designed to secure about one-seventh of the gross produce and 78 per cent. of the half net-assessments, and that he was able to prove that the pitch of the regular settlement had been considerably higher. So it is clear that, as cultivation has expanded and prices have risen, the assessments have been progressively lenient. This has been frankly admitted by the revenue-payers of Khush\u00e1b, and by all those in Bhera and Shahpur who are not mainly dependent upon the canal. The doubling of the water-advantage-rate has called forth a good deal of protest, but it is fully justified by the fact that on the canals the increase of expenses and the difficulty of finding tenants are very much less than on the well-lands, and generally speaking canal holdings are much larger, and the benefit from improved prices is proportionately greater.\n\nIt is not possible to institute any exact comparison between the total assessment of the district now and that of previous settlements, since the advent of the canal has introduced an entirely new factor; but it is worth remarking that whereas in 1863 the incidence of the revenue was over Re. 1-4-0 per acre of cultivation it is now not quite Re. 1-12-0, an increase by no means proportionate to the increase in irrigated area or the rise in prices. In Khush\u00e1b Tahsil, where the only important change has been in the methods and area of cultivation, it is possible to make a more exact comparison:\n\n| Rs.          |\n|--------------|\n| Average collections under Sikh administration | 2,00,000 |\n| Demand at expiry of Summary settlements        | 1,52,500 |\n| Demand at beginning of First Regular Settlement | 1,44,954 |\n| Demand at end of First Regular Settlement      | 1,52,315 |\n| Demand at beginning of Second Regular Settlement | 1,95,016 |\n| Demand at end of Second Regular Settlement     | 1,98,474 |\n| Demand at beginning of Third Regular Settlement | 2,40,252 |\n| Final Demand as sanctioned for Third Regular Settlement | 2,63,000 |\n\nThe revenue assigned to j\u00e1gird\u00e1rs and m\u00e1fid\u00e1rs now amounts to Rs. 40,625, out of the final sanctioned demand, as against Rs. 41,145 in 1893. These sums do not include the in\u00e1ms paid to zaild\u00e1rs and in\u00e1mkhors, which amount to Rs. 12,159. The bulk of the assignments are made in perpetuity, either to Tiw\u00e1na Maliks, Baloch Sard\u00e1rs, etc., for services rendered at the time of the Mutiny (as described in Chapter I, Section C), or to religious institutions, such as the Koh Kir\u00e1na shrine, and the Th\u00e1n of Kaya Nath in Bhera. A few villages are held in j\u00e1gir by\nTiw\u00e1na Maliks for one or more lives, and the remaining assignments are for the term of settlement in favour of lesser religious institutions.\n\nThe demand for the kharif harvest has to be paid in by January 15th, and that for the rabi harvest by July 15th in the hills and by July 1st elsewhere. An arrangement has recently been adopted whereby each village is required to pay in its revenue on a fixed date, and only as many estates are assigned to one date as can be easily dealt with by the staff. This will greatly diminish the difficulties of headmen, provided they are backed up by the Revenue authorities in their endeavours to secure prompt payment by the land-owners.\n\nIn the area under fluctuating assessment, it is never necessary to suspend the current demand; and generally speaking in the Jhelum Circles of Bhera, Shahpur and Khush\u00e1b, the fact that the water-advantage-rate fluctuates with the matured crop provides a sufficient degree of elasticity. There are however a few villages in these circles classed, for special reasons, as insecure. In the Hill circle of Khush\u00e1b the rainfall is fairly constant, and it is only in the Vanhar tract that suspensions are likely to be required occasionally. The Thal and Mohar circles, on the other hand, are as insecure as any tract could be, and it is not infrequently necessary to suspend the entire demand for the harvest. In these two circles, the pitch of the assessment is so low that it is always easy to recover the suspended sums as soon as a good harvest ensues, unless indeed the drought has been so prolonged that the resources of the peasantry are completely exhausted. A succession of bad harvests between 1898 and 1903 made it necessary to remit considerable sums for this reason.\n\nRemissions of course have to be given for unforeseen calamities such as hailstorms, boll-worm, or plague. Thus over Rs. 20,000 were remitted in the Bhera-Jhelum circle in the rabi of 1904 on account of plague, and over Rs. 10,000 in Shahpur were suspended for the same reason, and remitted the next year. In the south of the district remissions to the extent of some Rs. 18,000 were allowed on account of damage by hail in 1914-15 and liberal remissions were made in 1911-12 on the cotton crop, which suffered much from boll-worm. It is specially important that full allowance should be made for such calamities, as in the ordinary course no allowance is made for crops which are not up to standard, except when there is total failure, or where there are admitted to be defects in the water-supply.\n\nAt Second Settlement Mr. Wilson prepared a very careful and accurate record-of-rights for the whole district. The field\nmaps were prepared in the plains on the square system, and in the hills by triangulation, all the work being done by patw\u00e1ris. It was of course inevitable that in a difficult country like the Thal or the river-beds, these maps should be to some extent distorted, but on the whole the results were surprisingly good. The jama-band\u00eds and other parts of the standing record were also prepared with great care, and were admitted on all hands to be very good.\n\nWhen perennial irrigation was introduced, it was decided that all would-be irrigators must as an initial measure lay out their fields on a system of squares of 40 karams each way. These squares were called \"Killas,\" owing to the fact that their corners were marked by pegs, and 25 killas made a \"murabba\" or \"square\" of 200 karams each way, the corners of each muralba being marked by a stone pillar. A single line of base squares was laid down for the whole area, and these were extended by patw\u00e1r\u00eds; a certain amount of error resulted, but in each \"square\" the whole error was thrown into two lines of killas, so that each contained sixteen perfect killas and nine slightly imperfect. It was of course necessary to prepare special files to show exactly to what extent the boundaries of holdings had been adjusted and to ensure that each man obtained his fair share of the land; and in a similar manner it was necessary to adjust the boundaries of estates so as to make them follow as far as possible the lines of the square system. These processes were known as \"rectification\" and resulted in a very great simplification of the maps and records; moreover they greatly facilitated the distribution of water and the checking of crops, the calculation of demands, and the settlement of boundary disputes. A further refinement is the sub-division of killas into ki\u00e1ris or plots, for the greater economy of canal water.\n\nThe effects of rectification were embodied in a revised record-of-rights prepared by Mr. Hailey for all estates into which perennial irrigation was introduced.\n\nIn the Khush\u00e1b Tahs\u00edl a special revision of the record-of-rights in 1912-13 was sanctioned. In the river bed and the whole of the Thal new field maps were prepared by measurements based on traverses fixed by the Riverain Detachment of the Survey of India. All down the Jhelum, on both banks of the river, base squares were laid down and marked with stone pillars in such a way that the whole river-bed was mapped on a co-ordinated series of squares: intermediate survey marks were also fixed, and the patw\u00e1r\u00eds made their measurements from these on mapping sheets on which the location of these marks had been accurately plotted in the Survey Office. A similar system was\nfollowed in the Thal, which circle has now been mapped on a single system of co-ordinated squares. The great advantage of this arrangement is that it is perfectly easy to see whether the boundary between two villages is shewn identically in the maps of each, and much more easy than it ever was before to lay out an obliterated boundary so as to satisfy the owners on either side. It is hoped that there will be fewer boundary disputes in the future than there have been in the past.\n\nIn the remainder of the tahsil, i.e., in the upland portions of the Jhelum Circle, the Mohar, and the Hills, the new maps were made simply by showing alterations on a tracing of the settlement map. The results were only moderately satisfactory, but it is hoped that no serious difficulties will ensue. The jamabandis and other portions of the standing record were all brought up to date; special attention was paid to the complicated water-rights of the Hill and Mohar circles, and the measure of rights in village waste in the Thal.\n\nIn the Bhera and Shahpur Tahsils it was decided before settlement operations began that a revision of the record was unnecessary, and that a specially careful compilation of quadrennial jamabandis, accompanied by correction of the field maps, was sufficient. Remeasurement was therefore confined to the riverbed, and elsewhere the same system was followed as in the Hill and Mohar. Here also the results are only moderately satisfactory.\n\nOn the private canals of Bhera and Shahpur Tahsils, a fluctuating royalty rate is collected from the canal owners as a water-due under section 8 of the Minor Canals Act. This royalty rate was originally imposed at second settlement, at the rate of 4 annas per acre irrigated. At the third settlement the rate on crops was raised to 12 annas an acre matured, the rate on grass being left at 4 annas per acre irrigated. The canal-owners have applied for reconsideration of these orders, but it is admitted that the rates imposed are well within the margin of 25 per cent on the net profits from the water, which is the maximum payable according to the Act. The total receipts under this head, if the existing orders are maintained, will be about Rs. 24,000 per annum.\n\nSection D.\u2014Miscellaneous Revenue.\n\nThe revenue collections of recent years are given in Tables 39 (Fixed Land Revenue), 40 (Fluctuating Land Revenue and Miscellaneous Revenue), 41 (Excise), 42 (Income Tax) and 44 (General). In 1870 the gross revenue collections totalled about 4\u00bd lakhs of rupees; in 1897 they had risen to 7\u00bd lakhs; by 1910\nthey had risen to nearly 14 lakhs, exclusive of over 21\u00bd lakhs of canal direct revenue. Since then there has been still further development. The land revenue demand rose in 1913-14 to nearly 21 lakhs and when the new assessments are fully introduced in the area under fixed assessment, another 1\u00bd lakhs will be added. By 1917 the gross revenue will probably amount to about 26\u00bd lakhs of rupees, exclusive of some 2\u00bd lakhs of direct canal revenue, so that in 20 years it will have been more than trebled, and if canal revenue is counted, it will have been more than sextupled.\n\nThe Excise administration is supervised by the Assistant Commissioner, working under the control of the Deputy Commissioner, with an Inspector in general charge of the whole district, and a Sub-Inspector holding special charge of two tahsils. The subordinate staff consists of a Muharrir and three peons. There are no distilleries in the district; country spirit is obtained from the Rawalpindi distillery. There is one shop at Sargodha licensed to retail first class foreign liquor; each tahsil head-quarters has a shop licensed to retail other foreign liquor; 15 shops are licensed to retail country spirit; 13 to retail opium; and 10 to retail drugs. Travellers can also obtain liquid refreshment at Khushab Railway Station. Three druggists are licensed to sell cocaine for medical purposes, and 16 qualified medical men have been granted practitioners' licenses for this drug. 14 druggists are licensed to retail arsenic and other poisons for medical purposes, and 7 to retail denatured methylated spirit.\n\nThe income from excise averaged Rs. 22,014 for the 5 years previous to 1897: of this sum Rs. 11,865 were derived from liquor and Rs. 9,749 from drugs and opium. By 1910, the figures had risen to Rs. 44,249 (liquors Rs. 30,387; opium, Rs. 10,010; other drugs, Rs. 3,852). In 1911 new rules were brought into force, and the estimated revenue for 1915 is Rs. 47,676 (liquors, Rs. 30,891; opium, Rs. 12,000; other drugs, Rs. 4,805). The license for first class foreign liquors is sold for a fee fixed according to the average income from sales; all other licenses are sold by auction, subject to the payment of a fixed minimum, and to the approval of the highest bidder by the Collector.\n\nThe annual consumptions amount to about 1,200 gallons of foreign spirit, 200 gallons of beer, 5,000 gallons of country spirit (London proof), 600 seers of opium, 400 of charas, and 2,500 of bhang. The advent of Sikh colonists from the Central Punjab has led to an increased consumption of strong drinks; in 1914 a\n\n---\n\n*The drop of 4 lakhs in 1914-15 was due to remissions on the cotton crop in connection with the war.*\ngang of smugglers in Bhera started a lucrative illicit trade in opium with Bengal and Burma. Charas appears to be declining in popularity; cocaine has not established itself as a vice. There is a certain amount of illicit distillation in Sargodha Tahsil, but three cases have recently been successfully prosecuted, and the recently strengthened staff has effected a marked improvement in the administration: there is however scope for still further additions to the supervising establishment.\n\nIncome-tax is paid by five companies and 1,001 other firms and individuals in the district; the total demand is Rs. 39,867; in 1897 it was Rs. 15,926. When it is remembered that the taxation on account of land revenue and water rates and the value of proprietary rights have both increased by more than 500 per cent. in the same period, it would seem that income-tax assessments are relatively low. No less than 433 persons are assessed in the lowest grade at Rs. 20 each. The details by tahsils are these:\n\n| Tahsil | No. of Assessees | Total demand | Maximum paid by a single person | No. of persons in lowest grade |\n|--------|-----------------|--------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n|        | Companies | Others | Rs. | Rs. |                          |\n| Bhera  | 2         | 330     | 11,816 | 350 | 132                         |\n| Shahpur| 1         | 261     | 11,077 | 397 | 99                          |\n| Sargodha| 2       | 240     | 10,787 | 590 | 121                         |\n| Khushab|          | 170     | 6,187 | 412 | 71                          |\n\nIt must, however, be remembered that since 1897 the taxable minimum income has been raised from Rs. 500 to 1,000 per annum.\n\nThe total collections of revenue (including water rates) and other Government tax in the year 1910-11 were Rs. 37,38,677, and the population in March 1911 was 687,366, so the incidence was nearly Rs. 5-8-0 per head. It is difficult to say what the incidence is now: on the one hand, the revenue and taxes have been raised to nearly Rs. 48,00,000, and the population has been reduced by 38,400, owing to the cession of territory to Gujr\u00e1t District: but, on the other hand, public health has been on the whole good since 1911, and probably the rate of increase has been over 1\u00b75 per cent. per annum. The present population is probably not less than 7,00,000, so the incidence is about Rs. 6-14-0, exclusive of local rates, cesses, and municipal taxes. If these last be also reckoned in, the incidence is something like Rs. 7-8-0 per head of population. And we have seen that one worker supports, on an average, nearly two dependants, so it would seem that each worker\npays about Rs. 20 a year in taxes, and rates of various kinds.\n\nSection E.\u2014Local and Municipal Government.\n\nThe District Board consists of the chief executive officials and of the leading men of the district, and is presided over by the Deputy Commissioner as chairman. There are in all 54 members, of whom 13 are appointed by official designation, 7 are distinguished *ra\u00efs* appointed by name, and 34 are nominated to represent various local units. A list of present members is printed in the Appendix. The Board exercises control over the construction and maintenance of roads, the establishment and management of hospitals, dispensaries, *sar\u00e2\u00efs*, rest-houses and schools; the planting and preservation of trees; the management of cattle-pounds and public ferries; and other measures for the promotion of the health, comfort and convenience of the public. It has a good Board Office building in Sargodha where it meets about 11 times a year and where its staff works under the control of the Deputy Commissioner. Table No. 45 shows the income and expenditure of the District Board from 1901 to 1911. The gross income is now treble what it was thirteen years ago, partly owing to the increase in the land revenue and consequently in the local rate, partly owing to ferries, cattle-pounds and other properties having been made over to it for management by the Provincial Government, and partly owing to development of its own properties. Some idea of the extent to which the responsibilities and importance of the Board have increased may be formed by comparing the income and expenditure as they were in 1886 and 1896 and as they are now. In each case the figures are the average for the preceding three years:\n\n|                      | 1886   | 1896   | 1916   |\n|----------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Gross income         | Rs.    | Rs.    | Rs.    |\n|                      | 38,999 | 77,110 | 3,53,286 |\n| Income from Provincial rates | 32,539 | 49,085 | 1,65,778 |\n| Total expenditure    | Rs.    | Rs.    | Rs.    |\n|                      | 33,004 | 85,229 | 3,39,614 |\n| Expended on education| Rs.    | Rs.    | Rs.    |\n|                      | 7,000  | 18,000 | 74,150 |\n| \" medical relief     | Rs.    | Rs.    | Rs.    |\n|                      | 7,000  | 10,000 | 33,800 |\n| \" Public Works       | Rs.    | Rs.    | Rs.    |\n|                      | 9,500  | 20,000 | 1,78,000 |\n| \" minor Departments  | Rs.    | Rs.    | Rs.    |\n|                      | 3,900  | 11,000 | 21,700 |\nBut even these figures fail to represent the existing state of affairs. Expenditure on education (exclusive of buildings which is included under Public Works) had in 1914-15 risen to over Rs. 96,000, and since then the salaries of teachers have been raised, and the compulsory recurring expenditure on educational establishment alone will in future be over a lakh of rupees. In fact the Board is now so far committed to recurrent charges that it has practically no margin of income left for expenditure on new enterprises.\n\nThere are municipal committees in charge of the local administration of the towns of Bhera, Khush\u00e1b, Sah\u00edw\u00e1l, Mi\u00e1ni, and Sargodha. The constitution of each and a list of the members will be found in Appendix I.-F. The population of the towns has been discussed in Chapter I.-C.\n\nThe town of Bhera lies in north latitude 32\u00b0 22' and east longitude 72\u00b0 57' and contains a population of 15,202 souls. It lies near the left bank of the Jhelum, 30 miles east of Shahpur. It is still the head-quarters of a tahs\u00edl, and one of the largest and most imposing towns of the district, but it has to some extent been thrown into the shade by the rise of Sargodha and of Bhal-w\u00e1l, which will as soon as funds are available become the tahs\u00edl head-quarters: Bhera will then be a sub-tahs\u00edl, with a special N\u00e1ib Tahs\u00edld\u00e1r in charge. The municipality of Bhera was first constituted in 1867, and is of the second class, with 5 nominated and 10 elected members, and an elected president, at present the Tahs\u00edld\u00e1r. The average income, which at last settlement was Rs. 20,000 per annum, has now risen to Rs. 33,049, owing mainly to increases in the octroi rates. At one time the committee was notorious for its factiousness and pseudo-religious animosities, but lately there has been a marked improvement in this respect. The committee maintains several primary schools and the Dispensary, described in Chapter III; they are also endeavouring to carry out an ambitious drainage scheme, both intra- and extra-mural, which has been existent in embryo for the past 20 years or so. It is to be hoped that it may be safely brought to birth in the near future, as the town has suffered very severely from plague and fever in the last decade, and the population has declined since settlement by 2,426 souls. There are two honorary magistrates and a bench of four magistrates in the town, described in Chapter III-A. The inhabitants of Bhera are much addicted to employment in various Civil Services, and many of them have risen to high positions, both under Government and in Kashmir and other States.\n\nThe town is surrounded by a wall, partly kacha and partly pakka, with eight gates, of which the Lahori Gate to the\neast and the Th\u00e1nw\u00e1la to the north are the principal. It is the best looking town in the district, being built of brick throughout. There are some ancient buildings with wonderful wood-carving. There are also some gardens outside the town, among which Th\u00e1nw\u00e1la garden, and one in which the tomb of M\u00edr\u00e1n Said Mahammadi is built, are specially worthy of notice. It has a sar\u00e1i, detached tahsil and th\u00e1na, a dispensary, a female hospital, a veterinary hospital, a town hall and two high schools.\n\nThe early history of the town of Bhera is discussed at some length by General Cunningham in his \"Ancient Geography of India,\" pages 155 to 159, and Archaeological Survey Report, Volume XIV, pages 35 to 40. The original town stood on the right bank of the river, and in former days must have been a place of considerable note, for B\u00e1bar, in his autobiography, when speaking of his designs on Hindust\u00e1n, talks of the countries of Bhera, Khush\u00e1b, etc., and again in describing Hindust\u00e1n itself he defines the limits of the empire as extending from Bhera to Beh\u00e1r.* Some idea of its size may also be gained from the fact that it paid so large a sum as two lakhs of rupees to purchase its safety, when the troops under B\u00e1bar, disappointed of expected plunder in Bajaur, arrived before it in A.D. 1519. Soon after this, says tradition, the adjoining hill tribes descended and destroyed the city. The ruins of the old town still remain, and are known by the name of Jobnathnaggar. It is identified by General Cunningham as the capital of Sophites, or Sopheites, the contemporary of Alexander the Great.\u2020 The same author speaks of it as the refuge, and for some time the capital, of the Brahman kings of K\u00e1b\u00fal, expelled about the end of the 10th century by the Muhammadans.\n\nThe new town of Bhera was founded in A.D. 1540, during the reign of Sher Shah, near a spot where a holy man calling himself P\u00edr K\u00e1ya n\u00e1th had for some time been established, and where his followers are still residing round the tomb of their spiritual father. The place appears rapidly to have attained to its former size and importance, as it is one of the few places mentioned by name in the description of the Lahore S\u00faba given in the A\u00edn-i-Akbari, from which we also learn that it was the centre of a mahal which paid a revenue of nearly five lakhs of rupees, and was one of the few spots in the whole empire where money was coined. After being plundered and laid waste by N\u00far-ud-d\u00edn, as mentioned before, the town was repopulated by\n\n* Erskine's B\u00e1bar, pages 255 and 310.\n\u2020 Archaeological Report, 1863-64, page 42.\nthe Chiefs of the Bhangi misl, to whose share it fell in the division of the territory acquired by the Sikhs. Its appearance has been greatly improved under British rule.\n\nBhera is a place of considerable though now somewhat stagnant trade, its position as the terminus of a branch of the railway making it an emporium for the trade of the country to the south. A large colony of Khojas and Pirachas, Muhammadan converts from Hinduism, are settled here, and carry on a traffic with Kabul and countries beyond it. Rice, gur and sugar are imported from the Jullundur Doab; country cloth is exported to Kabul, Multan, Derajat and Sukkur. European cotton goods are brought from Amritsar and Karachi. Henna dye is exported to the value of a lakh of rupees yearly. The town is also famous for iron-smiths and stone-cutters as well as wood-carvers; and excellent felt and soap are manufactured, the former being exported in large quantities. A more detailed notice of some of these industries will be found in Chapter II.\n\nThe town of Khushab lies in north latitude $32^\\circ 17' 30''$ and east longitude $72^\\circ 24' 30''$, and contains a population of 10,159 souls. It is situated on the right bank of the Jhelum on the Lahore and Derajat road, about eight miles from Shahpur. Seen from the opposite bank of the river the town is picturesque. Being quite on the edge of the river, it has several times been washed away by the stream. Year by year the river has encroached on the banks, so that a portion of the inhabitants are in turn driven out of their houses and obliged to build away from the river. The town is partly surrounded by a kachha wall with four gates, of which the Lahori to the east and the Kashmiri to the north are the principal. There are no data for giving, with any degree of exactness, the year of foundation of Khushab. It is said by local tradition to have been built in A.D. 1508.* But it must have existed long before this, and is probably one of the oldest towns in this part of the Punjab, as it was a flourishing place in the time of Babar, and is frequently mentioned by him in his memoirs. Indeed, from the manner in which it is mentioned, it is clear that the old town must have existed when Babar's ancestor, Tamerlane, invaded Hindustan in A.D. 1398. The local tradition says that the founder of the town was Sikandar, son of Bahlol Khan, Lodhi, guided by the advice of Sayad Shah, Bokhari. Sikandar is supposed to have come to the Punjab, with a relative named Mir Pahlwan Khan, in the wake of Mir Chakar and Mir Jalal Khan, the Baloch invaders from\n\n*This is the date according to the numerical values of the letters of the town's name, according to the \"Abjad\" method,\nMekr\u00e1n, shortly after the retreat of Tamerlane. Amongst the most successful of the early rulers were Sard\u00e1r L\u00e1l Kh\u00e1n and his son J\u00e1far Khan. Extensive improvements were carried out by Sher Shah S\u00fari, who built the present Idg\u00e1h, and he is sometimes spoken of as the founder of the town. Very little, however, of the old town remains; for the last fifty years the river has been gradually cutting away its right bank at this spot, and with it have disappeared the gardens of the good Ahmady\u00e1r Kh\u00e1n, the fort built by Jafar Kh\u00e1n, Biloch, and nine-tenths of the older house. In Captain Davies' time, about 1865, a new town was laid out which, with its bazar thirty feet wide and more than half a mile in length, and its open streets, promises to surpass the former one. The Naw\u00e1b Ahmady\u00e1r Kh\u00e1n, mentioned above, was Governor of Khush\u00e1b, in Muhammad Shah's time, and his tomb, about a mile to the south-west of the new town, is still a place of pilgrimage.\n\nAnother shrine much visited by pilgrims from far and near is the \"Badsh\u00e1h Sahib,\" or tomb of the descendants of Hazrat P\u00edr Dastg\u00edr of Baghd\u00e1d, which stands to the south of the town.\n\nKhush\u00e1b carries on a large trade with Mult\u00e1n, Sukkur, Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n, and the Deraj\u00e1t, sending down cotton, wool and ghi to the two former, and country cloth to the latter, receiving in exchange English piece-goods, spices, iron, copper, etc., from Mult\u00e1n and Sukkur, dried fruits, madder, etc., from Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n, and sugar and gur from Amritsar and the Jullundur Do\u00e1b. It is the great mart for the grain of the Salt Range. The principal manufacture is that of coarse cloth and cotton scarves (lung\u00eds), there being some 600 weaving establishments in the town. The manufacture of art pottery has been commenced. A more detailed notice of some of the industries of the town will be found in Chapter II.\n\nThe public buildings are a tahs\u00edl, a th\u00e1na, a school, a dispensary, a sarai with rooms for travellers, and town hall. At Khush\u00e1b is the largest ferry in the district, as from here roads branch to Dera Ismail Khan, Mi\u00e1nw\u00e1l\u00ed, Pannu and Talagang through the Salt Range. A bridge of boats is maintained during the cold season. Khush\u00e1b is a changing station on the Sind-S\u00e1\u00edar Branch of the North-Western Railway and has a considerable population of Railway employees.\n\nThe town, thanks to its high position, and lack of irrigation, is comparatively healthy, but for the past few years the river has gone across to the far bank, and the inhabitants have had\nto go a mile or more for their drinking water. Expensive borings have however been made on the high bank, and a scheme for pumping water from a tube-well has been sanctioned, and will be carried out as soon as the financial situation becomes normal.\n\nThe municipality was founded in 1867, and is of the second class; there are nine members of the committee, all nominated, the president now being Sard\u00e1r Bah\u00e1dur Kh\u00e1n, Baloch. The annual income, which at settlement averaged Rs. 9,829, is now Rs. 20,834.\n\nThe town of S\u00e1h\u00edw\u00e1l lies in north latitude 31\u00b0 58' and east longitude 72\u00b0 22' and contains a population of 7,658 souls. It was formerly the head-quarters of a fiscal sub-division; it is one of the chief commercial towns of the district. It is not well built, and is completely surrounded by a kacha wall with six gates, of which the Lahori to the east and the Kashmiri to the north are the principal. The town is badly situated on a raised piece of ground, around which the surface drainage of the country for many miles round collects. The heavy rains of 1892 caused a severe epidemic of fever and in that year the death-rate was 97 per thousand per annum. A drainage scheme is badly wanted. It is said that S\u00e1h\u00edw\u00e1l was founded by Gul Bahlak, one of the ancestors of the Biloch Chiefs of this place, and was so named after \"Sai\" of the Jhammat caste, who was the manager of the property. At one time S\u00e1h\u00edw\u00e1l did a brisk trade with Mult\u00e1n and Sukkur in cotton, grain, and ghi, and was also the centre of the barilla industry, but since the advent of the Jech-Doab railway, the markets of Sill\u00e1nwali and Sargodha, 17 and 23 miles away, have absorbed nearly all the produce that once came to S\u00e1h\u00edw\u00e1l. The population has decreased from 9,210 at settlement, and this is due partly to the departure of shopkeepers and others to the rival marts, and partly to the lack of sanitation; plague was severe in 1904 and 1907. The only manufactures for which S\u00e1h\u00edw\u00e1l is noted are hardware and turnery in ivory and wood and lacquered work. The municipality of S\u00e1h\u00edw\u00e1l was first constituted in 1867; it is of the second class with three nominated and six elected members, the President being usually the Tahsild\u00e1r. The public buildings are schools for boys and girls, a dispensary, a veterinary hospital, a sar\u00e1\u00ed with rest-house attached, a town hall and a police station.\n\nThe municipal income has risen from Rs. 7,750 to Rs. 15,000 owing to the raising of octroi rates, and the narrowing of octroi limits. Up till recently the entire revenue estate was included\nin the municipal boundary, with the result that the Alienation of Land Act did not apply: this has now been rectified, and it is to be hoped that the original Jhammat and Biloch owners will be successful in retaining such of their lands as are left to them.\n\nThere is a bench of two Honorary Magistrates, and an honorary Civil Judge.\n\nThe town of Mi\u00e1ni lies in north latitude $32^\\circ 31' 48\"$ and east longitude $73^\\circ 7' 30\"$, and contains a population of 5,819. It is situated on the left bank of the Jhelum, opposite Pind D\u00e1dan Khan. The old town was an ill-built place of narrow lanes and laz\u00e1srs, the upper storeys of the houses and shops almost touching each other, and was not surrounded by any wall; but in Captain Davies' time, about 1865, a new and commodious square was erected, named Daviesganj, and a wall with gates built round the east part of the town. From time immemorial Mi\u00e1ni was an important mart for the salt from the mines on the opposite side of the river. The original town was called Shamshabad. This was swept away by the river, and a town on the present site was built under the auspices of Asaf Kh\u00e1n, father-in-law of the Emperor Shah Jeh\u00e1n, by two Hind\u00fas, M\u00e1dh\u00f3 D\u00e1s and Shib R\u00e1m. Like Bhera, it grew and prospered till the decline of the Mughal monarchy, and, like Bhera, it was plundered and destroyed by N\u00far-ud-D\u00edn, General of Ahmad Shah, in A.D. 1754, and the inhabitants were dispersed in the neighbouring villages. In A.D. 1787, Maha Singh, father of Ranjit Singh, induced a number of the descendants of the old residents and others to rebuild the town, and re-opened the salt mart; but it appears never to have entirely recovered N\u00far-ud-d\u00edn's visitation, for the descendants of the families which then abandoned the place and took refuge in the adjoining villages are still to be found in them. The prosperity of the town has lately suffered a severe blow of a different kind. Until the extension of the railway to the Khewr\u00e1 salt mines across the river, Mi\u00e1ni was the depot for the salt exported from those mines down country, and from this fact was known as L\u00fan Mi\u00e1ni, but since then the salt trade has almost left it, and its glory has departed. It still, however, does a considerable trade in lime-burning. Its population has decreased by more than 25 per cent. since 1881. Mi\u00e1ni lies low and is subject to floods and fever; in 1892 the death rate was 73 per thousand per annum. A drainage scheme is being devised. Plague was very severe in 1904 and 1907.\n\nThe municipality of Mi\u00e1ni was at first constituted in 1867. It is a municipality of the second class with 3 nominated and 6\nelected members, the elected president at present being the Naib Tahsildar. The annual income for the last five years has averaged Rs. 17,542, as against Rs. 7,378 at settlement. The public buildings are a police station, a dispensary, a town hall, a school, and a serai with rest-house attached. There is also a railway station.\n\nThere is an Honorary Magistrate and Civil Judge of the 1st class. The \"feast of lamps,\" on the occasion of the Diwali festival, is here celebrated by much gambling, but measures are being taken to put a stop to this.\n\nThe foundation stone of Sargodha Town was laid on 22nd February 1903. At first the town was maintained from the town improvement fund, the chief source of income being the sale of nasil lands. In 1907 a notified area committee was constituted with 4 nominated members and the Sub-Divisional Officer as ex-officio President. In 1909 Sargodha Civil Station was incorporated in the notified area. Sargodha municipality was constituted in 1914. It is of the second class with 12 members, all nominated, 4 officials and 8 non-officials. The Deputy Commissioner is ex-officio President. The town is divided into 8 wards for municipal purposes. The municipal area including the town proper and the Civil Station is supplied with water from water-works. Lighting is furnished by gas lamps, both being maintained by the municipality. Further, the municipality maintains a garden which is situated between the Civil Station and the town proper. The income and expenditure of the municipality are detailed below:\n\n| Year   | Income (Rs.) | Expenditure (Rs.) |\n|--------|--------------|-------------------|\n| 1914-15| 37,931       | 31,419            |\n| 1915-16| 49,153       | 45,853            |\n\nthus giving an average of Rs. 43,567 as annual income and Rs. 38,636 as annual expenditure.\n\nThe chief sources of income at present are a house-tax, a water-tax, rent of shops, city sweepings, lambardari fee, lease of municipal lands, and a terminal-tax.\n\nThe main heads of expenditure are:\n\nWater-works, lighting, conservancy, and the garden.\n\nThe chief buildings of interest in the town proper are the Jamma Mosque, the Gurdawara, the Arya Samaj, and the Mission Reading Room. The public buildings are:\u2014the Municipal Hall,\nthe District Board School, the Zail House, and the Rudkin Library in the Municipal Garden.\n\nThere are 8 ginning factories which are described in Chapter II. In the Civil Station there are the following public buildings:\u2014the Public Works Office, the Army Remount Office, the Canal Offices, the Post Office, the Railway Office, the District Board Office, the Session Judge's Court, the District Courts, the Police Lines, the Tahsil, the Police Station, the Jail, the Civil Rest-House, the Public Works Department Rest-House, and the Canal Rest-House.\n\nBesides the 15 bungalows occupied by Government officials as residential houses, there are also about 32 bungalows owned by private individuals. The population at the last census amounted to 8,849 souls. However it has now considerably increased owing to the removal of the head-quarters of the district to this place and consequent exodus from Shahpur. Sargodha is a fairly healthy place except for the almost annual visitation of the plague. It is the chief centre of trade in the district and exports very large quantities of grain to Karachi and several European firms have established agencies here.\n\nIn addition to the District Courts, Mr. P. N. Broadway works as an Honorary Magistrate in the cold weather, and there is also a bench, described in Chapter III.\n\nIn 1915-16 the incidence of taxation in the five municipalities was as follows:\n\n| Municipality | Population | Income from taxation | Incidence per head of population |\n|--------------|------------|----------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Bhera        | 15,202     | 27,191               | 1 12 7                           |\n| Mian\u00e9        | 5,819      | 11,406               | 1 15 4                           |\n| Khushab      | 10,159     | 15,590               | 1 8 6                            |\n| Sahiwal      | 7,658      | 10,954               | 1 6 10                           |\n| Sargodha     | 8,849      | 13,804               | 1 8 0                            |\n\nThere are five towns in the district\u2014Shahpur, Shahpur Civil Station, Bhalwal, Phularw\u00e1n, and Sillanw\u00e1li\u2014which are Notified Areas, and managed by committees, the membership of which is given in Appendix I.-E. Of these Bhalwal will probably become a regular municipality, as soon as the tahsil head-quarters are moved there from Bhera. Like Phularw\u00e1n and Sillanw\u00e1li it is mainly notable for its market (mandi), which has been described in Chapter II-F. It is also the Makka of all those who suffer from eye-troubles, especially cataract; the dispensary is described in Chapter III-J. Bhalwal, Phularw\u00e1n and Sillanw\u00e1li are all\nquite new foundations, and owe their existence to the Railway. Up to now their history has been only that of birth and rapid growth.\n\nShahpur is a small town with 5,608 inhabitants, situated at a distance of about two miles from the Jhelum river. Formerly it was on the very bank of this river, which has of late been receding in the direction of Khush\u00e1b. Shahpur with the adjoining villages, Nathuw\u00e1la, Jal\u00e1lpur and Kotla-Sayad\u00e1n, was founded by the Sayads who still form the proprietary body. The common ancestor was Shah Shamas, whose tomb may still be seen near Shahpur. The original tomb was to the north of the town, and was washed away by the river, when the coffin was removed to its present site, east of the town. He is now worshipped as a saint and a large fair is annually held in his honour between 23rd and 25th Chet (the beginning of April). A large number of people (about 15 thousand) come from distant places to pay their homage to this saint at his shrine, which is shaded by a grove of trees. His son Shah Muhammad\u2019s tomb is situated to the west of the town, and has recently been renewed in the modern style. He is also worshipped as a saint like his father, but no separate fair is held in his honour. The town lies on the road from Lahore to Dera Ismail Khan and has some trade in country cloth. It is 23 miles from Sargodha, now the headquarters of the district and 5 miles from Khush\u00e1b. The road to Khush\u00e1b turns off at a right angle immediately in front of a picturesque gate which leads to the only bazar, of which the town can boast.\n\nThere are four schools in the town. In the western corner of the town may be seen the low kacha walls of what was once a fort of the Sayads, the site of which Najaf Sh\u00e1h, Zaild\u00e1r, still occupies; while outside the town and further east of the shrine of Shah Shamas, about one mile from the fort of the Sayads, are the ruins of an old Sikh fort.\n\nThis town was formerly a second class municipality in the Punjab, but since 1907 it has been converted into a Notified Area. The committee consists of 5 members, the Tahsild\u00e1r is the President and the remaining 4 are nominated members.\n\nThe original site of the head-quarters station was within the boundaries of Nathuw\u00e1la on the riverside of Shahpur town, but the houses having been washed down in the great flood of 1849, the present site was selected about three miles to the east of Shahpur town on the road to Lahore. The wisdom of the selection was proved in the great flood of July 1893, when the Civil Station was an island surrounded by water on all sides for several\nThe station has a small baz\u00e1r neatly laid out with fairly wide streets. The roads are wide and well shaded by trees and are watered in the hot weather from an inundation canal, which runs through the station. Picturesque glimpses of the Salt Range close the view to the west. Good crops of grain and grass are raised in the lands attached to the station, chiefly by the aid of canal irrigation. The station has a large hospital, two schools, two tanks, three public gardens, three rest-houses, and a sar\u00e1i called Malik Sahib Khan W\u00e1la.\n\nUp till April 1914, the Civil Station was the district headquarters; the old District Courts are now used as a tahs\u00edl, the tahs\u00edl having been made over to the Isl\u00e1mia High School, recently founded. The Deputy Commissioner's house and office are occupied by the Sub-Divisional Officer of Khush\u00e1b; the jail is being temporarily used as a sanitarium for consumptive prisoners. But though the station still retains some of its importance, it has been hard hit by its loss of prestige. Perhaps it will revive if it becomes a junction for the R\u00e1ewind-Khush\u00e1b and Bhera-Shahpur Railways. The annual horse fair, which was abandoned in 1914, has again been revived, much to the satisfaction of the residents. For several years past, Shahpur has had the lowest death-rate of any town in the Province; the drinking water is for the most part brackish, but apparently its cathartic properties are beneficial.\n\nThe Notified Area is managed by a committee of three members, the Sub-Divisional Officer, the Assistant Surgeon and the Tahsild\u00e1r, but their energies are devoted entirely to watch and ward, lighting and conservancy. There is an honorary magistrate who sits in the tahs\u00edl building, and a civil judge.\n\nThis mandi was opened in 1903 on the Jech Do\u00e1b Railway at the railway station of Bhalwal so named after the old proprietary village. It is on the south-west of Bhera, at a distance of 11 miles, and 28 miles west of Malakw\u00e1l. The mandi lies in the middle of the most fertile part of the Jhelum Colony and commands a large tract of the country in Bhera Tahs\u00edl, comprising a large number of Colony chaks and proprietary villages irrigated by the Lower Jhelum Canal. It is the head-quarters of a sub-tahs\u00edl and contains a police station and a flourishing mandi.\n\nThe following roads connect the mandi with the chaks and villages:\n\n- On the north-east ... Bhera-Bhalwal.\n- ,, north ... Shahpur-Chakr\u00e1md\u00e1s and Shahpur Lak.\n- ,, south ... Kot Moman-Lali\u00e1n\u00ed.\nIn 1907 the export by rail amounted to 3 lacs of maunds of wheat, toria and cotton, and since then it has been increasing. The mandi contains 231 shops, 137 residential houses, 3 cotton factories, 3 large European firms, police station, sub-tahsil, dispensary, a Vernacular Middle School, post and telegraph office, a rest-house and a public serai. Population according to the census of 1911 is 1,400, but has since then nearly trebled with the increase in trade. It will increase still further when the tahsil head-quarters are moved here from Bhera. Before 1909, the conservancy and chaukidara charges were met from the Town Fund and chaukidara taxes respectively. The increase in the population necessitated the constitution of the town as a Notified Area. Accordingly the area was notified by Punjab Gazette Notification No. 375, dated May 3rd, 1909, and a tax at the rate of 9 pies per annum on the annual value of all buildings was levied to meet the expenses. The committee consists of 5 members including the Naib Tahsildar as ex-officio member and president. Details of imports and exports of the Notified Area will be found in the table on page 303.\n\nThis mandi was opened in 1903 on the Jech Doab Railway at a railway station named Phularwan after the name of the old proprietary village.\n\nIt is on the south of Bhera at a distance of 8 miles and 19 miles west of Malakwal.\n\nThe mandi commands a large tract of the country to the east of the district in the Bhera Tahsil, including a few colony chaks and a large number of the proprietary villages irrigated by the Lower Jhelum Canal, the produce of which is brought here for sale and exported chiefly to Karachi.\n\nThe mandi is connected with the Colony chaks and proprietary villages which are approached on the north by the Bhera-Phularwan, on the south-east by the Miaana-Gondal-Bhabhra via Salam and on the south by the Kot Moman-Midh Ranjha roads.\n\nIn 1910 the export by rail amounted to 275,000 maunds, chiefly of wheat, toria and cotton, and since then it has been increasing.\n\nThe mandi is a promising one consisting of shops, residential houses, two cotton factories, three large European firms, a school, a Civil rest-house, a post and telegraph office and a public serai. Population according to the census of 1911 is 777 souls, but this census was taken at a season when many of the inhabitants had\nleft the place on account of plague; and it may now be fairly estimated at three times the above figures.\n\nBefore 1911, the conservancy and chaukid\u00e1ra charges were paid from the town funds and the chaukid\u00e1ra taxes respectively. The funds were administered by the Colonization Officer. The increase of the population made it necessary for the mandi to be constituted a notified area which was effected by Gazette notification No. 528, dated 19th September 1911, and a tax at the rate of Re. 0-0-9 in the rupee per annum on the annual value of all occupied buildings was levied to meet the town expenses.\n\nThe committee consists of three members, one being official, and two non-official, with the Tahsild\u00e1r as ex-officio President.\n\nDetails of the imports and exports of the mandi will be found on page 303.\n\nThis mandi was opened in 1903 on the Jech Do\u00e1b Railway at a railway station Sillanw\u00e1l\u00ed so named after an old hamlet in its neighbourhood. It is south of and at a distance of 17 miles from Sahiw\u00e1l and 8 miles from Bar\u00e1na in the Jhang District to the north.\n\nThe mandi commands a larger tract of country than any other mandi in the Jhelum Colony; serving more than 200 Crown and proprietary villages irrigated by the Lower Jhelum Canal. The produce of these villages is brought here for sale and exported chiefly to Kar\u00e1chi.\n\nThe whole of the country is connected with the mandi by important roads in every direction, which offer every facility to the zamind\u00e1rs and merchants for the disposal of their produce. In 1910 the export by rail amounted to 420,000 maunds of wheat, t\u00f3ria and cotton and is increasing annually.\n\nThe mandi consists of shops, residential house, 4 factories, 5 large European firms, a th\u00e1na, a school, post and telegraph office, a rest-house and medical dispensary and municipal ser\u00e1i. Population according to the census of 1911 is 1,050 souls, but this census was taken at a season when many of the inhabitants had gone to their original homes, and it may now be estimated at three times the above figure.\n\nBefore 1910 the conservancy and chaukid\u00e1ra charges were paid from the town fund and ekaukid\u00e1ra taxes respectively. The increase in the population necessitated the constitution of the town as a notified area, and for the improved arrangements of conservancy\nand lighting, the area was declared a notified area in Gazette notification No. 813, dated 13th December 1910, and a tax at the rate of 9 pies in the rupee on the annual value of all buildings was levied to meet the expenses.\n\nThe committee consists of 5 members including the Tahsild\u00e1r as ex-officio member and president.\n\nThe detail of imports and exports of the notified areas will be found in the table below.

The Department builds and maintains works for the following departments:\n\nI: Imperial ... (a) Civil\u2014(i) Post and Telegraph.\n(ii) Ecclesiastical (churches and cemeteries).\n(b) Military, Army Remounts (i) Sargodha Depot.\n\n(ii) Jhelum Canal Colony Circle.\n\nII. Provincial ... All works and repairs carried out under Budget head \u201c45\u2014Civil Works.\u201d\n\nFor Local Bodies, all estimates exceeding Rs. 2,500 are scrutinised in advance of construction, and advice is given gratis for other projects.\n\nThe chief works recently carried out have been (1) the Police lines and quarters, the sub-jail, the enlargement of the District Office, and three official residences in the new district head-quarters, (2) a police station and quarters at Khush\u00e1b; (3) two new rest-houses in the Salt Range.\n\nThe principal projects about to be undertaken are (1) the extramural drainage of Bhera, (2) Tahsil at Bhalwal, (3) Police Station and quarters for Sargodha City.\n\nThe total expenditure for the last five years has been \u2014\n\n| Year    | Rs.     |\n|---------|---------|\n| 1911-12 | 2,52,000|\n| 1912-13 | 5,00,000|\n| 1913-14 | 4,00,000|\n| 1914-15 | 4,20,000|\n| 1915-16 | 3,25,000|\n\nSection G.\u2014Army.\n\nThere are no cantonments or troops in the district, but it has provided a very large number of recruits both for Cavalry and Infantry. The 18th King George\u2019s Own Tiw\u00e1na Lancers are specially connected with the district, and the 9th Cavalry (Hodson\u2019s Horse); the 13th Lancers, 15th Lancers, 17th Lancers, 36th Jacob\u2019s Horse, and the 39th King George\u2019s Own Central India Horse all recruit largely from the Tiw\u00e1nas, Aw\u00e1ns and Baloches. Of the Native Infantry regiments perhaps the 24th, 40th, 54th, 55th, 57th, 125th, and 129th are those which attract most men from this district. The 53rd Sillad\u00e1ri Camel Corps has its headquarters at Sargodha, and spends the grazing season in the Salt Range. The late Jamadar Muhammad Kh\u00e1n of Bajar was adjudged to be the best man-at-arms at the Delhi Darb\u00e1r. Subed\u00e1r Zam\u00e1n Kh\u00e1n of Wahir won the Military Cross in Flanders. And many other residents of this district have reached high positions in all branches of the service. A\nlist of military distinctions and of retired officers of Commissioned rank will be found in the Appendix.\n\n**Section H.\u2014Police and Jails.**\n\nThe district lies within the Western Police Range of the Province under the control of the Deputy Inspector-General of Police\u2014whose head-quarters are at Rawalpindi. The police force is controlled by a District Superintendent of Police, with headquarters at Sargodha; an Assistant Superintendent is generally in charge of the Khush\u00e1b Tahsil and part of Shahpur.\n\nThe strength of the force on 1st July 1915 was as follows:\n\n| Rank                  | Grade | Salary per mensem | No. of officers |\n|-----------------------|-------|-------------------|-----------------|\n| Inspectors (6)        | III   | 175 0 0           | 3               |\n|                       | IV    | 150 0 0           | 3               |\n|                       | II    | 80 0 0            | 5               |\n| Sub-Inspectors (26)   | III   | 70 0 0            | 6               |\n|                       | IV    | 60 0 0            | 11              |\n|                       | V     | 50 0 0            | 4               |\n| Head Constables (79)  | I     | 20 0 0            | 17              |\n|                       | II    | 17 8 0            | 27              |\n|                       | III   | 15 0 0            | 35              |\n| Constables            |       | 9 8 0             | 545             |\n\nThese figures include one mounted Head Constable and four mounted constables. The salaries of the force amount to Rs. 1,10,158 per annum.\n\nThese 657 members of the Force were distributed as follows:\n\n| Standing guards and fixed duties | Protection and detection | Reserve |\n|----------------------------------|--------------------------|---------|\n| Inspectors                       | 2                        | 4       |\n| Sub-Inspectors                   | 6                        | 18      |\n| Head Constables                  | 27                       | 49      |\n| Constables                       | 109                      | 330     |\n| Total                            | 144                      | 401     | 112     |\nIn 1897 there were altogether 445 Police in the district of whom 100 were municipal; of this number 291 only were employed in protective and detective work. Municipal police no longer exist, their duties having been taken over by the Provincial Service. There is now one Police Officer engaged in protective and detective work for every 1,714 persons resident in the district, as against one for every 1,696 persons in 1897, so that the strength of the force has been increased practically in the same ratio as the total population. The duties of watch and ward are however shared with the regular Police force by the Village Watchmen or Chawkid\u00e1rs who are described below.\n\nThe following is a list of the Police Stations and Circles in the district: the former are under the charge of a Sub-Inspector and the latter of an Inspector of Police:\n\n| Tahsil | Serial No. | Police Station       | Circle |\n|--------|------------|----------------------|--------|\n|        | 1          | Sargodha Sadr        |        |\n| Sargodha |            | Sargodha City       | Sargodha |\n|        | 3          | Sill\u00e1nw\u00e1ll          |        |\n|        | 4          | Kir\u00e1\u00faa              |        |\n|        | 5          | Sah\u00edw\u00e1l             |        |\n| Shahpur |            | Shahpur             | Shahpur |\n|        | 7          | Jhawari\u00e1n           |        |\n|        | 8          | Mitha Tiw\u00e1na        |        |\n|        | 9          | N\u00farpur              |        |\n| Khush\u00e1b |            | Khush\u00e1b             | Khush\u00e1b |\n|        | 11         | Nausbehra           |        |\n|        | 12         | Uttera              |        |\n|        | 13         | Katha Sagral        |        |\n|        | 14         | Bhalw\u00e1l             |        |\n|        | 15         | Kot Moman           |        |\n| Bhera  |            | Midh R\u00e1njh\u00e1         | Bhalwal |\n|        | 17         | Bhera               |        |\n|        | 18         | Mi\u00e1nl               |        |\n\nThere is a first class outpost at Padhrar and second class road posts are at Dhrema, Mitha Lak, Bhagt\u00e1nw\u00e1la, Laksin, and Chak R\u00e1m D\u00e1s.\n\nThere are punitive posts at Kot Moman, Khura, and Choha.\nCattle pounds are attached to all Police Stations except Sargodha City and Katha Saghral; the last-named makes use of a District Board pound at Katha Masral. There are other pounds at Mitha Lak and Nikdur in Sargodha Tahsil, at Nihang in Shahpur, and at Jaura, Kund, Pail, Rajar, Girot, Nurow\u00e1na, Sodhi Jaiw\u00e1la, and Sakesar in Khush\u00e1b. These are all kept up by the District Board, and are in charge of some local official, such as the schoolmaster.\n\nThe duties of watch and ward in the villages are performed by village servants, known as chaukid\u00e1rs whose numbers are as follows:\n\n| Tahsil | Sanctioned number of watchmen | Average rural population per watchman | Average number of residential houses per watchman |\n|--------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n| Bhera  | 269                           | 610                                  | 138                                              |\n| Shahpur| 224                           | 559                                  | 130                                              |\n| Khush\u00e1b| 251                           | 660                                  | 155                                              |\n| Sargodha| 314                          | 425                                  | 90                                               |\n\nThe usual rate of pay is Rs. 5 per month, but a certain number, who rank as dafadd\u00e1rs, get more, and two in Sargodha get less. In the Colony estates, in addition to their pay, the chaukid\u00e1rs are given 3 or 5 killas of land to cultivate. The salaries are paid out of village cesses, such as kami\u00e1na, or out of a special tax, known as chaukid\u00e1ra, which is generally paid by householders according to the relative value of their houses, the very poor being exempted:\n\n| Number of villages in which chaukid\u00e1rs are paid | Bhera | Shahpur | Khush\u00e1b | Sargodha |\n|-------------------------------------------------|-------|---------|---------|----------|\n| (a) Entirely from kami\u00e1na or other village cess | 29    | ...     | ...     | ...      |\n| (b) Entirely from chaukid\u00e1ra cess                | 207   | 80      | 99      | 425      |\n| (c) Partly from a village cess and partly from chaukid\u00e1ra | 29    | 164     | 49      | ...      |\nWherever the watchmen are unable to cope with thieves and burglars a system of patrols by the villagers themselves has been organized by the headmen, at the instance of the District Magistrate and Superintendent of Police. Each householder has to take his turn to serve on a patrol, according to lot, or else to make some contribution to the expenses of lighting; hence the system is known as *thikri pahra*.\n\nThe only form of crime for the detection of which any special staff exists is cattle theft, which has already been fully discussed. Finger-prints of all persons 'known to the Police' are taken and sent to the Phillaur bureau for record. There is a case on record in which the bureau was asked to report, if possible, the identity of a corpse which had decayed past recognition. The bureau identified the finger-prints without difficulty, but assigned them to an individual who happened to be alive in the jail at the time. It was then ascertained that the officer, who had been deputed to take the corpse's finger-prints, had fought shy of handling corrupt flesh, and rashly hoped that the Galton system might not be infallible.\n\nThe number of cognizable cases reported to the Police year by year will be found in Table 48, together with the number sent for trial, and the proportion of convictions. The number of cases which ended in conviction was in 1901 as high as 52 per cent. of the number of cases reported and 74 per cent. of the cases sent for trial. Thereafter, the number of convictions failed to keep pace with the increase in cases reported, and by 1911, though the reported cases had more than doubled, only 31 per cent. of them (representing 71 per cent. of cases sent for trial) resulted in conviction. A great improvement was effected in 1912 by Major O'Brien as District Magistrate and Mr. Cocks as Superintendent of Police. In that year 43 per cent. of the reported cases and 74 per cent. of the decided cases resulted in convictions. Order was restored in the Salt Range, which had been at the mercy of a few desperate characters, and public confidence in the efficacy of the criminal law was greatly increased.\n\nThe few S\u00e1ns\u00eds in the district are comparatively inoffensive, and vagrant Bhawarias do little harm. There is a considerable amount of organized crime in the matter of cattle theft, but in this nearly all the tribes of the Thal, B\u00e1r, and riverain take a hand. Favourite clearing-houses for stolen cattle are at Dravi in the Northern Thal, Jatoiw\u00e1la in the extreme south, and near the Lagh\u00e1ri plantation on the banks of the Jhelum. The village of Padhrar in the north-east corner of Khush\u00e1b Tahsil was for\nyears so given up to bad characters that it was necessary to establish a Police outpost there permanently; it has now turned over a new leaf, and provided a large number of men for the army. Kh\u00e1n Muhammadw\u00e1la, to the south of Bhera town, may be considered a criminal village, being hopelessly incorrigible in the matter of cattle-lifting. From time to time some individual becomes notorious as a man who will stick at nothing; such are Sult\u00e1n of Hamoka, who had to be surrounded and starved into surrender; Shera of Malwal, who had a very long list of murders to his credit; Masti and Il\u00e1hu of Padhrar, who tyrannized the Salt Range; and three Musall\u00eds of Khabakki, who would commit a murder for Rs. 5 apiece.\n\nThere was formerly a 3rd class District Jail at Shahpur, in charge of the Civil Surgeon, with accommodation for 265 males and 10 females, and a daily average attendance of about 200 prisoners. The transfer of the district head-quarters to Sargodha has led to the institution of a sub-jail at that station, and the old District Jail has now been converted into a temporary sanitarium for all prisoners in the Punjab suffering from tubercular complaints. The number and accommodation of lock-ups is shown in Table 49. There is no reformatory in the district.\n\nSection I.\u2014Education and Literacy.\n\nTable No. 50 gives statistics of education as ascertained at the census of 1911 for each religion and for the total population of each tahs\u00edl. Statistics regarding the attendance at Government and Aided Schools will be found in Table No. 51, and a brief account of these institutions will be found below.\n\nThe progress made in the education of boys is in some sense indicated by the following figures:\n\n| Years | Number of male lit. rates | Percentage of male literates to male population |\n|-------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| 1881  | 1,588                    | 4\u00b78                                           |\n| 1891  | 16,665                   | 6\u00b74                                           |\n| 1901  | 20,684                   | 7\u00b76                                           |\n| 1911  | 24,886                   | 6\u00b76                                           |\n|       | Bhera                    | 8,353                                         |\n|       | Shahpur                  | 5,496                                         |\n|       | Khush\u00e1b                  | 4,580                                         |\n|       | Sargodha                 | 6,457                                         |\nThis compares quite favourably with the standard of the Province, for which the percentage is 6\u00b73; Shahpur was one of very few districts which showed an increase in the number of male literates from 1901 to 1911, and the diminished percentage is due to the much stricter test of literacy now insisted on, viz., the ability to write a letter and read the answer to it. On the other hand in 1891, there were in addition to the 16,605 'literates' 4,528 boys described as 'learning', i.e., still at school, and doubtless many of these had learnt to read and write. There can be no complaint about the rate of numerical progress; in fact there is a real danger that the boys and the buildings may outgrow the masters, and that the District Board may find it has cut its gown a little too big for its cloth.\n\nThe figures in the margin show the percentage of literates among boys of various stages of growth: the Provincial average for the 15-20 stage is only 7\u00b78. The suggestion that the generation now growing up is producing fewer scholars than the \"giants of old\" is certainly due to some defect in the statistics, but it is remarkable that it appears not only in the figures for the whole Province and nearly every district of the Province, but also in the return for 1891. Mr. Wilson suggested that literacy might be conducive to length of days, but it must be confessed that this seems rather fanciful. A more likely explanation is that young men of 21, 22 or over will, if they are educated, return their ages correctly, whereas if they are illiterate they will be very apt to guess 20, or to give the enumerator a field of choice, in which 20 is the 'glaring' number.\n\nThe Mussulm\u00e1n population is very backward in comparison with the Hind\u00fas and the Sikhs. They made practically no headway in the 20 years preceding the last census. There has, however, been a considerable advancement of learning since 1911 among the peasants, due to a very fortunate combination of propitious circumstances. Government was able to display great munificence in the matter of educational projects; the Deputy Commissioner, Major O'Brien, C.I.E., was an enthusiast and a propagator of enthusiasm, and several of the most influential landowners of the district\u2014notably Naw\u00e1b Mub\u00e1riz\nKh\u00e1n and Qureshi Muhammad Hay\u00e1t\u2014were alive to the necessity of mental development for any faith that aspires to be respected as either a Church or a State. The Shahpur Isl\u00e1mia High School ought to effect a marked improvement in the proportion of brain to muscle among Muhammadans. It will be observed that the Hind\u00fas and Sikhs show a falling off since 1901; in the former case this is probably due merely to stricter definition; among the Sikhs, the incursion of illiterate husbandmen has had a marked effect on a class that were formerly given over to commercial and literary pursuits. The sudden collapse of Christian scholarship suggested by the figures is a greatly exaggerated instance of the same thing: in this case the highways and byways have furnished nearly the whole company.\n\nAlthough no detailed statistics for the district are given either in Volume II or in the Provincial Census Report, it would appear that the percentage of literates is highest among the learned professions, shopkeepers, and traders; the priestly and levitical castes (Brahman, Sayyad, Qureshi, Ulema) also show a fairly high proportion of educated men. The artizan classes are beginning to show considerable keenness in school-going, the Mir\u00e1s\u00eds and the weavers being especially ardent.\n\nAlthough there are only 8 literates to every thousand females in the district, this represents a fourfold increase in the number since last settlement. The Shahpur Tahs\u00edl, with a proportion of 12 per thousand, is easily the most progressive, and this is probably due to the enterprise of R\u00e1\u00ed S\u00e1hib D\u00edw\u00e1n Chand, whose Shahpur Girls\u2019 School was one of the best in the Province for years. The Mussalm\u00e1n woman is still very shy of schools, but the Sikh girls show a good average of enlightenment. Unlike the boys, the girls under 20 make a better show than the grown-ups; but the education imparted is still very elementary, and progress is bound to be slow: the difficulty is that very few of the peasantry realize that intellect in a woman is an advantage, and unfortunate incidents not infrequently seem to point a reactionary moral; as for instance, in the cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre in which a maiden\u2019s intercepted love letter caused a young man to be packed up in kerosine tins.\n\n| Religion | Number of Literates | Percentage |\n|----------|--------------------|------------|\n| Hindu    | 1,143              | 3\u00b75        |\n| Sikh     | 1,179              | 8\u00b70        |\n| Mussalm\u00e1n| 176                | 0\u00b76        |\n| Christian| 97                 | 2\u00b76        |\n\n| Age      | Percentage |\n|----------|------------|\n| 0-10     | 1          |\n| 10-15    | 1\u00b74        |\n| 15-20    | 2\u00b70        |\n| Over 20  | 1\u00b70        |\n| All ages | 3          |\nThere are 2,348 persons in the district able to read and write English, as against 301 in 1891; the proportion of English literates (6 males and 3 females per mille of total in each case) is lower than the provincial average (8 and 1 respectively); of the total 2,253 are males and 95 females, and out of these 112 males and 82 females are Christians. Of the men, Hind\u00fas, Christians and Sikhs can boast percentages of 3\u00b72, 2\u00b73, and 1\u00b74 respectively; Christian women also reach 2\u00b72 per cent.; but the numbers of all other women and all Mussalm\u00e1ns of both sexes literate in English is quite insignificant. An interesting speculation, which does not lend itself to statistical treatment, is the degree to which English words are finding their way into the vocabulary of the common peasant: the majority of these words are borrowed from the technical jargon of some Government Department, and their adoption into the vernacular means a real increase in the mental stock-in-trade of the locality. Sometimes an English word will acquire a curiously specialised meaning in the course of adoption; the most interesting example of this is the word \"Fund,\" which now is quite definitely assigned to fraudulent methods of business.\n\nIn Table 51 will be found figures showing the number of schools and scholars of various standards, while Table 52 shows what sums have been spent each year on education. In the twenty years between 1891 and 1911 the number of literates increased from 17,080 to 27,483, and the percentage of literates to the total population rose from 3\u00b75 to 4\u00b70. Since 1911, the rate of the progress has been considerably more rapid, thanks to a fortunate combination of financial abundance and administrative energy. The educational institutions of the district have been multiplied to this extent:\n\n| Year | Public Schools | Private Schools |\n|------|----------------|----------------|\n|      | Secondary | Primary | Elementary | Advanced | Elementary |\n|      | Highs | A.V.

The Anglo-Vernacular Middle Schools are at Mi\u00e1ni, Shahpur, S\u00e1hiw\u00e1l, Khush\u00e1b, Naushehra, Bhalwal, Had\u00e1li, and Sargodha. Vernacular middle Schools are at M\u00eddh, R\u00e1njha, N\u00farpur, Mitha Tiw\u00e1na, and Katha Sagral. The Primary Schools are scattered all over the district, and the District Inspector is of opinion that when 20 new schools already contemplated are built, nearly all children will have a school within\ntwo miles of their homes. The greatest interest in education is displayed by the colonists at Sargodha Tahsil, but in the Salt Range and Mohar the fact that two middle schools have been started and one raised to the Anglo-Vernacular standard indicates that the inhabitants are ready to subscribe considerable sums for their own improvement. The bulk of the rural population is, however, still apathetic, and only 39 per cent. of the enrolled pupils of the district are agriculturists, while no more than 375 Muslim boys are receiving secondary education. It is to be hoped that the zeal of Nawab Muhammad Mub\u0101riz Kh\u0101n, Mi\u00e1n Muhammad Hay\u00e1t, and other public-spirited Muhammadians in starting the Isl\u00e1mia School at Shahpur will have a stimulating effect. The schools of the American Presbyterian Mission have been noticed in section C of Chapter I.\n\nThe number of children now attending public schools is 14,795 while 3,852 attend 237 private schools, mainly devoted to the inculcation of elementary Divinity in mosques and dharams\u00e1l\u00e1s. In 1896 there were 4,833 and 3,880 students attending public and private schools respectively, so that the total number of children being educated in some sort has increased in 20 years from 8,722 to 18,647; expressed as percentages of the total number of children of school-going age, the increase is from 11\u00b77 to 18\u00b706 per cent., while the percentage attending public schools is now 14\u00b73 as against 6\u00b75 per cent.\n\nAmong the 4,607 students in the secondary standard there are no girls. In the primary schools there are 6,922 boys and 1,071 girls; in the elementary schools there are 1,514 boys and 651 girls. The sex of private-school pupils is not specified. Roughly speaking, we may say that the proportion of boys to girls at schools is as 8 to 1, and in this respect there has been little change in the last 20 years. But the percentage of female literates to the total female population has risen from '2 to '8.\n\nThere are in all 557 teachers, 483 for boys and 74 for girls; 258 of the boys' teachers are trained, of whom 230 are certified. There are also 37 boys' teachers and 4 girls' teachers who have certificates, though they are untrained. Salaries have recently been raised, especially for trained men, so there is some hope that the quality of instruction may improve pari passu with the quantity of scholars.\n\nThe character indigenous to the district is the lande akhar (tailless letters) character, a sort of short-hand derived from the N\u00e1gr\u00ed; but this is seldom used except by shopkeepers, who\ngenerally keep their accounts in this character, and few of whom can read the accounts kept by their fellows of villages at any distance. Gurmukhi and Nagri are taught in the dharmasalas and temples. But the character otherwise in universal use, both by Hindus and Musalmans, is the Persian character taught in the Government schools. Prose literature is almost unknown except in the form of the sacred books of the different religions and commentaries thereon, and practically the only form of indigenous literature is the verses composed by the local bards (mirasi) and sung or rather recited by them on festive occasions. These are of various kinds, such as the sarwar, a historical poem; the jass or panegyric; the pohri or epic; the sitth or satire; the marsia or dirge; the doha or aohra, rhymed couplets; the dhola, a poem in blank verse, generally of an erotic nature. Specimens of most of these have been collected, and published, along with the proverbs, which condense and embody the experience of past generations. The people greatly enjoy listening to the recital of these verses, and are readily moved to laughter by the satires and to tears by the dirges. The recital of original poems by school boys and master is an invariable feature of public meetings; in these considerable talent is often displayed, but horticultural and ornithological similes and metaphors are rather overworked.\n\nHistories of the Awans and of the life, times and (on the most comprehensive scale) antecedents of Malik Jah\u00e1n Kh\u00e1n, Tiw\u00e1na, of Jah\u00e1nabad, have been compiled and published in the vernacular. There are two printing-presses now at work\u2014the \"Fayazi\" at Bhera, and the \"National\" at Sargodha\u2014but no newspapers are now produced in the district. At one time the Bhera \"Dost-i-Hind\" printed in Persian character, had a circulation of some 500 copies.\n\nSection J.\u2014Medical.\n\nThere are in the district 21 hospitals and dispensaries, details regarding which will be found in Table 53. Those at Bhera, Mi\u00e1ni, Khush\u00e1b and Sah\u00edwal are maintained by the Municipal Committees of those towns, at a cost of Rs. 14,885 per annum; those at Sargodha, Shahpur, Bhalwal, Naushehra, N\u00farpur, Girot, and Midh R\u00e1njha are maintained by the District Board, at a cost of Rs. 42,255. The District Boards of Shahpur, Attock and Mi\u00e1nw\u00e1li jointly maintain the dispensary at Sakesar, which costs Rs. 1,324. The Canal Department have dispensaries...\nat Sult\u00e1npur, Rodi\u00e1nw\u00e1la, Kand\u00edw\u00e1la, Beriw\u00e1la, Wan and Mi\u00e1ni; the first named five are open to the general public, and the District Board contributes Rs. 320 to each of them.\n\nThere is a Police Hospital at Sargodha, maintained by Government. Malik Umar Hay\u00e1t Kh\u00e1n, Tiw\u00e1na, keeps up the private dispensary at K\u00e1lra, paying Rs. 671 per annum. The Bhera Female Mission Hospital costs Rs. 3,306; the District Board contributes Rs. 300 and the Municipal Committee Rs. 100, but the bulk of the cost is borne by the American Presbyterian Mission. The hospitals at Shahpur, Bhera and Sargodha (Civil and Police) are in charge of Assistant Surgeons: the remainder are in charge of Sub-Assistant Surgeons\u2014at Kalra a retired Military Officer, and at Bhera a lady\u2014all are under the control of the Civil Surgeon. In 1914, there were 9,624 surgical operations performed, of which 1,784 were classed as \"selected operations\"; no less than 752 of these were for cataract, and for this complaint Pandit Nand L\u00e1l of Bhalwal, whose professional reputation is deservedly great, treated 683 persons. The figures for attendance by sex during the year are these\u2014\n\n| Indoor patients | Outdoor patients |\n|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Male            | 2,776           | 144,667         |\n| Female          | 1,529           | 74,207          |\n| Total           | 4,305           | 218,874         |\n\nThat is to say 2 men in 5 and 1 woman in 4, or 1 person in 3 are treated during the year. During the last twenty years, the total number of patients has doubled, and the number of indoor patients has more than trebled, while the proportion of inhabitants treated has risen from 1 in 5; this is a striking testimony to the growing popularity of European medicine. The number of patients treated at the Bhera Female Hospital was 97 per cent. of the urban female population of the tahsil, which shows clearly the great service rendered by the Mission: the recent death of Miss Morgan, who had been in charge continuously for 23 years, has deprived the district of a very notable benefactress. The total expenditure of the district is Rs. 62,441 per annum, or just over 4 annas per patient. The total income is Rs. 63,135, of which Rs. 43,763 is contributed by the District Board, Rs. 14,948 by Municipal Committees and Rs. 4,424 comes from subscriptions and sale of medicines. These figures do not include the income of departmental hospitals, towards which the District Board contributes Rs. 1,600. When the new dispensary at Sill\u00e1nw\u00e1li (which is already completed) is opened there will be a dispensary for every 31,244 souls.\nIn addition to the regular medical staff, there has since 1902 generally been an Assistant and a Sub-Assistant Surgeon deputed for special duty to deal with plague, and when very severe epidemics have occurred, an extra officer of the Indian Medical Service has also been provided: the cost of this establishment is borne by Provincial Funds, while local bodies have paid for preventive measures. Small-pox also is separately combated by a staff of 8 Vaccinators; the people are now entirely in favour of vaccination, with few exceptions, and deaths from small-pox seldom exceed 3 per thousand of the population; but in 1912 and 1913 the figures rose to 3\u00b715 and 2\u00b783 respectively. Details will be found in Table 54.\n\nIn addition to these Government-managed or aided hospitals, there is a female hospital at Sargodha maintained by the American Presbyterian Mission, and visited by the Lady Assistant to the Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals. The hospital began its existence as a dispensary in 1906, and has only recently become a female institution. It is managed by Doctor Jessie Brown of Jhelum, assisted by a Hospital Assistant of 15 years' experience, and 4 nurses. About 150 in-patients and 10,000 out-patients are treated in a year, and attendances are rapidly increasing. One hundred and twenty-five operations were performed in 1914: the annual expenditure is about Rs. 4,800 and fees bring in only Rs. 400. There is also a small female dispensary gratuitously maintained by a Presbyterian Bible-reader at Bhalwal.\n\nSanitation in the villages has so far only reached the most elementary stages, and can hardly be said to exist at all. Occasionally the streets and lanes of the village site are cleaned up, but between whiles they are foul with the droppings of cattle and children, and dung-hills and rubbish heaps are allowed in close proximity to inhabited dwellings. The land all round the village is always noisome, but so long as it is under cultivation, the soil is an efficacious oxidising agent. When, as sometimes happens, a field becomes over-manured, and goes out of cultivation, it has to get all its cleaning from the sun. In the towns things are little better: the drainage of Bhera has still to be carried out, though it was determined on more than 20 years ago. Khush\u00e1b has not yet got a proper drinking supply, and in many of the villages in the Mohar and Thal Circles drinkable water is unobtainable. In the Colony Chaks cleanliness has always been insisted on as desirable, and is to some extent attained, but even here the standard is, judged from the occidental standpoint, low. It is quite certain that any attempt to raise the standard at all abruptly would be foredoomed to failure.\nAPPENDIX I-A.\n\nLIST OF DIVISIONAL AND PROVINCIAL DARBARIS.\n\n1.
