Bardrick was further charged with embezzling money to the extent of about \u00a3500l., belonging to Messrs. Desborough and Sons, solicitors, of 18, Finsbury-pavement, the prisoners' masters. Mr. Learoyd said that he was now in a position to frame the charge into two forms. One would affect Bardrick alone for embezzling about \u00a3500l., and the other would be against both for stealing bonds and obligations to the amount of over \u00a312,500l. Bardrick was cashier to the prosecutors, and it was his duty to receive money from their customers, and from the two partners, and Mr. Dallimore, their managing clerk, and pay the money so received into their bankers to the account of the firm. In many instances he had not paid the money into the bankers at all, and in other cases he had paid in only a portion of the sums entrusted to him. Although the sale of the bonds had taken place in Gold's name, he had handed all the money he received over to Bardrick. \u2014 Evidence was given at considerable length in support of the above charges.\u2014Frederick Lawley, detective-serjeant of the City Police, said that he accompanied Serjeant Randall to Spain to apprehend the prisoners. On the 11th of September Gold made a statement on board the vessel coming over. He said, \"I have been led into this affair by Bardrick, who took the bonds from the strong room, handed them to me, and suggested that I should take them to Kulb and Co., and sell them, which I did. Bardrick used to wait for me at the European, in the room upstairs, and as soon as I received the money I took it there, and gave it to him. I received a very small portion of the money. Bardrick took the first bond and sold it for \u00a3200l. just before he was married. He told me that it would never be missed. I am aware now I did wrong. I ought to have told Mr. Desborough of it at once; but Bardrick had great influence over me. If I had told him I should have been saved from ruin. I am sorry, for Mr. Lawrence has always been a good friend to me. If I had told him, I should not have been in my present unfortunate position.\"\u2014Mr. Learoyd said that was his case, and he asked that the prisoners should be committed for trial.\u2014Mr. Lickfold and Mr. Humphreys declined to make any remark, as the case must go for inquiry before another court.\u2014Mr. Alderman Fowler then committed them for trial, and refused bail.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3206253371.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 1062, "total-output-tokens": 680, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 2681, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
