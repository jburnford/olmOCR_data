It appeared that the prosecutor was a wine merchant at Sandgate, near Dover, and that the prisoner had been in the habit of dealing with him, and in the month of November, 1865, he owed him about \u00a36. The prisoner went to him on the 11th of that month and wrote a cheque for \u00a331, 15s. upon the Knightsbridge branch of the London and County bank, and he proposed to pay his bill, and Mr. Jennet gave him the balance in five \u00a3l. Bank of England notes. The cheque was presented in due course and was dishonoured, and was returned to the prosecutor, with an intimation that there were no effects belonging to the prisoner to meet it. It turned out that the prisoner had opened an account with the Knightsbridge branch of the London and County bank shortly before November, 1865, and that the amount placed to his credit was \u00a3100, which was paid in through Cox and Co., the army agents; but at the time the cheque in question was given he had no money at the bank to meet it; and, in point of fact, his account had been overdrawn by a cheque for \u00a312, 16s. being paid by mistake when there were no funds belonging to the prisoner in the hands of the bank. It appeared that the prisoner was out of the way for some time afterwards, and nothing was heard of him until the 23rd of December, when he surrendered himself to Inspector Brennan at the Bow-street police-station, and stated that he had heard that he had been advertised in the Hue and Cry, and a charge had been made against him of obtaining money by false pretences. He told the officer that there was no foundation for this charge, and that he had no intention to defraud, and his father had offered 20s. in the pound to all his creditors, but they would not take the money, and were actuated by some animus towards him, and he wished to clear himself. The deputy-judge having summed up, the jury retired to deliberate upon their verdict at two o'clock.\u2014After they had been in deliberation for about an hour they sent a message to the learned judge, to the effect that there was no chance of their agreeing upon a verdict, and they begged to be discharged.\u2014Mr. Denman said he did not feel justified in discharging them at present, and he requested them to further deliberate.\u2014They were then locked up until seven o'clock, and at that time they again stated that there was no probability of their giving a verdict, whereupon they were discharged.\n\nThe prisoner was tried on the following day on another indictment, when, after a long consultation, the jury returned a verdict of \"Not guilty.\"", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3206227122.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 924, "total-output-tokens": 739, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 3077, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
