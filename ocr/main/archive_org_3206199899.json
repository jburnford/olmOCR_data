It will be remembered that since the last examination a coroner's jury had returned a verdict \"that Emma Styles had been brutally and wilfully murdered by some person or persons unknown.\"\n\nMr. Broughton (to Inspector Porter): Are you prepared with any fresh evidence?\u2014Inspector: No, sir, not at present.\n\nMr. Broughton: Have you still charge of the clothes which the prisoner wore when taken into custody for the murder?\u2014Inspector: I have, sir.\n\nMr. Broughton: Are they complete as they were then, or has anything since been done to them?\u2014Inspector: They are not complete now, your worship; they were shown to Mr. Wakley, the coroner, at the inquest, and some portions of the articles, upon which there were marks imagined to be blood, were cut out. Two pieces were taken from the jacket, and two more from the trousers. They were given to Dr. Hassell in order that he might make a minute and careful examination thereof as to whether the marks alluded to were human blood or not.\n\nMr. Broughton: Dr. Hassell is not here, is he?\u2014Inspector: He is not, sir.\n\nMr. Broughton gave directions that a summons should be issued against the doctor to attend on Monday next, to which day the prisoner, who declined saying anything, was remanded.\n\nHe was then locked up, and at the closing of the court was again conveyed to the house of detention in the government van.\n\nPLUNDER OF THE ST. BERNARD HOSPICE.\u2014The government of the Valais has resolved to plunder the hospice of the great St. Bernard of the landed property which it held from the piety of the faithful; and which was devoted to the assistance of the poor and of travellers. This unworthy spoliation was commenced by a sale of a portion of the property on the 17th November, 1850. Further sales were to take place on Sunday last.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3206199899.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 1108, "total-output-tokens": 564, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 2335, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
