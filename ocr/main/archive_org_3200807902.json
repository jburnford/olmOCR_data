Annie Hockins deposed that deceased worked at Grace's Lead Works, Bethnal Green-road, and lodged with her. Some weeks ago deceased was in the hospital, suffering from the effects of lead poisoning. She returned to her work, but continually complained of illness after. On Sunday she had a fit. Witness advised her husband not to let her go back to the works. He said he would not. On Wednesday she was called to deceased by a neighbour. On going into the bedroom she found deceased in bed, her head hanging over the side. Martha Kilby, of 2, Catherine-buildings, deposed that she was called by the last witness. Seeing she was very ill and unconscious, she ran for a doctor, but she died shortly after his arrival. Mary Brown stated that she lived in the same house as deceased. She knew she had been to the hospital to be treated for lead poisoning. Dr. Lewis Paton, of the Mildmay Mission, deposed to being called on Wednesday to deceased about five p.m. She was unconscious and breathing hard. He tried artificial respiration, which was of no avail. She died about six o'clock. The cause of death was epileptic convulsions from chronic lead poisoning. The jury returned a verdict in accordance with that of the medical evidence. A representative of the firm where the deceased was employed being present, stated, in reply to the coroner, that every precaution was taken with regard to cleanliness. A bath-room was properly fitted up for the employ\u00e9s. A doctor went round and examined everyone on Fridays, but they found a great difficulty to get the people to be clean\u2014in fact, the deceased hid herself on the last occasion to escape examination. The coroner said he had no doubt every precaution had been taken by the firm. When lead once got into the system people employed in this class of work should never go to it again, as it was sure to eventually prove fatal.\n\nA CENTRAL NEWS telegram from New York says:\u2014\nA sad accident occurred in Fairmount Park. Two men and two women were in a rowing boat on an artificial lake in the park, when they allowed the craft to drift too near a dam over which there was a strong flow of water. The boat was carried over the fall, and all its occupants drowned.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3200807902.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 1108, "total-output-tokens": 576, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 2481, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
