They heard shots, and on going to High Tree copse they saw two men. Witness, after a struggle, secured one of them named Edwards, but the other ran away, and turned and fired on Groombridge, who was pursuing him. Groombridge fell to the ground, and on going up to him they found him dead. The man then escaped.\u2014Mr. Murphy urged that the matter was a pure accident, and the jury found prisoner \"Guilty\" of manslaughter.\u2014Mr. Justice Hawkins sentenced him to 20 years' penal servitude.\n\nFive Years for Bigamy.\u2014Robert Wilson, 24, was indicted, at Leicester assizes on Friday, for bigamy. The prisoner, who until lately was a member of the Salvation Army, was married in 1885, and left his wife, marrying a woman named Filby last September, representing himself to her as a single man, and courting her for two years.\u2014The judge sent him to five years' penal servitude.\n\nMurder at Lewisham.\u2014Mr. Wood held an inquest, on Tuesday, on the body of a woman named Louisa Smith, lately living at a common lodging-house in Deptford. The deceased woman, an unfortunate, was found in an insensible condition lying on the footway in Algernon-road, Lewisham, early on Sunday morning, the 10th inst. On the advice of the divisional surgeon she was removed to the workhouse infirmary. There she remained unconscious until her death on Thursday night. The doctor's evidence showed that death was due to an extensive fracture of the skull, occasioned, without doubt, by a blow from some heavy instrument, probably a hammer. The deceased was known to have been in company with a man between 11 and 12 on the night of the 10th inst., but there was no evidence as to his identity. The jury returned a verdict of \"Wilful murder\" against some person or persons unknown.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3206268694.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 832, "total-output-tokens": 541, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 2102, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
