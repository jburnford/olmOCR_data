available.\nSUPPLEMENT TO THE \"A\" VOLUME OF THE MADURA DISTRICT GAZETTEER.\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nPage 111.\u2014Add at the end of the page:\u2014\"The Sourashtra have also started a separate club to provide them not only with recreation but also to give them scope for the cultivation of a healthy spirit of co-operation and union. In 1908 some rich and educated members of the community joined together and by raising subscriptions among themselves erected the present fine building which occupies a fine situation on the south-east corner of the Big Teppakulam commanding a beautiful view of the tank and the central island with its picturesque grove. The club is now in a very flourishing condition with a membership of 110 and has two billiard tables and two tennis courts and a reading room. The club is open however, to all communities alike irrespective of caste, creed or colour and there are a good number of non-sourashtra members.\"\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nPage 119.\u2014Insert at the end of paragraph 1:\u2014\"There is a cotton noteworthy increase in the cultivation of cotton, the district total having risen from 6-6 in 1903-04 to 9-2 in 1912-13. The reason is certainly due to the introduction of the \"Combodia\" or American cotton. Combodia cotton was not introduced in the southern districts or at any rate it did not attain popularity among the people before the year 1903 or 1904. People saw that there was profit in the cultivation of this kind of cotton and they readily accepted it. The consequence is that its rapid extension in so short a period is very marked.\"\n\nPage 125.\u2014Insert before paragraph 7:\u2014\"The Berijam project was completed at a cost of Rs. 1,18,000. The advantage gained by Periyakulam municipality from the supply of pure water from the Berijam project is referred to in the notes on chapter XIV.\n\nPage 126.\u2014Add at the end of paragraph 1:\u2014\"The Suriliar channels and the Tenkarai channels with the tanks supplied by them are now classed as Periyar works and included in the Periyar system.\"\n\nPage 130.\u2014Insert before paragraph 1:\u2014\"In 1910 the Periyar water-shed cutting was widened and deepened and the width of the cutting now ranges from 26 to 34 feet and the level of the highest point of its bed has been lowered from 115 to 110 feet,\"\nmaking it possible to draw off 5 feet more water than before. The real difficulty for generating electricity is that in many years the supply is insufficient to permit of water being passed down all the year and unless a constant minimum supply can be guaranteed, works for the generation of power cannot be installed, the capital expenditure required being very great. To get over the difficulty, it is now proposed to form another reservoir in the Cardamom Hills, west of Uthamapalayam by damming up the Kallar river. The water from this reservoir would be diverted to the Suruliar river by a tunnel through the water-shed as was done in the case of the Periyar and would be used to supplement the water from the Periyar reservoir so that sufficient quantity could be reserved to permit of the minimum daily quantity required being passed out during the closure months. The project is now being investigated. The Kallar river and proposed reservoir is in Travancore territory.\"\n\nThe shutter gearings of the Peranai regulator which were not working properly are now being completely replaced by gearings of a more modern type at a cost of Rs. 62,000.\n\nThe carrying capacity of the canal at its head is not 2,016 cusecs but about 1,450 cusecs.\n\nThe capital cost of the system up to the end of 1913-14 was Rs. 1,05,70,165 and the total estimated capital cost is now reckoned to be Rs. 1,06,48,949.\n\nIt is difficult to say what exactly is the cultivable area commanded as in theory the whole country to the Bay of Bengal is commanded if there were enough water. The area irrigable under the present system without any new channels or any extensions of channels is about 143,000 acres. This area includes all irrigable wastes and porambokes and does not include any area in Sivaganga zamindari though a certain area in that zamindari is now supplied in almost every year.\n\nWith the idea of economizing water the area under the main canal was divided into a single and double crop area in 1909 and from that year water has been supplied to the latter for two crops and to the former for only one crop. The double crop area comprises the first nine branch channels and its irrigable extent is 75,426 acres. The irrigable area in the single crop area is 55,323 acres. Proposals for reducing the double crop area by cutting out some of the outlying portions which are difficult to supply are now before Government.\n\nThe project has almost reached its limit and very little expansion in the area irrigated is possible with the present supply available. A certain amount of extension is possible in the double crop area largely by lands not yet reclaimed and which lie amongst the existing wet lands being reclaimed and brought under cultivation. The conversion of new lands to wet in the single crop area has been already forbidden.\nSome of the difficulties enumerated have disappeared but some still remain. The supply of labour and cattle is still inadequate. Many of the ryots grow only one crop where two might be grown. This is in a measure due to the fact that much of the land is not fit for two crops every year though it might possibly be rendered fit if it were properly manured and more skilfully cultivated. It is also due to a certain extent to much of the land being owned by non-residents who purchased it either as a speculation or as an investment. Many of these owners are very ignorant of agriculture. They mostly live in Madura town but some of them live in other districts and as a rule they see their lands only very occasionally. They do their cultivation either by employing a few coolies, as few as possible, or by leasing the land on the share system to so-called tenants. Many of these tenants have lands of their own and these naturally receive their first attention. Some of the absentee owners have imported cultivators from other districts settling them in small hamlets on their lands. A great mistake was made in not confining the sales of Government waste lands to genuine resident ryots. Had this been done, the lands would be much better cultivated than they are now. Manure is still a difficulty but the ryots are now beginning to grow green manure on their fields after the crop is harvested and when this practice becomes general as it may, the manure difficulty should disappear. There are now plenty cross-roads and nothing more seems to be required than improvements to village cart tracks. No drains seem to be required and very little by way of extending or improving the existing irrigation channels. During the past five or six years the channels have been much improved especially the smaller branches and the improvements will continue till they are all in good order. The main canal and main branches are all in good order and practically all the sluices in the system are provided with shutters under lock and key.\n\nThe work of lowering the right bank escape by 8 feet and erecting across it a regulator with ten shutters each 36 feet long by 16 feet high was completed in 1907 and the full supply in the lake was then raised from level 146 to level 152 giving an increase of 2,361 millions of cubic feet in the storage capacity. The only proposal at present contemplated for increasing the water supply to the Periyar lake is to form another reservoir by damming the Pambayar, a river lying to the west of the Periyar in thick ever-green jungle. The catchment area has been surveyed and dam site tentatively selected. A gauging weir was erected across the river in 1910 and the river-flow and rainfall is regularly gauged throughout the year. The gaugings are to continue till 1917\u201318. The proposal is as yet very much a proposal. The idea is to direct the water from the proposed reservoir into the Periyar lake and to use the water from both reservoirs for irrigation in Madura. The project involves the\nbuilding of two dams and a great deal of tunnelling and probably\nthe widening of the Periyar tunnel. It is likely to be very\ncostly and it is doubtful if it will ever come to anything though\nthe supply available is undoubtedly good.\"\n\nPage 130.\u2014Add at the end of paragraph 1:\u2014\"The appeal\nmade to the High Court by Mr. Robert Fischer and others in\nthe Peranai dam suit was dismissed and an appeal made to the\nPrivy Council is now pending.\"\n\nPage 131, line 7.\u2014\"The average area cultivated was in the\nquinquennium ending 1910\u201311, 29\u00b76 per cent. larger and the\nassessment 38\u00b78 per cent. than the corresponding figures of the\nquinquennium ending 1875\u201376.\"\n\nPage 131.\u2014Insert at the end as a fresh paragraph:\u2014\"A\nnumber of co-operative credit societies have come into existence\nsince 1906\u201307. The number rose to 31 in 1910\u201311 and to 54 in\n1912\u201313 besides eleven other societies that were formed after the\nclose of that year. To quote the words of the Special Settle-\nment officer from the draft scheme report 'The Co-operative\nmovement has evidently taken strong root in this district.' In\nthe Tirumangalam taluk attempt has been made to reclaim the\ncriminal kallars by this means. As the movement gathers\nstrength it is bound to do much to ameliorate the lot of the\nrural farmer. The kallan tracts in the north of Melur are still\nthe most backward parts of the district. Wells have been sunk\nin the kallar villages of Tirumangalam but there is no great\nincrease in the number of wells in Melur.\"\n\n---\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\nForests.\n\nPages 142\u2013143.\u2014Add the following:\u2014\"In 1911\u201312 the issue\npermits for the removal of leaf manure from reserved forests\nwas discontinued.\n\nUp to 1911\u201312 exploitation and disposal of fuel from\nGovernment reserves had been effected partly by Government\nAgency and partly by sale of standing growth to contractors.\nIn accordance with the general policy of Government, depart-\nmental working was put a stop to in 1912\u201313, the Government\nfuel depot in Madura was closed on 31st March 1912, and\nall extraction and supply of fuel from reserved forests has\nsince been effected by contract agency.\n\nIn 1912\u201313 the Board sanctioned the closure of all reserves\nto goat browsing on permit. At that date goats were admitted\non payment of annas 8 per head to browse over 43,520 acres of\nreserved forest, in 1913\u201314 the area to which they were\nadmitted was reduced to 21,120 acres and this area was also\nclosed from 1st July 1914.\nThe working plans sanctioned for the Kanavaipatti and Palamedu forest ranges and for the Cumbam forest range and described in volume I have since undergone revision and modification. Modified plans were sanctioned for Kanavaipatti range in 1907, for Palamedu range and also for Cumbam range in 1912. A special working plans officer has recently been deputed to draw up fresh plans for these areas so that at the present moment it is impossible to outline the schemes.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter VI.**\n\n*Page 147.*\u2014Add at the end of paragraph 2:\u2014\"The appliances now in use provide for weaving fine figures on borders of cloth. These are said to have been in existence for over ten years prior to the publication of the present volume of the Gazetteer.\"\n\n*Page 148.*\u2014Insert before paragraph 1:\u2014\"There has been no change in the dyeing process except in the solution to be used in the second step. The roots of imburan which were hitherto largely used for giving thread a red colour have been abandoned and to make up for this, German alizarine dye which was hitherto added in a small quantity to the solution is now mixed up in a larger proportion. The change is said to be due to the greater expense and trouble involved in the use of these roots for they are costlier and have to be well grounded before they can be used. Moreover a finer and deeper shade of red colour can be obtained by using German alizarine dye than imburan roots. Kayava leaves continue to be used as before. It is said that the decrease in the import of alizarine owing to the \"European wars\" has been creating a necessity for the use of imburan roots.\"\n\n*Page 148.*\u2014Add at the end of paragraph 1:\u2014\"The manufacture of this article still continues in the same way but on a smaller scale than before by a very few Musalmans to supply a demand from other parts which is not so great as it was some ten years back.\"\n\n*Page 149.*\u2014Insert at the end of paragraph 1:\u2014\"Messrs.

Both in the Periyar and non-Periyar tracts, this crop has taken the place of the ordinary cereals such as blackgram, dholl and horsegram, etc. This is exported to Madura town, where the oil is largely used for dyeing processes, to Bombay and even outside India.\n\nThere is a ginning factory at Tirumangalam owned by Messrs. Ralli Brothers on the eastern side of the Railway station. The season commences in February and closes by the end of August of each year. Cotton is being sent to this factory from all parts of this taluk and the Periyakulam taluk. Groundnuts are also purchased in this factory and exported to Bombay.\"\n\nChapter VII.\n\nMeans of Communication\u2014Roads.\n\nInsert the following to supplement the information already given in the chapter:\n\nPage 154, paragraph 2.\u2014\"Madura now possesses 935\u00bd miles of maintained roads of which 852\u00bd miles are gravelled and metalled.

From tables showing the average number of grave crimes in the various districts of the Presidency during the years 1904-09 (before the bifurcation of Madura and R\u0101mn\u0101d) and 1910-12 (after the bifurcation) it appears that the district continues to be one of the most criminal in the Presidency.

The last two Taluk Boards were constituted in 1910, Usilampatti comprising the revenue taluks of Periyakulam and Tirumangalam, Dindigul those of Dindigul, Palni, Nilakottai and the Deputy Tahsildar division of Kodaikanal.\n\nThe number and names of the unions under the several Taluk Boards are now as follows:\u2014Some transfers having taken place owing to the reconstitution of the Taluk Boards, under the Madura Taluk Board, Tirupparankundrum Union formed in 1911; under the Melur Taluk Board those at Melur and Natham; under the Usilampatti Taluk Board those at Tirumangalam, Usilampatti, Peraiyur, Melmangalam, Keelmangalam, Bodinayakkanur, Chinnamanur, Uthamapalayam, Cumbam, Gudalur; under the Dindigul Taluk Board, Nilakottai, Ayyampalayam, Batlagundu, Vedasandur, Ayakkudi, Neikarapatti, Solavandan and Kiranur formed in 1913.\n\nThe chief item of income in these unions is the house-tax but the maximum rate is only levied in nine of them, three-fourths maximum in six and half maximum in the remaining six.\n1913-14 the highest average assessment (Rs. 2-11-5) was in Tirupperankundrum under the Madura Taluk Board and the lowest in Neikarapatti annas 7 pies 5 under the Dindignl Taluk Board. Tolls are now levied at the maximum rate allowed by the Act with effect from April 1914.\n\nAs a consequence of the redistribution of the revenue taluks in the new Madura district in 1910 among the reconstituted divisions, alterations were naturally made in the electoral circles and in the number of members which each circle returns to the Taluk Board. The elective proportion of the Taluk Board was also enhanced in 1912 from one-third to one half.\"\n\nPage 221.\u2014Insert at the end of this page:\u2014\"Proposals have a second time been submitted recommending the constitution of Bodinayakkanur into a municipality and orders from Government are awaited.\"\n\nPage 224.\u2014Insert at the end of paragraph 2:\u2014\"The scheme before the Council in 1905 for cutting a trench some two miles up the river and laying in it an 18-inch stoneware pipe was not carried out. The additional supply of water during the dry season was obtained in the usual way by excavating a supply channel in the bed of the river higher up the filter bed. With the rapid growth of the town the supply of water became inadequate. Consequently in 1913, Government sanctioned an experimental additional water-supply scheme at a cost of 11 lakhs of rupees. Towards this expenditure Government made a free grant of half the sum and sanctioned a loan of the other half repayable in 30 annual instalments.\"\n\nPage 225.\u2014Add at the end of paragraph 1:\u2014\"After considering various schemes, Government finally sanctioned a general underground drainage scheme at a cost of Rs. 22 lakhs.

Both the works were put on hand during the latter half of 1913 and the execution of the work was placed in charge of a special Executive Engineer under the supervision of the Sanitary Superintending Engineer with the Government of Madras.

The work is to be started shortly and a site has been acquired at a cost of Rs. 11,040 and handed over to the municipality.\n\nA scheme for a water-supply from the Berijam project was brought into effect in 1912 and is working well. Water from the Berijam reservoir in the hills is conveyed to the town by the Varahanadhi channel. About 2\u00bd miles west of the town a small dam is erected to force the water into an off-take and screening chamber, thence it is taken to four filter beds by a ten feet steel pipe and let into storage reservoirs which are two in number. The present distributive arrangement consists of two principal mains, 21 fountains and two hydrants and the whole scheme cost Rs. 1,93,670 of which one half was met by Government as a free gift. Forty-nine additional fountains have been sanctioned for erection in different parts of the town the existing number being insufficient. One half the cost is being met by loan from Government. The supply of pure drinking water has effected a great diminution in epidemic cholera in Periyakulam.\n\nA preliminary investigation of a water-supply scheme for the villages of Gudalur, Cumbam, Uthamapalayam and Chinamanur has been made. The cost of the scheme to supply these four towns with Periyar water is estimated at 6\u00bd lakhs of rupees with the annual working charges at Rs. 4,100. The source of supply is water from the Periyar tunnel. If the scheme be found financially practicable by the local board further investigation will be made. The water to be drawn off the Vairavanar river above Kuruvanuthu bridge will pass through roughing filters and be conveyed by about 20 miles of cast iron pipes to those villages.\"\n\nPage 227.\u2014Add at the end of the page:\u2014\"The water works scheme has since been carried through by the Public Works Department, Government meeting half the cost of the scheme. House connections are being made and public fountains have been erected and are in use throughout the Settlement. With regard to the Tinnevelly Settlement the Council has resolved that when funds are available a pipe line will be run as far as the Parapur bridge. This is probably all that could be done without a large expenditure. Most of the land near Pillar Rocks road being either reserved forest or unsuitable for building purposes, the water-supply question for that part is not a pressing one.\"\nCHAPTER XV.\n\nInsert the following to supplement the information given in the chapter:\n\nPage 232, line 1.\u2014\u201cA new travellers\u2019 bungalow has been built east of the Railway station.

A girls\u2019 school is maintained by Government.\u201d\n\nPage 258 (end).\u2014\u201cThe question of the water-supply has been dealt with in the notes to Chapter XIV. After the model of the St. Andrews Colonial Homes at Kalinpong the St. Georges Homes at Kodaikanal have been started. The Homes are for the Eurasian children of South India and stand for a recognition of the needs of that part of the Indian population which has long been neglected. The large number of European and Eurasian children who were not attending the school and also of those whose present educational training would ever leave them sadly handicapped in life urgently demanded in South India an organization after the model of that at Kalinpong. A suggestion to this effect was made in 1910 and as a result of the efforts made by the projectors the Homes were able to start work in 1914.\u201d\n\nPage 259, paragraph 1.\u2014\u201cThe European club removed from Sandaipettai to the race course in January 1909 occupied at first a thatched building which was afterwards retained as club property.

A system of electric lighting and electric fans was introduced in March 1915 and proposals have been approved by a general meeting for erecting a ladies\u2019 pavilion with dancing floor. The membership now stands at 103. There is also a golf course in the area comprised by the race course and a gymkhana club in connection with the European club. Opposite the club there is now the new Bank house while several other official residences have been built about the race-course.\n\nThe Cosmopolitan club has also its club buildings on the race course.
