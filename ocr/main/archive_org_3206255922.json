She was further charged with having on the same date attempted to commit suicide by fracturing her skull with a hammer. There was a fourth charge against her of having on the 27th of October again attempted to commit suicide while in the hospital, by cutting her throat with a table-knife. The unfortunate woman, who had become unconscious after she was brought down to court, was carried into the presence of the magistrate by four policemen, and placed on the seat at the solicitors' table, where she remained, apparently in a state of coma, during the investigation. A police inspector stated that she was better on Thursday, and that her present illness had come suddenly upon her. Evidence was then given as to the discovery of the children in the room\u2014one of them dead, with its brains knocked out, and the other in an apparently dying state, with its skull fractured; and also to the admission of the prisoner that she had inflicted the wounds, and that she attempted to kill herself by striking herself on the forehead with the hammer.\u2014Evidence was also given of the attempt by the prisoner to commit suicide while in the hospital by cutting her throat with a table-knife, which she had concealed under the bedclothes.\u2014Mr. Bolton, the Crown solicitor, who prosecuted, asked that she should be committed to the Commission for trial, and she would then be committed as a dangerous lunatic.\u2014Mr. Woodlock said he would not, in the woman's present condition, send her for trial, as she was not professionally represented, and had not heard the evidence. He would therefore remand her, and she would be sent back to the hospital.\u2014The accused, who remained unconscious, was carried out of court, and conveyed back to the hospital in a cab.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3206255922.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 1246, "total-output-tokens": 484, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 2159, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
