The gay light silk dress and train which she wore on the last occasion had been replaced by a dark garment and black cloth jacket, and her hair, which was of the lightest hue last week, was now transformed to its original dark colour.\n\nLucy Crowther, 129, Stamford-street, Blackfriars-road, deposed that the prisoners lodged at her house as \"Mr. and Mrs. Montgomery.\" She was not aware the female prisoner was acting as nurse to the male prisoner. Witness thought they were living at the rate of 2s. a day.\n\nElizabeth Nicolls, 31, Regent's-square, deposed that the prisoners lodged in her house. They were apprehended there, and had three rooms, for which they paid 12. 10s. 6d. a week. Witness knew them by the names Mr. Montgomery and Miss Ethel Vivian.\n\nMr. Krentzoon, of the inquiry department of the Charity Organisation Society, said that he instituted inquiries concerning the advertisement beginning \"Dear H,\" which had appeared in various newspapers, and received information from persons who had answered it. Among others, he received a letter purporting to come from the female prisoner, in which she said that she had authorised the male prisoner to insert the advertisement in the papers for her. It was intended, she said, for an old friend of hers, but she received answers from several persons, and the money they sent she regarded as loans, which she intended to repay. The witness had been to Oxford, where he saw two persons named Hitchman, whom he believed to be the father and sister of the male prisoner. He had also been to Ireland, to a place called Remagulton. He there found traces of the female prisoner. He traced her to the shop of Mr. Galler, a draper. She left there in May, 1876, and went to Dublin. He traced out her parents. Their name is Bowman; the father is alive; he is a lamp repairer. Witness saw her sister and brought her over with him. (The female prisoner, on seeing her sister enter the court, shrieked and fell back in the dock, and begged to be allowed to speak to her.)\n\nThe witness gave some evidence to show that the male prisoner, whom he said he knew personally under various names, was connected with an advertising agency, and had been a begging letter imposter for 25 years.\n\nThe sister of the female prisoner, Rosina Bowman, a single woman, was then called. She appeared to be a very respectable young woman, and deposed as follows:\u2014I live at 43, York-street, Dublin. The prisoner is my sister. (Here a painful scene took place, owing to the shrieks of the female prisoner, the witness being also deeply affected.) Mr. Flowers asked if it was necessary to carry the case any further. He thought it might be as well to spare the sister so painful an examination.\u2014Mr. Wontner said he did not wish to put any further questions to the witness under the circumstances, and this would close his case.\n\nThe witness was then asked, at the request of the prisoner, if their father was not formerly in a very superior position, and if they had not been reduced from that position owing to private misfortunes. The witness replied in the affirmative, and stated that her father was formerly an officer in the Swiss Guards.\u2014Prisoners were then committed for trial.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdf/3206244076.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 740, "total-output-tokens": 819, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 3505, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
